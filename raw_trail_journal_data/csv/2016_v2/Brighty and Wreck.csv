Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551121,"Time for another hike on the AT. In 2014, son ""No Pants"" completed a NOBO thru hike. In 2015, Wreck completed a flip flop thru hike. The family took nearly a year off but now it's Brighty's turn (accompanied by Wreck) but with Brighty leading the way.Her plan is a three phase AT hike. Phase 1 starts this fall with a series of day hikes on the AT starting at Harpers Ferry and heading toward Roanoke, VA. Wreck will be Sherpa/support team for this part, dropping Brighty off at trailhead, driving to designated ending for the day and then hiking in to meet Brighty and hiking back out together.If all goes well, Phase 2 will start in the Spring at Springer with Brighty and Wreck backpacking north to where Brighty got to this fall.If that goes well, Phase 3 will follow with us flipping (or flopping) up to Katahdin and backpacking back to Harpers Ferry. Ideally, we complete all three parts within a calendar year but that's not a huge priority so we're just going to see where the trail takes us and enjoy the journey!
PS. Since he will be skipping sections of the trail in Phase 1, after finishing Phase 3, Wreck plans to hike from Harpers Ferry to Roanoke to complete his second full AT hike.",,View Entry,"Oct 15, Sat",0
Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551159,"Phase 1 of our AT hike has begun. Doesn't really feel like a long distance hike yet - and probably won't until springtime in Georgia but this first phase will be a really good way for Brighty to get her trail legs after a lot of years of too much time behind a desk. Brighty started the hike in style with an ice cream come in lower town Harpers Ferry. Then it was up to the ATC Visitor Center for pictures. 2014 thru hiking son, No Pants, and great friend (and great AT leader) Laurie accompanied us today. Weather was nice, trail was very familiar. Across the Shenandoa River, up Loudoun Heights, and along the ridge top all the way to Keys Gap. The trail up Loudoun Heights was currently in the middle of a re-rout. Wreck has been helping the Mid-Atlantic crew some this fall on that project and has observed lots of dedicated folks putting in great efforts. Another example of the trail getting better one step at a time. Lots of pictures, especially from Laurie, a lunch break heading across the ridge and the first day is done. Brighty's feet, still recovering from our Rim to Rim backpacking trip to the Grand Canyon last week, hold up . . . . barely. There are a couple of Pennsylvania type rock sections heading along the ridge top. We all hope they toughen up with some more miles. For now, it's back home for a shower, dinner and a soft bed. No wonder it doesn't feel like a long distance hike yet!","Harpers Ferry, WV

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551160,"Another day, another hike. As will be the norm for Phase 1, Wreck dropped Brighty off at Keys Gap and drove to the Blackburn Center to hike back and meet Brighty halfway (or so) along the day's hike. Weather is great and trail pretty gentle. A slight climb in elevation all the way from Keys Gap (911 ft.) to the blue-blazed trail to the Blackburn Center (1650 ft). We have lunch at the David Lesser shelter - specifically on the great swinging bench under the picnic shelter. The Lesser shelter is one of the nicest in this area. Great half dovetail notching on the shelter, pleasant forest, nice camping area. Today the trail is not too busy. A few section hikers and a couple of other day hikers. Brighty still gaining trail legs (they don't appear overnight apparently) but we make it to the Blackburn Center in one piece. So much good about the Blackburn Center - a welcome stay for backpackers but also a true trail center - hosting many, many volunteer groups working on projects along the AT. The current caretakers (and long time managers), Chris and Sandi are great great leaders within the AT community. Center is named for Ruth and Fred Blackburn, more great PATC and ATC supporters from years past. The Blackburns went to the same church as Wreck as he was growing up. He remembers Ruth Blackburn, in particular, as being a very passionate and energetic person, very involved in AT land acquisition during the 1970's and 80's (if he can remember that far back!) For now it's time to lead Brighty back home and hike again another day.","Keys Gap

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551163,"Joined by Matthew, home for a quick visit in between jobs at Hatteras and Death Valley, Brighty trudges up to the AT from the Blackburn Center. It's a warm day and a couple of miles along the AT the Rollarcoaster begins, 13 plus miles of ups and downs, none too long but all steep and rocky and, cumulatively, a haul. After a few miles of hiking they reach Ravens Rock, a popular dayhike destination and, for Wreck, the nicest views along the AT between Shenandoah and Harpers Ferry. Looking straight down from the southernmost rocks is a 20-25 ft.American chestnut with fruit (burs). You see chestnut burs occasionally when hiking in the fall, especially along trails with a west or south aspect, but to look down on a chestnut tree in fruit is a treat - especially for Wreck! Unfortunately, this particular tree, that Wreck has been following for a few years now is starting to show signs of blight infestation. one branch of tree died this growing season. The way things usually progress, it would not be unusual to find the whole, above ground portion of the tree dead by next year. Ah, can't wait for a blight resistant American chestnut to be reintroduced into the eastern forest. It's coming! What comes now though is the rollercoaster and it definitely takes its toll on Brighty, ironically the family's leading rollercoaster fan. Mercifully, Snickers Gap appears, unfortunately Dirt Farm brewery in Bluemont is closed on Wednesdays. Oh well, we'll save both more trail and the brewery for another day.","Blackburn AT Center

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551170,"Up and on the road to Shenandoah NP for leg #2 of our AT journey. For those folks wondering if they missed a few hiking entries - No, we've (read Brightly) decided to skip ahead from Snickers Gap to Shenandoah NP. We'll be able to pick up those missed sections day hiking from home later on. Wreck dropped Brighty off at Skyline Drive mile marker 15.9 (well no mile marker there but the AT was!) and off she went. After a month of record high temperatures fall has finally come to our neck of Virginia. Temperatures in 40's most of the day. Great for hiking, not great for any long breaks - particularly breaks that were exposed to some pretty strong winds. Colors nice but not spectacular - perhaps due to that warm and very dry weather we've been having. Witch hazel blooming was great in some areas. Wreck has always enjoyed those plants with eccentric bloom times. Some late asters blooming too but the forest is wrapping up the year pretty quickly now. Had a nice sunny, sheltered break on top of a hill in mid afternoon. Trail was typical CCC (i.e. great) the whole day. Brighty made pretty good time, averaging 1 1/2 miles/hour. Her body is adjusting to this hiking stuff. The weak point right now is her feet; hopefully they will improve as we head south. For now though a nice day ending with blackberry ice cream/milkshake at Elkwallow Wayside. We're camped at Matthew Arm and it is suppose to get below freezing. Fed, watered, it's time to brush teeth and figure out how to stay out of tent until 7:30 pm. Ah, the ""joy"" of camping during the ""short day"" part of the year!","Skyline 15.9

Serenaded by a Barred Owl several times during the night. Then had a Red tailed hawk cruise over the campsite this morning. It doesn't get much better than that! Trail was great today, even easier than yesterday. Some longish sections that were actually flat! Sunny, blue sky day with little wind, unlike yesterday. Brighty's feet held up well - no doubt helped with a morning Vitamin I supplement. Few other hiker encounters today so had large sections of trail for ourselves. At finish line by 3:45 pm so we have some idle time. ( Wreck says ""hike more"", Brighty vetoes that.). Instead we head down the mountain to spend a wonderful evening with Brighty NPS colleague Jim and his wife Phyllis. Great food, great company!","Elkwallow Wayside

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551173,"Powered by Phyllis' delicious breakfast scramble, we're back on the trail heading south. Weather coldish, windy and the 40% chance of showers materializes as on and off drizzle much of the day. No long breaks or dilly dallying today. This is probably the rockiest day in Shenandoah (everything is relative). That, the weather, and a 1,500 ft elevational climb slows Brighty's pace somewhat but the sun actually pokes it's head out toward the end and we arrive at Skyland by 5pm, in time for a shower before a couple chicken dinners and blackberry cobbler in the dining room.

Near the horse stables Brightly sees a bear cub frolicking away seemingly unaware of the large crowd of visitors it's presence has attracted. Just north of Big Meadows, Wreck has a large adult bear wonder across the trail no more than 15 yards in front of him. Both great bear sightings! Weather remains cool and windy (wind chill never out of low 40's). Even Wreck resorts to gloves by the afternoon. Lunch stop turns into just a snack as no one hungry after the big breakfast. Arrive at Big Meadows before 3 pm - this is Brighty's dream of AT hiking, NPS lodge to lodge. Another lodge dinner (Brighty gets her prime rib) and this time, it's Wreck who doesn't make it to 9 pm - gone by 8:30 pm - as Brighty reads her Kennedy biography.","Skyland Lodge

Weather fantastic with sunny skies and temperatures in the 70's. Trail pretty easy today too. Brighty dragging somewhat due to a poor nights sleep. (We were in main lodge building with no control over heating and it got HOT - in retrospective we should have opened windows but that somehow seemed wasteful.) Despite warm weather it is apparent that winter is coming to the higher elevations of the park. Hiked several sections today where almost all the leaves were off the trees. Other sections though remained quite colorful. It's Saturday so quite a few folks on the trail including multiple Scout troops. Arrived a little before 4 pm to Lewis Mountain campground (Wreck was able to snag a spot early this morning Sometimes you plan, other times you just get lucky). A couple of sodas from the camp store, some relaxing at the campsite and Brighty suggested we drive back to Big Meadows for dinner in the pub. It is not a trip to Shenandoah unless she gets her blackberry ice cream pie! Mission accomplished and we now sit by a roaring fire - ah life is hard!

Dilly dallying around breaking down camp and fooling around with an uncooperative stove had Brighty on the trail a little later than planned (nearly 10 am). Another great day in the 70's, high clouds in the morning giving way to sunshine this afternoon. Great, relatively easy trail today. Sunday, so lots of day hikers and weekend backpackers (always the ones with the largest packs), and a few long distance southbounders. None that we talked with were too excited about hiking in cold weather. I guess time will tell about that but they still have 900+ miles to Springer and it's November in two days. But, at least for today, Indian summer was still with us. Nice colors around South River and Swift Run Gap. Finished up before 4 pm and headed back to Lewis Mountain - the cabins tonight. Showered, fed and the predicted rain has come. It's beating on the roof and we're cozy inside. Life is good.","Lewis Mountain Campground

Woke to another great weather day, cooler than the last couple of days but bright blue skies. We've been very lucky with the weather this whole week. Very nice, springy trail today with a few climbs. Up Hightop Mountain, Roundtop Mountain and Weaver Mountains today. Wreck particularly liked the fall colors in the lower elevations today. Coming up from Powell Gap today we found a great rock outcrop - sunny, sheltered, with a view. Lunch break! It was warm enough to feel like summer - until we stood up and felt the cool wind. One of the few occasions so far that we've put on a fleece after starting to hike again. Saw only a couple of folks on the trail all day - it's Monday. To Pinefield Gap before 4 pm. Down and out of the mountains to H-burg to meet No Pants for pizza and then back home. Overall a great week of hiking as Brighty continues to get her trail legs!","Skyland 66.7

Another Indian summer day with temperatures in the upper 70's. Trail, per usually for Shenandoah, is great. Springy and gentle. Up North Marshall Mountain and Compton Peak today. Brightly saw large black bear cross trail maybe 10 yards in front of her. Great sighting.   Maybe it was the warm weather, but the woods were especially alive today - grey squirrels everywhere. Guess it's time to gather nuts before the snow flies. Brighty, nursing a pulled back muscle, does well and we're finished by 2 pm.

Beautiful fall weather today. Temperature in the 60's, bright blue sky, and, while we are past the color peak still lots of color in the woods. Trail is along the heart of the AT rollarcoaster so lots of ups and downs and rocks today. The trail by the creeks in this section are all great. Even though the AT lands are fairly narrow, you get a great feeling of wildness. Quite a few hikers today. Talked with a SOBO hoping to finish by Dec 20th. That's moving! Nice father-daughter team heading south as well. We had lunch on ridge just north of Sam Moore shelter, and a afternoon snack on Buzzard Hill.    Finished by mid-afternoon.

Stopped for a couple of breaks, one on the ridge north of Rod Hollow. one at Rod Hollow shelter, where the spring is dry - we've had a extremely dry fall in these parts.

As we entered Shenandoah, both of us realized that we had forgotten to bring our hiking boots! We blame election distress! Things certainly have changed in the 10 days or so since we last hiked here. In the upper elevations it's looking pretty winter like although still some color in the valleys. Today was a another beautiful day. Cool with highs near 50 but partly sunny - great hiking weather. Trail was all below 3,000 feet, springy trail with few rocks. Brighty made nice time today - getting closer to 2 miles/hour. Just a smattering of day hikers out today - including one couple that passed heading north with music blaring - one of grumpy old man Wreck's Top Three pet peeves - toilet paper and smoking on the trail rounding out that list. Sun goes under some clouds the last mile and things cool considerably but by 3 pm we're off trail and heading toward Waynesboro.

The last 5 miles of the AT in Shenandoah no doubt has the CCC rolling in their graves. Not to complain but it just shows you what tremendous resources the CCC had when building trail. Brightly plugs along Bears Den Mountain, with cell towers galore, down to McCormick Gap, up the, ahem, steep incline out of the gap and winding down through the rocks toward Rockfish Gap. Wreck finds out the hard way that hiking in tennis shoes (remember he forgot his hiking boots at home) doesn't provide quite the feet protection needed against some rocks. Coming down a steep rocky section, he stubs his foot on a particularly sharp rock. Immediately he knows sometime is wrong. Removing his shoe and sock confirmed a toe had has assumed an unusual and unique shape. Looks like a accordion. Broken toe. He pops a couple of Ibuprofen, tapes the broken toe to its neighbor, finds two branches for hiking poles and hobbles the remaining 4 miles to Rockfish Gap. We're out a little after 4 pm.

Beautiful day for late December, highs in the 40's with lots of sunshine. Trail started with a nice uphill stretch over HIghcock Knob to warm up but the rest of the day was downhill to the James. No other hikers in the woods today but we were definitely not alone. Bedford County has a proud tradition of bear hunting and, in this week after Christmas, they were out in force. One group had maybe 8 hunters and 15 dogs, another 7 hunters and 8 dogs. Dogs were all friendly, ditto with the hunters. That said, there's something about GPS equipped dogs locating bear dens (mostly in large trees around here) and then rousing and shooting the bear out of the tree that doesn't sound very sporting to me. Personally, wish more folks would concentrate on lowering our wildflower eating deer populations instead! Ah well, on we hike, praising the weather, the beautiful views of the James on the way down, lamenting (at least Wreck) the closeness to the Devil's Marbleyard without the time to take the detour along the Gunter Ridge trail to this great area, and everyone really enjoying the last several miles of trail along Matts Creek and the James itself.

A little before noon both of us are debating whether the light fleece is even needed. 20 minutes later a storm cell moves over us and it's sleeting pretty good. Enough to don raingear but, of course, by the time Brighty has her rain jacket, rain pants, rain pack cover, and gloves on she only has about 15 minutes to walk in the winter weather before the sun makes it's appearance again. As predicted though, as the afternoon progresses the temperature drops a few degrees, the winds start to pick up and even a snow shower or two makes an appearance. Nothing major though. Trail is down from Punchbowl Gap, across the Pedlar River, along the Lynchburg Reservior for quite a long stretch and then across to Browns Mountain creek. The latter might be our favorite stretch of the day, so much of the AT is ridge top that you really appreciate those rushing creekside miles. Interesting history along Browns Mountain creek too as the community here was settled by free slaves, most living as sharecroppers until the Forest Service bought them out.

From Sky Meadows the trail runs through the Rickard Thompson Wildlife Management Area, a state area managed essentially as a hunting preserve.   Deer season has another week to go, so we are orange clad. We stop for lunch at the newly constructed Whiskey Hollow shelter. Wow what a great place! Henry and Mike (from PATC) have done it again! Just fantastic. We wander down the creek to bid farewell to Dick's Dome the older shelter being replaced. It's a unique place but we don't think too many hikers will be saddened by the change. After lunch it's over the creek and through the winter woods and up to the Trico Tower trail we go. 10% of the trail is done but winter is coming. The plan is still to reach Daleville this winter.

Taking advantage of a little warmer winter weather, we headed up Punchbowl Mountain from the Blue Ridge Parkway a little after 9 am. No other hikers on the trail today. A little ice coming down by the time we reached the Punchbowl shelter but then the sun came out and there was more sun than clouds throughout the day. Winds pretty strong and it never really warmed up above 2500 feet but dropping down to the James River this afternoon, the winds died down and the temperatures warmed up to the upper 40's. Not bad for January! Bluff Mountain (3372 ft) was beautiful with the trees sparkling with ice. Unfortunately, the warming temperatures and the wind meant that Brighty was pelted with dropping ice (some quite large) as she walked underneath. Shortly after, Brighty went off trail by mistake and spent a considerable amount of time going back and forth between a campsite, old roadbed, and old housesite before finally relocating the trail heading down the mountain. The rest of the day was pretty uneventful, a nice but quick lunch up high overlooking the James, a beautiful walk along a roaring Rocky Row Run at the end of the day.","Punchbowl Mtn. Overlook

Just a nice day to be hiking. This section of the AT is quite literally a walk in the woods. No views and mainly oak forest. Lots of leaf litter on the trail. Wreck has hiked this section several times and it always seems to have been blazed without much construction. Some smooth, large rocks along the north fork of the Piney River make a great spot for lunch (and there is a great bouldered creek crossing nearby so a shout-out to the trail folks for that). Brightly is just relieved that the Mount Pleasant fire which burned a lot of the next section south didn't reach here.

Flora of Virginia estimates a population of 28 million and the AT from Trico Tower to the Manassas Gap shelter goes right through the middle of that population. What a sight. Flora of Virginia also named the Thompson Wildlife Management Area as one of the top sites in Virginia for field botany and Wreck certainly agrees. From March through September there's always something interesting blooming. It's February now though so we enjoy a pleasant walk through the winter woods.

There had to be an architect involved in designing this shelter. It is great! Well, today confirmed the warm winter we've been having - saw hepatica, wood anemone , and fetter bush all blooming today. Wow they are nearly a month - or more - early.

We're in a short phase now (Phase 1A?) backpacking a couple of days into Daleville. Georgia (and Phase 2) is less that two weeks away! Long day today. Up and on the road a little after 6 am heading south on I-81, We set up a shuttle and were on the trail heading toward McAfee's Knob by 10:30 am. Great weather today. Sunny with highs near 70. Fantastic day to pass THE ironic photo spot on the entire AT!!! And well deserved. McAfee's is just a great spot. The Catawba valley provides a beautiful rural view (hopefully, forever!) and the Knob itself is amazing. Smattering of really nice, friendly day hikers and a couple section hikers up there this morning. We lunched at McAfee's and then headed across the mountain toward Tinker Cliffs. The long drive, and the extra weight of a backpack had Brighty ""pacing herself"". Wreck sensed trouble when about a mile from the Cliffs, Brighty announced that a nearby meadow - with a good 20% slope - looked like a nice place to camp! But Brighty soldiered on. Arrived at Tinkers Cliff in late afternoon light - always a great time of day - and scooted down to Scorched Earth Gap and the intersection with the infamously steep Andy Layne trail. Luckily, we were just staying on the gently down sloping AT at this point. Reached this campsite just before sunset which gave us time to put up the tent before dark - always a good thing. The Roanoke ATC has added a bear box so we're happy not to have to locate a tree for the bear bag in the dark - never a good thing. This is a great campsite!!! Nice little creek, picnic table, flat and grassy spot for the tent and tucked away between the hills with a feeling of seclusion even if Roanoke is only a few miles away as the crow flies.

By that time we didn't have time to mail them before the post office closed so . . . . here we are for another night. Spent most of the day waiting around thinking the mail would be coming sooner.

Both of us know that down the trail sometime we will both kill for one of the Holiday Inn Express's cinnamon buns but on the third morning of eating in Hiawassee (which followed the third evening of eating in Hiawassee) neither one of us put much of a dent in the breakfast buffet. Dropped off the tax stuff at the Post Office, caught a shuttle and were back at Dicks Creek Gap by 9:30 am. ANOTHER beautiful day (partly cloudy, mid 70's?). Especially down at the gaps Spring is coming on fast. Even some greening of tree canopy down there. Trail was a general uphill today but no major climbs and, certainly for Georgia standards, the grade was kind.   Things are looking a little dry these days. We hate to say this as it has been great hiking weather but a good rain or two would really push along the spring wildflowers. (Think that might be coming in the next few days). Nice hiking group today - it's Saturday so both long distance and day hikers - all enjoying the weather. The international appeal of the AT has been apparent - we've met folks from Austria, Canada, France, Australia, and Germany already. And of course a large variety of US states. Crossed into North Carolina just south of this Gap. Wreck actually enjoyed Georgia more this time than in 2015 - less poison ivy out this early in the Spring. We are, however excited to be in ""the Blue Devil state""!!! (You can see which one of us has the keyboard now!). First thing tomorrow we go up to 4,700 ft and don't drop below 4,000 ft again until Franklin.   Just witnessed another beautiful sunset and finally had to put on a fleece.

On Easter Sunday morning on the AT, THE place to be is Deep Gap, NC, where for 26 years 1979 thru hiker Jerry ""Tarheel"" Parker, his sister and brother-in-law ""the Cook"" and ""TAA"" and many other great folks have been hosting an Easter breakfast/lunch of legendary portions. ""No Pants"" happened upon it in 2014 and was amazed. Those of you who followed Wreck' 2015 thru hike journal (all three of you) may remember that it was the Cook and TAA who gave Wreck a magical ride from Newfound Gap into Gatlinburg (and fed him multiple sodas and sausage biscuits). So . . waking up in Bly Gap this morning and knowing he was less than 7 miles from Deep Gap it was a no brainer for Wreck to head to Deep Gap. He got there a little after 11am and wow what a fantastic time. As good as the custom made omelet, homemake baked goods, fresh fruit salad (with great mangos) and all the other super foods were it was even better to visit with all these trail angels. Great folks!!! Jerry was interviewed by No Pants back in 2014 and part of that interview is in his upcoming film ""Barbarian Utopia"" (You can see some of that interview on Facebook or YouTube using ""AT"" ""No Pants"" or ""Barbarian Utopia"" as search words.)   As good as it was at Deep Gap we both felt ourselves although missing another always great Easter celebration back on Wreck's cousins farm (in sight of the AT) in Maryland. We hope everyone ate extra shad for us!! The weather today was mostly cloudy with a few sprinkles mixed in. While we're up in elevation compared to our Georgia hiking, the flowering seemed a little bit further along (and more abundant). Lots and lots of trout lily today. Abundant ramps too. We've been seeing the effects of all the SE fires last fall. Burned area yesterday coming out of Dicks Creek Gap and today from Deep Gap all the way up to our campsite on top of Standing Indian Mountain. It must have been a really hot fire up the west facing slope of Standing Indian as all the mountain laurel was burned up. At 5,435 ft we're as high as we'll be until we hit the Smokies. Luckily it's not suppose to be too cold tonight but we can definitely feel the nip in the air. Just had two barred owls quarreling over territory seemingly directly over our tent (or maybe they were quarreling about our tent!). What a great symphony to end our day! Happy Easter!!!!","Bly Gap

Much of today was downhill, a kind grade but the big story had to be the burned out landscape. Of course, the SE fires made a lot of headlines last fall and today we saw the effects first hand ALL day. When we think of Eastern wildfires we think about low intensity ground fires. Much of today we saw the effects of a much more intense blaze. Miles of burned out rhododendron and mountain laurel, major scorching of tree trunk, some already down and, in places 6"" of duff burned off the forest floor. It will be interesting to see the recovery over the next decade or so. Trail remained in pretty good shape. We lucked out on the weather. Partly sunny all day. The predicted showers didn't materialize until we had set up camp and dinner was about to be served. Had to eat in the tent as a pretty nice thunderstorm passed over but now the clouds have thinned and we actually had a pretty nice sunset over these Carolina mountains.

A little after 8am the rain stopped and we mobilized into action (ha!). At least we began to stir. Packed up a wet tent but, all in all, it could have been much worse. Climbed up Albert Mountain this morning. Rain started again. Wreck, although he had been here only two years ago, couldn't recall anything about the trail up the mountain. Nonetheless Brighty was convinced he was purposely hiding information about the steepness of the trail (it WAS steep). That, plus the weather, put her spirits at a low as we reach the top and found out the fire tower was closed (Wreck knew one of these NC towers was closed but couldn't remember which one). We took a few pictures of the clouds (all you could see) and started down the other side. The north side was much more gentle and, indeed, for the rest of the day the trail was great. The rains stopped by the time we hit Long Branch shelter for lunch. (This has got to be one of the top ten shelters on the trail - or at least close). This afternoon the sun actually came out and Brighty was hiking in shorts and tee shirt and all was well. We left the fire burned forest of yesterday - nice to see healthy rhododendrons again. Got to Rock Gap shelter and, while a nice group there, way too many tents then the site can support. We hiked 0.1 mile to the road and down the road another 0.1 mile to this nice campsite we could see below from the shelter. A couple nice sites. Neighboring site was trashed but since there's a trash can up at the Gap we've picked up a trash bag full to deposit on our way out. Clouds are starting to move in and more rain is predicted tonight.

For the first mile or so to Wallace Gap despite the fog, or actually because of the fog, the woods had a Tokien-like feel. First large quantity of white trillium and geraniums in bloom that we've seen. After Wallace Gap it was back to the fire zone and the woods assumed a more Mordor-like appearance. Mordor post Sauron as the streams were flowing nicely and you could tell that life was coming back to the forest floor. Before too long Wreck reunited with Brighty at Winding Stairs Gap and we caught a shuttle into Franklin. Staying at the Budget Inn, modest but clean hiker friendly motel in the heart of Franklin. As was the case yesterday, the sun came out early in the afternoon and the rest of the day was beautiful. Spent the afternoon eating and taking care of logistics for the next leg: Mexican restaurant for lunch, visit to the outdoor store, and Walmart.

Not everyone agrees about Ron but we thought his was a great service to the AT community. Back on the trail we climbed out of Winding Stair Gap. Started to see more wildflowers today - white and red trillium, Dutchman's britches, squawroot, trout lily, all in quanity in spots. This morning it was mainly uphill to our lunch spot, 5001 ft Silers Bald. Weather was good, views spectacular. Talked with some nice elder day hikers from Cullowee, NC. - Wreck's rant of the day - yes, Hike your own hike but .... an amazing number of thru hikers never venture 10 ft off the AT. Silers Bald is a good example. 0.2 mile off AT to a near 360 degree incredible view and we know of only one other thruhiker today who climbed up there. We think others would really get more from their hike if they would venture a little broader - especially since it seemed that many of the folks hiking today were a little dispirited. Ah well. - Brighty, on the other hand, had perhaps her best day on the trail zooming through the morning and only slowing for the last bit of trail from Wayah Gap up to this fine campsite on top of Wine Spring Mountain. Got in around 5 pm. could have gone more, but it's a really nice spot so we sat around, had our cheese and crackers, followed by red beans, sausage and rice and finished with a nice chat with a late arriving fellow hiker.

Boy, that was a drumming campsite, grouse that is. Drumming until near sunset last night and starting up again with the sun this morning. First order of business this morning was to climb Wayah Bald (5342 ft). Stone observation tower on top. Unfortunately the wood roof and the directional interpretive signs got torched by the fires last fall. The tower survived in tact. Great, near 360 views from the top. Dropped down to Licklog Gap (now that's a name!) for lunch. As we were getting water just south of Burningtown Gap we heard thunder. Donned raingear but it turned out to be 5 minutes of drizzle. Although hiker traffic was exceptionally light today Wreck hiked ahead the last 4 miles to secure a campsite at Big Branch as this appeared to be the last known site for awhile. Big Branch campsites weren't anything to write home over. One right next to the creek that looked to get soggy quick. Two above the creek not flat at all. Wreck picked the least sloped of the upper sites, set up tent and went back to find Brighty. We ended up going out to Rocky Bald (another of those 0.2 miles spur trails that too few hikers visit) and found a great couple of campsites just down from the top. We decided to relocate (Its Brighty's birthday. She deserves a great campsite.). Wreck went back to get tent and some water. Unfortunately the rains came right before he could make it back. Sat under our Tyvak tent footprint for about an hour of steady rain. Finally, during a lull we were able to get tent up. Then the rain came again. We were just getting ready to cook in the vestibule when the rain stopped. Wreck headed out to cook and enjoy the view. The birthday girl stayed in the tent (dinner in bed?).

Nice views from the observation tower. Stopped for a late nice sunny lunch on the ridge just before heading into the Nantahala Gorge. As in previous days, many sections of trail today ran through burned forest (we talked with a couple locals on Silers Bald who said that all the fires around here were arson started). The highlight of the day, at least for Wreck, was the trail into the Gorge. Trail drops over 2,000 ft and, today, into a much more advanced spring. Light green tree canopy sprouting, lots of wildflowers blooming - false and true Solomon seal, dwarf crested iris, white clintonia, trillium and lots (and lots) more. Highlight though were the flowering Carolina Silverbell trees. The ground was literally white under some of the bigger trees. It was great! Got to the river and the Nantahala Outdoor Center in time to pick up our mail drop (Thanks Liz!) and partake in a hiker feast out front. Bought a few needed supplies (The NOC is a nice outfitters), watched the kayakers playing in the rapids and picked up a shuttle to the Nantahala Cabins where we're spending the night. It's a modest place but we've spread out our wet stuff to dry, showered and are very content - especially as a thunderstorm is upon us and it's raining pretty hard outside right now.

As we climbed we went back into early Spring. Lots of Sweet White Trillium (T. simile) in the Gorge. Very nice. The north side trail out of the Gorge was undamaged by the fires and a seemingly easier grade then the south side trail. Made it out to the Jumpoff and decided it was perfect spot for lunch. Perfect until it started to sprinkle. Went up to Swim Bald and tried another food break. Started to sprinkle again! We waited this one out and it soon stopped. Coming out of the Gorge we went by a small but absolutely great group of flame azalea. First azaleas we've seen blooming - but not the last!

We were up in time to wish the last two campers ""happy trails"" but were definitely the last two to leave camp - Brighty at 8:30am and Wreck, after taking down the tent and communing with the trillium at 9am. The trail today contained one killer climb (more on that later) but stayed between 3,000 and 4,000 ft all day. Based on what we had been seeing that was a great elevation for blooming and, indeed, all day the east and north slopes were fantastic. Bunch of different species but the stars had to be the white trillium (both T. grandiforum and simile) the wild geraniums and the yellow trillium. All in quantity and looking up or down a slope the whites, pink/purple, and yellows were super. Okay, to the killer hill. We knew it was coming - we could see it's elevation profile in AWOL's book and he even listed its name, Jacob's Ladder (anytime a climb has a name it's usually tough). Anyhoot, despite being prepared, it kicked our butts. Even Wreck, who usually puts it into extra low and just goes had to stop multiple times on the way up. Only 600 ft elevation change but STEEP!!!

Gradually we could tell it was trying to clear and just before reaching the fire tower, here comes some patches of blue sky. We got lucky and the views from the top of the tower were quite nice. Great section of Catesby Trilliums just before the tower as well. From Shuckstack to Birch Springs Gap, the trillium (white, yellow, and Catesby) and wild geraniums were fantastic.

Luckily the predicted rains never came. Unluckily, the predicted winds did. Much of the trail today was pretty buffered but on high and in the gaps it was rocking. 60 miles plus, at times blowing you several feet sideways. The worst serious tree breaking was out of the park and before the Pigeon River crossing. Several trees down across the trail, lots of snapping sounds as we passed. Brighty witnessed one large tree go down luckily downslope from her. Another hiking group had a tree go down yards in front of them.  Wreck got to Standing Bear around noon, secured a couple spots in the bunk room, found out they were without electricity - no showers, no frozen pizza, had a couple sodas, picked up food box (Liz, you are the best!!!) and around 1:30 pm went Brighty searching. She and the Australians were crossing the Pigeon. We've been hanging around the rest of the afternoon. Standing Bear definitely has a local/mountain/hippie vibe to it.  We'll leave it at that. Winds have died down, rain expected tonight and at least some tomorrow but plan is to head out and get at least some miles in tomorrow. We both have Hot Springs on our radar for a couple/few days from now. It's been nearly a week and a half since a shower or laundry so. . . They might know we're coming before we get there! NEWS FLASH The power is on at Standing Bear just as the sun goes down. We're hearing that lots of trees are down near Gatlinburg, lots of power outages.  Winds supposedly reached near 80 mph today, some roads in Great Smoky Mountains NP were closed. At least that's the story from here at Standing Bear.","Cosby Knob

Fueled by the great breakfast we decide to push for Groundhog shelter (7+ miles) for lunch. It's raining and about 50 degrees so the decision is easy. Just before the shelter the rain stops and the sun even attempts to shine through the clouds. Buoyed by the change of weather we plan to hike 3 more miles and camp. Wreck takes the lead and on top of the last climb of the day checks radar (ah, technology). It's showed some nasty weather coming our way. He hurried down to this Gap, found a nice campsite (hopefully) and set up the tent just as the rain started. Brighty pulled in awhile later. As luck would have it, the rain stopped, the sun came out so we could cook dinner, clean up and hang the Bear bag. That done the rain is back. Think it might be a rainy night and a chilly one too.

A really chilly morning - we're thinking mid 30's. It never got warmer than that all day.  Packed up a really wet tent, etc and headed up Max Patch, an open grassy mountain top with 360 views. Actually a little blue sky appeared as we got close. That was as good as it got today. Really nice views from Max Patch but the wind was really blowing and we noted patches of snow on top. Took some pictures, lingered for a few minutes and headed down. Wreck had reception and it showed nasty weather on the way. By the time we hit Roaring Fork shelter the precipitation had started, a cold rain mixed with sleet. Had lunch at the shelter and decided to go on to Walnut Mountain shelter 5 miles away. Truthfully Brighty was set to get as close to Hot Springs as she could. Beautiful flowering from Roaring Fork to Lemon Gap. Saw our first patches of fernlike phacelia (P. bipinnatifida). Walked through bright green woods as sleet and then snow continued to fall. It was quite ironic. Got on top of Walnut Mountain and it was starting to stick to the ground. As a testament both of our fondness for our Tarptent and the quality of the shelters around here, we both decided to hike down to the next Gap and tent rather that stay at the shelter. Got down here and it was still snowing pretty good. Great small stand of pine trees made a perfect tent site. Unfortunately dead tree leaning ominously toward our perfect site. Instead we pitched tent just outside of pines. By the time we got tent up it was covered with wet snow and ice. All dry inside until we got in!  We've toweled things off so all in good now. Wreck cooked in the vestibule including hot lemonade for Brighty. Enough of a weather break to hang Bear bag. We're snug in our bags - Brighty is buried far into hers.

Windy day and it seemed that the walk down was mostly in the wind. Both of us wore fleece all day (and fleece WITH puffy jackets this morning). With a couple exceptions trail was downhill from Bluff all the way to Hot Springs. Hot Springs is down at 1300 feet. Even saw some mountain laurel starting to bloom as we dropped in elevation. Trillium today looked like it had had it with the last couple days of weather (we know the feeling). Yesterday we counted up that we've seen eight different species of Trillium so far - all in locally significant numbers. Pulled into Hot Springs late afternoon. We're staying at Elmers Sunnybank Inn. This is prohaps Wreck's favorite hostel on the trail. Fantastic old house built in the 1870's, filled with fantastic antiques. A must stay!  In fact we're staying two night and will zero tomorrow.

As with most trail towns, steep trail up the mountain after running for just a short time along the French Broad river. Good switchbacks though and nice views of the greater Hot Springs area.   Trail dropped down to Tanyard Gap (passed great old pond with large concrete dam - would love to know the story behind that) and then up to the Rich Mountain fire tower and our campsite. Nice surprise today - saw JinJin who we first met on Springer, Day 1 (voted most enthusiastic) and hadn't seen since Franklin. She's coming off a little knee issue but seems to be zooming along now. Whole day it seemed that we walked on south and west slopes (lots of oak and pine). Just as we approach the peak of Rich Mountain we changed aspect - facing northeast now. Great hillside of geraniums and trilliums. Also a little windy. Nice campsite. We've been up to the lookout tower, heard and saw a pelliated woodpecker impressively drilling into a nearby tree, had dinner with Herbie, from Arkansas, whose camping here too, watching a great sunset and now it's about time to hit the hay.

Nothing big - we stayed mostly under 3,000 ft. Actually got hot this afternoon - a tshirt and shorts hiking day. Probably because of the heat we both dragged a little this afternoon. Pretty trail, pretty trees but the understory had a disturbed feel quite a lot today. We suspect lots of prior human use. Quite a few road crossings today. We took advantage of one at Allen Gap and bought a couple sodas at ""Moms"" store. Owner not very friendly - especially after Brighty asked him if he was Mom. More day and overnight hikers today than usual. Some college students enjoying a break after final exams - also a couple UNC students (I believe I heard that they don't have exams - just some paper to hand in!!!!).

Trail around 4,500 ft much of the day. Weather improved, partly cloudy skies and we had lunch on top of Big Firescald Knob. Great 360 views, warm sun - even Brighty who did not enjoy the rocky climb to the Knob- had to admit it was a nice stopping spot. Great painted trilliums, Canada mayflowers and yellow clintonia on trail to Firescald. Rocky trail down too. Dropped to Chestnut Log Gap and took on water. Decided to camp ""a couple miles north"". No good spots so we pushed over Big Butt Mountain and down to this almost great campsite. Level, isolated, beautiful setting, water nearby. Why the almost?  Some camper left a note from two weeks ago saying ""Don't camp here, Bear got my Bear bag, wasn't afraid of people"". It was a measure of Brighty's tiredness that she still really wanted to camp here so.....  we've cooked dinner, put Bear bags way up on outstretched limb of tree (Wreck remains convinced that a smart bear can get just about any Bear bag down if it wants too) and as the sun goes down we haven't had a bear sighting yet.

Trail design nice in this section but in need of some TLC. Most waterbars look like they haven't been maintained for years. Too many steps have paths around them (it kills Wreck that hikers purposefully avoid steps - walking around them leading to trail widening and erosion). Since he usually hikes faster than Brighty, Wteck has been doing occasional trail maintainance since Springer. This morning he eliminated walk arounds on 7 or so steps by placing ""ugly"" rocks or logs on both sides of the steps.

Heard some thunder but in the distance. Unaka is covered with a dense Spruce forest. So dense there is little understory at all. Very scenic. Unfortunately, the rain (and thunder) continued so we had to enjoy at walking pace. About 20 minutes down the other side the rain stopped and we took advantage of the break to have a quick lunch. Little did we know then that we wouldn't have anymore rain all day. Remained humid and seemed like it might rain. Check of radar showed some intense rains around but mostly just east of us.

A check of the weather earlier on though showed us under a tornado watch for early afternoon. We decided to hike faster. And we decided to head to one of several hostels along the trail today. Still no real climbs although we almost got to 4000 ft skirting around White Rocks Mountain. Lots of rhododendrons and mountain laurel again today. Highlight was, no doubt, Laurel Falls. It's a high volume falls anyway but was really roaring today. Trail runs along Laurel Fork for awhile and it, too was really rolling along. Great stone work around the falls particularly just below the falls where the trail follows a cut out a ledge between the water and a rock wall. Wow. That must have taken some work!  We had good cell reception so we were  able to check the radar frequently. The nasty weather seemed to slide right to the west of us. Decided to take the 1.0 mile side trail to the small town of Hampton TN. We're staying at the Braemar Castle Hostel. It's quite nice. First got into town and bought a large root beer and a bag of chips. Got to the hostel and the skies opened up. Rain didn't last too long but Brighty decided she was done for the day. Wreck walked over to the local barbecue place and brought back dinner. Good barbecue. Wreck though is dying for some fresh fruit and vegetables. Started to rain again on way ""home"" with dinner but all clear now. Tomorrow pm looks rainy again so we're shooting for an early start.

Really nice little trail to and from Hampton. Runs along Laurel Fork the whole way so not steep. At one point Laurel Fork is starting to undercut a 40-50 high cliff. Very picturesque. Lots of Fire pink blooming as well. Back on the AT it was up and down Pond Mountain. 1700+ ft climb but just great trail both up and down. The grade was always very doable. The sun actually peeked out for a couple minutes on top so we stopped for a food break. Light rain was falling by the time we got down the mountain so we took advantage of the TVA covered picnic table and restrooms by Watauga Lake to eat lunch. No camping the next 4+ miles due to bear activity (years ago). It was nice and different to walk along the lake shore. Rain remained light except maybe when we crossed the dam and the wind was really blowing there. Got to the the end of the camping restricted area and decided to go a little further. Found this great site above the lake and even got enough of a rain break to set up the tent. Rain started again so we cooked in the vestibule. Rained until 9pm but it's about stopped so Wreck ran out and completed chores. It's been blowing pretty good but the good ole Tarptent is unfazed.

One thing that did not do well was Wreck's rain jacket. He left it in the vestibule to dry and some little critter chewed 8 small holes in the arms. Urgh!!!!!  Up and hiking by 8am.  Seasonably cool today (especially in the wind) but sun was out and really it was a perfect day to hike. In the morning we continued our stroll around Lake Watauga (that is one big lake that TVA made!). Had great views looking down on the lake from a rock outcropping next to Vandeventer shelter. We took advantage to have a prelunch food break. Things have definitely greened up even above 4000 ft. Fire pink, false Solomon seal, spiderwort all blooming but the greens overwhelm the colors. Because of the great weather and because we needed a good day to get us closer to Damascus we took on water just before Iron Mountain shelter and decided to push a few extra miles. Got to this nice campsite on an old roadbed a little after 6pm and Brighty said ""done"". Hey her longest day on the trail!  Wreck used some tenacious tape and seam sealer to repair his rain jacket. We cooked dinner (Hooray!  We had enough fuel. Hopefully one more day is left in the canister). The bear bag is about 20 ft up (try to get that Mr Bear) and we just had another glorious sunset. Not too cool right now. The repaired rain jacket is lying across the top of the tent drying. We're hoping the 20% chance of rain doesn't materialize. The neoair is calling.

Trail is actually handicapped accessible for a short distance there. Really enjoyed the flora today. Last couple of days we've been going through some wood ""in recovery"". Lots of Wreck's nemesis poison ivy among other disturbance species. Today we hiked through some great sections. Lots of shoutouts (it was that kind of day). White Clintonia outstanding much of the day, huge Solomon seals coming up to McQueens Knob near day's end.      Picking up some late spring bloomers now, Bowmans root, which we first saw a few days ago in Dennis Cove, was quite abundant today. Also saw some four leaf milkweed again today and quite a lot of maple leaf viburnum. Lots of blackberry bushes blooming, a couple great pink lady slippers right next to each other and early this afternoon an outstanding patch of cinnamon ferns.  This morning's weather turned from blue skies to clouds quite quickly. Thought the predicted rains were approaching but things improved as the afternoon progressed. The sun came out again and we got all the way to this nice campsite with no rain. Set up the tent and heard some thunder. Wreck ran down to get some water but it was still just distant thunder. Had time to cook (the gas canister had enough fuel!) put up the bear bag, and get all our chores done before the rain started. It's still thundering and drizzling now. We may or may not get outside again tonight but it was another truly great day on the AT! UPDATE - Wreck's phone sounded the alarm about 30 minutes ago. We're under flash flood warning. Rain and lightening has really picked up. Just had simultaneous thunder/lightening strike that sounded next door!  We've traded iPhones and are chilling to some tunes Jimmy Buffet (Brighty) and Lionel Richie (Wreck) as Mother Nature provides the ultimate sound and light show outside.  Looks like this storm could go as Lionel is singing ""all night long""!","2miles N of Nick Grinfstaff monument

We saw a number of fringe trees blooming (first we've noticed this trip). Ditto for a bunch of Indian cucumber root. We're back in Virginia!!!  Always exciting to hit a ""new"" state. Hiked into Damascus, VA a little while later. Damascus advertises itself as ""Trail town, USA"" and it's well deserved. In addition to AT, Virginia Creeper bike trail runs through here and the paddling community is pretty active here too. Trails are big for the economy of Damascus - we wish a bunch of small town officals would visit here and see the economic benefit of having a trail nearby). AT runs right down the middle of the street (like Hot Springs). We walked to lunch at Bono McFarlands (Wreck, chef salad, Brighty, 14"" cheeseburger pizza) then to the Dancing Bear where we're staying.

Brighty does not like to walk anymore than she has to on ""zero"" days, but she did make it to MoJo's for lunch and a peach, strawberry, mango smoothie recommended by thru-hiker son, ""No Pants"" (long story). At any rate, after checking out the outfitters and some craft shops, we returned to our quiet B&B for an afternoon nap. Life on the trail can be so hard!
We're sure Damascus was anything but quiet last week-end as it hosts the largest trail festival along the AT known as Trail Days. It is basically a 3-day hiker reunion with thousands of people attending. Wreck attended in 2015 because he just happened to be coming through at that time, but we didn't make it this year since we were still in TN & didn't want to shuttle up. Maybe we'll go next year, but for now we're enjoying the peace and quiet of this lovely little trail town.

Northward we headed all the way to Mojos for another smoothie (Wreck) and frappe (Brighty). By a little after 10am we bid farewell to Damascus (we'll be back!). The AT and the Virginia Creeper trail (a rails to trails bike path) are one and the same leaving Damascus but soon we headed west climbing the ridge up to the junction with the Iron Mountain trail. Then it was down to reunite with the Virginia Creeper trail. There we had lunch on an actual bench with a composting privy and trash cans nearby. It doesn't get any fancier than that!  The AT soon diverged from the bike path but for quite awhile ran parallel to both the stream and the bike path. Eventually we climbed nearly 1000 ft pass the Saunders Shelter and several miles later to this campsite by a pond. Quite a lot of backpackers heading north today - we saw a bunch in town yesterday. Combination of thruhikers, and section hikers. Weather was glorious all morning but near the last shelter we heard rumbling and soon afterwards that 20% chance of a stray thunderstorm passed right over us. It didn't last long but pretty hard rain with wind while it lasted. Just high clouds by the time we got to camp but, after setting up tent we were just starting to eat dinner when Brighty heard rain again. Light rain but it drove us into the tent to eat.

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567041,Some days you get lucky and this afternoon was one of them. Woke up to blue skies although in our little dark hollow  we never did see the sun hit our tent. Packed up a wet one had bagels and cream cheese for breakfast ( a nice new addition) and we're on our way to another rendezvous with the Virginia Creeper trail. Couldn't resist an early break on another actual bench. Trail then climbed up to Lost Mountain shelter. Shelter area was crowded so we had an early lunch nearby at a pretty spot under a tree. (Lots of backpackers in this area - many spending a couple days and heading toward the Highlands.). Trail dipped down again to cross Route 58 before beginning a couple mile climb up to Whitetop Mountain. Good climb (we're above 5000 ft again) but nice trail design. In 2015 when Wreck thruhiked this was one of the most spectacular blooming areas on the trail. White fringed phacelia just covering the forest floor. Alas that was a couple weeks earlier in the year.  Green is now the dominant color. We got to Buzzard Rock and stopped to enjoy the views. Brighty had reception and we found they had lowered the chances of a thunderstorm from 50 to 20%. Since we had plenty of time to get to the campsite we lingered a little longer. Finally a cloud blocked the sun cooling things off enough to move on. A few minutes later we heard thunder. Then multiple thunders and dark clouds moving in. We double timed it to this great meadow and set up the tent. Within a couple minutes the rain had started and we drove into the tent. 30 minutes of hard rain followed while we marveled at our good fortune  Then the rain was turned off and the sun was back on. Within the next hour our tent was completely dry. We have a great view to the south looking at ridge after ridge as far as you can see. Currently an almost completely blue sky so we're hoping for a good night sky. Tomorrow night we're camping on top again at Rhododendron Gap (we've decided to take it easy over the highlands as we wouldn't see 5000 ft again for quite awhile.)

Woke up at 10 pm with earbuds in, unzipped the tent and went star gazing. Great sky - Jupiter now wandering through Virgo.   Later in the night we had another one of those 20% chance showers go by. Woke up to blue skies. We determined in Damascus that we wanted to camptonight at Rhododendron Gap. It's one of our favorites from Scouting Days and made for a short day so we lazed around Whitetop for awhile until the tent dried and a little after 9 am were on our way. Trail ran down to Elk Gardens where we enjoyed a food break in the meadows just north. Then we climbed up to the High Country and the junction with the Mt Rogers spur trail. The AT through the Mt Rogers High Country have really been improved over the years. Much of the credit - we think - goes to the ATC's Konarock crew which has spent a number of weeks for years working on trail improvements. It w really shows!  Great job!  Brighty had never been to Mt Rogers, highest point in Virginia, so we took the 0.5 mile spur trail through a Tokienesque Spruce Fir forest to the summit. Met a very nice NC State student and his dog up there.  From there the trail meanders the spectacular High Country with great views. We're camped at Rhododendron Gap among the long horned cattle and ponies. Naturally, just as we prepare dinner a pony and several cows head to our camp. Wreck, who's quite jealous of his food these days, had to drive a them away from the campsite as we ate. Just as we were finishing, the skies darkened, Brighty heard thunder and we hurried to finish cleaning up. Finished just in time to dive into the tent once again due to a 20% shower which only lasted maybe 20 minutes.  Hoping it clears up for some star gazing.

Lots of ponies, lots of views, lots of fun!  Catawba Rhododendron in bloom (high bush blueberries also blooming - which makes early August another of Wrecks favorite times to visit here. The Mt Rogers High Country has the best wild blueberries he's ever tasted.)  We took our time crossing the High Country today taking lots of pictures, none of which did justice to what our eyes were seeing. Stopped for a first lunch on some nice rocks in Grayson Highlands State Park. Saw a great clump of flame azalea (with cinnamon ferns in front and a perfect blue sky behind.)  Later in the day it seemed all of Stone Mountain was covered with cinnamon ferns. Coming up Pine Mountain towards the end of the day Wreck had a huge turkey take to flight right in front of him (it's always amazing to see them fly - sort of like a 747).  We had a ruffed grouse cross the trail in front of us earlier in the day. Got to this campsite about 6:30pm and Brighty's feet said ""enough"". Probably 10 other tents in the area - most we've camped with in a long time.  Down at a much lower elevation tonight (3500 ft).

Also in ""the campground"" last night was Warren Doyle's 2017 expedition minus Warren who, no doubt, was contra dancing. Warren's hiking the trail for the 18th time (although it sounds like he's not doing too much hiking so far). He's been organizing these expeditions for awhile - Wreck hiked at about the same pace as the 2015 group from Pennsylvania through Vermont and got to know Warren and several others. They essentially use two cars and dayhike the AT. Sounds like this years group isn't as successful as past groups. Several have dropped out. Down to 3 or 5 folks depending on who you talk with. Anyhoot, we left camp around 8:30am and headed up to rendezvous once again with the Iron Mountain trail on Chestnut Flats (although it was late in the day, about 21/2 miles from this shelter that we saw a number of 20+ ft tall quite healthy chestnut trees). The two themes of today had to be 1) fantastic weather, highs in the 70's with deep blue skies and 2) fantastic trail, lots of great graded sidehill contructed trail. We're in the Mt Rogers trail club domain now. Just beautiful trails. From Chestnut Flats it was essential downhill to Dickey Gap. Had our one and only lunch break today by a stream north of Hurricane Mountain shelter. Beautiful cascading waterfall later on Comers Creek. Mountain Laurel blooming pretty abundant today. Also, as has been the trend in Mt Rogers NRA, other backpackers and hikers abundant (it is after all a beautiful Saturday in June).  Another unfortunate trend throughout the trip has been dead and dying hemlock trees (due to an adelgid accidentally intoduced to this country from Asia). Went through a couple sections today with lots of large dead hemlocks in the canopy. Hemlock forest are so unique, it's tough to lose them. We got to this shelter area and found this great campsite. We pretty much cleaned out our food bags so there must be a resupply in our future. Perhaps the warmest evening on the trail (we're under 3000 ft). For the first time this trip the mosquitoes are out. So is the deet which seems encourage them to keep their distance ( at least 3-5 inches).

Plan B was to stay here and for Wreck to go in Monday morning to resupply, come  back out and meet Brighty down the trail. We're on Plan C now. Due to predicted rain tomorrow we're both going into town, zero tomorrow and start the push to Parisburg Va Tuesday am. Trail easy for the most part today. We hiked out of the Mt Rogers stewardship area and are hiking on trail maintained by the Virginia Piedmont Hiking club. We really loved the Mt Rogers section. Great resource ,of course both also the design, construction, and maintenance of the trail was very good. Leaving Mt Rogers we leave the great Southern Appalachian forest we've really enjoyed. No matter what Virginian's think most of the state to more tied to the other mid- Atlantic states than the south as far as the forest are concerned. Gone are the silver bells, the white fringed phacelia, the Frazier magnolias and a host of other species.  We are, however, beginning to see the early summer species starting to bloom (especially at this low elevation). In particular today bunches of black cohosh were just starting to bloom (and will no doubt follow us all the way to Roanoke.). The Partnership shelter is right next to the Mt Rogers Visitor Center and, in addition, to being very well built has several unique qualities 1) it has a shower attached - just cold water but Wreck took advantage anyway 2) you can order pizza delivery - we did and enjoyed a large ham and pineapple pizza plus an order of cinnamon sticks (of which Wreck ate 10 of 12). Maybe a dozen or so folks here tonight  - all nice folks.

Also saw some cucumber and umbrella magnolias. The tree canopy had a lot of big leaves in it. Shout out of the day goes to the American chestnuts. We've been seeing a lot all the way through the Mt Rogers lowlands but today may have been the best. Chestnuts dominated the understory in spots. Trees healthy looking and nearly 30 ft tall. Unfortunately we harbor no illusions that they will survive the fungus. Hopefully though by the time the next group of saplings are that big, a genetically modified disease resistant American Chestnut will be available.

We celebrated with an early lunch (gotta reduce the size of these food bags). Down across Lick Creek and then up Chestnut Knob.  Shoutout to galax, which has been with us from Day 1 (it's an evergreen) but has been blooming for awhile and was quite abundant in sections today. This was suppose to be the day for afternoon showers and, sure enough, it started to rain pretty hard early in our climb up the Knob.  Luckily by the time we reached the open grassy area (last two miles) the rain had stopped. We stopped at a pond to pick up water (lots of water, Wreck figures he was carrying over 8 pounds of water the last two miles). Despite the radar showing more rain coming we made it to this great shelter and campsite with only a little more drizzle. Great view of the valley below. Got the tent set up and then the rains came.

Particularly before Va 623 it was slow going.  We were both dragging. Just before VA623 we met a dayhiking mom and her young son. They told us about Ravens Rock with a nice view down into Burkes Garden. Also gave us several cheese sticks which we ate from the view.  The sun was great on the rocks.

We stopped for lunch by the banks of Laurel Creek.  This afternoon included a rather long (1.4 mile) road walk as we approached and crossed I77. In the ""old days"" before a permanent corridor was established there were many such (and longer) road walks. Back into the woods after crossing Kimberling Creek we climbed perhaps our steepest hill of the day up to this shelter area (0.3 mile off trail). Water is pretty scarce in this area (another 0.3 mile down a very nice switchbacked trail) so there's a crowd camping here (plus it's Saturday night).

Had reception so Wreck played Brighty a Gid Tanner and the Skillet lickers song from Youtube upon arrival. Save a few bars, we pretty much have cleaned out our food supplies. Luckily, we're about 5 miles from the Trent Grocery store, home of the AT famous double bacon cheeseburgers. Guess where we'll be about 11 am tomorrow?  For now, it's bedtime (although it's only 8:30pm). Looks like another warm night.

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568658,"Well it wasn't as warm in ole Lickskillet Hollow as we thought. Actually had to put the bags over us during the night. Brighty woke up this morning on a mission. Get up over the ridge between us and the Trent Grocery store 5.5 trail miles away in time for a bacon cheese burger lunch. Mission accomplished. The trail on the ridge was actually quite overgrown with lots of poison ivy. Coming down it was a very nice trail. Saw quite a lot of Indian pipe, a non photosynthetic parasitic plant (its white not green) blooming today. Got to the Trent (0.5 miles west of the AT) a little after 11 am. Burgers were great. We were disappointed that they don't make milk shakes anymore and their fryer was down so no potato wedges. Had some chips, Dr Pepper and ice cream sandwiches to compensate. The Trent is a nice AT staple and the owners are very friendly and thankful of hiker business. With our bellies full we headed a few more miles to Dismal Falls. Very pretty falls with a great pool in front of it. It was in the upper 80's by then so Wreck took the plunge, Brighty opted to soak her feet. It felt great - especially since we haven't showered in six days!  The AT north of Dismal Falls is quite unique - very flat, lots of rhododendron, lots of pine. Trail generally follows Dismal Creek and that's where we are camped. Nice site among the pines. Our beautiful weather is about to turn showery starting tomorrow. (Maybe tonight as it's thundering in the distance now). Luckily, we're going to be inside the next two nights (Woods Hole Tuesday and Parisburg Wednesday.) Tonight we're in our good old Tarptent with Dismal Creek and a chorus of insects singing outside. All is good.","0.2 miles S of Lickskillet Hollow

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568738,"After quite a long absence, it was nice to hear a barred owl again - even if it was seemingly right over our tent in the middle of the night.   The flat trail continued this morning. It had the feel of hiking more in eastern North Carolina than the AT.  Eventually we climbed up on the ridge top and ran along that the rest of the day. Pretty woods - lots of Rhododendron tunnels, beautiful flame azalea (ranging from dark orange to almost yellow), lots and lots of New York and Hayscented ferns. Saw a big patch of Cinnamon and Interupted ferns mixed in together ""in bloom"" which excited at least one of us.  Paused for a food break at a nice view. Just as we were leaving we heard our first thunder. About the time we hit the high point of the day (just over 4000 ft) the rain started. Rained moderately for about a mile but had stopped by the time we hit Sigar Run Gap. At the Gap we headed east down the gravel road 1/2 mile to Woods Hole hostel. Ah Woods Hole!  What a great, great place. Old log cabin restored by Roy and Tillie Woods and now run by their phenomenal granddaughter Neville and her husband Michael. Wreck stayed in the bunkhouse in 2015, this year we stayed in an absolutely beautiful room upstairs in the main house. Relaxed with some banana strawberry smoothies in the afternoon. Wreck weathered a nasty thunderstorm in the hammock under the porch of the bunkhouse. One of the highlights of the ""Woods Hole experience"" (at least for Wreck) is helping prepare the dinner. Just a normal sized kitchen (with an unbelievable collection of spices) but every day (for months and months) Neville prepares dinners and breakfasts for up to 50 people. Wow!  Today there were about 25 or so for dinner. Wreck got to prepare and sauté an onion, ginger, tomato, black eyed pea concoction (Neville added the spices). Brighty peeled ginger and sliced apples. Nearly everything served was raised or grown at Woods Hole or nearby. Homemade ice cream ended the feast. We're full, snug in our handmade 1870's queen sized bed, ready to call it a day - a very good day.","Dismal Creek campsite

Stuffed (again - but, hey collectively we've lost about 45 pounds since Springer) we headed up the road back to the AT. Another day of ridge walking, rhododendron tunnels, flame azalea, and ferns.  Summer like weather - high humidity and mid 80's (we guess). Good shade and some wind which make all the difference in the world. Stopped at beautiful view, and like yesterday, heard thunder. Luckily, for us, the rain would hold off until we were in town (we heard others behind us weren't so lucky). Trail dropped off ridge and down into suburban Pearisburg. It was about a mile to the Holiday Motor Lodge where we're staying.  Quite a lot of hikers in town.

We really don't want to get there until next Thursday so we can celebrate completion of Phase 2 of Brighty's AT adventure at the Homeplace restaurant.   Anyhoot, with a day to explore Pearisburg we headed to the DQ for breakfast (Pearisburg has had a number of businesses close recently including Nagles where Wreck enjoyed breakfast back in 2015.) We then ran errands, Brighty went to explore some downtown shops while Wreck headed to the library to transfer photos from phone to flash drive. Met for lunch downtown and Wreck headed back to the motel to clean and organize equipment. Brighty continued her downtown stroll making friends with a host of shop owners and history museum staff. Dinner at the nearby Mexican restaurant. Rained off and on from late afternoon. Got to restaurant between rains. Really poured at restaurant but fine to walk back after.

Ripe black raspberries along the road and more at the Pearis cemetery about a mile north on the AT. Nothing like fresh fruit on the trail!  We crossed the New River near Narrows, VA and became to climb the ridge. Weather hot and humid. Stopped for a first lunch a little after 11am. Another hour or so up the ridge Wreck, in the lead, stopped to filter some water, heard thunder and checked the radar. Sure enough, a couple lines of rain were approaching. When Brighty arrived we decided to rig the tyvak tent footprint into a leanto. Worked well and we emerged from a 45 minute rain totally dry (and rested). A short while later we had a great surprise - ran into fellow NOBO'er, Skip, who we hadn't seen since the Smokies. Unfortunately he's been having some knee issues and just getting back on trail. It was great to see him - just a really nice guy. So what's blooming these days?  Not a whole lot. Saw some whorled loosestrife for the first time this year, still quite a lot of fire pink, patches of spiderwort on the ridge and lots of waterleaf (although way past it's prime) and sections of abundant skullcap the last several days. We reached the Rice Field shelter and the weather was looking good. Got to this nice campsite still dry.  We've eaten, gotten water, hung the bear bags and still no rain.

North of Dichenson Gap, trail and forest much nicer. Just saw a handful of hikers today (it's Saturday but evidently this section not as popular as some with dayhikers.)  Ran into Skip a couple times. Think his knee is really bothering him.  Once the clouds lifted the weather was nice. Not as humid as yesterday. Radar showed lots of afternoon storms around (we heard thunder off and on for a couple hours) but five drops of rain was all we encountered. (Got to eat both first and second lunches in dry spots!). Ordinarily we'd be staying in the backyard of the Captain, AT neighbor and supporter. Unfortunately he is recovering from an operation so the zip line across the creek onto his property is closed.

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569230,"Ah last night, a babbling brook, good sleeping temperatures - what more could you ask for?  Well, for Wreck, some air in the mattress would have been nice. Sometime during the night he noticed the mattress was a little low. Thought he hadn't blown it up enough but , of course, that's never how it is. A little while later it's flat as a pancake and he really appreciates that 11/2"" of air he normally sleeps under. Long night. In the morning he located an 1/8"" long slit near the head on underside. Not sure what caused it but put glue dot over it and some thermarest adhesive tape. Fingers crossed!!!  Hot and humid morning. Plus for a mile from Stoney Creek north, trail went up at steeper grade than normal. That was a sweaty mile!  Luckily, as we continued to climb we hit a cooling breeze and the trail became more bearable gradewise. Went over really rocky section on top south of Mountain Lakes Road crossing. So difficult it prevented a lot of looking around - eyes on your next step. Further north along the ridge trail became much more soil-like. Lots and lots of ferns today - big swaths of cinnamon, interrupted, New York, and hay scented ferns. Among others we saw - Christmas. Bracken, lady's, maidenhair, marginal wood fern and intermediate wood fern. Also the second half of the ridge had great flame azaleas. Just scattered individuals but enough that you could always see several brilliant orange clumps in the sea of green. Very nice. Coming down from Lone Pine Peak trail again, for about 1/2 mile just dropped straight down too steep hill with no waterbars, etc at all. Result, lots of erosion, trail widening, parallel trails. Not sure if that's Roanoke ATC or Virginia Tech but hopefully a rehab or re-rout is in the plans. We've noticed quite a few sections of trail the last couple of days that need major trimming.  Not sure if these areas just too far from Roanoke or what (then again, some thru-hiker is probably saying the same thing about the section of trail that we maintain). We lucked out again with the weather. 60% showers never materialized. Got to this campsite - besides another babbling stream - had dinner, completed all the chores before a quick light rain fell.

We had low expectations for the weather today. Forecast was 90% chance of rain, over 1"" total, potential severe thunderstorms. Another humid, steep climb this morning, this time up Johns Creek mountain. Needless to say the trails in this section aren't our favorite - too many overly steep, eroded sections. (Yes, we're spoiled thru hikers!). One nice things was, like yesterday, we hit a cooling breeze about halfway up the ridge this morning. Shirts were soaked coming up but dried out running the ridgeline. Lots of mountain laurel today blooming. Very nice. Stopped for a first lunch at Kelly Knob. Weather cloudy with just a little drizzle at the end of lunch. Dropped off the ridge and picked up water from Laurel Creek. Further north the trail runs across several open pasture areas. We could see rain and hear thunder to our east and north but except few a couple brief drizzles the weather directly overhead stayed just cloudy. Picked up more water near Sinking Creek and went ridge climbing again. Just a little ways up came to Keffer Oak, second largest tree on the AT.  That's one big tree! (And much better setting than the largest tree up in New York which sits right next to the road).  Stopped for a late snack break and to assess the weather. Ran into a young nice thruhiker (whom we can't remember his name but we've run into numerous times). He had been off trail with injured toe but doing great now. While talking the weather appeared to brighten and Brighty decided she wanted to go a little further. Climbed another entirely too steep hill to this great campsite on the ridge top. The sun has come out!!  Once again we somehow managed to dodge the severe weather. Forecast now is for a couple really nice days. Sounds great to us. Dinners done, bear bags are up and it actually is cool up here a little over 3000 ft. Suppose to go down to mid 50's in valley so maybe a couple degrees cooler up here.

There's not much water in this section. This morning, a couple miles along the trail, Wreck took a 1/2 mile side trail to the Sarver Hollow shelter site to get water. The side trail was really nicely designed and built. Maybe the best trail since we entered Roanoke ATC territory. The shelter was also first class. That would be a fun weekend trip for folks around here. Further up the ridge we enjoyed a number of great views and lots of slanted rocks. One of the nice things about this last section from Pearisburg is we've started hitting the black raspberries. Today may have been the best day yet. Also picked our first ripe blueberries. Fresh fruit on the trail - it is greatly appreciated. Saw our first blooming Penstemon today, and lots of Pipsissewa/striped wintergreen.  Wreck was coming down the ridge toward the Niday shelter when he saw our first timber rattler of the trip. It heard him coming and crossed the trail in front of him. Snake and Wreck stuck their tongues out at each other until Brighty came along to see the snake as well. That proved too much for the snake and he headed off for quieter places. Trail crossed Craig's Creek where we picked up some extra water and then climbed almost 4 miles up to this monument. Audie Murphy was a decorated WW2 fighter pilot who died in a plane crash near here. Besides the monument there a great overlook nearby. Great because there are several American Chestnut trees blooming just below the overlook. That's a sight that would have dominated many a view in the Southern and Central Appalachians over 100 years ago that you rarely see today. Wreck was particularly excited. Ate dinner, put up the bear bag and went back to the overlook for a beautiful sunset. Ah, life continues to be good.","1.0 mile N of Keffer Oak

Trail started off along the ridge, then down across Trout creek where we picked up some water. Also ran across a very sick (to the stomach) German thruhiker. No reception so we helped get her comfortable and told her we would try to call for a shuttle from higher up (turns out several others hikers were also trying - we got a hold of Homer Witcher, a great Friend of the AT but by then the sick German had gotten a ride to the hostel from some dayhikers.)  Climb up to Dragons Tooth was tough - 1500 ft elevational change but it seemed like more. It was the climb that would not end. Lots of coreopsis (whorled and greater) blooming today. More blueberries to pick as well. Finally got there and, of course, it's  a great monolith. Crowd of folks there including at least 20 mathematicians attending linear algebra conference at Tech. Interesting group. Talked math on top and coming down as well. The climb down from Dragons Tooth might be the steepest on the AT in the South. Tough especially with a pack on. We were slow but made it down without blowing out a knee or falling to our death. At the road Brighty headed to this hostel, Wreck headed to the Catawba grocery. He picked up a couple sodas and hot dogs to go with our mac and cheese.

Certainly the last couple days a NOBO'er is in the state, the PA rocks (slanted and numerous) are tough but most of the state is pretty mild. Today's trail went through a couple ""rock mazes"" which had some pretty boulders but was pretty easy by AT standards. The predicted rains came late in the morning and stayed most of the day but it was just a very light rain - neither of us bothered to put on raingear (too hot).

We went for breakfast across the street - nicer than 2015 says Wreck and then headed back on the trail which for the first two miles today meant walking through nearly all of Duncannon and crossing the Juniata and Susquehanna River bridges (and passing the AT only strip club -The Cabin). Then it was up Peters Mountain on well graded trail with plenty of switchbacks. Got to Clarks Ferry shelter and picked up water for the day and for the first half of tomorrow.

Definitely warm but only really hot in the few open areas we had to cross. Trail worked its way along Stoney Mountain (still our favorite in this area) and then down to Rausch Creek. Picked up water at Stoney Creek before heading up and over Second Mountain. We've noticed several small streams the last two days that must be draining old mining areas (yes, they are orange). Reminds us of our time in West Virginia, which might be almost heaven but has bunches of acidic, orange waterways.   After coming down from Second Mountain we went through Swatara Gap State Park. Despite the parks proximity to the interstate it seems like a nice recreational retreat. The AT, other hiking trails, a bike trail and kayaking river all run through it. Just before crossing the historic iron bridge we encountered great trail magic in the form of ice cold Sprites (same place that Wreck had enjoyed a root beer in 2015). Thanks so much!!  Talked with Lucky as we were enjoying our drinks. He found a banded pigeon the other day on the trail that couldn't fly. Carried it on top of his pack for a day (the pictures were great) until he could catch ride into town to wildlife center. They evidently located the owner and were treating bird until it could be picked up. We told him that was one lucky bird (and he should change his trail name to Birdman). He told us his pack needed an extensive cleaning in the next town. Wanted to get a little ways up this next mountain before camping.  Found this nice site maybe a little too early but we weren't sure about what else was ahead.  We can hear I81 in the distance - that was our fourth and last crossing of it since we've been on the AT.  Temperature is starting to get a little colder so we're anticipating a good nights sleep.","Yellow Springs campsite

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571805,"Woke early today. Temperature was nice but you could tell it was going to be a warm one. Finished climbing the mountain we started yesterday. At the top, and for the next couple miles, (say AT miles 1184-1186) were what we both thought were possibly the worst couple miles on the AT. First because it was just covered with non native invasive species - Japanese silt grass, garlic mustard, long bristled smartweed, tree of heaven, mile a minute vine, multiflora rose - all in abundance. The only native in abundance?  Poison ivy!  Second because the trail isn't well maintained (Wreck noticed the same thing in 2015). The tread in most places is 12"" or less so in mid July all the surrounding vegetation (we're talking about you, poison ivy) has grown into the center of the trail. Ugh!!!  Thankfully the trail and forest improved afterwards. Sometime before the William Penn shelter Wreck encountered two plump white goats happily eating silt grass besides the trail. Maybe we should employ a team of goats up and down the mid Atlantic AT - there's certain a bunch of silt grass around!  Trail was fine the rest of the day flat but with some very rocky sections. Weather hot and humid but a partial cloud cover and the shade from the tree canopy helped. We reached the 501 shelter around mid afternoon. This is one of those deluxe shelters near the road. The shelter maintainer lives right next door. You can order pizza delivery from Pine Grove so, of course we did. It was Brighty's turn to choose so we had a large meat lovers pizza. Ate it while having a really enjoyable talk with the shelter maintainer, Borderline. We both took advantage of the shelter's solar shower (cool for Brighty, cold for Wreck). Refreshed and fed we headed out a little after 5 pm. The next three miles were the rockiest yet in PA. Got to this nice campsite with a nearby view. Saw a great sunset, just heard a little distant thunder but we're snug in our home away from home and ready for some sleep. Looking forward to another day on the AT!  Brighty thinks PA rocks!! . . .

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572068,"A memorable day - for good and other reasons!  No rain last night and so it was another hot and humid day.  Luckily this morning we passed by a super swimming hole near the Hertline campsite. The 501 shelter maintainer had told us about it yesterday. Beautiful blue pool created by dam on creek, rope swing on overhanging tree. It was only 10 am but too good an opportunity to pass up for Wreck, although his swinging plunge was definitely not the most graceful - it was refreshing though. Trail continued flat with very rocky sections interspersed throughout the day. Went by a little history this morning also, the Fort Dietrich Snyder monument, site of a French and Indian war outpost. Shortly before 4pm, Wreck, in the lead stopped for a break and checked radar. Looked like a nasty weather cell was heading our way. He walked back to Brighty and together they headed back to his original break area. On the way, Wreck in the lead again heard a yell?shout?cry? and turned to see Brighty galloping down the trail. Not a sight he usually sees so he headed back and find out a rattlesnake had just rattled ""good afternoon- don't step on me"" to Brighty. We alerted a couple other hikers right behind us and got some fair pictures of him heading away. We also concluded that Wreck had possibly walked three times pass the snake without noticing it. (When it rattled a second time as it headed out everyone but Wreck could hear it - water from this morning plunge had plugged up his ears worse than ever.) We decided at the rest stop that it might be wise to set up our leanto due to the approaching weather. Good move as it poured buckets for quite a while. Eventually at almost 6pm we got a short rain stoppage and decided to go no further today. We set up the tent and the deluge began anew. Needless to say, we cooked in the vestibule. Received a total of almost 2"" of rain before it died down right before dark. Wreck went out to finish chores and the whole camping site was a pool of water. Luckily our tent was on the edge of the pool but we decided to move it a couple feet further up in case more rain comes tonight. (Unfortunately, that's the prediction). Lots of damp stuff in the tent and packs  but we're semi dry and warm in our tent. Hopefully we don't float away tonight!","Round Head campsite

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572070,"No more rain last night but about 5am it started again - but just a light rain. Brighty started out a little after 7am while Wreck packed a very wet tent and headed out shortly after. Despite little rain in the last 10 or do hours the trail in spots was a stream and, in some cases, a cascading one. Feet were immediately soaked but this was the last day of our Phase3a and when you have a warm shower and soft bed waiting for you at the day's end the wetness just isn't that bad. Trail was - again - mostly flat with some very rocky sections and a wickedly steep descent into Port Clinton. Brighty, the snake magnet, was in the lead when we saw a good sized copperhead stretched across the trail. It politely moved off trail - but not too far off. We gave it a wide berth. By noonish the light rain had become a pretty hard rain (think we ended up with s little over 1"" of  precipitation today) and that continued until just before reaching Port Clinton when it nicely stopped so we could change into dry clothes at the car, head to Wendy's in Hamburg and then home. Phase 3a of Brighty's AT adventure is complete. PA was rocky on Brighty's feet, Wreck enjoyed the snakes more than Brighty but we both really enjoyed the great colorful fungi we saw. We now will head to a wedding celebration this weekend, will get in a little hiking next week (hopefully), then a reunion in CO.

Iron hand/foot holds in the really steep spots. Brighty did great (a reoccurring theme all day). With Pothole leading the way and Wreck providing an occasional helping shove from the rear we reached the Tablelands on top the mountain by 11:30 am. Another mile plus and we were posing for pictures on the summit. Great weather, fantastic views (going up and at the summit) large crowds on top. Due to time considerations we decided that we would go down via the Saddle trail (more great views). Pothole galloped down the Hunt and drove around to pick us up at Roaring Brook campground. Fantastic day. There's a reason the Penobscot Indians called this mountain the greatest. Unquestionably Wreck favorite mountain on the whole AT. Thanks to Pothole for his phenomenal assistance.

Woke to the cry of a loon - further proof, not that we need it, that we're not in Virginia. Today's trail profile looked pretty flat - but nothing in the 100 mile is too easy. Lots of roots, rocks, and short steep ups and downs. There's been a ton of great trail work through here but this is a rugged stretch of AT - the ""to do"" list of trail improvements is still a long one. Brighty's feet were feeling it today - and not in a good way. Hopefully better Vitamin I management will help. That said, this is a fantastic area. The lakes, ponds, and streams are beautiful. Yesterday we followed the shoreline of Rainbow Lake for miles. Today it was the Roaring Rainbow and Pollywog Steams. Pollywog gorge was pretty impressive. Wreck declined to get to the very edge of the rim. Great rock everywhere - huge square boulders, cliff faces all covered with moss, ferns, lichens, and, in some cases tree samplings. Love the smell of the spruce fir forest . Not a lot blooming now but lots of berries - blueberries to eat, and red (painted trillium and bunchberries) and blue (bluebeaded lily i.e. clintonia) to enjoy. Got to this great campsite on Nahmakanta Lake a little after 6pm. We borrowed two lawn chairs from  a boaters campsite down the beach and enjoyed some cheese and beef stick at the waters edge. Ate our dinner there as well.  Just as the sun disappeared a moose came out of the brush maybe 60 feet away and walked into the water for a drink. How's that for a great end of the day?  Unfortunately neither of us had our cameras ready. By the time Wreck got his it had walked further down the beach and was heading back to the woods.

Wreck sped back to the camp to make sure Brighty somehow hadn't slipped by him (and to get his headlamp for a longer search). Got to camp and there was Brighty, worried that he had gone over waterfalls. Turned out, in the time it took Wreck to check out privy, Brighty had slipped past him into camp.

Wreck enjoys more of the 15+ mile days not hiking fast but hiking longer days into the late afternoon/ early evening light. Most of this journey has been a compromise with our days averaging around 10 miles. Yesterday Brighty got her 7 mile day. Today, thanks to the fantastic Gulf Hagas loop trail Wreck got his 15 mile day. We climbed Gulf Hagas Mountain together. Down at the shelter Brighty lingered and Wreck headed down the AT which follows Gulf Hagas Brook for several miles. The Gulf Hagas loop trail is a 5.2 mile loop, 2.8 miles traversing through The Gulf Hagas gorge. Steep cliffs, plunging waterfalls and cascades, great swimming holes, lots of spur trails to views, waterfalls, etc. From the Head of the Gulf the trail loops back on a much more gentle trail. Talk about timing, at 2:40 pm Wreck coming back up the loop toward the AT ran into a dedicated group of Maine ATC trail workers who happened to have an extra pair of eclipse glasses. So right at the peak time here in Maine (60% coverage) Wreck got a peek at the eclipse. He liked the gorge better!  We rendezvoused at the West Branch of the Pleasant River.

Hiked down Chairback and up and down Columbus Mountain (higher in elevation but easy in comparison). Met some Northbounders who told us of great camping at West Chairback Pond, complete with a canoe!  We decided why not?  Lots of hikers, especially those heading north tend to get pulled into Katahdin's magnet and rush through the 100 mile.

Afterwards, we went up-stairs to visit the Monson Historical Museum. Like many small town museums, it was chocked full of all kinds of ""stuff"". A nice man gave us an overview of the local history; slate mining and furniture making were the big industries in days gone by. The area was settled by Welch, Swedish & Finnish immigrants.
Like most ""zero"" days, the main activity was eating. After a rather lengthy lunch, we checked out a couple of antique shops & art galleries. Both of us returned to the hostel for an afternoon nap after such an exhausting day. Before you know it, it was time for dinner so we went to a restaurant on Lake Hebron.

Chilly (okay, cold for August according to us Virginians) when we got up but warmed up to make it pleasant hiking in shorts by mid morning. A few rocky sections of trail but also some easy, flat, pine covered sections. One climb today up Moxie Bald Mountain. Brighty likes to tackle these mountains in the mornings. Alas we began the 2 mile, 1500 ft climb after 3 pm. It was a steep one requiring all four limbs occasionally. We're just lucky we didn't have to go down that section. Great views and blueberries on top. After the steep uphill we were not looking forward to the downhill but that proved quite tame. Of course on the easy sections is when you get careless and Brighty picked this section to have her most memorable fall yet (most have been sort of slow motion sit downs). This was a knee and hands plant on rock. Luckily nothing hurt. Got to this site after 6::30 pm and it was packed - both camping and lean-to. After much looking we found this nice flat, vegetation free site just north off the AT. Finished eating dinner in the dark (especially Wreck who must have been really hungry when he put together this  one- person  Mexican rice meal at home. It was huge!  Seems s little warmer tonight. Moose droppings nearby. Hope one doesn't run through the tent!","Horseshoe Canyon lean-to

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576551,"A warmer night than the last couple. Weather still nice although mostly cloudy this afternoon. First few miles of trail today was flat and easy. After rockhopping Moxie Pond's outlet stream we started the long 5 mile haul up Pleasant Pond Mountain. Not a particularly high mountain (2470 ft) nor large elevational climb (1400+ ft) but it definitely tested us. We'd reach a high rocky spot and think summit until we would look around, see no summit sign and then spy a higher peak further away. This went on for quite awhile until we reached the true summit. Had great surprise meeting with Speedy as we went up the mountain and he was coming down. Wreck first met him at Deep Gap for the famous Easter Sunday breakfast then again at the Sam Moore shelter, which Wreck was checking on when we were back at home. Anyhoot Speedy is doing great and hoping to summit Katahdin in less than two weeks. Fantastic to see him again!  As with Moxie Bald Mountain yesterday we were dreading what looked like a steep downhill. Luckily, just like yesterday, the decent turned out to be not too bad. Got into camp about 5:30 pm, located a campsite, (we're definitely going through a bubble of Northbounders these days) Wreck went down to Pleasant Pond to check it out (pretty but also pretty developed compared to the ponds/lakes we've been visiting - lots of powerboats and houses dotting shoreline), we cooked, have hung the bear bags, finished all our chores and are tucked in our bags. Seems pretty warm tonight too although forecast we saw said lows in upper 40's. The moon is poking out from behind the trees, Brighty heard a loon just a little while ago and we're hoping that's a good omen for tomorrow.","Bald Mountain lean-to

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576562,"Got chilly again overnight so we guess those predicted upper 40's were right.  When we arrived at the campsite yesterday we didn't notice that the site was within 1/2 mile of the Boise-Cascade Logging Rd but, about 4am we did notice that the mill was firing up the machinery for the day. The engines drowned out the barred owl that had been hooting earlier in the night. Short day today, much of it following Holly Brook into the hamlet of Caratunk. The vibe along the trail led us to stop at the Caratunk B&B for barbecue sandwiches and milk shakes which were delicious (Wreck had two milk shakes). We then walked up to the free phone near the post office (no cell reception in Caratunk) and called for our shuttle to the Sterling Inn. Wreck stayed here in 2015 and really liked it. Brighty concludes. More of a Inn then hostel, but with free laundry, free shuttles, and a free breakfast. We showered, washed clothes and had a little down time before heading over to the pub for dinner with Northbounder ""Sparks"" and a German couple just starting at Katahdin on a three month trail hike south. Great company, nice food and beverages. It's way pass our hiker bedtime but we're warm and content in our nice little room.

Alas, the weather was nice - alternating between cloudy and sunny, temperatures in the 60's. After a big continental breakfast, off we went. First business was to hike down to the Kennebec and take the canoe/ferry across. This has been the official way to cross since a hiker drown a number of years ago trying to ford. Once across we hiked several miles along Pierce Pond stream, very picturesque with nice pools, waterfalls, and rapids. Trail rooty, rocky with some short steep ups and downs for awhile. Past Harrison's camp, the trail became much more tame and we made good time. Lots of northbound traffic today. After 2 pm when the ferry stops for the day we estimate about 35 hikers went by us. There's going to be a waiting line of hikers at 9am tomorrow when the ferry starts up again. Got to this pretty spot overlooking East Carry Pond and decided to stop for the day. Considering Brighty had a hard time walking around our bedroom last evening (her knees were freezing up) she did great today. One more day in the lower elevations tomorrow and then up into the Bigalows. We're bedded down now and ready for a good nights sleep.","Caratunk Maine

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576761,"Maine's unseasonably cool late summer continues. The first day of September was almost cold. Highs only reaching low 50's with 20-25 mph winds. Great hiking weather once you got moving. Neither of us had any idea of a swim today. First part of the day took us on a tour of the Carry Ponds. Back in 1775 Benedict Arnold (when he was a good guy) led 1,000 soldiers from the Kennebec to the Dead River on a raid of Quebec. He portaged between the Carry Ponds along the way. Today the Carry Ponds were rolling, lots of whitecaps and waves. This afternoon we crossed over watersheds and come down to East Falstaff Lake which we also walked along and which was also whitecapped. Wreck lay on the beach of Falstaff for awhile waiting for Brighty. He observed a loon fishing near shore. Lots of neat looking driftwood on the beach. Lots of wave action on the nearby rocks. With the winds today the trees were swaying and moaning all day (or was it the Ents talking?). Brighty heard one mighty crash in the distance between the Carry Ponds and Falstaff. Had a great trail magic surprise at East Falstaff road. Smoking Joe (2000 thruhiker) and his family were grilling hot dogs and hamburgers. We had one of each! Plus fruits, cookies, drinks, and chips. Thanks so much!!!!  Powered by the great food we easily climbed up to this lean-to site. About half dozens other tents here. Weather forecast is calling for temperatures in the 30's tonight. For the first time in awhile Wreck is sleeping with his water filter just in case it freezes. Didn't bother to cook tonight so we easily got the bear bags up and completed all the camp chores. It's 7:30 pm and we're tucked in our bags already. Going to listen to a little music and zip up these sleeping bags.","East Carry Pond

Blue skies from the start today - the perfect weather for climbing mountains. This morning we hiked up to the top of Little Bigelow Mountain (3010 ft). Great views looking down on Falstaff Lake and up to Avery Point and the rest of the Bigelows. We then dropped down to Stafford Notch. Wreck loves this area for its huge square rocks perched everywhere. Went by a Maine YCC trail crew doing great work on the trail in this area. Next was the climb up to Avery Point (4090 ft) named for Marion Avery, the super human responsible for the initial building of the AT. It was somewhere in this section that Brighty was ready to locate the elevator to the top. Alas,none to be found but it was a slow, long slog. Lots of folks up on top - both day hikers and backpackers. Wreck raced down to the campground to secure a site and then climbed back up to take some pictures (everyone else had cleared out) and help Brighty down. We're camped on a platform (first time this trip that we converted our tent into a free standing one). Up at nearly 4000 ft so the water filter is in Wreck's bag again.

We ended up eating breakfast in the tent. Mostly cloudy skies this morning. Climbed the West Peak of the Bigelows (4145 ft). Luckily the clouds were above the peaks so we had great views. Unluckily it was pretty windy on top (over 40 mph). We took some pictures - difficult too keep camera steady - marveled at the view and headed down. Once below treeline, the wind was no problem. More rough rocky trail especially tough on Brighty's knees. Later in the morning  we climbed over South Horn.  The clouds had lowered by then so views were limited. Then down down down toward Maine Hwy 27. Great trail work (steps) on the way down. Mid afternoon the predicted rain started. (Brighty's knees were in no mood to race weather). Luckily, rain was never more than a drizzle. Reached the highway by 5pm. We had just started to hitch to town when a nice couple of day hikers popped out of the woods and volunteered to drive us in.

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577282,"Well . . .  short and longer range plans have been been made. Brighty's knee has been causing great discomfort so we decided to zero today in Stratton. A check of the forecast showed rain the next three days before clearing on Friday. This next section (lots of mountains) would not be the most enjoyable in rain (not to mention lightning) and pain so we could either wait it out here or head south. After weighing the options we decided to head south, take a little time off for knee healing and finish up  PA, etc in September. The rest of New England will have to wait until 2018. We did have a fantastic surprise when we found out this afternoon that our great friend Zen was in town - and on his 21st birthday no less!  We met him and SlimJim for dinner at the White Wolf. Celebrated with a strawberry rhubarb with ice cream dessert!  Great to catch up with Zen and meet SlimJim, a fellow North Carolinian. They're heading into the home stretch now.

Great history, so-so tour, free tastings so overall a nice stop. On the trail about 2:30 pm and it's summertime in PA. Highs in the 80's, sunny and humid. We're both drenched climbing out of Port Clinton. As with many of the gaps in PA, vegetation is really disturbed - lots of poison ivy, lots of Japanese silt grass. Not a lot of people, one dayhiker and one weekend backpacker (starting early). Knats are abundant. A couple of miles in the trail becomes pretty springy (by Pennsylvania standards). We pick up some water from the creek about 0.3m south of this campsite and talk with a couple local folks walking their dogs. Arrive at this campsite (we've heard some voices but we seem to be the only ones camping so far) in time to eat, hang bear bags, etc before darkness overtakes us. It's 8 pm now and pitch dark.

Of well, the jackets make a nice, if heavy, pillow. Nighttime lows in the 60's last night. This morning we climbed up to our two views today, Pulpit Rock and The Pinnacle. Both very nice. It's Saturday so there was a ton of dayhikers out today. Great to see. We've also are hiking about the same pace as two section hikers from Asheville, NC. Nice folks heading toward .Connecticut. About halfway between Pulpit Rock and the Pinnacle  we went by an extremely healthy looking American chestnut, probably 30+ feet tall, 6-7"" in diameter with lots of burrs in the canopy. Wow!  That was exciting (especially for Wreck -we posted a couple pictures of it in the photo section of the journal). North of the Pinnacles the rocks disappeared and the trail followed an old roadbed for over 4 miles. Brighty loved it!  Got to this campsite about 3:30pm. Wreck voted to go further, Brighty wanted to stay. We stayed. Camped along a nice babbling creek ( the same creek that flooded out Wrecks tent during a biblical thunderstorm in 2015).

Climbed Hawk Mountain first thing  this morning. HUMID!  Walking along the top of the ridge, Wreck, who had stopped to talk with a nice dayhiker was surprised to see Brighty, who had started a good 30 minutes before him, coming up behind him. Turns out, reaching the top of the mountain, she had headed straight on the Hawk Mountain trail instead of the AT. (Brighty is always looking to do some extra AM miles). United we headed across an extremely rocky section of trail - big rocks, small rocks, medium rocks - we walked on them all. Weather was quite foggy this morning so no views from Dan's Pulpit. By afternoon the skies had cleared but the rocks continued nearly all the way to the Allentown Hiking Club shelter. By then it was nearly 3 pm and we had 6 miles to go. Things were not looking good and Brighty's heel was not feeling great. But, Wreck lightened Brighty's load and the trail gods cleared the rocks from the trail. The last 6 miles were quite easy, often on old roadbeds and we made it to this campsite by a little after 6 pm. Saw a bubble of six southbounders over the last hour of hiking. They all were quite relieved to be getting a slight reprieve from the PA rocks. Our campsite is 0.2 m DOWN from the trail. Down in a dark hollow. It's actually quite nice. We're the only ones here, nice patch of white turtleheads blooming by the spring. We've eaten, the bear bag is up and it's really dark outside.

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577988,"Foggy this morning in our dark hollow. We climbed up to the AT and met the rocks leading to the big (and slanted) rocks of the Knife edge. The trail in Pennsylvania is not all rocks, or even the majority rocks. It's just that the rock sections tend to be the most memorable. And as you go further north the memories tend to grow. The Knife edge is one of the most memorable sections. Not an area you'd want to be careless on. We weren't (careless) and made it though aokay although it was still foggy so no views. Fog was starting to lift by the time we reached Bear Rocks. Talked with a birder on top observing the hawk migration. Evidently the broad winged hawks are coming through now. He said it wasn't unusual to see several thousand in a day!  We saw clouds. By the time we reached the rocks of Baked Oven the clouds had lifted. It remained mostly cloudy all day, but the clouds were much higher. Probably a dozen birders at Baked Oven. The rest of the day we saw no one on the trail and judging by the number of spiderwebs we broke no one had been north of Baked Oven shelter all day. Baked Oven shelter, by the way, has to be one of the most depressing shelters on the trail. The weather would have to be pretty bad for us to stay there. Did get some needed water at the spring and pushed on. Trail improved this afternoon so we, luckily, made better time. Moved into Keystone Trail Association territory. First impressions are good. Despite the warm weather we're starting to see some fall colors - the black gums in particular are quite nice. Got to this shelter about 6 pm.

This morning we headed down the mountain, crossed over the Lehigh River and climbed the rocks near Palmerton, Pa.   Trail famously skirts around a superfund site there (old zinc factory killed off a mountainside of vegetation and contaminated water and soil for miles). Also famous is the steep rocky climb up the mountain. They've done a nice job routing the climb but there is some hand over hand climbing with a steep drop behind you. Brighty doesn't do steep drops well so this may not have been her favorite section. But she made it over with some help from Wreck and saw a broad winged hawk and several kestrels on top. Coming around the other side of the mountain she saw several monarch butterflies. Lots and lots (whole hillsides) of white thoroughworts blooming, lots of goldenrods and a few late blooming bleeding hearts. Lots of warm season grasses blooming too (Indian grass, big and little bluestem, switchgrass) Trail had its rocks but (besides the climb near Palmerton) wasn't too bad. Nice weather all day long. Talked with a smattering of southbounders today. The theme was the scarcity of water in this section. In fact, the spring 0.6m down a steep side trail at this campsite was the only water all day. Wreck got into camp about 6 pm, quickly set up the tent and hustled down to get water (6 liters) before dark. He saw a large pile of bear scat not too far down the trail. Once again we ate under darkening skies. The bear bags are up a little higher than usual and we're ready for bed. Nighttime lows haven't been below 60 so we've been just as much out as in our bags.

On the positive side, the pipeline corridor we crossed this afternoon had been planted with warm season grasses. Felt like we were on the prairie!  Water continues to be scarce on the trail.

We've got a beautiful campsite with a wide view of the rural, mostly wooded Delaware Valley below us. Off in the far distance are the Salem-Hope Creek nuclear power plants. Lights are just starting to come on down below so I guess it's generating well. One constant throughout PA has been the sound of traffic. The AT runs close to several interstates and, of course, there are numerous road crossings. Today, however, was the exception. Pretty quiet for the majority of the day, as far as vehicles were concerned. They have been replaced by gunfire. Evidently a lot of Pennsylvanians are gearing up for the upcoming hunting seasons. At our current location the gunfire has been pretty constant since we got here several hours ago. We suspect maybe a firing range in the valley?  Seems to be lessening now (it's after sunset).

A memorable day - thanks to Brighty. Up a little earlier than usual - neither of us could sleep past 5 am (of course we have been going to bed a little after 8pm!). Heavy dew last night so it was a wet tent we packed up. Trail rocky but really the last 10 miles or so (past Wolf Rocks) aren't too bad. Lots of purple asters blooming today, lots of hikers (we entered Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area), and fantastic weather (a little cooler and less humid than previous days). We were making great time until Brighty, chatting with some day hikers missed a turn in the AT and headed down the fire road instead. Wreck, who was a little ahead, stopped at a rocky section of trail to make sure Brighty would be okay but after 20 minutes of waiting went to check on her. She was no where to be found and he figured she may have missed the three white blazes that marked the turn. He didn't figure that she would walk over a mile down the unblazed fire road but that's what Brighty did. Finally, when answering some fellow hikers questions about her trip and announcing she was finishing over 1400 miles on the AT, she was told she wasn't on the AT anymore. Up the Fire Road she went, back to the AT to rendezvous with Wreck who gave her quite a ribbing. Together we finished up this section of trail celebrating with sandwiches at the Village Farmer, before Entrrprise picked us up and we headed back to Port Clinton to pick up our car.

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593493,"Oh, happy day - and a shout out to those Washington Capitals!  Wow!  The final (?)(!) leg of our two year AT journey has begun. Delaware Water Gap to Stratton, Maine, a little over 700 miles. Drove up yesterday from Virginia via Enterprise Rental Car. Stayed last night at Santasha on the Ridge, nice B&B owned and operated by Leslie, sister of a friend and former colleague of Brighty. Had relaxing night, nice breakfast and Leslie drove us to trailhead (in town, by ice cream shop - we resisted) by 10:30am.   Weather warm but not hot - it was a day when you sweated but nothing got soaked. Crossed the mighty Delaware into New Jersey. Stopped at the Delaware Gap visitor center so Brighty could get her gray and green fix for the day. Trail up ridge (slightly up - we’re in NJ) to Sunfish Pond is a popular one. Quite a few dayhikers out.  Had lunch about a mile south of the Pond surrounded by some beautiful mountain laurel. Passed lots of patches of Mountain laurel in bloom today.  Sunfish Pond is beautiful glacially formed body of water - we think one of the most southern in the east. Took a break later on top of Kittatinny Mountain. Nice views. Lots of wooded ridges. This part of New Jersey is very rural - lots of forest.  We made pretty good time this morning but Brighty started to tire going over the rocks this afternoon (first couple day in NJ are pretty rocky - not quite to PA standards, but rocky enough.) It wasn’t until after 7 pm that we hiked into this place run by the AMC. The camping area they sent us to was full - except for one teensy, rocky site next to two cigar smokers. No way!  We found another site in the adjacent camping area. By the time we put up tent, cooked, ate, etc it was 9pm and dark. Cooling off some so we’re hoping for a good night sleep. Then it’s northward bound !!!!!  Good to be back on the trail.","Delaware Water Gap

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593540,"Pleasant sleeping weather (Brighty even broke out her liner). We both slept well. Broke camp and went over to the camp store/dining hall.  Neither of us were hungry enough for the $13 AYCE breakfast (boy that will change in time!) so we had our breakfast bars (and a coffee for Brighty) on the picnic table outside. Great morning - cool enough to be pleasant without needing fleeces. Probably lazed around a little too long but by 9:30am we were ready to hit the trail. Nice trail, nice woods, great weather most of the day. In this snapshot tour the the AT we’ve hit the mountain laurel in NJ at its high point. Beautiful again today. Not an abundance of flowering - but still, saw false Solomon seal, hawkweed, Canada mayflower, several iris (yellow and purple, cinnamon fern, maple leaf viburnum, sarsaparilla and rattlesnake weed among others. Speaking of rattlesnakes, others are seeing them among a bunch of snake sightings. We just saw one black racer early in the day. Had some nice views from Catfish Lake fire tower this morning. Had lunch above a mountain laurel lined swamp serenaded by bullfrogs. Trail was especially nice - flat and smooth - after lunch for awhile which Brighty’s feet really appreciated. Lots of lakes in this area. As afternoon progressed it seemed like mosquitoes became more abundant. They’re remained just below the deet stage through the evening. Our campsite has a nice view of Crater Lake. We’ve cooked, eaten, hung the bear bag and as the sun sets the mosquitoes have finally driven us into the tent. It beginning to cool off nicely.

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593643,"Went to bed last night thinking there was about a 10% chance of rain so it was a surprise to hear rain drops fairly early in the night. We closed our flaps and thought a passing shower. Well that “shower” lasted the rest of the night. Not a hard rain just a very light but constant one. A check of the weather forecast this morning showed our 10% of rain today had turned into 100% all day. It was time to adjust one’s expectations. Luckily, the rain nearly stopped for awhile giving us time to pack and eat and hit the trail. For most of the morning it was more “spitting” than a rain. Seemed to keep the mosquitoes down especially if you kept hiking.  We had our first fall today and it was . . . .  Wreck!  Early on he stepped on a slanted, wet, and extremely slick rock and was sent flying. Luckily (he says deftly) he was able to twist around so his pack absorbed most of the impact with the nearby rocks. Bruised upper leg, bruised ego and he was up and hiking although both of us went more carefully afterwards.  We been passing quite a lot of hemlock the last two days. 15 years ago we never would have thought so many would be still alive but, up and down the AT you see them. Some of today’s were quite healthy looking too but mostly pretty young trees. By afternoon the weather had transitioned to a light rain. We decided to go into Gyp Tavern for a second lunch(0.2 m off trail - one of the nice bonuses of the trail through NJ and NY). Wreck had been to Gyps in 2015 for a burger and fries and we both went the same route. Okay food, interesting patrons. You definitely know it’s a local clientele when folks are wearing “I’ve been Gyped” sweatshirts!  Still raining as we left much to Brighty’s dismay. Rain though pretty much stopped by the time we reached the Culver Mtn fire tower. Ham radio convention there - the second weekend in June everywhere in the US. They were talking to Arizona as we went by. Had interesting conversation with several folks. You have to admire their passion. Plus their dedication - had three 30’ antennas plus countless other antennas attached to the fire tower. All brought up Thursday and coming down with them tomorrow. Got into this campsite about 7pm. Our “second lunch” is turning into our dinner as neither one of us is too hungry. Chiller tonight (supposed to be 45 tomorrow night!!). Haven’t seen any of the notorious NJ bears yet but bear bags way way up tonight. Looking forward to tomorrow and another day on the trail!","Campsite above Crater Lake

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593913,"We like New Jersey!  In general, pretty woods (much less disturbed than much of PA), pretty ponds and lakes (although the streams so far have been slow and tannin colored brown), and pretty trail (some rocks but not like PA). And today’s weather was fantastic!  Cold front passed by last night so we had a low humidity, sunny day in the 70’s. Perfect for hiking.  Stopped for an early lunch on top of  Sunrise Mountain (elevation 1653 ft - this is Jersey - they don’t get too much higher!)  We haven’t seen as much hiking activity as we thought we would - well fewer than a dozen folks/day and then mostly section hikers. Don’t know if the torrential May rains we had caused a lot of thru hikers to drop out or if we’re just between bubbles right now. This afternoon we were prepared to face the mosquitoes (we’re packing 100% deet) as Wreck’ journal from 2015 mentioned this area as having “clouds of mosquitoes”. Fortunately, not this year - at least today.   Got into this beautiful campsite about 6 pm -  got water ( the stream was slow but not brown -Hooray!), and prepared “our house” for the night. Supposed to be chilly (Brighty thought last night was more than chilly) so we’ve got all the clothing we’ve brought handy just in case. Tomorrow we’re going to have a short day (to give Brighty’s feet a rest) and go to the Jersey shore!!! - at least the shore of the lake at High Point State Park.

Chatted with the Park Ranger there. We had met him and a colleague on the trail yesterday and thought they were State Police (still not quite sure the relationship between agencies is as one patch on their uniform says State Police and the other patch says State Park). Anyhoot, nice folks. Then it was time to head down to the Jersey shore albeit the shores of Lake Marcia. Nice little sandy beach, picnic area, bathhouse, and quite a few beach goers already there. Unfortunately the concession area was closed (only open on weekends until July).  Suddenly our vision of hamburgers, Dr Peppers, and ice cream vanished!  Oh well, we had a lunch of Peanut butter and Wasa crackers with M&M’s for dessert and still enjoyed the afternoon. Brighty dipped her toes in the water, Wreck eventually plunged in and we enjoyed the blue skies and light breeze. Took advantage of some hot showers in the bathhouse and then hiked up to this shelter (Wreck took the side trip to the monument on top of the highest point in New Jersey - 1811 ft).

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594126,"Not all the AT is mountain ridges and majestic views.  The continuous nature of the trail necessitates that some sections of trail are there to connect the mountains together. In some respects, the whole MidAtlantic region connects the Blue Ridge of Virginia with the Green Mountains of New England. So it was that today we came off High Point Mountain this morning on an AT section looking to connect us with another mountain. And we enjoyed it!  Hats off to the folks that established this lowland corridor we hiked through. It had some pretty woods, pastoral fields, beautiful wetlands, a couple scenic creeks. In short - a nice walk through the woods ( and fields). Light rain started shortly after we got started today and continued most of the morning. Not enough to don any more protection than a pack cover. Stopped in Unionville,NY for lunch at Unionville’s finest Italian restaurant. ( for much of the day we were tiptoeing the NJ/NY state line, mostly in NJ but occasionally in NY. ) Stuffed ourselves with spaghetti and a shared 2 liter Dr Pepper. Got a few resupplies next door at the grocery, hung out on their front porch for quite awhile charging our phones and watching life in Unionville pass us by. This afternoon we passed through Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge. Enjoyed the wetlands and the bird life. Finally found our connecting mountain, Pochuck Mountain late this afternoon. Wreck went and got water from the outside spigot and an abandoned house at the base of the mountain (go figure, but it’s been a great water source for years) and we climbed up to this shelter site. Hadn’t seen more that a handful of hikers all day but this site was full of folks ( with more still coming in). Weather improved this afternoon and just high clouds right now. We’ve stuffed ourselves again and are about ready to call it a night. A good night.","High Point shelter

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594243,"Brighty loves boardwalks- and we went over the AT’s finest today. First though we had to negotiate a couple steep mid- size climbs on Pochuck Mountain. Yesterday the AT spend all day finding Pochuck but this morning we parted ways as the trail went up, over, and down the other side of Pochuck. That brought us to the fantastic boardwalk through the wetlands of Wawayanda State Park. 0.7 m of elevated boardwalk with a fine suspension bridge over Pochuck Creek toward the north end. Brighty who has always loved marshes was in her element (the flatness of the walking didn’t hurt). After another mile or so of lowland walking (and some more conventional boardwalks) we reached NJ94. A short walk down the highway to Heaven Hill Farm for some lunch (and ice cream!). After lunch the trail abruptly climbed 1,000 feet up Wawayanda Mountain. It was our steepest climb in New Jersey. Lots and lots of steps (and to Brighty’s dismay - they were monster big steps). Nice views though from on top. The rest of the afternoon was a nice rolling trail. Reached this campground around 6 pm. Met the same nice ridge runner we saw down at Sunfish Pond our first day out. Had nice conversation. Pretty big crowd here but we found nice flat site.  Weather was fantastic again today. Seems like it might be even a little warm out tonight. Tomorrow we leave New Jersey for good and enter New York. Wreck really liked southern NY last time so we’re looking forward to that.

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594383,"As mentioned yesterday, Brighty loves boardwalks. Rock outcrops that required all four limbs to climb? - not so much!  Yet that was what the trail provided today. Last night was a cooler night then we expected. Brighty broke out both her liner and emergency space blanket during the night. Wreck looked over and thought a large baked potato had invaded the tent. We’ve been camping with an “early in, early out” group the last couple of days. By 7 am most folks are on the trail. Despite this being a “town day” we slept in (maybe the coolish weather had an influence?) and didn’t start hiking until 8:30 am. The last few miles in New Jersey were uneventful. Never did see a bear although New Jersey has the densest population of bear along the AT. The New Jersey/New York state line has to be one of the most modest on the trail. White paint on rock with NJ on one side of line and NY on other side. Immediately upon entering New York we hit the rock outcrops. Wreck really likes this section - particularly on a nice day (and the weather once again was fantastic!). Brighty not so much. Next couple miles were  near constant outcrops. Trail weaved it’s way over them with the occasional need to use all four limbs to climb over the rock (one section aided by a ladder of iron rebar). Several great views to the east of Greenwood Lake. Eventually the outcrops ceased and we hiked the rest of the way to the Vista trail which took us down into the village of Greenwood Lake. Down being the appropriate adjective ( steep down, toe punishing would be even better according to Brighty). A treat for Wreck coming down was, while waiting on a rock for Brighty, he had a scarlet tangier whizz right by him and perch on a log about 10 feet away. Beautiful birds!  Hiked the last bit into town with young couple that we’d seen off and on the last couple of days. They’re hiking the trail on their honeymoon!  Got to the Breezy Point Inn about 5 pm and after hot showers and great dinner and a chance to elevate our feet all is good.

Clothes weren’t real dry in the morning so we tried the hair drier with minimal success (putting them on worked much better - when backpacking your body is the best heater/drier). Had brunch at the Salt and Pepper cafe. New place, very friendly, good food. Got some resupply items at the little market and while Brighty headed up the Vista trail Wreck headed to CVS for some foot supplies for Brighty and then a large cherry slurpee like drink at Cumberland Farms. By the time he reached the Vista trail he still had half the drink to finish so he watched an inning or so of a 6-7? year old baseball game at the  Lions field. Coach pitching to players. Wreck saw only one player actually hit the ball. Finished the drink and up the Vista trail he went to rejoin Brighty waiting at the AT intersection. First couple of miles to Hwy 17A were a pleasant walk in the woods. Went to the Bellvale Farms Creamery (0.3 m West) - possibly the best and most popular creamery on the trail. Place was packed on a Tuesday night when Wreck stopped by in 2015 and it was packed this afternoon. We got fantastic milk shakes (vanilla and coconut with chocolate covered almonds - those who know us can figure out who got which) and headed back up the trail. Climbed two rock outcrops with great views - the Pinnacles and Cat Rock. Got to this campsite before 5 pm. Small crowd so far. Big crowd of mosquitoes. Wreck looked down at his leg while at spring getting water and counted 12 mosquitoes on them. We’ve deeted up and they’re keeping their distance so far.

Small falls but very picturesque and great tasting water. From the falls, even though it was Fathers Day we had a lot of “Mom basha “ going on. Went over Mombasha High Point, past Mombasha Lake and crossed both East and West Mombasha roads today. Of special note, there was trail magic in the form of drinking water at 5 different road crossings today. Thanks so much!!!!!  Weather was hot!  Sunny and high around 90. Still, in the shade which we were much of the day it was bearable.  Hiked past a number a pretty ponds today.  Ran into quite a lot of long distance hikers today - over a dozen? - and maybe because of the weather but most folks didn’t seem to be having much fun. Since Wreck really likes southern New York, he finds this somewhat disappointing. Did a lot of lollygagging this afternoon, got to this site about 6 pm and Brighty was finished for the day.

Woke up this morning and we could tell it was going to be a hot one. At 7 am it was pleasant going over the open rock outcrops, by 9 am it was pretty warm, by 10 am it was oven like and stayed that way much of the day ( Temp in mid 90’s) . The saving grace was wind and shade and today we needed both. Luckily we had a fair amount of both. First thing this morning we squeezed thru the Lemon Squeezer, a short but really narrow path between two rock walls. Wreck had to take his pack off and carry it in front of him. Brighty managed with pack on. Right after the Lemon Squeezer is The Wall (okay that’s what we named it), a 10 ft rock wall that’s about the hardest climb on the AT. Wreck did it in 2015 and thought “that’s crazy”. Then he found out there was a bypass trail. Oh. Naturally he had to do it again this year. Went right instead of left this time. That was slightly better. Going left IS crazy.  Much of the day was walking in Harriman State Park and much of the day we walked through a savanna type setting. Large trees with some space between them and a grass/sedge ground covering. No understory. We can’t figure out how it maintains itself. Lots of tree seedlings around but no small trees. We’ll investigate. Tons of blueberries especially on the outcrops (ripe next month). Actually we haven’t had a day since Delaware Water Gap that we haven’t had lots of blueberries.  Wreck saw a pileated woodpecker this morning and a large turkey this afternoon. Had two draining climbs late this afternoon up Black and West Mountains and an exciting crossing of the Palisades Parkway (wow - lots of fast traffic). We took a blue blazed trail 0.6 m across West Mountain to this shelter.  Has view of NYC skyline in good weather. Got here with thunder in the distance. Able to set up tent and cook supper before it hit. Had to eat in the tent and found out this tent spot (looks like the most used around) doesn’t drain well. By the time the rain stopped our tent was in the middle of a lake. Finished supper and changed locations. Hopefully a better draining area.

Not sure where they were but they outshined Manhattan. Another storm rolled in last night. Our second tenting area drained much better. A slower start this morning but we had a shorter day planned. Back across West Mountain before 9am to the AT and then down West Mountain and up and down Bear Mountain. Weather slightly cooler today (mid 80’s). A constant theme all day today was small arms firing and much larger explosions. At first we thought the explosions were thunder (and, in fairness the weather did cloud up for awhile). Wreck twice checked the radar on his phone. No storms around. The second time he checked he noticed we were just down the Hudson from West Point and the US Military owns a large chunk of land south of West Point and adjunct to Bear Mountain. Thought the explosions had stopped for the day around noon but they must have been just taking a lunch break as it started up again this afternoon. We’re guessing summer training for the cadets (or we’re getting ready to invade Canada!). stopped at the top of Bear Mountain and climbed the Perkins Tower (stone tower), named after George Perkins, visionary for this park back in the early 1900’s. (The state of New York had actually started building an addition to Sing Sing prison in this area before Perkins and others stepped in.) The trail up and especially down Bear Mountain is probably the most engineered along the whole AT. Over 1,000 stone steps just on the way down. Wow! (And they’re proud of it too. Over a dozen signs at the bottom about the trail construction). Beautiful large rounded rocks all over Bear Mountain also. Very nice.  Got to Bear Mountain Inn early this afternoon. We’re staying at one of the stone cottages. The main inn is a beautiful stone and wood structure, not unlike the lodges found in some National Park areas. When Wreck went by this area in 2015, he thought that Brighty would love it. Brighty loves it and her feet have asked for a “zero” day tomorrow so we’ll stay an extra night and explore. Although the Inn is really nice, we’ve noticed that not a lot of people are staying here. Ate dinner (off kind of a lunch menu) tonight and only three other tables with people eating (and it’s a huge dining room). Oh well, we’re back in the cabin.

Weather was great, path was paved, breakfast proved to be very nice. Afterwards, Brighty treated herself to a massage, Wreck wondered around the lake, we met up for lunch, then unboxed and packed our food box (Brighty was unsupervised while packing our food shipment and slipped in a 2 lb bag of gory / we will probably leave much of it here). The excitement of the day was probably Wreck going to get dinner. After last night at the Inn, he was in the mood for something else and found Barnstormer Barbeque 1.6m away. Barbeque sounded good to both of us so Wreck volunteered go get it. Unfortunately he didn’t check the map and hiked about 0.8m down the wrong road before recognizing his error so the original 3.2m round trip became a nearly 5m hike. Good barbecue chicken though.

Then it was time to hit the trail.  The trail goes right through the Bear Mountain Zoo so we saw a bear!!! And a rattlesnake!!!! And a red fox!!!! (Okay, enough of that!). The zoo is quite small and most of the animals are in small cages. We think they are trying to improve things but, of course, that takes $$$. After the zoo we crossed the Hudson on the Bear Mountain bridge, largest suspension bridge in country when it was built. Once on the east/north side of the Hudson the trail heads up the ridge, only 500 ft up but, it sure seemed more (steep!).  The rest of the day was a walk in the woods. The AT on this side of the Hudson lacks the rock outcrops and views that the trail has on the other side of the river.  Stopped at the Appalachian Market for Gatorades (but no supplies as both our packs are seemingly stuffed with food items - although we know in 4-5 days we’ll be rationing our food worried about running out before he next town.) We’re camped on the ball field of a Franciscan  monastery. They’ve been providing this “magic” for hikers for many years. There’s a covered pavilion, picnic tables, water ( including a cold shower) and privies. What more could you need. In 2015 when Wreck was here there must have been 50 tents.

Early on the trail was on a narrow AT corridor - several road crossings, disturbed forest with lots of poison ivy and TONS of garlic mustard. This afternoon we hiked through Clarence Fahnestock State Park. Nicer woods. Had a short section where we crossed a low area on a 8-10’ raised trail (beautiful rock retaining wall). Wow!  That took some work.  Lots of stone today - including stone walls (we must be getting close to Robert Frost country). Went by one stone remains of a farmhouse and barn which served as a smallpox inoculation center for Washington’s army during the revolutionary war. No real mountains to climb today (and for that matter for the next couple of weeks) but some steep ups and downs and, again to emphasize, lots of rocks to negotiate. Enough for Brighty’s feet to tell her to slow down and so we did.  Never did find a long stretch where we could make good time and so it was about 7:00pm before we reached this campsite. The State Park lets AT hikers camp in a big field about 0.2m from the sandy beach at the lake.

A check of the weather showed that the 90% that had been predicted all week for today had dropped to 50%. Later it dropped to 20% and we still haven’t had any. (Now they’re predicting tomorrow). Lots of rocks today but, thankfully, most of them were NOT on the trail. Indeed the trail was very good the whole day. Climbed away from the lake and up Shenandoah Mountain this morning where we picked our first ripe blueberries!  All three of them. Small but a reminder of things to come?  We hope so!  After lunch we stopped at the RPH (Ralph’s Peak Hiker) shelter. We thought it must be special as it has an entire organization supporting it (RPH Cabin Volunteers Club). It was!  Bunk beds, nice benches, good collection of books and two great chaise lounges outside. Very comfortable. Brighty could have stayed longer but there were miles to hike. The last couple days we’ve noticed a lot of recent (Spring) blowdowns along the trail, almost all of which have already been cleared. Well, the epicenter, so far, of the damage was from RPH shelter up Hosner Mountain. Wow!  Well over a hundred blowdowns (not all across the trail). Big trees - many of which were uprooted and knocked down. Brighty thinks it looked like a bomb had gone off (although after further consideration, we think a major wind event was probably the culprit ). Again, just about all blowdowns across trail had already been cleared. WOW!  That took a lot of time. Thanks so much for the great work!  Coming down Hosner Mountain, Brighty’s feet started to protest but there was one more mountain to climb so up and over Storyville Mountain we went.

Forecast was for rain to possibly start around noon. Later that was pushed back to 2, then 4:15pm. It actually started around 3:30 pm. Light at first and then a pretty solid rain. Luckily, the trail had been so good that we reached this shelter before 5 pm - just before a really hard downpour started. We got to watch it from inside the shelter!  Really poor campsites around shelter so we’re going to chance the mosquitoes aren’t bad and sleep in the shelter - with Deet nearby.  Almost all day we hiked through land purchased specifically to establish a permanent corridor for the trail. Sometimes it was over 0.5m wide, other times only 0.1m wide. Mostly nice woods, a couple small views. This afternoon we skirted around Nuclear Lake, which according to a local Hiker we asked was named due to some 1950’s nuclear processing facility there. Evidently they was a costly cleanup associated with the facility. Looked nice now and there were a few folks floating on the water so we guess all is good. We were even thinking of dipping our feet in but that’s when the rain started. We’re tucked in our bags now and the thunder has started. Looks like another line of storms are headed our way. We thinking/ hoping the shelter was a pretty good idea.","NY52 Stormville

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595322,"It rained several times last night. That combined with the fact that we heard only a couple mosquitoes all night convinced us that we had made a good decision to stay in the shelter. Plus we had a nice talk with one of our fellow shelter mates - a young thruhiker from Grundy High School and UVA ( we asked him how he liked UMBC!). Up to a beautiful blue sky.  We had a short day planned today so didn’t hurry. Ambled down the trail and across a nice boardwalk over another beautiful marsh  (Did we mention Brighty loves boardwalks over marshes?) Went by the biggest tree along the AT, huge oak right next to the highway going into Pawling, NY.  Got to Native Landscaping a little after 10 am and waited for Roseann’s food truck to open (at 11 am). Ate lunch (great milk shakes) and ambled some more. This afternoon the trail went through the Pawling Nature Preserve, a Nature Conservancy area.  With several breaks, got to this shelter before 5 pm. We found a nice tent site and are fed and content. Weather forecast is for lows in the 40’s tonight. We’re breaking out all the clothes we have just in case and Brighty’s space blanket is expected to be deployed. For now, it’s a beautiful evening with lots a big trees around. Life is good!","Telephone Pioneers shelter

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595457,"Just a great day today. Temperature dropped into the 40’s last night but we both had enough clothes on that our summer bags kept us warm (plus Brighty’s “space” blanket). Woke up to bright blue skies and so it was all day. Went into Connecticut earlier in the day and - so far- we love it! (Interestingly, this was Wreck’s least favorite state in 2015). Climbed 10 Mile Hill and talked with a very nice family out for a day hike. (They had visited lots of National Parks so there was a lot to talk about). Down from the Hill we crossed 10 Mile River just above it’s confluence with the Housatonic River.  Next mile or so was a beautiful walk along the “ Hooz”. Great diverse flora on steep hillside by river, especially great ferns (huge maidenhair ferns). We found a path down to a sandy beach (surrounded by Equisetum) and had a first lunch and swim (Wreck only). He says “very refreshing”. Awhile later we walked upon some great trail magic provided by PigPen and friends ( PigPen hiked much of the trail in 2017). Hot dogs, chips, drinks, great brownies, fresh strawberries. Wow!  And great conservation too!. Thanks PigPen!!!!!  Walked 0.2m off trail down road to see 1842 covered bridge over the Hooz. Very picturesque. The rest of the afternoon we climbed this mountain (with several nice views) and pulled into camp after 6 pm. Beautiful campsite, mosquitoes near Deet level. We’re tucked away in the tent, the sun has set and the slow train to Maine is shutting down for the night.","Wiley shelter

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595553,"Had a bard owl serenade us last night. This was a really nice campsite. Pretty 35’ or so cliff right behind us. We had a short (even for us) day planned today.  Our clothes hadn’t seen a washing machine in 19 days!  It was time. So we hiked over Mt Algo, a rockier climb than Brighty was expecting and down to Schaghticoke Rd which we walked into the small town of Kent, CT. Like many Connecticut towns, Kent is pretty and pricey. It’s seems like a great town ( most folks very friendly) but you just got the impression that it doesn’t understand the hiking community and it’s needs nor really need the hiker’s influx of cash. It’s would do fine without them. Just a feeling we had. (We searched the pharmacy, food store and “outfitter” for a small bottle of hand sanitizers day travel size toothpaste  with no success.) We did have success finding a great lunch at JP Gifford’s, got some insoles for Brighty’ shoes, resupplied food at the IGA ( again, no hand sanitizer or toothpaste) and did wash at the laundromat. The owner of the laundry doesn’t exactly like hikers (in fact, she pretty much banned them from coming for years). Her son and daughter-in-law have softened her up - but just a little.  Let’s just say she tolerates them - at least enough for us to wash our clothes. Then it was back to JP Giffords to get some “dinner to go” and afterwards we got picked up by the folks at Cooper Creek where we’re spending the night. Comfortable room, it’s raining outside and suppose to do so much of the night so we’re content. Not so content with idea that rain is suppose to continue much of tomorrow but that’s for another day. Besides “no rain, no Maine” as the saying goes.","Schaghticoke Mountain campsite

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595712,"There was quite a lot of rain last night - as we were snug in our bed at the Cooper Creek B&B. We got lucky. Up for breakfast, some conversation with the owners and back to the trailhead by 9:30 am, just as the rains transitioned from steady to light.  Up, up out of Kent we went. The wet conditions had the red spotted newts on the move today. We saw nearly 20 this morning. Rain alternated between light and none on the way up to Caleb’s Peak. We heard from a day hiker that there were great views up there if clear. Cloudy today. A little later we had lunch overlooking the Housatonic valley from St John’s Ledges. Nice views there. Some rumbles of thunder ended lunch and we headed down a really steep section of trail to the river. The rocks were wet so it was especially slow going. Brighty fell once. Luckily backwards and by the time Wreck could turn to see what happened it looked like she was just sitting on a rock (which, we guess, she was). No harm so we continued down even slower. Got down to the river before the rains started. Had a couple periods of good rain this afternoon. Luckily, once down from the ledges, the trail runs flat right along the Housatonic for five miles - very scenic - so the rain actually were nice - cooling us off. The last mile today was uphill to this campsite. Nice site. Three young folks “zeroed” here today and said they saw a bear on the bear box last night. We shall see if it returns tonight - or if we can stay awake long enough to see it!  Right now, we’re fed, life is good and the slow train to Maine is shutting down for the night.","Kent CT

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595749,"Woke up and it felt like a hot day - it was. We were the last folks leaving camp - 7:30am. The young thruhikers who zeroed here yesterday had big mileage plans for today (first one left at 5 am). Due to the recent rains Guinea Brook was running high. The usual rock hop was submerged so we changed into our crocs and waded across (only mid calf at deepest point). It was refreshing on a day where we needed refreshing. Lots of ups and downs today - sort of like the rollercoaster in VA - and many of the hills were quite steep. On the plus side we went through some real nice woods. In areas facing east and north lots of trillium, Solomon seal, maidenhair ferns and tons more. Nothing blooming but it was still nice. Wreck loved it. Quite a lot of small chestnut trees along the drier areas. We knew we started slow but thought we were making good time until we realized we had covered the first four miles in four hours! It was just one of those days. Had fun going through Connecticut’s version of the Lemon Squeezer (Brighty thought it was maybe a grapefruit squeezer). Got to this campsite about 7 pm. That’s a long day. High temperature was close to 90 degrees. As usual, wind and shade were our saving graces. Suppose to go down to low 60’s tonight. That sounds great to us. It’s still pretty hot right now. We’re bushed and shutting down for the night.  Northward Ho!!!!   -  tomorrow.","Silver Hill campsite

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595878,"Well, as predicted, it did cool off nicely last night. We slept well. Today was a “town day” which always puts a spring to your step - although another really hot day may have knocked the spring down a notch or two.  More 90 degree weather.  Trail came down to the Housatonic this morning. We had a four mile stretch running near the river. The section coming into Falls Village was especially nice complete with lots of benches!  Just above Falls Village the Hooz goes over an outstanding falls. Wow!  That was quite a sight.  Afterwards we climbed Mt Prospect (at 1475 ft the high point for today). Had lunch on top and dropped down eventually to the road that led us into Salisbury, Ct, another super nice, pricey Connecticut town (Meryl Streep has a residence nearby). We’re not staying with Meryl but with Vanessa Breton who rents out rooms in her house to hikers. Got in, showered, ate at the nearby restaurant and - with the temperature predicted to reach 96 tomorrow- we’ll “zero” in town and head out and into Massachusetts on Monday. For now, these comfortable beds are calling - although no air conditioning here so it may be a little warmer than if we were sleeping outside.","Belters campsite

We slept fair last night. Went to breakfast in air conditioned restaurant this morning, resupplied at small but nice market here in Salisbury, repacked our packs, had an ice cream cone and contemplated what to do this afternoon with the heat index at 110 degrees. Luckily the Salisbury library, one of the most picturesque libraries around and with some of the most comfortable chairs anywhere and with great air conditioning was open on Sunday afternoon. It was an easy decision. Spent a relaxing afternoon catching up on the news (we didn’t realize we’re actually hiking the “Tallahassee Trail” - but it sure felt like Florida weather), and snoozing on those comfortable chairs. Now we’ve eaten dinner, talked with “the kids” and - at least outside - is starting to cool off a little. Looking for a early start tomorrow (although Brighty is looking at a morning coffee at a shop that doesn’t open until 7 am so we shall see). Suppose to be even hotter tomorrow so we’re looking forward to those swimming holes in Sages Ravine. Massachusetts here we come!!!","Salisbury, CT

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596054,"What do you do when the heat index is 110?  Find a good swimming hole!!!!  That’s what we did - but first we had to get there. Last night in Vanessa’s house was another hot one. Think it was probably mid eighties until well after midnight. Brighty needed a croissant and coffee this morning so it wasn’t until 7:30 am before we left Salisbury. It was already heating up.  Luckily there were a lot a small creeks early on so we drank, drank, drank. There were sections today where we had a little wind. They were fine. There were sections today that we had no wind. They were stifling. We were both sweating up a storm climbing Lions Head, the first climb of the day. Climbing Bear Mountain, the second climb of the day, was really tough. No wind AND no shade for long sections. It was oven like. Got to the top, found both some wind and shade and had lunch. Feeling a little better we headed down the other side of the mountain. Really rocky, really steep. We were really slow. Soon we had left Connecticut behind and entered Massachusetts. Yahoo!  The first bit of trail in Massachusetts goes through Sages Ravine. Great place. Trail runs along nice stream with lots of -,you guessed it - swimming holes. Just what we needed. Brighty soaked her feet while Wreck took the whole body plunge. Nothing better on the hot summer day. We felt like new people. We linger there for awhile but finally pushed on to this campsite. Mosquitoes bad at first but we’re packing Deet and we know how to use it!  It’s kept them at bay. Right now it’s cooled off nicely. Not cool mind you but pleasant (we’re over 1,600 ft so that might help a little). We hoping for the first good nights sleep in awhile.

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596146,"Another hot day . . . another fine swimming hole. We both slept really good last night. It was kind of warm in the tent at first (but nothing like our nights in town). Cooled off enough for sound sleeping. By the time we got up (6:30am) it was already feeling like a warm day ahead. Today we had a choice. In Massachusetts they want you camping only in designated areas. So we could hike 5 miles or 19.3 miles. Since 19.3 miles with a heat index of over 100 wasn’t going to happen we knew we had time to lollygag.  First climb of the day was up Mt Race. We’d like to say we raced up Race but it was more like plodding up Race. Great long stretch of views on top (hazy views but nice). Picked a couple handful of blueberries - just starting to ripen, and then plodded down. Despite the hot weather quite a few folks out on trail - thruhikers, dayhikers, an adventure camp group (probably close to 30 total). Most in good spirits despite the heat. Took a break between Mt Race and Mt Everett for an early lunch and then tackled the latter. Steep climb in the heat. We took several breaks before reaching the top. No pool with water slide on top so we headed down. Downhill was great (ie easy). Got to the Guilder Pond picnic area and ran into great trail magic (lots of Gatorade). Sitting around with several thruhikers enjoying the magic and the magic providers drove up (with more Gatorade). They had time, we had time so we had great conservation. Thanks so much!  One thing we learned was Guilder Pond had a great rock along the shore that provided access into the pond for swimmers. We had the time so off we went. Found the rock (only a couple people there - they said on weekends it was packed), and into the water we went. It was a testament to how warm the pond was that both Wreck AND Brighty went in. Very nice. Chatted
with the other couple for awhile (we had time) and ambled over to this campsite. Seems like a very nice site. Lots of pretty healthy looking hemlock although the adelgid is suppose to be around. Really nice to see big hemlocks!  Weather has cooled off nicely and, unlike last night, mosquitoes appear to be at a minimum. Got a lot bigger mileage day planned for tomorrow so we’re going to try and hit the hay a little early even for us!!!  All goes well.","Laurel Ridge campsite

Bigger mileage day and trying to avoid the heat. First couple miles were pleasant. Blueberries slowly ripening. We probably had 7-10 handfuls today (Wreck picking and eating 90% of the total). After going across Mt Bushnell and Jug End early in the day we dropped into the lowlands. Six flat, buggy miles. Wreck was on poison ivy high alert much of the time. We made okay time but not a section you’d recommend to someone who was just looking for an AT section to hike. We did go by the site of the last battle of Shays Rebellion, 1787. Interesting to think that for six years after the Revolutionary War ended we had no president! Water sources along trail were really bad. Still boggy stuff. Got to US7 in bad need of water and the great folks at a garden center near the trail let us fill up there. That was really appreciated!!!  Climbed both June and East Mountains towards days end. Brighty gamely plugged over them (both steep in sections) but by the time we reached this shelter site her body said “enough”. We’re on a platform (got  rope in Kent so Tarptent  does pretty well in “freestanding” mode). Mosquitoes bad. Deet has been deployed. All chores are done (water was 1/4 mile DOWN steep hill) and we’re hearing fireworks in the distance. It sprinkled a little during dinner but hasn’t cooled off yet.

Cooled off a little as the night went on but the first couple hours after dark were STUFFY!  Still we slept okay and we were back on the trail by 7:15am.  Nice trail today. (Despite this, Wreck managed to stumble and crash crossing a boardwalk. Cut to scalp but got to wear super cool Dearth Vader bandaid). No long grinding uphills but definitely a  more mountainous feel than Connecticut, even though we barely got over 2,000 ft all day. Nice large rocks, cliffs, had nice first lunch from the Ledges (good view, nice breeze). Passed a couple pretty ponds too - one curtesy of an industrious beaver. Despite the temperature last night, today wasn’t nearly as hot as the previous bunch. We think it got to mid 80’s with some clouds and - sometimes - nice breeze. The forest is definitely changing as we get further into New England. Lots of conifers (white and pitch pines and tons of hemlock). We’ve got our fingers crossed about the hemlock adelgid. That would be an ecological disaster - of course, the mid-Atlantic and southeast states have already experienced such as disaster. Hobble Bush is on the increase, as is paper birch, saw some Clintonia (Blue beaded lily) today (with still green berries). Partridgeberry and wood sorrel both in bloom. Well . . . . after a long downhill, we (ie Brighty) were excited to be getting close to our campsite only to learn at a road crossing 0.3m away from the site and at 6 pm that the campsite had been closed yesterday due to recent bear activity. The next camping area was nearly 10 miles away. No way we could make that so we could either hike a few miles more and hopefully found a spot to “stealth camp” or take our chances with the bear. Since a couple miles would still be in the bears range and this site had a bear box we opted for the latter. We’ve eaten, carefully put all ”smellables” (except ourselves!!!) in the bear box and are turning in for the night. No sign of Mrs Bear yet (reportedly with three cubs).   Storms predicted overnight into morning so we’re anticipating a wet start - but this hot spell is supposed to break for at least a little while so we’ll take it!!!  All is good and the slow train to Maine is shutting down for the night.","Tom Leonard shelter

Brighty really struggling early on. We stopped on top of Cobble Hill for a break and she broke out the peanut butter and Wasa crackers plus some electrolyte drink. That did the trick. Feeling much better and we both felt even better coming down to MA23 and seeing a sign for the “Hiker Shack”. A couple sodas and chips later and life was good. Rain started as we got back on the trail. Light to moderate rain for the next several hours. After the heat of the last few days, the rain felt great. We needed a shower!  Rain had the red spotted newts on the move again. We saw at least 50 on the trail today. Baldy Mountain was the only other climb of the day. Rest of trail was quite gentle. We did notice some hemlock adelgid eggs on some of the hemlocks today so that’s not good news for the future. Got to Upper Goose Pond cabin about 2:30pm. It’s owned by the ATC and managed by the local trail club, Berkshire chapter of the AMC. Nice place on the “pond” (which us Virginians would call a lake). We took the canoe out this afternoon for an hour paddle then went for a swim (Wreck) foot dipping (Brighty) from the dock. Nice crowd of folks here tonight.

A great change from our usual breakfast bars!  Upper Goose is a great AT place. We really enjoyed it. Weather fantastic today. Low humidity and temperatures in the low 70’s.  Made hiking really enjoyable. Trail was pretty tame today. Over a couple “mountains” (in name only). Went by some beautiful ponds - one, Finerty Pond, a beautiful blue looking more like a lake to us Virginians. Several other smaller ponds and wetlands were also nice. Had great conversation with SawDog, the AT ridge runner for this area. He also volunteers to work on trails at Baxter State Park and knows our good friend Pothole. Shortly later we pulled into the Cookie Lady’s house, right off the trail. She is an AT legend providing cookies and encouragement to hikers for many years. Both she and her husband - the Cookie Man - are getting up there in years and it’s getting harder for them to maintain things. SawDog said the AT family has been helping them out and we wanted to be a part of that.  After nice talk with the Cookie Lady (a fun person) Wreck spent a couple hours mowing the lawn, around the barn and blueberry bushes.

Really one of the highlights of our AT journey.  A couple minor hills to climb today but otherwise one of the tamer days we’ve had. South of Warner Hill we went through a forest of dying spruce trees. Not sure the cause (could be several) but they’re going to have a bunch of blowdowns over the years.  On Warner Hill itself the blueberry bushes were packed with blueberries. A week or two more and some hikers are going to be in for a treat!!!  Much of the rest of the day was a nice walk in the woods.

When we first started planning this adventure, Brighty expressed a strong desire to spend a night at the lodge on top of Mt Graylock. It’s 17.2 miles from Dalton (not a distance the slow train to Maine attempts in a day) so we have two days to get there. Much of the trail today was gradually uphill. A little more wind and cooler temperatures at elevation so hiking was nice. Went by beautiful Gore Pond. Stopped (because we had time) and watch a blue heron  fishing in the pond. Had a late lunch (after our big breakfast we weren’t  very hungry) on top of the Cobbles with great views of the Hoosic River Valley, town of Cheshire, and Mt Greylock. Trail then dropped down into Cheshire. Stopped at ice cream store right next to trail and then came up to the local Catholic Church which lets hikers camp on the side lawn. Set up the tent and walked the bike trail about a mile to the Basswater Grill for dinner. Not a great meal but much better than the Knorr Sides we had in our pack. We’re back at the church.

Lacking in a lot of little areas. Anyhoot, stopped up at the Tower again and then headed down the mountain. Great walking in the higher elevations through the spruce fir forest (last time the AT went through a spruce fir forest was down on Mt Rogers in Virginia).  Trail was steep for the first half of the descent and then we hit some great rock steps and switchbacks.

Deep blue skies without a cloud in sight. What a greeting!  For the first 100+ miles in Vermont, the AT and the Long Trail are together. After that the Long Trail (which predates the AT by several decades) continues north for another almost 200 miles to the Canadian border while the AT heads east to New Hampshire.

Great weather today again. Stopped on Harmon Hill to call and arrange a ride from the trailhead and pick a few ripening red raspberries. Then it was a steep couple miles downhill to the gap. Lots and lots of rock steps - not all in the best of condition. Got picked up by the owner of the Catamount Motel. Simple but nice. We both had salads for lunch at Cilantros and Wreck caught the great public transportation to Walmart/Pricechopper to resupply. Brighty took a short nap and woke up feeling poorly. Not sure if it was the changing weather, the overripe avocado in the salad, or the accumulation of trail days but the rest of the day she felt rotten.  Did go out to dinner with Wreck but ate maybe one wing - too bad as we both had been looking forward to this place - Madison Brewing Company - for a couple days. Lots of interesting menu items plus interesting beers. Wreck had an imperial double IPA and also Brighty’s Creamsicle double IPA. Both good. We both would have tried the blueberry wheat beer if Brighty hadn’t been so under the weather. Managed to walk back to the hotel room. Not sure about tomorrow. We think 50/50 between hiking north or taking a zero and hoping Brighty can regain her health.  For now it’s bed for both of us.","Congdon shelter

Had breakfast nearby at Friendly and she was up to 80%.  Decided to head north. Got a shuttle and we were back at the Gap a little before 10 am. A haul right away out of the gap. We went slow and Brighty seemed to stay about 80% which was pretty good considering it was up 1,300 ft right away. Trail became much tamer (more Vermonty says Wreck) but we still climbed another 1,000+ feet to get to this site. Brighty has continued to improve. Still doesn’t have her appetite back but much much better than last night (think we’ll have to stay away from towns!!!!). Lots of people on the trail today (There’s a popular 21 mile loop trail that includes this section of AT and since it’s a Saturday lots of traffic). Lots of dogs on the trail too. One, Amber, we played leap frog with all day. She barked at us each time but she’s a cutie. We’re up above 3,500 ft tonight. The storms expected this afternoon never materialized. Maybe tonight?  We’ve battened down the hatches just in case. Tomorrow we head north again. Looking forward to it!!!","Bennington VT

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597293,"Well, we had an interesting day today. Didn’t rain or get too cold last night. First order of business today was to hike 0.3m north and climb the Glastenbury Mountain lookout tower. Spectacular views when clear. Alas we were in the clouds this morning. Views of the treetops below but little else. The rest of the day the trail was pretty tame - just a couple uphill sections. Not as much traffic on the trail today but quality made up for quantity. This morning while hiking at our usual slow pace we heard footsteps behind us (a typical occurrence). Moved to the side of the trail to let the hiker by and as we turned and said “hi” we became aware that this backpacker was wearing no clothes. Shortly later we were passed by his hiking partner also wearing no clothes. Both hikers are we’re guessing in their mid 60’s. We leapfrogged them multiple times today. Their pace and Brighty’s pace is similar. Evidently Vermont has no laws against nudity (when hiking?) and they are “nudist” (though we think part-time not full-time). They are section hiking the Long Trail. They actually seem like nice, normal folks and like to talk (which Wreck finds challenging though he tries - Brighty says the key is to maintain eye contact!). Anyhoot it’s been interesting. They are staying in this shelter, we’re camped a respectable distance away (although we’d love to see the reaction of other hikers as they pull in). Mosquitoes are actually pretty bad here so they might be covering up soon. Weather humid today but no rain. It’s coming in next day or definitely two. We’re going to try to hike a few extra miles tomorrow. Brighty feeling pretty much back to normal.","Goddard shelter

We started on the trail early today. Weather was warm last night and humid today though sunny. After an initial uphill, the trail was mostly downhill for the first four miles. Vermont trails have a reputation for being really muddy (hence the nickname Vermud). We’re in a really dry time up here and still some sections today were pretty muddy.  It looked like - with rain - you might lose a boot in some in it.   After the downhill we then climbed Stratton Mountain (3936 ft). It’s a very well graded climb both up and down. Lookout tower on top with good but summer hazy views. Saw our next mountain - Bromley - to the north. Had great conversation with Jean, the caretaker on top of the mountain. 5 days/week for 5 months/ year she and her husband live in a tiny hut on top the mountain. Been doing it for nearly 50 years!!!  Wow. Does she have some stories. We think she should write a book. Miles to go before we stop so we bid Jean farewell and headed down mountain. Went by beautiful Stratton Pond- these ponds up here are fantastic!  Got to this campsite on the north side of the river about 6 pm. Cooked, filtered water, got the best bags up, etc, etc with a little rumble of thunder in the distance. Finished all the chores, got in the tent and the rain started. There’s some thunder still going on and a moderate rain coming down. Like we said, they really need it so that’s good. Tomorrow could be nasty - there’s talk of high winds and hail.

About 9am things got dark (after twilight dark) and the bottom dropped out. The AT became the Appalachian Stream or Pool. Luckily the really hard rain only lasted maybe an hour. The rest of the morning was just drizzle. Had an early lunch at the Spruce Peak shelter with a nice overhanging front porch which was especially nice since the rains started to pick up. Got out to the highway about 2pm, stuck out our thumbs and the second vehicle stopped and picked us up. Great lady (who didn’t mind wet hikers) took us into the Pricechopper so we could resupply. The folks at Green Mountain hostel picked us up there. This is a super nice hostel (really like a b&b). We showered, washed clothes and cooked dinner (chicken, corn on the cob and sweet potatoes). They had pints of Ben And Jerry’s ice cream for one dollar!!! We split one. Nice conversation with some other hikers staying here. Now we are bushed.

We totally agree.  Can’t think of a more comfortable hostel on the AT. Jeff, the owner, was gone for a couple days but Duffy was super. Duffy has an interesting life. Since he retired he and his little camper have gone up and down the AT working at different hostels from Georgia to Maine. He really likes it in Vermont and, again, was a great host to us. After we fixed eggs and blueberry pancakes for breakfast, Duffy had us back to the trail before 9am. A fantastic weather day. Deep blue skies, low humidity and near 70 degrees. Not a day us Virginians are accustomed to in July!  It was a day to go hiking in the mountains so that’s what we did. Climbed  Bromley Mountain (3260 ft) this morning. The last maybe 0.2m of trail to the  top follow a downhill ski run. On top of the mountain was a chairlift (not operating in the summer) and a warming hut (open for camping in summer). An interesting observation was the difference that us Virginians and Vermont folks rate their ski slopes. As we walked up the one the trail followed we thought “wow this must be one of the most difficult slopes”. Once on top we noticed the sign saying “easiest way down” and pointing to where we had just come from. Don’t think us bunny slopers will be doing much skiing in Vermont!  Had lunch on the sunny deck of the warming hut. Talked with a southbound flip flopper from Brunswick, Md. (it’s a small world - last night at the hostel was a young SOBO from Purcellville, VA and another young man whose parents lived at Smith Mountain Lake  - near where we used to live in Franklin County VA).  Leaving Bromley it was down to Mad Tom Notch - gotta love that name!  Just after starting our descent of Bromley we observed a red spotted newt climbing up the trail toward the top. We don’t think there was any permanent water within a mile which made us marvel at the distance these newts can travel from one watering hole to the next (also made us think twice about complaining  in the future about any of these climbs. That was one tough newt!  From Mad Tom we climbed Styles Peak (3394ft with view) and Peru Peak (3429ft without view). Then down to this campsite on Griffin Lake (very pretty body of water). There’s a summer caretaker at this site - very nice former thruhiker from Baltimore. It’s supposed to be near 40 degrees or below. We’ve got every piece of clothing in our packs on or close by.

As a result Brighty had liner, space blanket and fleece on, Wreck had fleece and broke out his rain gear after midnight and put them on. We bunched together and were okay but hopefully that was the coldest night - until we get our cold weather stuff in Hanover. Due to the cold we were a little late getting started today (Brighty announced she wasn’t getting up until the sun was hitting our tent). Went over Mt Baker this morning. Rocky summit had Brighty thinking about the Whites (and not in a good way). Still the weather produced another fantastic day and the view was outstanding. We lagged on top of Baker for quite awhile soaking up the sun. Then dropped gently down all the way to the gavel road going to Darby VT. We stopped at Big Branch for some snacks and just to enjoy this beautiful weather. At the Darby Rd we ran into great trail magic - hot dogs, chips, sodas, fruit - provided by two guys - one from New York, one from Bennington who met, hit it off and just like to spend a couple days each summer helping hikers out. Super guys, super magic. To top it off Onesimus, the one who ran in 36 ice cream sandwiches to Upper Goose awhile ago was also there handing out . . . . Ice cream sandwiches. Thanks to all. It was magic. Got to this campsite by another beautiful pond and were so full we both decided we didn’t want any food. Watched the sun set by the pond talking with a southbound German man who has lived the last 25 years in China. Very interesting. Also chatted with caretaker and Late Start by the pond. We’re been seeing Late Start off and on for a couple weeks now. Indeed a number of hikers seem to be on the current pace of “the slow train to Maine” (us).  Not sure why - we certainly aren’t picking up our pace.

Up a little bit earlier this morning with Brighty on the trail before 8am (while Wreck finished his breakfast on the “beach” by the pond).  Weather again nice - a little more humid than the last couple but still a great blue Vermont sky. Up over a couple smallish mountains today. Great views from White Rocks Cliff (0.2m off trail). Folks told us there were peregrine falcons nesting in the cliff but we didn’t see them. About 0.5m north of Greenwall shelter we somehow missed the small sign indicating the AT went right. Instead we sailed down a nice downhill trail into a picnic area totally unaware we were off trail. Brighty went to use the facilities and Wreck sat down on a table. Only after checking AWOL, the map on the bulletin board and his ATC app did Wreck realize our mistake. Luckily we had only gone 0.4m but, of course, now we had to go another 0.4m UP the trail back to the AT.  Went over great suspension bridge over Clarendon Gorge late in the day. Wreck was tempted by the swimming holes but it was 6pm with miles to go.  Big rock scramble out of the Gorge reminded us -a little - of Mahoosic Notch in Maine. Temperature was a good 10-15 degrees cooler climbing (due to a lot of underground vents under the rocks). Got to this campsite after 7pm. Had the rest of our cheese and beef stick to celebrate (plus fettuccine Alfredo). Now it’s time for bed. Doesn’t seem nearly as cool tonight.  Sounds good to us!!!","Little Rock Pond

We’re going to try and avoid shelter areas in the future. Another beautiful weather day today. Wow!  It’s been a great stretch but looks like the weather pattern is changing overnight. Trail started out this morning straight up a little grinder of the hill. Seems like the bigger the mountain the better the trail grade but these little one are super steep. Anyhoot the big climb of the day was up Killington. Wreck had been telling Brighty for awhile that this was a smooth climb.  Well, the trail’s grade was pretty good (lots of sidehill construction) but lots of rocks and especially roots in the trail. That and the fact that it was fairly narrow with a steep drop off on one side made Brighty not enjoy it too much (and lower Wreck’s credibility even more). Once we got past the Shrewsbury Peak trail intersection about 3/4 of the way up the trail leveled out so even Brighty couldn’t complain. Got up to this shelter about 6pm and took the 0.2m side trail up to Killington Peak. Fantastic views!!!!  Maybe the best in Vermont along the AT. We’re staying in the shelter which is an old enclosed one. Windows out so wind in. We’re close to 4,000 ft in elevation but temperature suppose to stay in 40’s (we hope).

After 9pm, we were just dozing off, when the door to the shelter opened and in came two somewhat disheveled young women. They said they had driven up to Vermont today from Virginia and were planning on camping on the peak of Killington. One had a big backpack, one had a daypack and they were carrying a rather large Coleman tent like you see at Walmart. We told them they were better staying in here. They readily agreed. Didn’t sleep all that good. The bunks weren’t level and we kept slipping down with our feet off the “bed”. Plus with all the windows gone there was quite a breeze coming through. Must have gotten down to low 40’s. Anyhoot, we woke pretty early and it wasn’t raining so we decided to head down the mountain (our fellow Virginians we’re still asleep in their bags). Trail down Killington is quite gradual. We made it maybe a mile or so when the rains started. Light rain mostly with a couple harder spells. Stopped at Churchill Scott shelter to get out of rain and have an early lunch. The last couple miles the rains stopped, we then parted ways with the Long Trail which we’ve been sharing since entering Vermont (it heads north to the Canadian border and we head east towards New Hampshire) and we got to the Long Trail Inn a little before 2 pm. This is a great place. Before they rerouted the AT it used to be right on the trail. Now it’s 0.5m off using a sidetrail. Great woodworking throughout and this huge boulder incorporated into one side of the dining room. It’s historic but room updated and really nice. 15 miniutes after we got there, Wreck was on the bus to Rutland to get resupplies.

There were periods when the rain stopped but most of the day it was raining and for a couple hours raining pretty hard.

It was great. Met three nice folks with two great rescue golden retrievers there. Very friendly. Climbed Quimby Mountain (which seemed to go on forever - but it was raining pretty hard so that might have affected our judgement).

Nice private cabin with “poop” deck that allows hikers to stay free. Talked with group of hikers there headed by the son of the owners of the Long Trail Inn. We told him how much we loved it. Lots of southbound traffic recently. More than Wreck can remember from 2015. (we wonder if that is really the case). Worse hill of the day was the last Dana Hill.

Up and down the first two hills (both too steep but, after we saw the three red spotted newts climbing the second hill  we decided we better not complain - by the way, the slow train to Maine beat the newts up the hill!!) and we came to a sign that announced two former thruhikers had bought the farmhouse next to the trail and had a little food supply shop on their back porch. We stopped in and each had a delicious hard boiled egg and a drink (Coke - Wreck, Starbucks Mocha -Brighty). Powered by the second breakfast we climbed the third grinder of a hill and found a mother lode of red raspberries on top (Soundbounders have been talking about fields of raspberries for the last couple days). They were plentiful and delicious!!  Then it was down to the road and west 0.2m to the Cloudland store for homemade sandwiches and ice cream. As we were eating on their covered porch the skies opened up and it really rained. We ate a little slower. A check of the radar showed lots of rain moving our way but the heaviest stuff looked like it was passing to our west (and we’re heading east towards New Hampshire). Rain slackened as we were leaving and while it rained off and on the rest of the day we never did get the really heavy rain predicted. The trail up Thistle Hill was actually good and except for a crazy steep uphill right before this campsite, the trail wasn’t hard for us the rest of the day (Southbounders still had a steep haul coming from the White River.)  Went over quite a few open fields on top today - one more great raspberry patch and several with quite a lot of flowering. In particular the combination of black eyed Susans and Bergamot were beautiful. We got to this area located a flat, well drained site (hopefully as rain is predicted for tonight) and got our tent up, water filtered  etc. Started to rain as we were eating so we had to finish dinner in the tent.

We had lunch at the Ledge, which AWOL in his AT Guide describes as a “precipitous drop off”. Highlight of lunch was seeing a peregrine falcon go gliding by us.

After we packed up this morning (another beautiful day!) we climbed the fire tower for a great view of the New Hampshire mountains.  Probably because of the wet weather we’ve been having lately but we’ve observed since Hanover that New Hampshire rivals (or exceeds) Vermont in mud. This was especially evident coming across Smarts Mountain this morning. Lots of mud and not much trail engineering to prevent it. One section did have an older, broken boardwalk over mud and standing puddles of water well over a foot deep. We started walking a section of boardwalk and it started to sink into the muddy puddle. By the time we got across we went 4-6” in water. Another time Wreck slipped off log crossing wet mud and sunk in over his right boot in mud.  So, in general, we haven’t been too impressed with the quality of trails in this section maintained by the Dartmouth Outdoor Club BUT we were impressed by the 7 college-age members of the Dartmouth trails crew heading up Smarts to put in a weeks work improving trail. Really nice, enthusiastic folks. Thanks for your work!!!!   Well, it’s almost August and the woods are changing.

Due to the ease of trail the slow train to Maine pulled into this hostel about 4pm. It’s very rustic but nice. We both had a shower (outside) so most of the mud is gone. Wreck took the shuttle in for a couple deli sandwiches, we’ve eaten, there’s no bear bags to hang and a real bed is calling. Tomorrow we climb up and over Mt Moosilauke.

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599127,"Yahoo!!!!  We’re in the Whites!!!  Up and hiking the road back to the AT by 7am. It was supposed to rain today and we wanted to get as far over Moosilauke as we could in dry weather.  Brighty’s slackpacking today to save her knees the huge downhill we’ve got. The folks at the hostel bought her backpack over to The Notch hostel in North Woodstock where we are tonight. Moosilauke is one BIG mountain (4802ft) and we had nearly a 3,800ft climb this morning to reach its summit. Weather started off clear but the clouds came in as the morning wore on. We just put it in low (extra low?) and chugged up. Reached the south summit by about 11am. Clouds starting to dominate the sky so very limited views. Walked the one time carriage road over to the main summit. By this time,  no distant views and wind picking up (a good reminder that the alpine areas in the Whites are harsh environs). Got a picture at the summit sign and dropped down for a little food. Guess it was about 1 pm when we really started down the mountain. No Pants thought that Moosilauke may be the steepest downhill in the Whites.   We agree!!!  Didn’t reach Kinsman Notch until after 5 pm. At times we were walking down a waterfall. Other times just a really steep rocky trail. Tremendous shoutout to Beaver Brooks that we paralleled the last couple miles. Wow!  A continuous cascading waterfall nearly all the way down. Fantastic. Rain started in earnest maybe 30 minutes from finishing and we feel fortunate. Hate to think about going downhill the whole way in the rain. Hit the road, stuck out our thumbs and 30 seconds later the first car that passed had picked us up. Great guy from New Jersey on vacation in the area. He dropped us off at The Notch. Brighty’s pack greeted us. We showered, Wreck got a ride to a local market  and food truck, we ate, conversed with the crowd of hikers staying here (some we know, some we just met) and now we’re pooped and heading to bed. We survived our first day in the Whites so we get to advance again. But first we’re going to take a zero and chill in the greater North Woodstock/Lincoln area.","Glen cliff, NH

Got up (after 7am) and went downstairs and fixed real blueberry pancakes and eggs for breakfast. The Notch is a first class hostel (and there are a number of them on the trail) with a kitchen, dining room and living room available to hikers. TieDye and Justin are a really sharp, talented  young couple and they are doing a great job. Bookie, who thru hiked in 2015 (same year as Wreck) is a great and always cheerful resource here too. Bookie drove us into Lincoln for the afternoon. We resupplied, fixed Brighty’s trekking pole issues, had a great lunch at the Gypsy Cafe and went and saw Mission Impossible at the theatre. Got back to the hostel and organized for tomorrow. Toward dinner Late Start showed up and she and Brighty sipped a little wine on the front porch. Had dinner with her (chicken, corn on the cob and broccoli) before she got picked up by a college friend for a couple days off trail.  Tomorrow they’re calling for a wet one but the slow train to Maine is heading north anyway.

Shuttle had us back to the trailhead by a little after 7am. Weather supposed to be rainy all day but just cloudy this morning.  Big climb out of Kinsman Notch (big climbs out of all the notches in the Whites). Trail was slow going almost all day. Lots of mud, roots and rocks. The slow train to Maine was down to about one mile/hour.  Chugging along through the spruce/fir forest - the balsam firs were particularly aromatic today - it was like hiking through a Christmas tree forest!  Second big climb was up Mt Wolf. We reached four false summits before reaching the real summit. No real views from on top. Trail slow again coming down. Leveled out right before reaching this shelter. Rain started picking up too.  It’s stopped now but suppose to pick up later. We’re staying in shelter - and it’s a very nice one. Good group here and camping nearby.

",Eliza Brook shelter,"Aug 03, Fri",7.50
Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599425,"Wow!!  This was a memorable day - although not in the most pleasurable terms. Rains started in earnest as we were going to bed and were pretty steady all night. By daybreak the question in the shelter was who would leave first. I turned  out to be the young college age thruhiker who was putting in big miles to reach Katahdin before school started again. We were second out and Eliza Brook which was a mild rock hop across last evening was a raging torrent this morning. We located a semi safe crossing and plunged through mid thigh level (Later we learned that folks who waited a couple hours to leave camp had waist deep water to deal with). About a mile north we had another crossing of Eliza Brooks of similar difficulty. Rain most of the morning with skies finally clearing by afternoon. The damage was done though and the trail was a stream much of the day. Boardwalks were five inches under water, steps were cascades, Wreck who has done a fair share of wet hiking over the years hadn’t seen this much water on the trail since he and Pothole hiked literally up Raven Fork stream in the Smokies years ago. Adding to the challenge was the fact that the trail was ascending 2,000 ft up Kinsman Mountain (4358 ft) which has a pretty good amount of four limbed climbed involved and then descended down Kinsman with more four limbed climbing involved. Thought we might get limited views up top but no such luck.  Further down we did get done great views of Franconia Ridge and the mountain above Lonesome Lake. Got to Cascade Brook about 7pm. We had been hearing about the crossing from other hikers during the day. By the time we got there it was,we guess, about at its peak. Wreck started across with water at mid thigh and based on his trekking poles determined the deepest and swiftest water at the crossing to be waist deep. Brighty wisely suggested we camp and cross in the morning so we’ve gone 200 ft+ off trail downstream and are camping by this raging waterfalls. Hadn’t planned to be out another night so we’ve drained our food bags (including the last of the Karen’s Just Veggies which we picked up at the Coop in Hanover). It’s cleared off so we’re hoping all this water can run off the mountain past us by morning.  For now it’s time to get some rest.","Eliza Brook shelter

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599582,"Woke up and it seemed like the waterfall we camped next to was less raging (we saw rocks this morning).  Packed up and got to the stream crossing and it was only mid calf level. One more stream downstream was of similar size. Got to the intersection of the AT with the one mile paved trail to the Flume Visitor Center. Bookie picked us up at the Visitor Center and we headed back to the hostel. This afternoon we made some decisions. Brighty has taken several falls recently (none serious) but that combined with the seriously steep ups AND downs (always the worst part) on the trail now and further north have gotten her thinking that maybe her Appalachian Trail hike (2,000 miles hiking in over 200 days, 129 nights camping in our Tarptent, etc etc) was about complete. Wreck, who had seen Brighty work harder on the trail than anyone else couldn’t disagree. So the slow train to Maine is going to call it a hike - we walked this evening over to the Woodstock Inn to celebrate our hike. Wreck is both mentally and physically (he too took a fall yesterday and banged up his knee)  torn about continuing on without his engineer. We’ll sleep on it and make final decisions in the morning.","Cascade Brook

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599586,"Woke up this morning and Wreck’s knee was improving (maybe 75%) so he decided to hike on while Brighty headed back to good ole Virginia. Tie Dye had Wreck to the trailhead by 7:30 and Brighty to town by 10:30 am. Originally Brighty was thinking to taking a bus from Lincoln, NH to Frederick, MD but had trouble getting information about tickets. In the end she got a shuttle into Plymouth, NH and is spending the night there. She’ll rent a car in the morning and start the drive home. Wreck meanwhile headed out of Franconia Notch  - always a steep uphill and in this case a nearly 3,000 ft initial climb up to the Franconia Ridge trail. Then it was up some more into the alpine environment above tree line at Little Haystack Mountain (4800 ft). Spent the next several miles walking Franconia Ridge over Mt Lincoln and Mt Lafayette. Weather fantastic and views on both sides of trail phenomenal. This is one of the most spectacular sections of the AT. Dropped off Lafayette (steep) and after several miles climbed Mt Garfield. More great views particularly Twin Mountain where the trail goes over tomorrow. Got to this campsite a little after six and am bushed (some hand over hand climbing today - always a workout and hot and humid today). Good news is knee improved as day went on. Large nice  crowd at campsite.   Miss Brighty bunches but think she made the right decision. For now it’s time to shut down for the night.","Franconia Notch

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599891,"Warm night for nearly 4000 ft. It was an early rising crowd in the shelter. The folks next to me were gone a little after 5am. I was the LAST one up at 6 am. Forgot to mention an interesting hiker I met yesterday. There are two classes of long distance hikers I’ve always marveled over. First are the blind hikers. They are incredible stories. The second group, definitely a step down but still amazing are the barefoot hikers. Met one yesterday (appropriately named Barefoot). He was coming from Katahdin heading south.  Nice guy, said feet are getting “leathery”. Only issue I had were the toenails (painted Carolina blue). Today the trail started off down Mt Garfield in a stream/waterfall. (When No Pants and I did this section in 2014 I got halfway down, thought this can’t be the trail, climbed back up and found out that it was indeed the trail).  Good rock but bet it wasn’t fun a couple days ago when we had all that rain. Stopped by Galehead Hut and had a couple slices of delicious peach coffee cake (one of the nice things about the Whites is the extra food opportunities that the huts provide.) Thus powered I climbed South Twin Mountain (4902 ft). Good weather, great views. On one side you can see Franconia Ridge where we were yesterday, on the other side you can see the Presidential range, the next mountains the AT goes over. I lingered for quite awhile up there. Finally dropped down then up Mt Guyot (more nice views) and finally down to this AMC hut. Great timing too as the thunder started about 2 miles from the hut, skies kept getting darker and, about 0.5miles away a light rain started. Got to hut and rain picked up. Originally I was able to get one space here for Brighty and I was going to hike to the next shelter but since Brighty was in her rental car heading south (and planning her next adventure) I took her spot..  Big crowd here (it’s full). We’ve eaten and I’m rapidly feeling sleep coming on. (Slept poorly for some reason last night). Still missing Brighty but more convinced then ever she made the right decision.","Garfield shelter

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599892,"Up to a big breakfast at the hut (oatmeal, eggs, bacon and pancakes.) I must say the portion size was much better at this hut than my experience in 2015. Mattress (2” thick?) was not very good. About 30 minutes after lying down I thought I should put my comfortable thermarest on top but didn’t want to disturb room. Overall the hut experience is overpriced but okay (I think Brighty would like it more than me and, hopefully we can come back to the Whites for a short hut to hut to hut trip in the future.). Today’s trail was tame by Whites standards (yes still lots of rock and you have to be constantly careful- my trekking poles slipped on a log and I took a tumble a couple miles from the end, sore wrist but otherwise fine). Despite the ease of the trail I was struggling early on. Then met nice day hiker from nearby and we hiked some together and the rest of the day was fine. That’s how it works sometimes - just needed something to kick me in gear. Had a little trail magic towards Crawford Notch (part of which was melted ice cream bars). Not to be too critical here but ice cream just doesn’t survive long enough to be practical. (Unless Odesimus is running it in to Upper Goose - and then just barely). Saw M&M at trail magic.   Super nice Irish couple (living in Australia for 20+ years) whom Brighty and I have been running into since Vermont. They were going to try and hitch into North Conway, something like 20 miles away. I was just going to this campground 1.8 miles off trail so I decided to walk. Got within 0.5m of here when a familiar van pulled up and honked the horn. It was Miss Janet, trail angel extraordinaire. We had not seen her since maybe North Carolina last year. We chatted for awhile and she drove me into the campground. I’ve got a nice little leanto to myself. Got here early in the afternoon. Cleaned up (a little as “showers” were coin operated and I had no change) and took a nap. Lazed around until dinner. I’ve eaten, the river is babbling away in the distance and it’s time to shut down for the night. Rain never came today but I believe that’s just going to increase the chances for tomorrow.

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600007,"Well . . . I think it rained some last night. But I slept hard so I may have dreamed it!  Left the good ole leanto a little before 8am. Tried to hitch back to the trailhead but no success so I ended up walking the 1.8m back (Vermont was such a great state for hitching rides that it spoiled me). Up the trail out of the Notch. Like just about all trails out of Notches it was steep. Unlike some though the trail was not too rocky. I just put it in low and went. Got a couple miles up and ran into older hiker coming down who asked where I was coming from. Turns out he had gotten off trail and when he got back on headed the wrong way. Made me wonder how many folks get seriously lost especially in bad weather. Today’s weather started cloudy and humid. Got to the first views along Webster Cliffs and clouds were coming in. Thought it may be like 2015 when things went downhill weather wise from there but weather never got bad - a little sun, a little rain and quite a lot of wind along the cliffs.   After the cliffs trail has a lot of short four limbed climbing sections up to Mt Webster and then Mt Jackson (more going up Webster). Had reception so checked in at home - Brighty made it back in one day (once you point those miles toward home they take off!). During one sunny moment I took a break north of Mt Jackson. Had some food/water and it started to rain. Sunny again by the time I reached this hut. Had nice bowl of soup and delicious large slice of pumpkin cake. Lazed around the afternoon and had big dinner. (Lasagna so Brighty would have loved it- but not the trail coming up here. She made a wise decision.)  Listened to program given by trail crew. Big push working on Crawford Path whose bicentennial is coming up. Wow!  A 200 year old trail!!!  The sun has set and the bed is now calling (and yes I have blown up my thermarest and put it on top the huts other mattress).","Crawford Notch

By mid morning the sun was out and the rest of the day was fantastic. Windy on western exposures (peak wind at Mt Washington was 72 mph today but I don’t think I experienced anything over 40 mph). What a day to be in the high country and that’s where I was. Climbed Mt Pierce early on then ran the ridge line around Mt Eisenhower and Mt Monroe to this hut. Shoutout to the blueberries of the high country. Maybe because of the rain but they seem extra big and extra sweet this year (and they’re ripe!!). Ordinarily I probably would have taken advantage of the great weather and hiked around the whole Great Gulf but I made this hut reservation a couple weeks ago so here I am. Got here about 1 pm and had some soup and hot chocolate. Then hiked up to the summit of Mt Monroe. More fantastic views. I stayed up there quite awhile just taking in the view. Hiked down and then up above the ponds/lakes that give this hut its name and again took in the view. It was a very relaxing but enjoyable afternoon. Had dinner (including barbecue chicken) and, despite the light day, I feel sleep coming on. Tomorrow I meet my hiking partner of 35 years, Pothole, up at Mt Washington and around the Great Gulf we go.

Alas, this was the last hut reservation I could make for Brighty. It’s roughing it from now on. Left Lakes of the Clouds about 8am and the trail climbed Mt Washington. Nice weather all day and little wind (which is unusual for one the the windiest places in the country). I started out in long sleeves and long pants and had to go to t shirt and shorts before I reached Washington. Talk about timing!  As I summited Washington in pulls a van with Pothole!  We went inside the observatory for a few minutes? Came out and stood in line for our summit picture and were off. Great hiking with Pothole. We had a lot to catch up on. The nice Saturday weather brought out a crowd of extremely fit day hikers, most doing large mileage days in the Whites. The traverse of the Presidential range bagging all the peaks along the way seemed most popular. That’s a major day!  Got to Edmonds Col and had lunch, gazing up at Mt Jefferson to the south and Mt Adams to the north, both big mountains. Reached Madison hut about 2:30pm and went inside where I had some soup. Fortified we climbed Mr Madison. I love that Peak!  Great views!  Finally it was down, down, down Madison, one of the longest downhills in the Whites. Finally reached back into the trees (after 8+ miles today above tree line in the alpine zone.) Pothole, who had several more miles to hike (to his car) than I did moved ahead.

Short day today combined with long day yesterday resulted in me not leaving camp until almost 9am. Weather was misty much of the way. My hiking really slows on a wet trail - rocks and especially roots really get slick. And the first couple miles today had nothing but rocks and roots. Once I crossed the auto road going up to Mt Washington the trail became great. Got into Pinkham about 11:30am and Pothole was waiting. We went into the Visitor Center for lunch and then went on a couple short hikes to some nice waterfalls. A bunch of climbers repelling down one of the falls. Afterwards Pothole dropped me off at this hostel so I could shower, etc.  We went to Walmart and an AYCE Oriental place in Gorham  (which No Pants and I ate in a few years ago and I really enjoyed again).

But I survive!  Pothole picked me up at the hostel and had me back on the trail by 7:30 am. This section through the Wildcats has the reputation of being perhaps the toughest in the Whites and I certainly wouldn’t argue. From Pinkham Notch the trail goes up 2,000 ft in less than 3 miles to Wildcat Peak E. But that doesn’t come close to describing how tough a trail that is. Lots of large boulders, lots of hand over hand climbing. I kept thinking “boy, I’m glad I’m not climbing down this”.  From Wildcat E it’s over to Peaks D (which is surreal in that after all this climbing you reach an area with an operating gondola taking people up the mountain) C, and A (the trail skips by Peak B  which by this time was fine with me). After the Wildcats the trail drops STEEPLY into Carters Notch and then up steeply again 1,500 ft to Carters Dome. Climbing down the Notch I ran into my “AMC buddy” JP. We met in 2015 as he was finishing his winter caretaker job on Mt LeConte in the Smokies and was walking the trail to the Whites for his summer job and again in the Whites with him carrying 105 pounds of food down Mt Washington to the hut. Sure enough JP had another large load of stuff he was hauling out of the Carter Notch hut where he is now the manager. We caught up quickly - he’s not wintering on LeConte anymore, Vermont instead. Down at the hut I had the best bowl of soup in the Whites - a turkey vegetable with real turkey!!!  Still the climb out of the Notch was slow - all day was slow. Went over Mt Height (great views in 2015, just clouds today) and steeply down to the Zeta Pass. Up Middle and North Carter Mountain (more clouds), a wickedly steep down from North Carter and finally at 7:30 pm rolled (staggered?) into this campsite. 13 miles in 12 hours with probably less than an hour of breaks. And it wasn’t like I was lallygagging - I was going as fast as I could. One saving grace was the predicted rains for the most part held off. Rained in Carter Notch and coming up Carter Dome but the rest of the day was just cloudy.  Shelter here was pretty packed with young kids so I’m camping on platform. Just able to set up tent in last light, cooked and ate in the dark and now - it’s time to shut down for the night and let this body recover - hopefully!","Pinkham Notch

Trail really wet and rocky which made for slow going. Like yesterday just views of clouds up high (climbed Mt Moriah early on). Finally came down to the Rattle River and found an actual dirt trail. Wow!  The then the sun came out!  Covered the last 2 miles in 40 minutes which is sort of reassuring to me as I was beginning to think that 1 mile/hour was all I could do. Back at the Rattle River hostel, which is literal right on the trail. Within the first hour I had put up my tent and dried it, showered, had my clothes washed, and organized my gear. Went to Walmart with the resupply shuttle and (I must have been channeling Brighty) bought a steak to grill back at the hostel. Steak, baked potato and fresh corn on the cob - not a meal you get on the trail. Also, some section hiker finished recently here and left a bunch of dehydrated  food in the freebie box.

More rain early this morning so I got a little later start than anticipated with a wet tent. Trail not the greatest this morning - lots of really overgrown sections. Plus the AMC in New Hampshire just doesn’t like to paint white blazes on the trees. Winds picked up early on so I knew the weather was a changing. By the time I summited Mt Success the skies were blue with lots of sunshine. Stayed that way the rest of the day although remained quite windy in the high elevations.  Reached the Maine border for lunch. Wow what a difference in trails this afternoon - specifically trail engineering. Saw more white blazes in the first couple miles of Maine as in all the Whites practically. Plus great boardwalks, rebar and wooden ladders, etc. and interestingly I’m still in AMC territory but the Maine chapter is doing great. Not to bash the AMC in New Hampshire but you just get the feeling they have too many trails in the Whites to maintain and many of those trails were built long ago and frankly with poor design. AMC tries its best to maintain them but seem overwhelmed. Anyhoot while this Maine section is very tough I really enjoyed the trail design and improvements. It was actually fun climbing Goose Eye Mountain - great views from all three peaks. Got to this shelter around 5:30pm and there was no way I could finish Mahoosic Notch today.

Weather this morning was great which was lucky for me as this morning I went through the “most fun mile” on the trail, a jumble of boulders you climb around, over and under in Mahoosic Notch. Just as I was starting the Notch I ran into a nice quartet of dayhikers from PA (two which were finishing their 15 yr long hike of the AT by hiking the Notch/Arm and then Mt Katahdin).   In 2015 it took me 2 1/2 hours
to hike the mile through the Notch. This year it took me 2 1/2 hours to go through the Notch. Yes I went slow and careful. Think I had to take my pack off several more times this year than 2015 which means I went under instead of over several more jumbles. Finished up the Notch a little after 11am and had an early lunch with the Pennsylvanians at the Bull Branch campsite. Then it was up Mahoosic Arm, a 1,300 ft climb some folks find as hard as the Notch. I just put it into extra low. It’s actually a climb you’d much rather go up than down - lots of steep rock slabs. Weather held as I climbed the Arm. Got to Speck Pond and it started to sprinkle. That plus the prediction of potentially severe thunderstorms tonight plus the fact that the next shelter was 6.9 miles away convinced me to call it quits for the day although it was only 2:30pm. In between sprinkles I went down to the pond and cleaned up slightly. I’ve eaten, talked to the caretaker here and ready to call it a night - although it’s only 7:30pm.

I had some of all!!  Wow just what my body needed!  Thanks Big Al!!!  And just at the right time as the trail climbed Baldpate Mountain (3810 ft) next. Another long tough climb but with all the food magic my body did much better. Baldpate was one of my favorite mountains in 2015. Raining and socked in the clouds this year. Still great steps right near tree line of West Peak. Above tree line Baldpate’s rocks got less grippy. In fact some got slippery!!  Going up (using all four limbs) I slipped a number of times with no damage. Coming across the top I slipped twice and fell. Tore my rain pants the first fall, bruised my right side the second time. What concerned me were several southbounders telling me on top how slippery it was to come down. I’d already fallen twice and now I had to go down a steep, slippery mountain. Well, I went really carefully (slow). Slipped a couple times but didn’t fall anymore. Got to the shelter about 4:45pm and decided to push to this site further down the mountain. Got in a little before 7pm. I’m the only one here. Ate, put up the bear bag (first time in forever as all the sites since before the Whites  have had bear boxes) and I’m tucked into the tent. Good day but a long one. I’m hoping for a good nights sleep!!!","Speck Pond

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601091,"Well after a long but good day yesterday I figured the body wouldn’t be able to repeat today. I was right. Trail probably was a little tamer but tougher for me. Trail climbed Wyman Mountain this morning. Wyman isn’t a big mountain (just under 3,000 ft) but not a great trail climbing it - lots of roots, rocks, areas where trail is eroding and slanted, lots of quick turns - it all makes it very hard to maintain any pace at all. Slow and tough going. After Wyman it was a steep down into Sawyer Notch and then a steep up to Moody Mountain. The thing I’ve noticed about Southern Maine (like the Whites) is everything seems to be straight up and straight down these mountains. The saving grace today was great weather. Trail still really muddy but rocks were dry. That makes a world of difference. On top of Moody I called the Pine Ellis hostel to arrange a pickup. Got to the road and got picked up along with six slackpackers (coming from the north). I stayed at the Pine Ellis in 2015. It’s definitely in a lower class the the great hostels I’ve been in recently but the folks are nice and I remember a very soft bed last time. This time and place is packed with folks slackpacking. I’m sleeping in the bunkhouse (ie shed) instead of the main house and the mattress is not very good. By the time I checked in the slackpackers were in  shower mode (only one bathroom in hostel) and I was told I would be showering seventh. Well, I didn’t need a shower that much anyhoot so I did laundry, went to the General store to resupply and eat dinner (I was hoping for veggies and grilled meat but everything was fried on the menu - ended up with the fried chicken) and came back and took shower about 8pm. I’m bushed now. The bed although hard is calling","Dunn Notch

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601092,"Well that bed was hard last night. Didn’t sleep well and then at 5am everyone else in the shed (bunkhouse) had their alarms go off. They had a 6am shuttle back to the trail. Needless to say lots of noise and activity. I finally got up about 5:30am, stretched and went to breakfast back at the General Store. Got shuttle back to trailhead by 8:30am. Another tough day of roots, rocks, mud and steep mountains. Thought my big breakfast would make things easier this morning. Think it actually made things harder. Trail climbed 2,200ft to Old Blue Mountain. Some nice steps and rebar ladders made it slightly easier but mostly it was a tough slog. View marginal at best on top. Today the trail went through quite a few boggy, muddy areas on boardwalk - unfortunately most of the boardwalk was quite old and broken or rotten. Your boots were going to get wet and muddy today. Heard story to one hiker who fell off boardwalk into waist deep mud. I believe it!  Several times my trekking poles have gone several feet down without hitting bottom. Second climb of day was up Bemis Mountain. Trail really slow and rooty between two mountains but okay up Bemis. Trail spends a lot of time on top Bemis (3 miles). Lots of winding around on rock outcrops. Trail well marked but in bad weather things might be harder to follow. Luckily, like yesterday, weather was great. After lunch my body felt a lot better hiking. Great blueberries on the rock outcrops of Bemis. Eventually you have to put the blinders on and just hike. Got to this campsite about 6:15pm. Folks finishing up trail magic on road just south of here. I got a couple apples and filled my water bottles. That saved some time with dinner preparation. Thanks so much!  I’ve eaten and all the chores are done. Think it’s going to be in the 40’s tonight. Time to zip up the bag and call it a day.","South Arm Rd

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601098,"Well I made the mistake of reading about this section of trail in my 2015 journal. I called it an overall “tame” section and, in 2015, was finished by 2:30pm. Hmmmm. I’m impressed with my 2015 self but depressed with my 2018 self!  I struggled again. Not to get redundant but lots roots, rocks and mud. Again saving grace was dry weather and today the lack of large steep climbs (after the first 0.8 m that went straight up to ME17). Stopped at the sandy beach before the Sabbath Pond leanto late this morning and was in need of an attitude adjustment. Went for a quick dip. That helped somewhat. The downhill and somewhat less rooty and muddy nature of the trail the last 5 miles from Little Swift River pond helped even more. Got to the road at 5:30pm. Nice treat at the road was running into the honeymooning hikers, Galaxy and Songbird. Hadn’t seen them since Massachusetts. They are doing well and were preparing to head a little further north. Me?  I was heading 0.3m down the road to the Hiker Hut hostel. Fun but primitive hostel totally off the grid. Had comfortable hot outside shower thanks to propane heated water on demand system. Steve, the owner, is a nice interesting guy who fed me bonfire cooked popcorn when I arrived  and later had some veggies he had cooked which I mixed with my Mac and cheese. I’m content and ready for bed.","Dirt Road campsite

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601355,"I’m zeroing today and it’s a great day for it. My body is in desperate need for a rest and the weather forecast calling for rain is spot on. Steve made us egg sandwiches for breakfast. I really like this place but glad today to have the chance to go into town and charge electronics, etc. Rangely has a nice library where I spent a good part of the day. Made some tentative arrangements to get home (should be finishing Saturday), had lunch with Jerry, nice section hiker from near Nashville, had  milk shake, went to IGA for resupply and came back to the Hiker Hut for a delicious lentil vegetable stew and cornbread. Marcus, German southbound hiker (whose already hiked AT, CDT, PCT, and Arizona Trail) came in after 20+ miles over the Saddlebacks in the rain. Quite friendly and cheerful spirit.  Hung out around the fire pit for a bit but it’s hiker midnight (about 8pm now). Time for bed.","ME4 Rangeley ME

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601356,"Up around 5:30pm. Jerry is slackpacking today and is getting a 6am shuttle. After a nice egg sandwich, tea, Dr Pepper and brownie I was off for the trail around 7:15am. Really liked Hiker Hut. Nice folks, nice vibe.  I think the Dr Pepper and the zero day yesterday helped me. Today I felt much stronger hiking. First 6 miles today were up Saddleback Mountain (4120 ft). Besides Katahdin, Saddleback may have the most above tree line alpine area in Maine. Today that alpine area was wild. We had a cold front move in last night and the winds on top today must have been close to 60 mph (someone said 70 mph but that was probably stretching it). Nonetheless it was wild. Wind pushed you every step. I was staggering, struggling to keep on the trail. (Galaxy, half of the honeymooning thruhikers, said at one point he was blown 5 ft off trail). Once off the top, things became calmer. I tucked into a protected area between Saddleback and the Horn and had a food break. Wind, while strong, was somewhat diminished by the time I reached the summit of the Horn (3985 ft). By the time I got over to Saddleback Junior (3655 ft) it was just a nice 20 mph breeze on top. Bunch of Harvard freshmen on top as well (preorientation program). Very polite. Dropped off the mountain, had some more food on the Poplar Ridge summit, had to put my crocs on to ford Orbeton stream and am camping on same roadbed above stream that I did in 2015. Bunch more Harvard freshmen camped nearby (I believe Harvard should spread their kids out more, 25+ folks within a couple of miles of  each other really puts a burden on the resource particularly during the peak time for AT thruhikers.  Doesn’t anyone at Harvard take a Leave No Trace course???). Anyhoot, I’m further down the roadbed, they’re having a singalong by a bonfire, and I’m hitting the hay. Less than 20 miles to Stratton from here.","Route 4 - Rangeley ME

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601359,"Slept in a little today. Up and on the trail around 8:30am. Had two things going for me today. Another nice weather day and, for much of the day, a decent trail. (Shoutout to the trail yesterday too. While there were bad sections - my entire boot went under mud more than once - overall trail more cared for and in better condition than previous days). Glad to have that going for me as my body, once again, couldn’t put two good days back to back. I struggled in sections today. Climbed several mountains today - Lone, Spaulding and Sugerloaf. No great views and the ones I got were hazy. Really steep downhill off Sugarloaf to the Carrabassett River. By that time I was bushed so sat on a rock and watched the water go by. Finally climbed up to this campsite. It’s a nice one with the stream babbling nearby. Last night in Maine. Tomorrow I’ll hike to ME27 near Stratton where Brighty and I got off trail last year. Then it’s back to see my favorite hiking partner and soulmate so we can finish this AT journey together by hiking from Gathland into Harpers Ferry. First it’s time for some rest in my home away from home- our good ole Double Rainbow Tarptent.","Woods road 0.1m N of Orbeton Stream

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601461,"Up at 5:30am. Another hazy but nice weather day. Trail steep from the start climbing up South Crocker. Steep but little need for four limbs which was nice. Best views of the day during that first mile up. Climbed down and up North Crocker and then a long 5+ miles downhill to the road. Trail was good. Side hill construction, waterbars, etc. Still rooty but not nearly the erosion I’ve been seeing particularly south of Saddleback. Got to the road around noon and Maine is done!  Hitched a ride into town with about the tenth car that passed. Super nice local guy. He dropped me off in Stratton. Trout at the hostel let me take a shower there. Thanks Trout!!!  Got some lunch at the grocery, Seth shuttled me into Augusta and I’m at the Comfort Inn near the bus station ready to head home tomorrow. Seems like I’ve been hiking for a long time. I’m ready to head home and see the family!!!  As mentioned before, Brighty and I still need to finish Maryland for our hike to be complete. Hopefully we can get that done in next week.

Brighty and Wreck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602585,"The slow train to Maine is back . . . but now in Maryland heading to Harpers Ferry where we started from way back on October 16, 2016. After over 230 days of hiking we’ve got a little over 10 miles left in our AT adventure.  We met up at Gathland State Park about 3pm - Brighty coming from home, Wreck (who last fall skackpacked Brighty through the rest of Maryland and didn’t hike it all) coming south from Pen Mar where he started yesterday. It’s still summer here - temperatures near 90 and humid. Trail in Maryland has its rocky sections but compared to New Hampshire and Maine seems quite tame. Couple southbound thruhikers on trail, rest of folks we met out for shorter sections. We got into the Ed Garvey shelter around 5pm. This is the shelter Brighty always wanted to be her last on the adventure - and it’s a really nice one! Just south of the shelter is the parcel that Wreck’s grandfather and later, Uncle Bill owned before selling to the state of Maryland when they were establishing a permanent trail corridor.  In fact, we’re pretty sure that the trail leading down to the spring goes thru a part of “Uncle Bill’s land”. It’s a long, nearly 1/2 mile walk down to get water and Wreck was nearly there when he heard the first rumbles of thunder. Walking back up after collecting and filtering bunches of water the thunder became much more frequent. As luck would have it just a couple minutes after getting back to the shelter the rains started. Ate dinner at the covered picnic table along with three section hikers, and Eagle fans, from Pennsylvania. By the end of dinner the storm had moved on and the temperature had cooled down nicely. We’re in our beloved Tarptent for the 138th time. Nights are definitely coming earlier this days. It’s dark by 8 pm and we’re shutting down for the night.","Crampton Gap

From there it’s down to the C &O Canal towpath. And last 3+ miles into Harpers Ferry are along the towpath.  We stop along the banks of the Potomac and enjoy the river flowing along.   As a bonus we get to see a bald eagle take flight from a sycamore along the river banks. Nice way to end the adventure!  We cross the bridge into Harpers Ferry and the journey is complete.  Hard to describe our adventure in a few words. We’ve got a ton of shared memories.
