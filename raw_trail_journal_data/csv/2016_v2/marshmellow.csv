On the hostel scale it weighed 46 pounds yikes. I had my first problem at dinner. I use a jetboil stove, with a very intense, laser like flame. One should ONLY use the Jetboil pot, but I didn't know this, so I put a big pan on the stove, which diffused the flame, melting the plastic band surrounding the stove, with the result that the stove no longer fit inside the Jetboil pan. I solved the problem by using my Bic lighter as a blowtorch, re-melting the plastic and scraping it away with my pocket knife until it fit properly back into the pot. I have never been a repair guy, so I got a lot of satisfaction from doing my own repair. It was all for nothing, as a few days later, I sent my Jetboil home in favor of an alcohol stove.","Springer Mt.

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524181,"In the year 2000, I was part of a group of 250 people who did a one year around the world bicycle tour. Every nite, a different caterer (We cycled about 80 miles per day, and every nite we were in a new place) made dinner for 250 people. It was a HUGE task, so every nit we gave the caterer a standing ovation. Well, old habits die hard, so when I finished cooking dinner for myself on nite 2, I rose to my feet and gave myself a thunderous standing ovation. I pulled out all the stops, too. I screamed, I clapped, I whistled, I stamped my feet, then I finished it off by bellowing at the top of my lungs, ""Bill, that was the GREATEST meal I have ever eaten!"" Well, everyone else in camp was giving me VERY strange looks, and nobody would speak to me, and a few people even went so far as to take down their tent and moved their tents as far away from me as possible. Well, I learned my lesson, and the next night, at the conclusion of my dinner, I uttered not a single word of praise on my own behalf, and it sure did the trick. My camp mates were once again very friendly & cordial to me, but I went to bed feeling very hurt and resentful, because I worked very hard to prepare myself a good meal, and I received not even a single word of thanks for it. I tried to keep an open mind, but I couldn't help but think that I was just a selfish uncaring cad. The moral of this story is that everything on the Appalachinn Trail (AT) is a tradeoff.","Hawk Mt.

Every 25 miles, there is a rest stop, where cyclists can refill their water bottles and get tasty snacks. I was walking towards one rest stop. Directly in front of me was a newly married couple, cuddling with each other as they walked towards the refreshments. The young lady was EXTREMELY attractive. She stopped cuddling with her husband briefly. I was right next to her, thinking of all the good food I was about to eat. Life was VERY good. Suddenly, with no warning, the attractive young lady threw her arm around me, drew herself to me, and began snuggling. Life went from very good to heavenly. After a second or two, she screamed, pushed me away, and shouted ""You're not my husband."" Her husband and several hundred cyclists were giving me VERY angry looks. Life very quickly (in just a few seconds time) went from nearly heavenly to nearly hellish. Then the young lady began to apologize profusely to me, saying she was very sorry to have mistaken me for her husband, and I was off the hook. Life on the Appalachian Trail is very intense, and I have gone from ""all is well"" to ""uh-oh"" very quickly on 2 occasions. Both times I thought I lost an important piece of equiptment, when in fact I had not.

I fill a plastic bag (with a screw top that my Sawyer filter attaches to) with water. Then I attach the Sawyer filter to the plastic bag. squeeze the water from the plastic bag thru the filter, and the water is ready to drink. The water is crystal clear, and delicious. Several years ago, while hiking thru the Colca Canyon in Peru, I had a very bad experience with drinking water from the Colca River (it tasted delicious, but the results were disasterous) I had water purification tablets with me that I used. What I didn't know was that those purification tablets work well in North America, but I guess the germs are different in South America because the pills didn't kill the germs in the water, and I became the proud owner of a raging case of amoebic dysentery. I asked my family doctor why my pills didn't work. His answer was, ""Bill, you bought those pills here in the US, where the primary language is English, but you used them in South America, where the germs are all Spanish speaking. So the germs probably did not understand that your pills were supposed to have killed them."" Shortly afterwords, I began to search for a new doctor.","Neels Gap

Trail Magic occurs when people (mostly people who have hiked the AT in the past) meet hikers on the AT (usually where the AT crosses a road) and surprises them with free food/beverages. My first Trail Magic (TM) experience happened on St. Patricks Day. There was a big group of exhikers camping out who were fans of the rock band called the Grateful Dead. At 10:00 Am, these guys were already plastered, (their motto was, if you're going to drink all day long, you have to get an early start) and listening to Grateful Dead songs. They offered all thru hikers hard boiled eggs and sodas. Later that day, an ex hiker offered hikers free hot dogs, chips, and some of the best brownies I have ever had. Immediately after gorging myself, I had a HUGE mountain to climb. My next TM encounter was with an extremely attractive young lady who offered me a Coors beer. My last TM encounter was when I was staying at the hiker hostel at Neels Gap. A local Baptist church brought in a free pulled pork dinner, complete with cole slaw, baked beans, chips, iced tea, and chocolate cake. TM really lifts my spirits.","Low Gap Shelter

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524267,"On the At you have 3 sleeping options. The first option is to sleep in your tent. The problem with this is that it is sometimes hard to find a level place to pitch your tent. The second option is to sleep in the shelters along the AT. The problem with this is 1) the shelters sleep only a small number of people. 2) The shelters have only 3 walls (of either wood or stone,) so they are very cold and drafty. 3)the shelters are overridden with lots of mice, which run all over you at nite 4) the shelter sleeping area is just a floor, so you sleep literally next to another person, who may snore loudly, and you have no privacy. I VASTLY prefer my tent to a shelter. Tents are also warmer than shelters, which is important. Last nite it was so cold that it snowed. The third option is to sleep in a hiker hostel or a hotel. hiker hostels/hotels happen infrequently, only when the At crosses a road near a town I plan to use this option whenever it presents itself, as I can avail myself of a badly neede shower, wash my clothes, visit with other hikers, and spend a night out of the cold, and go to a store to buy more food.","Unicoi Gap/ Top of Georgia Hiker Hostel

I used to regard an outhouse/privy as a very smelly, disgusting edifice, to be used only in an extreme emergency. On the AT, I have 2 bathroom options. 1) use an outhouse (that is located only where there is a shelter.) This is the luxury option. 2) Have you heard the expression ""Does a bear sh#t in the woods?"" Well, guess what. When a hiker is in the woods for an extende period of time. he/she is also going to need to use the bathroom, and if a luxury privy is not available, the poor hiker is going to drop his backpack, fish out his/her garden trowel, dig a hole 8 inches deep, and take care of business. Yes siree Bob, an outhouse is a luxury. Everyone has a secret fear of what is the worst thing that can happen on the AT.

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524556,"Bears can be a concern on the AT. There are 2 common kinds of bears in the US 1)grizzly bears, that are very big & very dangerous. There are no grizzly bears on the AT 2) black bears These bears are generally harmless if people have not been stupid and fed the bears, causing the bears to lose their natural fear of humans and become aggressive & dangerous to people. Tourists who think they are being kind to bears by feeding them are actually condemning these bears to death, as bears who have lost their fear of people become aggressive, dangerous, and have to be destroyed. The only other time a black bear will be aggressive towards people is if a person is foolish enough to be close to bear cubs. Then mama turns into a raging maniac. On day 3 of my hike, the shelter I wanted to stay at was closed, due to aggressive bears in the past. Only hikers who carried a big, bulky bear cannister with them were allowed to camp at this shelter. I talked to people who stayed at nite at this shelter, and they said they did not see any bears. I walked thru this 6 mile stretch of bear danger territory and saw no evidence of bears. Every nite, all hikers put all of their food into containers and hoist those containers 20 feet in the air via ""bear cables"" that are installed at shelters. If ""bear cables"" are not provided, I have to find a tree and hoist my food bag up. I want to protect my food from being eaten by bears, racoons, or mice","Unicoi Gap/ Top of Georgia Hiker Hostel

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524559,"I have decided that since hiker hostels are infrequent and luxurious, I will utilize them every chance I get. I had the chance to use the Top of Georgia hiker hostel at 2 locations Unicoi Gap, and Dicks Creek Gap. Did anyone see a movie about the AT that came out a few months ago starring Robert Redford/Nick Nolte called ""A Walk in the Woods?"" They show these guys hiking across some very level, easy hiking terrain. Although there are stretches of the trail that are flat and easy, they are relatively rare. The AT is infamous for 3 things: rocks, roots, and ruts. You hike 2200 miles thru the woods. Some people think this hike involves wonderful scenery that a hiker enjoys as he/she strolls along the trail. The reality is a bit different. Yes, there is spectacular scenery, but due to the CONSTANT rocks/roots/ruts, a person who attempts to take in the sights while walking is going to be flat on his/her back very quickly due to tripping over a rock/root/rut. If I want to enjoy the scenery, I have to come to a complete stop from walking to enjoy the view. There are very few level stretches on the AT. One of the acronyms used on the AT is PUDS. It stands for ""Pointless Ups & Downs."" The other day, I descended 700 very sttep feet to a road. Once I got to the road, I immediately struggled with an equally steep 400 foot climb. Contrary to popular belief, it is MUCH harder to go downhill than uphill (although neither direction is a whole lot of fun). Going downhill is MURDER on your knees, plus there is a far greater chance of falling while going downhill as opposed to falling while going uphill.","Deep Gap Shelter

Junior not only sang his father's songs, he told the story of his father's career. My wife and I sat in the nosebleed section, and it still cost an arm and a leg. The concert was GREAT, junior sounded just like his old man.It was one of the few concerts I've been to where there was no encore. (Perhaps Junior was not feeling well.) A week later, while talking to my wife on the phone, after the start of my hike, Ginny informed me that Frank Sinatra Jr. had suffered a massive fatal heart attack just 5 days after we saw him in concert. I've been giving that startling news a great deal of thought.If just a few more music legends cash in their chips a few days after Ginny & I see their concerts, Ginny and I could be getting paid a GREAT deal of money from the stars to AVOID their gigs.

However,I have been very, very lucky with weather so far.For the first 5 days, the weather was GREAT. It was warm, sunny, and temperatures ranged from the mid 70's to the mid 80's.In fact, it was so hot that I was drinking a gallon of water a day and hiking in shorts and a tshirt. The trees do not yet have leaves on them, but some low growing bushes have HUGE green buds on them that grow larger every day.Dogwoods, plum, and pear tress are very beautiful and in full bloom. On day 6, a cold front blew in. I reached the shelter where I planned to stay that night, and it was beginning to snow. There was a hiker hostel (Top of Georgia Hostel) just a few miles away, so I walked a few extra miles, to where the AT crossed the road, and the hostel van was waiting. I had no reservations, but it was possible to pitch my tent on the hostel grounds for a reduced fee. The wind still blew fiercely, and I still got snowed on, but due to the fact that I was 1000 feet lower than I would have been in the shelter up in the mountains, I escaped some of the cold. (A friend who camped that nite in the shelter said his water bottle froze solid.) At the hostel, we got just a dusting of snow. Two days ago, I got my first taste of rain, but it happened at nite.

Some of the names are hilarious. For example,one hiker smelled VERY bad, (due to no fault of his own, as he showered as often as it was possible for him to do so). His trail name was Ivan Odor. One fellow, who whined FAR too much, earned the trail name of Crybaby.

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525045,"At nite, in camp, we frequently have a campfire, and a great deal of socializing goes on around the campfire. There's just no telling what subject is going to get discussed. (one nite, we discussed bear poop.I kid you not.) The other nite, around the campfire, I said that a man who had hiked the entire AT the year before told some new hikers who were about to begin their AT hike that they could very quickly expect to lose their proper city manners, and by the end of the AT hike, they would CONSIDER eating out of dumpsters. I was very careful to emphasize that this habit would only be considered, not actually practiced. To my astonishment,I discovered that I was one of the few people standing around that campfire who had not (yet) indulged in this practice. I have very seldom been in a situation where I have been in the upper social crust of the group of people I hang out with, but this was one of those rare occasions. It did not take long for social snobbery to set in. As we sat around the campfire, drinking our water, I made sure my pinky finger was fully extended from my drinking cup as I sipped my water. I also affected a fake Boston Brahmin accent. I don't think I impressed any of the other campers, but I impressed the heck out of myself. William F. Buckley Jr. would have been mighty proud of me. Late that nite, in the privacy of my tent, I furitively wrote down the best places for dumpster diving in my journal. That way, should my financial situation take a turn for the worse, I'll know the best places to get dinner. In case you are wondering, the consensus of the group was that the dumpsters at Tim Horton restaurants are very fertile grounds for harvesting dinner. Starbucks and bakeries are not to be sneezed at either. One lady said that she dumpster dived at a potato chip factory.She had guests coming to a party,so she served them refreshments fresh from the dumpster.I desperately wanted to know where she got her potato chip dip, but I was afraid of what the answer might be.. Yesterday, a hiker told me an interesting story. Every year in May, there is a weekend party in Damascus, VA, where all the AT hikers get together to party and socialize. There was one middle aged man who had been basically living along the AT for 7-8 years, doing long sections of the trail, and just sort of lounging around when he wasn't hiking. He was a very social and amiable fellow.One day, a man who had hiked with this mysterious man for an extended period of time went home, turned on his tv, an watched an episode of ""America's Most Wanted."" There was a picture his amiable buddy on the tv set, with the notation that this man had embezzled 8 million dollars from Pepsi, and oh, by the way, there was a HUGE reward for information leading to the arrest of this man. So the amiable fellow who lived along the AT for many years found himself a new home behind bars, and another fellow found that he could afford to splurge as he hiked the AT. Happy Easter everybody. Yesterday, on 2 separate occasions, I was treated to Trail Magic, where trail angels presented me with colored, hard boiled Easter eggs.

Guess what city Baltimore Jack hails from? Give yourself 5 points if you said Boston. Also, his name is not Jack. Other than that, that trail name describes him perfectly. In January, my wife Ginny and I drove all the way to Franklin, N.C. to hear Baltimore Jack give a talk on how to prepare to hike the AT. So, imagine my surprise when I arrived at the hiker hostel in Franklin NC, and found Baltimore Jack there. One of Baltimore Jack's (BJ) parents is catholic, the other one is Jewish, so he said he felt he had permission to tell this slightly politically incorrect joke. Because I KNOW someone whose parents are Christian/Jewish, I feel I also have the proper moral authority to relay BJ's joke. On a cold, snowy January day, a Protestant minister and a Jewish Rabbi(both were wearing their appropriate religious garb) were traveling in opposite directions on a snowy, icy road. One of the vehicles hit a patch of black ice, spun out of control, and the 2 vehicles collided in a head on collision at 70 mph. Both cars were totaled, but miraculously, both men escaped without so much as a scratch. After ascertaining that they were both unhurt, the Protestant minister said, ""Rabbi, although we represent different religions, we both worship the same God. Our survival is nothing short of a miracle. Could I ask you to join me in a prayer of thanksgiving to our common God?"" The Rabbi said he thought that was a fine idea. So the 2 men knelt in the snow, and the minister launched into a very long winded prayer of thanksgiving. But instead of using the word ""God"" in his prayer, the minister slyly inserted the word ""Jesus"" in its place. The wise and kindly Rabbi said nothing, merely bowing his head in silence. When the prayer was concluded, the Rabbi asked if the minister would be interested in participating in a Jewish thanksgiving ritual. ""I'd be delighted,"" responded the minister. The Rabbi then took out a bottle of Jewish wine from his totaled vehicle and explained that it was a Jewish tradition to drink wine to offer thanks to God for his blessing. The minister then took a small sip of wine, and tried to hand the bottle to his host. ""No, no, no,"" exhorted the Rabbi. ""God has not granted us a small favor, but a very great miracle, therefore, in order to not offend God, we must drink deeply to express our gratitude for God's great miracle."" Not wanting to offend Jewish traditions, the minister guzzled half the bottle, then tried to hand the bottle to the Rabbi, who shook his head ruefully. ""I'm puzzled, Rabbi,"" said the minister. ""You did not hesitate to pray with me, yet you are declining to participate in your own Jewish custom. Why is that?"" ""The police will be here in just a few minutes,"" replied the Rabbi.

So, I found a nearly level spot on top of the ridge, and pitched my tent there. The problem with pitching a tent away from the wind protected area of the shelter is that wind can be very strong on top of the ridge, and shortly after it got dark, the wind picked up a great deal.

To avoid that, I decided to be proactive & move my tent in the dark to the safety of being near the shelter. So in the dark, I took down my tent, and carried it down to the shelter. To my horror, when I got down to the shelter, I discovered that I had somehow lost my tent groundcloth. I feared it blew away in the strong wind. To my relief, I found the groundcloth.

It got very cold last night, and a half inch of snow fell. I put on almost every stitch of clothing I had, and it was enough to keep me warm. My second milestone reached is that I have now hiked over 200 miles, which means that in a measly 2,000 miles, I will reach the end of the AT","Derrick Knob

I hiked 5 miles, and as luck would have it, I was just in time to catch the one and only free shuttle into town (Gatlinburg, TN). I promised myself that when I got to town, I would treat myself to a steak dinner. I honored that promise with a visit to Texas Roadhouse. I ordered the largest steak they had (smothered with grilled onions & mushrooms, of course) a baked potato, (smothered with cheese, bacon bits & sour cream) and a green salad. I had plans for a pie & ice cream dessert, but I was so full, I couldn't do it. I took a dogie bag home, and that will be my supper. Nero days are VERY busy for me, because I need to write in my trail journal, resupply with food,do laundry, etc. Tomorrow, it's back on the AT.

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527074,"Nero (near zero) days are always a bit frantic for me, as I hike for part of that day, then I have many chores to complete, prior to resuming my hike the next morning. Gatlinburg TN is a tourist trap just outside Smoky Mt. Natl. Park (the most visited park in the US)Usually, I have enough time to do all of my chores on a nero day, but in Gatlinburg, the grocery store is a few miles out of town, and I needed to take 4 different trolleys to get to & from the store, and the trolleys come infrequently, so I burned up several hours doing my shopping. Nevertheless, the next morning, at 10:00 A.M, I was all set to take the free shuttle back to the AT. However, a brutal cold snap blew in, and park rangers were warning of a wind chill index of below zero for the next 2 days, so I booked 2 more days at the hotel. I was glad I did this, because the hotel (one of only 2 cheap hotels in town) very quickly booked out, with frantic hikers coming off the AT. There are 2 groups of people hiking the AT: 1) young people in their late teens to early 20's, and old fogeys (such as myself) in their late 50's -60's. Surprisingly, these 2 groups get along very well together, as we have a common goal (hiking the AT) If you want to know the latest info as to where trail magic can be found, best places to resupply, upcoming events, etc., ask a young person.) So last nite, while buying a 6 pack of hard cider, I ran into a young person who invited me to a party. I accepted his invitation, but with a little misgiving, because I felt a little out of place at a young person's party. So I invited an old fogey AT hiking friend (his trail name is Marmalade) He is a retired construction worker from England. It was an interesting party. There were 6 guys renting a room, and they were all excited by an upcoming music festival in a week in the town of Hot Springs, which is a resupply town on the AT. Hot Springs is renowned for its natural thermal springs, so I will take a rest day there. I stayed at the party until 10:30 PM, and then went to bed. There is one other big difference between the old fogeys & the kids. The old fogeys go to bed shortly after it gets dark, while the kids tend to stay up later, visiting around the campfire. The old fogeys get up at dawn, and leave as soon as they get packed up. The kids sleep in for a few hours, leaving camp as late as 11:00 AM, several hours after the old fogeys. A few hours later, the kids breeze past the old fogeys, and arrive at camp well before the old folks. I totter very slowly up and down the steep inclines, breathing & snorting like a freight train. The young folks scamper up and down the steep ascents/descents like mountain goats, chattering happily as they breeze past this wheezing old man. (sigh) The sad thing is, I can remember when I was a young person breezing past all those old fogeys.","Newfound Gap/Gatlinburg, TN

However, after 1 rest day, I am eager to get back on the trail again. Today, I am a bit bored. I weighed my pack yesterday. Fully loaded with 3 days food & 2 quarts of water, my pack weighs 35 pounds. Two common mistakes people make when hiking the AT is to 1) forget their hiking poles 2) hiking the wrong way on the AT. So far, I have only once nearly forgotten my hiking poles, and that was a day when I got out of a hiker hostel van, and nearly forgot my hiking poles. Hiking poles are not cheap, so I don't want to lose mine. (Hiking without hiking poles is extremely hard on the knees.) The AT is marked by rectangular white paint markings (blazes) painted on trees/rocks. The AT runs north to south, or south to north. When a person arrives at a camping shelter for the nite, it is very important to note whether he/she needs to go left or right the next morning when resuming the hike. Otherwise, you may find yourself hiking the same terrain you hiked the day before. Many years ago, a blind man named Bill Irwin hiked the entire AT. One day, a young college student, feeling sorry for poor blind Bill Irwin, volunteered to hike with Bill for the day. After they had hiked for a short distance, Bill Irwin gently told his benefactor that they were heading in the wrong direction. Mr. Irwin knew this because he could feel the sun shining on the wrong side of his face! Mr. Irwin said he felt a secret triumph in being able to tell his sighted friend of his (the young man's) error.

Overnite, the slush refroze back into a shield of solid ice, and there was LOTS of downhill walking. My eyes were on the ice on the trail at all times. Occasionally, a tree blows down across the AT. Volunteers come by with chain saws and clear these trees off the trail. However, there are always a few trees lying across the AT that the volunteers have not gotten to yet. Usually, these trees arte lying on the ground, and easy to spot. However, one tree was lying across the trail, at forehead height. As a result of looking at the ground at the ice, I did not see this tree. CONK. I hit my forehead on that tree.Fortunately, because I was moving very slowly, I did not hit my head very hard. All of us old folks moved very slowly and carefully down the treacherous icy path. The young people scampered quickly and happily down the trail, and they never slipped as we old fogeys did. They thought it was great fun, and we old folks hated them for that Today I think that hitting my head was funny. When it happened, I said a few things that I would not have said had I been in church. At lunch (many of us stop in a camping spot to have lunch and to socialize) I told my fellow old fogeys that I had hit my forehead on a tree, and one by one all of the old folks said the same thing had happened to them too. There was one young kid eating lunch with us. He said nothing at all, and we did not ask him if he had also hit his forehead on the tree. We did not have to. The poor kid had a HUGE knot on his forehead. He was scampering happily down the icy mountainside at full speed when his forehead met the tree! After the kid left, one of my old fart buddies suggested that we call the kid the unicorn in recognition of the huge knot on his forehead. I know it is not nice to rejoice in another persons misfortune, and we old folks really do like the young kids a lot, but we are so jealous of their ability to move so much more quickly and agilely than us that we can not help but take some secret guilty pleasure when fate occasionally hands them the short end of the stick!","Pecks Corner Shelter

Seeing that I had a 5 mile 2400 foot mountain to climb, that seemed like pretty good advice to me, but I continued onward. (Following my climb, I then had a 1400 foot descent, so even though I only hiked 7.5 miles, it was a very tough day. So much for the thought of easier hiking once I got out of the Smokies! Anyway, todays title is Olie Olson. I was a Boy Scout when I was a kid. The most revered and respected man in the Boy Scouts where I grew up (the suburbs of Chicago) was an elderly Norwegian man named Olie Olson. Olie was greatly admired because he knew the name of damn near every plant, bush, or tree that grew in the forest. There were many miles of horse trails that went through the woods near my house. As a kid, I was on my high school cross country & track teams and me and some of my friends used to jog for miles through those horse trails through the woods. Every spring, for just a few weeks, the floor of the woods would erupt into the most beautiful wild flowers in every color of the rainbow. It was one of the most impressive things I have ever seen. The Boy Scouts have awards called merit badges for almost any subject you can think of. I wanted to get the botany merit badge, but I needed to identify a minimum of 50 plants in order to get this merit badge, far more plants than I knew. The man who could award this merit badge was Olie Olson. I was so in awe of him that I almost did not phone him, but finally I got up[ my courage and called him and said that I wanted to earn this merit badge, but I needed him to take me through the woods and first teach me to identify these flowers. There was a long silence at the other end of the phone, and then Olie said he would be delighted to do this for me. So for the next few weeks, Olie and I strolled for miles through the woods, with him teaching me to identify far, far more than 50 plants. I have never met anyone like Olie Olson. He told me a great deal about his life, and he had suffered far more misfortune than most people, yet he had somehow found a way to be at peace with the world, and deeply grateful for every blessing in his life. Well, the appointed day came, and Olie and I strolled through the forest, and I identified far more than 50 plants, and Olie Olson said I was qualified to earn the botany merit badge. He then announced that although he (Olie) had been the botany merit badge counselor for 20 years, I was only the second person to qualify for it. The first person was Olies son, who was tragically killed by a drunk driver. The reason I am talking about Olie Olson is because it is now mid-April in the North Carolina forest, and the forest floor is an absolute RIOT of wildflowers of every size and color in the rainbow, and I can not help but think of my teacher, Olie Olson","Standing Bear Hikerv Hostel

I always scoffed at that sensationalism, but I am now a believer, because I have personally met and spoken to Amelia Earhart. Not only is Amelia still alive, she is actually a few years younger than she was when her plane disappeared several decades ago! And yes, Amelia does indeed have red hair. I stopped niking briefly to take a picture with my camera when I was overtaken by an attractive female hiker (with red hair.) We chatted and I asked her what her trail name was. Amelia Earhart, she replied, Amelia is a retired first sargent (27 years) in the air force. She was deployed to Afghanistan, and the war has left many mental scars on her. Several years ago, an ex-Marine captain whose first name is Sean walked the entire AT in a successful attempt to alleviate some of the effects of PTSD that he was suffering due to his deployments to Iraq/Afghanistan. It worked so well for him that he founded a nonprofit organization called ""Warrior Hikers."" This is the fourth year of the organization. There are 10 ex-servicemen/women doing the AT through this organization this year. The organization gets no govt, funding. They give members $300 a month for food, and outfitters have donated backpacking equipment. The AT passes near several small towns, and if those towns have a VFW or American Legion chapter, these hikers pay them a visit and are feted with dinner, drinks and a hotel for the night. Warrior Hikers are now also hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, the Continental Divide Trail, and several other shorter hikes, plus doing the Trans-America Bicycle Trail. Amelia Earhart is one of the 10 hikers doing the At this year. I am a (peacetime) veteran myself, and I salute Sean and everyone else who is helping vets suffering from PTSD to readjust. From what I have read about PTSD, I would not wish it on my worst enemy. And now, if I may be permitted to climb on my soapbox for just a minute, I have always felt that the slogan ""Support our Troops"" has been perverted. In my mind, the BEST way we can support our troops is to not deploy them to foreign countries where even a decent military victory is a long shot at best, especially when those foreign countries pose no threat to the security of the US.

On 4/17, I hiked 11.0 miles, from Hot Springs, TN to Spring Mt. Shelter, and yesterday, I had my longest & toughest day. I hiked 15.4 miles from Spring Mt. Shelter to Jerrys Cabin Shelter. The hike was tough for a couple of reasons. 1) It was a very hot day yesterday. 2) I climbed 2400 feet 3) Some of the trail was very rocky, which makes for slow going. There will be over 5000 people attempting to hike the AT this year. That may sound like mobs of people, but the truth of the matter is that I see an average of 10 people on a typical day. At times, the woods are utterly and completely silent. I am talking about a total lack of any sound whatsoever. That total silence can last for 1-2 hours. Most of the time, the woods are nearly silent. I hear only the chirping of birds, the buzzing of insects, and an occasional woodpecker (bird) drilling into a tree. That extreme silence can put me into a deep daydream. I was in such a deep daydream yesterday when I startled a wild turkey. His/her frantic wingbeats slapping against his body as he beat a hasty retreat sounded like gunshots. Maybe the deep silence put the turkey into a daydream as well. I do not know who was more startled; me or the wild turkey. I need to bring my non-O2K readers up to speed for what I am about to say. O2K was a year long bike trip that I did with 250 other people. Some of the most dedicated folks not only rode every single mile for the entire year, they even rode on rest days. A small group of people rode over 20, 000 miles that year. I was not in that select group. On the AT, there are people who are determined to hike every single INCH of the AT. I am not in this group either. There are 3 ways for an AT hiker to lose respect among the purists. 1) ""Yellow blazing."" This means to find a place where the AT crosses a paved road, and hitchhike for however many miles a person wants to avoid hiking on the AT. I have not yellow blazed, and hopefully I will not yellow blaze. 2)""Blue Blazing"" The entire AT is extremely challenging, but a few parts are off the charts tough. When this happens, the hiker is offered a short blue blaze hike to avoid the extrememly difficult part. The first time I had a blue blaze option, I naively declined my ""get out of jail free"" opportunities. I ascended 400 feet in .4 of a mile. I learned my lesson. Yesterday there was a blue blaze opportunity due to ""an extremely rocky & difficult"" section. I have hiked sections that were EXTREMELY character building, and they did not merit this category, so I figured this 1.5 mile section must be off the charts, so I blue blazed it. The people who took the challenging route told me they regretted it. 3) Slackpacking. This means a hiker hikes with only a very small rucksack, containing 1-2 meals and drinking water. Somebody hauls the hikers full backpack in a car, and drops it off in a place where the hiker can retrieve it. I have slackpacked 1 day, for 15 miles, but I intend to do quite a bit more slackpacking, especially when I get to New Hampshire & Maine","Laughing Heart Hiker Hostel

I was so beat that it was an effort to set up my tent, and cook and eat dinner, chores I normally relish. In my tent that night, I had to give myself a pep talk about how all AT hikers have very tough days. Yesterday, I reached 300- miles of hiking. I also got my first blister of the trip, which is not bad for 300 miles of hiking. I was the recipient of some trail magic yesterday. A middle aged couple handed out zuccini loafs to hikers. These were HUGE loafs. I had some for dinner last night, and some for both breakfast & lunch. The lady who gave me the treat warned me to watch out for rattlesnakes sunning themselves on the rocks. That sure got my attention! I kept a close lookout for rattlers, but thankfully, they made themselves scarce. It was a lucky thing. That zuccini bread was off the charts delicious, and I was damned if I was going to share it with a rattlesnake! Today, I was very sluggish as I hiked, and I think it was because I got dehydrated. When I arrived at camp yesterday, my throat was so dry I literally could not swallow. Today I have made a conscious effort to drink lots of water, and it seems to be working. I heard an interesting story the other day. In an earlier post, I told how a snowstorm had left the AT icy & treacherous. One lady was at Clingmans Dome (the highest point on the entire AT. It is in Great Smoky Mt. Natl. Park.) She slipped on the ice, fell on her forehead, and opened up a gash that was bleeding profusely. She attempted to staunch the blood flow with snow. This only worked up to a point. So an ever resourceful AT hiker whipped out his superglue (I kid you not) and glued the wound shut. A few days later the glue fell off, revealing a scab underneath! The lady who told this story remarked that she did not know if her superglue belonged in her repair kit or her first aid kit.

There are certain moments on the AT that are so significant, they are almost holy. Then there are moments that are beyond even holy. These are sacred moments. The most sacred moment of all on the AT is when an AT hiker receives his/her trail name, usually due to some disasterous event that occurs to the unfortunate person. I was priviliged to witness an AT hiker's christening, (and I DO mean christening.) I had just left the Paradise Hiker Hostel and was walking alone through the peace of the early morning Tennessee woods. I came across a sign begging hikers to please throw rocks and sticks at any dogs who approched them, because it is the custom of rural Tennessee dog owners to let their dogs run free through the woods, and the dogs follow hikers for miles, and are then lost to owners. The sign said that one dog owner had lost 6 dogs in one year due to this. (If I lost 6 dogs in one year, it would have occurred to me that allowing my dogs to run free through the woods all day might not be swuch a good idea, but perhaps that is just my big city outlook.) Shortly after reading this sign, I heard a noise behind me. I turned around to spot the second largest dog I have ever seen walking right behind me. It was a pure white, very beautiful Pyrennes dog. I was startled, but it was soon apparent that the dog meant me no harm. The dog continued to follow me, and I soon passed a ""stealth camp"" (an un official campsite along the AT) occupied by 2 young men. As hikers are allowed to bring dogs on the AT, the two young men assumed the dog, which wandered away from me, and into their camp, belonged to me. One of the young men asked if it was ok for him to pet my dog.I told him that since the dog was not mine, I saw no problem with him petting it. He then began petting the dog, and talking to it in a very friendly tone. Shortly afterwards, the young man who had been speaking so affectionately to the dog began cursing the animal and ordering it to vacate the campsite it a VERY harsh, no nonsense voice. The puzzled dod very quickly ran off. The other young man was doubled over, helplessly convulsing in shrieks of uncontrolled laughter. At first, I assumed the animal had stolen some food. (The young victim could only WISH he had gotten off so easily.) No, what happened was that the huge dog spotted the young man's pack leaning against a tree on the ground, trotted over to the backpack, sniffed it, liked what he smelled, lifted his hind leg, and proceeded to hose down my unfortunate friend's backpack. Remember, this dod was HUGE, and a huge dog has a huge bladder as well. And that, my friends is how ""Giant Pee"" got his trail name. Here is something else to consider: When the unfortunate event occurred, the two young men, who are best friends, had decidedly different reactions. The victim felt violated, and terribly angry. His friend, who suffered no unpleasant affects, was HOWLING with uncontrollable laughter.

The two hiker hostels have an arrangement where any person who will carry a 5 pound rock that has the name of one of the hostels on it for the 70 miles between the 2 hostels will receive a free one night stay ( a $20 value)at the hostel, plus the plucky (and stupid) hiker will also receive the honor of having his/her name added to the rock with a black magic marker. When I told this story to another AT hiker, that man said that it would be very easy for a person to go to the post office in one town, and mail the rock to him/herself in the next town. I thought I was the only one twisted enough to have considered this way of beating the system!","Sams Gap

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529437,"My blister was still bothering me, and I discovered that I had not one, but two blisters on my heel. After I punctured and drained the second blister, I began to feel better. Having a blister caused me to favor my other leg, and now the thigh on my favored leg is very sore. Tomorrow will be a low mileage day, followed by a zero day (no hiking), so hopefully my blister problem will soon be gone. My incredible luck of hiking on the AT with no rain days came to an end today. (Most AT hikers will tell you that if they have to choose between being rained on or snowed on, they would rather be snowed on, because snow will not soak you to the skin, like rain will. As of today, I agree.) In an earlier post, I said that one of my worst fears was having to use the bathroom in the woods during a driving rainstorm, due to what a great volume of rainwater will very quickly do to toilet paper. Today I got a dress rehersal (I won't use the expression ""dry run"") for that event. It was raining steadily when I got an urgent message from ""Mother Nature."" To most of you, a roll of toilet paper is probably nothing special. To me, each sheet of toilet paper is a sacred document, which must be kept dry, AT ALL COSTS. As such, these ""sacred documents"" are housed in a ziplock plastic bag, along with my digging trowel and a small container of hand sanitizer. However, during a rainstorm, the toilet paper must come out of the plastic bag for a brief period of time in order to be used. That is problem number one. The literature on using the woods properly as a bathroom says that a persom needs to use his/her trowel to dig a hole 6-8 inches deep to use to dispose of both waste and toilet paper. On paper (no pun intended) this sounds like a good strategy. In reality, it is a little bit different. When you begin to dig the hole, you very quickly discover that the forest floor is a vast, inerlocking system of rocks and roots, and you begin to wish that you had a stick of dynamite, rather than a measly trowel. That is problem number two. However, desperation wins out, and none too soon, you have blasted a hole into the forest floor. Now the real challenge begins. Are you skilled enough and fast enough to unroll and use the toilet paper before the driving rain turns it into a soggy, useless pile of sludge?? Mother Nature felt sorry for me, and the rain was only moderate, so I passed the test with flying colors. This episode taught me two lessons: 1) Reality is usually less grim than one's fears. 2) In an emergency, a person is usually faster/more efficient than he/she thought. The next morning, I was at a shelter, when Nature again called. In a previous post, I said I considered a shelter with a privy to be decadent luxury. Regrettably, the park service has decided they are pampering hikers too much, so for the next 140 miles, shelters will not have privies. However, the park service folks have at least a little mercy, so in loo (sorry, I couldn't resist the pun) of a privy, they have given each shelter a full sized shovel. My deffinition of decadent luxury has once again been knocked down a notch. My new deffinition of decadent luxury is a shovel and a lack of rain. So, armed with a full sized shovel, I headed out to seek revenge against the rocks/roots that had challenged my puny trowel the day before. I jumped very aggressively on the shovel. It moved only a few inches into the forest floor. The rocks/roots were not giving up without a fight. However, my full sized shovel was no match for the rocks/ rtoots, and in a few seconds time, I had dug a hole deep enough to bring a smile to the face of even the strictest forest ranger. I LOVE shovels!","Bald Mountain Shelter

My goal was to get as far as possible while it was dry. I was blessed with weather that was both dry & cool, PERFECT hiking weather that lasted the entire downhill walk into town. All week long, I have been looking forward to the free picnic a local Baptist church has been promising the hikers. These WONDERFUL people did not provide a picnic; they provided a FEAST. Hot dogs, hamburgers, the BEST baked beans I have ever eaten, green beans, pasta, and about twenty different delicious desserts. All for free. We hikers were so grateful, we thanked the church people over and over again. The party was from noon to five PM. The church people told us we were welcome to return a second time for dinner. I fully intended to do so, but my stomach has shrunk, and I had no appetite for dinner! I stepped on the hostel scale. It said I weighed 145 pounds. HA!

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529779,"It is an irony, but zero days(i.e. rest days)are far more stressful for me than hiking days, due to the fact that I have so many chores to do prior to getting back on the trail. It rained the day before I got to the hiker hostel, and I did not have a chance to dry out my ground cloth, tent, or sleeping bag. All were wet to one degree or another, and they were starting to smell really bad (then again, I hadn't had a shower in several days, so maybe it was ME, and not my gear exuding that foul stench.) My hunch was that both myself and my gear were contributing more than our fair share to the funk machine, so I tied a piece of rope between 2 trees and dried out my tent, sleeping bag, and ground cloth, and took a scalding hot shower (I never actually got INTO the shower, but the water was turned on as hot as it would go. I hope the steam did me some good!) I then went into town and bought food for the next leg of my hike. I also had to do laundry. There is only one washing machine at the hiker hostel, and MOBS of people staying here, so I waited most of the day, until it was FINALLY my turn. While waiting for my laundry to finish, I glanced down at my right foot (where I had punctured and drained a blister a few days ago) and was horrified to discover that my foot was an angry red color, and my foot was so swollen that I could barely see my ankle. I was scheduled to return to the AT this morning. Instead, I paid a visit to the urgent care center, where the doctor confirmed my fears. I have an infection. The doctor told me I can't hike until Thursday morning. He also gave me 10 days worth of antibiotics, and told me to keep my foot elevated. So I am staring at my foot, trying to will the swelling/diecoloration away, but I guess that is the job of the antibiotics. I really relish a zero day, but when the zero day is finished, I am also happy to be back on the AT again. The next 2 days are going to be very boring for me.","Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel.

I went to the urgent care center yesterday. The doctor prescribed sulphantibiotics. I got 10 days worth, and I am to take 2 doses per day. I started taking my medicine yesterday, and saw no improvement. When I woke up this morning and looked at my foot, I was very pleasantly surprised. The discoloration and the swelling are nearly gone. Wow! I LOVE the job this medicine is doing for me. I will be sure to continue taking the medicine until it is gone. There is a HUGE difference between my one year, around the world bicycle trip (O2K) and hiking the AT. On O2K, there were 250 people, who all had the same daily destination 70-100 miles down the road. We all took the same route, so all day long you met your traveling companions either riding with them, passing them, or being passed by them. There wasn't a single day where I wasn't highly motivated and happy to be there. The AT is ENTIRELY different. I am a group of one. I started out with a group of people, but over a period of several weeks, most of them are now ahead of me, or they have dropped out. Every day, I have to make a decision as to how far I will travel that day. At first, I decided I would stay only at campsites that had a ""shelter"" (a 3 walled, with one side exposed to the elements sleeping shed). My reason for this is because although I sleep in my tent, and not the shelters, these campsites have/had ""bear cables"" where I could hang my food bag to protect my food from being eaten by an animal at night while I sleep. The other advantage to ""shelters"" is that they used to have a privy, so I didn't have to use my trowel. The ddisadvantage to shelter campsites is that they are haphazardly located. Sometimes they are either so close together or so far apart that it means either a very short hiking day for me, or a very long hiking day for me. As the shelters will not have either bear cables or privies for many, many miles, there is no longer a clear advantage to using them, and I will now choose any campsite that is approximately the distance I want to hike that day, provided it has a reliable source of water. The biggest difference between O2K and the AT is that on O2K there was a HUGE group of us all traveling together & encouraging one another. On the AT, I chat with the people who hike past me, or the people I am camping with that night, but then we all go our separate ways in the morning. I have a few sheets of laminated paper with inspiring thoughts written on them that I read to myself every night to keep my motivation up. On the AT, if a person doesn't frequently self motivate, he/she may find a reason to drop out. The other BIG difference between O2K and the AT is that (in my opinion) the AT is FAR harder then O2K. (Personally, it is the toughest thing I have ever attempted.) I have heard that two O2K cyclists, Art & Lynn have hiked the AT. If this is true, I would be interested to know which event was more physically & mentally challenging for them (Of course, Art & Lynn are in such phenominal physical condition that they may have found BOTH events to be relatively easy.)

However, the tent walls were soaked, and my sleeping bag touched the tent walls, so the end of the sleeping bag was slightly wet. Also, a few of my clothes got wet. The moral of this story is that one day/night of rain will not result in gear getting wet if you are careful. With each additional day of rain, more and more of your stuff gets wet, no matter how careful you are. My most important piece of gear in terms of needing to be dry is my sleeping bag.

As you might expect, today involved some climbing. I climbed 3000 feet in total. The first part of the climb was not so bad, as the AT corkscrewed around the mountain. The second half of the climb was very strenuous, and it would have been worse if someone hadn't warned me that there was a false summit (you think you are done climbing, but you still have a hell of a long way to go.) The weather forecast predicted rain by 5:00 PM. I arrived at the shelter at 3:30, set up my tent ( I don't sleep in shelters if I can avoid them, as some of them are overrun with mice, which crawl all over you at night when you are trying to sleep.) At 5;30, we could hear thunder in the distance, and very cool looking wisps of fog floated through the campsite. Shortly after 7:00 PM, the rain started. I really enjoy the sound of rain hitting my tent, just as long as I am inside the tent when it happens. It rained all night long. I got lucky, and the rain stopped by morning, so I was able to take down my tent and have breakfast with no rain. Shortly before I arrived at the shelter, I passed a stone chimney, standing by itself right next to the AT. It was all that remains of a luxury hotel that was in business from 1884-1924. It was called the Cloudland Hotel. Each room had a bathtub and hot water, an unheard of luxury for the times. Three sumptuous meals were included in the price of your stay. It cost two dollars to stay for one night, or ten dollars for a week, or thirty dollars for a month. The hotel was exactly on the Tennessee/North Carolina border. A green line ran the length of the hotel, so you knew at all times whether you were in Tennessee or North Carolina. This distinction was important ONLY in the hotel bar, because drinking was legal in Tennessee, but not North Carolina.

On the AT, you constantly either climb up or down a mountain. I wanted to get as low as possible as quickly as possible, but the AT had other ideas. As the rain BEAT down on me, and the wind howled, I began to ascend a VERY steep mountain. The AT turned into a river of very fast moving water, moving down the mountain I was climbing. I was soaked, and a little bit freaked out. Fortunately, I was prepared. It was raining, but that was ok, because I was wearing my swimming suit. I am not joking. In fact, I have walked over 400 miles of the AT, and I have worn my swimsuit every step of the way. I do this for two reasons: 1) My swimsuit is made of a synthetic fiber, which dries very quickly. 2) Wearing a swimsuit has allowed me to avoid the problem of chafing of my legs. There are times when there is no other place in the world that I would rather be than on the AT (except possibly Hawaii). This rainstorm was NOT one of those times.

Then the steady rain became a drizzle, and then the rain stopped altogether, and believe it or not, the sun came out, and the clouds parted to reveal blue sky.

My computer skills are minimal at best. While attempting to post yesterday's entry, I somehow got locked out, so today's post will tell what happened both yesterday and today. Yesterday, I had a very short day, (7.5 miles) due to the fact that the shelter I intended to stay at (Watauga Lake Shelter) was closed due to negative bear/hiker encounters. The shelter had been closed for the past 2 years due to this problem, then reopened briefly again this year, then reclosed, due to a recurrence of the bear problem. The rumor mill says that some local people who were bored and wanted to create a little excitement deliberately left large quantities of dog food at the shelter in order to bring the bears back. I do not know if there is any truth to this rumor. A four mile stretch of the AT, from US321 to Wilbur Dam Road was closed to overnight camping. It has been deemed safe for hikers to hike through during daylight hours. When I walked through that area, I felt a little uneasy, but saw no evidence of bears. My original plan was to pay $15 to camp at a public camping ground located just before the 4 mile area closed to camping, but I guess a little bit of the AT hiker mentality of ""why should I pay to camp when I can stealth camp for free?"" crept in, so I found a stealth camp just before US 321 (it did not have a water source or a privy) and pitched my tent. Some people get careless and do not store their food bag from a rope hanging from a tree overnite while they sleep. They use their food bag as a pillow for their head at night. There are stories of bears ripping done tents to get at the food they can smell inside. With stories of rampaging bears just a few miles away, I was very careful to store my food from a rope in a tree while I slept. A day earlier, a hiker told me that one of the most revered and colorful characters among AT hikers, Baltimore Jack, a man who had through hiked the entire AT (2,200 miles) eight times, had died suddenly of congestive heart failure at age 53. As I had seen Baltimore Jack only a month earlier, and as he seemed to be ok, this came as quite a surprise to me. He was a very well loved and respected man, and he will be greatly missed. The next morning, I hiked 9.1 miles to Vandeventer Shelter. My guidebook said there was a picnic place, with a flush toilet and a drinking fountain just a mile from where I had stealth camped the night before. As I had an urgent need for the flush toilet, as well as a need to replenish my drinking water, I hurried to the spot. I considered myself to be living high off the hog when I reached the indoor plumbing facility: a very rare double luxury of a flush toilet, plus a drinking fountain, which meant I did not have to filter my water prior to drinking it. While I THOROUGHLY enjoyed my visit to the flush toilet, I got a big surprise when I drank the water from the drinking fountain. I did not like the taste of the water I was drinking, and I realized the unpleasant taste was due to the chlorine in the water. When you drink chlorinated water every day, you get used to the taste of chlorine. However, for several weeks, I had been drinking water I filtered from streams, and myself and other hikers have decided it is some of the best tasting water we have ever drank. I did not expect that I would come to prefer filtered stream water over chlorinated water.","Stealth Camp Near Hampton, TN

Every time the AT crosses a road, my hopes begin to rise, because roads are often the places where hikers encounter ""trail magic"", (food/drinks left by kind people known as ""trail angels."" So, I came to a road, and I saw a 1984 Volkswagen Vanagan, covered with the kinds of bumper stickers that you often see on trail angels cars. More promising still, there was a fellow exiting that vehicle wearing a t-shirt that said ""Riff Raff"" on it. Ah, even more promising, as Riff Raff is a club of trail angels. However, after I exchanged pleasantries with the Riff Raff owner of the Vanagan, he shouldered a backpack and began hiking along the AT. I incorrectly assumed he was doing a day hike. I continued along the AT and discovered that the AT can legitimately claim that part of it (the AT) is wheelchair accessible. Yep, it may be only half a mile, but I was walking along a half mile stretch of the AT that is wheelchair accessible. As I crested a hill, the roof of a party tent came into view, with lots of people seated in chairs, eating snacks and drinking beverages. It was some trail magic set up by Riff Raff for AT hikers. It turned out that this was both good news and bad news, all at the same time. As I approached their tent, a member of Riff Raff shouted out, ""here comes an AT hiker. Let's make him feel welcome."" One person helped me take off my backpack, and I was offered free beverages (both alcoholic, and nonalcoholic) and snacks, with a promise that free chili would soon be available. There was a HUGE group of AT hikers there. Some of them had been at the site for over 24 hours. They had arrived the night before, when Riff Raff first arrived at that place, gotten good and drunk, pitched their tents on the spot, spent the night, and were again very drunk the next day. I was given a string of green plastic beads to wear around my neck, and a rainbow colored plastic wristband that said Riff Raff on it. I was also handed a Bloody Mary, complete with a giant stalk of celery sticking out of it. The person who made my Bloody Mary also put in some horseradish...LOTS of horseradish. I have somewhat of a delicate stomach and I cannot tolerate spicy foods, so after just a few sips of my Bloody Mary, I had a violent hiccup attack, and had to set my drink aside. (If you find yourself in a crowd of serious drinkers, not finishing a drink is a SERIOUS offense.) On St. Patrick's Day, back in March, a few days after I first began my AT hike, I encountered some Trail Magic by a group of people who were camping out. These people were both hikers, and followers of a rock band called the Grateful Dead. At 10;30 AM, they were feeling no pain. Their slogan was ""if your goal is to drink all day long, you need to get an early start."" To their credit, they did not pressure us to stay longer than we wished to stay with them after we ate the free food they offered us. When trail angels set up trail magic, hikers sit around eating and chatting for no more than an hour at most, and then continue their hike. Riff Raff believes that the AT is a dual use hiking trail, with equal parts of both hiking and partying. They believe hikers should attend their trail magic events for a MINIMUM of 24 hours. We didn't know that when we accepted their hospitality. In the 1970's, a rock band called the Eagles put out a song called Hotel California. One of the lyrics to that song says ""you can check out any time you want, but you can never leave."" Every time a hiker attempted to resume their hike, everyone from Riff Raff would very loudly protest and put a very heavy guilt trip on the person trying to leave. If a hiker stays at a Riff Raff event for several days (this sometimes happens) it is not a problem. Riff Raff will then ""yellow blaze"" (transport them by car) to a spot on the AT where they can rejoin their friends I began to have very mixed feelings about Riff Raff. On one hand, they all pitch in large amounts of their own money to provide free food/beverages for hikers, and I am deeply grateful for that. However, I could have done without the guilt trip when I resumed my hike. I wish I had been the late poet laureate of the US, Robert Frost. I would have stood up, and in a scholarly voice proclaimed, ""The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, but I have promises to keep. And miles to walk before I sleep."" However, being a simple hiker, I, and three other people did the practical thing. We patiently waited for our opportunity, and when a large group of new victims (I mean hikers) arrived, and Riff Raff was busy welcoming them to their spider web, we jumped to our feet and snuck out of their camp.","Vandeventer Shelter

There are two states in the US that are named after prominent Americans. One of them is Washington (state) which is named after our first president. The other state is Virginia, which is named after my wife. (My wife (Virginia) reads every one of my trail journal entries, and if this doesn't get me brownie points with her, nothing will.)

If you cross Double Ax Murderer, he may have cause to change his trail name to Triple Ax Murderer) There is a forum called White Blaze where people who are contemplating a hike on the AT can go to pick up tips and advice. Some of that advice is excellent. Some of the things you read on White Blaze is hilariously wrong. Here is an example of that. I recently met a homeless man (I'll call him Bob) who decided to hike the AT because he was told 1) The AT is paved the entire way 2) The AT is on level/flat ground the entire way.

I noticed that the lowest strap on my backpack, my waist belt, seemed to be very low, but I figured that wearing my waist belt around my knees made me ""hip"", just like the kids who wear their belts around their knees. I figured I was a gangsta hiker. When the pain in my back got nearly unbearable, I did the unthinkable: I asked a young twenty something kid if my backpack was adjusted properly. ""Well no, you are wearing your backpack much too low and loosely,"" he diplomatically stated. He then spent about 10 seconds adjusting the straps on my backpack. It was like somebody threw a light switch. The pain in my back miraculously disappeared. A few minutes later, my back gave a contented sigh.

Warren is a self described anarchist. Warren believes that as long as he is not hurting anyone, he should be allowed to do as he pleases. As an example, he cited violating a rule that forbade people from camping overnight on a certain mountaintop. Warren said that while he was fully sympathetic to the reasons this law had been passed, (people were spray painting the rocks/trees, getting drunk and breaking bottles in the campsite), Warren had no intention of doing any of those things, therefore, the prohibition against overnight camping at that spot did not apply to him. We also attended a very moving talk by a 69 year old Viet Nam vet who is walking the AT to combat the PTSD he has been suffering since 1970.

He had flowers painted on his forehead. He was wearing bright red lipstick, and he had a full beard. He had a very feminine walk, and he was carrying a champagne glass with him, that he kept filling with a beverage he had hidden in a brown paper bag.

As I sit in the library, I am getting a VERY powerful sense of deja vu. When I was in college, I worked part time in the city public library. One of our most reliable patrons was a nice old man who suffered from mental problems that I suspect were biological in nature, and certainly not his fault. He was a harmless fellow who seldom bathed, and he had a very pronounced odor. Many of the other library patrons gave this man a wide berth. I had planned to ""zero"" (take a day off) in this town, but the only hotel in town is completely full, so I did not get a shower, and here I am sitting in the city public library, smelling so bad I can hardly stand myself, and I can only wonder if the other patrons are wondering if I am off my meds. (if I play this right, NOBODY is going to ask me to get off the computer, as they want to use it.) Anyway, a few days ago, I passed a sign informing me that I had completed one fourth of the AT. This gave me a tremendous feeling of pride and accomplishment, that very quickly faded when I realized that I still have to hike THREE TIMES as far as I've come so far to complete the hike. YIKES! Is the glass one quarter full or is it (Heaven forbid) three quarters empty? That means I have to hike another 550 miles just to have the glass either half full, or half empty.","Helvey's Mill Shelter

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535584,"My supper always involves boiling water and cooking a Knorrs package of noodles or rice. When I first remove my cooked meal from my camp stove, I have to allow it to cool for at least 10 minutes before I can eat it. During this 10 minute interval, I usually do various camp chores. One night, I was too lethargic to do camp chores, and just sat next to my food, waiting for it to cool, which turned out to be a lucky accident for me. Dogs are allowed on the AT, and a golden retriever (his owners were 200 yards behind on the trail) came bounding into my camp. He smelled my food, gave me some dog eyes that could melt the coldest heart, wagged his tail vigorously to let me know that I was his closest friend on the entire planet, and made a beeline for my supper. I snatched my cooking pot out of his reach in just the nick of time. Dogs and humans suffer the same fate on the AT: near famine conditions. A dog travels the same distance as its owner, and a dog has to eat as well. Most dogs are fitted with 2 small saddlebags, one for each side of his rib cage. Each saddlebag is filled with dog food, but the owner must also carry a portion of the dog's food in his/her backpack. As hikers do not want to have heavy packs, the dog gets just enough food to get by. As hikers do not want to have heavy packs, the human gets just enough food to get by. Golden retrievers are my favorite breed of dog. Having said that, I had walked many miles of rocky mountainous trail with a heavy pack, and my reward was a 280 calorie meal, and I was damned if I was going to share that meal with a hungry dog. A few minutes later, the dog's owners (a couple) strolled into my camp, apologized profusely for the fact that their dog had acted like a dog, and informed me that the dog's name was Dexter. The hair on the back of my neck stood straight up. You see, my last name is Detzner, which means the dog and I are practically family. Hell, had I known the dog's name was Dexter, OF COURSE I would have shared my supper with him (nudge, nudge, wink, wink)","Stealth Camp, Mile 603

There is an infamous hikers shelter along the at trail in Virginia called the wapiti shelter.over thirty years ago, a madman shot and killed two female hikers in this shelter. He went to jail for many years. Unfortunately, when he was released from prison, he had not reformed. He returned to the same shelter and shot two men who were staying at the shelter. The two men were wounded. But not killed, and they escaped into the woods at night and hiked into a town and alerted the authorities who killed the madman. So when I hiked to this shelter, I of course thought it would be an interesting experience to stay at the shelter. There were fourteen of us staying at the shelter that night. Thirteen of us decided to hedge our bets and sleep in our tents, not the shelter. One brave soul not me spent the night in the shelter.

I was lucky enough to meet another hiker who was being picked up by his girlfriend to celebrate his 26th birthday. Since he was going through the town I was hitching to, he offered me a lift. As we had time to kill while we waited for his girlfriend we began to brag about what animals we had seen that day. He said that he had only seen a deer that day. When his girlfriend picked him up, he enthusiastically told his very attractive girlfriend that he had seen a rattlesnake that day, right on the hiking trail. As he did not want other hikers to be bitten by the snake, he very bravely used a stick to coax the rattlesnake off the trail. Bragging is a sport among guys. You want to be more impressive than any other guy there. So as I listened to his story I wondered why he had said norhing to me about this rattlesnake. I began to suspect that his story was bogus, and he was just trying to impress his girlfriend. I said nothing, and after I got my groceries and hitchhiked back to the trail, I began to muse on whether or not his story was true. I rounded a blind corner, and there, stretched across the trail, I was face to face with a three foot longi snake. I stared at the snake, it stared back at me. The snake seemed to think that since he was there first, he had the right of way. So I went through the underbrush to avoid the snake. The snake who was as wary of me as I was of him, watched me very carefully until he was satisfied that I meant him no harm. Then he slithered off. Don't worry. Mr. snake. Any animal that finds on mice and rats is a friend of mine. Those of you who know me best are probably suspicious about this story and wondering if I had no story for today, and thus made this entire story up.

You then tell the priest all the sins you have committed, and he then forgives you for your sins, provided you say the prayers he assigns you as your penance. Each shelter has a logbook and a pen and hikers are invited to write anything they want in the logbook. The log book in the Priest Shelter had a stern warning that it was to be used SOLELY as a confessional. Each person began his/her entry with the words ""Bless me father, for I have sinned."" They then confessed their crimes, each person trying to be more gruesome than the previous entrants in describing their murder, mayhem, and skullduggery.

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539062,"A few days ago, I hitchhiked into the town of Buena Vista, VA to buy food. By a lucky coincidence, I got there just in time for day one of an annual bluegrass festival, a type of music which I really enjoy. While my timing was perfect, I was also unfortunate in that a rain storm occurred that evening. I then had one of my many weird but pleasant experiences. I passed a very tiny band stand. It had a roof, but no walls. Inside, a bluegrass band was rehearsing for the next days competition. Ordinarily, people would have been sitting in the grass next to the bandstand and listening. However, due to the fact that it was raining very hard, there was not a single person sitting in the grass listening to them. I then noticed that there was a single unoccupied chair on the bandstand, so I got up on the stage and sat in the chair right next to the band and became an audience of one as the rain beat against the roof and the band produced some WONDERFUL music. After the band finished their set, I chatted with them and returned to my tent. Shortly after, the rain ended. I had been told that jam sessions went on well into the night, so I got up and wandered the grounds until I found a group of jamming musicians. (Guitar, fiddle bass, banjo and mandolin.) They jammed for quite a while, and I was in heaven. It amazes me that musicians can be that accomplished, and completely unknown. To them, music is a hobby. The joke is that it is very expensive to be a musician. It is not the cost of the musical instruments as much as it is the cost of the motor homes that every musician seemed to own. The other impressive event that occurred during my stay in Buena Vista was a long conversation I had with a retired army captain. He served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He has 100% lifetime disability due to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). He has hiked the entire Appalachian Trail (AT) twice. He now hikes just parts of the AT every year, because he says if he doesn't, he gets suicidal. There are many Iraq/Afghanistan vets who are spending several years hiking/loafing sections of the AT just to deal with their PTSD.","The Priest Shelter

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539063,"Today, as I rounded a bend high in the mountains on the AT, I saw an old man seated on a rock, enjoying a picnic lunch. (here's the scary part. I use the term ""old man"", and he was my age.) I noticed he was not wearing a shirt, which is not unusual on the AT. Then I noticed that he was not wearing pants or underwear either. He wore only socks and shoes. He also had a rucksack on his back. I was stunned. What do you say to a naked man? We chatted about the AT terrain for the next few minutes. I then excused myself and resumed my hike. (I later found out that the man's trail name is ""Naturist Dave,"" and he is a regular on certain parts of the AT) An hour later, I was eating my own lunch (fully clothed) by the side of the Blue Ridge Parkway, which is a very popular road with tourists. I assumed that Naturist Dave liked to hike to isolated and secluded parts of the AT, and remove his clothes, where their was very little chance of him being found by many people. However, Naturist Dave turned out to be ""a freer spirit"" than I gave him credit for. Dave sauntered across this major tourist highway, (BRP) naked as a jaybird, just as casually as if he were going to retrieve his Sunday paper from his lawn. As he passed me a second time, I couldn't resist asking if he didn't fear arrest for his ""hobby."" No, he said. He had never had a problem with the police. I have a feeling that one day, Naturist Dave may find himself in front of a judge. Based on what I saw, Dave will have valid grounds for asking that all charges against him be dropped ""due to insufficient evidence."" At about six PM that evening, I saw my first bear. It sauntered onto the AT 75 yards ahead of me. It was a full grown bear. He simply sat down on the AT and stared at me. AT wisdom says that there are 2 kinds of bears. One group of bears will see a person and run into the woods as fast as they can. The other group of bears are dangerous because they have lost their fear of humans and they will do ANYTHING to separate a hiker from his food. I had two conflicting emotions. One was a terrible fear, because I was all alone, and the bear clearly had no fear of me. The other emotion was DESPERATELY wanting to take pictures of the bear with my camera. I did not do this, because my camera was in my backpack, and I feared that if I removed my backpack to get my camera, the bear might charge me. At one point, the bear took a few steps in my direction, which made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, because if a bear walks toward you, you are in BIG trouble. The bear and I stared at each other for about five VERY long minutes, and eventually he shuffled off into the woods. I then took a few hurried pictures of the bear from a distance. That encounter gave me a tremendous adrenaline jolt, which carried my the rest of the way into my campsite.","Maupin Field Shelter

The day before, I climbed Three Ridges Mountain, a brutal 2000 foot climb in three miles in a scorching hot sun. That day was a picnic compared to the day that followed. Every hiker has certain types of terrain that they dread. Some hikers hate hot weather, or steep up hills, or steep down hills. My worst nightmare is miles and miles of uninterrupted boulder hopping. Two days ago, I had 10 miles of it in a scorching hot day with gnats dancing around my head all day long. By the end of the day, I was in such a bad mood that I would have sucker punched Santa Claus if I had the opportunity. This is not a good thing, because Pennsylvania has LONG stretches of boulder hopping that make Virginia seem like a Sunday school picnic. Nimble Will Nomad, a hiking guru has a famous quote: ""time, distance, terrain, the weather, and the trail itself cannot be changed. I must change."" Another hiking guru, Warren Doyle says to ""hike on the happy side of misery."" I an just going to have to get mentally tougher about boulder hopping and remember that everyone else is experiencing the same misery as I am (except for some of those damn young twenty somethings who seem to scamper effortlessly across boulders and sharp or unsteady boulders.).

When I attempt to post an entry from my android phone i experience huge problems. Sometimes it takes me hours to post a few entries. There is a Verizon store here in Waynesboro, so i am posting a day early and i am hoping the Verizon people will coach me to post from my phone quickly and easily. Now for the sad tale of my missing hiking poles. Fifty miles ago, I was staying at the free campground in the city of Glasgow VA. I needed to hitch hike several miles to get back to the AT. Suddenly a trail angel appeared at the campground. She would take me back to the AT but she was leaving immediately. I went to get my hiking poles. I always put them beside my tent. They were not beside my tent, so i assumed somebody had stolen them. I later remembered that i had moved my hiking poles to the bunk house when I charged my cell phone, but by that time, I was many miles away. I found two sticks in the woods that i have been using as hiking poles for the last fifty miles. A few nites ago, I lamented the loss of my hiking poles to a friend whose trail name is Freefall. Freefall informed me that my hiking poles had been rescued by a trail angel named Scratch, but Freefall did not know how I could get in touch with Scratch. I have another hiking friend named Kickit who is very well connected among the AT hiking community. Kickit gave me the cell phone number of the Michael Jordan of Trail angels, Miss Janet, and I bow my head in reverence when I say this name, because Miss Janet has been a trail angel for over thirty years. Will Miss Janet be able to rescue my hiking poles, or will I have to shell out big bucks for new hiking poles. Stay tuned for the answer to this question.z","Tree Streets Inn, Waynesboro

Since my last post, I have hiked a little over 100 miles, the length of Shenandoah Natl. Park, (SNP) and they have no wifi connections, even in the restaurant/resort areas of the park. Since I ""wasted"" my last posting at the Verizon store in Waynesboro, trying in vain to figure out how to get rid of the bugs in posting via my android phone, today I will list my hikes for two days. The first day (June 23) was 7.7 miles to Calf Mountain Shelter. On June 24, I hiked 13.0 miles to Blackrock Hut. ( A hut is exactly the same thing as a shelter. It is called a hut bercause it is inside Shenandoah Natl. Park (SNP). Once I leave SNP,the places where I camp will once again be referred to as shelters.) Well, a funny thing happened when I took my android phone to the tech gurus at Verizon in Waynesboro. Have you ever had an experience with your car where the repair light comes on on your dashboard, the car engine starts making ominous noises like it's about to explode, it drives erratically, so you take the car in to your mechanic. Just before you get to the shop, the car repair light on your dashboard shuts off, the engine begins to purr like a kitten, the car now drives smooth as silk, and the mechanic looks at you like you are a nut job when you try to explain your car problems to him. Well, after spending a few hours to get to the Verizon store which was a few miles outside of Waynesboro, I typed a post on this blog, and I could not for the life of me get my phone to screw up. Nope, everything went smoothly, with not a single glitch. The sweet young twentysomething that was my customer service person looked at me like I was a kook and very gently but sweetly informed me that she could not fix a problem I was not presently having. Maybe it was my imagination, but as the Verizon door closed behind me after this encounter,, I could swear my phone began to snicker. I am presently staying at the Super 8 motel in Front Royal, VA and using the computer in their lobby, so I have no idea what problems I will have the next time I post from my phone. My first day back on the Appalachian Trail (AT) after my rest day (and birthday) in Waynesboro was a very short day, just 7.7 miles. THAT WAS A GOOD THING, AS I HAD TO RUN ERRANDS THAT MORNING,PLUS THE MORNING WAS MISERABLE, WITH HEAVY RAINS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THE WEEATHER CHANNEL SAID I WOULD HAVE A 6 HOUR WINDOW OF NO RAIN BEGINNING LATE IN THE MORNING, JUST ENOUGH TIME FOR ME TO DO MY VERY SHORT HIKE AND SET UP MY TENT. THE SKY BEGAN TO GET PARTLY CLEAR, SO THE INNKEEPER AT THE B&B I WAS STAYING AT GAVE ME A RIDE BACK TO THE AT AND DROVE OFF. AS SOON AS HE LEFT, MOTHER NATURE SPRUNG HER TRAP. THE WEATHER WENT STRAIGHT TO HELL IN A BIG HURRY. TT GOT SCARY WINDY, (THE NEXT MORNING THERE WERE SEVERAL HUGE TREES BLOWN OVER). THE SKIES TURNED AN OMINOUS COLOR, THE RAIN CAME DOWN IN SHEETS, AND THERE WAS LOTS OF THUNDER. I WONDERED IF A TORNADO WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. FORTUNATELY, EVERYTHING TURNED OUT OK. MY WORST MOMENT CAME WHEN I was on a mountaintop with 6 electrical towers within half a mile. I tiptoed past them as quickly as I could, because I knew that if a lightening strike lit up those towers, I would be fried like a piece of bacon. The next day, I experienced the worst fog I have ever seen (this part of the Appalachians is famous for its intense fog.) SNP has a nickname among AT hikers. It is called ""The Riviera"" of the AT, because there are 3-4 restaurants along the way where hikers can buy hamburgers, french fries, hot dogs, milkshakes, etc. The fog was so intense that I could nmot see the restaurant (called a wayside) building until I was 5 feet away from it. Other hikers told me the blackberry milkshakes were NOT to be missed. I had two of them. The reason I had two was because I accidently spilled the first one.","Tree Streets Inn Waynesboro

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540277,"At the huts, there are 2 sleeping options. You can sleep in the mice/mosquito infested 3 walled huts (the huts/shelters are rectangular 3 sided buildings. One wall is missing and open to the great outdoors. The other option is to find a level spot and pitch a tent. I always sleep in my tent. A very large percentage of the hikers smoke a great deal of marijuana at the huts/shelters, and they make no effort to hide it. Rumer has it that there are undercover DEA agents with packpacks who hike the AT and secretly keep tabs on who is using/selling drugs of any sort. It was late in the evening. I had already retired to my tent, which was pitched in the woods, very close to the shelter. Two armed Natl. Park rangers strolled into the hut, which was very heavy with the smell of dope. It is mandatory for every person camping in Shenandoah Natl. Park (SNP) to fill out and carry with them at all times a permit, stating when they entered the park and where they plan to camp every nite. Lying in my tent, I could hear every word the rangers said. The rangers asked to see everyone's permit. One man had not filled out a free permit form, and was fined $80. The rangers then stated that the previous nite, someone staying at another shelter had complained to the rangers about a dope smoking young lady who was hiking with her dog (and the description of the dog matched the dope smoking young lady's dog perfectly.) The rangers told all the young people (ALL of who had been smoking pot, and ALL of whom had pot inside their backpacks) that they had a choice. They could either turn their dope over to the rangers and face a misdemeanor fine of $300, or they could have their packs searched, and any dope found would result in a felony charge. The young lady and one other fellow turned over their pot and got fines of $300 apiece. The other dopers decided to call the rangers' bluff and declared they had no pot. Their bluff worked, and their packs were not searched. I lay inside my tent, listening to all of this and cowering in fear. I had a permit, and I had no illegal substances of any sort, so in theory, I had nothing to worry about, However, a few years ago, I was a victim of a Natl. Park Ranger fine, and my fear was that the rangers would come to my tent, announce that I was illegally camped in a no camping zone (even though there was no sign of any sort stating that I was in a no camping zone) and levy a steep fine against me. I had this fear because a few years ago, I obtained a permit to camp right next to the ocean in Canaveral Natl. Seashores Park. When I arrived at the park headquarters, I asked a uniformed park ranger where I was allowed to camp. He replied that it would be very obvious where my camping area was. He said look for a sign that said ""camping area"" and camp there. I found the sign, and pitched my tent right under the sign. I knew I was in the right spot, because although the area was heavily vegitated, there was no vegetation where I pitched my tent, plus there was a very obvious path, indicating several other people had camped there in the past. I was fined $150 and screamed at for 20 minutes by a ranger, who told me I was camping in an off limits area. The fact that there was a sign right next to my tent saying ""camping area"" made no difference to the ranger. I appealed the fine to the director of Natl. Parks in Washington DC, who upheld the fine because ""I should have known I was in an ofgf-limits area."" In my letter appealing my fine, I asked that the sign saying ""camping area"" be removed to prevent further campers from using this area. This issue was not even addressed in the response I got. My guess is that the sign is still there, and park rangers are still collecting fines from people who ""should know better"" than to camp underneath a sign that says ""camping area."" By the time the rangers finished with the pot smokers, it was completely dark, and my tent was very tough to spot. I don't want to be cynical, but perhaps it was darkness that saved me from another fine from park rangers ""double secret rules"" that you are never told, but nevertheless expected to follow. As for the undetected pot smokers who did not have their pot confiscated, they learned their lesson and got rid of their pot the next morning. They got rid of their pot by smoking it as I ate breakfast with them the next morning.","Hightop Hut

The AT is marked by painting white rectangular ""blazes"" (markings) on rocks and trees.

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540336,"Today I saw a very large black bear. The two most common bears in the US are the grizzly bear and the black bear. Grizzly Bears are HUGE and very dangerous. Fortunately, there are no grizzly bears on the AT. Black bears are dangerous only if a person gets close to a mother bear with cubs, or a bear that has lost its fear of humans and senses that a person has food available. Bears have very poor vision and hearing. Their sense of smell is 6 times as powerful as a bllodhound's nose. At all campsites in Shenandoah Natl. Park (SNP) bear boxes and bear poles are provided to keep campers from being robbed of their food by hungry bears. Park rangers used to advise campers to keep all food in their cars. They are now telling visitors to the park to lock their car doors, as bears have learned to open unlocked car doors! If a park visitor uses this strategy, they will save their food, but the bear will rip the door handles off the car.(Far better to store food in either bear boxes or bear poles.) If a bear feels threatened by a person who has unexpectedly come very close to it, the bear will respond with a ""bluff charge."" This means the bear will charge toward the person, but stop and retreat if the person does not make the worst mistake of all when dealing with an angry bear, which is to run. If a person is confronted by a bear's bluff charge, the person must stand his/her ground, and scream and shout and wave your arms around and make yourself look as big as possible. If necessary, you throw rocks and sticks at the bear. In the extremely unlikely event that the bear attacks you, playing dead is the WORST thing you can do. If you play dead, you may soon actually BE dead. If attacked by a black bear (again, an extremely rare occurrence) you need to fight as if your life depends on it, because it does. There are 2 reasons why running away from a black bear is a bad idea. First,if you attempt to run away from a bear, its instinct kicks in and the bear looks at you as prey.Second, a bear can run at speeds of up to 39 miles per hour, far faster then the world's fastest human. After the bear has bluff charged, the correct strategy is to remain facing the bear while shouting, waving your arms, and acting like a fool while you slowly back away from the bear.Although the park ranger did not say this, the last step in this process would probably be to go change into a fresh, clean pair of underwear","Pass Mountain

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540340,"A few days ago, I had a funny experience. I was hiking the AT when I came across a single shower slipper lying on the trail. Many hikers carry their foot wear attached to the outside of their backpacks, and one or both shoes can fall off a backpack, without the hiker being aware that this has happened. So I stared at this shower slipper, wondering what I should do. One thought was that I should just leave it, just in case the hiker came back looking for it. The other thought was that since it was early morning, and most young hikers like to sleep in, and given the fact that there was a shelter less than two miles away, that I should take the shower slipper and see if it belonged to anyone staying at that shelter.I decided this was the best idea, so I grabbed the showeer slipper and began my quest to find its owner. When hiking the AT, a person has LOTS of very queit alone time for thinking, and soon fantasies about the owner of the shower slipper began dancing in my head. The owner would of course be a drop dead gorgeous twenty something. When hiking the AT, little things that would not normally upset a person can be devastating. So here (in my mind) there is an emotionally crushed gorgeous babe, who is totally bummed out because she lost one of her shower slippers, when who shows up but a kindly older gallent gentleman who saves her bacon by rescuing her slipper. Ah yes, fantasies. Then there is reality. I came to a stealth camp, with 3 guys in it. I asked if anyone was missing a shower slipper. A very big, burly man who hadn't shaved in several weeks and had an unlit cigarrette dangling from his lips (and used to be in the 82'nd army airborne division) stepped forward. ""It's mine.

I was under the impression that only a small handful of people were reading my blog. However, I heard from friends that there were nationwide fireworks and parties and celebrations just hours after I passed the one thousand mile mark. WOW. I had no idea that my hike had obtained that kind of a following. I am truly humbled, (and i have no idea why people accuse me of being a meglomaniac.) Im starting to feel like Forrest Gump. (Go Forrest, go) Heres the sad thing. Ive hiked a thousand miles and im not even half way done yet. Yikes. A very wise Chinese philosopher once said that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Hmmm... I wonder what his thoughts would be on a journey of more than twice that length.He might have added that the journey would end many, many many steps after completing that first rhousand miles.","Sam Moore Shelter

A thru hiker is out hiking for anywhere from four to eight months, however long it takes to complete the AT. The longer a person is on the AT, the more feral (wild/animl like)he/she/or it becomes. An example of this can be found in the way the three different hikers treat a piece of M&M candy found lying on the AT. A day hiker will either totally ignore that piece of candy, or step on it.

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541991,"Today was a rest day for me at a hiker hostel run by a church. I met three amazing people there. The first was a very quiet, humble, unassuming man who is a legend among long distance hikers. He is a 69 year old man. His trail name is Sunset. The three longest, toughest hikes in the US are the Appalachian Trail (AT), Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), and the Continental Divide Trail (CDT). A person who hikes all three of these trails is called a ""Triple Crowner."" There are not many Triple Crowners. Sunset has done all three of these hikes two times each. I am guessing that less than 5 people have done that. On Sunday evening, Sunset practicing Trail Magic, bought and cooked enough chicken, vegetables, and apple pie to feed everyone staying at the hostel. Sunset seems to also be a very religious man. The second amazing person I met was a man to whom I will asign the trail name of Gandolf. If you have read books by JRR Tolkien, you know that Gandolf was a very heroic figure. Gandolf, like many other people who are hiking the AT is hiking to regroup after suffering personal tragedy. He had a very athletic girlfriend that he loved a great deal. One day, she had an accident resulting in a large bruise on her leg. Neither Gandolf or his girlfriend thought this injury was very serious. A few days later, the girlfriend phoned Gandolf at work to say she was in great pain and going to the hospital. Gandolph asked the girlfriend if she wanted him to take time off from work to meet her at the hospital. The girlfriend, thinking she was fine, told him that it was not a serious medical problem, and told him not to take time off from work. Four hours later she was dead from a blood clot that traveled through her body. The girlfriends parents, in their grief at their daughters sudden death, were very angry that Gandolf had not gone to the hospital. Gandolph, practicing Trail Magic, bought food and prepared it to feed everyone in the hospital a breakfast of blueberry pancakes, sausage, and eggs. The third amazing person I met at the hostel is a man who is in the process of completing his fourth thru hike of the AT. His trail name is Trouble. When the man who ran the church hiker hostel was hospitalized for several days, Trouble, practicing Trail Magic, interrupted his hike to run the hostel for 10 days while the hostel owner recovered.

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541995,"Today was a very memorable day for me. Today I FINALLY crossed the half way point of the AT. I was warned by Fred D., a hiking buddy who has previously hiked the AT that there are actually TWO signs announcing the halfway point of the AT. The first sign was at mile marker 1094.55. I walked another four miles to find (to my horror) that even though I had walked an additional 4 miles, the second sign gave me credit for only 1090 miles. Holy Smokes, I thought. If there is a third half way sign, I might get credit for only 500 miles!!! I knew in an instant what was happening. I was being punished with bad karma for my foul deed of signing away the homes of four good friends to a religious commune. Given the fact that my dastardly deed has resulted in negative blowback affecting me personally, I am wracked with sorrow and remorse for the horrible thing I have done to my dear friends, and I want to offer my deepest apologies to them (If, on the other hand, this (decreasing mileage) is all just a coincidence, and my nasty misdeeds will NOT result in negative blowback to me, my four dear friends can all go to hell!) I don't know how a person can be more sincere and remorseful than that!

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542005,"I have been walking thru the woods for four months now. During that time, I have been lucky to have seen many very beautiful birds. I enjoy bird watching a great deal. Three birds stand out as the most impressive I have seen or heard during my hike. The first bird is the grouse. I have never actually seen a grouse during this hike, but I have frequently heard them in the forest. The grouse has a very unusual call that sounds like an engine starting up. The grouse is about the size of a chicken, and looks like a miniature turkey. The grouse is a very territorial bird, especially if you get too close to its hidden nest, and many an unsuspecting hiker who accidently strolled to close to as hidden grouse nest has been charged by a very irate and aggressive bird. My second favorite bird is the pileated woodpecker. There are many different kinds of woodpeckers. The pileated woodpecker is the largest woodpecker still in existence in the US. Some people see a pileated woodpecker and get all excited, because they mistake it for the probably extinct ivory billed woodpecker. A very large woodpecker has a very large bill, and when a pileated woodpecker drills its beak agaainst a tree trunk (looking for bugs to eat), it makes a very loud sound, like a jack hammer. You would think that a bird this large, making a sound that is very loud would be very easy to spot. The truth is that although I often hear the pileated woodpecker, I very seldom see one, no matter how carefully I search for it. My runaway favorite bird is the owl. Owls are nocturnal (night) birds, so I seldom see them.At night, as I lay in my tent, I often hear one or more owls. To me, there is something almost spiritual about the hauntingly beautiful call of the owl. Hearing an owl at night never fails to put me into a very good mood. On rare occasions, I get lucky, and I will hear two owls calling to each other at night near my campsite. One morning, at about 8:00 AM (long after an owl's bedtime,) as I first began to hike, I startled an owl in a tree right next to the AT. (I think it was a barred owl.) It flew away, and then I noticed that there was not one, but two owls flying thru the woods and staying very close to each other. They were calling to each other, but it was a bird call that was completely different from the call they use at night. I think I may have interrupted a courtship, and perhaps the call they were using between themselves was a ""honey, have I told you lately how attractive your feathers are"" call.","Toms Run Shelter

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542014,"Today, I walked part way thru the Cumberland Valley. On most of the AT, you do NOT have to camp at shelters, and are allowed to camp anywhere along the AT where you can find level ground. However, in the Cumberland Valley, where I presently am, you can camp ONLY in shelters. I would have had to walk 18 miles to get to a shelter today. I have had two back to back very tough hiking days, so I only hiked 12 miles today, and treated myself to a hotel tonite. (ah, what luxury Air conditioning in July, plus a shower, yeah, that's living the good life!!!) When a person travels in the wrong direction on the AT he/she gets teased about it, but the truth is that almost everyone gets turned around once or twice. It happened to me a few days ago. I was hiking in a driving rainstorm that took me to a mountaintop. The higher up in a mountain you are, the worse the weather is. So when I got to the mountaintop, the rain was coming down horizontally, and visibility was very poor. I mistakenly thought the trail turned to the right, but the path quickly ended. I turned around, and spotted the familiar white blazes (trail markings) on the trees and began to follow them. Then I came across a sign that I had just passed, and realized I was accidently backtracking. I began to feel a little worried, but then I saw a jogger jogging towards me in the driving rain. I thought I was a macho stud, because I was in the storm in just my t-shirt, but the jogger (who I will refer to as Tarzan) was young, very muscular, and bare chested. As he passed me, I shouted out ""I'm headed south (the wrong way for me) on the AT, aren't I?"" ""Yes,"" he shouted. ""What should I do when I get to the mountaintop?"" I asked. In a very patient voice, as if he were speaking to a not very bright small child, Tarzan shouted back, ""you should follow the trail markings."" I decided to try a different approach. ""When I get to the mountaintop, should I go left, or should I go right,?"" I asked. ""You should go left,"" he shouted back. He was correct. It felt very good to be going in the correct direction again. It also felt very good not to have been caught by my friends hiking in the wrong direction.During the spring, getting caught in a rainstorm meant I got very, very cold. However, now that it is summer, as long as I keep moving, it feels very comfortable to walk in the rain.","Alec Kennedy Shelter

The store challenges hikers to eat a half gallon of ice cream. There is no time limit on this chore. Those hikers who sucessfully complete this chore are awarded a wooden spoon. For weeks, I debated whether or not I would attempt this feat. The decision was pretty much made for me, as I arrived at the store early in the morning, in no mood to eat hald a gallon of ice cream. I puppied out with three scoops of bright purple ice cream that I was assured was raspberry. It was a wise decision, as my stomach growled for several hours afterwards. It is no small feat to eat a half gallon of ice cream in one setting, so one would naturaaly assume that the wooden spoon one is awarded for doing this would be fairly impressive, but that would not be a correct assumption. Readers, do you remember the tiny, flimsy wooden spoon you got when you bought a small cup of ice cream from the convenience store? Well, when a hiker, groaning in pain from pigging out on ice cream, waddles into the store to claim his/her prize, he gets that very cheap, unimpressive tiny wooden spoon. Eating half a gallon of ice cream in one sitting kind of reminds me of the situation where a boa constrictor swallows a very large animal all at once. That poor snake is not going to travel very far for a long time. One of my friends successfully absorbed a half gallon of ice cream. He did no more hiking for the remainder of the day. Of course, like with every other challenge, some people have a need to become the best of the best. In the store, they have a picture of a fellow who consumed an entire gallon of ice cream. You would think that only a very fat person could do this, but the person was a very skinny man.","Days Inn, Carlisle, PA

The AT goes thru Maryland for 44 miles. My fantasy was that the AT would cross a Maryland road, and I would meet up with my cycling buddies. Unfortunately, I left Maryland just before my cycling buddies arrived for the start of their bike tour. One morning, I had just crossed the Maryland/Pennsylvania border and the AT followed a paved road for a short distance. I heard voices in the distance, a ways down the road. When I looked, I saw a group of 8 middle aged cyclists approaching me. As I was close to the Maryland border, I hoped it was my friend (Mary Beth,) her husband Jerry, and friends from my bike club. Alas, that was not the case. They called out greetings as they passed, and I really missed both my cycling friends, and cycling in general. (Cycling is MUCH less strenuous than backpacking.) Well, hot weather, incredible humidity, rocks and bugs have descended upon Pennsylvania. Locals say humidity is much higher than usual. That, combined with very hot weather, is making hiking very tough. I start hiking as early as possible, but by 8:00 AM, I feel like I'm in a sauna. I drink a gallon of water a day. I sweat so profusely that my shirt, my long pants (to protect me from ticks) and my underwear are so wet that I might as well have jumped into a lake. My underwear, soaked with sweat all day long, causes a skin inflamation on my buttocks that hikers call ""monkey butt."" The gnats and deer flys buzz by my head all day long. Gnats fly very close to my eyes and whine in my ears and are annoying. Deer flys have a painful bite. I was warned that at some point my hike would change from an adventure to an ordeal, and that time has come. A working person gets up every morning and goes to work. I get up every morning and churn out some miles. I am still having some fun and meeting interesting people. Pennsylvania is infamous for its rocks on the AT.

It would not be the first time my mail has been accidently lost. (sigh) I have been hiking the last two days with two middle aged women. On the first night, their tent was pitched close to my tent. The next morning, my throat was slightly sore, an indication that I had probably snored heavily the night before. One of the two ladies indicated that this was indeed the case, and that my snoring had interfered with her slumber. She was very polite when she said this. She also gently pointed out to me that there was a camping spot only a tenth of a mile away from the shelter where both the two women and I planned to spend the next night, and she said that might be a good place for me to pitch my tent. Well, I don't like it when people's snoring keeps me awake, and I am happy to oblige if there is a way for me to avoid keeping others from a good night's sleep as a result of my snoring. I was not at all offended, and I agreed to sleep at the non-shelter campsite. I arrived there shortly before 7:00 PM, and pitched my tent. I was the only one at the campsite. A few minutes later, the two prevoiusly mentioned women arrived and began setting up their tent. I mentioned that the shelter was only a tenth of a mile further along the AT, and that my snoring would probably again be a problem, but they insisted they were fine with spending the night at my campsite. A few minutes later, a party of three men and the young son of one of the men arrvied, also to spend the night.

When I said there was a road 6.1 miles away, he groaned, ""I'll never make it."" (Fortunately, there was a road 2.1 miles away that hopefully, he was able to totter to.) ""My gosh, it's Katz,"" I thought to myself. It was uncanny how much this guy matched the character played by Nick Nolte in the movie. Nick Nolte and this portly biker might be two different bodies, but they have the same mind. The next morning, at 6;00 AM, when Katz awoke, he decided that since HE was awake, everyone else needed to be awake. Most hikers speak in very quiet voices early in the morning because some hikers (especially twentysomething hikers) like to sleep in, but Katz was bellowing to his buddies. I honestly don't think it occurred to him that other people might want to get a little more sleep. Well, it turns out that a rattlesnake had also spooked these three men and the young kid on the preceding day. Almost nobody on the AT brings a gun with them, but the father of the young boy had brought his gun with him (he put it into my hand. It was very heavy.) He said he brought the gun to protect his son, and he came very close to blasting the rattlesnake. While I have no problem with a person killing ANY animal that is endangering one or more lives, the rattlesnake did not pose a threat to anyone. It's kind of a moot point, because the man (thankfully) did NOT shoot the snake, but my point is that very few people bring a gun (pistol) on the AT because it is not needed, and it makes no sense to carry something that you do not need and will not use on a hike.","Days Inn, Lebanon, PA

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543388,"I have a hiking friend named Bluegrass.He is a very strong and fast hiker. I have camped at several shelters with Bluegrass and spent some time chatting with him. In Virginia, Bluegrass had an unpleasant experience that caused him to consider quitting his AT hike. Fortunately, myself and some other people were able to provide some support, and Bluegrass is continuing his hike. I knew how Bluegrass felt, because a few weeks ago, I had also reached an emotional low point, and friends were able to provide some moral support for me. A few days ago, while hiking the AT, I reached a paved road crossing that also had a parking lot. There was a woman in the parking lot who asked me if I would like a cold soda. That sounded like a WONDERFUL idea to me, so i accepted her offer and we began to chat. She asked me if I knew a hiker named Bluegrass. I said he is a friend of mine and she said she was Bluegrass mother. This wonderful trail angel had spent her own money to buy cold drinks for dirty, smelly hikers she didn't even know, while sitting in a hot God forsaken parking lot all day long. I should have been filled with gratitude for this fine woman's sacrifice, thanked her profusely, and been on my way. Instead, my foul mind formulated an evil plot. I asked the woman if she would be interested in helping me to play a practical joke on her son. She said that would depend what the joke was about. After first assuring her that her son had not borrowed any money from me, I said that when her son got to get car,about an hour after I was there, she should mention my visit, and then tell Bluegrass that she had repaid the $200 that Bluegrass had borrowed from me, just to see what his reaction would be. The lady chuckled and said. her son would enjoy that joke, and agreed to reay my message to Bluegrass. The nextday, I was sitting on a log, eating a snack when Bluegrass walked past me. Bluegrass, as I suspected he would, had some things to say about my prank. He enjoyed it, but for a few seconds when he thought I had swindled his mother, I was not his favorite person. On the AT, boredom has become a problem, and playing practical jokes on each other is one way we fightboredom. If during the next several days, I find that one or more heavy rocks have been snuck inside my backpack when I wasn't looking, I will be deserving of this prank. However, determining who the culprit is may not be easy to establish, as Bluegrass is not the only victim of one of my practicaljokes.","Stealth Camping, Mile1196.2

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543660,"Yesterday, I hiked 12 miles to Eagles Nest Shelter. Yogi is an AT hiker slang word that means to beg. Last winter, I attended a workshop for future AT hikers. One of the high priests of AT hiking, Baltimore Jack (BJ) solemnly declared that no matter who we were in our pre-AT lives, we would eventually find ourselves yogiing, either for goods or services, no exceptions to the rule. I silently vowed that I would be the exception to the rule. Then reality happened. There are two kinds of yogiing. The first kind is blunt, demandingyogiing. This method rarely works. Then there is subtle yogiing. A yogi master can so subtly and skillfully beg for the goods or services he/she needs that the victim will swear that the idea of doing this good deed was all the victims idea. A few summers ago, while vacationing in New Hampshire, my wife and I experienced some blunt, unsubtle yogiing. We were in a campground and we were approached by 4 hikers. They made a good start by informing us that they had hiked over 2000 miles of the AT. Had they followed that up with a polite request for us to give them a ride into town to buy groceries, we would have gladly done so and refused any offers of payment. However, they strongly insinuated that since they had done this astonishing hike, that we pretty much owed them a ride into town. I do not respond well to others perceived entitlements. Myself and a new friend that I had just met were lounging in our campsite for the evening when two young men, dressed in fancy dress clothes and fancy shoes strolled into our campsite, with huge smiles. They said they were brothers, and asked if myself and my new friend were also brothers. This question surprised me, because (thankfully) I do not look anything like my new friend. I said that no, we were not brothers. Later, we would discover that this was an important question to the two brothers. The two brothers had parked their car in a parking lot very close to the AT. They said that their two sisters from Maine were visiting, and the four of them had just finished eating a picnic. I saw a prime opportunity to do some subtle yogiing. I casually mentioned that while I though Pennsylvania was a very beautiful state, my one problem was that most of the streams I depended upon for drinking water were dry, leaving me constantly short of water. The brothers said they had plenty of water left over from their picnic, and asked if I wanted any. I shrugged my shoulders and said yes, provided that would not be an inconvenience to them. When they returned, they not only had plenty of water, but many snacks, and a huge bowl of grapes. The two brothers and their two sisters insisted that me and my new friend consume everything they had brought. I felt like a yogi master. What I did not realize was that the hunter (me) was also the hunted, and that by accepting their very generous food/water offer, I had stepped right into their trap. You see, I was not the only one yogiing. They were yogiing too, and by accepting their generosity, I had left myself open to their yogiing, which consisted of preaching to me and my new friend. They were Mennonites, and they reached into their pockets and pulled out some religious tracts. I listened to them with genuine respect, because no one appreciates a yogi more than another yogi. As they were leaving our campsite, one of the brothers made a remark that initially puzzled both me and my new friend. The Mennonite man cautioned us to remember that God had ordained that marriage be restricted only to one man and one woman. Clearly, he thought my new friend and I were a gay couple, and we could not figure out how he came to this conclusion. Then we remembered the question about whether we were brothers, and my friend had not yet pitched his tent. They saw only one tent and assumed we were sharing a tent (which would not necessarily make us gay.) Well, hey, why not? During the course of my hike, I have been mistaken for a completely worthless bum, a homeless man, and now half of a gay couple. All right, all right. I am willing to concede that there may be more than a grain of truth to the completely worthless bum charge, but HOMELESS??? NEVER!!! And my wife will back me up on this one. Isn't that right, Ginny? Um, Ginny is there any reason why you changed the locks on the door, and my personal belongings are stacked up outside that locked door? Hmmm. A sage once said, ""Judge not, and ye shall not be judged."" I think that is a very wise thought. To that I would like to add something that I am going to call Marshmellow's Maxim: ""Yogi not, and ye shall not be yogied.""","Eagles Nest Shelter

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543950,"I took a week off from hiking the AT (July20-27) to attend the wedding of my niece (Missy) to her boyfriend Mike. I have been looking forward to this event for several months. For some events, the anticipation is greater than the actual event merits. That was NOT the case with Missy's wedding. That event met and even surpassed my expectations. Both Missy and her Dad (My brother Tom) expressed surprise that I would interrupt my hike for this event. The truth is that I wouldn't have missed this event for anything. Missy is very athletic. She had a problem in that one of her favorite 5km (3.1 miles) footraces was on the same day as her wedding. Fortunately for Missy, the race was in the morning, and her wedding wasn't until 2:30 in the afternoon, so she attended both events, although she dressed considerably more casually for the morning event. (A wedding gown is pretty tough to wear in a footrace.) I think my brother also ran in this event. The wedding was held outdoors in Steamboat Springs Botanic Garden. They say that at least one thing goes wrong in every wedding. In this wedding, the thing that went wrong was that my brother Tom seemed to be suffering from some kind of lip irritation. I say this because he kept biting his lip as he escorted Missy to be married to her boyfriend Mike. (wink, wink) Missy likes to involve everyone in her fun, and she could see no reason to exclude her dog (Zeplin) from the activities. Zeplin looked radiant in his/her floral dog collar, and was a very dignified ""dog-of-honor."" Unfortunately, it was a hot day, and Zeplin looked at the pond right next to where the wedding took place, and just knew it was the perfect time for a swim. Zeplin was held in check by two very small but determined flower girls who almost got pulled into the pond trying to restrain Zeplin. At the conclusion of the ceremony, the bride and groom rode to the reception in a pedicab, followed by a procession of friends on bikes. The groom (Mike) made a terrible mistake in that he made both of his brothers his best man. The first brother rose to (allegedly) propose a toast. However, this devious man had other ideas. He first said that he would probably be much briefer than the long winded brother who would follow him. He then launched in to a lengthy but VERY humorous accounting of every prank and misdeed the groom had been a victim of growing up as the youngest of three brothers. To be honest, it sounded like a roast. I glanced over at the groom, who had a smile on his face that seemed to say, ""this is probably going to be a LONG evening for me."" When the first older brother finished, his other brother took center stage. After first chastising his co-best man for accusing him of being long winded, when the first brother's speech had been everything except brief, the other brother then launched into an even longer but hilarious recounting of yet more of poor little brother's misdeed throughout his life. The groom's father then rose and announced that he wished he had one more son to marry off so he could find out what other terrible misdeeds were done by his kids when he wasn't home. I would have thought that my brother, being the bride's father would have immunity against the barbs of his son-in-laws family, but I was wrong. At one point, a sly remark was made that the color purple was chosen for one of the wedding colors because it was one color that my brother would never wear on his ski racing bib. I think that purple is the color that the very elite skiers wear on my brother's favorite yearly ski race (that he has participated in for 25 years) the Birkebiner. My brother then rose for his speech and announced that he was NOT going to embarrass his daughter at her wedding. He then added that he would wait until the last week in February to do that. This was his threat that his daughter had better watch out, or dear old Dad might beat her in the next Birkebiner. Missy did not seem too worried that this might happen. I wish I could report that the newlywed couple got off to a good start as good, decent, law abiding citizens, but alas, this would NOT be the case. They had been married only a few hours when they were stopped by the police. They were walking home from their wedding reception (not entirely sober) when the police stopped them to caution them that a crime had recently been committed in the area they were walking."," Port Clinton

There was a hiker right behind me and he told me I must have nerves of steel. Why do you say that, I asked. He told me the animal scurrying away from me had been a three foot long timber rattlesnake. That set me to thinking. I wondered how many other times a scurrying animal in the underbrush had been Ralph the rattler, or Colin thecopperhead. Next I saw two young fawns that still had white spots on their fur. Rain also brings out frogs, toads, and newts. The frogs and roads are perfectly camoflaged, but they hop away when I walk past.

When i was in my 20's, I was always polite to people of that ancient age, but I regarded them as being so different from me that they (the old folks) were practically from a different planet. I imagine that this is how the young people of the AT view me.They are always polite, but the conversations they have with me are different than the conversations they have among themselves. Last nite at the hiker hostel, many young people plus myself were sitting on the couches in the common room. I was on my cell phone, posting entries to this blog, so i became invisible to the young people and they began to chat among themselves. One young man said he had been tripping (taking drugs) for three of the last five days, and he figured that maybe he ought to stop for a while. Another guy said a dose of acid (LSD)costs $10.I piped up and said that I have always been amazed that young people have the stamina to hike all nite long. I asked him how they (young people) do this. He said that it is easy if you take a hit (dose) of acid (LSD). I thought he was joking so i said no, I'm being seroius. He replied so am i. He then said that he had hiked all but 20 of the 230 miles of the AT that is in Pennsylvania at nite. I could hardly believe what I was hearing. The rocks of N Pennsylvania were so treacherous that i was barely able to navigate them in broad daylight, and I was talking to a guy who had done it at nite, while high on LSD. He said he drops a hit, puts on his ear buds, listens to ambient music, and gets into a different state of mind and just does it.

Many of the hikers hike thru very rugged terrain at speeds I am unable to do even on a sidewalk. I have always wondered how they avoided getting a sprained ankle, because very few of them wear hiking boots. It is whispered that some hikers take amphetamines (speed) to give them more energy.

This means they take a shuttle to jump ahead to these states and hike them while the weather is still decent, and then continue to hike south until they reach the point where they caught the shuttle. The White Mountains of New Hampshire and Maine are by FAR the toughest part of the AT.Some hikers, who by that time have hiked nearly 2000 miles find this part of the hike so tough that they quit at this point. For this reason, i am going to do something called slackpacking from the White Mountains all the way to the end of the AT hike at Katadhin Mountain in Maine.

Slackpacking means you hike carrying only a day pack containing your lunch and some water. A car carries your other gear to your campsite at the end of the day.

The weather was perfect, with not a cloud in the sky. The views from on top of the mountain were superb, but it was very windy and chilly on the mountain top.","Glencliff N H

Last night the 15 of us were stealth camping at a trailhead when we were paid a viit by the Lincoln police dept. who told us we were illegally camped. By moving out tents just a few hundred feet, we became legal. We had to get up at three AM the next morning to begin our hike, so taking down our tents at eight PM, and setting them up again was disheartening. We had a 16.3 mile hike, and we began hiking at four thirty AM by the light of our headlamps. Today's highlight was a grueling ascent of South Kinsman MT, a 2000 foot climb, followed immediately by a very steep descent of 2000 feet. Again today the weather was perfect and the views spectacular. I had an unfortunate incident at the end of my hike today. I was walking down what I thought was US 3, to get back to the trail head where the today's hike ended. Unfortunately, I was walking along Interstate 93. A NH State trooper stopped me. He first frisked me for weapons, then called in a checkup on me based on my drivers license. He then very politely told me to get in the back of the car, and he gave me a ride to the trailhead. You should have seen the look on Warren Doyle's face when I pulled up in the back of a state police vehicle. It was my first and hopefully last ride in the back of a police car.","Kinsman Notch

Rising to the occasion (pun intended) I quipped that perhaps Warren was trying to show us that he is a real man. Warren seemed unimpressed by my response, but it was the best I could do on such short notice ( pun intended.) We began hiking at 5:00 AM. I finished hiking at 6:00 PM, and I was one of the first finishers. The last group finished at 2:00 AM the next morning. The next morning eight of the fourteen people who signed up to do this eight day trip dropped out. Weather wise, it was a very pleasant day. The daily schedule reminds me of my army boot camp days.My alarm clock goes off between three and four AM. I take down my wet tent, quickly gulp down a breakfast of a few granola or cliff bars, and begin hiking by the light of my headlamp by five AM. This happens because we literally need every moment of daylight to hike because the terrain involvesjungle ing and descending between three and five thousand feet of VERY steep terrain over a so called hiking trail that is nothing more than a tangled jumble of boulders that we slowly, carefully boulder hop across.","Franconia Notch

Today, we hiked over Franconia Ridge, above tree line, with some of the most scenic views in all of New England. Unfortunately, we had pea soup fog all day long, and we missed those beautiful views. Above tree line, the terrain is like being on the surface of the moon, and the only way you know you are still on the trail is because every so often, the trail maintenance people have stacked rocks on top of each other to form a rock tower (this is known as a cairn ).In the pea soup fog, it sometimes was hard to spot the next cairn. I was happy to descend to below the tree line, and better visibility, but when I got there, another unpleasant surprise awaited me.There is a desent of several hundred feet called "" The Abyss."" All descents in New Hampshire are incredibly steep, so for a descent to be called The Abyss, it was steep beyond belief. When I first saw it, I thought it would be impossible to safely descend. To sweeten the treat, there is a stream of water running through the Abyss descent. I decided to crab walk, using both my hands and feet on the ground. This gave me a very low center of gravity. The rocks of the Abyss were so tightly jammed together that there were no loose rocks. With my body only inches above the rocks, if I fell, I would fall only a few inches.The irony was that by crab walking down The Abyss, I was able to turn a dangerous descent into one of the places where I have felt the safest on the New Hampshire AT. To give you an idea of how steep the terrain here is, I climbed 1200 feet in eight tenths of a mile.(and there is no actual trail in New Hampshire. You simply boulder hop over a jumble of boulders. There is an organization called The Appilachian Mountain Club (AMC). They operate a series of buildings in the White Mountains called huts. For the princely fee of $125 a nite, you can sleep in a bunk in a room with 14 other people and get a delicious dinner and breakfast. These huts are high in the mountains. There are no roads leading to them. All supplies (food etc.) must be carried up steep mountain trails. One of the cooks at the hut said that on his last twice a week trip, he hauled over 100 pounds of food in his backpack.The people who work in these huts are called ""The Kroo."" They are often Ivy League college students. When they serve food to guests, they dress in costumes, sing songs, and do funny skits. Each hut has a powerful telescope. We were lucky because there was a guest astronomer at the hut and we got to see a few planets and the moon through the telescope, plus he gave an interesting talk.","Kinsman Notch

Today, at Galehead Hut, I was awakened at six thirty AM by a Kroo member playing live music on her fiddle. Usually, I hurriedly gobble down only a few cliff or granola bars for breakfast. Today I leisurely dined on oatmeal, bacon and eggs for breakfast. Usually I start hiking at five AM by the light of my headlamp. Today I began hiking at eight AM, in broad daylight. This happened on a day when I had 14.7 miles to walk. In spite of this I finished at six PM. How is this possible, you ask? Well, I got a gift today. I hiked over seven miles of the easiest terrain in New Hampshire. There was an actual path that was fairly level and rock free (I still ascended/ descended a few thousand feet today, because the other seven miles were horrible.) I got another gift today. For months I have heard but not seen a bird called the grouse. Today I rounded a bend and there were three of them, taking a dust bath. They were not at all upset by my being close to them, and I got some pictures of them. Today, we met a woman who had just finished climbing the last four thousand foot peak in New Hampshire that she had not yet climbed. There are 48 such peaks in NH. People who live in Colorado summit 14000 foot mountains. They might think that climbing a four thousand foot mountain is easy. It is not. Considering the steepness of N H peaks, and considering that there is no trail or foot path to the top, just a pile of boulders that you boulder hop across, these are some very tough mountains. It would be interesting to hear the perspective of someone who has climbed both 14000 foot mountains in Colorado and 4000 foot mountains in New England. We congratulated the woman for her accomplishment. She said her next goal is to climb every 4000 foot mountain in New England, which will give her a total of 46 mountains.","Galehead Hut

Washington will be one of the most grueling days of their entire AT hike. Mt. Washington boasts that it has the worst weather in the world. Once, they recorded winds of 238 miles per hour at the summit. Snow is possible 365 days a year. The terrain is a very steep 12.2 boulder hop to the top.

We were stealth camping in the woods. At 4:45 AM, when i had finished taking down my tent and packing my gear, in the pitch darkness, i was unable to find the path that led to the trailhead where I was to have my morning briefing. Fortunately, i located Ron, the strongest hiker in our group, and he knew where the path was. Our hike went well until we were half way up the mountain. Then the weather deteroirated to rain. We then hit a 20 minute storm. The sustained winds were 39 MPH, and the rain was hitting our faces horizontally, and at 39 MPH, the rain really hurt. We ascended the rest of the way in a pea soup fog, but were able to use the stone cairns to make it to the top. To make matters worse, one of our hikers had eaten too much ice cream the night before and had a bad stomach. I know how she felt, because a few days earlier i had eaten two peaches that tasted great, but caused me to very hurriedly use the woods bathroom four times in the morning.This may sound like a very tough day, but compared to other hikers, we got off very easy.

",Mount Washington ,"Aug 13, Sat",12.20
marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545701,"I will begin this entry with a riddle: I walked to the top of Mt. Washington twice, but I never walked down. How is this possible? The answer is that there is a private road (It costs $29 to drive a car to the top of Mt. Washington). When we got to the top of Mt. Washington the first time, Warren was waiting for us in his van, and he drove us down the mountain. The next morning, we started at the bottom of the mountain on the opposite side and hiked to the top of the mountain again. We did NOT walk the same route up the mountain twice. We first walked up one side of the mountain, then the next day we started at the opposite side of the mountain and walked back to the top again. We did this because the mountain is so steep that it is both easier and safer to walk up it twice.Some people say that the hike we did yesterday was the toughest one day hike on the AT. It took us seven hours to walk the seven miles from the mountain base to Madison Hut. We had to ascend Mt. Madison to do so, a route that is treacherous even by NH standards, and they have no mountain trail standards whatsoever. At the Mt. Madison Hut, we spent 15 minutes gobbling down their free cold, leftover eggs with cheese from breakfast and continued on our way. Given the fact that we were averaging one mile per hour, and given the fact that we left the hut at noon, we guessed we would reach Mt. Washington at 6:00 PM. This private road closes at 6:45 PM, so we were under time pressure. The AT on the way to the top of Mt. Washington is one of the WORST places to try and hurry, but due to our road closure deadline, that's what we did, with the predictable disasterous results. What they (AT) are calling a trail is a boulder field that stretches for ten miles. The boulders are of every size and shape imaginable, The sizes range from a football to half the size of a person. The boulders are wet from the constant rain and mist on the mountain. They are also covered with both moss and lichens, and thus are slippery. Some of the boulders are also loose and unstable and there is no way to tell in advance which boulders are unstable. Then there is the wind factor. We were lucky in that we had two consecutive days of weather that is gentle for Mt. Washington. The first day we had sustained winds of 39 MPH, The second day the winds were even less. However, it is common to have some gusts of 60 MPH or higher. I call it "" Rock Roulette."" Every step you take could result in a broken leg, ankle, arm, wrist, etc. It is not a question of if you are going to fall. We all fell several times. The question is are you going to be seriously injured when you fall. Also, we were carrying day packs with only lunch, water and a warm coat. Can you imagine what the boulder field must be like for people with full back packs? Do you know how much stress that puts on you when you are walking in such conditions all day long for several consecutive days? The most revered person in the history of the AT is the late Earl Shaeffer. (ES) ES was the first person to walk the entire AT in 1948. He did it again in the 1960's, and a third time in 1998. ES spent his life working on AT trail maintenance. After ES completed his third AT hike, he gave a speech where he BLASTED the AT trail routers for the way they had changed the routing of the AT over the decades. ES said that as far as he could see, the sole motivation for the routing changes of the AT over the decades had been to make the trail as difficult and as dangerous as possible. The AT has a failure rate of over 70 per cent. That is not a statistic to be proud of. There are many people who hike 1700 miles, and then quit when they get to the White Mountains of NH. Clearly, these are not weak willed or physically unfit hikers. The leadership of the AT blew ES off for his critical speech, saying he was entitled to his opinion. If you go to the AT website, they will have a noble praiseworthy mission statement. I am willing to bet that the unofficial mission statement of the route planners of the AT is to make the trail as difficult and dangerous as possible, because to them, a success rate of 25 per cent is disgracefully high. I still hold those people who work tirelessly and without pay to do trail maintenance on the AT in the highest regard, as I do for all the Trail Angels. Ok, I'm off my soapbox. . Now back to my demise.Shortly after leaving Madison Hut, while attempting to hurry to catch a ride before the $29 toll road closed for the night, I felt a sharp pain in my right knee. I got really scared, because I felt that if I further injured that knee playing Rock Roulette, I would be unable to walk out of that cold,foggy, rocky moonscape. Warren had insisted that the three people who were hiking that day stick together, and my two hiking companions, Jeff and Gene could not have been kinder and more helpful to me, and I am very grateful for their help. My spirits crashed to zero. I decided that when I got back to the car I would quit the hike and go home.

Today is August 14. According to my journal, I am already on August 15. I don't know how that happened. I had an interesting story from a few weeks ago. I was hiking when I heard an explosion of sound coming from a cluster of blueberry bushes. I had scared up a female turkey, and she was acting very strangely. She did not fly away.but she was squaking angrily at me. Just as I surmised that she must have a nest nearby, there was a mini explosion of sound as a turkey chick panicked and ran in front of me. At that point, mama turkey went ballistic. She fluffed herself up as big as she could, squaked even louder, and charged me. The whole thing was a diversionary tactic to give her chick time to get away. I had to admire mama turkeys courage, as I am much larger than she is. Mama turkey then pretended she had a broken wing and began sqauaking pitifully and running away from her nest, looking back frequently to make sure I was following her. I repeatedly assured mama turkey that i was not an employee of either the Tyson or Perdue poultry companies, but she did not seem to believe me. After she had lured me a safe distance away from the nest, mama turkeys broken wing miraculously healed and she flew back to her nest.","Mount Washington

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546197,"It took me 14 hours to hike 17 miles. This is because the terrain of NH and Maine is incredibly steep and rocky, with a great deal of boulder hopping involved. The ascents and descents often involve a gain or loss of elevation of over a thousand feet in less than a mile. This involves either a hand over hand climbing ascent, or a knee destroying descent. It is said that although NH and Maine are only 20% of the AT, it takes 50% of the total effort spent hiking the AT. Some people hike over 1700 miles and then quit the AT. They quit for two reasons. Some people quit because the terrain is so tough. Other people quit because they feel the terrain is unsafe and needlessly dangerous. I have felt unsafe several times while hiking thru NH and Maine. Anyway, on to the story if my unpleasant surprise. As a special treat, I bought myself a quart of pure mango juice for breakfast. I drank the whole thing all at once. It tasted SO good. So there I was, at the trailhead at 5:00AM, with my headlamp on in the darkness listening to Warren give his daily briefing when I got a sudden, OVERWHELMING urge to use the woods bathroom IMMEDIATELY. As soon as Warren left, I ran into the woods, dug a hole, and got some DESPERATELY needed relief. I repeated the process one more time that morning and made a mental note to never again drink a quart of pure mango juice for breakfast. Maine and NH have two big advantages over the other AT states. The first advantage is that the scenery here is some of the most spectacular of the entire AT. The second advantage is something that the AT guidebooks are too polite and tactful to mention. I, having no tact or class, am going to let you in on a little secret. In most AT states, the soil is so rocky and full of roots that you almost need a stick of dynamite to dig a hole for bathroom needs. This can be a problem if the need is urgent. However, here in NH and Maine, the soil is very peaty, so bathroom needs holes are much easier to dig. Here's one more fun fact before I sign off. The extremely steep descents often involve very smooth,very slippery rocks ( called smooth rocks) that may cause you to slip and fall if you attempt to walk down them. To avoid falling on these slippery smooth rocks, many people often slide down them on their behinds, causing an interesting discoloration of the back of their pants. So if you encounter an AT hiker with a discolored backside of his/her pants, it is probably NOT from drinking too much pure mango juice! I know, I know:TMI.","Gorham Motor Inn, Gorhsm, NH

I spent many days and many miles and many stories hiking with Marmalade. When Marmalade reached Harper's Ferry, he made the decision to do a ""flip flip"" and go to Mt.

Well, today I crossed into Maine, and to celebrate the occasion, it poured rain all nite long. It took me 11 hours to hike 10.3 miles. The rain turned the AT into a river of running water when the trail went downhill. The AT in southern Maine is very tough in the best of times. The rain made things much worse.It was a very scary day for me. The forest is very wet year round, and as a result there are mushrooms and toad stools of every size and color imaginable. I have two interesting stories. Some people bring their dogs with them on the AT. Today, I saw a man with a basset hound. (bh) A bh has very short legs, so it is impossible for the dog to leap to the top of the many high boulders. The owner solved this problem by attaching a girdle around the dogs midsectuon. At the top of the girdle, in the middle of the dogs back, was a handle like on a suitcase. So whenever the dog reached a rock it couldn't jump to the top of, the dog would give its owner a plainitive look, and the man would grab the handle and hoist the dog to the top of the rock. The other funny story was that I startled a chipmunk on the AT who immediately scooted into a nearby burrow (ie a hole in the ground) Immediately afterwards, it poked its head out of the burrow with a panicked look on its face. This puzzled me, but then I surmised that the burrow did not belong to the chipmunk, and when an animal ducks into another animals burrow, it risks becoming dinner for the animal that owns the burrow. If that was the case, that poor chipmunk was indeed caught between a rock and a hard place.","Success Mountain

I started by hiking Mahoosuc Notch, a one mile stretch of the AT that the guidebook describes as either the toughest or the most fun mile of the AT.The reason for this is because there is no actual trail through here. It is an area of HUGE boulders, some the size of houses that took us three hours to navigate thru. At times we had to take our packs off and crawl underneath boulders or over the top of boulders. I was the only person in our group who fell going thru this obstacle course. I got a minor scrape on my wrist and I cut up three of my fingertips. The next part of the hike we had to do is called Mahoosuc Arm. It is a very long, very steep climb.

It felt like I had eaten a brick. All day long I. felt like I was going to vommit, and I was panting very heavily all day, not as a result of exertion, but because I was ill. At one point, someone gave me some electrolites, and for a while my panting stopped and I felt better, but then the sickness and panting returned. I then had to climb a very tough and scary mountain called Old Speck. It was scary because near the top it got very steep, and there were no ladders, metal bars or wooden blocks to serve as hand or foot holds. I ended my day with a very steep 2500 foot descent.

(On two occasions in the past, a tree came crashing down close enough to me that I could hear the thunderous roar it made as it came crashing down.) Fortunately, no tree came crashing down on my tent that nite.There were two advantages to that very windy nite. The first advantage was that by morning my sopping wet tent was almost completely dry. The other advantage was that the wind blew away all of the clouds, ushering in a day of perfect visibility for one of the most scenic parts of the entire AT. The visibility was so good that there were NO clouds at all on Mt. Washington, and that almost never happens. My two friends had to climb Mt. Washington that day. Afterwords they told me the winds were so strong that they were almost blown over. My hike began and ended at Pinkham Notch, near Gorham, NH. I hiked 12.5 miles.

As I have a fear of heights, the descents were an incredibly intense experience for me. The highlight of the day was being able to photograph a grouse at very close range. Most animals are very skittish around people and immediately flee when a person approaches. The few animals who do not do this will be very tolerant of long term close contact with a person, if you spend the first five minutes of that encounter being very still and quiet. Such was the case with the grouse. It flew into the branches of a nearby evergreen, and its feathers so closely matched the color of the tree bark that even when looking directly at the bird, it was almost invisible. I ate my lunch at Carter Hut, a meal and lodging house run by the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) At the end of the day, I attempted to phone my wife from my cell phone, but I couldn't get thru. Then I noticed a pay phone. I dialed her number and tried to make a collect call. My wife got a request to give her credit card number for a collect call from me in New Hampshire. Since she knew I was already in Maine, she assumed it was a scam and refused the call. We both had a good laugh about it the next time I called my wife.","Route 4, Rangeley, ME

There were only two zero miles days during the entire trek. It was an INCREDIBLY intense experience. This man told me the following story. The first nite he was home in bed with his wife at the conclusion of his hike, he woke up at 2:00 AM with an urgent need to urinate. He was still sound asleep, but neither he or his wife were aware of this. He walked to the corner of his bedroom.The next sound his wife heard was the sound of a liquid hitting the bedroom wall.

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547507,"One of the reasons people hike the AT is to learn some important life lessons. In a zen moment, i got an insight today about one of those very important life lessons. The lesson I learned today is that it does absolutely no good to set your alarm clock to the correct awakening time if you do not also switch another button to the ""on"" position. I awoke at 5:20 AM to the sound of hiking boots walking past my tent, and a great deal more daylight than one would expect at 5:00 AM. This meant I had 40 minutes to dress, take down my tent, eat breakfast, and be ready to hike, or face the wrath of Warren Doyle. The irony is thst Warren, who does not hide his acute dislike of the military, or any other form of government authority, would have made my army boot camp drill sargeant look like a gentle kitten. In Maine, there are several shallow rivers that you ford (walk across). Today, we crossed the Kennebec River that is thigh deep, with a VERY strong current, and lots of very smooth, slippery rocks on the bottom. Years ago, all AT hikers forded the river but now there is a FREE canoe that will ferry you across the river. I rode the canoe across the river. The AT is marked by thousands of rectangular splotches of white paint on trees and rocks. These white paint markings are called blazes. Just so you would know you were still on the AT, there was a white blaze painted on the bottom of the canoe. After I crossed the river, I came to a paved road. A sign informed me that the Sterling Inn was just a quarter of a mile down that road.The temptation was too great, and I headed down that road in search of some REAL food. I discovered that the Sterling Inn has been in continuous operation for 200 years. I dined on a large, everything on it pizza. How many people can say they have eaten a meal at an inn in the USA that has been in continuous operation for 200 years? Later in the day, I paid dearly for my lengthy rest at the Sterling Inn, as I had to hustle to arrive at camp before it got dark. For some reason, it does not bother me to begin my days hike in the dark, but I do not want to end the days hike in the dark.","East Flagstaff Road

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547512,"Today was a long day in terms of mileage (18.5 miles) but the terrain was much gentler in terms of both less rocks and roots on the trail, and less elevation gain or loss. The result was that I finished hiking at the gentlemanly hour of 5:30 PM. However, due to the fact that the van carrying my gear did not arrive until after 7:00 PM, I still ate dinner and set up my tent in the dark. One of the cruel ironies of life, I guess. Today I learned the difference between a pond and a lake in the state of Maine. It has nothing to do with how large the body of water is. Whether a body of water is a pond or a lake depends on how deep it is. If a person can see to the bottom in all parts of the body of water, it is a pond. If this is not possible, it is a lake. Based on this criteria, my guess is that the number of ponds vs lakes in Maine is a function of both a person's eyesight and the clarity of the water. A nearsighted person could justifiably claim that there are far more lakes in Maine than a person with 20/20 vision would claim. Also, a shallow but very murky body of water might be a lake, while a much deeper body of water with clear water would be a pond. Yep, it's no wonder people say that people from Maine are a little bit different. On a different note, I have met hundreds of other hikers on my AT hike. We exchange pleasantries and chat, but few of them make a lasting impression on me. I met a young man today who made a very lasting impression on me (and nearly everyone else who has encountered him.) This young mans trail name (nick name) is Omega. What catches everyone's attention about Omega is his garb. In terms of clothing, I would classify Omega as a minimalist. Omega wears shoes, socks, and underwear. He wears nothing else. I had to ask Omega the obvious question: Why??? His answer: He fears overheating. I assured Omega that given the fact that he is in Maine, and given the fact that he was wearing nothing more than underwear, the chances of him overheating were remote at best. I suspect Omega may have an ulterior motive for his scant clothing. If his motive is to attract the affections of the opposite sex, his attire may chase away the ladies he is attempting to attract. If, on the other hand, he is attempting to attract the attention of other men, this may be an appropriate strategy. One other comment that myself and other people had was that Omega has underwear that is remarkably clean and white, and on the AT, NOBODY has clean clothes. My other memorable hiker encounter was with another young man I met at the summit of Moxie Bald Mountain. The young man told me he was going to finish the AT on Sept 6, and on Sept.8 he is going to be commissioned as a second lieutenant in the army. I am an army veterean, and I was going to caution this young man that life in the military would be VASTLY different from life as an AT hiker, but then he informed me that he had been an enlisted man in the army for 8 years,so I knew he was going into this with his eyes wide open, so I just told him that I wished him luck","A Road Just Past Pierce Pond Lean To

My sole two things to do today are two very pleasant chores:1) catch up with journaling in my blog 2) phoning my wife (I hope she was able to get that rubber matting installed on our bedroom floor). We (Warren Doyle hikers) will end our hike in Baxter State Park (BSP) in Maine. BSP is like no other state park in Maine. It is a very beautiful, very wild state park that was donated to the state of Maine by a very wealthy and very eccentric former governor of Maine, Governor Percival Proctor Baxter, who was Maines governor fron 1921-1924. Governor Baxter donated the land for this state park on the condition that BSP be permanently governed by a three person board, and be exempt fron the rules governing other Maine state parks. A trust fund pays the expenses of BSP. The AT and BSP have a strained and rocky relationship due to the fact that in the past, a small minority of AT hikers have not heeded BSP rules. The AT has been put on notice that further infractions of the rules may result in the AT losing the right to conclude its hike in BSP. Preservation of the parks wilderness, and not recreation is the number one goal of BSP. Governor Baxter had a well deserved reputation as a kindly but eccentric man. He had a succession of Irish Setter pet dogs, all named Gary that he was extremely fond of. While he was the governor of Maine, one of his Gary dogs died. The grief stricken governor ordered flags in the Maine state capitol building to be flown at half mast. Mainers did not think this was a good idea.

On his 2015 trip, he took hikers the entire length of the AT. One of the men who did that hike is also on this hike, and he told me the following story. It was Sept. 8, 2015, the birthday of a woman who was also doing the entire 2200 mile hike with the Warren Doyle group 
While doing her daily hike on the AT (on her birthday) she lost her footing and fell, breaking her wrist. (Quite a birthday surprise, wouldn't you say?) At that point, she had already hiked over 2000 miles, so she was a seasoned hiker.The other hikers from her group found two suitable sticks and that became an emergency splint. Another hiker had some duct tape, and that was used to fasten the splint to her arm. Another hiker had a bandanna, and that became an emergency sling. She never shed a single tear ( until she reached the vehicle at the end of the days hike, and those were tears of frustration, because she was less than 200 miles from the finish.) The vehicle transported her to a medical facility, where her wrist was set into a plaster cast. To the astonishment of everyone, she decided to continue the hike. During these 140 day long Warren Doyle hikes, some incredibly strong bonds of friendship are forged among the hikers, and the other hikers rallied around her. Friends set up and took down her tent, and did various other chores for her. Recently, we ( the members of this 2016 trip) did a very long day, involving an incredibly steep and dangerous descent. I was very freaked out doing this descent. This woman did that descent in pouring rain, after dark, arriving at camp at 10;30 PM. My friend, who was with her that day, is a very strong hiker and could have finished the days hike hours earlier, but he refused to leave her side until she arrived safely in camp at 10;30 that night. That woman also ascended and descended Mt. Katadhin, arguably the toughest one day of the entire AT with her broken wrist in a sling.

He has hiked the entire AT an astonishing 17 times, and is closing in on completing his 18'th AT hike. I have heard that he is one of the co-founders of ALDHA (a hiking organization), and at one time he held the record for the fastest completion of the AT. Warren loves pastries and jelly donuts, and being a very generous man, he shares those treats with the hikers in his group. Warren is not out to make a quick buck, and his hiking trips are very reasonably priced. Warren's other passion in life (besides hiking) is dancing, and I have heard that he is an incredibly skilled dancer. Having said all those nice things about Warren, I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that nobody has ever referred to Warren as Saint Warren. When he becomes upset, Warren can be quick tempered, and Warren is no shrinking violet, being not at all shy about expressing his sometimes very blunt thoughts. One day, one of the hikers committed two infractions that highly displeased Warren. The next morning, at our daily hiking briefing, Warren cut loose and in my opinion blasted the entire group for two infractions that only one person had innocently done. Maybe it was my imagination, but I could swear I saw steam pouring out of Warren's ears! At the end of Warren's steamy sermon, he asked if there vwere any questions. No sensible person, after hearing Warren's tirade, would have asked a question. Incredibly, one of the hikers DID have a question. Before I reveal this person's INCREDIBLE question, some additional background information woild be helpful: 1) Warren is a fanatic about hikers beginning their hike exactly on time. 2) Warren has expressed his opinion that cooking breakfast is a waste of very valuable time. Our brave (but not very diplomatic) hiker asked Warren if he (the naive hiker) had enough time to cook up some oatmeal before starting the day's hike. It got even quieter for a very long moment. Warren, to his credit, calmly told this hiker that was not a good idea.

As a result of this late start, I have a picture of the hiker (who in my last posting asked Warren if he had time to cook up some oatmeal,) seated on the ground and very happily munching on his beloved oatmeal! Yesterday, from the summit of White Top Mt. we caught our first glimpse of Mt. Katadhin, the terminus of the AT. Gene, who hiked the entire AT last year with Warren, had a picture of Mt. Katadhin that he carried with him on that hike and looked at it every day to keep himself motivated. My motivation trick was to draw a picture of a mountain on an index card with the word ""Katadhin"" written on it. That index card sat on my bathroom mirror ledge for months prior to the start of my AT hike. So for both Gene and myself, the first time we actually saw Mt. Katadhin was a very powerful experience. I ate my lunch at the top of White Cap Mt, looking at Katadhin. Apparently, seeing Katadhin for the first time was also a very motivating experience for the two twenty somethings who ate lunch directly behind me. They celebrated the occasion by ""smoking a bowl."" As an old fart, I was not offered a courtesy puff, but that's ok, I would have declined had I been asked. Today we passed Cooper Brook Lean To (in Maine, shelters are called Lean To's) which gets my vote for the best shelter of the entire AT.

Gene disagreed, saying such a meal should end with strawberry shortcake (with homegrown fresh strawberries), and we argued about the merits of our respective desserts.

It was 2 miles later when I discovered my mistake, which meant I climbed a very tough mountain twice, and added an extra four miles to my hike the day before a really tough hike. Boy, did I feel foolish! Early in the days hike, I was hiking with my friends when we came to the Wadleigh Stream Lean To. There was a plaque on the wall of that shelter in honor of ""Buffalo Bobby"", who on Sept. 29, 2011, died very close to that shelter, just 38 miles short of completing his third AT hike. There was an abandoned and weathered back pack at the shelter that we surmised might have been ""Buffalo Bobby's"", and left there as a momento by Bobby's loved ones. There were also ashes from an extinguished campfire at the shelter. One of my hiking buddies suggessted that we fill the abandoned back pack with campfire ashes and attach a note to the abandoned back pack saying those were Buffalo Bobby's ashes, thus insuring that the backpack and the ashes would remain there forever. My question is: Does hiking the AT make a person twisted and perverse, or is it only twisted and perverse people who hike the AT? When I got turned around on that mountain top, and ended up back at the shelter with a plaque to Buffalo Bobby, I realized my mistake. I arrived at camp at 5:00 PM, hours after evryone else.

Charles was on his second day of a 2-3 month hike that will hopefully take him from Katadhin to Harpers Ferry. Because it was only day two of his hike, Charles was wearing clothes that were both clean and new. He also had no body odor. He deffinitely did NOT look(or smell) like a long distance hiker. Charles had been following my blog and by also talking with other hikers who knew me, he knew that our paths would cross that day.

We did this because two hikers in our group are going to summit Katadhin Mt, today, and as it is one of the toughest days of the entire AT, they need as much time as possible.(Tomorrow, the rest of us will summit Katadhin.) I have a very sad story to tell today about a 66 year old woman whose trail name was Inchworm who died a very tragic death on the AT in 2013. Several thousand people hike all or part of the AT every year and as a result, there is a well founded fear that the AT will become overused. To prevent this, the AT authorities stress a program called ""Leave No Trace."" This policy states that hikers need to minimize their impact on the AT so that future hikers can also enjoy an unspoiled wilderness.This means leaving no litter, and packing out whatever you pack in. A privy is provided at every shelter, but sometimes ""nature calls"" when a person is not close to a privy. When this happens, the ""Leave No Trace"" people advise that the person go a minimum of 200 feet off the trail, dig a 6 inch 
hole, and do what they need to do. Inch worm went a great deal off the trail for a bathroom visit, and then couldn't find her way back to the trail. She was lost in one of the wildest parts of Maine. The largest search in the history of that part of the state was organized, unsuccessfully. Inch worm climbed to a high mountaintop, and stayed there. Supposedly, on a few occasions, seachers came within 100 yards of Inchworm without discovering her. Inchworm was 10 minutes away from a path that turned into a road that led to civilization. Her body was not discovered for a few years. They then discovered, by writings in her journal that she had survived for at least 26 days after she got lost.","Abol Stream

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548518,"Our hike began at 5;30 AM, in the dark, with our headlamps on. We all had an enormous adrenaline rush, as today we had an incredibly tough climb to the top of Katadhin Mt. My day got off to a bad start, as I nearly lost my hiking pole down a steep slope when I paused to photogragh a beautiful waterfall. If I had been smart, I would have listened to my friend Charles advice, and left my hiking pole behind, as a hiking pole was worse than useless on an incredibly steep, 4000 foot elevation gain in 4 miles. What we did for a good portion of the hike was a hand over hand nearly vertical rock scramble. They say you will either love or hate the summit of Katadhin. I have a terrible fear of heights, and I was about as scared as I have ever been. Most of my hiking buddies LOVED the climb. The nearly vertical climb over the rocks is marked by white rectangular paint sprayings on the rocks which are called blazes. ""You gotta be kidding me"" was my constant thought as I scrambled up and up and up. About two miles from the summit, I got a very pleasant surprise. The nearly vertical ascent was over, and the rest of the climb was not tough or scary at all. One mile from the top is the last of the thousands of streams along the AT. It is called Thoreau Stream, in honor of Henry David Thoreau. Ironically, it was one of a very few streams that I absolutely would NOT drink from, as the water was very murky and swampy. One of my hiking buddies, who I guess is a romantic at heart, insisted on filtering and drinking the questionable water even though I offered him some of my water. I asked him if he felt philisophical after his drink, but he said he felt no such affect. I arrived at the summit at 10:00 AM. Myself and my friends stayed at the summit for half an hour, and then began our descent. We could not have asked for a more perfect day. It was 70 degrees, and there was not a cloud in the sky. We could see for miles in all directions. On the advice of Warren, we descended via a different trail called the Abol Trail. Ironically, the descent was less scary than the ascent. Myself and my hiking buddies descended very slowly and very carefully, often sliding down rocks on the seat of our pants. Usually, the rocks at the beginning of a descent are the scariest and most dangerous, and by the time you get down to tree level, it gets easier. Today it was the opposite. The incredibly steep loose dirt below tree line was very treacherous. Gene was the only one to actually fall, although all of us had many near falls. We arrived back at the parking lot at 2;30 PM. All I had eaten all day was a Danish pastry and a small bag of potato chips. We had dinner that night in an Italian Restaurant. I had chicken and broccoli Alfredo and a small salad. To my astonishment, I could not finish my meal, and afterwards, I had a horrible stomach ache, which I attributed to being scared out of my gord for most of the day.","Katadhin Stream Campground

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548522,"Today was a very long day for me. Warren Doyle's hike ended when we summitted Katadhin, but one person from that hike, Ron and I spent the night in ""Ole Man"" and ""Navigator"" hiker hostel in Millinocket, ME. We got up at 3;45 AM, and drove to Andover, ME, because I had one day of hiking that I had missed and needed to make up. The day I did Mahoosuc Notch, Mahoosuc Arm, and climbed Old Speck Mt., also one of the most difficult days of the AT, I got extremely sick. I was gasping for breath for most of that day, even when at rest. I attribute that to a combination of several days of extreme exertion, coupled with poor nutrition, and I smply ran out of fuel. I took the next day off (while everyone else hiked that day.) That was the day I needed to make up. Ron and I arrived at the start of my makeup hike just as the grey, leaden sky began to rain very heavily. I began hiking anyway, in the heavy rain, and Ron drove off, to meet me at the end of my 10 mile hike. The weather got worse, not better. The rain got very heavy, with LOTS of thunder. I had to cross two high mountains that day, Bald pate East, and Bald Pate West. As you can guess, they are called Bald Pate because the top of one of the mountains is above tree line. I was concerned that at the mountaintop, the thunder would be lightening, and being above treeline, the highest object at the top of the mountain would be me, and catching lightening bolts is not my idea of a good time. half way along my hike was a shelter, and I made an emergency decision that if the lightening had not ceased by the time I reached the shelter, I would make a u-turn and return to my starting point and hitch hike to where Ron, my ride was waiting for me. I prayed that God would do me a favor and make the thunder go away. (I was willing to hike in a driving rain, but not an electrical storm.) Well, perhaps it was just a coincidence, or perhaps not, but to my utter astonishment, not only did the thunder cease, but so did the rain, and then the sun came out, and a very strong wind blew the clouds away. I have never seen clouds move as quickly as they did yesterday. However, those VERY strong winds were as much a curse as they were a blessing. When I got to the top of the mountain, the wind was so strong that I could not stand up, and I had to do a reverse crab walk down hill on 200 yards of exposed rock. I got two very pleasant surprises on yesterdays hike. When I was on top of that windy mountain, very freaked out, I heard a female voice saying ""Marshmellow, is that you?"" It was a hiking friend, whose trail name is Furiosa. She is a nurse and an incredibly strong and fast hiker. A few miles later I passed an old, gaunt, emaciated looking man going in the opposite direction from me. As soon as he passed me, I thought, ""wait a minute, I know that guy."" So I asked him if his trail name was ""White Owl."" It was indeed my friend White Owl, almost finished with his AT hike at age 70. The reason I hardly recognized him is because he has lost 30 pounds since I last saw him. Hikers on the AT love to play practical jokes on each other. White Owl is a very folksy, grandfatherly person that everyone likes. He and I attended a free, all you can eat pancake and bacon breakfast sponsored by a church in Franklin, N.C. The church provided free, stamped envelopes so hikers could write brief messages to loved ones to let them know they were ok, and to advise family of their progress. When the letters were completed, they were put on a table, and the church said they would mail them. White Owl was sitting at a table with 10-12 twenty somethings that he was hiking with and had befreinded. Unknown to him, one of the young guys stole White Owls letter, and all of them copied White Owls address, and wrote brief letters to his wife, giving their trail nicknames, and assuring White Owl's wife that all was well with them. All of this was unknown to White Owl. A week later, White Owl got a phone call from his wife, asking who all these people were that he was hanging out with. White Owl told his wife that he knew who all those people were, but he had no idea how they got his wife's address. He asked one of the culprits what had happened, and the kid fessed up to the foul trick he and his buddies had played on White Owl. None of their notes were offensive in any way, so White Owl and his wife had a good laugh over the practical joke."," The Summit Of Katadhin Mountain

Every year, I do a 6 day hike around Lake Okeechobee in south Florida organized by a great guy named Roy. At last years hike, I met a man who has hiked the entire AT. He said his favorite state was Maine. I have not yet completed the entire AT, so perhaps I will see a more beautiful state, but I doubt any of the remaining states can top Maine, What has impressed me the most about Maine is the utter silence, quiet, and peace of the Maine woods, which can last for hours at a time. When I walk the AT, often the only sound I hear is my footsteps. When I stop walking, there is utter silence and peace. The other thing about Maine that has totally blown me away are the many very beautiful lakes, many of them utterly deserted, and filled with the beautiful callings of loons. My only disappointment with Maine is that I have not seen a single moose. However, as a consolation prize, yesterday evening, near dusk, as Ron and I drove down a two lane wooded Maine road, I saw what appeared to be a very large rock in the middle of the road. As we got closer, I noticed that the ""rock"" was moving. As we got closer still, I noticed that the ""rock"" was actually an alligator snapping turtle, the meanest, nastiest turtle I had ever seen. I wanted to move the turtle off the road so a car wouldn't hit it, but that alligator snapping turtle would have bitten my hand off!","Grafton Notch, Maine

Tomorrow, for the first time since August 5, I will have a full pack. It has been fun slack packing with the same people for a month, and I will miss them and the good times we had. Also, I am betting that for the first few days, my fully loaded pack will feel like it weighs a thousand pounds. The biggest disadvantage to Warren Doyle's hike was that as the slowest hiker, I always felt pressured to finish the day's hike as quickly as possible. As a solo hiker today, I felt no such pressure, and that was a good feeling. I went thru my pack today and sent home everything I felt I no longer need. I think I lightened my pack by 5 pounds. The other big change is that for the remainder of my hike, I will be hiking south, hoping to complete the hike before cold weather forces me off the trail.I have about 430 miles left to do. Most hikers end their hikes at one of two interesting places, either Mt. Katadhin or Springer Mt. Because I flip-floped, I have summited both of these mo untains. My hike will end in the parking lot of (drum roll, please) Wits End Taverne in Unionville, NY. I kid you not. I don't even need to conquer a gentle rise to get to it.

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548914,"Hiking with Warren Doyle spoiled me. I got very used to hiking with just a day pack. When I finished Warrens hike, I went through all of my gear and mailed home everything I didnt need. As a result, I thought my pack weight would be greatly reduced. However, when I weighed my pack, I got a nasty surprise. With three days of food, my pack weighed 40 pounds. After having just a day pack for a month, 40 pounds felt like a TON. The other nasty surprise I got was that for the first time in 6 months, animals ate part of my food. Every nite I put all of my food into a special bag and hang it from a tree. The irony is that animals did not get my food when I was in the woods. Nope, they got it when I slept indoors in a hiker hostel. The first nite I was there and lying on my bunk, I heard the scurrying of little feet, so I knew there was a rodent problem. The next morning I discovered that my food had been attacked by health conscious mice.I had some regular tortillas and some whole grain tortillas. Only the whole grain tortillas were partially eaten. I thought that was the only food the mice gotten to, but a few days later I got a nasty surprise. I had a package of M&M candies, and I noticed that several pieces of candy were loose in my food bag, so I munched happily on them. Then I discovered that mice had chewed two holes in the candy package. I threw the rest of the candies away, and I did not get sick as a result of sharing my candy treat with mice. It was a bad luck day for me all day long. I did not get started hiking until 10:00AM, a very late start for me. I was struggling up Cube Mt. with my 40 pound pack. As a result of my late start, I planned to hike only ten miles, but alas, I fell far short of even that modest goal. A hiker I had met the previous day warned me that the summit of Cube Mt. looked like an angry giant had thrown giant boulders in every direction. To make matters worse, a freezing and hard rain began to fall, making those giant boulders even more treacherous to cross.I was completely soaked and very cold, so at 2:00 PM, I called it quits for the day at Hexacuba Shelter.

During their visit, Bill would invite his victims, I mean guests to join him in a friendly game of croquet, and this elderly gentleman would then proceed to beat the pants off them. Very few hikers were able to beat DR. Bill in a game of croquet. I don't know, maybe he slipped something into that free ice cream. Today I passed a young lady who was hiking the AT barefoot. Several years ago, there were two sisters who hiked the entire AT barefoot. They were called the Barefoot sisters. (There is some dispute as to whether they hiked every single mile barefoot) When they reached the end of their hike in Maine, they decided to turn around and repeat the entire hike in reverse back to Georgia. When you hike over 2000 miles with a person, no matter how pleasant that person is, tensions are going to build up. Each sister noticed certain characteristics about her sibling that irked her, but she kept quiet, because the hike was supposed to end in Maine. However, when Maine turned out merely to be the half way point, those long simmering frustrations each sibling had boiled to the surface. The girls have written two books, each book telling of one half of their hike. I have not read those books, but I am told they make for interesting reading.","Trapper John Shelter.

Today the AT passed thru the town of Hanover, NH, which is the home of Dartmouth University, an Ivy League college. When I was in college I read a novel by Ayn Rand called Atlas Shrugged. One of the characters of that novel was a shadowy super hero named John Galt. Not much was known about this superhero, so the question everyone was asking was""Who is John Galt?"" Well, I didn't know it, but Dartmouth University also has a super hero. His name is Fred Glickman. Everywhere you go on campus, there are HUGE banners and signs asking: ""Who is Fred Glickman?"" Well, I did a little research and it turns out that Fred Glickman is an actual Dartmouth alumni who graduated in the 1960's. He is now a practicing attorney in Miami who heroically rescues clients from legal pitfalls. Every super hero has a super hero costume, and Fred is no exception. When he does his heroic legal manuevers, Fred is decked out in bicycling shorts and a bicycling jersey. Just as Batman has a side kick named Robin, Fred has a sidekick named Around The World Bill (ATWB) Not much is known about ATWB, except for the fact that he is an affable but eccentric fellow who is prone to taking long walks.

I knew when I started this hike that a day would come when I wanted this hike to be over with. Well, it seems that day has finally arrived. I am still having fun, but I will not be sad when the hike is finished.There was a little bit of a letdown for me when I finished with Warren Doyles hike, and instead of hiking with a group of people, I was again hiking alone, but there was the excitement of finishing up the incredibly tough state of NH and getting into Vermont. Well, I have done that ( crossed over into Vermont) where I got an unpleasant surprise. Vermont while much easier than NH, it (Vermont) is still INCREDIBLY tough. The climbs and descents are VERY steep and frequent and the trail is very rooty and rocky and slow going. Yesterday, it took me 11 hours to hike 15 miles. Little things that shouldn't bother me are starting to bother me.My tent has two zippered doors on it. Both of them are broken. I am getting very tired of struggling up and down very steep endless hills. Fortunately, in 100 miles, I cross over into Massachusetts where there is less climbing. Yesterday I woke up to a hard rain. I shut off my alarm clock and went back to sleeo. That was both a good and bad idea. On the bright side when I woke up again at 7:00 AM the rain had stopped. On the bad side by the time I reached camp it was dusk and I cooked and ate dinner in the dark. Ok, readers, now that I have cried on your shoulders (hopefully I have not bummed you out) let me tell you about a bright event. I crossed over the Conneticut River and into the quaint and charming Vermont hamlet of Norwich. There at the gas station was a 1941 Cadillac. The car was 75 years old.

When I awoke this morning it was light out and 7:00 AM. Somehow, during the nite, my alarm clock battery got barred loose. Rats! There is a very famous hotel/restaurant just half a mile off the AT that another hiker had warned me NOT to miss. I took his advice and had lunch there. It is called the Inn at the Long Trail. It is very rustic and charming.There is an Irish pub there that is SO Irish, you would swear you were in Ireland. Ok, now on to a humorous story. My wife, Ginny had been taking yoga classes for many years. Occasionally it happens that a class is composed of only women. When that happens, the topics of conversation are VASTLY different from topics of conversation when one or more men are in the class. The other nite I arrived at a shelter. and when I got close to the shelter, I could hear half a dozen women chatting happily among themselves. Have any of you ever owned a pet parakeet? The bird will be chirping merrily away, but when you throw a towel over the parakeets cage at dusk, you get complete silince. When I walked into the women only shelter, it was as if someone had thrown a blanket over the parakeet cage. I felt like the Grinch who stole Christmas. The next morning at breakfast when I told the story of my errant tooth crown one of the ladies said she was a dental hygenist, and incredibly she had a tube of tooth cement that she offered to let me use for a do it yourself repair job. I got a mental picture of the poor dentist cussing me out as he fixed my botched repair job and declined her generous offer.I have one more funny story. Today, in the middle of the forest, I had a DESPERATE need to use the bathroom. I got out my trowel and frantically began to dig a hole. The hole is supposed to be a minimum of six inches deep. To my horror, although my need was extremely urgent, I got a very large rock very early into my frantic dig. In desperation, I reached in with my hands and extracted a HUGE rock. I had dug by FAR the best cat hole I had ever dug during my entire AT hike. I kid you not, I was actually proud of my construction project. Then I got another big surprise.

A few hours later, as I sat eating my lunch, I saw a very small sign that gave me the "" heebie jeebies."" The sign said the fire tower was closed and anyone who climbed the tower was subject to a fine of up to FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS!!! There was NO sign on the fire tower warning people of this fact, nor was there any sign warning southbound hikers of this fact before they arrived at the fire tower. In a previous post to this blog I told of how I had been fined $150 for camping in an area where I had a permit to camp, and where BEFORE pitching my tent, I asked a ranger where I was allowed to camp, and then pitching my tent where he told me to pitch it. I appealed my fine to the authorities in Washington DC, and the fine was upheld, because "" I should have known better than to camp there!"" I could just see some bureaucrat fining me $5000 for climbing a tower that had NO sign telling me it was closed because ""I should have known the fire tower was closed.""

The first nite I was there they had a free 2 hour live music concert with a hammer dulcimer, flute, guitar, and tambourine where they played Appalachian mountain music. The food in their deli is legendary. I ordered a strawberry smoothie with my meal at the Yellow Deli and it was delicious. When I tried to pay for it, they told me it (the smoothie) was on the house! They do not charge to stay at the hostel, it is by whatever donation you care to give. The people who run the Yellow Deli Hiker Hostel were very friendly and gracious, and I experienced no pressure to become a member of their religious community. Yesterday, I said it was a perfect day for me. My luck did not continue for a second day. Yes, it is WONDERFUL to slack pack, but the next day, when you put your fully loaded backpack on (heavier than usual, because I had just resupplied with three days worth of food), it feels like it weighs a TON. , and I began my hike with a very long and steep uphill climb. The bus I needed to take to the start of the hike did not run on weekends, so I called Tom, who is a former AT hiker who for a very reasonable five dollar fee shuttles hikers to the start of the hike. When I called Tom, he said he would not be able to pick me up until 10:00 AM, so I got a very late start. Today was the first day I would be hiking without my tent (I mailed it ahead to North Adams Massachusetts) so I will be limited to sleeping only in shelters until then. Just my luck, the first cold snap of fall rolled in that nite, and I slept wearing every stitch of clothing I own, which was just enough to keep me very warm. In the morning it was 39 degrees! If the filter to my water purification system freezes, it no longer works, so I put it inside my sleeping bag that nite. The advantage to not carrying a tent is that it makes my pack lighter for those long, steep climbs/descents over the Green Mountains. The disadvantage is that I can only sleep in shelters, which means less miles hiked each day. I am starting to think that maybe shipping my tent ahead was not a very good idea.","Twelve Tribes Hiker Hostel

I got on the trail by 7:20 AM, and only one thing could have prevented me from reaching my destination. That one thing was miles and miles of half buried boulders on the hiking trail, and that's exactly what I got. By the time I reached Lost Pond Shelter, it was 3:00 PM. Peru Peaks was another 4.7 miles away. If the trail continued to be extremely rocky, it meant I would arrive after dark, and tonite was another very cold nite. I decided to play it safe and call it quits for the day. (The next day I discovered that the extreme rockiness ceased after Lost Pond Shelter. Had I continued, I would have reached the shelter with plenty of daylight left!) Oh well, better to be safe than sorry.) At nite, I put all of my food in a sack and hang it from a tree to keep animals from eating it. I have a very small sack that I fill with rocks, then tie to the end of a rope. I throw the rock filled sack over a high up tree branch and then hoist my food bag up the tree. I have been doing this for 6 months without a problem. Today I got a tree that decided to fight back. My rock bag got wedged between two braches that formed a ""V"", and it was too high up for me to reach. I dragged a picnic table to the defiant tree, stood on top of the picnic table, (which was not on level ground, and thus very wobbly) . and stretched my hiking pole up to the rock sack and tried to nudge the rock sack back over the top of the branch, while also trying not to fall off the wobbly picnic table. (I was great entertainment for the other hikers staying at the shelter.) They were of the opinion that I would not be able to retrieve my rock sack. They were wrong. After about half an hour, I finally got my rock sack back. I really need that rock sack, so I had to keep trying until I got it back. My triumph was very short lived, however. I had a water bottle just inside the shelter. It fell to the ground below, shattering the lid. That meant I had only one water bottle left, which is not enough water for hiking. I got a Trail Magic Miracle, because another hiker at the shelter had an extra empty water bottle that she gave to me. I could not have been more grateful for her gift ifitI was a bar of gold!

Yet because the AT was relatively boulder free, I was able to hike a long distance. There are four people from my bicycle club, Fred Glickman (he was the subject of a previous humorous posting on this blog), Bob, Joe, and Susan who are taking a mini vacation out to NH, and they decided to try to meet me somewhere on the AT. I also have a friend from my year long, around the world bike trip (Ron Molino) who invited me to stay at his house in Manchester Center, Vt. The only place that all 6 of us could meet was at Manchester Center. I was 3 miles from the end of my hike to Manchester Center. I had just summited Mt. Bromley, when I heard someone call out my name. It was my friend Bob, who along with Fred had climbed the mountain, hoping they would meet me. Bob asked if I was surprised to see him there, and surprised was an understatement! Bob and I and several other people from my biking club have gone on several of Bob's MAGNIFICENT kayaking trips. (On one such trip, we were deep in the Everglades, and did not end our trip until 11:30 PM, but that's another story) Bob has only one unbending rule for his kayaking trips. That rule is that there WILL be a happy hour during that trip. So I was not at all surprised when Bob pulled out a bottle of wine and three wine glasses and Bob, Fred, and I drained that bottle at the summit of Mt. Bromley and snapped pictures. I said that finding Bob on that mountaintop was a little bit like Stanley finding Dr. Livingston in the middle of Africa, and Bob said he had the same thought. We drank one bottle of wine between three people, so I did not drink that much wine, but I had not eaten much food all day, and to my astonishment, I was SMASHED and I still had to walk 2.5 miles and a 700 foot descent and as usual there were LOTS of roots and rocks on the AT, so it was an interesting descent! Bob asked Ron for a ""very Vermont"" place for the 6 of us to have dinner. Ron suggested a 226 year old tavern called ""Ye Olde Tavern' and it was just like one of those quaint, charming places that have a lot of atmosphere that you see on tv about New England. Unfortunately, during dinner, I got an upset stomach, which cleared up shortly after I got back to Ron's house.

Ron said there were more people watching the debate than there were watching the super bowl! I have been hiking the AT for over 6 months, and during that time I have watched very little tv, so I don't know much about what either of the two candidates have said or done. I felt the first debate was an UTTER failure, due to the fact that the person asking the questions was timid as a church mouse. He asked Mr. Trump only one tough question, about Mr. Trumps change regarding President Obama's country of birth. He asked Mrs. Clinton NO HARD QUESTIONS WHATSOEVER! The Founders of this country meant for the Press to be the fourth branch of the government, the one that reports on the misdeeds of the three branches. If the moderator is too timid to ask all candidates the tough questions, the debate can ONLY be a total failure. My other observation was that neither Mr. Trump (Republican Party) or Mrs. Clinton (Goldman Sachs/Oligarchs Party) deserves my vote. I will hold my nose and vote for Mr. Trump, but only because I believe that Mrs. Clinton is an even WORSE candidate, who seems hell bent on blundering the US into a nuclear war with Russia and possibly China as well. When you refer to Putin as ""the new Hitler"" and do LOTS of nuclear saber rattling, as Mrs. Clinton has done, that's not good. Mrs. Clinton also has many unanswered questions about her 33,000 deleted emails, her running of the state department as a pay to play game for the Clinton Foundation, and her health, and the poor, timid church mouse running the debate was too cowardly to ask a single tough question of her. The US is massing more troops on Russia's border than at any time since World War Two. Russia is terrified and preparing for war. If World war Three happens, it may mean the end of all life on planet Earth. And the poor, timid press utters not a single word about this?

This means that I average ten miles per day, or less, whereas if I have my tent, I can camp at ANY campsite, and do more miles per day. The other reason mailing my tent ahead was a mistake is that it suddenly started getting very cold at nite and the wooden shelters only have three walls, so they are not nearly as warm as my tent.

I would like to add that sometimes the best way to prevent yourself from looking bad is to keep your mouth shut. Here is an example of that.I spent a few days hiking with two guys in their mid twenties. One of the young men told me that he had to use the woods bathroom so urgently that he narrowly avoided an unpleasant outcome. Ok, fair enough. That's just chatter among the boys. Each shelter has a notebook where hikers can post their thoughts. This young man changed his story and proudly BOASTED that he had soiled himself. The fact that he had (possibly) soiled himself would not of itself cause him to lose stature among the other hikers, because we all have had bathroom emergencies. However, the fact that he BOASTED about it and then signed his trail name will make him look like an idiot to other hikers, and the AT grapevine is very strong among AT hikers. When two or more hikers meet, they almost always stop to exchange pleasantries.

Mike is a 72 year old man who has just finished hiking the 275 mile Long Trail. Most people take from 14-17 days to hike the Long Trail. Mike says he hiked 4-5 miles per day. At that rate, it would have taken Mike 68 days to hike this trail. Mike says he does not eat much food when he hikes. Either this is the case, or Mike frequently leaves the trail to resupply, or he carries many days of food with him.Mike says that meeting and talking to other hikers is much more important to him than hiking many miles per day.Hmmm.

One day, one of Matias sons asked her, ""mom,how do you know whether or not they are married?"" Matias response was that she did not ask to see a marraige license. The son then retorted that it seemed to him that a double standard was being applied here. It seemed to be ok for unmarried boarders to sleep together, but not for Mariad sons to sleep with their unmarried girlfriends. Maria replied that boarders were not family. The son ( Who Maria called the family wise guy) then asked,""mom, would it have been ok if were paying boarders?"" @ Yep, there's one in every family.","Salisbury,Ct.

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550560,"Hiking the AT changes you in subtle ways that you cannot anticipate. One of the ways I have heard many hikers say they have been changed is in the way they look at food. The other day, I was eating a handful of gorp (good old raisins and peanuts) when an almond fell into the dirt. Before I began my AT hike, if a morsel of food fell into the dirt, I never gave it another moments thought. I stared at that almond for the longest time, and it took a lot of will power to resist the urge to pick it up and eat it. A female hiker told me that for the 25 years of her married life, she had a terrible phobia about germs, and she NEVER ate any of her husband's food. One nite very recently she and her husband were having dinner together in a restaurant. (This woman has less than 100 miles left to hike on the AT). The husband was not going to finish his dessert, so the woman not only finished his dessert, but she used his dessert spoon to finish eating it.My other observation is that today I relearned a lesson I have been taught on more than one occasion during my AT hike. The standard wisdom is that NONE of the AT is easy, but parts of it are less difficult than other parts. Everybody told me that Conneticut was an easy state, and sure enough, I had three easy days in a row. Today was a day from hell, so I guess I relearned an old lesson today.","Shannon Mountain Campsite

That school is called Eton.I think I may have stumbled upon the Eton of Conneticut today. I stopped in Kent to buy some food when I passed the Kent School, established 1906. It is a boarding school for high school kids.Looking at that uber plush campus, I am guessing it costs as much per year (or maybe more) as Harvard. The kids there wear uniforms including a tie. I asked one of the students that I encountered a few questions about the school. The kid never stopped walking and it was pretty obvious he didn't want to talk to me and I can't say I blame him.The kid smelled like someone had dumped an entire bottle of cologne on him. I on the other hand looked and smelled like a homeless guy. I wonder if the kids name was Biff or Collingsworth?

At the Wiley Shelter, I encountered two middle aged Jewish ladies who had brought their HUGE ""I just met you two seconds ago, but you are my best friend, so please pet me and play games with me"" dog. I LOVE dogs like that, but the ladies were afraid I might be put off by their dogs over friendliness, so they scolded the dog and told it not to be a noodge. I remember the first time I was called a noodge. I was working on my masters degree and one day one of my instructors ( Ill call her Dr. Jones) gave me some very scholarly advice.She said , "" Bill,stop being such a noodge."" I had no idea what a noodge was,but I knew Dr.Jones was Jewish, so I told a Jewish friend what Dr. Jones had said to me and I asked what a noodge is.My friend just laughed and said it was very hard to put into words what a noodge is, but she assured me I was the very personification of what a noodge is.

He said that even during his one day hike he had plenty of time to be alone with his thoughts, and he wondered what seven months of hiking had taught me about life. I have had no profound, earth shattering discoveries. One thing I have come to understand is that every person is important and deserves to be treated with courtesy and respect. Here is a funny thing that happened to me today. I decided to take a short day of hiking and go into town to accomplish only two goals. One goal was to resupply with food. My other goal was to spend time catching up on my blog. While eating lunch,i was approached by an elderly man who asked if I was a hiker. I said yes, I am, and this elderly man then launched into a lengthy discussion about a tv program he had seen about the AT. I DESPERATELY wanted time to work on my blog, but I was very polite to the old man and answered all of his questions enthusiastically and in great detail. I then walked to the grocery store and discovered that the store was a few miles from my hotel, and most of the afternoon would be eaten up just walking to and from the store. While paying for my groceries at the store, I discovered that the elderly man I had chatted with at the restaurant was standing right behind me waiting to pay for his groceries. He then offered me a ride back to my hotel, saving me a great deal of time, which I then used to catch up on my blog! If I had blown the man off, this would never have happened.

I have had a problem in Massachusetts, Conneticut,and New York in finding enough water to drink and cook with. All of my water comes from streams, and many of them dry up in the middle of summer. For several days I had the frustrating problem of having a plentiful water source that was unusable. I followed a river for several days, but there was an advisory not to eat any fish caught from the river due to high levels of PCB. I figured if the fish were unfit to eat, the water was probably also unsafe.So I got water however I could. If the AT crossed a road and there were houses or businesses,I asked if I could fill my water bottles and I was never turned down. If a business had a restroom, I got my water from the sink ( did you think I was going to say toilet?) in the restroom.

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550741,"On several occasions during my AT hike, as I lay in my tent in the woods at nite, I would on very infrequent occasions hear a very eerie sound that sounded like a child screaming.I knew the sound was made by an animal, not a human,but I could never figure out what animal was making that sound. Well, I heard that sound again last night, and the sound ended with a very familiar owl hoot. Aha, mystery solved. Today I did a very steep descent onto a HUGE and impressive bridge that spans the equally impressive Hudson River into the town of Fort Montgomery, NY. Tomorrow, the AT will take me thru a zoo (I am not kidding about this) and the lowest elevation point on the AT at 177 feet. ( followed immediately by a 1100 foot climb) I got a very pleasant surprise today. I ran into an old hiking friend from a couple of months ago. Her trail name is Dulce, because she plays a musical instrument called the hammer dulcimer. Dulce is a strong hiker and I assumed she had already completed her hike, but she had a health setback due to some kidney stones, which took her off the trail for a few weeks. She has about 100 more miles of hiking left than I do ( I have a total of 60 miles left to hike.) Ok, I'll end today's narrative with two garter snake encounters I recently had. The first involved a very slow and sluggish snake that slithered off the AT as I passed it. It had been a cold nite so I figured that was the reason for the snakes sluggishness early in the morning. Then I noticed a very large bulge in the middle of the snakes body. I think it had just finished breakfast, and that's why it was sluggish.My second garter snake tail (pun intended) involves a snake I startled. I noticed a frog frantically hopping away from the startled snake. I suspect the snake had captured the frog and was about to have breakfast when I came by and ruined everything. To the grateful frog, I probably seemed like a very decent fellow. I don't think the snake shared that opinion. Oh well, you can't please everyone!","SouthHighland Road

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550992,"For the past several days, I have had WONDERFUL weather, temperatures in the low 80's. I was actually sweating as I hiked. I knew this gift was summers last gasp, and that the great weather would end all too soon. It ended this morning, with a steady rain all day long. Fortunately, the temperatures were still high, so as long as I was hiking, I stayed warm. I hiked out of Fort Montgomery today. One of the things I have looked forward to for this entire hike was my walk thru the zoo in Ft. Montgomery. Unfortunately, the zoo did not open until 10;00 A.M., and with the shortened hours before it gets dark, I could not afford to wait. Another disappointment was that today I was supposed to have had views from the AT of the New York City skyline. Unfortunately, due to the rain and intense fog, I saw nothing. People often ask me what I think about all day as I hike along. Often as I am hiking, songs that reflect my current situation at the time will pop into my mind, and stay there for several hours. So today, as I hiked in an all day steady rain, the song ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"", by Burt Bacharach went round and round in my brain all day long. I had an 1100 foot climb, with a heavy pack due to refilling my food bag, but luck was with me. The AT passed thru a beautiful lake and city park on the edge of the city of Ft. Montgomery. City people wearing street shoes could hike on a brief portion of the AT. The powers that be decided that they would provide several signs along the trail describing what went into the making of a state of the art hiking trail. So I had the unheard of luxury of doing my 1100 foot climb on a state of the art hiking trail. No tangled roots and boulders for me! Nope, I strolled on a smooth as silk cinder path, ideal for a long leisurely jog. All ascents were done courtesy of smooth, individually cut steps! The cynical part of me wondered if the REAL AT was going to reappear just as soon as the tourist trail ended, and that's what happened, but by that time, I was almost to the top of my 1100 foot climb. I wear synthetic clothes that dry very quickly when they get wet. The WORST thing you can wear when hiking in the woods on a rainy day is cotton. It gets wet very easily, and STAYS wet, robbing the body of heat. My underwear was cotton, and I was fine as long as I was hiking, but when I got to the shelter at the end of the days hike, I began to shiver uncontrollably. Fortunately, I had dry underwear in a plastic bag, and as soon as I changed into my dry underwear, I was ok.","Fort Montgomery N Y Motel

The weather forecast says rain for some of today, and a 36 hour windstorm (steady winds of 40 M.P.H. all day long). Yesterday, on a very slick, wet, lichen covered rock, I took a very hard fall. It happened so quickly that I had no time to try to prevent the fall. Luck was with me, and I suffered not so much as a scratch! Today, with more rain, and wind gusts of 40 MPH, and my backpack acting like a wind sail, and very cold temperatures all day long I am going to take a rest day. I have one other motivation for taking a rest day today. In just a few days, my hike will be over, and I want to spend today reflecting on what I have experienced during the last 7 months. A few days ago, I was hiking with a young man who asked me if I had learned anything as a result of this hike. Prior to doing this hike, I read a book by Nimblewill Nomad (""Ten million Steps""). In that book he says he experienced a profound spiritual awakening during his 11 month hike. I wondered if the same thing might happen to me. While my thinking has changed in subtle ways, I have had no earth shattering spiritual awakenings. I have come to one probably important realization. That realization is that most people, myself included, need to learn to love and appreciate themselves much more. "" Be kind to yourself, so that you can be happy enough to be kind to the world."" I wish I could tell you that this very profound sentence in quotes came to me after a month of sitting semi-naked and cross legged under a banyon tree, subsisting for a month on bread and water, while chanting and meditating all day long, but the reality is a little bit different..... I found this sentence scrawled on a privy wall (I think the author might be Misha Collins). (WARNING; this blogger is about to climb on his soapbox) As I reflect on the most generous, giving, loving people I know, without exception, they are very gentle , loving, and forgiving of themselves. In many ways, I am my own worst enemy. When I screw up, I am very hard on myself. At times, I do something that is very, very smart and intelligent, and give myself very little credit for this, while beating myself up for mistakes that are often very small ( I think most people do this.) I am trying to learn to pat myself on the back for my successes, and to look upon my failures as learning experiences. I have come to believe that a person cannot love others and experience the many joys that life has to offer until he/she first learns to love himself/herself. Ok, I'm off my soapbox now. It was SOOO cold that day, that I lay inside my tent inside my sleeping bag, and all my friends took off to hike, so it was a very long boring day for me, but I was rewarded with yet another great spiritual truth: On a very cold day, it is better to hike than to be very bored and cold while huddling inside your tent and sleeping bag all day! The wind was REALLY whipping thru the trees, and all day long I kept wondering if one of those trees was going to come down on my head.

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550999,"Often, there are signs along the AT saying it is illegal to camp near water sources. I obey these signs, and if I am going to stealth camp, I camp WELL beyond these bodies of water. Hikers are often asked what their favorite state was on the AT. My clear winner here is Maine. Its overwhelming beauty, coupled with the deep silence and peacefulness of its forests and lakes make this an easy choice. I also have a LEAST favorite AT state. Once again, it is NO contest. My least favorite state, ( by a LANDSLIDE) is... ( drum roll please) New York. There are several reasons for this. 1) Hitchhiking is illegal in New York, and hitching a ride to a nearby town to resupply food is nearly impossible. 2) When you finally get to a store, the food available for resupply is very limited and of poor quality. New York is famous for its delis, and I always pick up sandwiches for 3 meals. I can't buy more than 1 days worth of sandwiches because I don't have refrigeration, and the other food is very limited, and of very poor quality. I used to moan and groan about eating Knorrs for dinner every nite, but in NY, I was reduced to eating a dinner of boiled pasta shells for 3 nites, because that's all they had on their meager shelves. Napoleon once said that an army marches on its stomach, and I think the same can be said for hikers. When you have spent a grueling day, hiking over New York's endless boulders, and harrowing climbs/descents, it is very demoralizing to have nothing for dinner except boiled pasta shells (without tomato sauce.) In retrospect, New York is the only state where I would advise future hikers to mail food to themselves at post offices. 3) Water is very scarce in New York. (It was also very scarce in Massachusetts and Connecticut. If it weren't for Trail Angels who dropped off gallons of water at road crossings, I and other hikers wouldn't have made it)4) New York is one of the toughest states in terms of rocks/ huge boulders on the AT, and INSANELY steep ascents and descents. My impression is that they made the trail as tough as they could by deliberate design. A trail is NOT enjoyable when one false step, (or a slip due to a rainy or windy day) could result in serious injury or even death.

My trail name is Marshmellow. I gave myself that trail name. here is the (long) story behind my trail name. Many years ago, a psychologist did a very famous experiment involving young children. He called these young children into his office, and had a pleasant chat with them. He then told the children that he had to go back to his office to do some work, but that he would return to chat some more with the children in 20 minutes. While he was gone, the children could play with the childrens' toys in the other room. There was also a single marshmellow on a plate. The children were told they could eat that marshmellow at any time, but if they waited until the psychologist returned to talk with them again, he would offer them a second marshmellow. The psychologist then noted which children opted for one marshmellow, and which children delayed their gratification until they could have a second marshmellow. He looked these children up 25-30 years later and found that as a rule, the children who waited for the second marshmellow had accomplished far more in their lives than the children who opted for one marshmellow. I find myself in a similar situation on my AT hike. Only one in four people who start the AT complete the hike. If I quit the hike, I can have good food to eat, a shower any time I want, and I don't have to lug a heavy back pack up and down mountains and over rocks and roots. I get one marshmellow.

marshmellow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551002,"Today is October 26. This will be my last entry to this blog, as I complete my hike today. I have had two great fears as I hiked the AT . My first fear was that I might contract Lyme Disease, a chronic very serious life long health problem caused by getting bitten by a deer tick. These ticks are the size of a poppy seed, so they are very hard to see or feel if they get on you. I remember the first tick I saw while hiking the AT. It was on my tent, and it filled me with a very deep sense of fear and dread. I was able to deal with this threat by wearing long pants and spraying my clothes with a very effective tick repellent called Permethrin. My second greatest fear was getting lost in the woods. This fear only became severe for me in the last few days of my hike. The AT is marked by white paint rectangular (two inches by six inches) markings on rocks and trees. These white rectangular paint markings are called blazes. Ideally, you should be able to see from one blaze to the next one. However, blazes fade over time, marked trees blow over, and sometimes it is not possible to see from one blaze to the next one. Thousands of people have walked the AT over many decades, so usually the trail is well defined. It is now late fall. As a result of the 36 hour windstorm, many leaves have fallen, hiding the trail, so in a few parts of the AT, there are no trail markings in view, and leaves have hidden the trail, and the trail often makes sudden turns. At such times, I am filled with a terrible panic. If I were hiking with one or more other people, this would be no problem. One person would simply stay put, where the last blaze was, while one or more other hikers would search out the next blaze. However, there are very few people left out on the AT this late in the fall (with the exception of weekends when there are many day hikers out), I might only see 1-2 other hikers (or none at all) during the course of a day. When both the trail and blazes disappear, I make my best guess as to where the trail goes to next, but there is always the risk that I will be wrong and then unable to find my way back to the last visible blaze. A few years ago, a hiker named Inchworm wandered off the trail and died, so every time I don't know where the next AT blaze is, and I am all alone in a silent, gray sky, cold, windy forest, I was filled with a terrible dread. I only had this terrible dread during the last few days of my hike. Happily, my story has a happy ending. I have finished my hike, and I am back at home in Miami. The last thing I want to do is thank the many people who have made my hike possible. The person who made the biggest sacrifice was my wife, Ginny. It was very tough for her to not see me for over 7 months. Ginny also mailed me stuff when I needed it, and kept the house going while I was gone. I also owe a very deep thanks to my sister Anne and her partner, Debra. They sent me very generous amounts of money, and treats, letters, and even lottery tickets during my trip. Anne and Debra, I cannot thank you enough. I want to thank my two Odyssey 2000 cycling friends, Randal and Ron who invited me to stay in their homes during my hike. I also want to thank all of the friends who visited me during my hike: Bob, Fred, Joe, Susan John, Sandra, and Karen and Dave who hosted me at their house. Also, thank you Beth for the wonderful care package you sent me. Thanks also to Warren Doyle, and all of the other WONDERFUL people I hiked with on Warren's New Hampshire/Maine hike. Finally, I want to thank the many, many trail angels who provided food and maintained the AT by donating their time to clear debris from the trail.
