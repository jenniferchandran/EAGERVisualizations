SIMPLE MAN,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543875,"Hiked through Norwich VT into Hanover,NH today.At the 1747 mile mark.442 miles to Katahdin.Vermont was beautiful starting with Glastonbury Mt through the Stratton Pond area.Beautiful sunset on the pond.The next morning watched a beaver swimming across it.I then met my daughter Julie and her boyfriend Steve,who hiked with me a couple of days.It was great seeing her.It was sad when she left.I miss being around my family.I stayed at the Green Mountain House in Manchester The owner Jeff was great host.Real bargain at 35 bucks.Bromley Mt was really nice with great views from atop a ski lift area.There was a old school desk at the top that I sat in.Funny picture.The trail then led to the Lost Rock Pond Shelter.On the way was a big rock climb that had great views,then got caught in wicked thunder storm with hail stones bouncing off my head.Trees falling was my biggest worry making my way up the water logged trail.I was still wet the next day.A twenty mile day that included a amazing stop at Qu's Whistle Stop ,breakfast ,lunch,ice cream and ride back to trail.Hiked to Gov.Clements shelter,next morning hiked up Killington with ET.We had summit to ourselves.Really cool with outstanding 360 views.Then it was on to Rutland and a stay at the Yellow Deli.Interesting place with a interesting take on life.It was a good stay and resupplied at a Price Shopper across the way.Also had a beer and watched the Red Sox at the Center Alley across the street.The next three days hike included stop at the Lookout,a privately owned cabin with a lookout perch on the roof for cool views,that they leave open for hikers.Trail magic was abundant on this leg of the journey.A cooler full of goodies and water at Cloudland Rd.A cooler with bottles of water at another site.A woman who cooks dinners and breakfast for hikers in West Hartford.Amazing.Thankyou all.Vermont wss definitely my favorite state so far.Really looking forward to the challenge ahead,the Whites,Presidentials in New Hampshire and then Maine.442 tough

SIMPLE MAN,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545348,"Wow,made it through New Hampshire,298 miles to go.The Whites were tough hiking,amazing,spectacular.Words can't begin to describe the ruggedness or the scenic beauty.From the tough hikes up and down Mt.Moosalauke and the Kinsman to Franconia Notch and the Presidentials and then Wildcat and The Carter Range,it was just phenomenal.Favorite part of the AT so far hands down.Couldn't take enough pictures.I think the Beaver Brook trail coming down Mt. Moosalauke in the rain and going down Mt Garfield at end of Franconia Ridge were the toughest going.Being on top of Mt.Washington with a steady wind of 38mph and gusting to 65 mph with clouds racing by was an amazing sensation.I had the opportunity to do work for stay at two of the huts run by the Applachian Mountain Club.I washed dishes at Mitzpah Hut,which is just below Mt.Pierce on the way to Lake of the Clouds Hut below Mt.Washington,where I took a break.Then over Mt.Washington,Jefferson and Adams to Madison Hut,at the foot of Mt Madison,where I washed dishes again with a few other hikers.In exchange for work you get the kitchen leftovers plus a dry place to sleep,and a whole lot of fun socializing with guests and crew.Great experience.I think one of my favorite moments of the week came when hiking from Mitzpah Hut to Lake of the Clouds I came across a family stopped on the trail and letting some Canadian GrayJays neeble some crackers out of their hands.They allowed me to take part and took pictures.It reminded me of the ""Pet Detective"" movie.Anyway then Climbing over Madison on a real windy morning and down into Pinkam Notch was a workout.Stayed at the AMC and feasted then it was time for the Wildcats and Carters.A series of peaks and a steep notch hike that took me two days.I camped at the Imp Campsite about 12 miles in and took pictures of nice sunset.Next morning hiked over Mt.Moriah and into Gorham where I'm taking a zero at the ""Barn"" hostel before heading into Maine.P.S. I texted Pinky this morning.You all remember Pinky from me hiking with him and his dog Levi in Virginia and PA.He's up in Rangley ME. now about 7 or 8 days ahead of me.","Hanover,NH

SIMPLE MAN,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546296,"Maine,the last state in this AT journey.Tonight I'm in the town of Rangeley,on beautiful Rangeley Lake.It's the halfway point between the Equator and the North Pole.220.4 miles south of Katahdin,the AT's northern end.From Gorham NH the trail gets really wet,muddy ,rocky and rooty as it leads to the NH/ME border.Crossing the border into the Mahoosic Notch,the so called toughest mile on the AT.Took me about hour and 15 minutes to jump from boulder to boulder,crawl under and through small crevasses,and figure out this rock rubics cube.Basically once in the notch your on your own to figure the best way through it.Upon reaching the Northern end,a steep climb up awaited me.Then it was on to Grafton Notch where I got a shuttle into the Pine Ellis hostel in Andover for the night.A nice friendly place in a nice small town.The next day hiked up the Baldpates where a combination of slabrock,rain and high winds made going really tough.Spent lot of time on my but getting down off this rockpile.Then for reasons I,m still not sure of I decided to do a eighteen mile day over Old Blue and Bemis mountains,the latter seemed to take forever,to the Bemis shelter.It was dark when I arrived.Cooked and ate by headlamp.Glad there was still room in shelter.Didn't feel like finding a tent spot.After Bemis and a stop at Sabbath Day pond beach,waded out up to waist,cold but nice,
I hiked down to SwiftRiver campsite that set me up with a five mile hike to Rangley this morning to the Farmhouse Inn.On the way there was a really cool stop and view,with a sitting bench,on ME 17 overlooking Lake Mooselookmaguntic.One of my favorite spots.The Farmhouse Inn was really nice with a big kitchen for hikers.I bought spaghetti and broccoli and a tuna steak at the market 1/2 mile down the road.Shared the spaghetti with 4 other hikers.Then went into town and had a huge burger and salad at Parkside Resturant overlooking Rangley Lake.The next couple of days hiking took us over Saddleback,The Horn , Spaulding,and Sugarloaf mountains.
The later having a real tough decent to campsite.Earlier in the day we had to ford river,that was swollen from rain that night,leaving my feet cold and wet all day.The campsite was otherside of river so we had to ford that one too.No problem.Today we had a easy eight miles over South and North Crocker Mtns.and down into Stratton ME.Tonight staying at the Stratton Motel and resupplying.Tommorrow we climb the Bigelows.We passed the 2000 mile mark today,188 miles to go.NO MOOSE yet!??
