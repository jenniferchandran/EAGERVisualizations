Fifteen (formerly Ramblin Rex),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512082,"Well REI has their Labor Day sale going and two items I just had to have featured in the circular. In 2013 when I set out from Springer I had an Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2, which I still have. The only problem I had on the entire 2185 miles was the fly leaked at the three way cross over seam at the top and basically dripped right on my face. I call Big Agnes and they sent me one directly to the next hostel up the trail...free. However, on a recent backpack in the Sawtooths one of the two zippers for the entrance broke. The other still works but if it separated I would be up the creek. Since I don't want to chance that on next years thru-hike I took advantage of the sale with the $80+ savings for the tent. I was on my fourth pair of shoes when I finished he hike. My favorites were the Vasque Breeze. It comes in a fifteen and my local store had it in fifteen, 25% off, I bought those too. Oh, FYI, it may or may not be evident but my trail name is Fifteen. Name given to me by Bearcat early on in Georgia...it stuck. Only 8 1/2 months to go. Looking forward to meeting many hikers on the trail.","Home

Fifteen (formerly Ramblin Rex),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525482,"Well my late April start date will be pushed forward for 12 months to 2017. Last Friday I totaled my motorcycle, unfortunately I was on it at the time. I now have a long plate attached with metal screws on the front of my pelvis and a 'honkin' long screw on the rear of my pelvis. I am told that it will range from 2 months to 12 before I will be able to use complete weight bearing on my left leg. Although I have been here only a little over a week, the doctors and therapist are telling me I am doing great in the process.Oh, and about the totaled motorcycle, I have a spare one of them in the garage too. I don't plan on even attempting to ride again until after the hike though.I'll update in a week of so.Fifteen....class of 13 and 14.","Home

Fifteen (formerly Ramblin Rex),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531524,"I've been out of the hospital for about a month and had my first follow-up doctors appointment 2 days ago. I was hoping he would let me put some weight on my left leg. He said the normal length of time for someone with my type of injury is 3 months of nothing other than toe touch. However, with the xray results he said I would probably start some weight baring in after two from injury which will be in a couple of weeks. He also saw no reason that if I continue healing at my present rate and with diligent therapy I couldn't be back on the trail next year. That is my plan. I'll attempt to put the 'funky' x-ray in the journal later.Good luck to all of you this year....stay on your feet!!!I'll be there with you 2017er's.","Home from hospital....next week

Fifteen (formerly Ramblin Rex),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548465,"Just thought I would do an update. My last entry was a few months back. I will definitely be back on the trail near the end of April 2017. I will do a flip flop starting in Virginia, probably Daleville headed north.My recovery from the motorcycle accident is way ahead of schedule. I was originally told it may be six months or more before I walked again. I was walking in less than three and did a full pack three day backpack in the Sawtooth's a couple weeks back. I am no where near a hundred percent but am far enough along that I fully intend to start as planned in April. Looking forward to meeting many of the 2017 class.
