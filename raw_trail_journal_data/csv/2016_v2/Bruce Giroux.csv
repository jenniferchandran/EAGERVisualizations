Bruce Giroux,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484019,I've been breaking in my hiking boots since January and they feel great. The pack I ordered from ULA came in yesterday and was able to take it on a long walk this morning. It's amazes me how much room is in the Catalyst considering it only weighs 3 lbs. I plan to trim a couple of ounces off by removing the hydration sleeve and hand loops.,,View Entry,"Mar 05, Thu",0
Bruce Giroux,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484021,Only two weeks left before heading to Dahlonega for a nights rest and hardy breakfast before starting the AT on Friday March 27. Today I made arrangements with the great people at the Hiker Hostel to pick me up at the North Springs MARTA Station on Thursday the 26th of March. I'm both anxious and excited about hiking the AT. I've been planning this hike in my mind for a number of years.,,View Entry,"Mar 12, Thu",0
