This Year,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503467,"It's 3:30am and I couldn't sleep, which is very unusual. Yesterday, I repacked my pack for the __th time, and still look for ways to drop weight (""get over it, John!"" Today, we head for Kalamazoo, and our niece Emily's wedding (to Zack). Prior to that, I have my Grape Nuts cereal to bag (with dried blueberries and powdered milk). Now that I am ""Past Rotary Club President"" all the pressure is off - just a few more details, then GO HIKE! Carolyn and I will head for Sharon, CT, on Monday, at least one overnight at Bearded Woods Hostel, then she will drop me off at Connecticut Rt. 7 (south of Great Barrington), then the adventure begins. Please wish me safe passage, and God speed! Think I'll now return to bed...","Gearing up for THIS YEAR

Fairly early tomorrow, Carolyn and I head out for Sharon, CT, and our good friend (Hudson and Big Lou) at Bearded Woods Hostel.

This Year,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542451,"Prior to our trip to Sweden, I was feeling A LOT of pressure to hurry the last segment of my quest to complete the remaining 330 miles (we will be visited by my ""German Brother"", Hans, from July 21-29. So, I needed to either complete my hike, or return to complete the remaining miles). In one my my few salient moments I decided to defer the start until August 23rd, when I would have the rest of August, all of September, and early October to savor the moments on the Trail that I am so looking forward to. So - My preparation consists of A LOT of road biking (I did a Rotary Club ride [aka MESA Ride, western Ohio, 330 miles in 6 days], and walking (with/without my backpack). The best part of all this will be the fact that I can enjoy summer at home, camping, time with family/friends, and NOT hurry. I will also be focusing on raising money for our family YMCA - for Youth Development, and raising scholarships for their day care program. During my '15 hike, we raised ~$1,400. So, my goal this time is $4,000. We shall see if that's realistic. Regardless and, through it all, I will be rested, ready and revitalized to GET THIS DONE. Besides, Carolyn convinced me to change my trail name from ""Next Year"" to ""This Year"". We BOTH want this DONE!!! God willing, it will be so!",,Preparation for the final 330 miles,"Jul 16, Sat",0
This Year,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545582,"My emotional load is a bit less today, as I have unloaded by backpack, making sure that all important elements are within its confines. With a bit more than a week to go before Andrew and I fly to Berlin, N.H., I find that I still need a few items (not in the order of importance - Prescription refills, some tuna packets, mayo packets, contact lenses, PB, Nutella, contact solution, gorp, Aleve, some tortilla flats, and perhaps some cheese and sausage. I have now packed 5 USPS boxes (for Carolyn to mail per my instructions) with my meals (etc.), and probably will do 1-2 more.On Monday, I will have the pleasure of speaking with the ""Silver Sneakers"" group (Vermilion YMCA), who hopefully will support our challenge to raise $3,000+ (we have already exceeded $500). If this group $300, by 8/22nd, someone gets to SHAVE MY HEAD! My barber (Eddie) will be present, just in case they don't. All continues to be going good, and my ""training"" continues to be fine, I feel very good. Less then 10 days to go before Andrew & I head for N.H., with 2 days of ""Slackpacking"" prior to heading into Maine ""alone"" - God willing!",,Preparation for the final 330 miles,"Aug 13, Sat",0
This Year,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546566,"It's 61 degrees on the shore of Lake Erie. I have packed, unpacked, re-packed my backpack tooooo many times to mention, much to Carolyn's distraction! But, not it's time for some action. Andrew and I will fly to Gorham, this morning, check-in to White Mountain Lodge & Hostel, will ""Slackpack"" two days, then off I go. I don't think that another day/two of ""preparation"" will help, as I just need to GO HIKE - then a LOT of my angst will vaporize. Yesterday, I had the delight of having my head shaved in the company of the Vermilion Y's Silver Sneakers class (along with several of the Y Youth Development classes - little kids' day care). Our $300 challenge worked to perfection, as we raised $469 for their youth development (scholarships). Our total goal has been increased to $3,000 (from $2K), which I now believe is very obtainable.Here we go...","Preparation for the final 330 miles
