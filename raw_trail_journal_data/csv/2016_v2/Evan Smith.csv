Evan Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521837,"https://eddyandsummit.wordpress.com/2016/02/25/return-to-locust-fork/Ben and I stood on a rock outcropping on river right, looking slightly back upstream at Powell Falls. The last time I had run the Locust Fork seven years ago was my first time in a whitewater boat. That had been a nice, warm, and sunny spring day. Today was very different—rain had been falling off and on the whole day and the temperatures were around 50 degrees.My stomach churned as I watched the frothy green water bouncing off rocks on its way down the falls before joining back with the other fork of the river and continuing downstream. The water level was around 1,000 CFS and rising.Ben pointed out the line I needed to follow in order to have a clean run down the rapid. “See that trail of white water stemming from the log in the water there?” he asked, pointing to a tree which had fallen into the river. Together with a tree on the bank this log made a right triangle, with the river as its base. “You want to follow that as closely as possible. Get over to the right of it even. But not too far right or you’ll be in those rocks!”I decided I wanted to run the rapid in my Jackson Karma, instead of the Dagger GForce I had been using up until that point on the river. I was still rebuilding my confidence after I had been soundly thrashed on the Kaituna River in New Zealand in January, and the Karma is certainly a confidence inspiring boat. We hauled my Dagger up on the rock we were scouting from and Ben stood there with my throw rope while I walked back upstream to where we left the Karma on the bank.As I carefully negotiated the mud and rocks my thoughts began to drift back to the things I had been contemplating on my drive over to Hayden, Alabama this morning. I had quit my corporate job the week before, and had no clue where life would take me next. I worried about car and health insurance, retirement, having a family in the future, and so on and so forth. As I got to the boat, I shook all of that out of my head and focused on hitting the rapid in the right spot. I ferried upstream and glanced back at Ben’s position on the rock before peeling out and paddling towards the falls. I ran about 5 yards left of the fallen tree, dropped, and the white spray hit me in the face and blinded me. I braced on the right before hitting a rock on my right side, propelling me up, forward, and over to my left. I found myself under the green water, but quickly rolled up, laughing before I even cleared the surface.I ferried back to the right bank and Ben helped me carry the boat back to the shore. “You went too far left!” he said. Ben is not a very experienced whitewater kayaker, but he grew up 15 minutes from this river and had paddled the falls countless times. After college he took some roll classes and learned the basics of whitewater as well.“Yeah, I guess you could even go under that log and run slightly to the right of it, huh?” I replied as we examined the rapid together. I stayed on the rock with the throw bag while Ben went to launch the Karma. I gave him the thumbs up as he peeled out and headed my way.“Going under the log, eh?” I thought as Ben approached the rapid. At the last second, Ben decided he didn’t want to go under the log after all and tried to change his trajectory. The river insisted otherwise, and I watched Ben touch the log first with his bow, and then the right side of his boat. He stayed there upright for a moment before the flowing water on the left side of his boat pushed the kayak over and his head disappeared from view.I ran back up the shore with the rope at the ready. I got closer and still couldn’t see Ben, but I watched my paddle go floating over the falls. As I got to around 10 yards downstream of his position, I saw Ben’s wide-eyed face emerge from the water. I threw him the rope and he caught hold, which helped swing him to river right instead of downstream. Behind him I saw my boat come free and begin to drift towards the falls. It was a foot or two behind Ben, so I yelled at him to grab the front of the boat. He let go of the rope and tried for the boat with both hands before realizing his mistake. Fortunately he had made it to shallower, slow moving water and was able to stand up and join me in watching my boat go over the falls and carry on downstream. I waited to make sure Ben made it to shore before running to my Dagger playboat and beginning the pursuit of my runaway gear.I popped on the skirt and tried to peel out into the main flow of the river, but ended up hitting a rock and flipping instantly. I rolled without thinking about it, and paddled hard through the class 2 boogie water—my gaze fixed on the bobbing green and blue tye dye Karma.As I chased the large boat, I kept looking at the trees on the flooded banks on either side of the river, hoping to see my fiberglass paddle lodged in between them. Then, as the boat went through a wave train I saw the bright red paddles rise on the next wave beyond the kayak. I corralled the boat and paddle to the shore and pulled both kayaks up on large rock laying at an angle in the water on the right bank. As I drained the boat I watched Ben navigate the rock and briar covered shoreline as he slowly made his way the quarter of a mile down river.The whole time I sat there I couldn’t stop laughing with relief that not only had Ben not been more seriously pinned but I didn’t even lose any gear! After draining the boat, Ben and I paddled on before hiking up a creek to look at a 15 foot waterfall which drained into a large, deep pool.As we paddled through the last few stretches of whitewater before the take out, I didn’t think about those things that were stressing me again. I was in awe of the beauty of the river. Large boulders and low hanging fog surrounded us and waterfalls cascaded down rock faces to join the river at every turn. It was a wonderful day in February to be on the river that first introduced me to kayaking in whitewater. It took many more years for me to rediscover it, but I am glad that I have. Fast water and nature can be a great cure for many ailments. I had a great first day of unemployment.Soon, I go north!","Alabama

Evan Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523240,"Michael and I drove from Atlanta and met my friend Ben and his parents at Amicalola falls. I registered as thru hiker 390 and my pack with food and water weighed in at 23.5 pounds. Not too bad. We said goodbye to Ben's parents and started up the stairs. My brother Michael would join us for the hike to springer and camp the first night before hiking back south to springer and his car. The approach trail was tougher than I remembered! But before long we reached the first white blaze. There was a small crowd of spring breakers smoking cigars around the plaque. The night on springer was cold and windy, and rain fell and froze on our tents.","Amicalola Falls

Evan Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523241,I the morning Michael hiked south and Ben and I hiked to gooch mountain shelter. We stopped early in the day and claimed spots in the shelter. A nice night spent around the fire was followed by a warm night in the shelter.,"Springer Mountain Shelter

Evan Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523242,"Ben and I hit the trail around 6:40, shooting for a 9 mile day to lance creek. We got to camp at 10am and started a fire. Before too long, many of our new friends from gooch mtn came to join us. We all visited all day. The fire burned until 9pm.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Evan Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523243,"Ben and I got an early start out of lance creek and climbed blood mountain. This was my 3rd time hiking this section of trail and was my nicest climb yet. Blue skies and warm weather made for great views. We took in the view from the summit before heading down to neels gap. Ben and I each ate a pizza and then got a cabin with some of our new friends: cricket, cold oats, and Zoe. We had a nice day relaxing I. The cabin and visited with some other hikers from Mississippi and indiana. Even though we had been on trail a short time it was nice to have a shower and do laundry. Eating was even better. I had another half a pizza for dinner, a Danish, a banana, some breakfast bars, and some ice cream.","Lance Creek

Evan Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523244,The next morning it was foggy out but warm. I had some avocado and a chicken biscuit and half a banana for breakfast. We left neels gap around 10:30 and set out for low gap shelter. Ben and I ran into our crew at cow rock and kept on. Trail magic at hogpen gap consisted of Oreos nutter butters and water. After some easy trail we came to the shelter and claimed spots inside. There must have been 20+ hikers here and we had a great time around the fire. I soaked my feet in the creek and made twig kayaks which I threw into gnarly miniature hydraulics and watched them get recirculated. I have had to fight off the feeling that I am not pushing myself hard enough. We have been getting to camp with enough daylight that we could do plenty more miles. I have ft some knee pain as well as on the bottoms of my feet. No blisters yet. I know holding back is the right thing to do for now but I am excited to start putting more miles behind me. I am so lucky and excited to be back on the trail.,"Neels gap

Evan Smith,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524521,"Yesterday we awoke in the long branch shelter after climbing standing Indian and Albert mountains the day before. Standing Indian had been shrouded in clouds but occasionally we glimpsed a view from a rocky outcrop near the summit. It was like looking through a swirling telescope of mist. The trail was of an easy grade and we soon climbed Albert mtn. This is the first place on the trail where one must use the hands in order to ascend the steep terrain which the trail traverses. It was a fun climb and I was in a mood where I wanted to climb quickly. It is great to once again feel so energized and strong. My trail legs are coming back. We arrived at long branch just after it began to rain. Thunder rolled overhead and I was happy to see the shelter was not overly packed. Inside I found teach, jaime, Sherpa crow, P Stout, Ben , Sparks, Napster, and Zoe. The shelter was a large timber frame structure and looked and smelled great. The next day we hiked out, Ben P Stout and I aiming to get into town to resupply and meet our crew on silers bald to camp that night. I hiked quickly to rock gap where I saw a young thru hiker carrying a garbage bag full of food towards the trash cans. In his right hand he held a stack of 5-6 pieces of white bread. In his left he held a huge finished branch of walnut. For this reason he is called walnut. He put down his bag to open the bear proof garbage can and took one last massive bite of his bread sandwich before throwing it and the bag in can with a regretful look. I took some dehydrated hash browns out of the bag and sparks got a rice meal. I hiked with green hornet to winding stair gap. Once Ben and P stout got there I put out my thumb. Third passing vehicle picked us up and after some pleasant conversation we were dropped off near restaurants. I had half a fried chicken with corn mashed potatoes and black eyed peas at the normandie cafe. Mid way through my meal I get a text from shepherd (13). Next thing I know I hear "" Hey hiker trash!"" Sheoherd is in town and gives us a ride everywhere we need to go. I get new shoes and an inflatable sleeping pad from outdoor 76 and then we hit the road. We climb the few miles up to silers bald shelter at a 4mph pace and get water before continuing up a strenuous old logging road to silers bald. There we cooked hot dogs over an open fire and watched the most beautiful sunset. Zoe and I opted to cowboy camp and were awoken in the night by strong winds. In the morning I awoke to the pitter patter of rain on my sleeping bag. It didn't last long and I stayed dry, but there was no view in the morning due to dense fog. The theme of the trail this year is hiker feeds/trail Magic. Coming up to wayah bald today I was treated to 2 cheeseburgers a beer and assorted drinks and snacks. This was the 6th time Ben and I had encountered ""magic"" on the trail. Ben got the trail name Tortilla after he asked Sparks, Zoë, and I for a tortilla at Wesser bald. None of us had one, but Ben spotted a tortilla hanging in a tree and shook it down to make a tuna tortilla for lunch. Sherpa crow later made up a hilarious story about how the tortilla got in the tree which involved an unknown hiker using it as a sweat rag and frisbee ing it off the observation tower. The NOC was a nice break and I visited with Ben's family and Zoë's friends before hiking up to Sassafras Gap. That night was the coldest yet. I sat on a ledge at the Jump Up and practiced ""breath of fire"" as hail began to fall. As we slept in the shelter that night several inches of snow accumulated. The hike up Cheoah Bald was beautiful in the snow and we were rewarded with a beautiful view of the sun shining onto the valley below and mountain range beyond. That day I hiked through snow to cable gap shelter. Tortilla Zoë and I had the shelter to ourselves and there was already a bed of hot coals in the fire place. We got a nice fire going quickly and stayed up late watching the nearly full moon bathe the forest in bright light, casting long shadows in the trees The next morning we hiked the 6 miles to Fontana where we got some good food and a clean room. Noro virus has scared us away from the shelter. Tomorrow we enter the smokies.","Cable Gap Shelter
