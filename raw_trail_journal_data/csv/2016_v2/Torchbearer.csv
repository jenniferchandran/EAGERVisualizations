Torchbearer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534676,"Have been prepping for planned hike in NC, sections 7-11. Still planning gear for this summer hike. Wondering if my prep work, including physical conditioning, will be enough. ??",,View Entry,"May 23, Mon",0
Torchbearer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534726,"Read this book recently. Told my friends it either made me want to walk out the entire trail or sit at home out of the dangers one might experience. The writer shares his personal and spiritual journey in a real and telling use of words through stories along the journey. I learned some trail lingo, which sections might cause most difficulty, and how what you bring to the trail (not just gear but life experience) guides your trip. I'm planning for as many section hikes as God will allow and if He takes me on a thru-hike I'll depend on Him to make it happen.",,View Entry,"May 24, Tue",0
Torchbearer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534993,"Deciding what to purchase now for a week of section hiking is not easy. I want to make purchases that are ""best"".Best for a short hike. Best for a longer hike. Best for all seasons. Best for future hikes I know nothing about. Best for keeping me comfortable. Best for supplying me adequate energy. Best for keeping me safe. Best for an enjoyable and memorable hike. What is best? Mmmmmm....",,View Entry,"May 25, Wed",0
Torchbearer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535310,Part of the excitement of being outdoors is hanging from the trees. Enjoying the breeze of my trial hammock run today. Won't be long and this will be my oasis from the up and down footpath. Will need more practice with all my gear but especially setting the Hennessy up for a comfortable night!,,View Entry,"May 27, Fri",0
Torchbearer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537044,"Today's prep took place on an island. TS Collin is bringing tropical weather to what was supposed to be a relaxing weekend. Instead there has been indoor gear hunting which always turns into an even longer wish list. Then today I did some physical prep on the beach (slow burbees and unsteady planking) in the rain. Next, weather permitting, a few hours test hike up Cherokee Trail (up and down a couple of times) on Stone Mountain later in the week. I think we are at a 7 week countdown.",,View Entry,"Jun 06, Mon",0
Torchbearer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537532,"Today was a day I really tested my body and resilience. Stone Mountain in GA is a tough little hike. I don't think it would have been half as bad if it were not all rock...but then it would not be Stone Mountain. Learned a few things: 25 lbs is all I want to carry for the week. Adjusting pack straps doesn't last long before I'm ready to adjust again. My pack needs to fit correctly or I'm not going to enjoy this hike. (I had a small heart episode a few years ago so I'm always questioning chest pain) Going up at a 45 degree angle causes my chest to hurt. My boots felt good. Trekking poles seemed to increase the pack pressure on my shoulders. Need to figure out adjustments for pack and poles so I'm not countering my adjustments. Lastly, felt a small sense of accomplishment but now have a small amount of fear that the AT hike will be more than I was planning. Time to get focused!",,View Entry,"Jun 09, Thu",0
Torchbearer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541002,"We are less than 3 weeks away from our first section hike. While I have titled this to contain information about food and gear, my body has been doing a lot of prepping too. Every day I have been attempting to work out a couple of hours each day, most of the time that means 4 to 6 mile hikes with my gear. Not sure in the flatlands where I live if any of this will really help me, but I assume any strengthening won't hurt. Food prep is almost complete. I consulted a nutritionist friend of mine to ensure that my protein, carbs, and fat numbers were in the green. I will be eating 2500 to 2800 cal a day and have a pretty balanced menu although it will repeat most days. As far as gear, I am still waiting on a few things I have ordered from Amazon to come in. I really wanted to keep my back pack and gear wait to under 30 pounds but I am creeping very close to that now without all of my stuff packed. I will do what I have seen many other hikers describe as a pick through, laying out everything and weeding out the things that are really not necessary (I hope I have some of that). I hope that will bring it down to a reasonable weight. Next prepping will be about ensuring I'm comfortable with all setup and use of those things that will keep me alive and well...stove, shelter, and water filter. That's probably pretty important prepping, huh?!",,View Entry,"Jul 06, Wed",0
Torchbearer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542770,"I must say that I have never worked so hard to end up with so little. The goal of trying to lighten the load while keeping what I really need has certainly been a chore.  I just got through weighing my six days of food in the dry bag and it is 14 pounds by itself. Feel like I have reduced that particular need down to the bare essentials, but always wondering, "" Will I really eat this much ?"". A few other things I took out of course: any extra packaging, one of my tree savers, only taking one change of clothes along with a nighttime set for the cooler nights, broke my toothbrush, took out one lightweight jacket as I have a rain jacket, no mouthwash, and a few other nonessentials were removed.My goal was certainly to get my pack to no more than 30 pounds. I think I am pretty close now.We will start our section hike this Sunday. I have checked the weather and all looks promising for spotty rain and thunderstorms, but overall perfect hiking weather.  Northstar, Blaze, Road Runner, and myself are ready to take a journey together. We have a private    Facebook prep page that we will open up for those planning friend and family hikes. We are calling ourselves the GALS, each of us being guided by God first--April/Anna, Lisa, Stacey...  Looking forward to where our Guide will lead us ...on the trail and in our future !",,View Entry,"Jul 19, Tue",0
Torchbearer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543340,"If you expect to read how a final shake down lightened my pack drastically or how I found a way to not carry 38#s up and over several summits by utilizing a drone... You won't find it here... Instead I have a short spiritual-insight entry I wanted to add as part of my prepping that some may want to read and others may not. If you move on to the next entry, no problem, but if you read on below may you find a new way to lighten your load. . Pilgrims Progress is an all time favorite of mine! The journey of Christain as he seeks to find what is missing in his life is a journey each of us is on. Christain has a very heavy burden he carries on his back and shoulders, a pack of sin and dispair that weighs more than anyone wishes to carry. As he walks, meeting both those that encourage him or others that drag him further down, his weighted pack remains a burden he wishes to get rid of. As he approaches the foot of the cross he finds a place to finally lay his pack down... Where our burden is heavy Christ burden is light. Christain's journey does not end here...he must continue to the end...facing much difficulty and is challenged by others and circumstances to turn around and give up. But ever with him is his forever friend and companion who he met at the cross...Jesus! The end of his journey is celebratory as he enters his heavenly home. A prize that through great trials was not what he earned but yet what he received as a free gift for surrendering a burden that he could not carry. He is us. We have a chance to surrender all we can't handle, including our sin, to a loving King waiting to lighten our burden and support us on our journey. When we attempt to go it alone with the heavy load of life we will be pulled into pits, holes, and ditches we are unable to climb out of alone. It is only when we say, ""I can't do this alone, I'm no good without a savior, and I will depend on your mercy and grace to see me through to the end"" will we truly lighten our burdens to the point we carry only what we choose not to surrender. In the simplest of pictures I could paint: imagine you are looking up at Albert Mountain (which I will be in a few short days) and you are carrying all you brought in your 40# pack...the straps seem to tighten further and the weight seems unbearable ... But then you see someone approaching from above you, reaching down, offering to take your pack and everything in it so that you can climb free of the burden you carry. You have a choice: hold on to what you carry, holding on with pride to the things that you can't just walk away from, or instead you slide free from the straps on your shoulders and waist, offering everything that weighs you down to a sweet and precious friend who loves you enough to carry your burden for you, never asking you to take it back again. May your journey be made new with Him!",,View Entry,"Jul 22, Fri",0
Torchbearer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543580,"Got on the trail at 9 am. Very slow go as we tried to regulate to the altitude on that first climb. The slow-steady-approach worked best with frequent breaks to rest the heart. We finally got into a groove and enjoyed several lookouts. We were not too sure of our timing but after about 6.5 hours of pushing forward we made camp at 5:30 pm (I guess that means we had 2 hours worth of breaks). We met a couple who have been hiking the AT since the mid 50s (Queen and My-aunt-died-that-way""...sorry can't remember trail name of her man who tried to lighten our spirits with untrue-stories on the trail). They gave us great tips and shared stories about AT hikes and other super hikes they or he had been doing over the years. Later two recently graduated students from FL joined us and we're amazingly kind and respectful boys. We told them to please report to their moms we said ""Awesome job"" because they helped us hang our bear bags and fix hammocks while being extremely tired after not sleeping for the past 24 hrs. First night in the woods: loud! At 12:30 am the loudest massacre-sounding noise took place. I was later told it was a screech owl but it sounded more like a bear mauling. I have since looked for sound bites of wood-animals and have only found the sound of fighting foxes to be slightly similar to the horrid sound I heard. Other sounds of the night: coyotes, limbs falling, snoring, and such... Normal stuff!All in all: loved the first day! 
Our findings: We did not understand the time to find and hang bear bags; sleeping in the woods is not as easy in a hammock as in a camper; shelter conversations make for memorable moments;and I don't like hanging a hammock on an incline!","Tellico Gap

Torchbearer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543584,"A bird said ""Get Up"" about 6:15 so I did...Today we lost one of our four in our group. Blaze got up feeling nauseous and lightheaded. She attempted to pull herself together for most the morning but finally had to call it quits after lunch when she felt faint and found herself lying in the trail. She had all the symptoms of altitude sickness. My brother came and got her about halfway up road 69 to Wayah Bald. So miss her!The next leg of hike was tough. We needed to make up time from all the start-and-go of the morning. The climbs seemed never ending but we made Siler Shelter after a very steep decline (after we just had climbed so very high...felt as if we just destroyed all the work we had done). A Boy Scout group had set up camp in the meadow so we pitched our hammocks close to the water. After doing our best to rinse off, cook, and cover everything before a nice big rain...we called it a night and listened to rain most of it. In addition to the sound of rain, their was all kind of animal noises of creatures getting water in the night. Some certainly sounded louder than others but I could never see them so I suppose I will never know.My feet are in pretty poor shape after today. I'll try to get a better protective barrier for them on tomorrow as we attempt 11 miles to Long Branch. We underestimated the workout our feet would have to do to get us up and over these summitsGod is amazing! His world is beautiful! Blessed for this hard journey! 
Our findings: I hated to loose one of our buds to sickness; Wayah Bald is beautiful; found plenty of water today; and we are still carrying to much weight but go rid of just a bit with the pickup of our friend.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Torchbearer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544238,"To get out of the Siler Bald Shelter valley we hiked back up and found ourselves on the other end of the loop at a different location than where we came in. The NOBO and SOBO trails were right next to one another and while we knew we were supposed to be heading downhill it would have been nice to see an ""S"" somewhere to be certain. We had the next best thing: boy-scouts. The group that stayed at the shelter were leaving at the same time we were and pointed us to the trail they had arrived on the night before and headed on the NOBO trail to their next stop. I guess they cant earn a ""helping the directionally impaired"" badge, but we appreciated the assistance.Most of the first part of trail was downhill which did not help the already sore toes but we would soon find Winding Stair Gap which was certainly not downhill. We had already been advised not to stay at Rock Gap Shelter but to go onto Long Branch...I'm so happy we did. By far my favorite site-seeing afternoon was beyond Rock Gap to Long Branch. The laurel canopies and hardwoods with no undergrowth were absolutely gorgeous. Felt like an enchanted forest.We arrived at the shelter and would be the only ones to stay there. This being one of the newer shelters in a beautiful setting made for a nice night sleep. Wish we could have taken a zero day there, but we had to keep going...Our findings: No great bear-bag trees at Long Branch Shelter; great water source; beautiful area; mice there like to play basketball in the loft...","Siler Bald Shelter

Torchbearer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544241,"Today's challenge is the one I most looked forward to getting to and had a slight dread for: Albert Mountain. Once we arrived the northside was easy as expected, just a short climb up a slightly rocky path to the summit. The view from the ground was blocked by low clouds and mist. We had to climb the tower to catch the view over the trees. Absolutely Amazing!!!Now time to head down the rocks! I took the lead and went slow. The rocks were certainly not evenly spaced apart or set for easy foot stepping, so slow and easy was the best practice. We of course slipped some, slid on our buttes, and depended a little too heavily on our poles to steady us down. After a 30 minute decline (I meant slow and steady) we were at the bottom and had only one scrape to identify the dangers we had faced. The rocks did not end there. The path forward was rocky and narrow in spots. After what seemed like too long, our feet being very sore, we made it to camp at Carter Gap. There we found a group from Alabama - The Butts - a trail running group. The ladies were helpful to us beginners and shared wisdom and assisted in hanging our food bags as bear activity seemed to be evident to them with scat and scratch marks. The laurel trees provided a great place to hang our hammocks near the shelter. During our talk tonight we decided we would get off the trail a day earlier than we originally expected. Not only had we lost several miles on our second day due to our sick friend we also all had accumulated several blisters that were causing great discomfort. We new we could make it to the next pick-up gap at Deep Gap but doubted we could make the extra 16 miles to Dick's Creek (our original pick-up location). So decision made and a good night sleep ahead.The wind picked up in the night, never rained, but cooled down a bunch. We all were trying to stay warm and dry most of the night and got some sleep but not as much as we hoped for. Our findings: not much water between Albert and Carter Gap; rocks are slippery even when they look dry; knowing we are getting off the trail tomorrow is bittersweet; and excited to see what Standing Indian has for us.","Long Branch Shelter

Torchbearer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544243,"Our morning started off in the high 50s or low 60s. After dropping a little more weight by giving away some food and leaving items hanging in the shelter for others not as weighted down as we were, we headed toward our final mountain: Standing Indian.Absolutely the best weather day we had... none of them were bad but this one was just cool and breezy with a cloud cover that made for a pleasant last day.We spent most of the day reflecting on our experience, talking about what we had learned, and sharing what God had inspired in us this week. Such a cleansing time for each of us as we shed from the burdens we did not need to carry around any longer. Love these ladies and their willingness to be free!Made it to Standing Indian Shelter for lunch and ended up putting my jacket on for the first time all day. At 5434 feet the cold finally was sinking in.We realized we only had 2.5 miles left to the end and we went on. At Deep Gap we shed from our packs and waited only 5 minutes for our ride.My brother was gracious to allow us in the Jeep with how we smelled. We had a great laugh over smells and our feet (even though they were quite ugly and smelly) and an enjoyable ride off the trail.Our findings: our feet played a big part in cutting our trip; we feel accomplished as we complete our first section hike; we need a list of all the things we don't need next time; and I could not have experienced this adventure with better ladies!","Carter Gap Shelter
