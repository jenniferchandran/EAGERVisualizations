I have been sending the link to those who have asked about my progress and especially to everyone who has financially sponsored my trip (bought my stuff). I leave early tomorrow morning for Georgia with Handlebar, my Triple Crowner friend. I'm nervous, don't know how much Ill sleep and I still have a lot to do tonight. Oh well.

Handlebar oversaw my grocery shopping at Wal-Mart yesterday, so you can be sure I have everything I need. I slept like the dead last night and look forward to about 8 miles of trail on my first day. Should be starting from Springer Mountain before noon.","

Note that my gut is quite large in May. It's safe to expect it to decrease after backpacking 2200 miles.Only hiked 8 miles today. I am taking it easy in order to get into shape and be ready to knock it out starting in June.,"Springer Mtn

Patsquach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532383,"It rained all night. In the morning it hailed. I just kept rolling over and going back to sleep. I started hiking at noon today but wasn't worried as I only had 8 mikes to the next shelter area. It rained all day too. Very cold, but I just kept moving instead of piling on clothes. A lot more elevation gain today too. Slow going, but it keeps you warm. There were so many people at the shelter site I set up my tent (14 snoring people in a shelter is not cool). Thank god I have good gear. Even with all the rain I was warm. These past few days I've been sleeping in. It's part of getting away from the pre-hike festivities and building back up.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Patsquach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532384,"Sunny and cool day. It will soon be in the 80's so I'm grateful for cooler temps. I crossed a road today and there was a van there offering free shuttle rides to a local outfitter and hostel. I rode in for some odds and ends. Plenty of time for hiking and breaks today. I even sat atop Woody Gap on a nice hot rock with a view of over 20 miles. Camped near a creek today with most of the small herd I met the first night. Everyone is having a good time, and 7 of us plan to compete the entire trail. Some have already left due to blisters and not realizing what it's like backpacking here. Georgia is twice the scale of anything in PA. I've also met two GATC ridge runners who confirmed the Handlebar wisdom of starting off easy. We'll be covering 20 miles a day soon enough. My first major resupply looks like it will be about 80 miles in near what's called the Top of Georgia. There is a restaurant with a salad bar. Fresh vegetables are on my mind already. Spam and cheese is still rock solid for dinner though.","Gooch Shelter

Patsquach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532385,Climbed up Blood Mountain today. Had some cell service. No bears although they have been reported in the area. They may have simply had too many people camping there and leaving trash. Saw some guys on the way up with a drone. That would be cool. We came off the mountain and hit an outfitter at Neels Gap. Best chicken salad sandwich I've ever had. I didn't stick around too long lest I start buying pizzas so I climbed up to Bull Gap where the small tribe rendezvous for the evening.,"Lance Creek

We missed some rock that supposedly looks like a cow, but no big loss there. Went on a side trail for water and turned out adding a 3 mile round trip. That sucked. Good water, but there was another spring 0.2 miles further along the main trail. Long hot afternoon ended at a shelter area in a wet hollow. I won't do that again (bugs). Slept in a shelter for the first time. 3 people snoring is also a bit much. I left at first light the next AM.","Bull Gap

We decided to hitch into town and celebrate breaking 50 miles on the trail. Helen, GA is a tourist trap, but also a really good place for a nero. Cheese steaks and subs were eaten, a few beers drank, and I wound up getting a hotel room for about $15. Not a bad day.","Low Gap

Today was the hardest day yet. 13 miles, which isn't bad, but with over 3000 feet vertical gain. Reminded me of the Black Forest Trail back home. I'm being eaten by midges and gnats as I update this. Didn't set up tent and will sleep in shelter tonight. Screw that, I set up the tent and am out of the bugs! Tomorrow I hitch into a town for my first food resupply. Looking forward to changing the menu a bit. Also getting tips on stuff from other backpackers along the way. Will basically hike about 4 miles to the road, hitch or get a shuttle into town, then return to trail and hike in a couple miles to camp. I am going to get some fresh veg and destroy a salad in camp tomorrow night, even if I need to carry grocery bags up a mountain!!","Helen, GA

Patsquach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532759,"Today I hiked with ""All the Way"" McCrea to the next gap where we sauntered down to the Top of Georgia hostel. This is a nice place. I needed to get into town and buy groceries, but it was the same price to stay here with shower and breakfast included, rather than pay for just the town shuttle. Had a chance to do laundry, eat at a fried chicken buffet,buy groceries, buy fuel, update social media, etc. You know it's a hiker place when they sell individual Ziploc bags. Little John and MJ were already here so it was good to see them again. MJ has to fly out to return to work in Minnesota, but LJ is going all the way like me. The youngins left this AM and are about 6 miles ahead, so we'll probably all catch up in the next week. I'm feeling stronger but now my pack has 7 days food and is damn heavy. Trying to get a friend to mail my lighter sleeping bag so I have it before the Smokey Mountains next week. That will be rough and I will go as light as possible. I also found out today that Tron is at mile 861. Will be able to rest a day or two with his family, but man that's a long way away. Oh well. One step at a time.","Deep Gap

Patsquach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533042,"In order for Georgia to say goodbye she led us up a climb that never seemed to end. About an hour before the top of the ridge in NC, I also got dumped on by buckets of rain with hail and lightening thrown in for good measure. Folks who were already over the last ridge never got it. It was nice finishing the first state Northbound (nobo) on the AT. Unfortunately there was a lot of trash. That is inexcusable. There are volunteers who police it but they shouldn't have to. Anyway, the day almost ended at Muskrat Creek shelter with an extremely attractive college professor. Between her class, the other thru hikers, and section hikers the place was way beyond capacity.

Patsquach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533743,"slept 12 hours and didn't get going until 11 AM. Guess I needed it. I did want to catch up with some folks I've gotten to like but there are plenty of miles left for that. I began the day hiking down a ridge toward Albert Mtn. Albert includes an approx 500 foot gain in less than a quarter mile. Almost climbing on all fours. There is a fire tower at the top and the views were epic. I'll try to load the panoramic shots. At the base of the tower I met some guys backpacking with their dad and another friend. They all had bourbon and offered me some. The next 3 miles flowed by quite well. I cooked dinner later on and bagged it up hoping to catch the others ahead on trail before I settled in. I got to Winding Stair Gap just as it was getting dark. It took awhile but I was able to hitch a ride with a guy toward Franklin, NC to pick up beverage and snacks. Todd was going to pick up bouncy castles he had set up earlier in the day (parties) before returning past where I got picked up. So I had a chance to hang with Todd (aka Toad) and enjoyed good conversation about a lot of things before retiring to my campsite for the night. All together an awesome day.","South of Betty Creek

I missed all their shenanigans! They had a bag of cheeseburgers and a box of wine. Who wouldn't enjoy that? My original plan was to make the Nantahala Outdoor Center on Tuesday. The weather this Sunday was epic, so I caught up to LJ and we wound up 15 miles out from the NOC at Licklog Gap. Even though I hiked all day I was dreaming of food and wound up eating another dinner at midnight by a nice fire reading Travels with Charley (thanks Joy!).

When we leave, we'll be climbing out toward the Smokies with the same gain. Damn. I'm writing this after having gained the NOC, eaten good pizza, showered, had a beer and washed my clothes in the sink. We rented a trailer with cable and I'm Chillin with Walker Texas Ranger. If I had to walk up that mountain tomorrow I doubt I could. I'm not taking photos, but I lost a lot of skin on my heels. The opinion of the salesperson was off. I'll be trying to get my old size shoes from REI. I'm sure we'll work something out. Else I'll be upset and they'll still have my money. At least I made friends with the neighbors and was invited to a bonfire, but I'm about to turn in. Looking forward to eggs tomorrow. Hopefully I'll cook a batch of meatballs for the crew (or just me). This place is big enough for all 8 of us.","Licklog Gap

Had one last breakfast at the NOC then I figured out some mail drop locations. Folks have asked if they can help my hike and I could use all the food I can get. There have been some unexpected gear costs for broken and worn out stuff so I'm going to be watching the budget a bit closer. This is the first time I needed to estimate mileage and dates for arriving at towns with post offices. I dated my ETA with some flex. I hope to upload lists of items that I eat and use Friday to take the guesswork out of it. Back to hiking, I'm laying in a shelter with 4 others who climbed up 3000 feet from the NOC. We're all tired. My other friends left much earlier, but we'll likely regroup at Fontana Dam on Friday. That is the entrance to the Great Smokey Mountains National Park.","

I paid extra to make sure it was, but money does not always fix things. Long story short it had gotten lost and the post master drove it out to the resort after hours. In the meantime I had to cancel the order and send for new shoes that wouldn't reach me until after the Smokies. I am in the resort lobby entering this and wearing my new shoes. Will need to figure out how to settle up with REI and take care of the $280 worth of charges out there on my debot card.At least the AT shelter here is posh. There is a shower house with really hot water, good for laundry and smelling much better. My knee is swollen up pretty bad so I will be hanging around the resort today before entering the Smokies Sunday. Hope if shrinks a bit. Will ice it. In the meantime there is a Nissan Z rally here with hundreds of really cool cars. I don't have a cool car but I am the only one here walking around in a kilt. It's a conversation starter.","Cody Gap

Patsquach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535692,"I'm in the Smokies! We started shortly after 9 AM and climbed up over 3000 feet to the shelter where I am now. It's been quite a day. Came across a snake early on then I rounded a corner and saw the largest black bear (that I've come across). Luckily we had a small group together and were able to make the bear leave the trail. I had planned to use my phone for photos but it takes a while to get it out of the pack, turn it on, etc. Perhaps I'll pick up a small camera or borrow one if someone could include it in a mail drop. I'm thinking something slim that I can hang on my pack strap. Anyway, even though we had to climb a lot today the gradient wasn't too steep. The trail is in great shape and the woods are almost magical. I've never been here and now wonder why it took so long. The peaks are rolling and the next week will be mostly around 5000 feet above sea level. Nice cool nights. Good for sleeping. My permit gives me 8 days to finish this section but I think 5 will be enough. That will depend on my right knee. At least I have the new shoes and got rid of the ankle problem. I fell behind the people I was with before since I needed an extra day off. Now I am hiking with a Marine (Dreamchaser) and a cool guy from New Zealand (Kiwi Ben). Good times.","Fontana Dam

I'd need to make up time to get there by Saturday the 28the. I hiked about 8 miles today and knew I'd only cover 12 instead of 18. There was a bear attack here about a week ago and they closed off a shelter and limited access to another, for use at utmost need with an electric fence. So my planned 15 mile days must be 18 or now 12. Oh well. Not much to say today. Someone built a fire to burn garbage (not supposed to do that). I set up my tent in the wrong spot and got totally smoked out. I moved it, but can't see myself sitting around the fire right now. At least the hike was beautiful today.

Patsquach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535696,"Problem is food again. Adding days to the next resupply requires more than my reserve. Today was going to be 14.5 miles up and over the highest point on all of the AT, or split into a 7 and 11 mile pair to work in a town run. Kiwi Ben and I plan to hitch into Gatlinburg tomorrow after about 11 miles, taking time at Clingmans Dome (elevation 6643 ft). Shuttle costs add a ton to the grocery bill. There doesn't seem to be a hostel or campground so that sucks too. Once we get back to trail it is 3 miles uphill - so a flophouse hotel is in order to avoid hiking uphill at night. I'll also try couchsurfing, but won't expect much in small towns. The hiking today was easy (short). A guy named Frog has knee problems and is slowly working toward the next road out. We're in a national park known for mountain wilderness, so there ain't many roads. I'm approaching the point where 50% of all those who started have dropped out. Right now I'm just trying to adjust my earplugs so I don't kill the kid next to me who snores like a champ (in shelter tonight). I think I'll make it. Also, I just went out to relieve myself and saw two wild boar next to our shelter. You don't see that every day. There is a lot of sign down here, but I hadn't seen any yet. I'm on the upper sleeping platform about 5 feet off the ground. I warned the guys on the bottom level......Not sure I'd like being in my tent tonight.

From there 4 of us were to be picked up and driven to Gatlinburg for resupply and awesomeness of showers. Our driver was a bit confused and after a couple hours he finally showed up then overcharged us. I'll hitch next time. So, got to a super cheap motel and yes, total Jerry Springer but I loved it. Got to see how much a tourist trap Gatlinburg is. It's cool if that's your thing. I skipped the moonshine tasting lest I never buy food or get my laundry done.

Some folks have a hard time walking from the parking lot to the Dome. I remember feeling like that around 2004 before hurricane Ivan. I'm not a victim but a result of my choices, and I don't ever want to be that immobile again. Anyway, uneventful day with an afternoon nap at the shelter. Perhaps too much fun in Gatlinburg. But I'd do it again. Met an ATC ridge runner today. She was cool. She thru hiked in 2014 and now goes out 5 days a week for a 35 week season.

They customer service people are nice and swap stories but they may want to up their game. Anyway, I wanted to skip past the shelter where the giant bear has been hanging out. I heard voices here and decided to stop anyway. We wound up with 22 people in camp which is good. Safety in numbers. I did also get a chance to start out at 7 AM today.

We reported it to the rangers and moved on toward the hostel (ie cold beer). The awesome news was that Duracell found the passport and alerted the hostel.

Climbs up are good. Another 3000 feet elevator over 4 miles? Sure. Downhill still sucks. Basically climbed up and over a mountain to wind up in a mosquito infested holler. I have an awesome little tent, so I am tapping this out in a bug free setting. I was going to hike up the next ridge and tent in a better breeze but after I ate I was done. Goal is to sleep early, rise early, and knock some miles out tomorrow so I can get into Hot Springs early Wednesday. Legs are strong. Knee not too bad. Feet sore from expanding (need wider shoe?). I posted on FB yesterday that I lost 22 pounds in 24 days of hiking. It's actually 32 pounds. Yeah, I had packed on some weight over the past few years. It's certainly coming off now. I drink a lot of water with propel and vitamin C packs. Eat decently and am rarely hungry. That could not happen in an office setting.

Could have been much worse, since my butt got full of mud on the slide down. Yay. We'll see about that warranty too. A little rain, but it ended early and I am camped across the trail from the shelter area in a nice pine grove adjacent a stream. No snoring hikers tonight. I was too tired to stop and see who was camped at the shelter. Maybe in the AM once I've had coffee. I'm only 3.2 miles from Hot Springs so I'll easily link up with Connie and Tom.

Within a mile the thunder and lightning came in and it stormed pretty good for a half hour. Sheets of rain make it hard to see but being atop the mountain means the storm will move off to another valley soon. We still had 3 miles left when the second storm hit and were extremely pleased to arrive at a great shelter with fireplace. A couple seasoned hikers were there and had gathered wood before most of the rain started. We had a chance to dry off, have a good meal and share experiences before turning in for the evening. Even with the massive snoring it was by far my favorite shelter experience. Rip van Winkle recommend a good chafing cream and let me have his. That's important stuff in rainy weather.

The plan was to stop in for a pizza and continue on. Over the last 24 hours I have had some chaffing issues along with weird back pain and the usual leg stuff. Did I mention I have some kind of nerve problem in my right upper quad and hip? Yeah, I'm a rockin' picture of health. I figure my pack can't rest on my hips with my rainjacket on and my lower back pain is from the shift. After the 9 miles to the hostel I was plenty ready for ibuprofen and resting on a bunk. The house cat Shady and I are chilling and watching Total Recall with the other rained out hikers. Shady seems to have fallen in love with my down bag and is wrapped up in my silk liner.

Wound up atop Bald Mountain which wasn't called out as scenic in my guide but is epic. Ate some dinner while watching the sun go down with a great 360° view. It's cold up here which keeps the bugs down. Met Panda and Princess Peach on top and we sauntered down to the shelter where about 10 others ended the day. A good water source and nice soft grassy area for renting. There is a lot of talk about the hostel coming up in Erwin, TN so I'm looking forward to checking that out and seeing how many hikers are clustered there.A funny thing happened today when I took my pack off for a break and some water. I was ready to start moving again but when I looked at my pack a sudden revulsion came over me and I mentally thought ""Fuck you pack!"" Then walked away from it. That didn't hold since I need that pack more than it needs me. So I'm still carrying that thing. I heard somewhere that those thoughts can happen to all of us.","Hiker Paradise

Turns out there is a famous hostel right next to the trail that we're aimed for. As usual, the Rocky downhill sections were a pain to my feet but I doubt that can be avoided based on the shoes I am wearing. I might need something with a thicker sole by the time I hit PA, which is known for being a pile of rocks along the AT. The day ended with a spectacular finish. I roll up to the hostel and am greeted by the owner then told there is a dinner shuttle in 20 minutes. It's also 99¢ Taco Tuesday. Good news. Then I walk out back to the inner sanctum and there are 20 people I've met along the trail and with whom I'm catching up to in mileage. They were all happy to see me and offered me a beer. After a pile of tacos and some beers we invaded Wal-Mart for supplies then returned to the hostel. I've dissed Wal-Mart plenty of times, but now I look like one of the weirdos inside so what the Heck. The only problem today was knocking my toe on a landscaping timber in the dark in my shower shoes. Apart from that, an excellent day.","Bald Mtn Shelter

Ugly bruising. I already needed to heal up some chafing so an extra day or two is now in order. I've been hanging with Panda and I could easily make excuses to spend time wherever she is.

Panda is awesome and it was the best time in a Wal-Mart ive ever had. We bought a ton of vegetables to host a salad extravaganza at the hostel.

We've been down on the river cooling off and that has been real chill. I hiked in shoes today and there is no problem with the toe at all. I'm just caught in the vortex with this beautiful young woman and could really care less. There was a time this evening when I became quite sad and I believe that was my gut telling me to remember why I'm even out here. It's to hike the AT. Sunrise is here and she noticed the look on my face. I'm not good at masking my emotions and told her I need to figure out what the heck I'm doing.

There was a bit of climbing to do and I reached a bald with 360° views by 3PM. I just plopped down and promptly fell asleep in the grass. The wind was blowing my kilt up and some day hikers woke me up. You can imagine what that was like. I figured I'd wait to see how Panda was doing with her sprain and hung out some more. We were on a bald near sunset last week and it was epic so a group of us gathered here to cook and camp. An early end to hiking but still not bad after sitting around for 5 days.

Was planning on getting ahead of the crew and having some goodies to share with them when others rolled in at the end of the day. I couldn't hitch so I was walking down the road when a van stopped and asked if I needed a ride. We were driving and he asked where I was headed, turned out I was still 30 miles south of where I needed to be. Oops. He was nice enough to return me to the trail and I only did 14 trail miles due to sore feet. Hate pavement. I was so pissed at myself for misreading the guide but got over it by the time I hit camp. I'm in a n awesome pine grove behind the shelter. Ate a lot of food and drank plenty of water. Prepping for a big day tomorrow. Went to bed early so not much social time for me.

I wanted to up my average so I can still bank up some zero days if I get sick or am injured again. I hiked through an area of rhoddies in full bloom at Carved Gap. The day was mostly above 5600 feet and the highlands are in bloom. There were hundreds of day hikers out for the scenery and many were weighted down with camera gear and everything else REI sells. Been there done that. I stopped to check out Overmountain Shelter and saw Sunrise and Chuckles. The spot is incredible with a valley view from the lower barn deck. I felt like camping atop the next ridge so I kept going. When I climbed Hump Mountain I got views of three states with the benefit of cool breezes and solitude. It was the most impactful experience to date. I could never capture that in photos. You'd just have to be there. After that I decided to keep going. I wound up coming all the way down the mountain, skirting a bull, and getting picked up by a cool transplant from California. He got me to the market and dropped me at a hostel. There were other hikers there and they fed me spaghetti with garlic bread. After a long day there is nothing better than having someone else cook for you.

Patsquach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538667,Today was a Nero for me. I took my time and followed the side trails to see Jones Falls and spent a couple hours at Elk River. The Elk River site was especially neat due to an FGM project that had been done there. FGM is fluvial geomorphology. It happens that I learned about it at PennDOT. We did a good bit of stream relocation and other work and FGM was the latest and greatest thing. Probably still is. It's basically using man made obstacles and other treatments to help both the stream banks and the watercourse itself. I doubt many people could appreciate the work that was done there. I had a nice flat rock to just sit on and be quiet. Had a good soak and swim to recover from yesterday. Later I went up to the next shelter and met 4 others. There was also a set of waterfalls made by a trail crew to provide a natural shower. That was hella nice. Good night to be in a shelter since it rained and rained and then rained harder. Sounded like it would have crushed my tent. There were huge spiders in the shelter but I wasn't missing any fingers or toes the next morning.,"Mountain Harbour Hostel

We hitched into town for Subway and some McDonalds (to remind myself why I don't eat it). We reached Bob later and he came into town to pick us up. Bob's place has been operating for 20 years and he has had over 20000 guests. There is no WiFi so we all were forced to talk to each other. Times like that make it apparent how much we can isolate socially even sitting at the same table. It was a great evening with 4 backpackers, another guest, Bob, and his 17 cats. Yep.

They do community dinners and allowed me to choose meatballs for everyone. We all cooked and drank some wine for a fine evening. It's impossible to stay up late even with great company though. Had the best night sleep ever in the new bunk house and always appreciate clean sheets. Jim and Jordan are the proprietors and turns out Jordan had lived in Dormont. Small world. Actually me another guy from Dormont southbound yesterday. We agreed that we should get Stanley Cup hiking shirts to remind everyone. This is a new place with work to be done so I'll see if I can help out tomorrow and perhaps impress them with some cooking again. There are 40 miles between here and Damascus. Many try to do it in a day since there are no more huge mountains for a while. I'm drinking tons of water and curious to see if I can do it. I'll decide later. While I'm here I'll also try to straighten out my broken pole situation. I've also had a lot of trouble sleeping with whatever is going on in my right hip.

Jim had a small fryer and three other hikers came in to help prep all the vegetables. Started with some fries and garlic wings as an appetizer. By the time the other s had returned we were ready to build massive salads with fries and cheese on top. An easy way to get your starches fat and protein. I loved making a half gallon of buttermilk ranch to go along with it. After dinner the wine came out and we enjoyed some music and ice cream (thanks Rainbow Momma).

Tempted to go swimming but I needed to hike today. The climb back up the ridge was a few miles and continued to roll up and down (mostly up). At one point while I was in my zone I walked into a bear. We were both shocked and luckily he ran away from me. It took 6 miles to get to water again so I cameled up and rested a bit.

The coyote are active in the valley below me. There are bears up here so all my gear and food is hung up in the trees. I'm 3 feet from the trail sleeping out on my ground cloth.

It was 5 miles to the next water source so I was anxious to get going. My legs weren't. Thoughts of a 30 mile day soon vanished. At least the terrain was easy. After drinking a couple liters at the next spring things picked up. I passed three groups of students on the trail heading the opposite direction. Everyone looked clean and I could smell the soap. They could probably smell me too, but it wouldn't be as nice. I came across 3 trail volunteers and thanked them for all their hard work. One said that she is weird and likes doing it. The oldest one said they also accept tips. All three were older than my parents. I often see the more ""seasoned"" folk on trail crews. There are other crews I've heard of, and I'll likely join them in the future. Back on the trail I decided to stop at a shelter for lunch and take a nap. I've heard of people starting early in the AM and then resting and eating after 1 PM before hiking again around 4 PM. Today was perfect for it. Had a nap and some chilli mac. Hiking was slow after a big meal, but within an hour I was fine and everything started to cool off. I took plenty of breaks and drank about 7 liters of water today. Still had 2 hours of light left when I stopped for the night. I'm in a freshly painted shelter (covers graffiti) with a southbound section hiker named Sideways. He had a lot of good tips in different foods for protein instead of all simple sugars and I intend to try them out.
