Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533209,"A glorious first day of our 150 mile section hike. Since we arrived a day early in NC, we decided to start our hike a day sooner than planned. I'm hiking with Turtlestone/ Jenny. Her husband Tim drove us back the 6 mile dirt forest service road to start our trek. The forest was especially beautiful today and the trail was fairly easy. Spent all of the day above 4,000 ft. Our highest point was Standing Indian Mountain at 5,435 ft. Grand mountain views from the summit. Spending the nite in our tents by Carter Gap shelter. Tonight's forecast is 37 degrees with high winds.....good sleeping weather!","Deep Gap

Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533628,"Beauty all around...and then the killer climb to the top of Alberts Mt. Lots of precarious rock scrambles for my short legs. BUT we conquered... And our reward, a gorgeous view from 5,250 ft. Jenny climbed the fire tower for an even better look. I tried, but just couldn't get past the first flight if open stairs. The path beyond Albert was much kinder all the way to Long Branch Shelter where we spent the night. We were joined by a lovely older couple and then 9 young Baptist youth ministers who were in a bachelor party hiking trip. They serenaded us aound their campfire with harmonizing religious songs accompanied by a ukelele and tamborine. HEAVENLY !","Carter Gap Shelter

Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533631,"Still no open blossoms on the millions of rhododendrens, but lots of wild flowers of all colors. The deciduous forest was amazingly green and full of squirrels, chipmunks, and birds. Most of the rocks we encountered were near Rock Gap shelter where we stopped for a break. Only half of the shelter survived from a giant tree falling on it a few weeks back. Luckily no one was hurt. Found trail magic (food and drinks set out by a trail angel) shortly before finishing up at Winding Stair Gap where Tim picked us up to go to his campground down the road.","Long Branch Shelter

This is a good chance to mention that I am backpacking for a cause as well as for fun. I'm collecting donations for Steve Sanders, a friend and member of my church, who is battling cancer. Checks can be made out to Pittsfield Community Church with Steve's name noted. Thank you to all who support in this endeavor.

Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533833,"5-18-16. First hour uphill then not too tough until the last climb of the day. Stopped at Wayah Bald stone tower (elev. 5,342ft) for a long break. It was my best views ever so far on the AT. The clouds also gave it an interesting twist. Made good time getting to Cold Spring Shelter even considering the last big climb. The shelter was right on the trail and soon filled up since only held 6. It was a treat having the spring just 20ft in front of shelter. Met numerous interesting people both in the shelter and camping nearby.","Wayah Gap

Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534037,"5-19-16   It was too cloudy between the mountains for any views while above 5,000ft. until later in the morning. We did get a great view from Wesser Bald. Jenny got the best view from the observation tower. Passed through miles of lush green forest again today seeing even more wild flowers, azaleas, and mountain laurel. Stopped at Wesser Bald Shelter where we had planned to spend the night but felt strong so moved on. A rugged steep climb took us to a fabulous view from ""The Jump Off"". Then a rocky decent with some scrambles led us to our shelter for the night.","Cold Spring Shelter

Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534188,5-20-16   We laughed and talked around the campfire last night with the 3 young men that joined us at the shelter. But it was a tough night sleeping cuz one of them snored LOUDLY all night. I might have gotten a half an hour of sleep. Luckily we only had a one mile to hike to NOC where we met with Tim for resupply. NOC is a popular outdoor adventure destination on the Nantahala River Gorge. Spent most of the day watching kayakers shoot the rapids and falls. We also got to eat real food then spent the night in a bunkhouse room to rest up for the next few days back on the AT.,"A.

Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534316,"5-21-16 After a great night of sleep in the bunkhouse and a bountiful breakfast at the River's Edge Restaurant the torture began. The first 5.8 miles was almost completely uphill and steep. The original blazers must not have believed in switchbacks. It was so tough for me that I'm rather sure my teeth were sweating. I had to take lots of rest breaks, the best being at the Jump Up where the views were panoramic of the mountains all the way down to the Nantahala Gorge. By the way, Nantahala is Cherokee for ""River of the Noonday Sun."" Avoided the rain and arrived at Sassafras Gap Shelter where several others were also spending the night. Hawaii, New York, and England among other homes were represented.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534480,"5-22-16.   It rained off and on through the night, but our shelter stayed dry. Ended up with 20 hikers in the camp. Our first 4 miles of trail was a roller coaster of slippery mud and rocks. We hiked sometimes with Chuckles and Tag Along, 2 older ladies from Alaska. Unbelievably, talked to Karen Farago, from the same home town in Ohio as me. She was working on a crew doing trail maintenance, looked at me and said ""I recognize you"". She had seen my story in the local newspaper about hiking to raise money for Steve Sanders' cancer medical bills. SMALL WORLD! Had a few good views today before our downhill to Stecoah Gap, where Tim had set up trail magic for the hikers. We took a long break there sitting in the sun, shoes off, eating all sorts of goodies with the other passerby's. The first mile after the gap was a steep climb followed by the really steep climb called Jacob's Ladder (600 ft. Elevation climb in .6 mile ). OMG! It was a quick steep descent to Brown Fork Gap Shelter for the night. Good company again.","Sassafras Gap Shelter

Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534827,"5-23-16   Had a great night's sleep, 12 hours in my sleeping bag. Had only 4 in the shelter and 3 outside, all very interesting. We took our time packing up and moving down the trail since it would be a short mile day. It was a mostly easy hike with a few nice spots to stop. Upon arrival at the shelter we were greeted by a 5 ft. black snake sunning himself. Had extra time so I soaked my feet in the stream right by the shelter. So far it's just us and John, an Outward Bound counselor from Florida that we met previously on the trail.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter
",Cable Gap Shelter,"May 23, Mon",6.10
Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534848,"5-24-16   Had interesting conversation last night with Jenny, John, Shoemaker, and Dallas. Up at 6:30AM, the usual time, to get ready for our fairly steep 2 mile climb out. Then it was all down to Fontana Dam Marina area where we dropped our packs with Tim to continue the next 2.5 miles as a slack pack hike with lots of views of Fontana Lake. We checked into Fontana Lodge to take a day off tomorrow.    PS   Slipped on a muddy down today for my first fall of this section, and hopefully my last.","Cable Gap Shelter

Relaxed, ate, did laundry, repacked backpack, ate, relaxed, swapped pictures with Jenny, ate, showered AGAIN, ate, made this entry, slept. Nice having a zero day especially since tomorrow's climb into The Great Smokey National Park will be a real challenge. Onward and upward!!!","GSMNP southern boundary

Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535732,"5-26-16.   Startedhikingat7:30AM.We wanted an early start cuz we knew The GSMNP started with some long climbs. I started running out of gas on some of the steeper ones. Glad to have Turtlestone for my hiking partner, cuz even though she is a HIKING MACHINE she adjusts her speed to hang with me through the tough spots. We saw our first bear activity warning sign a few miles in, but no bears. Saw lots if bear scat, wild boar diggings, and Jenny saw some wild turkeys. It rained fir about half of our 6.5 hours of hiking which actually cooled us down and made it more pleasant. At the end of the hike the sun came out and turned the forest into a sauna. Arrived at the shelter nice and early and were joined by a few others. Everyone is keeping an eye and ear out for bears as we have heard about several sightings, including the attack a few weeks ago.","GSMNP southern boundary
",Mollies Ridge Shelter,"May 26, Thu",9.90
Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535733,"5-27-16.   The trail kicked my butt today. Lots of steep climbs. Passed over Rocky Top (like the song) 5,440 ft. and Thunderhead Mountain 5,527 ft. Highlights today: Safely seeing a mama bear and 2 cubs on the trail 30 yards ahead, seeing a male bear 20 yards off the trail watching us pass by, and last but not least, actually making it to the shelter after a grueling day!!!! Among others that we met at the shelter was Patman, a Trail Space reviewer, trying out some new gear.","Mollies Ridge Shelter
",Derrick Knob Shelter,"May 27, Fri",12
Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535734,"5-28-16. Most of our day was over 5,000 ft. with the highest being 5,607 ft. at Silers Bald. Saw 1 wild turkey and lots of bees & flies as the past few days. Met lots of people on the trail due to memorial day weekend. The AT moves in and out of NC and Tenn. through this area. There haven't been any signs but we know which state we're in by whether or not there is a privy at the shelter. So,the last 2 nights were in Tenn. and luckily we are back in NC for one of our few luxuries on the trail! Arrived st Double Spring Gap Shelter. There are 2 springs, one in NC and one in Tenn. Felt great to arrive early and not be exhausted.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535735,"5-29-16. Said ""wow"" a bunch today cuz of the awesome views from above 6,000 ft. Passed through more lush, grassy forest before transitioning to pines at the higher elevations. We added .8 miles to meet Tim and Pete at the Clingman Dome parking lot for a nice break and some real food. We switched to lighter packs to slack pack the rest of the day then started our climb to Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the AT, 6,667 ft. No views today since we were in the clouds. We had our picture taken at the top of the fire tower with signs for Steve and Joann Sanders (sending our prayers). The trail down had a few miles of Hansel and Gretel forest (dark, mossy dead trees and tangled). Later we crossed over 2 wild boar containment bridges for protection of the beech trees in that area. We descended down through greener areas again to meet up with our sherpas again at Newfound Gap (US 441). Took a few pics at the NC/TENN state line. They drove us to their campsite in Cherokee for showers and a great dinner. We really did a total of 11.2 miles so a real bed was a welcome for the night.","Double Springs Gap Shelter
",Newfound Gap,"May 29, Sun",10.40
Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535737,"5-30-16. Nice relaxed morning then the guys drove us back to Newfound Gap to start back on the trail. It was a pleasant 3 mile climb cuz we talked most of the time with 2 day hikers from Florida who were interested in learning about backpacking. It made the time go so much faster. Arrived at our shelter by 1:30. It was sunny and cool with a fabulous view from just under 6,000 ft. Spoke to lots of hikers this last day of the holiday weekend passing by the shelter right on the AT. Most were out to see Charlies Bunyon (only a mile away). We would liked to have hiked farther but the next shelter and water sources just didn't work for us. Basking in the sun was much better after spending so much time in the forest. Hope you all had a blessed Memorial Day. God bless America!!!! PS At 7pm we had a pop up TORRENTIAL rain storm. Sooooo glad to be in the dry shelter. Princess Peach serenaded us during the downpour with an absolutely beautiful rendition of ""Rocky Top"". Afterwards we all shared in the joy of seeing a wonderous rainbow from our mountain top vantage point. Nature is AWESOME!!!","Newfound Gap
",Icewater Spring Shelter,"May 30, Mon",3
Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536294,"5-31-16. Woke up early to see the sunrise. Hiked out to have breakfast at Charlies Bunyon (5,522ft) with a magnificent view. Experienced vertigo before and for a distance after the Bunyon cuz of straight down drop offs along the narrow ridge trail. Lots of great views today including The Sawteeth and Eagle Rocks. Mostly rocks, roots, ridges and rain today. And of course some tough climbs. Saw another bear just ahead on our trail shortly before arriving at Tri Corner Knob Shelter. Full house of hikers, most had seen bears today. We all saw one bear right by the shelter that just didn't want to leave. One of the tenters had a boot stolen by some sort of animal. Should be an interesting night.","Icewater Spring Shelter
",Tri-corner Knob Shelter,"May 31, Tue",12.10
Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536295,"6-1-16. Luckily no bears came in for the night. Heard later that one walked right next to the shelter shortly after we left this morning. We were able to take our time hiking to our next hut due to lower miles and easier terrain. Checked out an old plane crash site on our way. Arrived early at the shelter ahead of another large group of fun people. There were so many that several had to pitch tents. It rained hard starting at 6PM, but luckily we were all settled inside and dry. Two wildlife park rangers showed up at 6:30 dripping wet and packing tranquilizer guns & bear tracking antenae along with their other gear. They were a wealth of information for us. There are now 20 to 25 people here. It could get interesting with the bear snares being set up as I type!!! Bear sighting stories are flying everywhere. Two FBI agents there told of how at their shelter the day before a bear came very close to one of them a stole his backpack. Since it contained some important FBI items, they decided to go after it. They trailed the bear, spotted it ripping through the bag, waited 20 minutes for the show to end, and because the bear ran off were able to retrieve what was left of it. They got back all of the important items they hoped for. Jenny, who always brings extra food, was quick to share with the young man who had lost all of his. She is always so thoughtful and protective. Sometimes I call her MOM!!!","Tri-corner Knob Shelter
",Cosby Knob Shelter,"Jun 01, Wed",7.70
Crazy legs ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536297,"6-2-16. Quiet night....no bears. Heard later down the trail that a problem bear had been caught shortly after we left our shelter in one of the snares that the rangers had set up last night. Wish we could have watched the process of tranquilizing, measuring, ear tagging, tooth pulling, blood sampling, and radio collaring like the others that hadn't left yet. We had a great last day of our trek though. Today's trail was mostly downhill with a few obligatory climbs. We were blessed with some nice views, a dear staying near us on the trail, seeing several hikers we knew, and ending with an easy path following cascading waters along a lovely stream. Our 2 sherpas, Pete and Tim, were waiting for us at the end with lots of trail magic snacks. They drove us back to their new campground in Sevierville, Tenn. for a shower, dinner, and a peaceful end to our adventure. THANK YOU JENNY/TURTLE STONE for being my ""Sole sister"" and sharing this experience with me. Steve and Joann Sanders, I thought of you every day and hope the best for you both. See you soon!","Cosby Knob Shelter
