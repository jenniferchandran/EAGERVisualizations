TP,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548958,"We started hiking around 3:00 pm after arriving in Atlanta. Thanks to Kelly and Jim for the ride from the Atlanta Airport! The weather was great - warm and sunny. We were warned by the park ranger about the on-going drought in the area and the lack of water on the trail. I filled up my Camelback for additional water. The first five miles were mostly uphill with lots of stairs. We ended up camping at a site on top of Frosty Mountain. I slept great in the woods, as usual.","Amicalola Falls State Park

TP,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549089,It started raining as we were packing up the tents. We left camp about 9:00 am and crossed over onto the starting point for the AT on Springer Mountain (mile 8.8) at about noon as the rain increased in intensity. It poured most of the day today - we got soaked. But we hiked. So much for a drought today. At about 4:00 pm we got to the Hawk Mountain Shelter and the trail was starting to flood. The shelter was close to standing room only as hikers waited out the rain. Luckily the rain let up at about 6:00 pm and we set up tents for the night. I slept fairly well even though everything was kind of wet.,"Frosty Mountain

TP,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549093,"The rain was over and it turned out to be a nice, sunny day today. The creek near the shelter this morning was still flowing but much less than the day before during the rain. We filled up on water. We started hiking at about 9 am but two fairly large mountains (Sassafras and Justus Mountain) that we had to cross slowed me down and wore me out. We camped at a campground near Gooch Gap about 5:00 pm and tried to dry out our still-wet stuff. Found a creek that was still flowing and filled up on water but most everything else had dried up. I enjoyed a good dinner of couscous and salmon. A not too great night sleep that night because my sleeping bag was still damp.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

TP,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549175,"Another nice, hot, sunny day today, good hiking. Left about 9:00 am and got to Woody Gap about noon. Warning signs were up there that indicated there was no water until Neel Gap (11 miles) which had water from a faucet. There were some water jugs left by ""trail angels"" so we filled up. We also hiked solo from then on due to different hiking speeds and different distance goals. I made it to the Blood Mountain Shelter about 6:00 pm with less than two liters of water left for that night and about a 4 mile hike over Blood Mountain the next day to Neel Gap. All streams/water sources were bone dry. I dined on dry gorp in the evening to conserve water. Slept great.","Gooch Gap

TP,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549398,"Started the day at the Blood Mountain Shelter with little water left but with about a 4 mile hike over Blood Mountain remaining. Another sunny, hot day today. The only stream along the way was dry. The view on top of Blood Mountain was spectacular. It was a tough climb but I got over alright using up the last of my water just before I got to Neels Gap. When I got to Neels Gap I ran into two thirsty southbound hikers who indicated that everything was dry for at least the next 10 miles to the point where they had started on the trail and did not know about the situation beyond that. A family whom we had met two nights before offered a ride into town if I needed it. Fifteen minutes of deciding whether to continue with no water in sight or to bag it and get a ride. I reluctantly decided to take it safe and resume the hike next year. It was a great hike though! To be continued in 2017...","Blood Mountain Shelter
