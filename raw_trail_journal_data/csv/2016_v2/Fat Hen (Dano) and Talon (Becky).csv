Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523675,"So, a slight delay in plans. We will end up leaving tomorrow. After staying up until 5 am this morning, Fat Hen and I determined that maybe we should take an extra day to tie up loose ends. We will also be starting our adventure a lot more chipper. And when you think about it, a day makes no difference when you're looking at this sort of opportunity. It's not a race nor do we have to punch a time card. We'll get there Part of our scramble comes from the fact that we only decided to do this a couple of months ago. It has been a life long dream of mine since my grandfather walked it twice (back in the 70's before it was cool!). And Fat Hen thought it seemed crazy enough to join, which was pretty amazing in my book  But after a few hiccups in our lives we decided ""why not now""? So here we are!It has come to my attention that not everyone who reads this knows who we are, fantastic I say! We will try not to bore everyone with our musings  We are from Upstate/central New York (not the city), we love Thai food, bad science fiction movies and, adventures.

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524129,"Hi kids! We made it to Springer Mountain! It is in my belief that everyone should start with the approach trail. 1) it's beautiful 2) you learn ALOT. QUICK. We quickly confirmed we were overweight! As semi expected after finishing the 2000 foot assent of the approach trail, we took a night to do a pack shakedown, exchange some of our gear, and make some last minute gear cuts. Now we are off to start the trail with our revamped packs... We laugh thinking, ""how many times will our gear change in this 2200 mile journey? Maybe we'll be satisfied by Mt. Katahdin. With lighter packs, we have a renewed sense of optimism and we shall move forward Lessons learned:We're horribly out of shapeCarry lots of water/ more than you think you needDon't walk in the dark unless you know where you're going When setting up your tent, look up. We nearly set our tent under a dangling 20 foot long branch Instant coffee, not coffee/percolatorThe top of a mountain is merely an illusion, it never actually comes aroundDon't forget to look around you, you're in an amazing place Until next time folks","USFS 42?

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525128,"Hi kids!Our apologies on the lack of journal entries. We have been trying to concentrate on the trail itself, not just writing about it  It's been a long week full of lessons and we are learning and adapting as we go. What a week it has been! We've seen 70 degrees and sunny, we've woken up with an inch of snow on our tent, and we've had fog so thick we couldn't see 5 feet ahead of us. Adapting your clothing to just about any weather is important and we're getting the knack of it after this week. Weather fun aside, we also got to experience our first trail magic! The first was from the ""trail devils"" who handed out donuts and soda for a late breakfast  The second was a group of ladies that made pork and beans for everyone on the trail, as well as, brownies, veggies and apples. These random acts of kindness have been an amazing part of our journey and they are so very appreciated. The people are all volunteers, just trying to help out another generation of hikers. On that note we have met many people along the way who have given us excellent advice. We climbed Blood Mountain with ""Gutsy"" who, at 64 years old has hiked the AT, PCT , and is working on the CDT. She was a wealth of knowledge and a huge help to our inexperienced selves. Everyone thus far has been great, we've met good folks from all over the U.S., from all different walks of life. All in all we are having a great time. We are sore and tired, blistered and bruised, but loving every minute. Counting the brutal 10 mile approach trail (Dan's mom bravely joined on, well done Teresa!) we have now climbed 80 miles of mountainous terrain! Bear with us as we'll try to flirt into reception more and keep the posts and pictures coming!","Dick's Creek

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525424,"Easter surprise!As Easter Sunday approached, Becky and I decided to pick up our pace a bit and make it to Dicks Creek Near 76 and hitchhike towards Hiawasee. In hopes of finding a Catholic Church and grabbing a couple more days of food to push toward our next resupply near NOC. After a 13 mile day, we found route 76 and caught a ride with a van full of college hikers after about a mile or so. They stopped right by a Mc Donald's which resulted in Becky and I shamelessly piling the food in our trough until eventually feeling full. Finding a Catholic Church down here in the southern baptist Bible Belt proved challenging... As the evening approached we discovered every hostel and hotel to be booked in the area, and our only hope for shelter would be to try to hitchhiking back to the trail, to camp and give up on finding an Easter Mass. That's when we saw several friends, amongst them Pops and Nado, who we affectionately consider members of out trail family. They offered us shelter in their room for the night. A hot shower and laundry service was a welcome comfort. With a place to stay we decided in the morning to hitch hike over to Hayseville, to the Immaculate Heart of Mary church. Through the generosity of 2 drivers we made it there! The welcoming kindness of the congregation was unmatched! They even had us bring up the communion gifts! Afterwards Bob and Michelle invited us to their home to share Easter breakfast with their family. And Bud and Pat invited us to Easter dinner! Becky and I had a wonderful time at both and wonderful food with wonderful company! Bob and Michelle sent us with a thermos of coffee, something I have been truly missing on the trail! Pat and Bud sent us with a bunch of leftovers which we enjoyed along with our trail family. In the evening Pops and Nado kindly offered us to stay the night, and a campfire and songs with the guitar ensued. The kindness and generosity of everyone made it the best Easter I can remember, and a perfect day of rest for our tired bodies. With only 1 day rest it felt like a week, and now it's back to the trail!","

Monday afternoon we pushed past the NC boarder, 78.5 miles on the trail and 88.5 counting the approach trail! Miles sound so innocent when you lost them in a number... Each one of those miles consisted of traversing up and down mountainous terrain. Changing thousands of feet in elevation. Up hills leaving you exhausted and downhills destroying your knees and ankles. 88.5 miles so far... Its not just a number, but a tremendous accomplishment.","

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525423,"It's not everyday that you can find someone willing to go live in a tent, poop in holes, drink from streams and smell bad for 6 months. Not to mention walking more than you've ever walked in your life...all in the middle of nowhere...But as I sit here at our campsite looking around at everyone munching their cold oatmeal and their cold pop tarts, I realize how lucky I am to have a crazy wonderful partner like Fat Hen. I just had to follow the icy pop tart stares as Dan approaches with curry -egg stuffed avocados with ham and biscuits. Who knew a breakfast like this existed in the wilderness? It was merely because Dan is willing to carry things like this on his back. People have been picking on him for his pack weight but they don't realize that he does it to make our journey more enjoyable and comfortable. Although our canned ham has become the stuff of legend. It is now known to several hikers as a unit of weight and measurement. "" How much do you think that weighs"" "" probably 4 hams"" It's been great fun So thanks to Fat Hen for his encouragement, support, motivation, inspiration and ingenious ideas.I would not be standing here on this mountain without him ( Albert mountain to be exact). And I would be still munching cold pop tarts somewhere...","Beech Gap

Our mileage by the end of today will total to be about 150 miles (140 on the AT alone). It has truly been an amazing journey this far and we are enjoying every minute of it! Including terrible thunderstorms and cold nights  we're taking a ""nero"" day today. That equals, very few miles. Yesterday's terrible downhills and the promise of real food has inspired us to take a small break. Considering this is only our second one in 15 days, we're not doing too bad  15 days!?!? Can you believe it!?!? Time is so strange out here, Dan and I keep commenting that it feels like we've been gone both, 3 days and 3 months at the same time. It is a true adventure though and we are so grateful for it all. A special thanks to our moms for our first of many packages today  they have to deal with our ridiculous requests like shoe polish, banana chips and peanut butter And a promise that we do try to post as often as we can And for anyone who's wondering yes, we do smell at this point","NOC

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527050,"Becky and I descended into the Fontana Dam shelter, known to thru-hikers as the Fontana Hilton, so named for it unusual lavishness. The shelter can comfortably sleep 20-24 people, and has all the amenities modern society has taught us we need to survive, such as a solar cell phone charging station, nearby flushable toilets and a shower with an over worked water heater. Comforts as it turns out, Becky and I do quite fine without these days. We placed our sleeping pads in a top corner of the shelter, ditched our packs and detoured to check out the dam. A true marvel of human engineering, built hastily during war time to power aluminum manufacturing and secretly power the Oakridge facility in Tennessee, refining Uranium for the Manhattan project. (We visited Oakridge on a road trip 2 years ago, and highly recommend it. For $5 we enjoyed a 3 hour bus tour that even brought us right in to see the worlds first graphite nuclear reactor) we then wandered into Fontana, where we had a food box waiting for us at the lodge. The walk appeared to be only .4 miles but was actually more than 2.5 on a winding road with no shoulders. A fellow hiker, 'Beast' passed by with family he was visiting, and relieved us of our traffic-dodging after a mile and a half or so. They kindly dropped us at the lodge where we found our 2nd mail drop, a beautifully packed assortment of foods, thanks to Judy and my mom, Teresa. (Love you both!) To my personal delight they had a coffee machine that dispensed liquid gold at the push of a button, while Becky enjoyed the hot chocolate packets, that were sitting in a never ending pile. We mainlined about 6 cups while we went though our box and raided a big table of other goodies that hikers mailed to themselves and now decided to abandon due to the fact that ounces become pounds rather quickly in a backpack. We walked to a gas station a half mile down the road and I purchased several ice cream bars/cones for Becky who has dreamed of ice cream daily. I flagged down a shuttle that was passing by and we returned to the shelter where we chatted with friends and called it a night. A fantastic storm raged outside, and morning came to find all the tenters drying their gear over nearby fences. Becky and I crossed over the dam to began out ascent into the Smokies!","Cable Gap

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527051,"Becky and I reached the edge of the Great Smokey Mountains where we dropped our permits into an over stuffed (apparently never checked or emptied) drop box and officially entered the Smokies. Our packs now freshly supplied, and at full weight we ascended the roughly 3500 foot elevation climb, stopping at the peak of Shuckstack mountain to climb the old fire tower there. It was a climb that could shurely curl the eyelashes of someone leery of heights. Despite the unsavory sight of formerly structural metal pieces sprinkled about the ground below, the steps seemed to be rather freshly replaced pressure treated lumber, so we decided to brave a climb. We chose to 2-hand the railing due to the 35 mph sustained wind, and the breezy 50 mph gusts that our weather radio warned of and Mother Nature delivered. The tower creaked and groaned in the hostile wind but failed to fall from under us. At the base of the tower we found cell reception and checked in back home. We continued on through wild wind, some sun and some popcorn kernel sized hail, for 12 miles to find the shelter full due to the impending storm. We set up our tent, made dinner and hoped for the best as we called it a night. Despite the 20 degree night, wind and more than an inch of icy snow, Becky and I stayed warm, thanks in part to the Mylar blanket we put under our rain fly  We chose to take a lighter day and only walk 6 miles to break the pace from a larger group, and secure a shelter space tonight since they are calling for part 2 of the storm. We managed to find a sufficient supply of dry-ish dead wood and have a roaring fire in the shelter's fireplace, everyone called it a night and crawled off to sleep while I stayed up with Becky, stoking the fire. I made us a hot cup of tea over the fire as we watched the fire for hours sipping tea and nibbling on chocolate. I suppose like all timeless moments, they end too soon. Time to crawl into our sleeping bags and listen to the storm rage outside, while we search for sleep.","Fontana Dam

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527699,"Hey kids!Dan and I have now reached mile 207 at Newfound Gap. If you add up the Approach Trail and other various journies, we're closer to 225 miles. It's pretty crazy when you start adding these numbers, it gives you a feeling of great accomplishment. We have also passed the highest point on the AT, Clingmans Dome (6,643ft). Which was full of gawking tourists complaining about the half mile walk to the observation tower. It was an interesting (and motivating!) experience going back to society for a few minutes  This has been a challenging couple of days for us. We have experienced some of the coldest temperatures yet, going well below our gear limits. The ridge runner told us low teens for the one night, so Dan spent multiple hours collecting dry firewood in a forest soaked in frozen rain and snow for the shelter's fireplace, and even stayed up late, and got up several times to stoke the fire, so we could all stay at a rational temperature.

It was mostly ice and frozen mud, but the sun would come out and make the top layer of mud melt. We treated the trail instead like a slip and slide.

We then rolled into Gatlinburg, TN to resupply and repair some of our gear (and ourselves).There were a few things we needed a few things in order to complete our trek through the Great Smoky Mountains.While we were there we learned a very important lesson, our insatiable appetites are uncharted territory.

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530006,"The rest of the Smoky Mountains went well. We were treated to more of the views that prior to this journey only existed in paintings that would receive complaints of looking fake and unrealistically perfect. Our descent into Hotsprings was on a hot balmy day, where the 2 1/2 liters (5lbs each) of water each of us carries, was inadequate... Without a dry inch on us, and dying of thirst, we noticed it getting foggy in a nearby gap, despite it being inappropriate weather for fog. As we approached Hotsprings, the air turned thick with what we now confirmed was smoke. We safely reached Hotsprings and local town-folk confirmed it was a forest fire raging in the mountains that ended up closing 14 miles of the trail just days behind us. We are constantly reminded that we are truly out in the wilderness, where our concerns of comfort are often replaced with concerns of safety.      Hot springs was a fantastic small rural town, friendly and accommodating. We went to the post office and acquired our resupply boxes, stopped at a local store and purchased a few ounces of fuel to top off our bottle. Our little Svea 123 stove has proven to be well worth it's weight in brass. It is extremely fuel efficient, and on blisteringly cold mornings and evenings it runs like a raped ape. While other campers try every trick in the book to keep their small butane stoves warm enough to function, ours is a work horse in all weather. Add 1/2 teaspoon of fuel around the stem, flick a spark at it to preheat the fuel vaporizer and build tank pressure, and away it goes, hot and reliable in every condition we have thrown at it! Like many of my ideals and philosophies, it's a relic from a bygone era, when engineering and heirloom quality were worth the extra weight. We camped on the trail down near the river where we found some of our friends from early on and enjoyed catching up on each other's experiences, stories and lessons learned thus far on our journey. On our ascent out of Hotsprings we camped atop of Max Patch Bald. To this day I have seen few sunsets and rises that can come close to the beauty and serenity seen in that 360 view and color extravaganza. Thankfully some friends snapped a couple pictures of us silhouetted in the evening and morning and later shared them with us, some of our favorite pictures of all time.","Hot Springs

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530013,"Protecting our food and gear from the wildlife is an ongoing agenda, I woke up the other morning around 5am to the sound of a squirrel attempting to steal and decipher the locking lid of our cook pot. I reached out to retrieve it and found the squirrel had no intentions of giving up his newly discovered prize. I pulled, and he pulled back. Our tug of war game was short lived but quite memorable. Upon my victory he ran off into the night with a loud raspy screech at me. As I rapped my head around this unusual interaction I just had, I heard a camper in the distance yell out in shock,""hey! What the heck!? Go on, get out of here!"" And the squirrels' raspy screech... Poor squirrel.     Our journey continued though a very cold rain, in which our rain gear failed again within an hour or two. We have accepted the inevitable fact that we will get wet in the rain. Either in sweat from unbreathable fabrics, or in rain penetrating breathable fabrics. In this case the rain was cold. Our body heat was slowly sapped away until we where mildly hypothermic. Our knees and ankles became stiff and clumsy, our fingers nonfunctional and our arms extremities rather clammy and numb. I could no longer feel how waterlogged my footwear was and we came upon a shelter in the rain, climbed in and quickly dried and donned dry clothes in an attempt to regain core temperature... In the evening the rain broke intermittently and we made dinner and had an early night.     Becky has always had a recurring problem with an ingrown toenail that waited until we were days from anywhere to return in full fury. Her large toe was bringing her to tears. It was large, bright red with infection and unable to even be touched. Amazing how simple annoyances become excruciating problems at the most inopertune times. How she continued to walk on it as far as she did I don't know. It inevitably became unbearable and lacking options due to our remote location, she elected to attempt to remove it herself. I made a bright campfire, she took a few swigs of the small flask of whiskey we had, and went to work on it. After her failed attempts, digging painfully into an infected toe without anesthesia, I tried my hand at it. (Requiring as much whiskey as Becky had!) I once again sterilized our mini scissors and tweezers and the surgery was a success. I cleaned and bandaged it with antibiotic ointment.The following day we made our way to Erwin to resupply. This marks mile 342 on the trail, and probably around 370 into our journey. Once again finding a remote spot by the river, this time near an old train trestle, and set up camp. We hitchhiked into town and enjoyed a nice all you can eat lunch at PizzaPlus. They had an old Atari Galaga arcade game that Becky and I reminisced while donating a few quarters. As one of my favorite Atari games of childhood, I discovered it was like riding a bike again, and ended up with the high score on it. We grabbed our supplies from the grocery store and hitchhiked back to the river, this time without any luck and walked the full 2 1/2 miles. Here by the river we have put our tender feet up (Becky's toe is doing quite well dispite the unpracticed improvised surgery) a local man nearby caught a nice bass that swallowed his hook and gave us his catch. I made a small campfire and an improvised grill of my own design (using railroad spikes from along the tracks) and enjoyed our fresh fish over the campfire. As we sat soaking in the last ounces of the evening sun we watched a large bald eagle come down from the mountain side and do a close low and slow flyby over the river in front of us, splash down and lift off with a fish dinner of his own. A truly remarkable sight that we are having a hard time believing we witnessed. It makes for a great ending to this beautiful evening. With the sound of the river, we'll hopefully have a good nights rest. In the morning we are back into the wilderness, hopefully missing the impending rain that is supposed to hit in the dead of night.And can you believe there are lightning bugs?","Erwin

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534505,"Out here we have found many challenges. Some of the challenges that we find are obstacles that exist out here, such as inclement weather, rough terrain, heavy packs, damaged gear, wild animals and our physical limitations. Though some of the challenges we find ourselves facing don't actually physically exist out here. These of course are the emotional and psychological challenges of a task like this. At times we find ourselves missing small things like Chinese food, or hot a shower... with soap, a can of soda or a cheap hotdog with mustard. Almost constantly though we miss some big things, like our family, our friends, a hot meal or cup of coffee with loved ones, the affection of our pets and the hope they understand our absence, a dry place to sleep when you're sick. Becky and I have chosen this journey knowing that not all of our challenges will be physical, and so far I feel we have handled them well.     Occasionally when hiking, Becky carrying 30-35 lbs, and myself around 40-50 lbs, despite all the beauty and peace and each other's great company out here, it is easy to have physical and emotional challenges all compound and start to get you down at times. Nearly every time this has happened though, we find our spirits lifted almost immediately and often by the least expected. Sometimes by reaching an elusive summit to find an unrealistic view, too perfect to exist stretched out as far as our eyes can see, a view only seen from one spot, only accessible by one way, climbing a mountain in the middle of the wilderness, and Becky and I get to share that with each other. Sometimes we find our spirits raised by a surprise ride in the back of someone's pickup truck when we are hitchhiking 10 miles into a town to resupply. But sometimes we have our spirits lifted by what hikers affectionately call trail magic. A stranger, goes out of their way to find a spot that hikers will cross, and they do something for you, or give you something (usually food) and the selfless act of kindness lifts your spirits every time. Sometimes it's simple, other times it's extravagant. We have stumbled on all sorts of magic out here... hamburgers, hotdogs, breakfast burritos, chips, oatmeal cookies, soda, beer, bananas apples, oranges, donuts, beans, and COFFEE!     Other times we find our own family's 'magic' for us... Sending us food in a package mailed to post offices, waiting for us to pass through and pick them up. Opening them to find a needed gear replacement, food, a note from our family, or an extra goody hiding in there that makes us smile. I'd like to thank each and every one of you for every bit of Trail Magic we've come across.Special thanks to:     Our parents Walter and Judy, Alan and Teresa, for all of your support, the mail drops, little notes etc.    My sisters Stacia and Alanna, for help with last minute gear swaps after the approach trail showed us obvious gear flaws.    A long time extension of my family, Dave and Maude for detouring on their road trip north, and timing it to meet and treat us to breakfast in Damascus! Good food and great company! And a parting gift or some real maple syrup     Dave and Greg, for the feta cheese and that truly amazing banana bread!     Complete strangers... If I forget to mention someone who is reading this I'm truly sorry, it's not that it didn't 'make the list' it's simply because I'm flawed and bound to leave someone out in error! Queen Diva, Bud, the group on beauty spot, Mark, Rachael & Apple Juice , Buuurn, the snacks left in the schoolhouse south of Atkins, the Burningtown Baptist church, and many others whose name escapes me as I write this.

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534511,"As Becky and I hiked Friday on approach to the Mt. Rogers visitor center that intersects the trail at mile 533, we decided in favor of returning to Damascus for the Trail Days Hiker festival. Trail Days is the largest event on the Appalachian trail, and the largest hiker festival of its kind in the world. We hitchhiked back to Damascus and camped Friday night and Saturday night, and hitchhiked back to the trail Sunday with time to still make it 12 miles. We didn't know what to expect of trail days. We heard it was a must-do for through hikers like ourselves. We also heard crazy tails of how wild if can be. Although Becky and I are are quite adventurous, we also aren't stupid. It was obvious that when a town whose population of 850 sees 20,000-30,000 people visit this festival, by percentage almost none of them are currently through hiking. The through hiking community we have found in the back country has been great. People help each other, no one seems to worry about theft. I suspect you could tape a $100 to your pack, leave it on the side of the trail, and find it untouched in a week. We both were skeptical of a festival that brings in so many people, many of which will camp in 'tent city' just to party for 3 days straight. We opted to camp outside of tent city, renting yard space run by a church for $5. By doing so, we were able to set up our tent, leave our packs and gear in it during the day, and sleep at night without the fear of a drunk/ high person tripping and falling through our tent at 3 in the morning. Best $5 spent. We had a great time running into our friends that are both ahead of us, and behind us. It was fun checking out gear displays, being able to pick up something and look at it instead of just seeing pictures online, to look at different tents set up instead of seeing measurements on a tag... man if we had that ability before we wandered in the woods! I wonder what our gear inventory would have looked like, or if it'd still be the same. We entered some gear give aways, no luck, but some people won some amazing gear! We enjoyed an all-you-can-eat pizza dinner at PizzaPlus, and an all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast at the 'One Way Ministry' who also provided free coffee all day with lots of snacks and small resupply items. One of the most beneficial parts of the festival for us was the free gear repair. We both had some major and minor issues with our packs. I have lost some weight around my hips and my hip strap was bottomed out as small as it could go. This was a major problem since around 80% of your pack weight should be supported by your hip belt, on your hips. As I lost the ability to tighten that belt properly, my pack hung lower and lower on my hips and my shoulders began taking too much of my pack's weight. Traversing rough terrain with a heavy load on your spine is a perfect recipe for a life of back problems. I hoped to fix this. Naturally my backpack company, Kelty, was not represented there. I talked to a competitor, Gregory, who said they would work on my pack, but after the service guys looked at it, they gave me a number of reasons why they couldn't do anything to help me. Which was a big let down. So we went to the Osprey repair guys to have a few torn pockets and a broken clip fixed on Becky's pack. Surprisingly they said they would look at my pack as well, but 'no promises'. They gave us some ticket stubs and when we returned that evening, Becky's repairs were all done as expected, and surprisingly so where mine. Talk about a great company! Even though my pack was made by a competitor, they dismantled my hip belt, found a way to shorten the plastic formers, reattach the hip straps further in and put it back together. I now have at least 4 inches of adjustment to spare! They also replaced my load adjuster straps which where worn and slipping. Later we found they also snuck both Becky and I a free extensive repair kit inside our packs (a small kit, jam packed with snaps, buckles, webbing, sewing awl/needle and heavy thread). Osprey did all this for free, A job that Gregory's techs said couldn't be done, and a job that my company, Kelty, wasn't even there to offer support their users in any way. Something to think about for anyone who wants to purchase a hiking pack. So we wander back into the woods now, with repaired gear, after seeing friends, eating great food, and having LOTS of great coffee! I guess Trail Days really is a must stop for all through hikers... Assuming your not one of the fools, still passed out around a smoldering bon-fire/ drum circle pit, who decides to go home after partying too hard!","Marion

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536405,"Again, our apologies on our lack of posts. It seems that we only have reception on mountain ridges. That will potentially change as we head north where AT&T is a little more common. We are at mile 727.5 in Daleville, VA. Which is about one third of the way through the trail. As we have mentioned before, time is strange out here. It seems like we've been out 3 days and 3 years all at the same time. So to hear that we're almost a third of the way through is both exciting and strange to us. Everyday you wake up, look at the guidebook and walk to your chosen destination. Then suddenly it starts to add up and we realize that we really are making progress. We can in fact, do this We were fortunate however to take a break over Memorial Day weekend. Dan's parents were kind enough to come 7 1/2 hours to pick us up so we could spend the weekend with family. Our families mean more than the world to us so any chance to see them is ok with us. I got the fun chance to surprise the pants off my family. We called from the driveway of my parents house and told them to save us some leftovers, right as we walked in the door. The look on their faces was priceless. It was a quick trip, and we tried to keep our visits limited to family (sorry for missing everyone, we love you and we'll see you when we're done!). It was great also to see our cats and chickens again. It's amazing how much you miss animals on the trail. I mean, we see plenty of wildlife but they're not quite as cuddly. Going home also gave us the opportunity to do the big switch from winter to summer gear. Instead of the massive amounts of postage it would take, we decided that while we were home it would be easier. We could also repair gear and resupply properly. A win win all around. I will also note that we have broken out mileage record. In order to make our pickup work we had to boogie ourselves to Daleville. We hiked 56 miles in 2 1/2 days. Two of those days were at 23.5 miles. thats a lot for us and we picked some of the roughest (and prettiest) terrain we've seen in a while. One day we hiked until 1:30 am. We don't recommend it. It was all worth it though and it was fun to see the limits of our abilities. We hope to increase our daily mileage from here on out. As always, we will go day by day and let that determine where and how far we go. We intend on enjoying this trail no matter how fast or slow.As I write this we are on 81 south, heading back to the trail and our adventure. We are excited to go back and hope our bodies haven't depleted too much. I think we were in more pain off trail than on trail (how does that work?) Looking forward to the next stage...","Damascus

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538869,"Becky and I approached Glasgow VA, a rather exciting event for us.For a moment step back in time 3 years, Becky, Beth, and I were on a road trip south, detouring for Americana, we passed through Glasgow and smiled for a picture in front of a fiberglass dinosaur. Four miles north of our target we discovered some of the best fried chicken I have ever experienced (located at the 'Natural Bridge Country Store'). Minutes later we saw a hitchhiker seeking a ride for resupply, and picked her up, an AT hiker named 'Whirled Peas' & dropped her at the grocery store, we detoured back to pick up a box of that fried chicken to surprise her with it when she came out of the grocery store (unknowingly giving our first 'trail magic'!!!)... We managed to swing by that small gas station the next year as well and the chicken again defended its title as best fried chicken ever. Last year to our horror while passing through, they were sold out for the day. So for three years now we've had a love affair with this small gas station that secretly makes the best fried chicken. Now here we are hiking the AT and hitchhiked ourselves, into Glasgow, but not without overshooting the town by four miles to purchase our 16 piece bucket, 2 liter of Dr. Pepper, and a half gallon or ice cream, ending our hitchhiking at the shelter in town. Glasgow kindly offers a shelter in town, that sleeps 12, has electric and an outside hot shower. Conveniently located within a 5 minute walk from resupply. We enjoyed a nice meal, the chicken is still the best fried chicken ever, plain and simple. In the morning we picked up 2 boxes of cereal to change things up, a box of frosted shredded wheat and a box of fruit loops. Then we hit the trail. A sentimental resupply to think that 3 years ago we gave an AT hiker a ride and now pass through hiking the AT, at mile 784 ourselves!","

With over 800 miles under the belt we still have to watch our step. In a four day period we've seen 12 bears, 2 huge momma bears with a total of 5 cubs, and 5 medium sized. We've seen 2 rattlesnakes, one huge one, over 3 1/2"" diameter and unknown length, coiled blocking the trail hissing at us, and one with half a bird hanging out of its mouth. I found a copperhead snake the old fashioned way... I stepped over to take a leak and peed on it. If I wasn't already peeing that would have initiated it! We enjoyed a slightly flatter terrain than we were used to, and the state parks have 'Waysides' that have food and over-priced supplies in the event you are in need of $7 pack of generic hot dogs. They did however have nice blackberry milkshakes and very good coffees! And delicious 95 cent cinnamon buns that were worth packing out to enjoy with coffee. We treated ourselves to a nice breakfast one day as well. And risked the pack weight to carry some beer to one of the lookout points and watch the sunset with a couple of our hiking friends. An awesome time to say the least. We wrapped our Shenandoah time up today making our way to Fort Royal for resupply. We are now at mile 969!","

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539436,"Becky and I awoke yesterday morning at Rod Hollow Shelter around 6, I made breakfast and coffee, and Becky packed up our bedding. We got the trail and soon after came to the beginning of a section of trail known as (and properly named) 'the roller coaster'. It consists of about 13 miles of relentless ups and downs, and nestled amongst it is the 1000 mile marker! While the small 6x12"" board is a simple little sign, it represented quite a milestone for is! We stopped at a camp site about 1/10 beyond, and celebrated with lunch and a hot ( and strong) cup of coffee! Then we continued on our way... The day before was an 18.5 mile day and we decided to push for another 18 miles, then it will just be a 12.5 to drop into Harpers Ferry. We stopped at Bears Den Hostel, (.2 miles off the trail) just long enough to purchase two 50 cent sodas to chug, and another two 'for the road'. We found ourselves out of the wilderness to cross VA 7, a 4 lane highway that was uncomfortably busy. Who would have guessed the yard-sale-purchased Atari game Frogger I had as a kid was actually preparing me for this real life scenario! With no extra lives or practice, we some how managed to make it across! By 8:45 we rolled into the BlackBurn AT Center, a donations excepted, free hostel cabin run by the PATC. We hadn't really expected much, but WOW. We descended to a cute cabin with 4 bunks, a small wood burning heating/ cooking stove, and front porch. As we were putting our packs down we were invited down to the large cabin with a beautiful wrap around, screened in porch. We met 'Trail boss', Chris and Sandy, the caretakers, who proceeded to serve us lemonade, huge bowls of soup, bread with butter, and chocolate chip cookies. It was getting dark out, so they brought us a candle to eat by. We couldn't believe our eyes, we hardly said a word the whole time we ate. We just sat there smiling at each other in the flickering light, enjoying our surprise candle-lit dinner, on the porch of a remote cabin, listening to peepers and night sounds. After dinner we went inside and helped clean up and found out Chris was responsible for the 'roller coaster' a 3 year project which eliminated a 17 mile section of trail that used to be on an asphalt road. We had feared our sick game of Frogger was our 1000 mile mark celebration... Instead we were treated to one of those too-perfect-to-be-real evenings, together.","Blackburn AT Center

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540225,"Around the first week in June I discovered a potentially fatal failure developing on my backpack. As a through-hiker, we are a gear designer's dream, we test a piece of gear in the real wild under real conditions. We test all of our gear, not as a person who's paid to go out for a week, use it and report back of the results of it's pampered use. Instead we test a piece of gear under every condition imaginable, daily for a half year, as if our life depends on it, because often it does. And if it fails, it most likely won't happen in a good place. So I didn't have a great feeling when I noticed a seam opening on my pack, right where the shoulder straps attach. I watched it open further daily, and contemplated ways of sewing it. I decided to report this problem to Kelty and see what they had to say. I sent them a picture and a nice service rep named Erin asked what color pack and where it can be sent! It seemed too good to be true, but I gave them the AT Conservancy headquarters address and picked green. Becky and I reached Harpers Ferry, took a day to see our nations capital in DC, and when we came back my replacement pack was waiting to save the day! I cut my old pack apart per Kelty's requirements and swapped everything to my new pack. My only concern now being the waist strap doesn't have a lot of adjustment but there appears to be enough (unless I lose more weight). I owe Kelty a big thank you for supporting their customers so efficiently! Now time to put some miles on this shiny new pack!","Harpers Ferry

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540958,"On our way into Harper's Ferry, Dan and I got a crazy idea into our heads of potentially visiting Washington D.C. There's a train station right in town that goes to Union Station and Dan has never been. We decided to look at our options more objectively, once we got into town.We reached the Conservancy near the end of the day and we were assisted by a great man, Glen. He gave us multiple options for staying there and helped Dan look into potentially 'bouncing' a package. Since we were so late and the town so small, our lodging options were few and pricy. The idea of visiting D.C popped into our heads again but we had now missed the train (literally). So what happens? Glen offers us and another couple a ride to D.C, no problem. We are then booking a hotel (which was cheaper than the one in Harpers Ferry) and in a car, on our way to the city. Glen was kind enough not only to bring us to the city but to our hotel as well, with many recommendations and anecdotes along the way. The time in the car flew by with great conversations! We then spent the night with a real shower, Chinese food and, movies.The next day we started with our complimentary breakfast and then took the city by storm (Dan took the breakfast by storm too!). We started with the White House, the National Archives to see the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, the Air & Space Museum, the National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Lincoln Memorial and the Jefferson memorial. Putting our fancy hiking legs to work! It was very useful when dodging around tourists We had a great day off, even though it meant walking just as much as a normal one. It was a nice change of pace to play tourist for a day. Hopped a late train back to Harpers Ferry and we were back at it again. To head back to the wilderness with our backpacks, thinking that just a day before we touched a moon rock, saw the Wright Flyer, gazed upon Leonardo Davinci's and Raphael's works, stood before Lincoln and our country's founding documents... Was quite surreal!","Harpers Ferry

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542960,"After our return from the whirlwind D.C. Tour, seeing our nations Capitol, we hit the trail again, making good time each day. Leaving Harpers Ferry, the symbolic halfway point behind us, now in the archives as attempted through-hikers. We reached the real halfway point, updated for 2016, marking 1094.55 miles on our journey. While holding hands we walked passed it together, as if it we were stepping through some magic threshold in a sci-fi movie. We sat down and ate a snack and stared at the lack luster sign. About 5 miles later we hit a much more epic sign, set up for a previous years' half way point, which was much more picture worthy. We wandered a few miles further, to Pine Grove Furnace General Store. A small convenience store that tradition mandates a hiker commemorate the half way point by attempting to eat a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting. Becky and I have never tested our frozen dairy boundaries, but with our appetites we had no trouble at all! I had trouble talking myself out of another half gallon to celebrate our half gallon victories! With the deceptive packaging of the ice cream industry, the half gallon cartons are actually 1.5 quarts now, which required us to each buy an extra pint to be at a true 1/2 gallon each. Becky's flavor selection was chocolate vanilla with caramel swirl, and peach, while I (foolishly) chose banana marshmallow swirl with vanilla wafers, and blueberry cheesecake. I don't know what I was thinking. My ice cream was the banana flavored cousin of 'cookies and cream' which is my least favorite ice cream flavor! But as the old Latin proverb says,'ice cream is ice cream!' Or something to that affect! We both signed the register joining the 'Half Gallon Club' received our mini wooden spoons as our prize to prove we were willing to consume $20 worth of ice cream in one sitting and continue hiking. A short distance later we passed a public swimming area complete with showers that we took advantage of briefly. A great way to ring in the half way point, ice cream, swimming and a shower!","Harpers Ferry

Between family visits, toe surgery, poison ivy, broken phones, rough trails and long days, we haven't gotten to blogging as much as we would like. Our current location is Harriman State Park in New York, mile #1395!Pennsylvania proved to be as tough as they claimed! You never know with ""trail rumors"". We still laugh about the days where everyone said that Virginia was going to be flat. Must have taken a wrong path somewhere...    The PA rocks were challenging both physically and mentally. Our elevation maps would show a relatively flat and easy day...but the terrain would often be rock scrambles. It took much more time and energy than we could have guessed. And don't forget to throw a few technical rock climbs in there! A rock climber wouldn't dare these climbs without a safety line, but hikers will with over 40lbs on their back! We saw days of rain separated with high humidity so large slippery wet rocks never dried. Dan managed a fantastic fall, landing pack down, feet high in the air wedged between two large rocks, like a turtle on it's back, thankfully uninjured! We were forced to retire our footwear, wet leather against relentless sharp rocks finally did them in.    Another issue that has been plaguing the trail in these areas has been droughts. Many ""reliable"" water sources have come up dry, or as black stagnant sludge, covered in mosquito larvae! This has left us in some interesting situations at times Believe me, nothing makes you thirstier than not having anything to drink...except maybe 90+ temps  A huge thank you to those who are leaving jugs of water at road crossings! There has been many spots that would have been impossible without this random act of kindness!       Despite the recent difficulties, we are still having a blast with all of this. Everything is merely part of the adventure. When things are rough, we focus on things like, whirlwind visits with family in NY and most recently with the trail passing nearby, we were able to see our NJ family! We got to see Dave and Mary, and Elaine, Armand (thanks for sharing your photo albums with us!) and a huge thank you to Paul and Noreen for their wonderful hospitality and generosity! They picked us up, dropped off, played host to us, and showered us with a never ending barrage of food and ice cream while staying up with us until the wee hours sharing stories and photos including pictures of 3 family members standing on Katahdin! And come to find out they did this during their 33 Wedding anniversary! Happy Anniversary guys! We also relish the times of other simple pleasures, where we get to jump in a pond or lake to cool off, or share laughs with our trail family, (particularly Martha who, like Dan, sports a 50+ pound red pack earning the trail name 'Big Red') and the wonderful views of open wilderness we get to see. I am extremely grateful to be in this adventure and most especially to have someone to share it with who is beyond what I could ever ask for.Onward and upward!","

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546076,"In our simple course of events we went through a town that had a gas station with a Duncan Donuts in it, just 1/4 mile off trail. When opportunities like this happen we dive on them! We sat down with our friend Martha and ordered a shameful amount of donuts, and 2 large iced coffees. It's been way too hot and the humidity has been terrible. We find it nearly impossible to stay hydrated or cool each day, so pounding any iced beverage sounded amazing. Becky and I noticed some towering thunderheads in the extreme distance, and checked the weather, ""severe thunderstorm warning"" we checked the hourly and it said 15% chance of rain until 10 pm and 40% at 11... So Becky, Martha and I sat there resting up over cold beverages and tasty sugar loaded pastries... After a blink of an eye, 2 hours had passed and we decided we should move on. With 5 miles left to our target shelter, our ETA was 10 pm. We started up out of town, around 8:30 with 3 miles left to go, we heard fireworks in the town below. It was our hope that we could find a clearing to watch them from the mountain side, but as no clearing presented itself we listened to them instead. When the fireworks stopped, we heard some deep rumbles of thunder from ahead of us. They increased quickly in quantity and volume until it seemed rather imminent that we were in for something soon. I had cell reception so I pulled the weather radar map and it was something out of a movie... The time lapse map showed a magenta colored wall moving from the west about to cover us... Only magenta, no green yellow or red... We decided to put our pack covers on in preparation and seconds later it hit. We heard: plip, plip, plip, and then the sound of a waterfall came from our left. Seconds later it was as if a fire hose was turned on us. I told Becky and Martha to stay close together and keep an eye out for any rock outcrops we could seek shelter in, useless words since we couldn't even see the trail. Through the torrential downpour and immense lightning, I led the way, following the river that used to be a trail, now a flash flooded 6 inch deep river running down the steep mountainside. Wiping my eyes constantly to try to look for white blazes, it was like walking through a strobe light, and my headlamp was mostly lighting up the rain alone. We were stranded on the side of Greylock Mountain, absolutely no options but to continue. The entire mountain shook with the lightning and thunder. The whitish blue light from the lightning flashed relentlessly. With constant lightning and constant thunder it was impossible to count between the two for distance, instead it was obvious that it was right over us and we were right in the middle of it. Most of the bolts of lightning appeared as they always do, whitish blue while illuminating the forest, but some struck close, too close. These instead illuminated with an orange light. I was looking to my left when a bolt came right down, and to my blood curdling horror I saw the orange haze was from an aura of fire around the lightning bolt. The lightning itself was incased in flames, I can only assume from massive amounts of rain that it was vaporizing, and here we are slopping through 6 inch deep muddy water. I yelled to Becky and Martha, who where right next to me, to stay close, it will either fry all 3 of us or none of us. For the next hour we walked uphill through muddy water, sure that the next bolt would hit us, or a tree next to us as we stand in water. I'm not sure about the other two , but my prayers didn't stop for a moment, until we finally reached the shelter. We spilled in like 3 nearly drowned rats, stripped our wet layers and dumped a cup or more of water from each of our boots. I ran our food bags out to the bear box and then dried off and slipped into dry cloths. We climbed into our sleeping bags on the floor of the shelter. A floor, which would fetch complaints from most, was a blessing to us, dry and safe, the very answer to my fervent prayers. The next morning we continued the rest of the way up Graylock Mt., the highest peak in Massachusetts, and heard from a gentleman at the lodge that it was the worst storm that has been on that mountain in recent history, the lodge atop the mountain had been struck 3 times and the towers countless times. I've never seen a storm like that, I've never even seen a movie portray one like that, but we where in it. Vulnerable, and in true peril, we made it through together, to the safety and comfort of a dirty floor in a 3 sided shelter on the side of a mountain. Where the thunder seemed distant, and the sound of the rain steady outside, and once again Becky and I found true blessings easier to recognize than ever.","Harriman State Park

At this point I can say time still feels erratic, and less linear than ever... as if we have been out here only days, and years at the same time. We should be into New Hampshire and into the White Mountains within the week! My mom and Dad were kind enough to come out and exchange some of our gear in person last week, to avoid mailing a bunch of packages back and forth! We opted to do this before we get too far up the east coast. Our gear changes this time are mostly focused on the return of our cold weather gear since the evening temperatures are starting to cool and we'll soon be ascending to much higher elevations. We said good bye to our 1 lb sleeping bags and welcomed back our 3.5 lb down bags again! Going lighter we said good bye to our non-stick cooking pan, meaning a (slightly) simpler menu. We are swapping our MSR Hyperlite water filter for a Sawyer Squeeze, though I think I'll leave a separate blog for sharing my 5 months of water filtration experience. We sent home our never used rain ponchos, and brought on some frog togg rain/wind suits (since Mt.

Amongst our added weight was some of the world's best banana bread, courtesy of our friends Dave and Greg, and a batch of fresh chocolate chip cookies thanks to Becky's mom, Judy- thanks guys! We finished our swapping and then enjoyed a Chinese buffet, and visited with my parents.

We're excited to see all the beauty the Whites have to offer!     In the last couple days approaching the Whites, we experienced a great example of hospitality, kindness and generosity! We've seen many examples of kindness on this trail but I wanted to share this one.    We stealth camped at the peak of Mt. Cube, and in the morning descended to Governor Thomson Hwy. Martha was excited to watch some tv and enjoy a cold soda at a hostel located one mile before our target shelter, so she continued on to enjoy that, while Becky and I decided to hitch two miles west to see Mt. Cube Sugar Farm. Here we found a hand written note on the door that said ""hikers welcome, come in, I'll see you this evening. If you need anything call me at..."" Just a couple of minutes later, Peter Thomson showed up and took the time to give us a tour of his sugar farm, then asked if we wanted pancakes. He showed us to the kitchen where we found 2 bags of his family's cornmeal pancake mix, a gallon pitcher of syrup, eggs, milk and butter! We talked for a few minutes and he shared with us a tale from his youth, and showed a picture of when the first woman to ever through hike the AT, 'Grandma Gatewood', showed up at their door one evening on her famous hike. He then apologized that he had a delivery to make, that he'd be back later. He told us to make ourselves at home and help ourselves to anything we like. We made a stack of pancakes and enjoyed them with eggs and syrup.     We returned to the trail inspired by Peter's kindness, generosity, hospitality and his unparalleled trust. His store runs on the honor system. Who would have thought a place like this could still exist. What he did was worth so much more than pancakes and (amazing) syrup, he showed complete strangers into his business, left us there unattended with his livelihood and cared for us out of a true desire to help. The feelings instilled by this were truly indescribable!     An experience such as this sometimes shines focus on and exemplifies other, unkind experiences. One solid memory comes to mind. Rewind back in our hike to July 1st, at mile 1147, we passed through Duncanon PA. At the polar opposite end of the kindness spectrum proudly sits the Doyle Hotel.       Please brace yourselves for some negativity as I speak of the Doyle Hotel and its owners...     650 miles later, I'm still hearing fresh stories of hiker's bad experiences at the Doyle. Without tainting our blog with a seemingly endless list of dirty details, and endless tales of how bad the rooms were and how bad the owners treated them... I personally was yelled at as though I was a misbehaving child, for holding a coffee when I came into their business. Becky was cornered by the owner to close a tab she never had, the owners yelled at our friend for walking near the pool table, another friend was yelled at for switching their stool for one that wasn't missing it's cushion, the list went on and on until I happily left their business. Rudeness was their first order of business, and to their paying clientele none the less. It's refreshing i don't see people like the Doyle owners often, it was a terrible display of peoples' worst qualities. A fair warning to future hikers (and anyone else passing through) to think twice before offering patronage to such a business where they could miss the target on something as simple as decency!    Anyway enough of that. Well done Peter, simple kindness and trust, so eloquently displayed! God Bless! We'll continue deep into the Whites tomorrow and almost certainly be in radio silence for the next week or so, wish us luck! Enjoy the pictures!","

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548549,"We survived the White Mountains and at mile 1908, just crossed the border into Maine! With thirteen states behind us and on our last one! The weather through the white mountains was exceptional. Aside from a little fog, we were blessed with clear days and breath-taking views. We had concerns about what the weather could be, but it was perfect for us. We also had concerns about the AMC's charging for everything in the whites, but that too wasn't bad. We had heard horror stories from other hikers, about how the Appalachian Mountain Club charges everyone $10 a person per night for shelters and campsites, and nails you $125 per person for huts. As we traveled through, we got a much better feeling than what other hikers described. The unintentional consequences of charging long distance through hikers, is that we will find or make stealth campsites. If the AMC would make a through hiker's permit, charge us once and allow free use of shelters and campsites they could avoid stealth sites and not interfere with revenue generated from day-hikers and short section hikers. Aside from that note Becky and I found beautiful stealth sights, almost always with a view of the sunset and sunrise. Martha met up with a couple of her old Coast Guard friends and hiked with them for 3 days through the whites. Becky and I met back up with her by Pinkham Notch, in the mean time some of our favorite stealth sites were in the whites... Truly memorable sites on the edge of cliffs and overlooking the vast wilderness.     As for the AMC huts, Becky and I understand them completely now. They cost as much as they do, because they are set up like an old fashioned cabin hotel, geared towards short section hikers who want (and often require) more luxuries to help them see the wilderness of the White Mountains. The huts provide their guests with dinner and breakfast, served family style. To accomplish this, the hut's crew must hike in (and out) tons of supplies. The rest of the the supplies are airlifted in by helicopter. We stopped in to nearly every hut on our way through. They were fantastic! Becky and I would look through the old logs, hopping to find an entry from her grandfather. We'd get accurate weather reports for the peaks and the valleys, fill our water, we would also ask for leftovers, and leftovers we received!!! We had pancakes, eggs, rice & vegetable medley, oatmeal, and chicken Parmesan, often in large quantities! The friendly crews were happy to provide it so they wouldn't have to hike it out.     We were able to see a helicopter supply drop first hand. We hear the AMC pays $1600/ hour for this service. We sat in the 'Lonesome Lake Hut' eating a huge platter of pancakes, as we heard the helicopter coming in. I decided to take a video as it approached with a large load of 6x6 pressure treated lumber. We watched as the pilot slammed the lumber through the trees and set it right on our packs. The ground crew had it lifted off and moved to the proper spot as we sat there filming, with nothing to do but laugh. What are the astronomical odds!? We have been cautious of countless bears, shelter mice, raccoons, weather and terrain, but never did we look out for this, a helicopter missing its cargo drop spot and crushing our gear under a 1000lb load of lumber. Our gear survived quite well, all things considered.    So now we continue through southern Maine with 281 miles left to go! We have tons of pictures to load, but that will have to wait until our cell reception isn't so sketchy!","Lincoln, NH

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549735,"We have absolutely loved Northern New Hampshire and Maine! The views are amongst the best the trail has to offer, we feel as if they have been building in grandeur to this point! The weather has thankfully been clear for most of the epic peaks, with 100+ mile visibility. Those that were obscured, hid us in a beautiful rolling fog, a place where you see only feet around you, easily perceived as a land described only in cold stories of the past where the rich or foolish would be led by a Sherpa.       We enjoyed the Mahoosuc Notch, but underestimated the time needed to complete it. It is called ""the most difficult mile"" or ""the most fun mile"" of the entire AT... Our reviews are mixed, but we did enjoy it! We allotted about 2 hours for it and it took us 3. The first 2 hours were adventurous, climbing under, over and through huge rocks, challenging and unforgiving... The last hour was the worst night hike of our lives, treacherous and dangerous, frustrating and slippery. We stumbled out, into a campsite and spent the evening talking about unnecessary risks.       Some of the noteworthy views lately that come to mind were from Saddleback, the Bigelows, and Moxie Pond Mountain, well, pretty much every peak we climb!       We received our last food drop box in Caratunk, at the Northern Outdoors. There, we sorted out food by the fireplace, and enjoyed a foot high cheeseburger called 'the exterminator' which had: two 1 lb patties of beef, cheese, fried pickles, a beer battered fried chicken breast, battered and fried mac n' cheese, onion rings, bacon, and barbecue sauce on 3 buns surrounded by spiced potato wedges... One of the best burgers I've had in my life!     We made our way north to Monson ME, and decided to grab a few last minute staples, and a fantastic breakfast from Pete's Place. After that we hitched back to the trailhead and into 'the 100 mile wilderness', a section famous for its lack of resupply. The last few nights have flirted with freezing temperatures at times, making for some cold nights and added responsibilities, such as keeping our water filter warm day and night. Hopefully the slight warm up we heard rumor of happens!       Our AT&T cell reception has been quite weak lately so additional blogposts and pictures will have to wait for now, but trust me we have a ton of photos to be posted! Now at mile 2077.6, with 111.5 left to summit, hopefully on October 5th or so! Wish us luck!","

Fat Hen (Dano) and Talon (Becky),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550685,"Well here we are, at Katadin Stream Camp, just 5 miles below Mt. Katadin's peak. In no way can I describe what this journey has been or what this journey has done to us. We've heard from former through hikers that if you can walk 2200 miles to complete this journey, it will change you. It most certainly does.    Tomorrow is October 5th, exactly 200 days since Becky and I began the Appalachian Trail, and 202 days since we began the Amicalola Approach Trail. We've spent more than half a year covering over 2200 miles by walking, hiking and rock climbing through the wilderness. We've moved every single step together.    Tomorrow, the summit of Mt. Katahdin marks the end of a journey together, it also will mark the beginning of a new journey.     Sewn deep in a pocket of my pack, behind a scrap of fabric I have carried a ring every step of this journey. The ring I've carried is for her. I made this ring myself, as a true symbol of my love, and ensuring it is the only one of its kind. Cast of silver, simple, with a gemstone of Painite. Becky loves silver, and loves simplicity, as for the stone... well that was my choice for a number of reasons.       Painite is nearly entirely unheard of, unrecognizable to nearly everyone. The color is dark and complex, shifting from amber to blood red depending on the lighting. Painite is the rarest gemstone on the planet. Becky's the rarest girl on the planet. I'd go anywhere with her, do anything with her and do anything for her. With a ring that I made for her, and carried 2200 miles, I'll ask for her hand in marriage.      Tomorrow atop the highest point In Maine, we'll complete this journey just as we started it, together with one step.","Mt.

It will take a couple days for us to sort through, and upload, but we have countless pictures to add and a couple more blogs to put up.    For you statistics and number crunchers out there, I have a real gift! We have kept extremely detailed records of our daily mileage. I'll add all of our numbers to this blog! Grab a 2016 Northbound addition of David ""AWOL"" Miller's book 'The A.T. Guide', and you'll be able to follow our progress for every single day of the hike! We have kept numbers for everything, including days off, etc!     Our hike didn't skip an inch. We walked every single step, northbound, from Amicalola GA to the summit of Mt. Katahdin in ME.... with absolutely NO 'yellow blazing' (taking a shuttle to skip hard or 'boring' parts) and no 'reverse slack packing' (leaving all you gear at a hostel and getting a ride north to walk difficult sections easier in reverse... to better explain: a ride to the top of a challenging climb so you can walk down hill without any of your gear). Everyone who hikes this trail does so for their own reasons and in their own way, but for Becky and I, it was important not to rely on tricks and gimmicks or shortcuts, but to tackle this honestly, together.    We did it! Watch for the rest of our blogs (We have some that couldn't be added due to reception-less days, we'll add them to the date when we wrote them so watch out, the date stamps might hide them back in the shuffle) and tons of pictures, all of our numbers and a brief reviews of gear that worked and gear that didn't!","
