BeechNut,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/442989,"Had a beautiful hike today in Shenandoah National Park. It was a nice, cold, and sunny morning. The trail was covered with snow, over a foot in some places. It made for an interesting hike. Several icy spots tested my balance. The views were totally spectacular! Lots of birds and deer to watch. Overall, had an awesome day! Hopeful that tomorrow will be just as nice. Happy trails!",,Beautiful day to hike! ,"Feb 22, Sat",0
