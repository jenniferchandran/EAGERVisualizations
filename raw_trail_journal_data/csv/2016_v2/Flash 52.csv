Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520907,"By age 54 I should know better than to get foolishly injured. Two years before starting my AT hike I had ignored my wife’s concerns about dirt bike racing and shattered my hip, damaging the nerves in my leg in the process. After sitting on my butt for two years waiting to get better, I decide to take matters into my own hands.I was inspired by the movie “Wild” and by reading Awol’s hiking the AT book. I announced that I was going to “Hike the Appalachian Trail” to various family members and others who didn’t believe I’d really do this. I also had my own doubts after discovering during a pre-hike that I could only go about a mile (and this was on flat ground…) before I had to call my wife to come get me with the car. Despite all this, after several weeks of research and frantic preparation, I finally started my hike North from Springer Mountain on March 3, 2015 which was two years from the date I had injured my hip and leg. As I began my hike I went through all the concerns my family had been sharing with me along with a variety of my own fears. “What happens if something goes wrong?”“I’ll be fine!” I had insisted. Although I had never hiked before, I stubbornly told myself “I’m going to do this no matter what” as I hiked a whopping 2.6 miles my first day. It was several weeks and 63 miles later that the real excitement began. I pushed harder than usual and didn’t drink enough water that day arriving at Deep Gap Shelter late in the day. A dozen or more hikers were cooking dinner and talking trail smack. I joined in with a small group and was invited to partake in what some hikers call a “Staff Meeting”. Unless the trail had taken us into Colorado, this uh, “activity” wasn’t legally authorized so I’ll let you use your imagination to figure out what happens in a staff meeting. “So what if I hadn’t done this in over 30 years… what the heck”, I thought, “I’m on the AT.” Within a few minutes of this activity my vision started to spin so I sat down on a nearby bench that was built into the side of the shelter. The next thing I knew I was lying on the ground with people yelling and running over to me. I had passed out and clunked over onto the hard ground. “Are you ok?”“You had a seizure!” I heard a distinct male voice call out.“Ask him what date it is.” “Umm… March 20th?” I guessed. The gal looking at me scrunching up her face. “No, it’s March 19.” I corrected. “He doesn’t know what day it is!”“See if he can walk”, a short haired hiker who seemed to take command suggested. I was yanked up to my feet and took a few wobbly steps before the “Commander” (my name for him) shouted out “He can’t walk, I’m calling 911!” “Maybe we should wait a bit before calling”, I meekly suggested. “Nope, you sit right there! You’ve obviously got a concussion and I’m calling for rescue right now.” replied The Commander. He had mentioned he had PTSD and it seemed that my little fall had triggered something for him. At this point I was a bit concerned - mainly because I’d never had a seizure of any type before. The Commander was telling everyone that they would likely helicopter me out due to the remote location, 3.5 miles up the narrow trail from Dick’s Creek Gap. I couldn’t get a signal on my cell phone so I asked if someone - anyone - could please call my wife for me. The Commander was the only one who responded saying “What’s her number?” I provided our home number but there was no answer. I then gave him my wife’s cell, helpfully saying “I think that’s right, if not try the same number ending in 9025 instead of 9925.” “He can’t keep his numbers straight!” exclaimed the Commander as he made the call and connected with my wife. “He’s had a serious fall and had a seizure. Yes, that’s right, a seizure. He’s got a concussion and we’ve called 911. They’re on the way to rescue him right now.” I knew my wife and kids would be pretty worried and I was wondering how I’d explain this little mishap to them. After all, I WAS pretty dehydrated… I contemplated, “Maybe I’ll leave that part about the staff meeting out…”“We think he was dehydrated AND there’s another piece to it that it’s not my place to get into.” Said the Commander, still on the phone with my wife. “It’s not my place to explain that, I’ll leave that up to HIM to tell you about or not.”Ok… I guess I am going to tell my wife the whole story here. Thanks Mr. Commander for helping me make that decision : ) I listened in from the shelter’s porch to the campfire chatter as other hikers joined the group and and were updated.“Oh, he’s definitely got a concussion.”“He can’t keep his numbers straight.”“He doesn’t even know what day it is.”After an hour or so I was feeling much better and suggested that I perhaps I should get up and walk around a bit to see how I felt.“You are going to stay RIGHT THERE until you can be evaluated!” responded the Commander. “Then, and ONLY THEN, can you get up.”“Uh, ok, yes sir”, I thought, inwardly smiling about the hilarity of the whole situation. 45 minutes later multiple headlamps sprouted out from the woods as fifteen medics arrived for the rescue. They had come up a nearby forest service road on ATVs, bringing along an ambulance, and full size 4x4 truck. The lead medic was friendly and helpful, asking me various questions and having me do a few tests like walking around and touching my finger to my nose. “I think you’re fine.” he said. “I’ll take you down the mountain if you insist but I don’t see any signs of a concussion and I think you’re ok.”He went on to add, “I tend to be overly careful and get in trouble sometimes for taking people in who don’t need our help, so while there’s no guarantee of course, I think you’re ok.”So I spent the night in the shelter after the other hikers were nice enough to make a spot to squeeze me in. The next morning I got up early and tried to make my way down the trail in the fog without attracting any more attention. “So you’re Flash 52… ha ha ha ha.” I heard again and again the following week. “I’ve heard all about you!”My wife and kids were initially rattled by my experience but laughed heartily once I told them the whole story as I’ve shared with you here. Here’s what I learned from all this…“If you’re going to hike the AT, don’t forget to pack your common sense”This is my first post here. I did continue hiking further North and will fill you in with further posts on what happened including how hiking with my disability has helped to define my version of “Hike Your Own Hike.”","Tray Mt Shelter

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520953,"Hi There.. and thanks for checking out my Journal!Here's how I ended up doing a restart:I hiked the AT for 318 miles last spring from Springer Mt to Sam’s Gap which is near Erwin, TN. I had norovirus and was dealing with complications from my leg injury so I went home to recover. After taking the summer off, I section hiked another 185 miles in Northern VA and MD in the fall and winter.Today is the day that I re-start my Thru-Hike at Sam’s Gap. I arrived in Erwin, TN last night at 10:30 pm after driving 8 hours from Maryland. I stayed at Uncle Johnny’s Hostel which is right on the trail where I expect my hike to take me to over the next 3 days. I’m obviously pretty excited to be getting “back on the trail” but the biggest thing I felt was the massive difference between the lack of energy I had when I quit last year and how I’m feeling now. I was pretty worn down mentally and physically and I’m doing a few things differently this year to avoid falling into that same trap.One big thing, for me, is that I’ve had another 10 months for the nerve damage to continue healing in my leg and foot. If you didn’t know it yet, I was in a dirt bike racing accident about 3 years ago. Four months ago I began a hike prep weight loss and training program. After an hour of daily elliptical machine at the gym, swimming twice a week, 30 minutes a day of physical therapy exercises, and of course eating super healthy - I’ve lost 30 pounds. That's more than my pack weighs! The result of this is now I don’t get out of breath as easily and my leg doesn’t bother as much as it used to. Leaving Sam’s Gap going up the hill I noticed I have SO MUCH more energy compared to when I stopped hiking last May.Today was a nice easy day so I took my time. In May the leaves were on the trees but now I’m able to see off the ridge through the trees. This is one of the upsides to winter hiking. I arrived on top of Big Bald without running into any snow. The views were awesome and I considered tenting on Big Bald for the night but the cold wind knocked some sense into my head and I made my way down to Bald Mountain Shelter. At the shelter, I met Slipknot, a NOBO who started Jan 8th at Springer Mountain. We made a fire and shared stories while we dried our socks and warmed our feet. Turns out we’re both retired and have kids about the same ages. Slipknot has experience with winter hiking so I learned a number of things from him including how to stay warm at night. Turns out this is the coldest night I’ve been out on the trail, supposed to be about 12 degrees… Brrrr… I’ll make a video and post it to my YouTube channel to show you the ideas I’m using to keep warm if you’re interested. So for my first day back on the trail - I’m happy, mostly warm, and in a nice shelter.","Sam's Gap

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520954,"Whoo.. Hoooo… It was COLD last night. The water bottles were frozen solid and I moved fast once I was out of my sleeping bag. I’m glad I have my winter bag with me. Slipknot has a pair of down slippers he uses and I wished I had a pair last night! I noticed that some of my leg muscles were sore this morning despite my pre-hike training program. I’m looking forward to getting in even better shape by actually hiking. I hiked for the first 3 hours in ALL my gear including my raincoat, rainpants, hat, neck warmer, gloves and a light pair of over mittens. The blustery wind kept me busy warming my fingers during the morning. I’ve got a pair of lobster mittens in the car that I’m going to add to my arsenal when I get to Erwin. I listened to an audio book called “What about the boy”, a story about a family who works hard to assist in the physical and mental development of their son who suffered some brain damage at birth. It’s an interesting story and like other stories about challenges or facing hardships, it’s motivating to me as I limp my way along the trail today. I arrived at No Business Knob Shelter and found Slipknot sitting on the picnic table eating his mountain house meal for dinner. I made a meal of lentils which I enjoy. Plain lentils sound pretty boring but I like a simple meal at the end of the day. We took turns trying to start a fire but the wood was a little wet so we gave up and hit the sack early due to the cold weather. While laying in my sleeping bag waiting for my feet to warm up I decided to order some down slippers like the ones that Slipknot has. Then I remembered my father had said to make sure and look at the stars at night. So I got back up, dug my glasses out of my pack and gazed at the stars until the cold encouraged me to get back into my sleeping bag. Life is good - I’m content, warm (except my feet), and in a nice shelter.","Bald Mountain Shelter

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521015,"I got up this morning when Slipknot started moving around at 6:30 am.I skipped my nightly hot chocolate last night and had an easier night. For some reason this cold weather makes me need to get up at night numerous times. I only had to get up twice to relieve myself - Now I need to make sure I drink extra water this morning. Speaking of which, I heated up some water to put in my Nalgene to make a hot water bottle for my sleeping bag last night. It worked great - warmed my feet right up. Now I'm too low on water and the stream is .2 miles South of here. Looking at Awol's guide I don't see any water between here and Erwin, which is today's destination. I'm going to chance it.. this time of year there are small streams that don't show up in the guidebook. Worse case, it's a short day and I can make it with what I have on hand. There were a few small hills and then it was all downhill into Erwin. I DID find a small trickle of a stream and stopped to get a bit more water for the day. I also stopped to enjoy the nice views of the Nolichucky River from up on the ridge right before the trail headed downhill for the last mile into Erwin. This was a beautiful day, easy hike, less than 6 miles, so I took my time and tried to soak up everything. I try to remind myself during this journey that this is the only time I’m likely to pass this way, so I need to appreciate and enjoy everything I see and all the people I meet. Sometimes on longer days I find myself thinking mostly about how far I’ve hiked and how many more miles to get to the next shelter or where ever I’m headed. I didn’t make that mistake today. Slipknot and I went to dinner at the Italian place that’s near the Walmart. There’s a big storm headed in to the area tomorrow so we’ve been checking all the different AT weather sites. I’m setting down now at the Super 8 motel. Slipknot was nice enough to split his room with me. Life is very good right now. I’m happy to have met Slipknot, I’m just the right amount of tired, I’m warm, and in an OK motel.","No Business Knob Shelter

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521016,"I slept great last night but Slipknot said he was up most of the night. Maybe I was snoring or something.. ?Anyway, we went to McDonalds for breakfast. This is a rest day and we’re expecting a big storm to come in later today. I don’t like the term “Zero Day”. I don’t really know why… maybe because mean people say things like “You’re such a zero”. Oh well.. I’m resting today instead of zeroing. I decide to bring my car along with me this year to make ""off the trail"" stuff easier. I can store extra food and supplies in it and it’s pretty useful on a day like today. After going to McDonalds we drove around to find a laundromat so I could clean my stinky hiker clothes. While waiting for the dryer to finish I searched on my iPhone for a different (better) place to stay. The Super 8 is ok decent. It’s just that last year when I got the big norovirus thing I ended up at the same Super 8 for four or five days… just laying around hoping I’d feel better. It doesn’t seem to bring back any pleasant memories for me. I looked on AirBnb and found what looks to be a small hostel that’s near Indian Grave Gap which is the next road crossing on the trail. It’s called Poplar Creek Farm and Hostel. (Turns out it’s also in Awol’s book) They gave me directions to get there, just drive East into the mountains for about 15 or 20 miles. So now it’s starting to snow and I’m finally heading into the hills to find this hostel. I’m a bit worried about driving in the snow but figure if I can make it up there. Based on the AirBnB photos it’ll be a nice place to wait out the snow storm thats supposed to blow for the next two days. I’m about a mile from the hostel when my car decides it’s had enough of this white stuff and it refuses to go any further up the hill. Tires are spinning and I’m going backwards.. you know the drill. Just then I see another car driving toward me that stops and does a 3 point turn to go in the same direction as me. “Are you looking for the B & B?” says Mike, the hostel owner who apparently came out looking for me.“Yes, B & B, hostel, whatever… I just want to get in out of this cold blowing snow storm. I then explained that I didn’t think my car was going anywhere - perhaps I should just leave it by the side of the road.“Let me give it a try.” He suggested. “I don’t know if I can do any better than you, but maybe I can.” Somehow he expertly guided the car up the hill using some finesse with the gas pedal instead of just jamming it to the floor like I was doing. He also found and pressed some sort of magic “traction” button that I was clueless about. Maybe I can read my owners manual to pass the time at the hostel. So with Mike’s help I made it here - and it’s SO NICE. Turns out I’m the only one here so I have the run of the place. There’s a big living room with a wood stove, an outfitted kitchen, a big bathroom, and my own room with a snug looking queen bed. I forgot to mention that I stopped at the Food Lion to stock up with a few days of food to cook. (That’s the one downside to this hostel, it’s not near town). I am safe, warm, and inside a warm hostel while the snow is piling up out the window. Life is good.","Erwin, TN

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521020,"I've been having a good time waiting out the storm here at Poplar Creek Farm and Hostel. Last year I made my decision to hike the AT and left for Springer Mountain about a month later. That didn't leave much time to get in shape or train for the trail. With my restart this year I've had the advantage of knowing that I would be thru hiking again and thus time to physically prepare. October 6th of last year I got a food journal and started writing down everything I ate. I also set a goal to lose 30 pounds - VERY SLOWLY - about 1 pound per week. At this point I'm just shy of making it and figure the uphills on the trail will help me lose the last few pounds : ) My biggest issue is my friggin leg. Nerve damage. It'll be three years as of March 3rd from the date of my accident. (Doesn't ""Incident"" sound more intriguing...) The problem is number one that it hurts most of the time, and number two, nerves regenerate VERY SLOWLY. The good news is that hiking helps strengthen my leg (and my wobbly foot) while giving me something else to focus on besides how much my foot is bothering me. The sound of the quiet forest covered in snow, the beauty of the wilderness, wondering all afternoon how far it is to the next shelter... all of this is WAY better than sitting at home watching Netflix with my leg on a heating pad.I had to accept that my leg wasn't going to be all better in time for my restart so I decided to just do what I could each day to help my healing process along. Here's what I've been doing for the past four months:- Section hiking for 2 to 4 days at a time on the AT close to MD which is where I live. I drove as far as 3 hours away to do this and section hiked a total of 185 miles.- Walked my dog, ""Snickers"" 1/2 mile at least twice a day (but not when I was hiking)- Elliptical type machine at 24 hr fitness for 1 hr per day (Precor 100i - I call it an air runner, no impact)- Various leg stretches, mostly on my injured side- Calf stretches, 2 minutes, 10 times a day on my injured leg- 30 minutes of physical therapy exercise per day to strengthen my hipOther than the hiking doing all this can get to be a little dull so I also joined a masters swim class - twice a week - to spice things up a bit. I'm the slowest one there but I don't care because swimming is a good no impact exercise that helps my injured leg AND helps build cardio for HIKING.. !The coach is funny and encouraging - She's actually helped me enough where I started enjoying the swimming. I had told her I was heading back to the AT which brings me back to today's photo. I thought it would be funny to take a ""Hiking in my swimming gear"" photo and send it to her. She thought it was hilarious. Thanks so much for tuning in to my Journal. I'm planning on including other stuff besides ""I hiked x miles today"" - most of which will be related to hiking in some fashion even if the connection is a rather small thread at times. Please sign my guest book and send me any suggestions, encouragement, or things you'd like me to write about or explore. I promise to do my best to respond to everything you send to me once I get connected to a decent wifi : )","Poplar Creek Farm and Hostel

This is the actual stuff I'm using on the trail right now to keep me mostly warm at night and happily hiking. Maybe you can get some ideas from what I show you or perhaps even tell me where I can improve or cut weight further. Actually I'll let you know in a later Journal when the video is ready for you. Maybe I should just put it up and not worry about editing it perfect or including all the specs in the notes.... hmmm.. that sounds like a good idea, but not tonight.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521026,"I ended up getting a late start today because I was finishing up my “Light Weight 2016 Thru-Hiker Winter Gear” video. It’s almost, but not quite done : ) The hostel owner drove me down the icy roads and up to Indian Grave Gap to start my first day hiking in deep snow AND my first time going in SOBO direction. I’ve done everything NOBO so far but getting rides today was much easier if I started close to the hostel and hiked SOBO into Erwin. By the time we get to the trail it’s almost 10 am and you can see by looking at today’s photo the 6 to 8 inches of snow that was waiting for me. I was hoping that another hiker had made tracks for me to follow because I’ve heard stories about hikers who can’t find the trail or worse, get lost off the trail in the winter snow. OK… no tracks.. I’ll just make sure I take my time and double check to make sure I’m seeing white blazes fairly often. I’m trying out two different types of snow cleats today. - Kahtoola - has 10 carbide tips that look like they might work better on ice than on snow and..- Stabilicers - these look like a thin hiking boot sole with big plastic cleats AND ice screws. They attach with velcro straps. Slipknot turned me on to the Stabilicers - he swears by them and says they work best for deep uphill snow by keeping your foot from sliding back. It’s cold so I start out with all of my various coats, hats, and gear on. As the morning warms up I take off a few things and notice there’s a wonderful quietness hiking through the snow. It’s a lack of sounds that must be somehow soaked up by all the snow. Nice.I started off with the Kahtoola’s on my boots and they seem to be working ok. I slip and fall at one point but get up and brush off the snow without hurting myself. The deep snow is hard at times going up the slight hills I’m climbing. I find that downhills are surprisingly EASIER (for me at least) than the dry trail. I don’t have to worry quite as much about where I place my injured foot since each step is cushioned by the snowpack. I stop at Curly Maple Gap Shelter to eat a protein bar for lunch, borrow the Tennessee portable privy shovel, and while I’m at it, I swap out my snow cleats to try the bigger, bulkier Stabilicers.Wow… ! These things really grip well. They are a bit clunky to wear but they work better than the Kahtoola’s in the deep snow. The problem I’ve having is that the snow is getting thinner as the elevation drops down towards Erwin. After just 45 minutes or so I’m on 2 to 4 inches of snow instead of the 6 to 8 inches that was higher up on the mountain. Then the rocks and dirt of the trail start to show through. The Stabilicers at this point work TOO GOOD. In the deep snow I was stepping down, packing the snow down to stand on flat packed snow with rocks underneath. Now that that snow is much thinner, the Stabilizers grip the edges of partially covered rocks on one side while the other side clunks down suddenly without warning twisting my ankle from the unexpected movement. In all fairness, this is an issue only for me or any other hikers with a similar “wobbly foot” that is caused by something like my injury. I can move my foot - a little. I have a bit of strength in my foot - a little. I just can’t react to sudden vectors without it triggering a minor sprain each time. So the Stabilizers come off, the Kahtoola’s go back on. Then in another hour the trail is showing mostly through the snow and I go back to just my hiking boots. Moral for today(besides start earlier is almost always a good idea  Depending on snow depth I’m going to use both types of cleats. The Kahtoola’s keep me from slipping on ice or light snow and the Stabilicers would be very helpful on steeper uphills and in snow that is 6 inches or deeper. A special thanks to Slipknot for suggesting the Stabilicers. I had REI send them overnight here once I knew the big storm was coming.Speaking of which, I got to hang out with Slipknot again. The hostel owner let me borrow her car to go have one last dinner with him. He’s shuttling ahead past Roan Mountain tomorrow to bypass the deep snow - moving to a point on the trail that’s all at 3,000 feet or lower in elevation. Then he’ll return later to fill in the part he’s bypassing. If you aren’t following Slipknot’s Journal you may want to check it out here. Just put the website name followed by /slipknot Or I think you can search for Slipknot.Wow… feels like it’s been a long day. Tomorrow I’m taking a bus home so I can be home for our anniversary. 21 amazing, wonderful years. Then it’s another bus to take me back here to the trail on the 17th. I’ll post some short updates while I’m gone so that you know what’s going on.Thanks so much for reading and encouraging me, even if it’s just in your head. “That crazy Flash 52 is limping his way to Maine..

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521190,"It’s supposed to get even colder this weekend so today I’m leaving the Poplar Creek Farm and Hostel to take a few days off from hiking. I’m going to take the bus home tonight from Johnson City so I can celebrate our 22nd wedding anniversary. I thought it was just 21 years, but my wife reads this journal and reminded me that it’s been 22 years. No matter how long, it’s been a wonderful and amazing time : ) More snow is drifting down as I pack my stuff into my Honda Accord. After 3 tries I finally make it up the snowy driveway and wind my way Westward out of the Tennessee mountains. I gave the AT a wave as I went by knowing that I’d soon return to Indian Grave Gap to resume my hike. I stopped for lunch in Johnson City at Ole’s Guacamoles and had a delicious molcajete stone bowl full of chicken, steak, hot peppers, beans and various spices floating around. My bus doesn’t leave until 9:30 tonight so I fill the afternoon by searching AirBnB and Craigslist for a reasonably priced place for me to stay over the next month or so during my “Zero” days when I’m off the trail resting up. The name zero comes from the fact that you are hiking zero miles anytime you take a break from hiking up the trail.Last Spring I stayed where most hikers do, right close to the AT in either a hostel or a “Hiker Motel”. Most of the time my decision on where to stay was based what was closest to the AT or who perhaps offered a free shuttle to and from the trail. This year I have my car nearby. I usually park it along the AT at the location I plan to reach by hiking another 3 or 4 days. Then I hire one of the AT shuttle services that are shown in Awol’s guide to take me back to my starting point further South so that I can resume hiking where finished a few days before. This isn’t the most environmentally friendly method of hiking, and that bothers me some. However, to make the AT experience work for me and to make it easier with my injured leg, this is how I’ve decided to do it. This allows me to have my own ride waiting for me (as long as I don’t lose the key… heh,heh,heh..) and head into town to get food, resupply, and choose where I would like to zero for a day or two. I thought of renting a room somewhere, perhaps in a house, where I could keep my extra supplies and return to one central location over the next month or so. This would remove the uncertainty of WHERE I would stay and also help make sure that I had a clean and quiet place to rest up as I zero. I will tell you that so far I’ve stayed in some really nice hostels/motels and also zeroed in some that are not so nice…. Kinda cruddy actually. I realize as I’m making calls and emailing people that it may be hard to find someone who’s ok with an AT hiker who’s only willing to commit to a 30 day lease. So after contacting 10 or 15 possible places, including driving most of the way to one that changed their mind about accepting a 30 day tenant, I discovered a really nice furnished basement room for $400/month on Holston Lake. This one was near mile 450 on the AT, and about an hours drive from where I’m hiking now. The plan is to hike from Erwin up the AT past Damascus and be able to get “home” when I take a zero day within an hour or less. This does involve more driving compared to staying right along the trail, but it’s part of my “Hike Your Own Hike”. I left my car up on the road and walked down the winding snow covered driveway. I didn’t want to get stuck again. I met with the owner who lives in the immaculately kept main floor of the house. He seemed a little unsure about taking an unknown hiker into his house, but after we got to know each other better he warmed up to providing a place for me. I wrote him a check and let him know that I’d be back Wednesday night after taking the bus to Washington DC and back for our anniversary. As I was about to leave in my car I realized that I could probably store my hiking gear and the piano keyboard I’d brought from home in my new basement room rather than leaving it exposed to possible theft in my car parked at the Johnson City bus station. A quick call to the owner confirmed that this would be fine. I grabbed the big Hefty bag full of all my pack contents in one arm and hoisted the rather heavy full sized piano keyboard under the other arm. I made my way down the now darkened driveway in small steps due to the steep hill, the slippery snow, my wacky injured leg, and the amount of weight I was carrying. I had stopped and put my things down to rest for the 4th or 5th time when my sleeping bag in its compression sack jumped out of the Hefty bag and started rolling down the driveway. It was doing a decent job of finding its way down until the driveway made a sharp turn and it went off the side and appeared to go over the edge of a steep embankment that went down to the lake. As I got closer I could see that a small tuft of grass had reached out and saved it from the cold certain death in the dark waters below. As I put my sleeping bag back into the Hefty bag with the rest of my gear I realized that I was further down the hill than I remembered walking before. I quick look around at the one set of downward footsteps verified that I’d made an incorrect turn down the wrong driveway. As I shuffled my way back up the hill I was surprised that the hilarity of the situation had me laughing at myself rather than getting mad for turning the wrong way. Here I was carrying 20 pounds of gear in one hand and a bulky 50 pound keyboard, up a slippery driveway in the dark. And because it’s part of the hiking experience I was enjoying it… I don’t understand it, but somehow hiking the AT is able to change my outlook on life. I made it back to the - correct - house, left my stuff there, and drove down to Johnson City to catch my bus. It’s extra warm here on the bus and the noisy person behind me finally stopped talking.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521197,"It's great to be home for a few days to celebrate our anniversary and Valentines day. I went over and walked in the water therapy pool today. This seems crazy to me, but walking in a pool has been a big part of healing up my shattered hip and nerve damaged leg. Even though it's been almost 3 years since I was injured, I walked in the pool most days during the last 6 months leading up to the restart of my thru hike. The buoyancy of the water creates the effect of weighing about 20 percent of my normal weight. This allows me to practice walking more normally - balanced between each leg - instead of my usual limping shuffle. The other thing this does is it allows me to use and exercise all the little muscles in my foot that need to be strengthened further. Some of you have shared that you're dealing with your own injuries, so if you're on a healing journey, or know someone who is, suggest that they give water therapy a try. Some places have a special pool for it, but you can use any pool with about 4 feet of water in it. I walk for an hour, forward, backward, and then forward again. Some people also walk sideways or do squats in the water. I'm going to enjoy my time at home so that I'm ready to take the bus back to Johnson City on Wednesday. Thanks for signing my guestbook.

It took me about 40 minutes to get in the car and rolling despite having loaded my pack the night before. An hour and 15 minutes later I pulled in to park at Carvers Gap, elevation 5,512 ft.I was going to leave my car at Carvers Gap and shuttle South to start hiking again at Indian Grave Gap. I waited 45 minutes for the shuttle to arrive before heading back down the mountain. As I drove around a bend in the road and picked up cell coverage I heard a new message on my phone. It was Tom, the shuttle driver letting me know that he'd run off the road and hit a tree on Hughes Gap. After stopping to text and make sure he was ok, I headed down to the Mountain Harbor hostel to see if they could shuttle me. I like using my car to assist with my hike but on days like today it seems like extra work. While I waited for the shuttle at Mountain Harbor I got the trail update from Einstein, a younger NOBO. He said that the higher elevations were still covered with 2 or 3 feet of snow in places. ""Well, shucks!"" I thought, since I had optimistically left my larger Stabilicer snow cleats back at my room by Lake Holston. Einstein said that he had a hard time finding the trail due to thick fog, but that he didn't have any snow cleats at all. He also told me that another NOBO who was hiking with him, Bear Whisperer, was concerned about getting lost and turned around to go back South to Greasy Creek Gap. It was almost 10 am by the time I left Indian Grave Gap - headed North, on the Trail, oh yeah!The snow went from a few inches up to 6 or 8 inches as I climbed in elevation. I was able to follow two other hikers tracks until mid afternoon when the wind and snow falling from trees hid the tracks I was following. I was able to find enough white blazes to stay on the trail and picked up the tracks after a few more miles. I made it here into Cherry Gap Shelter by 5:45, just before sundown. There is a nice piped spring close behind the shelter and I'm cooking some lentils for dinner. It seems a bit lonely and cold here - my new digital thermometer is showing 34 degrees right now. I'm going to watch an Amazon Prime movie I had previously downloaded on my iPhone called ""Intersteller"".So I've got shelter, a warm sleeping bag, dinner, and a movie but something seems to be missing...I didn't see any other hikers today and it feels a bit lonely to be here at the shelter all by myself.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521470,"I woke up this morning feeling a little isolated - out in the woods, in the snow, in a shelter by myself. I started hiking at 8:50 am with a goal to reach the next shelter which was about 9.5 miles ahead. My new digital thermometer is able to record the low temp at night - 28 degrees last night. My water wasn't frozen though and I'm now keeping my Sawyer inline filter tucked around my neck and inside my shirt so that it doesn't freeze up like it did last week. I bought a new one to replace the one that I froze while I was making dinner one night last week. I spent the day managing my layering system - putting my raincoat and down jacket on and off, on and off to keep from getting too warm or too cold. The temp climbed up to over 50 degrees but a persistent wind made it feel much colder. At 1:30 I stopped to sit down on a log and rest. I was worn out from working my way uphill thru snow drifts. I could either step into the holes made by the two hikers who had gone before me or try to stay on top of the drifts in areas where the snow had settled and hardened some. The combination of the wind and the uncertainty of ""postholing"" or breaking through the snow with each step seemed to bring up doubts.""What the heck am I doing out here in the snow?"" I asked myself. ""Maybe I should wait until all this snow goes away"".My original plan HAD been to wait for the snow to melt before restarting my thru hike. That's what I did, re-starting back at Sam's Gap on Feb 5th. Then another storm came through. I sat out the storm and the week of cold weather that followed it yet here I find myself hiking along in the snow. My feet are wet and cold and I'm not looking forward to another night out in a shelter followed by a strenuous climb up Roan Mt. tomorrow. The guidebook shows Greasy Creek Gap just 3 miles ahead. There's a hostel which is .6 miles off the trail called the Greasy Creek Friendly. I'm going to head in out of the cold tonight and take a zero (rest day) tomorrow to get some more energy and lift my spirits. I'm at the hostel tonight with Connie, the friendly owner, Gadget, and Cody Coyote. I'm drying out my socks and boots by the woodstove and watching the forensic TV shows one after the other on a huge 78 inch big screen TV. Connie drove down to a restaurant and brought back enough food for me to last tonight and tomorrow while I'm here. I just devoured a double cheeseburger along with a pint of Ben and Jerry's that I pulled out of the freezer here. I'm glad that I decided to take care of myself rather than pushing on. I need to pace myself even when I feel like I'm moving along at a snail's pace. I called my wife to let her know about my change of plans and she reminded me that I'm doing WAY better than I did last year - hiking just 2.6 miles the first day of my thru hike.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521519,"I decided to rest my leg a little more today by slack packing an easy 5.5 miles to Hughes Gap today. ""Slack packing"" means that you leave most of your gear behind and just bring what you need for the day.It was rainy today, so I brought along all my rain gear, some water, and my lunch - a couple of protein bars. The trail was mostly clear of snow for a change - Yah Whoo!I didn't mind the rain at all today since every bit of it that fell was helping to melt the snow drifts on Roan Mountain where I'm headed tomorrow. Connie, the owner of Greasy Creek Friendly hostel came to pick me up at Hughes Gap. I'll stay another night and then catch a ride to Hughes Gap tomorrow morning to get an early start going up Roan Mountain. I saw only one other hiker today, a NOBO named Grok. He said he was going to stop in at the Clyde Smith Shelter for lunch to get out of the rain. I decided to hike on past the shelter when I got there rather than invest any extra time or hiking steps into taking the side trail to the shelter. In the afternoon, I found a pack of Keebler peanut butter crackers on the trail where another hiker had dropped them. Whoever you are, thanks! I felt a little weird eating something I found on the ground but yes, I ate them and they were delicious. I've really enjoyed my time here at the Greasy Creek Friendly. I was a bit worried because of some problems they've had with a neighbor who doesn't like hikers. He used to make noise with his lawn mower or motorcycle to annoy the visiting hikers. It turns out that Gadget, a friend of the owners, took the neighbor to court or mediation and since then the neighbor has actually started talking with them for the first time in 14 years and hasn't caused any more issues. I've been reading some of the other journals of hikers starting out in Georgia. Many of them are doing 15 to 17 miles a day already. I feel a little, uh.. slow and lame doing 5 to 10 miles a day. I mentioned this to one of my daughters and she said that if I was doing 15 mile days then I'd want to be doing 20. This is probably true.

",Hughes Gap,"Feb 21, Sun",5.50
Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521820,"I caught a ride from the Greasy Creek Friendly hostel over to Hughes Gap this morning and started up the long climb to Roan Mountain. I didn’t see any snow at all until reaching 4,900 ft. where I started to see a few remnants of the deeper drifts here and there. A little further on the trail was mostly covered with snow, but thankfully it wasn’t too deep.As I climbed the last few miles to the 6,285 ft. top of the mountain the slushy wet snow turned mostly into ice. The rain had melted most of the snow at this higher elevation but on the trail the packed down snow had turned to ice. I stopped to put on my carbide snow grippers which were a lifesaver for me. The last thing I want to do right now is fall on the ice and break or injure something else. When I was almost to the top I explored a side trail that led to the site of the Cloudland Hotel, a 3 story resort which was built in 1884 for “Pleasure seekers and hay fever sufferers”. Folks back then traveled to the Cloudland by first taking the narrow gauge railroad to Roan Mt Station, TN where an inn provided an overnight stay. Then guests rode by carriage for 12 dusty miles on the newly constructed Carvers Gap Road. There’s not much left of the Cloudland Hotel today. The hotel was shut down in 1904 and eventually dismantled 10 years later. There is a stone chimney a few hundred yards further along the trail but I was told that this belonged to another building, not the hotel itself. A bit further up Roan Mountain, pretty much at the top, I stopped in to see the Roan High Knob Shelter. It’s the highest shelter on the AT at 6,249 ft. It’s also the first shelter I’ve seen to have a door on it. For some reason I thought that I was mostly finished dealing with snow so I decided to change into my spare set of socks. This would allow me to enjoy having mostly dry feet for the rest of the day. It did feel wonderful to have dry socks on. The downside is that it only lasted about 5 minutes until I hit the next slushy portion of the trail. The ice grippers I was wearing helped me down the ice covered pathway. In places melting snow created small streams of water that followed along the trail eating away at the ice or undermining the ice in places to create miniature ice bridges. At times the ice would crack while I was walking over a gap formed by the water eating away underneath. I grew up in a family with seven kids and I was lucky to have two younger brothers near my age to play with. When I was twelve the three of us would go down to the creek behind our house in the wintertime to entertain ourselves. We’d walk along the ice until we found a deeper spot, usually a few feet of water covered by an inch or so of ice. The game we invented was to step, run, or slide across the ice - one at a time - without breaking through into the water. Eventually the ice would start to weaken and crack which of course increased the excitement and anticipation of the game. Eventually one of us would break through so that we were standing in about two feet of very cold water. The rules of the game (which were likely made up that day) required you to “Glug” once you were in the water. Glugging was the sound made by the water as it replaced the air inside the fur lined shoe boots that we all wore. So you had to wait until your boots were completely full of water while the two other brothers hooted and hollered. To keep the game fair and interesting, the rules then required each additional brother to take a turn at “Glugging” to complete the set. You’d think that we’d be outrageously cold, but the water in our boots actually warmed up after five or ten minutes and wasn’t too bad. So that’s what I thought about today as I walked down the North side of Roan Mountain in my wet socks and boots. By the time I descended the 1.5 miles to cross Carver’s Gap the ice and most of the snow was behind me for the day. I saw seven hikers today! 4 NOBOs - Legend, Day Walker, David from Ireland, and Grok.1 Day hiker - Jamie who lived nearby but had hiked the AT in 1995.and 2 SOBO’s who I passed late in the day after it had started raining.I arrived at the semi famous “Red Barn” Overmountain shelter just after dark, I think I was pushing 6:30 or so. The fog was rolling in so thick that I could see better with my headlamp off than I could with it on. I climbed the stairs to join the four NOBOs for the night who had arrived ahead of me. I can hear the rain coming down hard and heavy on the roof of the barn. I’m glad to be warm, dry, and inside tonight.","Hughes Gap

My oldest daughter called and it was nice to be able to send her a real time photo showing her where Dad was on the trail.During the night a mouse ran over my head and for some reason it didn’t bother me. I must be getting used to being a thru-hiker. The morning is spent climbing Little Hump Mt and Hump Mt, along with maybe one other Bald. It’s hard to remember at the moment. Balds are mountains that don’t have any trees on them. This makes for incredibly views on a clear day. It’s unclear wether the balds occurred naturally somehow or if the American Indians kept them clear. At this point the Forest Service mows them to keep trees from taking over. Due to the thick fog which persisted throughout the first half of the day, instead of clear views all I could see was the next 50 yards of trail - usually going straight up hill before evaporating into the fog. The wind was cold and persistent off my right shoulder. It seemed to wear at me as the morning went on. “Are we having fun yet?” I asked myself as I moved ever so slowly up the hill. Somehow even the - not fun parts - of hiking like this add to the adventure and the thrill of hiking the trail. I try to think of how good it’s going to feel once I’m at the top of Hump Mt.After making it over Hump Mt. the trail this afternoon varied to include rock hopping, root avoidance, some nicer easy sections, and plenty of mud slogging. The melted snow and rain has eroded the dirt off the trail and carried it downhill often depositing it in mucky sections that can be up to 6” deep. I do my best to avoid the mud although I’m limited to where I can step by the poor balance my wobbly left ankle provides. It’s about 4:30 when I make it to US 19 and I walk slowly down the side of the paved road covering the last half mile of the day to reach Harbor Mt Hostel where I’ve left my car. I’m going to take the next two days off to give my foot a rest, plus there’s a bit of snow expected that I don’t mind hiking ON but want to avoid hiking IN it as it comes down. The room I rented in a house near Lake Holston is working out great. The owner is friendly, interested in hiking, and enjoyable to hang out with.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522289,"It felt great to change out of my hiker clothes into jeans when I arrived at the AT crossing on US 19 yesterday afternoon. I jumped into my car and hit the Lone Star Steakhouse for dinner on the way back to my room at Lake Holston. Great news… I have my first sponsor! (sound of big band playing with much cheering and clapping) Footscientific.com makes the Elevate Foot Brace that I've been wearing for the past year while I'm hiking. It keeps me from tripping on my left foot since my toes aren't too good at lifting up with each step. If you look at today’s photo you can see the brace on my left foot. This condition, which was caused by my injury three years ago is called foot drop. Fortunately, it’s slowly getting better but for now the brace helps keep my foot up and also works to stabilize my ankle and keep it from spraining when I step on any uneven rocks. Hopefully I can help someone else to walk or hike better by spreading the word about the Elevate Foot Brace. I think it’s fun to have a sponsor. (I had a few sponsors 35 years ago when I used to race motocross) I just emailed Foot Scientific to ask if they would sponsor me by providing a replacement brace at no charge, and they said yes!Over all, my leg and foot are doing much better this year as compared to last year when I first started my thru-hike. Most of the pain that I felt last year has transitioned into sensations of numbness, feeling cold, along with a pins and needles sensation that’s similar to what you might feel if you tried to walk after your leg fell asleep from the circulation being cut off. When it gets really annoying I take some Advil and remind myself that it’s not as bad as it was last year. I realized last year while hiking that I was doing three things that were making the pain WORSE.1) Most of my thoughts were about how much my leg was hurting, or “Why did this ever happen to me” type of pity party thoughts.2) While I was in pain I was holding my breath or taking in just little gasps of air. 3) I was tensing up nearby muscles which was causing my upper calf and hip muscles to be mucho hurting at the end of the day on top of my foot and ankle. I tried a number of things to help with this. One of the simplest was to mentally say “Breathe… Relax…” as I hiked along. This past week I took this a step further by creating some positive, uplifting thoughts to listen to as I hike. I recorded these on my iPhone in a slow, gentle, assuring voice so that I can play this back while I’m hiking. This may sound crazy - but it actually works!Here’s the script I recorded:As you're walking alonglistening to all the sounds around youand the sounds of my voice.. taking in a deep breath .. now.. letting out any stress or busy thoughtsbreathing in again,.. now.. drawing in pure - fresh - oxygenand breathing out… letting go of anything that's been bothering you...taking in another slow, deep, breath…relaxing…letting go…allowing complete and total relaxation to flow down over the back of your headacross your shouldersdown through your bodyletting go.. letting go.. taking in another healing breath now.. and letting go, exhaling out any tension or concernsAs you're walking along..your entire body is letting gomoving along the trailcompletely loose and relaxedright - now - you're taking in all the beauty around youthis day, this hour, this minute, in the wild, on the trailas a special - celebration - of this very moment in your lifeYour entire body is healing...completely and effortlessly…building strength with each and every stepIt's wonderful to be living this lifehiking the Appalachian trailwhile enjoying any pleasant, enjoyable thoughtsthat may be coming to you ... now..

You’ll find that these thoughts will carry thruthe rest of your day and night..Leaving you content, relaxed, and enjoying every moment of this very special day. ============== End of Healing Script ===============I’ve been listening to this almost everyday.If you haven’t used something like this before then your reaction might be to dismiss this or think it’s kinda wacky. All I can tell you is that this works. I’ve used this same method to deal with other challenges in my life with good results each time. My opinion is that by relaxing, your mind becomes less occupied and more open to suggestion. Then the positive encouraging thoughts you listen to are able to replace or push out many of the crappy thoughts we tend to listen to in our heads. In fact, as I’m writing this to you I noticed that over the past few days I’ve been feeling more content and been “enjoying the moment” so much more than I used to. Maybe it’s because I’ve been listening to this audio script.I may create and provide audio scripts like this to help other people deal with challenges in their lives as one of my business ventures once I’m done hiking the AT. Because of this, if you’d like to have your own audio script to listen to, send me one or two paragraphs via my guestbook here. Please list out what you want to change in your life (what you want to stop or get rid of) along with the positive results you’d like to see someday. When I have a zero day I’ll write and record your audio script and then send you the audio file so that you can test this out for yourself. There’s no charge but I’m only able to do this for 5 or 10 people max. All I ask is that you try out listening to whatever I create and send me a short testimonial letting me know if it has helped you.

I skipped a local breakfast place called “The Store” and grabbed a couple of McDonald’s egg n biscuits to help make up for my late start. On the way up to the trail I saw a hiker who was walking along the road in the cold so I stopped to give him a ride. It turns out that “Terry” wasn’t hiking, he was homeless. I asked him if he was able to stay warm in the cold weather and he told me he did ok except it was harder to stay warm at night. It turns out that instead of a sleeping bag he used several blankets to keep the cold at bay. I thought about how tight I have to keep my bag zipped at night to stay warm. He rode with me up to Mt Harbor Hostel where I parked my car. I gave him some protein bars and a few Poptarts. He turned down my offer to take an extra set of gloves and walked away bare handed as the snow flakes fell around him. I feel so fortunate to be blessed with enough so that I can go out and hike without the daily worries that a person like Terry may have to deal with.

It’s not hard to walk through PLUS I’m trying out my new “Rocky Goretex” waterproof socks. Santiago, a NOBO from California, told me about them back at the Greasy Creek Friendly. IMHO they are worth the $65 price tag. My feet are dry for the first time this week! You can get them from Amazon or direct from apsltd.com, a sailing place in my hometown of Annapolis, MD. Make sure to get them big enough. I wear a size 10 shoe, a size 11 hiking boot (room for toes and hiking makes your feet bigger), and I ordered a size 12 Rocky Goretex sock. I wear it per the instructions over top of my thick hiking socks. 2:00 PM - WATERFALL !!Jones Falls is incredible. I can’t believe that the person making the set of tracks in the snow ahead of me didn’t make the .1 mile journey to see these falls. I used a “slow shutter” app on my iPhone to take some photos with the blurred water effect that you can see in today’s photo. Then, just before getting to the shelter tonight… ANOTHER really nice waterfall - Mountain Falls. I’m going to hike back .2 miles in the morning to see this little wonder one last time again before I depart for the day. My new SuperFeet inserts seemed to have made a difference. My (good) foot isn’t hurting in the arch anymore. Oh, (I keep adding more good stuff for today) I made it to the 400 mile mark today. I stomped out “400” in the snow and took a selfie to celebrate. I’ve done more than 400 if you include the miles I did last fall on the AT in VA/MD but 400 sure FEELS nice. Way to go Flash 52 !You Are On Fiya My Man !

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522366,"I did hike back down to see Mountain Falls this morning. What a nice way to get the day going…I had to find my way around 8 or 10 “blow downs” this morning. These are trees that have fallen across the trail blocking the trail. In most cases I’m able to step over the tree trunk or through the branches. Several situations required hiking out around the tree, something that’s hard to do if the trail is cutting across a steep hillside. At the top of today’s big hill I stopped to rest on a bench by the side of the trail. There’s a great view of Big Hump Mt and Little Hump Mt. I thought that I was looking at Roan Mt but once I got down to the Vango Abby Memorial Hostel, Scottie the owner let me know what I was looking at. I took a photo of the nice view and while looking at my iPhone to check out the picture I noticed a strange sign post of some type on the lower left side of the photo. Most signs are right on the trail and this one was about 40 or 50 feet off in the undergrowth. “Happy” June 5 2015 - is what I found inscribed on the sign. The ground below could have been a burial site from the looks of it. Turns out that Happy was a beloved German Shepard that belonged to the owner of the nearby hostel. He said it was about time to take the sign down since it had been up for a year. Speaking of the hostel, I had a heck of a time finding it for two reasons. First off, no one had gone there since the last snow so the side trail didn’t have any tracks on it. The second reason I had a hard time is that I didn’t read Awol’s guide carefully to see that the side trail starts right at the Laurel Fork footbridge. After hiking up and down the small valley and reconsulting the guidebook I finally found a pink ribbon tied to a tree with some clues written on it. I added directions to the comments in Guthooks App to make it easier for other hikers in the future who might frustratingly stomp up and down the valley like I did rather than take the time to read the guidebook.So now I’m here - And there really is a porch piano!I played it some (I’m pretty rusty) and then listened in to Scottie as he tickled the ivories until the sun dropped behind the mountain and the temperature began to drop. I downed a tombstone pizza and a pint of Ben and Jerry’s chuncky monkey ice cream for dinner. As I walked across the large grassy yard over to the bunkhouse I soaked in the massive view of the stars. The Vango Abby Hostel is out in the middle of nowhere so it’s dark enough for the stars to really shine. There’s a meteor shower coming next month. I’ve got the dates marked on my calendar and hope to see some cool falling stars. Ok, it’s just me here. I’ve said hi to the hiker journal on the desk and now I’m going to sleep.","Mountaineer Shelter

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522372,"Nice day today, I got out on the trail at 8:05 which is earlier than normal for me. The trail was a mix of some snow and many parts with no snow at all, especially later in the day as I dropped down in elevation. 12 miles is a long day for me so I took my time and enjoyed the nice views of the valleys off both sides of the ridge as I hiked along it. I almost side tracked down to see Coons Den Falls but thought better of adding any extra miles since my foot was already bothering me some. I arrived at Kinkora Hostel around 4:30 and couldn’t find anyone. The hostel was open so I went in, picked a bunk to drop my pack on and started to figure out how to light the wood stove to warm the place up a bit. It wasn’t long before I was joined by Tin Man and Ice Breaker, a couple of young NOBOs who are hiking together. Next the owner, Bob Peoples, arrived and came into the hostel to get to know us. Bob is a legend on the trail having been involved running Kinkora, maintaining the AT, and hiking all over the world.Bob drove us down to Subway where we loaded up on dinner, cookies, and chips. Bob told us that he’s had 22,000 hikers come by over the years. The walls and ceiling are covered everywhere with Katahdin victory photos. He loves talking with and helping hikers… a super nice guy! Ice Breaker pulled out the Trivial Pursuit game and I was in last place until we decided the next correct question wins… and I got lucky with an easy question. Now I’m laying on the bunk here wondering how many years it’s been since this place was cleaned. It’s only $5 to stay here and the hikers do the cleaning. Or maybe not. Despite this ick factor I really enjoyed my stay at Kinkora and especially meeting Bob Peoples.","Vango Abby Memorial Hostel

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522377,"Bob helped me to slack pack today by shuttling me from my end point back to my car on US 19. Slack packing is where you leave most all your gear behind and hike along with just your water, a raincoat and lunch. It was a gorgeous day with no snow at all on the trail. Whoo Hooo!!Several miles in I stopped to adore Laurel Falls. The guidebook mentions a dangerous whirlpool at the base of the falls and a small sign was on a tree that mentioned the death of a father and son here in 2012. Bob Peoples told me later that he went on the rescue that sad day. He said that 8 or 10 people have died here over the past 10 years. Beauty and sadness together. Up the almost 2,000 ft climb up Little Pond Mountain I go today, using some breathing I learned while training with a “super kick your butt” workout guy named Mac Newton in Phoenix, AZ. If you ever want to get pushed way beyond your limits to where you’re almost dead, go see Mr Newton. I’m not kidding. That’s where the breathing comes in. Mr Newton used to work us so hard (this was before my injury) that you knew you were going to fail at some point, you just didn’t know when. And we paid him for this : ) While working out at Mac’s I discovered that if I was starving for oxygen I could breath in and out rapidly but this didn’t give my lungs time to soak up the oxygen out of the air. The trick was to draw a deep breath in slowly and hold it for a moment even though your lungs were screaming to get more air. Basically you breath deep and relaxed even though it seems your mind is telling you to tighten up and freak out. For hiking, I tell myself “It’s not a hill unless I’m breathing hard”. Then I go up the mountain trying to maintain deep, slow, relaxed breathing. Don’t get me wrong. With my disabled leg I’m maxing out at 1.5 or 1.6 mph. So I’m not breaking any records. But for today I’m able to climb everything except a few steep parts while trying to trick myself that I’m not going uphill. I found a surprise at the top of Little Pond Mountain that I’ll share with you in my journal tomorrow. Stay tuned : ) Before long I’ve covered the 8 plus miles and it seemed like a lot less because my pack was so light. Bob was waiting there to shuttle me back to my car on US 19 where I left it 4 days ago. Good food on the way home to my room on Lake Holston.

March 3rd is three years from the day of my dirt bike racing accident where I shattered my hip and damaged the nerve in my leg.Life as I knew it changed in an instant. I was doing triathlons and had run two marathons. I’d been training for months for my 3rd marathon which was just two weeks away. It’s taken me three years to accept the fact that I’ll likely never be able to run again - ever. And I’m ok with that. I’ve decided that I’d rather focus on what I CAN do rather than focus on what I CAN’T do.And I can hike. I am hiking the Appalachian Trail. If I wasn’t injured it’s likely that I’d never have decided to hike the trail. It’s not what happens to you, it’s what you do about it. So tomorrow is a day to celebrate. (Thanks Jamie for reminding me)And I wanted to get your ideas on how I could celebrate 3 years of healing. If I was better at planning I would have asked you this a couple of weeks ago.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522949,"Off to a good start today… I got my food and pack ready yesterday during my zero day instead of doing it early in the morning like I normally do. This is my day to celebrate 3 years since the day I shattered my hip and damaged the nerve in my leg. I haven’t decided on a formal celebration which I may do another day - for today just being out hiking the AT is where I want to be. Today’s photo is from one year ago when I initially started my thru-hike. If you’ve been reading along you probably know that I got off the trail last year near Erwin, TN after having some issues with my leg and the Noro virus. I then restarted my thru hike almost a month ago in the same location where I stopped last year. I purposely started my thru hike 2 years after my injury as a way of reclaiming my life. (even though I was in worse shape a year ago than I am now) I made a video 2 miles into the AT which explains why I decided to hike. I also pay tribute to my thru hiker friend Brian Hart who passed away recently. Cut and paste this link if you’d like to see the video:https://youtu.be/Dlz8rIvLUTUThis morning I passed the Watauga Lake Shelter which was closed last year due to bear activity. Bears that are able to get food which is not put away correctly can become habituated to looking for more food. This causes the bears to become less cautious of humans which means they may come to the shelter at night to see what they can find to eat. This is what happened here so the shelter was closed for a period of time to encourage the bears to look elsewhere. I’m at Vandeventer Shelter with two other NOBOs, Tyler and Ox who are talking about doing a whopping 32 miles all the way into Damascus tomorrow. At my pace of 6 to 9 miles a day it will take me four days to go the same distance. The snow is coming down outside but I’m warm inside my sleeping bag with only my nose peeking out into the fresh nighttime air.","Shook Branch 
",Vandeventer Shelter,"Mar 03, Thu",9.10
Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522950,"Today was an easy day physically but a tough day mentally. My miles were short and the trail was relatively flat, so no complaints there. Two things were banging around in my head today. One little thing and one big thing actually. First the little thing. The two other NOBOs in the shelter got up this morning and tore out at 5 am planning on hiking 32 miles into Damascus today. I don’t know if they made it… I hope they did and that they are ok. As I hiked my 6.8 miles it bugged me that I’m a Slow-Mo.I know that I’m doing great considering my injured leg, and of course I’m much older than the young whipper snappers who breeze by me. But for some reason today it had me feeling funny. I don’t like to complain so I promise to spit this out quickly and move on, however if I do have a really tough day I feel obligated to share the truth of my adventure good or bad with you. The bigger issue for me today is that yesterday was three years from the date I smashed my hip, dislocated my femur, and damaged the nerve in my leg. Due to my love of motorcycle racing I’ve been injured plenty of times before this but in most cases I was able to heal completely from various broken bones and such within a month or two. For some reason I had the same expectation when I shattered my hip. In fact, to my wife’s bewilderment, I told everyone who came into my hospital room that I was going to be running my next marathon in two weeks time. At this point I’m able to blame this on the morphine that I was on, however I’ve continued for some reason to “Set Dates” upon which I expect to be fully healed. Once I was out of the hospital I decided that I’d surely be able to walk without support at my daughters wedding six months later. (I tried but had to use my cane) This was foretold 15 years earlier when my daughter at age 10 had made a joke about what her dad was going to say at her wedding someday… “Wait for me, I can’t walk” she said as she imitated an old man trying to move along. Hahaha. It’s funny but it’s also not funny. So then I decided that surely I’d be healed up in a year. Then I moved my “I’m all healed up” date back to two years. Finally after learning how slow nerves regenerate and measuring the length from the site of my injury to my toes I realized it would likely take an entire three years for me to heal completely. Well, three years came and went yesterday. And I am slowly getting better. But I’m nowhere close to “completely healed”. I know.. I know.. It could have been worse. I could have hit my head or been killed. I’ve met numerous people over the past three years with various other injuries who are much worse off than I am. My success is in claiming my own pathway to healing by deciding to hike the Appalachian Trail. AND - in the video I made yesterday I finally admitted that I most likely won’t ever be able to run again. That made me feel pretty funky to admit that. So hopefully you can see how these two different thought wavelengths were banging back and forth in my head today. The nice thing about the AT is that when it’s tough you just keep going. So that’s what I did today. I kept walking until I arrived here alone at the Iron Mountain Shelter. I made dinner and was tucked in with my headlamp off when I heard a mouse digging into my pack which was hung on the wall above me. I flipped my light on to reveal a rather tubby looking mouse. He was nibbling on some food that I’d forgotten I’d placed in a side pocket. After getting up to properly stow away the mouse’s treasure along with the rest of my food I decided to name him (or her?) Toby, the tubby mouse. Thanks for riding along with me today. Tomorrow’s a new day with more miles to hike and things to see. It’s kinda strange but being able to share my journey with you helps me through days like today and also makes the incredibly good parts of the AT even better. By looking for good stuff to share with you I’m getting a much richer experience every single day. I appreciate that you're taking the time to read my journal.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522962,"The snow from two nights ago came down in fine particles, almost like a frozen fog. It was cold and cloudy yesterday but this morning the sun came out and began to loosen up the snow/ice crystals from the tree branches enough so that they began to fall to the ground in hundreds of little thunks. After a few hours of this the trail was covered in another inch or so of semi crunchy snow chunks. This had the effect of making the trail less slippery and thus easier to walk along. I crossed TN 91 and found the first gate I’ve found on the AT that required opening. Normally there’s a stile of some sort to climb over when the AT crosses over a fence but this was the beginning of a half mile section created with handicapped access. The trail climbed gently up through a meadow with the handicapped portion ending at a nice bench with a beautiful 270 degree view of the surrounding countryside and mountains. I arrived here at Double Spring shelter at 2:15 and sat down to ponder the idea of hiking 8 more miles to the next shelter. “Let’s see, at my 1.25 mph pace that would get me in at 8 pm, I’d have to use my headlamp.” I thought to myself.I went to get water while I considered making this a long day. I noticed that there really were two springs at Double Spring shelter.. how about that?I remembered telling my father before I left on this five day stretch that my next goal was to get to Damascus but my main goal was to keep from getting worn out physically or mentally. Based on this I decided to be content with my seven plus miles for the day. I gathered up some wood looking for the more combustable smaller sticks because of the dampness caused by the recently melted snow. I was able to occupy several hours by nurturing a small smokey campfire along. Two day hikers stopped by to say hi and (I hate this) stuck their hands out to shake mine. Because of the risk of getting something like the noro virus most thru hikers will either skip the handshake completely or use the more hygienic fist bump method. But what do you do when someone sticks their hand out toward you? You probably shake their hand which is what I did with both of them. After they left I washed my hands and thought about the best way to avoid shaking hands with someone on the trail ideally without offending them in the process. The best I’ve come up with is to tuck both hands together (away from them) up to the chest accompanied by a slight bowing motion. Sort of like the clueless hand grabber meets the Dalai Lama. I’ll try this out and let you know how it goes, or if you have any other ideas please post them using my guestbook on the left side of this journal so that I can field test the best ideas you and I have created together : ) Right now it’s warmer than it’s been lately, 41 degrees AND it’s just started to snow.

If I’m ever going to get to Maine it may be patting myself on the back for little decisions like this that help me along the way.

This shelter is nicely built of stone, has a privy, and a fireplace inside the shelter. I was able to see the first signs of Spring today. The yellow flowers on the bushes here by the shelter are starting to bloom and the farmers fields out in the valley today seemed to turn bright green overnight. I’m enjoying the solitude both on the trail and in the shelters at night when I’m alone. This seems a bit odd for me as in the past I’ve felt isolated on the trail even when surrounded by other hikers at the shelters in the evening. Somehow I’ve discovered the beauty of the quietness, the stillness, the realness that happens when all of the everyday distractions disappear.","Dickey Gap

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524101,"I met two younger NOBO hikers today called The 60’s. They are named that because their packs both weighed 60 plus pounds when they first started. I was excited to get to Partnership shelter to find out if it really was true that you could have pizza delivered right to the shelter. By the time I got there 60’s and “60’s also” were both eating large pizzas. 60’s explained that there’s a $30 minimum order and I wasn’t sure about getting two large pizzas for myself. I sat down to rest a bit while I pondered this and was having a good time hearing the stories from these two about hiking thru the Smokies in the deep snow. Right when I was about ready to walk over to the Mt Rogers Visitors center to use the phone on the back porch to place my pizza order, 60’s offered to let me have the last two slices from his box. “Are you sure?” I asked, trying not to grab the pizza too quickly as I said this. Perfect, two slices is about all I need, I thought to myself. Turns out I was able to help them out by giving them the key to my car that was waiting for me in Atkins. The actual town of Atkins is 3 miles down the road and “60’s also” had to get to the post office to pick up a resupply box of his. I asked him to leave the key in the super secret location on top of the front tire. I found some interesting entries in the shelter journal tonight. I took photos of them and will share some of them with you later. Speaking of the shelter journal, there’s a NOBO named Dr John who’s been writing rather extreme political statements in the journals. He blew by me in the Grayson Highlands saying something about how far he was behind schedule as he walked right past me without breaking his stride. At the Trimpi shelter last night he had written something that starts out with “The reason the Republicans are such morons is… “ I decided to have some fun so using the same pen and mimicking the shaky lettering of Dr John, I added “(trump supporter)” right after his name. The 60’s obviously stopped in to sign the journal at the Trimpi shelter since they brought his name up along with his incongruous entry. “Really, he wrote that?” I said, testing to see if my forgery of his handwriting had passed muster. “Yes, I looked carefully at it and it was in the same handwriting.” “Hahahaha…” I responded, letting them in on my little joke. In the journal here at the Partnership shelter Dr John had written another note, finishing with “I write interesting things, At least I don’t write - Last night I had pizza”So 60’s made the next entry:Last night I had pizza. 60’s It’s nice to talk with some other hikers for a change. I can hear the insects making noise out in the night forest. I wonder if this is something new that comes along with the arrival of Spring. I’ve been sleeping really well at night lately. It seems that somewhere along the line I’ve settled into thru hiking. I don’t feel out of my element like I did when I was out on the trail last year. Thanks for reading this journal.

Despite this I staying in my sleeping bag, turning from side to side and massaging the sore muscles in each of my hips. I noticed that my knee didn’t hurt last night. I’ve been using a new brace that I got from CVS to give it some more support. I sprung for the most expensive one with the hinges that will hopefully keep my knee from hyperextending, which is what I discovered it’s called when your knee goes the wrong way like mine did a few days ago. Finally I got up, and made my daily hot chocolate to go with my frosted cinnamon pop tarts breakfast. I was able to get hiking by 8:30 which is earlier than I’ve done lately. I decided to combine my last two days into one by hiking almost 12 miles into Atkins. I stopped at the Settlers Museum and checked out an old one room schoolhouse that had been saved or restored. The local church had several boxes of “Trail Magic” for hikers in the schoolhouse. Trail Magic is anything.. food, clothing, free rides, that is offered by various people to help thru hikers with their adventures. In this case there were foot warmers, hats, mittens, gloves, and some handmade scarves. Very nice to have people looking out for you : ) I mentally fussed preparing to talk with the owner of the Relax Inn in Atkins where I had left my car. I had told him I was expecting two boxes from Amazon to be shipped there and he had said that his fee was going to be $5 for EACH box, unless I stayed at his (super rundown) motel. Turns out that when I limped into the parking lot he came out from vacuuming a room asking if I was ok. “I’m fine… old injury… “ I said, and then asked him how his day was going. After I mentioned the boxes I was looking for he went into the office and brought them out to me.“Here you go, no charge.” He said, smiling at me. Wow. Thanks. By the way - It used to really bother me when people asked me if I was ok. I would get angry at them. I realized today that I don’t do this anymore.

I dismissed his warnings since I actually like going up hills however I would find out in a few days when I hit that section exactly what he was talking about.Big cheese also shared the story of how he was stationed in Iraq and within 20 minutes from leaving at the end of his one year stay he was shot in the leg and in the arm and had suffered similar nerve damage to what I've experienced myself. It was motivating for me to see him doing so well despite his serious injuries.Eddie, the right-hand man to Joe at Four Pines Hostel, drove me back down the trail just north of the captains were I had left off hiking two days ago. I started out hiking and then quickly realized I was walking on a trail that was NOT the Appalachian Trail. I've learned to be especially careful when first starting out as it's easy to just look up, see a trail and start following it without realizing that I'm not following the white blazes. After a quick turnaround I found the right trail, crossed the road, and began hiking northward on the Appalachian Trail once again.   After hiking by myself during the morning another northbounder named Old Grouse joined me and was willing to hike with me even though I go at a much slower pace than most people. It was nice to be able to talk with someone while hiking and I learned of the many places that Old Grouse had been including Costa Rica, the Dominican republic, and various other places. He told me about two other northbounders named Otis and Mongo who he had met at the captains. It seems that there were some frozen fish there that they were going to ask the captain if it was OK for them to take along on their hike and cook tonight at the upcoming shelter. Old grouse seemed to like the idea of this as he was low on food and getting a bit hungry.When we finally got to the war spur shelter Otis and Mongo were were well underway in the cooking of their fish. They had made a large fire, cooked it down into red coals and then placed a good size rock on top of the coals followed by the first of several fish that they would be cooking. This first fish have been named ""Little Jimmy"" and was roasting nicely on top of the rock when the rock exploded, most likely due to some moisture inside of it. ""Little Jimmy"" was thrown up into the air, Mongo lept back from the fire in surprise, and Little Jimmy landed in the dirt near the fire. Mongo, who was happy that he was not injured by the exploding rock, retrieved little jimmy, cleaning him up, and shared the fish with the rest of us. The next fish to be cooked was called ""the king"" as he was a larger size trout. Just as the king was about done being cooked the next rock exploded as well - flinging the king about 20 feet up in the air. Mongo was actually almost able to catch him on the way down this time. Otis and Mongo make quite a pair as they thought it was hilarious that the rocks were exploding and of course Old Grouse and myself couldn't help but join in with the laughter. I cooked my usual lentils and mashed potatoes as I sat on the picnic table by the fire. As it began to get dark we were enjoying the warm evening and the nice feeling one gets while sitting by a campfire out in the wilderness. The wind started picking up and was blowing quite vigorously through the trees above us when we heard a loud crack of a branch over our heads. Suddenly, all four of us jumped up and ran into the shelter for cover. I was shouting out with glee saying ""that's amazing, I haven't been able to run in three years!"" Old Grouse was moaning because he had not seen the edge of the shelter in the dark and ran right into the edge of the shelter with his shins.

My leg seems to work better going uphill than it does downhill so my preference is to climb uphill as long as it's not too steep.I also went through a number of nice grassy pastures today which is an interesting change from going along the ridge or through the woods. I seem to enjoy the nice view over the farmland which is greening up quite nicely as spring is well on its way.

It is over 300 years old. I noticed a very nice campsite there with a bunch of firewood stacked up right by the fire pit. I decided that since it was so late and the campsite looked so nice I would go ahead and stay there for the night. Several cows came by including a smaller calf who was curious about the fire I had going and the meal I was cooking. They came over to check me out since I was camping in their pasture.

The wind was picking up as I hiked along and I was concerned about securing my tent in the wind. Fortunately the hill to my left rose up above the fire road and I saw where this would provide protection from the wind which was coming in off to my left. As a result of this I decided to camp right along the trail for the night. There was a little bit of rain and also some snow that came down during the night, however I stayed warm and dry inside my tent with the exception of some hot chocolate I managed to spill right before I went to bed. I used one of my hiking socks to mop this up while texting my oldest daughter about this little mishap.","Camp by the Keffer Oak

This involved the two characters Otis and Mongo, whom I had met several days prior with their exploding fish adventures.It seems that a skunk had wandered into the camp during the night and they initially tried to shoo it away. Then the skunk came back and actually jumped on Mongos back as he slept out on his cot in the night. Mongo leapt up trying to get the skunk off of him and in the process cut the bottom of his foot open on a rock. After much yelling, poking with hiking sticks, smacking it with a hiking boot, and a final ""Tiger Woods"" swing of a large branch the score was one dead skunk and one seriously damaged Mongo foot.A skunk that acts like this is most likely rabid so while I feel badly for the skunk, I'm glad that no one was bitten.  Later in the afternoon today I climbed up a series of ridges to get to Dragon's tooth. There was quite a fair amount of scrambling up over rocks to get up to Dragon's tooth so I was happy when I got there looking forward to an easy down hill trail to take me back down to the four points Hostel. I was quite surprised to find numerous challenging places on the trail where I had to carefully make my way down over the edge of small cliffs and other obstacles in order to get back down to the road.I was happy when I finally reached the road turning east and walking a half-mile up the hill towards the 4 pines Hostel. When I got there it was great to see Otis and Mongo who was recovering from his recent skunk attack.","Camp near Audie Murphy Monument

The 4 mile hike up from the road crossing looked to be very well-traveled and I saw numerous groups of young Hikers coming down with music playing from McAfee's knob.I was excited to get to the top around 5 PM and there were five or six other day hikers up there who assisted me in getting some good photos taken.I was worried about getting close to the edge but wanted to get a good shot with me sitting on the edge of the knob with my legs hanging off. I follow the advice of another hiker and scooted carefully up to the edge while she used my iPhone to take numerous pictures. When it was time to get up I realized that my pack had slid over a piece of the ledge and that I was not able to push back from the edge by myself. I called out to another hiker who was nice enough to come over and grab onto my pack and pull me back from the edge. It was with a little bit of regret that I finally left McAfee's knob with its gorgeous views and made made my way less than a mile down to Campbell shelter where I'm currently spending the night.

The fluffy clouds in the sky provided a patchwork quilt of sunny and shaded spots to give the view a great deal of variety.It threatened to rain all day and I must've had my raincoat on and off eight or 10 different times. It even hailed for a little bit this afternoon at one point. I also saw a beautiful rainbow which I took a photo of however the actual experience came out to be much better then the photo.I was happy to get down into Daleville at the end of the day.

I've been hiking so well on my leg that I assumed I would be able to walk much better once I was off the trail. I think when I'm hiking I have the support of my hiking boots along with my various braces plus the support of my hiking poles which help to stabilize my gait. Also my leg tends to warm up after a while of movement and found that when I was walking around at my parents house or in town I would be sitting still and then get up and move for a little ways and then sit down again before moving for a little ways so all of my movements were done while my leg was relatively stiff.It felt good to get away but weird to go from hiking to not hiking then back to hiking.

It's a nice clean motel and it's up the hill above the highway so you look out across and see the beautiful mountains instead of looking out on the interstate.The restaurant there was closed so I drove down into Buchanan and had pizza and a Diet Coke at a bar there. It was interesting to watch the other patrons get drunker and louder as the night went on.Today was an interesting day because I've been off for four days driving up to Maryland to see my wife and family. It felt strange to take a break from hiking and now today it feels very strange to be back on the trail again. My leg and foot is bothering me quite a bit which is surprising since I had a four day rest. I think walking on it daily helps to keep it stretched out and nimble and so today may just end up being a little harder than a normal hiking day for me.I stopped at the Fullhardt shelter to try out the cistern water system which works great. Rainwater is collected on the roof of the shelter and runs down into a cistern, then a pipe runs a little further down hill where you open a spigot to fill up your water bottle.It was a fairly smooth trail today which was nice since my leg was a squaking a bit. I got more into the tempo of things as the day progressed. Late in the day my oldest daughter gave me a call while I was stopping to fill up with water and I was surprised that she was able to reach me even though I was completely surrounded by hills on all four sides. It's so nice when I'm able to text or talk from the trail. I didn't start hiking today until about 1030 so todays 11 miles took me until 8 o'clock to reach the Wilson Creek shelter. It's still light enough to hike at 8 o'clock without a light and I noticed that there was already one other hiker in the shelter in a sleeping bag when I got there.The other hiker was named DP and is an older gentleman who has spent two days hiking in from Daleville. He hasn't been feeling well and has been sick, throwing up. I'm a little concerned for him. I had a nice chat talking to him as I cooked my lentils and mashed potatoes and then we both thought it was a good idea for him to hike up in the morning to the Blue Ridge Parkway and perhaps get a shuttle back into Daleville so that he can rest up before continuing his hike.Overall, it feels great to be back out on the trail again, although still a little strange.

The trail was mostly moderate slopes and a smooth trail - A perfect day for hiking.My wife asked me when I visited her a few days ago what I think about all day long while I'm hiking and I couldn't really explain it. So today I was paying attention to what I think about. It's surprising that much of what I do when I walk along is to simply enjoy the moment of being out on the Appalachian Trail and hiking in the great outdoors. I also listen to audiobooks at times. John Grisham is one of my current favorites. Sometimes I think about funny things that my kids did growing up or many of the awkward, stupid, or fun things that I've done throughout my life. The nice thing about having so much time just to be quiet and think is that I can process through and get a chance to enjoy again many of the funny moments I've had. Or think through mistakes I've made and work my way towards forgiving myself for being less than perfect on occasion : ) At lunchtime today I walked past one of the scenic overlooks on the blue Mountain Parkway and Cory and Karen, some trail angels from Roanoke were nice enough to provide me with a delicious fresh salad that included pinenuts, feta cheese and strawberries.  My leg and foot felt much better today so my theory that it takes a day of hiking to loosen things up that I mentioned to you yesterday seems to be accurate. I also was able to get into the groove or mode of hiking much better today and didn't tend to ponder how much more wonderful it would be to be home at my house with my wife, dog, hot tub, piano and nice warm water bed.

While crossing the bridge I looked down to see Last Chance soaking his feet in the cool river. He started last year hiking North from Harper's Ferry to Katahdin. During this stretch he had two different incidents that could have easily ended his thru hike. The first was 1st and 2nd degree burns he suffered when he spilled boiling water on his leg. The second was a staph infection that infected an insect bite on his hip. Last Chance at 63 years is eight years older than me, hikes faster than me (like most people : ) and has incredible persistence. I found it quite motivating to talk with him today. After wishing him the best of luck on his remaining 270 miles I drove a mile up the road to Middle Creek Campground. I needed to pick up a box of gear I'd shipped and meet Stephanie, a reporter from the Roanoke Times. I had met a friend of Stephanie's a few weeks ago while hiking who introduced me as a possible news story. I have to admit that it was fun having a photographer snap shots of me while I browsed through the supplies at the store. We then drove back to the trailhead for more photos, and some hiking videos while I filled Stephanie in on the details of my motorcycle racing accident three years ago.

Camping out... Not so great. The playing fields were fenced and locked when I arrived at 11:15 pm. Hmmm... last year there were all kinds of RVs, no gates, and plenty of room to camp out. This year the event is obviously being held in a new location. It's interesting how hiking the Appalachian Trail is able to convince me that I can get by with less. Rental car... don't need it.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528347,"I hiked less than 4 miles today but didn't start until just after 5:30 PM : )To avoid another fiasco like the previous night, I spent last night in a hotel near the airport in Orlando, FL. I was here for a day to watch my son play paintball at the collegiate paintball nationals. I felt strangely out of place in a quiet hotel after getting used to sleeping out on the trail in shelters or in my tent. I think the difference was I didn't hear the sounds of the night, the wind, or any wildlife. The other difference is that I've learned to trust my place in the wilderness. What I mean by this is that when I first went out to sleep in the woods I was scared to death. I didn't know what was going to happen or if anyone was going to come and bother me. Now I'm comfortable sleeping along the trail. It's almost like the solitude of being away from everyone provides me with a nice warm safe feeling that I didn't have while sleeping at the hotel.So I flew from Orlando through Charlotte, North Carolina on my way back to Lynchburg. The Charlotte airport is pretty big and required quite a bit of walking to get from the arrival gate to my connecting flight. I managed to walk through the entire airport without needing any assistance. While this might seem like something anyone who's hiking the Appalachian Trail should be able to easily do, a year and a half ago I would have to be pushed in a wheelchair because I was unable to walk long distances.Healing from a tramatic injury like I had comes very slowly over time. One of the most frustrating parts of getting better is that you get better so slowly it's hard to notice that you're improving. Realizing that I'm now able to walk through the airport without assistance let me know that hiking the Appalachian Trail really is healing me.I had lined up my shuttle to pick me up in Buena Vista,VA at the trailhead on route 60. I was going to shuttle south to the point near Buchanan, VA where I stopped hiking a few days ago. I was in a bit of a hurry as the flight had been delayed and I didn't want to keep my shuttle driver waiting. So mistakenly entered the address for Buchanan into my GPS instead of the address for Buena Vista. It wasn't until about 10 minutes before arriving that I realized my mistake. I had driven to the South end rather than the North end where my shuttle driver was waiting for me. Oh well. Mistakes happen. I drove up the hill so I could get a cell phone signal, called the shuttle driver and let him know that I would pay him for the shuttle even though I had never shown up. I ended up parking my car along the trail in Buchanan and will have to shuttle back down to get the car once I reach Buena Vista in another four days. Using a car as I do to carry my supplies and paying for shuttles up and down the trail is certainly more complicated then not having a car. However I really like to have all of my food supplies on hand, and the ability to take the car to do things like drive to the airport as I did today so I could see my son. It's also very helpful if I need to go to an outfitter, resupply at a grocery store, or simply need to nuture my spirit with a good steak dinner. I don't recommend that most hikers use a car as I do, however it seems to be the right thing for me. Hike your own hike, the saying goes. So I breezed up the hill and made the 3.8 miles rather quickly to the Bryant Ridge shelter here which is one of the largest and fanciest shelters I've seen on the trail. It sleeps about 14 people and has three levels. I expected to see it full of the surging northbound Hikers that I keep expecting, but I'm all alone here tonight.As I lay here looking out into the woods I can hear the stream running nearby along with the other sounds of the woods.

A SOBO hiker had told me where to look a few days ago but unfortunately I didn't pay close attention to his instructions. ""How hard could it be to find a spring along the AT?"" I recalled thinking at the time. So here I was hiking up and down a fire road looking for water in the gathering darkness. After searching for 45 minutes I went back to the section of trail where I thought the spring should have been. I was surprised to find a big note held down by a rock that was right on the trail - right where I'd walked by 45 minutes ago. Ah ha! A note that points out the spring which is just 50 yards downhill. I wondered how I managed to walk by the note when I was specifically looking for the spring. Oh well, at least I'd have water to make dinner. Turns out the spring was just a trickle and I had to use a straw like plastic tube I carry to create a mini water spout that I could use to fill up my water bottle.

The cloudy day provided cooler temperatures for the 2,000 foot climb up to the ridge top. Because I had downed a large bottle of Gatorade on the way to the trail I was able to pass by the 6/10 of a mile side trail to the first shelter along with the 3/10 of a mile trail to the spring at Hog Camp Gap. After a few showers the afternoon sky looked threatening so I decided to try to make it to the next shelter, a total of 14 miles which is close to my longest day so far. I've always used a trash bag liner inside my pack to keep everything nice and dry up until 4 or 5 days ago when I decided the weather was so dry that I didn't need it.Big mistake... Around 4:30 the sky opened up and it rained... hard. My pack cover, which is allegedly waterproof, got soaked and then allowed the falling water to work its way through my entire pack. I thought of stopping a few different times to check my pack and retrieve my trash bag liner from the bottom of pack where I had stashed it the week before. Each time I convinced myself that things would just get even wetter since it was raining so hard. The rain along with the cooler temperatures provided good motivation and hiking conditions for me to scurry the entire 14 miles along a decently smooth trail in record time. I arrived at the Seeley-Woodworth shelter to join Seam, another NOBO for the night. Every single thing I was wearing and that was in my pack was wet except for my sleeping bag (luckily) which was protected by a compression dry bag. I put up a clothes line, hung everything up and went to bed wearing just a pair of rather damp shorts. This was a good lesson for me to stay with my hiking system including using my trash bag liner even on days when I don't think I may need it. I'm also going to start carrying an extra set of clothes protected by another dry bag so that I have something that I can change into after getting doused by the rain. Getting wet is a part of any thru hike and today I learned (or re-learned) how to better deal with this. The funny thing is that I used to always use my bag liner and I used to carry an extra set of clothes. The dry weather had caused me to become complacent along with my focus on being light weight ended up with another situation where I had left my common sense behind.

I noticed a few food bags hanging from a tree and I wondered if they were getting a late start or had arrived early to spend the night. Seam, the NOBO that I had spent last night with at the Seeley-Woodworth shelter showed up along with another thru hiker and suddenly there wasn't enough room for everyone to sit down. This seemed strange to me after hiking for two and a half months and seeing only a handful of hikers each week. I sent a text with an ETA to my sister who would be picking me up at the bottom of the hill and started down the mountain. The trail was pretty steep and rocky and I moved quite slowly down as I looked for a relatively flat place to place my injured foot with each step. Several worn out looking SOBO hikers were making their way up the mountain. Each of them asked if it was much further to the top and I tried to be encouraging without saying ""You're almost there"".I stopped at the overlook that was 3/4 of the way down and a nice family there took the photo you see here today. I continued down and was pleased to see that the trail smoothed out a bit and also became less steep. I was wondering how much further I had to go when I was surprised to see my sister hiking up to meet me. Wow, a familiar face out here on the AT. We hiked the last half mile or so together and met my brother in law who invited me to sit down in some camp chairs that he had put up in the parking lot along Rt 56. I enjoyed a glass of wine along with a few chocolate chip cookies they had brought along to feed to the other thru hikers and myself. I met Rooster, a really cool NOBO who had served in Iraq. He works as a park ranger and is taking some time off to hike the AT. He's a bit famous because he was in the shelter at Deep Rock Gap that was hit by several falling trees earlier this year. My brother in law invited him to join us for the night and I got to know Rooster better as we both chowed down a delicious dinner and enjoyed staying at my sister and brother in laws house.

Chris and Lisa took the lead while I pushed along at a slightly faster than normal pace to keep up with them. They've hiked here before and were able to point out various short cut trails, however they were nice enough to understand that I'm trying to hike the white blazes and we worked our way up the AT to the shelter. At first glance it appeared that all the local firewood had already been found and burned but then Lisa and I scored at a few of the nearby vacant campsites and snatched plenty of wood. Chris made an impressive looking Tee-Pee style fire as we cooked our meals. It's wonderful to be able to hang out on the AT with my own family. We've had a good time talking and now it's getting dark - time to go to sleep. There were several entries about aggressive mice in the log book including one entry from a hiker who claimed to have killed one mouse along with a warning to be on the lookout for another mouse who walks with a limp. I, of course, feel a certain kinship with the limping mouse and am happy and content to be in a nice shelter along with some of my amazingly supportive family.","VA Rt 56 Tye River Crossing

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529900,"This morning I said goodbye to Lisa and Chris and headed up the mountain trail. The climb up to Three Ridges Mountain was fairly steep and somewhat rocky at the top. A few thru hikers went past me and I met a number of day hikers who were heading South. My plan for the day was to hike about 13 miles so that I could reach Rock Fish Gap in two days and reach the bottom of Shenandoah Park. Most of the thru hikers are concerned about the recent forest fire and having to bypass around the fire in the park. I actually hiked most of Shenandoah Park and most of the trail in Maryland during this past fall and winter. So once I reach Rock Fish Gap I plan to finish one twenty mile un-hiked stretch of trail in the North end of the park and then go home for a few days before starting in again six miles South of Pennsylvania. I was pushing along the trail trying to pick up my pace a bit since the climb up the hill had progressed at just one mile per hour. Then I got a text from Lisa...""We're doing Trail Magic for you at Reed's Gap"".Wow! Really... ? That's awesome!I texted Lisa my expected ETA and scurried down the trail. I was rewarded with ice cold lemonade, hot chicken wings (I ate every single one of them) and a glass of Chardonnay. I was just starting to think about the remaining miles I had for the day when Chris said ""Why don't you come back to the house with us?"" ""I can drop you back off right here tomorrow morning"".""Sounds great!"" I responded.So now I'm back at their beautiful house that has a view of the ridge line the AT runs along from the front porch. Another delicious dinner...

I decided that I was going to enjoy hiking today rather than falling into the trap of only focusing on how far I can make it each day. The trail was decent today with a few smaller hills and some rocky sections that required me to slowly pick my way through as I looked for a flat spot to put my injured foot down. I saw a few section hikers and three SOBOs but no other NOBO hikers. It rained on and off today. I had expected this so I brought my slightly heavier Marmot raincoat which works better than the lighter frogg togg coat I've been using. I also packed a dry shirt, shorts, and socks inside a drybag along with correctly using the trash bag liner in my pack. It was nice to arrive here at the shelter and change into dry clothes. It got dark about 30 minutes ago and I'm the only one here. The rain is pouring down and there have been a few loud and close lighting strikes.

I drove past this in my car and thought it was interesting to see - I'm hiking well North of the fire area. Rainy out today and I had quite a few moments when I wondered if filling in this little piece of trail I had missed previously was worth it. No views, just all rainy and foggy. I decided to get er done, put my head down and hiked along. When I got to the signpost indicating Elk Wallow Wayside was just .1 miles down a side trail I managed to turn the wrong way. I was in a hurry since I was trying to get there before the wayside closed. My thoughts were that if I go there when it was open this would make it easier for me to hitch a ride 20 miles South back to my car. I walked much further than .1 miles before deciding to turn back and look at the sign again. Ah Ha ! I went the wrong way which is actually a fitting end at this point. You see, when I first started from here last fall I left Elk Wallow Wayside and somehow walked right by this same signpost without making the turn from the side trail onto the AT. So I started out lost and ended up lost : ) So I got something to eat and then went out to the road to see if I could hitch a ride. After 20 minutes without a single car driving by in the fog I decided to call the cab company listed in AWOLs guidebook. They hit me up for $90 but I didn't want to spend the night there so I agreed to pay it (and wait an hour for them to get there)The driver had never been in the park before and had no idea where the wayside was. He was told that I would be waiting on a picnic bench out back so he was driving from one spot to the next and honking his horn each time he saw another picnic bench. After hearing various far away honks in the fog he finally pulled into the lot.While driving me he asked if I was into science and went on to explain how he's been watching ""all these videos"" on YouTube that explain why the world is really flat and how the government faked the moon landings...

Then she shared how I saw the movie ""Wild"", read a few AT books and started talking about hiking the Appalachian Trail. She explained how she thought this highly unlikely including the doubts brought up when I aborted my four mile flat ground test hike after going just over one mile because my leg was hurting me so much. She explained how I went down to Georgia and started anyway, hiking just 2.5 miles the first day. And how since then I've managed to hike a total of 1057 miles on the Appalachian Trail so far.

By the time I had stopped by to see my parents in Frederick, driven up into Pennsylvania, parked four days up the trail and shuttled down to my start point it was already past 1:30 pm. I began hiking today at Raven Rock Rd which is the furthest point North that I made it while section hiking the stretch from Shenandoah through West Virginia and most of Maryland during this past fall and winter. The trail started out with a nice up hill but before long was reasonably making it's way through the last six miles of Maryland woods that I would be seeing. While I was home I created an excel sheet that tallied up all my hiking days so far this year. Here's what I came up with:Total days hiking: 58Total days off (resting or visiting family) : 31Average miles per hiking day: 9.7 milesAverage distance traveled per day including rest days: 6.3 milesAt this pace it's going to be tight for me to get up to Maine and make it to the top of Katahdin before the mountain closes sometime in mid October. So, my plan was to get in at least 10 miles a day and preferably make it 12 miles or maybe a bit more each day. The trouble today was that with my late start I was running out of daylight and I didn't really want to be night hiking on a section that can get a bit rocky at times. When I stopped at Pen Mar park to get water to carry along with me for dinner I realized that my collapsible canteen was leaking. I've recently replaced this so it's a bit frustrating to see the new one leaking so soon. Oh well...I decided to stop at Pen Mar Park to make my dinner right there by the water spigot. A gentleman walked by and upon learning that I was a thru hiker (of sorts) cheered me on wishing me good luck. After dinner I walked another mile passing the Mason Dixon Line into Pennsylvania and as it was getting dark out, decided to set up my tent at a site near a stream. I'm the only one here and it's nice to be close enough to be able to hear the water rushing down the creek bed. I am, however, somewhat disappointed to discover that my air mattress is no longer able to hold air.While I was home for my 1,000 miles on the AT party I had noticed our cat doing something to my thermo-rest pad but somehow optimistically convinced myself that it would be fine. It's not. In fact, it's completely flat on the ground.

First off, I'd like to get my average daily milage up a bit so that I'm more likely to be able to make it to Mt Katahdin before it closes in mid October. The second reason is that I had planned on hiking 10 or 12 miles a day so that I'm able to reach the pre-planned point where I can meet Emily, my old physical therapist, who is planning on hiking with me this coming Saturday. So I did 14 miles which is for sure a longer day for me, but the problem was that I went over so many rocky-tricky sections that my foot was hollering at me when I finally made it into the shelter at about 8 pm. There were two shelters, interesting that Pennsylvania seems to have a number of double shelters like this, and both of them looked full. Because the forecast was for a rainy night, I asked nicely if there was room for one more and a spot was made for me when everyone scooted over a bit. I had stopped today at a stream to submerge my sleeping pad and found two holes which I did my best to patch with some repair tape that I carry.

She has section hiked portions of the AT with her father in the past and was very supportive of my decision to go out and attempt the AT. After yesterdays short three mile hike and rest at the hostel my foot and leg were feeling much better.

I do realize that there are some serious rocks coming up soon in Pennsylvania, so I'm not out of the woods.. ur.. rocks yet.

Before long we arrived at the Pine Grove Furnace State Park where there's a little grocery store which is the site of the official 1/2 gallon ice cream challenge. Thru hikers are supposed to eat 1/2 gallon of ice cream to celebrate making it half way on the AT.I looked at the ice cream... cheap (non premium brand... hey.. I'm spoiled, I admit it) and in flavors that I didn't really care for - so I decided to pass it up for the moment. Emily pulled out some Oreos that she brought along for me and I downed a bottle of Gatorade from the store. We jumped in my car, which I had left at the park a few days ago, I drove Emily back to her car and then I treated myself to a steak dinner at a Texas Roadhouse restaurant that I found along I-80.

So today's hike actually headed southbound for a change and I filled in the 11 miles that I had jumped past yesterday. When I was home in Maryland last weekend for my 1,000 miles on the trail party, I found a leg brace that I had tried using about 1.5 years ago. Back then it seemed to dig into my (sensitive) foot so I had stopped using it. I thought I would try it out at some point and since today's slack pack is bringing me back to my car in just one day I decided to see if this old brace might help support my ankle better over some of Pennsylvania's rocks. It turns out that the trail today had just a few rocks and was fairly flat so I was able to make it back to US 30 by about 3:30 pm and I decided to walk the .8 miles down the road to get back to the hostel. I found I could hike easier with the leg brace on however by the time I reached the hostel my foot and calf were killing me. I took some advil and crashed on the sofa for a few hours to try and ignore the pain coming from my leg. My best guess is that the brace helped to support my ankle but did not allow the movement which typically allows my calf muscle to stretch out while hiking.

I wanted to say hello and pet the dog so I walked over to join the other hikers who were sitting around a fire pit that didn't have a fire in it.They looked at me a little strangely and weren't very welcoming.

It looks like a good setup for the rain but I'll probably stay with my trusty raincoat. At about midnight last night I was awoken by the sound of something or someone walking outside my tent. Whatever it was, it was big enough to crack the branches on the ground and I wondered if a bear had come by to see if it could reach my food bag hanging from a nearby tree. I realized that I didn't have anything at all to protect myself. I'm into hiking light so I don't have a gun or even a knife of any size. I thought of using my hiking poles but they were occupied holding my tent up. I turned my headlamp on but it just reflected the light back from the inside of the screen door on my tent. I thought of unzipping the screen so that my light would work better but somehow I didn't want to part with the physiological barrier which the screen provided. I know that sounds crazy but that's what I was thinking. After shining the light on my screen door I heard a few more cracks and then it was quiet except for the sound of my heart which was racing. I lay there unable to go back to sleep for about a half an hour before convincing myself that there really wasn't much of anything that I could do to stop a bear if it was determined to get me. Eventually I went back to sleep. The ""very rocky trail"" mentioned in the guidebook slowed me down a bit today but wasn't nearly as bad as I had worried it might be. For the most part I was able to find a flat spot to put my left foot down on so I did ok with it. I had also been warned by someone at the Doyle Hotel that the decent into Duncannon involved boulder clambering that he thought I might have a hard time with. It turns out that the decent involved quite a bit of stair steps but didn't require me to climb down over any boulders. Perhaps the local trail maintenance crew has improved the trail since the last time this fellow had hiked it here. I met Boogie Pilgrim on the way down and offered to drive him over to the grocery store so that he could resupply.

I left the Baltimore airport and headed north towards Duncannon, PA where I had left the trail on Thursday. I was hoping to get started hiking at about 12:30 but by the time I stopped for lunch, checked emails, updated my journal, and drove back to the trail it was 3 pm. I tacked on another 1/2 hour by starting out without my knee brace before realizing it and turned around to go back and get it.I hiked south so that the long road walk into Duncannon would be at the end of the day when I'd likely be running out of daylight. This would also put me back at the Doyle Hotel where I could sleep and get dinner so that I wouldn't have to carry most of my gear today. The trail is green with fast growing assorted vines and bushes including a fair amount of poison ivy which I take care to avoid. My brother Paul, who works on a farm in Maine, told me years ago that he ""Stays away from greenery"" and I think of this while looking at the strong and healthy poison ivy that is right along the trail. My paced slowed down towards the end of the day as the trail included more rocky sections as I got closer to Duncannon. It was almost 8:30 when I stepped out of the woods and crossed the railroad tracks to begin the 2 mile road walk into town. As I walked across the bridge the river looked gorgeous as you can see in today's photo. I called the restaurant to make sure they would still be open when I got there but made the mistake of assuming the Doyle Hotel would be open until 10 pm. I went to the hotel first to check in just in case they did close at 10 pm but was surprised to find the place completely dark and locked up. The sign showed the hours as 11 am to 10pm? and I figured the question mark means that they close whenever the bar empties out. I used Yelp to find another hotel that was about 10 miles away and pulled up Uber to confirm that I could get a ride before grabbing dinner at the pizza place in town. The guy at the hotel gypped me out of a few bucks by adding $5 ""tax"" onto the $45 rate that he had quoted me over the phone. I don't mind paying tax but when I googled it I found that in PA its supposed to be 6% which is actually $2.70. This is such a small amount of money that it doesn't make sense to make a fuss about it. And when the owners son knocked on my door and offered to run me back into town in the morning for $5 I decided to let it go. I thought about it and realized that I'm either feeling worn out from the trail or that I'm having trouble dealing with the contrast of going home, or going to visit my granddaughter and hiking the trail. It usually takes me about 3 days to get back into the groove and to renew my love of hiking the AT. Tomorrow I'm going to shuttle 10 miles north of where I parked my car so that I can slack pack for the day.","Peters Mt Road

I also met Magic, a NOBO woman who said that she met me last year in Georgia. She made it up to Harpers Ferry last year and is now doing the top half of the trail. I wasn't too pleased to see all this graffiti when I crossed a power line late in the day. My guess is that once it gets started then other ""artists"" decide that it's ok to join in the fun. It seems so out of place here in the AT wilderness. I got back to my car in time to drive into Harrisburg to see the movie ""Money Monster"" as part of my strategy to nurture myself and hopefully get out of this funk...

I hiked up the trail a ways, found a campsite to spend the night and am warm and dry inside my tent now. In the morning I'll hike back to the car and catch a shuttle down to PA 325 which is where I started hiking yesterday.

I explained to her how I had started out thru hiking last year and how I had restarted this February in Erwin, TN which is the furthest north that I had made it last year. ""Oh, you're a Lasher"" she responded.""What's that?"" I asked.""It's a long ass section hiker"" she said. Hmm.. ok.. I thought.

He was nice enough to walk along with me at my slower pace for awhile. I used my method of asking open ended questions to get him talking while I scurried along behind him as we went up a few hills. This allows me to focus on my breathing while simultaneously slowing down the other hiker since they have to talk rather than take deep breaths. I didn't really feel like hiking today since I kept thinking about my visit with my granddaughter. I found myself asking ""What am I doing slogging along the trail?""I mentioned this to my Dad while talking with him and he suggested that I think about the trail as a special challenge - I agreed with him that I shouldn't mentally define my hike as ""slogging'""I ended up here at the Rausch Gap Shelter with four other serious 30 something NOBO hikers who all smelled as bad or worse than me.

I wanted to do what I could to help my legs feel better and also to find a way to come up with some more energy since I've feel like I've been dragging along the last few days. Since AWOLs guide didn't show any water ahead I filled up with my dinner water from the stream before heading off to hike under I-81 and then up the mountain to the tent site that I had picked out ahead of time on the map. I ran into an older SOBO hiker who told me that there was a small stream ahead that crossed the trail right as the AT headed up the mountain. Because of this I dumped out the extra water that I was carrying so that I wouldn't have to haul the extra weight for the next 2 or 3 miles - why not just get it at the stream, I thought. Right after crossing under I-81 the trail crossed a small cement drainage ditch and headed uphill. ""Is this the stream that he mentioned?"" I asked myself. ""It couldn't be.. or could it?""""It's probably full of all kinds of chemicals from the water that washes off the interstate highway."" I started hiking past it and then wondered what I would do if there wasn't actually a real stream ahead. So I turned around and walked the 50 steps back to the drainage ditch and filled up with water for dinner. I justified this to myself by thinking, ""It's just one day, and there can't be THAT much chemicals in a few liters of water.""After starting out hiking up the mountain I was happy to see a small stream crossing the trail after about 5 minutes. I dumped out my water for the second time that afternoon and refilled from the stream. ""Haha..""

The water here is on the opposite side of the shelter which is a little weird. There is one couple heading northbound who join me to get water and he shakes my hand before he heads out. I'm too slow to distract him with a bow or knuckle bump and end up shaking his hand in a reactionary habit. As soon as he walks away I'm getting out my soap to wash my hands since I don't know if he washes his hands or how many other grubby hikers he's shaken hands with lately. I met a SOBO hiker who looked like his pack weighed 70 or 80 pounds. He said that he thought it was about 40 pounds but that he hadn't weighed it. I was impressed that he wanted to make it at least 100 miles before accepting a trail name. ""I've only got 15 more miles to go"" he said. About a half hour later I met a SOBO hiker who said he had just seen a bear about 1/4 of a mile up the trail. I pulled my glasses out of my pack and listened and looked carefully for the next hour but didn't see the bear. Then my daughter, the one with the birthday, sent me a text with a bear walking in her backyard. I should probably mention that she lives in Anchorage, Alaska.

I've been worrying about rocks, asking other hikers about rocks, and wondering how the rocks will affect my foot. It turns out that the rocks are never as bad or as good as other people lead me to believe. They do slow me down a bit but unless they are really bad, they don't seem to affect my injured foot too much. I've decided that I'm going to enjoy hiking on the rocks... Well, as much as I can anyway.  The trail divided into 2 parts and then into 3 or 4 separate trails all headed in the same direction. It appears that this has been caused by the original trail getting too muddy, but it's interesting in that all 4 options appear to be hiked regularly so you have the choice of which lane you want to take.

He did really well getting a 1st in one race and 4th place in another race. I worry about him getting hurt but also realize that life is a series of tradeoffs. I found the slogan in today's photo in the journal at the Hostel and I've been thinking about this while hiking today. I have at times wished that I hadn't gone motorcycle racing and broken my hip. But when I think about this, I realize that I'm been living my dreams - and sometimes that means taking some chances. If I hadn't shattered my hip then I wouldn't be hiking the AT. And hiking the AT is another dream of mine that is now coming true... One rocky day at a time : ) I also thought about some of the other things that I want to do.. one of which is to get better at playing the piano. Ideally I'd like to find some way that I can play or perform for other people rather than just playing for my own pleasure. I asked Jodi and Craig at the Hostel if they had a piano, hinting that I might like to play it. They said they had one in their house but didn't offer to make it available. They'd probably say yes if I pushed it but they've been so nice with everything else that I don't want to push them on access to the piano.It's late and my foot is hurting from all the miles I hiked today.

I was able to go a little faster and catch up to him, which seemed really strange. The only hikers I've ever passed before were extremely out of shape people who were going up a steep hill. I finally caught up to this mystery man as he was slowly poking his way over a stream crossing. His name is Dr Fix-it, he's about 10 years older than me, and he's from Branson, Missouri. I got to talking with him and quickly realized that we had much in common. Hmmm... this guy hikes slow like me, we have fun stuff to talk about... maybe he'd be willing to hike with me for a day or two. We talked for the next 30 minutes or so and then came to Reservoir Rd which is where I would hike .3 miles down to where my car was parked.

We exchanged phone numbers and agreed to meet up the next day either on the trail or at Hawk Mt Rd which is in about 10 miles.

Next was another good breakfast including fresh cut fruit and orange juice. Ironman shuttled us up to Hawk Mt road which is where a serial killer named Mathias Schaumbacher lived in the 1800s. The old building he operated as an inn is still standing there and is currently used as a personal residence. Some of the travelers who came and stayed at the inn were never seen again. It turns out that on his death bed he confessed to killing over a dozen people and let people know where to find their remains in his well.

The blue blased trail ran paralell to the AT for about about 3/4 of a mile so we followed the blue blazes to the spring, got some of the cool water and contiuned on to meet up with the AT a bit further north. This, of course, is not purist AT hiking since we effectively skipped 3/4 of a mile of the AT. Before long the trail improved dramatically as the AT turned down an old fire road. The last few miles were smooth so I turned up my speed to a whopping 2 miles per hour which is still slower than most of the younger hikers roll along at. Before long we were back to the car, drove “home” to the Rock n Sole hostel and enjoyed a nice hot shower in preparation for dinner. Tonights meal was awesome (once again).

I’m hesitant to write this about someone who is willing to help hikers along the trail but if anyone was to come by this way I think you might want to know that this guy seems to have uh… issues. He talks non-stop in a slightly too loud voice while taking a pretty aggressive stance on most everything. Then there’s the fact that he brings his doberman along unless the car is packed completely full of hikers. When we stopped to drop a few other hikers off at the trailhead the doberman jumps out of the car and races up to another hiker growling and barked menacingly. The hiker impressed me when he says in a cool, matter of fact way, “Call off your dog or I’ll shoot it”So Mechanical man hollers at his dog who then runs away from the hiker and over to stick his snout in my pack and promptly gobbles down my breakfast sandwich. Very nice. Very nice. Once we drive off - and of course the other hiker can’t hear him, mechanical man says “That guy’s crazy. If you shoot my dog I’ll shoot you!” So I feel funny sharing this with you but quite frankly this was such an odd morning that I didn’t have any choice but to tell you all about it.I will say that I’m glad that Mechanical man is here to shuttle us (for a fee).

We drop my car at the north end of an 8 to 10 mile chunk of the trail and then shuttle to the south end to start our hike each day. When I mentioned this to my wife she said “Isn’t that cheating?” Slack packing is considered by some purist hikers to be a lazy hikers method but I haven’t heard anyone call it cheating yet.

I even saw multiple entries in some of the shelter journals where hikers used bad language to describe their Pennsylvania experience. What we found was that most hikers embellish their stories a little bit to make it sound a little worse than it really is. Then I would worry about a tough section that was coming up and end up making it harder or rockier somehow in my head before getting there. The best advice I got was from my Dad who suggested thinking of it as a big challenge. This worked so much better than just hiking along hating the rocks.

So we found a place to camp along the ridge that looked out to the east over a beautiful body of water. I'll have to find out what it's called and update this at a later date. We found a couple of rocks to sit on while we made our dinners. I marveled at the ingenuity that doctor fix it had put into creating his own tiny little alcohol fuel stove, titanium pot, homemade cozy that keeps the food warm - all of which weighs next to nothing. He spent quite a while planning researchIng and getting ready for his hike. It shows when you take a close look at his gear. It's nice to be here in my tent although I appear to be on a slight sidehill tonight.Thanks so much for following my journey. I really appreciate your interest.","Delaware Water Gap

What a great way to start a day of hiking.We hiked along throughout the day occasionally hitting some rocky sections and some very smooth nice areas of trail. There were several places where I had to struggle clamoring up some rocks because the steps that were cut out were only big enough for a toehold. My left foot is not yet strong enough to be able to hold on just by the toe - I need to put half my foot on a step to use it as a place to push off of.  We planned on hiking tonight down to a stream where we would have water to make dinner. However, about a mile and a half before we reached the stream Dr. fix-it realized that we were up higher along the ridge where there was a slight breeze and he thought there would be less mosquitoes. He explained that mosquitoes like to be around water, and they also tend to be more prevalent at lower elevations. I had never known this however the sound of less mosquitoes sounded perfect to me so we went ahead and camped up on the ridge.Dr. fix it had some extra water that he gave me so that I had was able to make my dinner of macaroni and cheese with some mashed potatoes mixed in. His prediction proved to be true as I have not seen a single mosquito here yet.I hope you have a great day and thank you very much for following along on my adventure.","Campsite at Mile 1302

It was a little over 7 miles to get there so we figured we'd have a late lunch, an early dinner, or maybe both. I stopped to rest and dry out some my gear in the morning sun and Dr Fix-it continued up the trail. He sent me a text 30 minutes later saying that he had slipped and fallen on some wet rocks. He said he was ok but warned me to be careful. By 2 pm I had caught up to the Dr and we made our way down the hill in anticipation of reaching the deli. When we got there the deli was out of beeswax. That's what I call a place that's gone out of business. I don't recall when or where I picked up this phrase but my kids all know what I mean when I use it. Anyway... no deli. We walked a little further to check out the steak house. Can you believe it? It's out of beeswax too. ""All I know is that I'm getting something to drink at the gas station"" said Dr Fix-it. Unfortunately when got there it actually sold gas and that's it. I can't remember the last time I saw a gas station without a convenience store. Oh well... We walked down a little further and found a bar called The Gap Tavern. They had signs up instructing hikers to walk around back rather than use the front door. At this point I was thrilled to find a place with food and drink that was open and still in business. I didn't mind that I was one of the stinky hikers who's asked to go around back. It turns out that about a dozen other hikers were sitting on the patio looking out over a gorgeous lake. We filled upon fries, a burger, and a pizza along with three refills of our drinks. To complete the day we hiked about a mile uphill and another mile along the ridge before arriving at the campsite you see here in today's photo. I used the picnic table here to make some hot chocolate while enjoying the view of blue ridges that are off to the west. This is my 12th day of hiking without taking a zero! This is a new world record for me. I think that Dr Fix-it helps keep me motivated and also helps to rein in any stupid ideas I may have such as trying to hike too far beyond my abilities in one day's time. By the way, that world record thing comes from growing up with three brothers. We ice skated on a rink our Dad made for us in the backyard, played field hockey, and ping pong. Most games turned highly competitive at some point and concluded in a ""world championship"" even though it was just the four of us.

We decided to rest for a moment and eat an early lunch. Just as we sat down the sky opened up and it poured down raining like crazy. We enjoyed staying dry while watching the rain continue to pour down while we ate our lunch. Within several minutes of finishing lunch the rain stopped and we joked about how perfect our timing was to be in under cover while it was raining."" I sure wouldn't want to be caught out in a tremendous downpour like that"", I said.We continued on hiking through the day working our way over a never ending series of ledge rock that the trail was routed upon. It was like walking along in gymnastics class from one balance beam to the next. At about 5:30 I commented to Dr. fix it saying ""it seems to be getting dark early today, doesn't it?""Then we heard the sound of thunder. Within another few minutes just as we were starting to traverse down a series of small cliffs the skies opened up and the rain came down three times as hard as it was in the morning. I'm talking cats and dogs, frogs and toads, catfish and salmon!We got completely drenched as we worked our way down the face of the exposed cliffs. I was walking down the trail below the cliff and the water was rushing down the trail so furiously it washed right over everything including my hiking boots. I gave up trying to keep any semblance of staying dry and sloshed along through the middle of the mud puddles for the rest of the day.One bit of happiness occurred as we walked out of the woods 45 minutes early for our shuttle we noticed that Kenny, our incredibly responsible shuttle driver was just pulling into the lot. So we jumped in his car and waited anxiously while he slowly drove the hour and a half back to Delaware water gap where we had left my car four days earlier. We topped off the day by checking into a super eight hotel and hanging our gear up in all the positions you can see in today's photograph. Then we went out to Friendly's had milkshakes and a couple sandwiches before going to Walmart to resupply some of our food.I know that's quite a bit to have happen in one day but that's what life is like on the Appalachian Trail you never know when you're going to have a tremendously huge adventurous day or just a tiny little bit of adventure in a day.Thanks so much for reading this.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537188,"We packed up all of our gear this morning at the super eight and headed out to a local Outfitter to get a new pair of hiking poles for Dr. fix it. His old pair had developed a strange clicking sound which even he was unable to fix despite much pounding with a rock on the side of the trail. It turns out that they had poles not for Dr. fix it but for me! I've been looking for a pole with a larger handle since I tend to put a large amount of my weight on my hands to help me make it down hills. The top of the new hiking pole looks sort of like a cane but other then not looking cool it seems to meet my needs exactly. Dr. Fix it is using my old Leki brand poles and offered to buy them from me. I told him they were worth more since they were already broken in. He said they weren't in too bad shape for being used. I'll probably just give them to him. Note to my beautiful wife: The new poles were only $20 each and might just keep my hands from being permanantly clenched. Well worth it even for a hiker who's on a modest budget : ) Next we went to a bank so I could get some cash to spend for expenses along the trail After that we found a place in the mall that could measure me for a tux. It turns out my oldest daughter is getting married on July 2 and I needed to be measured for the tux I will wear at her wedding in Colorado.Finally we went to a diner and had lunch since we are hungry hikers. It seems any hiker who is close to any type of restaurant will always go in and order at least one meal just in case they need extra calories for the trail.We finally headed up to High Point State Park and we're planning on leaving the car there and hiking north. However, we found a ridge runner, thats a guy who basically is paid to hike the trail and talk to Hikers and provide guidance or advice. The ridge runner was willing to shuttle me north about 30 miles so we could leave the car there and hike back to it over the next three days.While driving me back he told me a funny story about a time when a bear grabbed his backpack that was leaning up against the outside of his tent and ran off with it including everything in his pack and even his drivers license and credit cards.Because of all this running around this morning we finally started hiking at about 330 pm and we only did 7 miles. My oldest daughter will say Dad, only 7 miles, that's great. Well thank you honey I appreciate it. We stayed at the Jim Murray private shelter which is a little retreat right off the trail. There's a water spigot to refill your canteen, showers, and one of the nicest shelters I've seen anywhere on the trail. It even has electricity inside.We decided to stay in our tents even though the shelter looked really cool. So I'm in my tent now and I can hear a little bit of rain coming down.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537242,"We slept in until 7:30 this morning and noticed that the four other tents of hikers were already on the trail. A quick two miles over easy trail took us into a road crossing near Unionville, NY. The trail crosses the NJ-NY border for the next few days but won't officially take us into NY until we cross the Hudson River. So at the road Dr Fixit says ""Let's walk the 1/2 mile over to the deli""Now, I have to tell you that I hate bonus miles like this. I avoid them like the plague because they wear me out and especially because they don't count toward the 2,189 Appalachian Trail miles. Hiking with a partner requires concessions so I said ""Fine, lets go. ""So as we walk into Horlers Store and deli Dr Fixit starts saying hello and talking with the lady there. I like that about him because I can just be mostly quiet and then get to watch what happens. So he goes right into this story about a place where you could order off the menu or you could take the chefs challenge. ""The chef had a pretty good pantry,"" he's explaining to this lady we just met 30 seconds ago, ""and he'll make you anything at all you want for $75. In fact, if he can't make it he'll pay you $200. The waitress said. """"Ok, I'll have the elephant trunk roast with lettuce and tomatoe on rye."" Says Dr Fixit, telling the story. "" A minute later the waitress walks out and puts two hundred dollar bills on the table.""""Couldn't do it, huh."" Says the man""Nope, I was really surprised"" replies the waitress. ""This is the first time I've ever seen him out of rye bread. "" So then everyone laughs and we ordered our food. As it turns out the food was really good and my leg didn't even mind the extra mile so it was worth it. The funny thing is that hiking along today I start to remember the story as if the deli we went to really did have elephant trunk roast. At about 5 pm the sky darkened and the wind picked up. I suggested putting our tents up to avoid getting wet in the rain. ""OK,"" said Dr Fixit, ""Here's a campsite right over here."" At first I thought he was reacting too quickly but then I heard thunder and felt the first drops of rain. Both of us whipped our tents up in like 30 seconds. We were inside of them with just one pole up laughing at the situation but managing to stay dry. Within 15 or 20 minutes the storm had passed and we packed up to continue hiking. I told Dr Fixit that he had created too much funny material for my journal today and he promised to taper it down a bit in the future. It was a nice hike today which included getting water from an abandoned house near the trail. We are camped in an unofficial site and Dr Fixit just got his bear bag rope stuck way up in a tree. I'll have to tell you how he did it another day. By the way, my leg feels good tonight. The Appalachian Trail is healing me.","Murray private shelter and camping area

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537269,"My alarm went off at 5:30 this morning and I surprised myself by actually getting up. I told Dr. fix it that I needed a little bit of time to finish writing in my journal to you and he went back to sleep asking me to wake him up when I was done. About an hour later we got moving out of the tents and started hiking by 7 AM. We walked along a series of wooden boardwalks as you can see in today's photo through a wildlife preserve. I had just sat down to take a break when my oldest daughter, the one that's getting married at the beginning of next month, called me for some advice about a business lease she was getting ready to sign. I enjoyed talking with her and really appreciate the fact that I'm able to stay connected with my kids, share my life and adventures like the Appalachian Trail with them, and hopefully give them some tips on how to live a happier life. After about 4 miles of hiking we came to a road crossing at which point I asked Dr. fix it ""does this road have food?"" Which is kind of a joke because any road will lead you to food if you go far enough on it. Luckily for us just 800 feet up there was a place called Heaven Hill Farm which had really good apple cider, coffee, and donuts. We knew it was supposed to rain and maybe even hail today so we took a look at the storm coming in and decided to shuttle from here and move our car North while it was raining rather than hiking out into a pending storm. So that's what we're doing right now is waiting for the shuttle.Oh yeah, I was gonna tell you about the bear bag incident last night. Dr. fix it is really funny how he has his own way of doing everything and also kind of amazing how the methods he's developed are really cool and work very well. This applies to something as simple as putting up a bear bag. He has something he calls the Pacific Coast Trail method where he throws a rope over an extremely high limb, pulls the bag up in the air and somehow put a stick in the line which keeps the bear bag up in the air without having to tie it to another tree.The advantage of this is some of the Bears around here have gotten rather smart and they've learned that if they smell food they can go around and scratch at all of the trees nearby and eventually end up breaking the rope causing the food bag to come down. With Dr. fix its method they can't do anything except maybe try and pull on the rope which is impossible for them to do with their big bear hands. So as I looked over last night, Dr. fix it it had taken a rock, put it into his carefully prepared Cuban fiber bear bag rope bag which he had handcrafted at home and probably uses for for five other purposes as well. Then he somehow managed to toss this thing higher in the air than I've seen some fireworks go. I don't know how he managed to do it because he told me the rope was only 45 feet long but he hooked the bag over the limb of a tree which must've been at least 75 feet high. Then his lightweight rock bag wrapped around the limb and got stuck.He pulled on it for a while before giving up and melaconly walking over to his tent to start getting dinner ready lamenting that he had lost his favorite bear bag rope. Once I had my tent up I went over to give it a try myself. After pulling on it for five or 10 minutes with no success whatsoever I was ready to give up myself. Finally I pulled all the slack down and then put a loop in the rope and carefully managed to step up with my good leg (of course) into the loop and thrust all of my bodyweight down through the loop and into the rope. The tree limb reluctantly let go and Dr. fix it's beloved bear bag rope came rocketing down to the ground. ""Oh thank you thank you flash 52 - I can't believe you retrieved my rope"" said the relieved Dr. fix it. So that's the story about the bear bag incident anyway. I hope you can see now why I didn't want to get into this yesterday. We plan on hiking back out this afternoon after we move my car further north. I hope you're having a great day and staying warm and dry matter no what you're doing today. Update: We avoided the rain storm today with perfection. It rained like crazy while moving the car and shuttling back. The rain stopped right before we got back so we hiked another 5 miles to reach the shelter where we've put up our tents for the night.

That last bit about the money is a joke but sometimes it's hard to tell with some of the stories Dr Fix-it tells me as we're hiking along. For instance, a tree fell down last night by the shelter and the Dr told two women who were scared by this a story that made them feel better while also proving the existence of a legendary creature.

We got up at the motel and realized that the taxi service didn't start running again until four in the afternoon. It was about 4 miles to get back to the trail and we didn't know what to do.We eventually found a nice guy named Mike who offered to give us a ride in his car. He helped out at the local church and seemed like a very nice guy. His car was older and a bit beat up though. I had to reach over to open his door from the inside since the outside door handle was broken, and the mirror on my side of the car was broken and all taped to the side of the car with duct tape. I tried putting my seatbelt on but it did not work either. As we drove down the road the seatbelt signal started beeping reminding me to put my belt on. Mike said ""can you please do something with that -that's driving me crazy!"" I kept trying to shove the seatbelt in but for some reason it would not go into the latch. Mike suggested just to hold the buckle in as best as I could and that would stop the noise. However the noise continued and Mike repeatedly reminded me that he was going nuts listening to the seatbelt buzzer.When he went to turn left into the hotdog stand parking lot where he was going to drop us off , Just as he turned a car came around the corner and was barreling straight at the side at my side of the car. Dr. fix it shouted out a warning yell and right before the car smashed into us Mike stomped on the gas and the car leapt into a big pothole in the hotdog stand parking lot bouncing to a dusty stop. We quickly and gratefully got out while thanking Mike for the ride and the exciting start to our day. The trail was nice in places today and in other places routed us over and on ledges like it has the past few days. There are also four or five places today where we had to climb up over rocks and even take off our packs at one point. There was one rather steep climb which appeared to be a new reroute, so the trail was not well worn in and was not at all obvious where to go or where to climb. We were climbing over a very steep ridge and I was holding onto some tree roots with my hands. I then inched up with my knee to get it up on a rock below me when I realized that I was stuck. I could not go any further up and I could not get back down either. I stayed there for a few minutes mentally dealing with the fear in my head. I was reassured to know that Dr. fix it was 20 or 30 feet down below me also making his way up the trail.It was then that I heard the reassuring voice of Dr Fix-it. ""It's like a staircase except you have many more options"" he suggested. This helped me to relax, take a breath and realize that -yes - I could move around, wiggle a little bit and find some more options. I finally found a way to get one of my feet onto a rock below me so I had something to push off of and I was able to get out of this tricky predicament.We're now camping up on a ridge in an attempt to stay away from mosquitoes however they've been biting me.

The entire area is long thin grasses and has a park like setting, actually it is a park so no surprise there. The top was jammed with people due to the road that provides access to the public. A vending machine charged me $20 for a soda and my credit card company caught the error. They insisted on cancelling my credit card which is a bit of a hassle.

After reading AWOLs book about taking his wife out for a 21 mile first day I made sure to keep the distance short. Joanna admitted later that she felt she had her fill of hiking about 1.5 miles into the 4.5 mile day today.We stopped by the river to rest for a bit and Joanna took the opportunity to sit and enjoy the experience of being right by the water. For some reason by the time we got back to the bed and breakfast, I was completely wiped out. To deal with this issue, I took a 2 or 3 hour nap before dinner.

By the time we finished breakfast and got back to the trail it was past 10:30 am. Cheddar's parents had set up some trail magic to congratulate their son on finishing his thru hike. I'm not sure how he ended up finishing in this spot, but it was nice to see the effort that was put into recognizing his achievement. I wanted to eat some of the food they provided but was too stuffed from the baked french toast that I had filled up on at the bed and breakfast.The trail took us uphill today in the heat - probably not a great idea to start a day like this so late in the morning but that's what we did. I've discovered that I don't have much energy when it's hot which caused me to move along at a snails pace. Today is Father's day and (almost... ) all of my kids called to say ""Hi"". I really enjoyed hearing from each of them and appreciated having a reason to sit down and rest while talking with them. Because of the late start, the heat, and the Father's day phone calls we didn't do too well on mileage today. Dr Fix-it said ""This is just one day out of many and it's ok to have some shorter days"". It's interesting how he is able to help keep me focused on the positive aspects of our hike. Well, we're camped in our tents here near the shelter and just finished making dinner. There wasn't a picnic table here so we sat on a log and talked with two other thru hikers who are going to knock out 17 miles tomorrow. One of them said that he might have a hard time ""staying focused"" if he was only covering the 10 to 12 miles that we are doing each day. At times I'm quite content to plug along at our slower pace and at other times it bothers me to hear how other hikers are going much faster. For some reason this guys comment bothered me.

It was only about 80 degrees but the humidity must have been high today. We stopped for a 1.5 hour mid day siesta and I hung my shirt out in the sun to dry. Within an hour or so of restarting my shirt which had completely dried out was soaking wet again. The afternoon got easier with about 5 miles of flat, smooth trail along the Housatonic River. Despite this my thoughts were along the lines of ""What the heck am I doing out here?""""I could be home taking it easy.""""This trail is starting to look all the same.""I was ready to call it quits today. I was feeling hot, tired and worn out. I tried to remind myself that any long journey like this must include days like today.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539629,"It felt great to get up early this morning and start hiking by 6:30 am. I wanted to get some miles in before it heats up too much today. We packed up our stuff using the countertop that was under the pavilion... more on this in a bit... and then headed off Northward up the trail. Supposedly on the summer solstice, which is today, hikers on the AT go through the day without any clothes on. Dr Fix-it and I talked about this as a possibility over the past few days however I noticed when we left camp this morning that both of us were fully dressed. ""Excuse me.. Naked hiker coming up behind you"" said the voice behind me.""I just didn't want to surprise you"" a thru hiker named Top Knot explained as he walked past.""Way to play full out"" I said, trying to come up with an appropriate compliment. He DID have a sock tied on in a strategic location that looked really super funny to me for some reason. It turns out that this was the only naked hiker today out of the 8 or 10 people I saw. Now I know that the stories I've heard about the summer solstice are at least partly true. Later in the day Dr Fix-it sent me a text saying that he was missing his tent and his food bag. ""Not in my pack - keep your eyes out"" I stopped to put my glasses on so that I'd have a better chance of seeing his camo tent bag somewhere along the side of the trail. I couldn't figure out how in the world his tent and food bag could have jumped up and out of his pack, even if it was undone at the top. ""Maybe your tent came out when you slipped and fell this morning"" I texted ahead to him a few hours later. ""No, I left it at the campsite this morning"" was his reply. Actually, his reply included about 10 sad crying faces - so I could tell that he was upset about this. It was a really nice tent, a Zpacks Duplex just like mine except that it was the camo color rather than blue like mine. I called him and tried to cheer him up by assuring him that we could go back and get it. ""No, it's gone by now"" he responded. It turns out Hudson, the owner of the hostel we are at tonight was very helpful in looking for the tent. Even though he thought a nice tent like this would be quickly taken by another hiker, he drove us around to check the various trailheads and other spots where another hiker may have brought the tent to leave it for its owner. Hudson even drove to the road which was about 3/4 of a mile downhill from the campsite. He grabbed his headlamp and sprinted up the trail looking like a white tailed deer. Within less than 30 minutes he was back with bad news... no tent, or food bag. Dr Fix-its food bag also had his really cool homemade alcohol stove and super light titanium cook pot in it. The funny thing about this is that we always try to double check for items left behind by doing a final look around. Dr Fix-it said that he did this today but that he looked on the ground rather than on the counter in the pavilion. If both of us had done a decent ""final look"" I think we would have probably caught his error and avoided losing his tent.He's sent an email to Zpacks to see if they might be able to replace his tent without the usual 6 week lead time to buy another tent. By the way, the hostel here at Bearded Woods Bunk and Dine is awesome. Clean beds, shower, laundry, delicious food, and Hudson is a walking encyclopedia on the AT having thru hiked it before.","Silver Hill Campsite

If you'd like to see some of these videos you can find them on Youtube by searching for ""flash 52 thru hike"" or on ""Secrets to a successful hike"". It was interesting to see the power plant along with part of an old turbine which was attached to one of the signs along the trail. I sent the photo of the substation to Slipknot, a thru hiker I met early this year, since he used to work for the power company in Vermont. I was feeling much better today.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539638,"Today we slack packed again deciding to head South up over Bear Mountain so we would ascend the extremely steep face rather than coming down it. This takes more energy to climb going this way but is somewhat safer to go up rather than down a steep section like this. I decided to try hiking without my elevate foot drop brace today. This is a device which helps to hold my left foot up so that I don't trip on it. The muscles in my foot are slowly getting stronger as I recover from my injury 3.5 years ago. The brace also limits how far my foot can move which helps to avoid excessive strain on it. We hiked over quite a few ledge type rocks this morning. That's what I called the glacier scraped dolomite rocks, many of which look like a whales back. These rocks don't have many flat places that I can put my foot down on so by mid day my foot was starting to really hurt. ""Why don't you put your brace back on"" Dr Fix-it suggested. ""Great Idea"" I responded. You see, I had been thinking about putting my brace back on but for some reason I didn't. I don't know if it was that I just didn't want to stop or what. I can be pretty bull headed that way for some reason. Then, when someone like Dr Fix-it suggests an obvious solution, somehow the ""I'll just keep going"" part of me shuts up and common sense has a chance to prevail. My foot really did feel much better this afternoon : ) As we headed downhill today I looked out at the Connecticut countryside and felt a cool breeze coming up the mountain. I just stood there trying to take a few minutes to soak in this experience. I've discovered that I can take a photo or video but there's something ethereal about moments like this that can't be captured. I know that as much as I try to save this experience in my head, I can only enjoy it fully right now, right here, today. I want to live all of my life like this.

I dropped Dr Fix-it off at the North end and then drove down to the South end of our hike today to reach the point where we finished up hiking yesterday. We spent last night camped out behind Toymaker's cafe, a hiker friendly breakfast place in town. Dr Fix-it was able to get Zpacks to sell him another tent. It turns out that they had one on hand that had a slight blemish in color so he didn't have to wait the usual 6 weeks time to get another tent. I offered to let him use the one person tent that I have. It's the tent I used last year - lightweight but rather small. He was concerned about being able to fit in it so I offered to sleep in the small tent and let him use my Zpacks, the same version of tent he had before leaving it behind forever at the Silver Hill Campsite the other day. ""Oh, no, I'll be fine"" he said. I had just settled down for the night when I heard the Dr say ""Hey Flash, I'm wearing the tent""I guess it was a pretty tight squeeze. He said that his head and his feet hit the ends and that his face would hit the sides unless he looked straight up. This morning he found an inexpensive hostel where we can stay for the next few days until he gets his replacement tent. The Dr didn't sleep well last night for some reason and didn't enjoy his day but today was a great hike for me. Water was somewhat scarce - at one point today I was eyeing a cow trough considering wether or not I should filter some of the water out of it!I decided to skip the cow trough and came across some great trail magic - Water in gallon jugs - that Dr Fix-it had seen while hiking South.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539679,"Dr Fix-it was feeling worn out yesterday so we decided to take a zero today. The spiritual retreat place we are staying at is interesting. Most people who come to the retreat pay $30 a day to stay there while not talking or making any noise. No meals or instruction of any kind is provided so attendees need to purchase and cook their own meals. This seems like an easy way to run a business... you just provide clean beds and linens, and you don't have to even talk with anyone. I'm probably missing something because to me it seems kinda funny... As thru hikers we get a better deal - $10 a night for a shower and a mattress with clean sheets on the floor. Everything here is thread bare. The washer and dryer is broken and the towels have holes in them. Despite this it's quite clean and the owner even talks to us! Just another chapter in our Appalachian Trail adventure. It felt great to sleep in today until 9 am rather than waking up at my traditional hiking time of 5:30 am. On the way to breakfast we picked up a hiker from Holland named Oompa who was heading into town. He joined us for breakfast and we had a good time learning about his country. Since it was almost impossible to make room for Oompa to sit in the back seat of the car we decided to clean out the car. It's gotten so full of hiking stuff that I can't seem to find things when I'm looking for them. We found a place next to a dumpster, pulled everything out, organized things and created a pile of trash to go in the dumpster. Dr Fix-it went inside to ask permission to use the dumpster and when he came out he told me to back up the car and get ready to tear out. He can keep a pretty straight face when he's pulling my leg, so good in fact that I can't tell when he's kidding me. I'm pretty sure the guy in the business said it was fine to use the dumpster but I was still looking over my shoulder to see if someone was going to come running out and yell at us. That's the thing with Dr Fix-it. He's always got something going on. For example, yesterday when I got to the car he said that he added a new feature to my Honda accord while he was waiting for me. He said he changed the wiring so that if I turned the key in the door three times in a row the windows would go down. ""Sure they will"" I responded. I mean, I don't think he really did anything with the wiring and I've owned this car for over ten years. If there was some trick like this I would surely know about it. So then later, when he wasn't watching, I tried it and presto - all 4 windows go down just like he said. I just don't know what to think. The interesting thing is that Dr Fix-it keeps me guessing. Since I like surprises that's probably a good thing.Hobbling around town today I have a hard time believing that I'm out hiking the Appalachian Trail. Back at it tomorrow. Oh yea.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540775,"For the most part it's hard to get lost while hiking the Appalachian Trail. It's marked with painted white blazes in most sections well enough that you'll usually see a blaze every five minutes or so. I've learned from the few times I've walked off the trail to, when in doubt, first look back over my shoulder to perhaps find a Southbound facing blaze. If this doesn't confirm that I'm on the trail I might walk at most another few minutes in hopes of seeing another blaze. If I don't see a trail marking within 3 or 4 minutes then I'll usually turn around and backtrack until I'm able to see a white blaze. In most cases I'm able to quickly determine that yes, I'm on the trail, or see where I inadvertently went astray. Other hikers, or trail maintainers will often place small logs or branches across the ""wrong"" path to help keep people on the AT. Despite this I've stepped right over such diversions because I was daydreaming or simply not watching closely enough. Gerry Largay stepped off the trail to go to the bathroom in rugged territory in Maine while thru hiking in 2013. She couldn't find her way back to the trail and decided to hike up to higher ground to try and get a cell phone signal. She holed up in her tent awaiting rescue but eventually died after depleting her food supplies. I use an app called Guthook which provides a GPS enabled map for those occasions when a quick backtrack doesn't get me back on the trail. Amazingly it works even without a cell phone signal - showing my position and the route of the nearby trail. So this morning I was hiking along past an overlook where Dr Fixit was making one of his videos when the trail hooked back in the direction I had just come from. I was surprised to see that the trail looped back into the path I had just walked by about 5 minutes earlier. The AT was taking me in a circle! Feeling quite lost, I checked the Guthook app, hiked around the circle another time for good measure, and finally found where the trail went downhill past the viewpoint. So yes, I do admit to getting lost, but only for a short time. This brings me to the most interesting part of today's hike. We had arranged with a shuttle driver to pick us up at the AT trailhead on Beartown Mountain Rd. We'd left the car at the trailhead near Great Barrington when we started hiking this morning. We kept things lightweight by slack packing with just water, a raincoat, and lunch. Well, we made it to Beartown Mountain Rd but our shuttle driver wasn't there. After waiting 15 or 20 minutes Dr fixit hiked back up the hill on the trail to see if he could get a cell phone signal. I checked the guidebook and was surprised to see that there were actually two different places that the AT crosses Beartown Mountain Rd. Our driver was likely at the other crossing which was about 5 trail miles South of us. Dr Fixit connected with our shuttle driver and, because he seemed somewhat confused, gave him turn by turn directions to get to us. It was something like ""go straight ahead, turn left on this road, then left again on Beartown Mountain Rd. (It turns out there were actually two separate roads with the same name) I stayed down on the road and Dr Fixit was up on the hill in case the driver tried calling us back. Our driver was about 10 minutes away, but ten minutes came and went. We waited, and waited, and waited. Since we were slack packing we didn't have our tents, sleeping bags, pads, or even dinner with us for that matter. I had a couple protein bars and the Dr had one granola bar. We could have hiked back about a mile and slept in a shelter however the idea of sleeping on the wooden floor of the shelter without a sleeping pad or any covers didn't sound too appealing to either one of us. I could have sat down on a rock but for some reason I chose to stand out in the middle of the road looking forlornly in the direction I expected to see our shuttle driver arriving from. I kept thinking he'd be there any minute but I just kept waiting and waiting. I should have seen that there were two roads with the same name in the guide book. I should have chosen a bigger road rather then the dusty, remote gravel road that I found myself standing on. It was past eight o'clock when I finally heard a vehicle approaching. A shiny new van with an older looking driver pulled up to a stop. He looked over at me with a stupefied grin on his face.""I can't believe I made it"" the driver said. ""It's a miracle!"" ""I was going to keep driving until dark and then I was going to go home"" he said. I hollered for Dr Fixit to come down the hill and started loading my poles and pack into the van. It quickly became apparent that ""Joel"" was brand new to the shuttle business, didn't know where the trail heads were, nor could he navigate easily or follow the simple directions we had given him. 
The most amazing thing of all was that he was using - (I'm not making this up) - an AT wall map, the one that shows Georgia to Maine to try and find us on a mountain road. The state of Massachusetts is about 4 inches wide on that map! 
Dr fixit said jokingly that perhaps he should get Joel a globe to navigate with. We just checked into a Days Inn to try and regain some sense of certainty.","Great Barrington, MA

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540842,"We had planned on moving the car up to Dalton this morning and then shuttling back down to BearMountain Rd to continue our Northbound trek. As we drove North we left a few messages for various shuttle drivers making certain of course to avoid Joel, the driver who almost left us stranded in the woods last night. In hindsight, it would have been better to line up a shuttle yesterday. It was past 10 am when we arrived at the trailhead in Dalton so we decided to hike South today which would give us more time to get a shuttle lined up. So we’ll hike about 10 miles today which leaves a chunk of trail that’s two days hiking length to fill in between where we’ll stop tonight and where we left off further South yesterday. I don’t really like to hike Southward if I can avoid it and I detest “hiking ahead” like this - I get confused spatially by doing this. I’ve got a picture of the trail going up through the states and mixing things up like this makes it harder for me to visualize myself like a little ant crawling up the wall map. We met Rabbit, a NOBO that I remembered seeing down in Virginia at the Four Pines Hostel. He was surprised that I could recall that far back on the trail but I seem to have a way with remembering faces. He shared with us how he’d recently gotten Lyme’s Disease and had to take a break to heal up. You can check out his adventures by looking up his blog here on Trail Journals. I stopped at an auto repair shop to use the bathroom and ended up talking with the owner about doing some work on my car. The brakes have been squeaking for way too long and he specializes in Hondas. When he said he was willing to run up to the trailhead to fetch the car I decided to have him work on it while we hiked today. I hiked up to a field today with the brightly colored little house on wheels that you can see in today’s photo. As I walked up there was one goat standing just outside the little house with a second goat looking out the door. The goat looked at me and said “baaaa” and I responded with my very best goat imitation. Within seconds all of the goats you can see came pouring out of the little house to come over and check me out. It would have made a good video if I was ready in time with my phone. It was a nice hike today with mostly gentle uphills that I try to convince myself don’t count as hills since they don’t get my heart rate up. My new inexpensive hiking poles with the cane type handles I like are giving out already. The baskets are broken, the carbide tips are mostly worn down, and the shock absorbers broke so they click-clack with every step. Dr Fixit said that Leki makes a cane grip version so I ordered a pair from Amazon. It’s beyond me how he knows so much about everything but it does come in handy to have a hiking partner like this. We are settled into our tents at the cookie lady’s house which is where we ended up our hike today. She’s been busy looking after her husband who fell and broke his hip recently and although we didn’t get any cookies, it’s great to be able to camp out in her yard. By the way, since the Dr hasn’t gotten his replacement tent yet I’m in my one person tent tonight and yes, it’s a pretty tight fit. I can see how having a slightly larger tent is a real asset to maintaining my sanity on the trail. Thanks so much for following along with me on my adventure!","Gulf Rd

We started out this morning heading North from Beartown Mountain Rd with a goal of getting to the Upper Goose Pond Cabin.I forgot to pack my lunch and snacks for tomorrow but I think I’ll be ok because I hear that we can get pancakes and coffee for breakfast from the caretaker at the Upper Goose Pond Cabin in the morning. Perhaps I can eat a few extra pancakes in the hopes of making it without a lunch. Dr Fixit has been teasing me about being my sherpa. He offered to carry my two person tent along in case the cabin was full tonight. In addition to this he offered to pack my cookstove since he lost his stove along with his tent the other day. The Dr usually brings some extra food so I’ll probably get a food bar or two from him to make it through the day tomorrow. He also has a really nice first aid kit, so all I carry is a few bandages. So as we’re hiking along today the Dr is adding up everything that he’s “carrying for me.” He includes the old hiking poles of mine that he’s using (Says he’s got the tent poles for me) and even mentions the duct tape wrapped around the top of the poles.This afternoon I caught up to Dr Fixit when he was taking a break and hiked down the trail ahead of him. I’ve discovered that for some reason I prefer to be out front. It must be my competitive nature or something. “I’m going to catch you when you stop to relieve yourself” taunted the Dr as I headed down the hill. “In fact, you probably have to go now… “ he added. “Your bladder is getting really full, isn’t it.” “Is that a rushing waterfall that I can hear just ahead… ?” The funny thing is that his suggestive powers were working on me. I waited until the trail narrowed through an area with bushes on both sides, then stopped in the middle of the path to go. To further enforce my “No passing” zone I turned uphill spraying back and forth like a lawn sprinkler so that there was no way the Dr could get by me. Then I hear him say “Hi, this is Dr Fixit here on the Appalachian Trail” (I look up to see him taking a video) “and this is Flash 52 blocking the trail”Ha ha. I don’t think he was really taking a video, at least I sure hope not. Well anyway, we made it to the Upper Goose Pond Cabin in time to get bunks for both of us.

We met a lady this morning at the Goose Pond Shelter that was getting off the trail because her knees were hurting so much. Dr Fixit pointed out the oversized knee brace that I wear and came up with this tale about how I went to see a doctor about my knee. “There’s no question about it, if you keep hiking then your leg will probably fall off” He quotes the imaginary doctor warning me. Then he adds for good measure “The worst part is now I have to carry dry ice to keep his leg fresh if it does fall off.” Now this gal is looking at me wondering if MY story is true and of course I’m expected to play along with it. I simply give her a smile, wish her best of luck and turn to head up the trail.We drove to Albany, NY tonight where I got us a great deal on a hotel using hotwire.com. In the morning I’m flying to Denver to see my oldest daughter get married! Dr fixit had told me that he was going to fly home for a few days while I was gone and then come back to continue his hike towards Maine with me. Something must have changed as he’s packed up every bit of his gear and offered to let me have his left over trail food since “I’m probably not coming back.”This isn’t really a big deal… what I mean is, I’ve hiked most of the trail by myself and can continue to do so, but it’s hit me as quite a surprise that the Dr isn’t going to keep hiking with me. I think the biggest reason is that he’s made dozens of comments over the past few weeks like “I just bought a replacement tent, so now I’ll have to go all the way to Maine with you.” or “I got a non-refundable ticket back to Albany so I’m definetly coming back.” In hindsight, all these comments should have given me some kind of idea that maybe, must maybe, the good Dr might be wavering about continuing his hike. The problem is that he jokes so much that I can’t tell when he’s really saying something or if he’s just making something up to be funny. He is pretty darn funny.

So I was surprised in a good way by the freshly made, stuffed with blueberry muffins this morning. I ate as many as I could without looking like a total hog. I used the take 2 or 3 at a time, but don’t take the last one technique. After filling up on muffins I ordered an egg, cheese and bacon sandwich to take with me on the trail today. A Southbounder yesterday was complaining about how steep his climb up to the lodge was and I thought he was being wimpy. I discovered that he wasn’t kidding - The terrain was pretty steep and long coming down from Mt Greylock. Before long I came to a sign marking the Massachusetts Vermont border. I can't believe that I've made it to Vermont and feel like I should be really excited. I'm mostly just tired. The best part of the day was after hiking through North Adams an AT friendly resident had a water hose with a sign that said “For AT hikers”. I sprayed cool water over my head and arms and rinsed off my upper body before filling up my camel bak.I surprised myself by reaching Pete’s Spring campsite with some gas still in the tank. There’s just one other tent up the hill from me but no hikers in sight anywhere. I’ve been struggling the last few days to remember why I’m hiking the AT. At some point before I fell asleep I looked out at the night sky through the forest and realized that’s it.. that’s why I’m here. To savor and try to remember the image, the feeling and emotions that are there for just a moment in time.","Mt Greylock

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541517,"During the night I noticed a light moving through the forest. After watching it for a bit I could tell that it was a hiker coming up the trail using a headlamp. I looked at my watch. 3:15 am. Weird… Must be someone who’s trying to stay cooler by night hiking, I thought. In the morning I noticed a few more hikers who had camped and asked if anyone knew about the night hiker.“Yea, it was me” said Bigfoot, a NOBO that I had met during my stay the night before on Mt Greylock. “I was in a bar and a lady offered to let me stay in a spare room at her house.” he explained. “Everything was going fine until she started swearing loudly at herself a bunch, then she overflowed the bathtub. The neighbor in the unit below called the police and then the landlord showed up. I had enough and decided to head to the woods for rest of the night.”The trail was friendlier today and my foot let me know about it by feeling better than it has the last two days. I stopped to rest mid day, noticed that I had coverage so I talked with both my wife and my dad. I explained how I’ve been feeling somewhat worn down lately and received good encouragement from both of them. I met a NOBO named Uncle Bob whose boot were so worn out that I had to take a photo of them. He tells me that he's going to get a new pair at the next town. He's from Germany, hikes with a pack that looks every bit of 60 to 65 pounds and told me that he has a minus 28 degree sleeping bag and a 4 seasons storm proof tent. I'm not sure why he needs this type of gear during the summer on the AT but I've learned that every hiker is ""hiking their own hike"". I felt stronger and more energetic going up the hills this afternoon for the first time since getting back from my trip to my daughter’s wedding. While crossing a powerline I noticed a nice breeze and decided to try and dry out my shirt. I stuck my hiking poles in the ground, took my shirt off and wrung a fair amount of sweat out onto the ground. Then I hung my shirt on the poles so the breeze would blow through my shirt and hopefully dry it out. I removed my knee brace so that my tights could also dry out in the breeze. After 30 minutes I put everything back on and headed North. My clothes weren’t completely dried out but I felt much cooler and more comfortable than I did when I arrived soaking wet and hot. I’ve been reading Slipknot and Rabbit’s journals since they are ahead of me and I can get an idea of what to expect on the trail. Rabbit mentioned a perfect stealth campsite on top of Consultation Mt, just about the right distance for my hike today. Just as I arrived it started to sprinkle so I quickly put up my tent and brought all my gear inside. While waiting to see what the rain was going to do I blew up my air mattress and laid down for a moment with my boots still on. It was only 5 pm and I still had to cook dinner and to hang my bear bag. I fell asleep almost immediately and rested for about an hour before realizing that I had dozed off. The rain had stopped so I got out and made my old standby, lentils and mashed potatoes. I discovered that I’m still quite tired of eating lentils. I’m going to try bringing food for dinner that doesn’t need to be cooked so that I can leave my cook stove, fuel, and cook pot behind. I’ve heard other hikers say that as they got closer to Maine they carried less and less gear. At this point anything that’s not absolutely critical is just extra weight. I put up my bear bag and turned in for the night even though it’s still light out. The thunderstorms and rain are coming down outside and I’m warm and dry. This turned out to be a great campsite although I never did find the spring that both Rabbit and Awol’s book mentioned.","Pete's Spring

I noticed that it was actually just the remnants of the storm coming down from the trees when the wind was blowing. The cold front that past in the night caused the morning to feel much cooler than the usual hot days I’ve been experiencing lately.I managed to do my stretching routine, get my bear bag down, pack up, and start hiking by 6 am. It had stopped raining but the vegetation along the sides of the trail was still wet. I struggled to see the path in front of me, blinking my eyes to try and get them to focus. I felt like I wasn’t awake yet. I didn’t have any coffee or “wakeup” time to get my mind going. On top of this due to the thick cloud cover it was fairly dark out. The trail and forest had a sinister wet, mossy, remote feel to it. My hike this morning was not fun. The trail wasn’t too bad, I mean it had plenty of rocks and roots to step over, but the lack of sun combined with the aches and pains in my body had me feeling less than enthusiastic. I’ve been hiking since February 5th - Just over six months, although I have taken a few breaks here and there.I’m tired. Physically and mentally. My legs, toes, and both feet hurt. I don’t have much interest in getting to know other hikers other than to get information about where I can find the next water source. If I wasn’t pushing a timeline to get to Katahdin before its closed on October 15th I would most likely take a week or so off to rest up and recharge. I need to find a way to increase my “get up and go” without taking too many days off from hiking. So here’s my “Green Hat” list. I used to teach my clients that the green hat allows you to come up with many potential solutions - no matter how crazy or practical they may sound. The purpose is just to get as many ideas down as possible in the hopes that you might discover something valuable in the list.

I’m at a laundromat, I went to the YMCA to pool walk and take a nice long hot shower. I”m going to go to an Indian restaurant tonight and go shopping for dinners I can pack on the trail that don’t need to be cooked so I can try out hiking without my stove. UPDATE 2:My foot is feeing SO much better. It may seem crazy that walking in a pool can help but it’s awesome therapy for me. I’m going to try and do more pool walks when I can fit them in. The nice Indian place was packed and I settled for choice number 2, a Colombian place which is where I am now. The music has too load bass for me but I’m doing my best to ignore it so that I have a chance of getting a decent meal, time to go shopping, and also get to bed before hiker midnight at 9 pm.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542085,"This morning I met Vic, my latest shuttle guy, at the trailhead near Manchster Center, VT. I left my car there and he drove me South to begin hiking again from Rt 9 near Bennington where I left off yesterday. It was forcast to rain today and I considered taking the day off but wanted to keep movin Northward, besides, it's warm enough right now that the rain isn't much of a problem. I'm going to try hiking without my raincoat. The reasoning behind this is that with a raincoat you'll end up wet anyway from sweating.While driving with Vic I discovered that he stays in shape by trail running. I'd estimate that he's in his 60's and he's still in good shape. He told me that he's training for something called the Escarpment Race. I recommended that he watch ""The Barkley Marathons"" on Netflix. It's about a gruesomely hard trail running race that almost no one finishes. The great news today is that my leg is feeling SO MUCH better. Walking in the pool yesterday seems to have really helped. I'm also going to keep my milage down to about 10 miles a day or less for awhile to see if this can help to keep my foot and leg from bothering me too much. I had a reader send me a comment by using my guest book on the left hand side and he was kind enough to provide some much needed encouragement to keep me going. You may have noticed that I've been feeling a little worn out lately. It was in responding to this comment that I realized what I've been doing wrong lately. I'm now close enough to Mt Katahdin that I've been thinking ""I'm almost there, just 500 some more miles to go"" rather than my usual focus of just getting to the next town. This is a fine way to think in the morning, after a day of rest, while I'm still fresh and strong prior to hiking up and over a few mountains in the heat of the summer. It's later in the day when I'm worn out that I start to think, ""What... 500 more miles... what the heck am I doing... my legs hurt, and so on."" So the secret is to NOT think about Mt Katahdin. Yea, it's only 500 some miles, but that's enough to overload my little brains mental circuits when it's taxed out trying to propel me up a hill late in the day. Right now, today, my focus is on getting to Manchester Center which is 40 miles from here. Once I get there I'll pick a new target. Rutland, VT. It's just another 50 miles - I know I can do that. This may seem simple, and it is. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. The bigger insight is in how much the mental aspect of things has been affecting my journey. So I had just walked up to bridge you see in today's photo when it started to sprinkle a bit. The bridge sagged on one side and I thought about maybe trying to sneak across it before my better judgement kicked in. I headed upstream and found a wider spot where I could make it most of the way across the stream without having to hop on rocks. I was figuring out how to stretch across the last 3 or 4 feet where the water was faster and deeper when the sky opened up and the rain came dumping down. I was getting wet from the top and the bottom at the same time. I found a root that was sticking out that I could jump onto and safely made it over to the other side of the brook. This was the first stream that I needed to ford on the AT. It rained for about 3 hours however by the time I made it to the shelter I was mostly dried out. There's about 15 other people here and the shelter is full. I sat down to eat dinner and talk with the other hikers before finding a place up on the hill to put up my tent. I changed into the dry clothes in my pack and am safe, dry and warm inside my tent.","Rt 9 Bennington, VT

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542093,"My leg continued to feel better today... Yay!I listen to a variety of audio while hiking. I get the New York Times audio digest on weekdays, listen to a number of podcasts, a few audiobooks, and occasionally listen to music using the Spotify app. One of my favorite podcasts is Tim Ferriss, the author of ""The Four Hour Work Week."" One of the interesting things that he says is that the title is a bit of a come on. He admits that most people, himself included, work more than four hours a week. Despite this deception I think he's interesting and is able to find, interview, and draw out information from his many guests that make the show well worth listening to. He talked today about making daily goals easily attainable. His first example was for authors. ""Don't try to write 2,000 words a day, just write two crappy pages and if it's going well then you can keep going and create more."" He thought it was important to have a goal you can feel good about reaching everyday. For example he said if you want to start exercising then set a goal to do just five minutes on the treadmill, do that each day and then see what happens. Another thing he mentioned was ""How can I make this easy?"" He was talking about writing a book but I'm thinking.. ""How can I make completing the AT easy?"" These two ideas together have me committed at this point to hike 8 miles a day. If I'm feeling good, I can go a little further - perhaps 10, but not more than about 12 miles in a day. I know that I can do this. I'm pretty sure that my leg can handle this. The downside is that I miss my wife a bunch. If I don't hike as far then I'll be on the trail for some extra days. This seems to be the dicotamy that most hikers face. They want to get miles in so that they can finish sooner. My goal is to enjoy each day while finding a way to complete the AT while keeping my body and spirit whole. And I want to see and hold my wife as soon as I can.

I stopped in the parking lot to hang my shirt in the sun to dry off the morning's accumulated sweat. 30 minutes later I was heading up the hill when I noticed Hestia resting by the side of the trail. I first met her over 1300 miles South of here. I said hello and then hiked onward and upward. The climb up Mt Stratton wasn't too steep but it seemed to go on for quite a while in the afternoon heat. I was happy to finally make it to the top where I found another fire tower! I took a deep breath and climbed up as I tried to control my fear of heights. I was happy to see that the windows had glass in them which made hanging out in the top of the tower easier for me than the scarier open windows in yesterday's fire tower. The views at the top were spectacular. I took a few photos through the windows and then climbed down one flight to get some more shots without the reflection from the windows. I was concerned about being up so high and worried that the wind might cause me to drop my iPhone. The trail on the way down was an improvement over the ascent and before long I was at the Stratton Pond Shelter. I have no idea why but someone had left a food bag hanging inside the shelter and some squirrels had managed to tear it apart and eat some of the food. The remaining food was divided up among the evening's hikers, myself included. I had some peanut butter along with part of an (unopened) bag of banana granola that was delicious. The remaining squirrel damaged food and trash was split up by various hikers who volunteered to hike the remains out. This was a ""no tenting"" shelter so I set up my pad and sleeping pad on one of the wooden bunks. Hestia set up her tent inside the shelter on a double bunk while announcing what she was doing, most likely to give any other hikers a chance to object if they wanted to since tents in the shelter is actually against the rules. The reason for doing this is simple. It keeps the mosquitoes away. I was tired and started to doze off at about 7:30 pm. I heard some of the hikers talking about hiking 3/10 of a mile down to the pond to see the sunset. I thought, ""I would like to see the sunset but I'm not hiking extra miles, besides, that's over an hour from now and I'll probably be asleep by then.""An hour or so later I was still awake and heard Hestia getting into her tent. ""What's that Hestia?"" I said, creating an imaginary conversation. ""How's the mosquitoes? Just fine thank you.""Well, the bugs have been biting a bit.

I should have rigged my tent somehow or at least brought along my head net which is safely stored in my car right now. On top of this I wish I had hiked down to the pond to see the sunset. I didn't want to hike any extra miles. When I first started hiking the AT I would always go out of my way to see a sunrise or a sunset. Now it seems like I'm too concerned about getting to Katahdin and I should lighten up and enjoy the journey. Coming down from the shelter spur trail I looked at the sign several times but was confused because the trail was blue blazed rather than white blazed. I hiked down it about 100 feet and then checked the Guthook app to verify that I was on the AT, which it appeared I was. After hiking another ten minutes without reaching the pond I checked again. Darn it! I'm on the trail that goes around the pond rather than on the AT. I doubled back and in the process covered more extra ground than I would have last night if I had gotten up to go see the sunset with the other hikers. Oh well...The pond is beautiful as you can see. I stopped at Prospect Rock and met Mudup and Tim, who are hiking the Long Trail. They were nice enough to hike with me for the rest of the day. The miles slid by as the three of us talked while walking along. I met Fugitive and Spider at the trail head and offered to give them a ride into town. We went to the outfitters where I discovered that Fugitive was going to buy a set of Leki hiking poles just like my old pair in the car. I offered to sell him my used pair instead for $40 and we were both happy.

I told Jeff that I loved his Hostel, I appreciated the fact that it was superclean, and enjoyed his extra friendly demeanor. I hiked about two thirds of the way up Bromley Mountain and stopped to sit on a nicely shaped rock in the shade. There were no bugs and there was a nice breeze so I spent almost 2 hours making some phone calls and searching on the web to find out more information about hiking the Appalachian Trail through the White Mountains in New Hampshire.I'm trying to figure out what days I'm going to be where, which huts to stay at, where I can camp in my tent, or stay at a nearby hostel. I'm trying to figure all this out while guessing how far I'll be able to go each day. I normally go 10 or 12 miles at the most but people have told me that in the white mountains most hikers don't hike as far as they normally do. After futzing around with this matter for too long I climbed the rest the way up Bromley Mountain and checked out the ski warming hut that hikers use as a shelter. Then I hiked the rest the way to Peru Peak shelter where I had planned on spending the night tonight. The only person there was a weird guy who had passed me a couple of times during the day that I didn't really want to hang out with. I looked at the guidebook and saw that there were tent sites a half a mile further down by the lake. So I told weird guy that I was going to go check out the lake and I hiked off. When I got close to the lake I could hear a noisy group of kids who are camping. I don't mind that they are camping - I actually think it's great that they're out in the wild. But I don't want to spend the night being woken up by kids hooting and hollering. So I continued Northward to look for another tenting spot. I ended up finding a decent stealth camping spot on the top of Baker Peak where I put up my tent just as it was starting to sprinkle. I'm in my tent now listening to the evening birds sing thinking about how lucky I am to be married to my wife who's nice enough to let me go out on this long journey.

I also figured out that the reason my toes were hurting so much on my right foot (my good side) was because I had developed the habit of scrunching them down with each step. If you can imagine trying to hold on to the trail by pushing your toes down into the ground with each step... that's what I was doing.So once I mentally thought ""Stop it!"" my toes and foot began feeling better right away. This worked so good that I'm also now trying to relax my injured foot as well. It seems to be helping. It's interesting to me how a problem like this can be created and then fixed with various mental gymnastics. I stopped for a snack at the first shelter today and along comes weird hiker guy from yesterday. I'm not sure what it is about him that bothers me. It doesn't help when he sits right next to me and lights up a cigarette. I headed back out with a determination to stay well ahead of him. So this afternoon when I came by Lost Pond I was surprised to hear weird hiker guy talking with a few other people in the nearby shelter. I could also smell the cigarette that he was enjoying. I say quietly by the pond soaking up the majesty of the scene for about ten minutes then I quietly slunk up the trail without weird guy seeing me. I thought about it as I walked along and I do appreciate anyone who has the get up and go to be out here hiking. I shouldn't be so quick to judge someone that I know little about. Late this afternoon I came up a hill and was engulfed with an exquisite pine tree aroma. I enjoyed this for the next mile or so including my time while walking through two rock gardens. These are areas where hikers have piled up rocks into stacks, often called cairns. The effect of seeing 40 or 50 of these all in one area is interesting. I wasn't sure how to respond so I added one more cairn to each of the rock gardens that I passed through. The shelter at the end of the day was 3/10 of a mile off the trail. I hesitated before walking up the side trail. With both out and back distances this adds another 6/10 of a mile - actually bonus miles. This means any mileage that's not part of the AT itself. I could continue walking and most likely find a small place to camp along the trail. I ended up going to the shelter. Now that I'm hiking alone again it's important to have a conversation or connection with other people to help keep me sane. Turns out that I met a dad who was out for the week with his 12 year old son. My father took me into the Canadian boundary waters on a canoe trip when I was ten.

I can't compare daytime rain to the sound of rain hitting the tent at night. I later heard from some other hikers that they experienced lightning but all I heard was some thunder and the pounding of the rain on my tent. I came to a road crossing where there was food... just 1/2 a mile down the road. I was eager to eat some real food so I hiked down the road while also trying to hitch a ride. Before long I arrived, still on foot. I changed my shirt and put my shirt out on the grass in the sun to dry. I remembered that my tent was wet from last nights rain and pulled it out spreading it out to dry as well. I had a nice meal, steak and mashed potatoes, a chocolate shake, and a several refills of diet coke. The waitress was nice enough to give me a ride back to the trail. When I arrived there I met a group of 4 hikers who were waiting on a taxi to take them into a hostel in town. I was surprised that I didn't want to join them. That's what I would have likely done a few months ago. I used to jump at any chance to take a break from the trail, even if it's just overnight. I think that I've finally gotten my pack weight down low enough, built up the strength in my legs, and finally turned the corner on the mental malaise that I'd been dealing with so that I'm actually enjoying my time on the trail again.

I was having fun making my way up Mt Killington over and around the many roots and rocks that were on the trail when it started to get dark out and the wind was picking up. I found a place to pitch my tent along the trail and climbed in to wait out the storm. It turns out that the storm went South of me. I heard a bit of thunder and saw a few rain drops here and there but nothing that was worth sitting out in my tent.No matter, I had cell coverage and made good use of the time to finish planning out my hike through the White Mountains in New Hampshire. I called and made reservations at three of the mountain huts run the the Appalachian Mountain Club. I made my best guess as to how far I'll be able to hike each day in order to determine where and when I might be staying. I've been asking the Southbounders that I see about the Whites and they have all told me that it's very windy but gorgeous. I'm looking forward to it. Once the non-storm was over I packed up my tent and hiked the rest of the way to the Cooper Mt shelter which is near the top of Mt Killington. I had planned on taking the 2/10 of a mile side trail up to the top so that I could eat some real food at the lodge. The guidebook said it was open until 5 pm so when I arrived at the side trail at 4 pm I headed up. Seriously up. The book said the trail was rather steep and it was quite correct. It was took both hands and feet to make it up the last stretch of trail. The wind was blowing hard enough at the top that I had a hard time walking. I made my way up over the summit and then down to the lodge, which had closed at 4 pm. Darn it! Turns out they had some nice snacks even though the kitchen was closed. I had a glass of Prosecco, a yogurt parfait, a small bag of BBQ potato chips, a brownie, a cookie, an ice cream sandwich made with 2 other cookies (500 calories), 2 peaches, and a gatoraid. Then I went into the bathroom and used the automated hand dryer to dry out my shirt along with my compression tights. It turns out that my water bladder in my pack has been leaking for the last few days. I thought it was strange that my back was sweating enough to wet down my butt and the back of my legs each day!I thought briefly about tenting up on top of Mt Killington but the strong wind convinced me that this would be a bad idea. I clambored back down the very steep trail and checked out the shelter. It was a dump with beer cans and water on the floor from a leaky roof. I hiked about a mile further along and found a nice stealth camping spot. Dr Fixit showed me how to pick a good spot by looking for contour lines on the map that are wider apart indicating a flatter area. He also taught me to look for a high enough elevation so that the bugs won't be as bad as at lower elevations. I'm camped out now about 100 feet East of the trail.

It felt nice to get back to my car where I promptly changed out of my stinky sweaty hiker clothes.I found a pool to go walking in for an hour as therapy for my injured leg. It's pretty boring compared to hiking the AT but I still enjoyed it and it does wonders for my foot and leg. Somehow it helps me to experience less pain for several days after going for a pool walk. I resupplied at the grocery store and sorted out my food on the top of my car which is parked in front of the Yellow Deli Hiker Hostel. I really like this place. The deli is uniquely furnished with curved tree branches or trunks that mold right into the restaurant seats. The people are friendly and they have awesome root beer on tap. Delicious!In the morning I'm going to shuttle my car North and then continue my adventure from the point I left the trail at 11 am this morning.,"Stealth Camping at mile 1695

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542959,"I enjoyed a delicious free breakfast today at the yellow deli Hikers Hostel before moving my car up to Hanover New Hampshire and shuttling back down to get on the trail today.I had originally called one shuttle service that was going to charge me $100 but then I called a number for Tom who was listed at the yellow deli hostile and he was willing to do it for basically gas money which was $20. I really appreciated this and it's great to have people like Tom helping out Hikers along the trail.Today was a beautiful day in the mid 60s with a light breeze blowing all day... And the humidity was very low. I walked past a beautiful pond and stopped by Gifford Woods state park where I enjoyed an ice cream and a soda. I walked past the turn off you can see in the photo where the long trail continues north up to the top of Vermont eventually reaching the Canadian border. The long trail was developed before the Appalachian Trail and uses the exact same white blazes for markings. I can see how it would be easy for someone hiking the AT to get confused and follow the long trail instead of the Appalachian Trail.I had planned on getting to the next shelter however with about an hour before dark I realized if I made it all the way to the shelter it would be right around nightfall when any other hikers would have already gone to bed. I've heard good things about a place called the lookout. It's not an official AT shelter but it's privately owned instead. It's up on top of a mountain and has a rooftop deck where you can hang out and look up at the stars. I'm planning on staying there tomorrow night and it's only about another 9 miles from where I was so I decided to camp along the trail rather than pushing ahead and reaching the shelter at nightfall.So that's where I am now in my tent, camping out alone in the woods. It feels quite isolated but that's where I ended up tonight. I feel good about getting eight miles in on a day when I also spent three hours moving the car up the trail.Thanks for reading my journal and joining me on my adventure.","Rt 4 Near Rutland/Killington VT

At 4 pm I reached The Lookout, a private cabin which the owners allow hikers to stay in. I dried my clothes in the sun,climbed up to the deck to take in the 360 degree view and then enjoyed a nap. I was so tired I fell asleep right on the wooden floor without taking a moment to blow up my air pad. It was about 7 pm when 4 or 5 other guys, all young and strong looking, arrived to join me for the night.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543524,"Today was pretty hot… I stopped three different times to dry out my pack and shirt in the sun. It seems like this is pointless because by the time I’m going up the next hill I’m soaked in sweat again. Despite this, drying out helps me to feel a little more comfortable and it’s also nice to stop for a 20 or 30 minute rest on a hot day like today. Getting water while hiking has been a little harder lately. Filling up by a shelter this morning I positioned my water holder to collect the dribbles coming down from some moss in the center of a mostly dried out stream bed. It took about 15 minutes for me to collect two liters of water. I crossed a road midday that was close enough for me to walk over to a farm store. I had an apple dumpling, a bag of cheetos, a cheese stick, a yogurt, and a gatorade. Eating this much means that I probably won’t go through all of the food I’ve brought with me. I must be getting tired of the protein bars I’ve been eating for the past six months since they seem to be the thing that I skip on days like today when I’m able to get some food along the way. On the way back to the trail from the farm store I met Miss Janet, the legendary trail angel. I’ve heard about her from so many different hikers over the past year. She travels up the trail each year in her van providing trail magic to hikers as they make their way North.I was tired and hungry later in the day and wanted a nice place to sit down, take a break and eat my dinner. I decided to stop at a dirt road crossing so that I could dry out my shirt in the sun while I ate. It felt strange to be sitting down on a dusty dirt road eating my dinner but that’s what I was doing today. Stumble Dwarf, a SOBO, came by and told me to look for some trail magic that was 3 or 4 miles up the trail. He also told me that he had recently fallen in a creek and gotten scraped up a bit. He was a shorter guy.. so he did look like a dwarf, and he had stumbled in a creek today. This was both funny and interesting at the same time.I was going to hike up to the top of the next hill before looking for a place to camp but about halfway up the hill I found a perfect campsite. It was flat and covered with pine needles. I set up my tent with both sides open to help me cool off in the breeze that is coming up the hill.","The Lookout

Linda came over as I was watching people jump off the bridge and invited me over to have a cold soda to drink. It turns out that Linda and her husband Randy are trail angels that help over 1,000 hikers a year. While I was enjoying a cold rootbeer Linda brought me out two meatball subs, Yum!As I was contemplating how much further I was going to hike a storm front came through with fierce winds and a bit of rain. After the storm came through I went over to check out some other trail magic set up by Long Shank, a thru hiker from 2010 who was there to greet a friend of his. I had some cookies, a hamburger, hotdog, and a few more things to drink. Before long there were 7 or 8 other hikers sitting around eating and chatting. I talked with a few people but found it easier to just sit and listen in to the ongoing conversations. I don’t know if this is because I’m tired from hiking or due to the fact that I’m a fair amount older than most of the other hikers. I’m going to make an effort to be more engaged in future conversations rather than allowing the introverted side of me to show itself. Tonight I’m staying in the top level of Linda and Randy’s barn, or maybe it’s a garage, I’m not sure. I did pick a bed that was close to a window just in case I need to get out if there’s a fire. I noticed that there’s not any smoke detectors here… Obviously I’m not going to complain (it’s a free place to stay after all) but it would make sense to have smoke detectors.

I was glad that I was on Linda and Randy’s porch when the storm came through. Mid morning I saw a note on the ground that was held down by a rock. “Ground bees in ravine ahead, watch out” it said. I moved along as fast as I could through the ravine (which isn’t very fast) and luckily didn’t see any bees. I came out into West Hartford, Vermont and followed the AT down Elm St to another trail angel’s house. I opened up the cooler and had some delicious banana bread. It turns out that a group of trail angels in West Hartford and nearby Hanover, NH open up their homes to provide housing for thru hikers. There's e’s a whole list of them that you can call. I was excited to cross the Connecticut River and arrive in New Hampshire! That’s 12 states down and only 2 more to go, although the SOBOs tell me that both of them are going to be pretty hard. I found the local gelato store and stopped in at the outfitters where I had shipped myself another merino wool shirt to replace the one I’ve been using which is now full of holes. Next I went to a pool so that I could walk in the water for an hour which you may know I do to help my foot and leg feel better. Everyone of the housing trail angels that called me back said they were already full for the night so I drove North to Glencliff which is the next place I was planning on leaving my car anyway.

It didn't seem quite as hot today as it has been earlier this week. I also stopped a couple of times to rest and get something to eat.

This was fun to do and it's pretty amazing that I'm able to do this while I'm on the trail.Towards the end of the day I came to a stream where some southbounders had warned me I should fill up with water since there was no other water for the next 8 miles.

There were 4 or 5 other hikers there who were quietly getting their gear together. The first climb today was about 1,000 feet. I took my time including a break at 10 am where I dried out my tent and of course my shirt. At 2 o'clock I stopped by Bill Akerly's house, the ice cream man. He has recently passed away but his son was there continuing the tradition for another year. I met two SOBOs that I had seen up in Glencliff and bid them goodbye as they headed off in the direction I had just come from. By the time I started up Smarts Mountain it was past 3 pm. I figured this was a good thing since the worst heat of the day was past. I set short term targets as I made my way up the 2,100 foot climb. ""Ok, I'm going to hike to the overlook that's 9/10 of a mile ahead."" I told myself. ""That's all I'm going to think about right now."" I listened to another Tim Ferriss podcast and he described breaking life down into two week experiments. ""You can do anything for two weeks."" He advised. I thought this was good advice for hiking. I stopped to rest again and had dinner. This is an advantage of hiking without my stove. It's much easier to eat along the trail. I sleep better if I'm able to eat at 5 or 6 rather than at 8 pm. I got a text of my granddaughter counting up to five. She's pretty cute so I face timed with my daughter while sitting there with an outrageous view of New Hampshire. The mountain became steeper towards the top. Interesting terrain, steeply sloped ledge rock with tree roots growing over it in places. I felt pretty good, most likely because it was cooler and I had taken it easy most of the day. I arrived at the tenting site but no one else was there. I put on my headlamp and hiked a little further up to check out the Rangers cabin. One set of hiking poles was outside so I figured I'd join whoever was in the cabin. When I quietly opened the door I saw 8 or 10 hikers who were all asleep for the night. I closed the door and decided to find someplace to tent instead. I went over to the fire tower and shined my headlamp up at it. ""Maybe I could sleep up there."" I thought for a moment before taking the more cautious approach of going back down to the tenting area. Another couple actually came in at 10 pm to join me here.

I noticed that some of the granite or marble type rocks along the trail were wet while other rocks were dry. I didn't know if this was because of water that was condensing on these rocks that were colder for some reason or what. Another hiker suggested that there might be silicone in these rocks that was absorbing moisture from the air. Interesting mystery. I found this campsite late in the day after making my way over Cube mountain. The trail had leveled out and I'd planned on staying down closer to the road, however this site looked good and I could hear a noisy crowd at what sounded like a kids soccer game about 1/2 further down by the road.Right behind my campsite there was a decent sized old foundation made of field stones.

The stream coursing down right nest to the trail was awesome! It was steep but luckily dry enough that i didn't have any problems making it up. There were places where wooden steps had been built into the rock faces to make the climb easier.Once I made it above treeline I was rewarded with outstanding views. I also met the moose you can see in today's photo. It isn't super healthy looking and has been standing right in the trail without moving much over the past week or so. I was surprised that the descent was also quite steep up towards the top of the mountain. The trail finally leveled out a bit and I was able to make better time as I descended. The final obstacle before getting to the road was to ford the stream. I managed to do this without getting wet since the weather here has been fairly dry.

I initially thought that they had hit the dog and I went over to see if I might be able to help out.Luckily, the dog wasn't hit. He was taking a nap in the middle of the road and the motorcyclist had stopped to try and find the owner or at least get the dog safety out of the roadway. I mentioned that I was on my way to the hostel nearby and despite my protests I found myself leading this dog along on a rope that the motorcyclist provided.

For some reason Lincoln didn't have a pizza place that delivers so I was stuck with whatever food I could find at Chet's house/hostel.It turns out that there wasn't much to choose from. No stove or microwave, just an old refrigerator that was full of rather old looking hiker leftovers. The bunks were full so I put my tent up in the back yard and went down in the basement to finally get my laundry done.While baby sitting my laundry I made a peanut butter tortilla from the hiking food I was carrying in my pack. There were some cans of ""free hiker food"", yams, green beans and such but nothing that looked good enough to eat. I opened a box of generic cheerios and ate a handful while pondering what to do for dinner.

I could also hear traffic noise, the dryer vent, and the next door neighbors who ended up talking loudly until about 11:30 pm.

The 2 weeks I've just taken off have been awesome. I was able to rest up both physically and mentally. After being away for so long I really enjoyed the time with my wife. Hiking the trail and my daily contemplation has helped me to begin to fully appreciate all of the goodness I've been blessed with. My wife and kids are at the center of an incredible life. The pain, numbness, and tingling sensations from my leg and foot took a few days to calm down after the exertion from the Whites that I put my body through the week before my vacation. Since I was no longer hiking 10 miles a day I expected everything to stop hurting but was surprised to experience a fair amount of pain in my hip muscles. So I asked myself the question ""If I'm barely walking, going a few blocks to the beach and back, why the heck is my body hurting so much? The answer came to me late one night a few days ago as I was walking back and forth in the kitchen of my parents summer home in Maine. I'd stopped off to visit them on my way back to the trail. I was explaining to my father how I'd figured out my next big goal to go after once I finish my hike by reaching Mt Katahdin. ""I'm going to work at getting rid of this limp I've developed."" I said. Dad mentioned a book he'd read called ""Pain Free."" It turns out that I have a copy of this book at home that I'd bought a few years ago. I told Dad I was searching for a quick fix to my injuries back then and how I'd skimmed through the book before tossing it aside. ""This is just a bunch of stupid exercises"" I remembered thinking. I went on to explain how I wanted, expected, and insisted on finding some sort of miracle cure such as an injection, a nerve block, a pill I could take - something, anything that would ""fix"" the damage from my shattered hip and associated nerve damage in my leg. So now, after my admission three years after my injury, that I would have to work at healing for the rest of my life, and another 1500 miles or so of hiking on the AT, I discovered that if I could find a way back to a more normal body posture and gait that this will allow my body to continue healing.

I walked up and asked him if he might be able to give me a ride to the trail hoping that perhaps he might do it without charging me. I ended up paying the $19 fee which to me was worth it to not have to embarrass myself by standing out there hoping that someone would stop and pick up a 56-year-old man with a backpack on.I expected some mental resistance getting back on the trail today. I tried my best to walk along without limping which is what I've been practicing lately. This was easier on the flat portion the trail but once the uphill rocks started I quickly forgot about this.So I went through a series of mental gyrations as my leg and foot began bothering me. I wondered what the heck I was doing out here attempting to climb the White Mountains when I could be at home doing my deliberate walking back-and-forth in the living room. ""Maybe I should just stay home and try and heal myself there"" I suggested to myself.I ended up, of course, heading up the mountain continuing my quest to hike the entire Appalachian Trail. At one point it got steep enough that I took my poles off and put them on my pack before clamboring up a steep rocky section. I saw another steep section shortly thereafter so I kept my poles on my pack for the next 45 minutes as I made my way up the mountain using my feet and hands - at times pulling myself up and at other times walking along like a monkey on all fours.I finally made the 6.4 miles to Mizpah Hut and after almost eight hours of hiking. I think today I was going slow because of the steepness and because it's my first day back on the trail. I'm glad I didn't have too far to go. I enjoyed a nice dinner and got to talk to a group of four girls who were out in the bad weather up on the mountaintop yesterday. They hiked from Madison spring hut up over Mount Washington and down to Lake of the clouds hut in 40 to 50 mile an hour winds and rain with gusts as high as 98 mph. Part of me was impressed by the fact that they were willing to take on this challenge and another part of me was amazed that they went out in such bad weather. They made it OK but if one of them had gotten injured or for some reason had gotten off the trail they could've been in serious trouble as a day like that can cause a hiker to get hyperthermic very quickly.It's great to be here at the hut. I have enjoyed a delicious dinner and I'm settling down into my bunk for the night.Tomorrow I hike up over Mt Pierce for a short day of less than 5 miles to Lake of the clouds hut. This will put me partway into the area that's above tree line and leave me with about 10 miles to go the following day to get beyond tree line where I can camp for the night.It's awesome to be up here in the White Mountains and the views are incredible.

I was still having thoughts about the beach and ""what if I just stopped now"" contemplations but much less of this was going on as compared to yesterday. It's been interesting staying in the huts with people who are out for a few days doing hut to hut trips. Most folks are friendly enough but the camaraderie that's shared by thru hikers is missing. For example tonight there were two of us waiting in line to check in when a group of three men I'll call the geezers barged in the door and totally butted to the front of the line. I finally checked in and was told that they had reserved a bottom bunk for me so that I'd have an easier time getting in and out with my damaged leg. I went to see where I was going to sleep and the geezers were encroaching on my bunk space. ""Reserved for Peter? That signs probably from 2009."" Is the conversation I heard as I came in the door. ""Actually that's me, and yes that's my bunk."" I declared, glad that I had arrived in time to defend my spot. My plan for tomorrow is to wake up early and see the sun rise as I climb Mt Washington. I don't have a reservation at the next hut so I'm going to ask about work for stay. The staff, called the croo, allows a few thru hikers to help out with chores in exchange for food and a spot to sleep on the dining room floor. If I can't get work for stay then I'll need to hike about three miles further to reach the next campsite. There is another place to camp that's 6/10 of a mile downhill on a side trail but I don't like doing bonus miles, especially if it's downhill and back up. I'm going to get my water and have my pack ready tonight so that I can make an early exit in the morning.","Mizpah Hut

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546897,"I went to settle down for bed in the bunk room last night right after dinner. My initial plan was to wake up at 5 am so that I could get an early start on a big day and perhaps see a bit of the sunrise from the top of Mt Washington. I went to set the alarm on my phone but realized that in the small bunk room I'd likely wake up the other hikers so I decided to try and wake up without the alarm. The AT etiquette for campsites, shelters, and hostels is to be quiet when other hikers are laying down or sleeping and to be cautious when using your headlamp to not shine your light directly at another hiker. Most decent headlamps have a red light feature that allows you to see ok in the dark with a much less obtrusive amount of light. Unfortunately most of the hikers who stay at the huts in the White Mountains have never seen or heard of this AT etiquette. You'd think that anyone with a tiny bit of common sense could figure out that waving a spotlight around at night in a small dark room might disturb the other occupants, however my bunkmates last night including the geezers were absolutely clueless. I had already settled in, read a few pages of a book on my iPhone, and closed my eyes when 4 or 5 of these brain dead morons came in with headlamps blazing moving around and making more noise than a cabin full of rowdy 10 year olds at summer camp. On top of this the person directly across the aisle from me pulls out a flashlight that was big enough to be used as a billy club, and flips it on full blast before laying it down on the bed pointing in my direction. I contemplated whether or not I should say something but elected to use the best chunk of optimism that I could mentally mix up by thinking ""Surely they are going to turn off their searchlights very soon.""The next thing I remember (not counting the snoring episode that lasted several hours) was when the person above me climbs down without using the ladder and steps on my leg which of course woke me up. I pushed the button on my watch to see that it was 11:30 pm. Next, (and I'm definitely NOT making this up) this person turns his headlamp he's holding on and moves within 8 inches of my face with the light pointing directly at me!I really should have said something but I wasn't sure if this crazy moment was the result of complete stupidity or if perhaps this was a retaliatory move from the geezer who had tried to move in and take over my bottom bunk spot earlier in the day. ""Is he threatening me... oh, I can see now that he's looking for the bunny slippers that he put under my bunk in the spot where MY stuff was before he shoved my stuff over into the corner.""So, I hope you can see, that by this point I'd had it. In hindsight I would have been better off moving from the bunk room to go sleep on the floor of the dining room with the work for stay thru hikers. But instead I did something that I""m, uh, not so proud of, but I did it and you're here to read about my adventure so here goes... I decided, the heck with it, I AM going to set my alarm for 5 am. And then, (This is the part that's hard to write) I turned the volume ALL THE WAY UP. Ug.. What comes next wasn't my best self. When my alarm went off at 5 am I took my time, I mean REALLY took my time turning it off. Everyone else, all of the noisy light shiners and especially the jerk that shined his light right in my face were nice and awake... And I'll admit that this gave me somewhat of a thrill. I moved quickly to get outside and heading up Mt Washington before one of my roommates decided to joust with me. The early morning light creeping over the summit above me painted pastel colors on the lakes, the mountains, and the sky. The top of Mt Washington was fun. There was a small museum, gift shop, a place to get a breakfast sandwich, and a crowd gathering for the Mt Washington Summit bicycle race. I noticed that some thru hikers had stealth camped underneath the cog railway platform for the night. I hung around to see the first wave of finishers in the race come across the line and went over to get a photo with the race winner, Eneas Freyre. I took some photos with the summit sign and made a video for my youtube channel to help share the excitement of making it to the top of Mt Washington.Heading North, down the mountain, I was rewarded with a view of the steam powered cog railway making it’s way up the mountain. My parents rode the cog railway up Mt Washington in 1944 on their honeymoon. I found out later that the steam powered train only makes one trip a day with all the other trains powered by diesel. I haven’t verified this but another hiker told me that the diesel trains use 18 gallons of gas while the steam powered version uses an entire ton of coal to make it up to the top. The day was clear with a medium breeze as I made my way above treeline down Mt Washington, skirted around Mt Clay, another trail around the top of Mt Jefferson, over Adams Five and Mt Sam Adams, and finally past Mt Quincy Adams to arrive at Madison Springs Hut. They agreed to let me do “work for stay” and right now I’m hanging out with Slope Turtle and Mr Tuxedo who are my work mates for the evening.","Lake of the Clouds Hut

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547076,"The trail this morning headed straight up Mount Madison immediately after leaving the Madison Springs hut. I managed to make my way up the various places that I call ""Rock puzzles"". ""How can I get up that?"" Is the question I have to answer each time. Closer to the top of the mountain the trail turns into a boulder field. It's as if a huge dump truck dumped just a ton of rocks ranging in size from baseballs all the way up to small tables. Instead of an obvious path, there are simply cairns - triangular piles of rocks - that mark the general direction of the trail. I find walking on this type of surface difficult because of two reasons. First off, it's hard to find a flat place to rest my injured foot. Each rock is different and the side pointing up might be flat, and edge, or even a point. The other thing is that due to the poor balance I have on my injured side and also perhaps due to my age, I feel like I'm constantly in danger of falling. This ongoing precarious feeling wears me out mentally. The summit is breezy with gusts of 40 to 50 mph. I take a few photos and then quickly head down the other side thinking of how nice it will feel to get below treeline and get out of the wind. The trail roller coasters down the ridge line going over a number of smaller summits, each one covered in similar boulder fields for me to traverse. When I finally make it down past treeline I'm out of the wind and the trail is much smoother. After a steep descent through the woods I stop to eat some lunch while processing thoughts of quitting my hike. ""This is nuts... That was not fun... What am I doing hiking such treacherous terrain?"" I think to myself as I sit there looking at a lone house sized rock. Honey Buns, Jokester, and a few other hikers show up to join me in resting after the trek over Madison. They are contemplating taking a shortcut trail that is not part of the AT down to Rt 16. ""It's about two miles shorter but I'm sure I'll end up walking at least two miles when I'm in town."" says Jokester. Honey Buns wants to stay on the AT and they go back and forth trying to decide which way to go. I suggest that if they do skip two miles then they'll need to walk an extra two miles, ""Sometime in the next year, so that it counts, while thinking about the AT, and you have to have a few pages of the guidebook in your pocket.""Jokester laughs and then adds ""Yea, and if anyone asks where you're going you have to say Katahdin."" I feel better after joking around with them and make my way down the (longer) trail which is part of the AT. I'm rewarded before long with a section called Old Jackson Road which is mostly smooth, wide, and gently sloped downhill. I make it to my car at Pickham Notch and drive to White Mountain Lodge in Gorham to spend the night. This hostel is clean and well run. I'm looking forward to the stuffed French toast for breakfast tomorrow.","Madison Spring Hut

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547354,"I was going to zero today but instead elected to hike up the very steep Wildcat Mountain with a fanny pack holding my cell phone, a small bottle of juice, and half of a rueben sandwich. I met Tom, a rather fit section hiker who was going to hike up the mountain and then meet his wife at the top of the gondola as she wanted to skip the steep climb. As I got to know Tom I discovered that he was in great shape from ""48 years of rowing"". Despite being in great shape, Tom was willing to slow down enough that I was able to keep up with him. It was great to make my way up without the weight of my pack, and because I was busy talking with Tom, I was able to reach the summit without having to think too much about just how steep the mountain was. At the top I took the gondola down, finishing my day after doing only three miles. It was a little scary but fun to ride the gondola down. The plan is to take the gondola back up tomorrow to continue my hike northward. At the bottom I met Trotter, a 64 year old NOBO who was at the end of her rope. She had also taken the gondola down however her reason for coming down was that she'd had it with all the steep climbs, rocks, and technical sections in this part of the trail. ""I'm going to skip the rough sections and go up to Andover... Can you drive me there, I'll pay for your gas?"" she asked. ""That's over two hours round trip and I have stuff I need to get done this afternoon"" I responded. ""I'll give you a ride anywhere you want here in town... Maybe I can take you to the bus station"" I suggested. ""You should skip up to Andover with me, this is a horrible part of the trail. Why don't you just skip this hard part? You can always come back and do it later.""""Uhhh.... No thanks, I really don't want to skip any parts of the trail."" I explained. I ended up dropping Trotter off at a campground where she said she knew some other people. She thanked me for the ride but the scowl on her face let me know that she wasn't too happy about my refusal to shuttle her up to Andover.

The views of Mt Washington were good on the ride up and from the top of the mountain. The next section of trail headed North from the gondola was quite straight up looking. Trotter had mentioned something about this yesterday - I think that's what may have made her decide to skip ahead to Maine. Having already done Wildcat peak E, I made my way over the other Wildcat peaks of D, C, and A. I'm not sure what happened to Wildcat peak B. Then I worked my way down the steep descent to Carter Hut. As I walked up to the hut I was greeted with a nice ""Hi Flash 52, how are you doing?"" by Smiley, a NOBO that I had met a few days ago at Madison Springs hut. Thankfully the dinner was nice and bunks were less eventful than my experience at the last hut with no crazy headlamps waking me up at night.

To liven things up a bit I decided to cowboy camp on top of Mt Moriah tonight. Cowboy camping is where you don't bother with a tent and just sleep out under the stars in your sleeping bag.

This is the last of 14 states on the Appalachian Trail and the SOBOs have been telling me that it is gorgeous. I stopped for a snack at the Full Goose Shelter at 2:30 and then headed down the mountain to tackle the famous Mahoosuc Notch. This is a narrow notch with cliffs on both sides that is filled with house sized and smaller boulders. You have to make your way around, over, and at times under this jumble of rocks that is one mile long. On the way down the hill I met Tip Toe, a 72 year old lady from Connecticut. She was making her way carefully but steadily down to the Notch. I decided to hike with her through the Notch to make sure that she didn't have any trouble making it through. It was nice to have two of us trying out different ways to get through the various sections of the Notch. ""This looks like a better way to go over here"" we'd say to each other. The problem was that Tip Toe's slow pace was pushing us dangerously up against the end of the day. I kept looking at my watch but decided not to worry about running out of daylight as I felt that I should stay with Tip Toe. We had another 3/10 of a mile to go when it got dark and we turned on our headlamps. Then the thunder started rumbling overhead. Before long there were a few drops of rain coming down. We needed to get out of the Notch and quick, but it's impossible to hurry when you're trying to find a safe way though an obstacle course like this. We finally made it through the Notch and began to look for the campsite that was on the North end of the Notch. The rain was beginning to come down now and I was ready to call it a night. I saw the glow of a tent off to the side of the trail but didn't see a sign or a trail that went over to the campsite. When we begin hiking uphill I knew that we had most likely gone past the campsite. I checked my ""Guthook"" app and confirmed my suspicions. We turned around and finally found the mostly overgrown trail to the campsite. It turns out that there wasn't a sign since this was an unofficial campsite even though it was big enough for a dozen or more tents. I put up my tent in the rain which was now pouring down in earnest. I settled in for the night but was awaked at about 3 am by a shivering Tip Toe who was outside my tent. ""Can I share your tent, I'm all wet, shivering and I'm freezing"" she said explaining that she hadn't set up her hammock correctly in the rain. ""Sure, come on in"" I said, moving my stuff out of the way to make room for her. I gave her my sleeping pad to insulate her from the ground and unzipped my sleeping bag so that it could be used as a blanket over both of us. She was able to warm up and went to sleep while I did my best to catch a few winks with just my head on the edge of the sleeping pad.

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547376,"Here's the photo from when I arrived in Maine yesterday. It feels great to finally be in Maine. I made my way up Mahoosuc Arm this morning. It's a 1,600 foot climb over about a mile and half that other hikers had said was a real challenge. There were a number of places where there's a big slab of rock that's tilted uphill at 45 degrees or worse where you need to figure out how to get up. It's too steep to walk up the face, you can try it but your shoes or boots will let go and you'll slip back downhill. So the method is to look either for some rough spots that will give your shoe soles some traction, or make your way up the edges trying to find some tree roots to step on while also holding onto the trees that are right next to the trail. Many of the trees have been used for this same purpose by other hikers and some of them are getting loose like a tooth that's been wiggled and is ready to be pulled out. I took my time, resting a few times on the way up, and before long made it to the top. I enjoyed the hike down past Speck Pond which was wind blown with whitecaps. I stopped off at the shelter to eat lunch before hiking up and over Speck Mountain. There were some steep sections and the wind was blowing pretty good up top - I'd guess that the gusts were about 70 mph. After that the trail became nicer and I made my way down to Grafton Notch where I was pleasantly surprised to see that my car was still there. I drove over to The Cabin which is a really nice hostel here in Andover.

I brought my cell phone, 1/4 roll of TP (just in case) a bottle of gatorade, water treatment pills (so I could get more water) a few protein bars and some peanut M&Ms. On the way up Mt Baldpate I met Cary, a section hiker from Madison, WI. He was ok going at my pace and I enjoyed having someone to talk with so that I wasn't thinking about all the steps I needed to take up the mountain. He's a journalist of sorts and was interested in my story of how I shattered my hip, dislocated my femur, and suffered nerve damage in my leg prior to deciding to hike the AT.Before long... Presto!

Cary is a former journalist who’s writing a book about characters he’s met on the AT. I did my best to supply him with a variety of Flash 52 stories in an effort to liven up his book a bit. Kirsten has kids that are about the same age as ours so we traded updates and stories about the interesting lives our children are living. We got the bigger climbs out of the way in the morning and were rewarded with a relatively easy downhill trail towards the end of the day. I am so much - SO MUCH - happier hiking on trails like this as compared to the rocky boulder fields that I had to traverse while in the White Mountains. I’m finding that even a tough obstacle or steep uphill section is now easier for me because I tell myself “At least this is better than the Whites.”Hopper, the right hand person who helps Honey and Bear at The Cabin, was there waiting for us at the end of the day’s hike. Cary asked her if she was Bismarck’s hiking partner and she said “Yes, but I don’t want to talk about it.” It turns out that Bismarck was the famous fugitive on the Appalachian Trail who was captured at Trail Days in 2015. He apparently had embezzled 8.5 million dollars from Pepsi, his employer before hiking and hiding out on the trail for six years!Hopper as his girlfriend and hiking partner fell in love with a Bismarck who was, according to several people that knew him, “One of the nicest people on the trail.” He is now serving a 96 month prison sentence after pleading guilty and promising to pay back 7.6 million dollars.

At this hostel, more than any other place I’ve stayed on the trail, I felt so welcomed and cared for that it was hard to leave. I was hiking with all of my gear again today although I was only carrying two days food so my pack wasn’t very heavy. I had originally planned to take a day and a half to hike the next 13 miles but since there weren’t any big hills and the trail was reasonably smooth I decided to try and see if I could make it to Rangely in one day. By the time I ate breakfast, packed up, and got a ride with Honey out to the trail it was 9:30 am - a late start if I’m going to make 13 miles. By the way, listening to Honey’s stories and her easy going manner combined with her laugh are a great way to start the day. It’s amazing that she’s still hiking from time to time at age 84!Last night I was dead tired and my leg was really bothering me. So I was pleasantly surprised this morning when I felt good - and that’s all of me including my leg and foot. I tried to walk purposefully without rushing. If I do this right then I can make better time than if I hurry too fast which wears me out so that I then end up slowing down. I made sure to limit any stops that I made. If I sat down for a snack I looked at my watch and tried to get going again within 5 to 10 minutes. I skipped the several views I went by and even walked right by the shelter that was “100 yards” off the trail. I knew that if I stopped at the shelter for lunch I’d probably meet another hiker and end up talking for an extra 20 minutes, time that I didn’t have today. I did say “Hi” to everyone I met but it was more like “Hi, beautiful day isn’t it?.. have a nice hike.” all while I kept moving.When I think back to how things were when I first started - stopping off at every viewpoint and signing the log books in every shelter I realize that I have one focus right now and that is to finish. I am still enjoying my adventure however I also can't wait to get back home. The trail was mostly decent today with some minor ups and downs compared to yesterday’s hike. I arrived at Route 4 by 6 pm so that I could be waiting for Stacy at the Farmhouse Inn who showed up on time right at 6:10.

The hostel was full so I’m in my tent out back tonight. I’m glad I decided to walk further back in the field because there’s a group from a wedding that rented out the bunkhouse that is talking loudly out on the back porch.

In today's photo I've shared one of the more challenging sections of the trail I passed over. I used to react to tough sections of the trail with a ""What the heck?"" attitude - surprise at the various challenges that the Appalachian Trail puts in the path of Thru Hikers. Now that I've seen so many challenges I just look for a way up and over whats in front of me and I focus on getting past without slipping or falling. The top of Saddleback was open, above tree line with mostly flat ledge type rock to walk on. The sky was clear and I had amazing views all around me. I sat down by the summit sign to eat my dinner of tortillas, pepperoni, and cheese. I noticed a family walking by with a young girl who looked to be about 8 years old. ""Hmm... kind of late to be up here, it's almost 6:30 - there's only about one more hour of daylight"" I thought to myself. I was still there 30 minutes later, enjoying the view and unable to decide if I wanted to hike further tonight or not, when two southbound gals came by looking for the trail down the ski slope. ""I think it's on that next peak to the south"" I suggested. ""Do you have a headlamp?"" I asked.""Oh, yes, we have headlamps. Our parents are waiting for us."" came the reply. I thought that perhaps their parents would be worried until they made it down the hill in the dark. After finding a spot where the wind was blocked from the West I decided to sleep out cowboy style on the mountain top. The stars are out, thousands of them, AND this time I have my glasses with me.I just saw a falling star and made a wish that I could soon be home in my wife Joanna's arms.","Route 4

There's probably a way to know the humidity or dew point to be able to predict when and where I can sleep under the stars without getting wet but I haven't figured it out yet. I packed up everything except my semi wet sleeping bag and then folded it in half before strapping it to the top of my pack so that it could dry out as I hiked this morning. The trail dropped down steeply into a saddle as I made my way over to the next peak which is called ""The Horn. There were a number of places that I had to be very careful not to fall and I also saw the metal ladder that a southbounder had mentioned yesterday. ""I saw my first ladder"" he had said.. ""Hmm.. "" I thought, ""That means I'm going to go up my LAST ladder on the trail - I hope!""I made my way up The Horn, and then Saddleback Junior, before coming to Poplar Ridge Shelter. This is the last place that anyone saw Gerry Largay in 2013, the 66 year old hiker who tragically got lost along the Appalachian Trail. She got off the trail to go to the bathroom and couldn't find her way back to the trail. I've read quite a few of the reports online about her and have noticed that many of them contain information that contradicts some of the other reports. The sad part is that she died even though she was a part of the AT hiking community who tend to look out for and care for each other. When initially lost she may have been too flustered to think clearly, however I wish she had simply stayed put rather than moving to higher ground. What if she had made some arrows out of rocks or sticks indicating her path of travel? Would it have made a difference? So I looked around at the rugged terrain and thought about ""Inchworm"" (that was her trail name) today as I walked down to Oberton Steam and up to the Spaulding Mountain Lean-to which is where I'm spending the night tonight with three other day hikers and a late starting Southbounder.","Mt Saddleback

I continued to skip all the views and looked at my watch to count the minutes each time I stopped for water or to eat my lunch so that I'd have a chance of making it by 6 o'clock. I managed to ""camel up"" or drink a decent amount of water prior to each of my climbs today so that I could get by with either very little or no water as I went uphill. I quizzed the SOBOs that I met asking them about water ahead on the trail so that I could know for sure if the stream in the guidebook was really there or if it had dried up. This enabled me to refill my water right when I needed it - after I'd made it up most of the next mountain. I felt good going uphill today, not super strong but pretty consistent. My leg muscles started to hurt at one point so I backed off the pace just a bit. I knew that I'd have to keep my speed up, or at least avoid slowing down to a crawl in order to make my miles today. It was about 12:30 pm and I was making the 2,000 foot climb up South Crocker (followed by North Crocker) and I was rewarded with a mostly decent trail. It was steep and rocky in places but most of it was just uphill rock and dirt combo. Despite the cooler temps, in the 60s, my shirt was soaked all the way through. I stopped once to wring out the sweat thinking of the few extra ounces that I was leaving behind. The trail towards the end of the day went from steep to not-so-steep to a slight downhill. This was a welcome sight and helped to keep me on time even though I was getting tired. I looked down and was surprised to see the ""2000 Miles"" sign that another hiker had created on the trail.

The idea was to avoid sweating on it and keep my shirt dry since I'd left my extra shirt behind in my never-ending effort to reduce the weight I'm carrying. Well, I ended up keeping my shirt dry but the slight rubbing from my pack caused me to have a number of rashy, raw spots, the worst one on my shoulder and several around my middle section where my pack belt sits. So I'm letting them heal today and will get something from the store to treat them - maybe something like diaper rash cream?""Just another part of the adventure"" I'm telling myself.

At dinnertime I wasn’t too hungry so I grabbed a can of baked beans from my car trunk and a rootbeer from the fridge to have along with a slice of pizza that Outback offered me. I know that may not sound like much of a meal but compared to the pepperoni and cheese on tortillas that I’ve been eating on the trail it was actually pretty good. In the morning the Sterling Inn shuttled me down to Stratton to continue my Northward hike. It was almost 10:30 am by the time I started up the trail, warming up with a few flat miles before heading up South Horn Mountain. My leg felt good after walking in the therapy pool yesterday and the trail was decent - not too steep or rocky, just steadily up. I’d been looking forward to getting this “last before Katahdin” day of 4,000 foot mountains out of the way for the past few weeks. Yet I found myself feeling like I was spending my last day with an old friend. “What… ? No more big mountains to climb?” I made my way up and over South Horn as I enjoyed the views and then found myself buffeted by wind and fog as I reached the summit of Bigelow West Peak. The summit pokes up into the sky like the back of a brontosaurus. Going over this in the wind and the fog had me a bit worried and thinking “What the heck am I doing up here?”I found that once I made it over the other side and back below treeline I was able to take a deep breath and relax a bit. Within another 20 minutes I found the campsite that I was hoping to reach today. The caretaker had posted a map of the campsite showing where the tent pads, the privy, and two different water sources were. I hiked around looking for the first water source but the trails I found didn’t seem to match the map I’d looked at. (I took a photo of the map so I could refer back to it) So I turned my headlamp on and went back to where I started and then down another trail to find the other water source. It was a dripping spring with a puddle below it that I was able to get a few liters of water from. I had to push the bugs and some pine needles out of the way before using the bottom of a soda bottle I use as a water scoop to get the water I needed. I decided to skip the wooden tent platforms and instead found a place on the ground to set up my tent. I haven’t used a platform yet and didn’t want to try and figure it out in the dark as it started to rain after a long day. It’s nice to be in my tent with the sound of the rain coming down.

It’s a combination of sadness combined with feelings of “what the heck am I doing out here”, and “I can’t do this”. Having been through this before I know that I’ll feel better in a few minutes but it’s weird. I’ve made it this far hiking the Appalachian Trail. I can certainly continue and most likely even successfully finish my hike.

I just want you to know exactly what it’s like to be on this journey even though it feels a little strange or embarrassing to tell you about something like this. I knocked out one last 4,000 foot peak first thing this morning and then enjoyed a decent trail that guided me gradually downhill through the afternoon. I had heard about “trail magic ahead” and was pleased to arrive at East Flagstaff Road where a handful of Maine Appalachian Trail Club members were doing their annual 4 day trail magic fest.I had two rootbeers, some potato chips, chocolate cake and a couple of hamburgers. Delicious!I enjoyed talking with the hiking club members and the other hikers who came by. I even got to meet “Guthook” the guy who created the GPS app that I use everyday to show me where I am on the trail. I was tempted to tent nearby so that I could sample their breakfast offerings but instead decided to get a few more miles in toward Katahdin. About a mile before reaching my target - a campsite on a hill above the lake - I stepped out on the sandy beach of Flagstaff Lake. It was gorgeous AND there was a perfect flat spot with no rocks on it where I could set up my tent. So I’m now listening to the sound of the waves lapping against the shore and also just heard some loons making their haunting calls for me to enjoy. This is so cool and so beautiful.

Besides, they offer a 12 pancake breakfast. The trail takes you right over the Pierce Pond dam which appeared to be made out of spare lumber. Really - it was a combination of various boards, logs, and rocks, all held together by old wagon spikes. It’s been there for a long time so it must be built well enough to hold back the pond.

The sun brightens up the forest along with my mood. Also temperature is cooler today, it feels like it's in the low 60s... nice to not be sweating all day. I was passed by a number of other hikers including Will who is in his 60s. I say I'm not competitive but then I notice that I'm trying to stay in front of other hikers I see. In most cases everyone that I see ends up going by me at some point. I made my way up Pleasant Pond Mountain and finally made it to the top. I looked toward the Northeast to see if I could spot Kadahdin but I wasn't sure if it was one of the many mountains that I could see. The trail descended which made it easier to work my way downhill. I've been experimenting hiking without the knee brace on my right side. (this is my good side) I've worn it since my knee started hyper extending, or bending backwards, in Southern Virginia. While I can bend my knee and climb easier without the brace on, at this point I should probably just keep wearing it. I'm carrying it in my pack in case my knee acts up so I may as well have it on my leg. The Guthook app has comments from other hikers about where to find stealth camping sites. These are usually just a flat clear spot along the trail where other hikers have spend the night. My goal was to reach a stealth spot that was just past a power line. However I was feeling tired and it was getting close to 7 pm which is when it's starting to get dark now. I spied a flat clear spot that was about 75 off the trail and decided to stop for the night. Since I got rid of my stove I've been eating my dinner of tortillas, cheese, and pepperoni along the trail. I usually find a rock to sit on at 5 or 6 o'clock. This is much faster than cooking dinner and it simplifies camping for the night. I arrive, put up my tent, hang my food bag, and then go to sleep.

I get wet either from the rain, or, if I do wear my raincoat, I get wet from sweating under it - so as long as I have a dry set of clothes and my sleeping bag (inside its dry bag) the rain won't bother me. Unless the temperature drops down into the 40s or 50s and it rains - then I'd have to hole up in my tent to stay warm.

Noticing something that might be a bear seems to happen almost everyday and in almost all cases it turns out to be a tree that's fallen over or whatever. So when this black thing moved I stopped to get a better view and find out what it was. Turns out it was a female moose. I took a few photos and used the zoom feature to get the close up view you can see in today's photo. Next I decided to make a video for my YouTube channel which shows off the moose quite nicely. You can see the moose video here. If you watch the moose video first before reading any further you'll get a better sense of exactly what happened. Go ahead and watch the moose video now.After the video stops the moose turned back toward the trail and took a few steps toward me. I hiked back South on the trail for a ways to create some distance since having a large wild animal like this coming toward me tends to increase my heart rate substantially.If you saw the photo I posted a few months ago standing about a foot away from the moose on top of Mt Moosilauke you may wonder why I'd be so concerned about getting near a moose. Well, that moose that I slipped past on Moosilauke was barely alive, in fact I heard that a ranger put that poor moose down the following week. This moose today was quite lively and was a bit taller than my full height of 5' 9"". I was happy with the video I'd gotten and ready to move on past the moose so that I could reach my campsite, have dinner and go to sleep. Since the moose was basically right on the trail blocking my Northward progress I moved off to the East of the trail about 150 feet and then hiked North paralleling the AT so that I could get around the moose. The forest here is interesting in that it's huge old growth trees with zero undergrowth. This means that there was nothing to keep the moose from seeing me as I made my way scurrying from tree to tree in a lousy attempt to discreetly slip past the huge animal. Can you guess what happened next?Yup, the moose walks toward me, in a quick fashion I might add, and adjusts her path to track directly toward me even though I'm moving faster now - well, as fast as I can with my injured leg and all. I didn't even have time to think through my options. I knew that I couldn't climb a tree and all I could picture was my trying to race around a tree faster than this moose could reach me and take a bite out of me.That's how well my mind was working. In hindsight I don't think that a moose is likely to bite you but when that big moose mouth was about 5 feet away from me I hollered ""HeeYaw! HeeYaw!"" and then added on a ""Leave Me Alone!"" for good measure just in case the moose understood English. I may have even clacked my hiking poles, it's hard to remember with all of the excitement. The moose startled and turned away for a few steps before turning back to look at me again. I retreated back the way I had come since the moose had angled over to me from the North. Once I was back on the trail I headed further South to increase my moose buffer and give my heart rate a chance to settle down. I couldn't see the moose at this point so I dug my glasses out of my pack and put them on so I'd have a better chance of seeing the moose so that I could figure out how to get by it. After waiting 5 or 10 minutes without seeing anything I started back up the trail. I noticed the moose about 50 feet off to the side of the trail when I was almost abreast of her. Both of us seemed to stare each other down as I moved past at an ever increasing rate, in fact, I don't think I've ever hiked this quickly before. I kept glancing back as I made my way up and over a slight rise and continued to hike in ""Get away from moose"" mode for another 10 minutes before slowing back down to my normal pace. After another quarter mile I met some other hikers who had set up camp and I spilled out my story in rapid fire format realizing afterward that I probably sounded a little manic or something. Freaked out would probably describe it pretty well. I texted a few details to one of my daughters and she asked ""Did you check the ears... If the moose's ears are back then that means it's being aggressive."" ""No, I forgot to check the ears"" was my reply. I didn't know anything about checking ears and even if I did I probably wouldn't have seen the moose's ears when they are so much smaller than the big set of hoofs and of course the moose mouth that was coming right at me. I had plenty of energy to hike another few miles before finding a spot right by the stream to set up my tent for the night. I wanted to see a healthy moose and now I feel like I can check that pretty well off my list. Whew.. !","Logan Brook Lean-to

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549913,"I enjoyed hiking today and was able to take my time since it was only 10 miles to my next destination. I stopped along Lake Pemdumcook and took a short path to the beach and was pleasantly surprised to find this awesome view of Mt Katahdin. Today's goal was to reach White House Landing which is an old sporting camp that operates much like a hostel along the AT. It's a fun place to go to because after hiking 2/10 of a mile over to a small dock you call Bill, the owner who then comes over in his boat to pick you up. Bill and his wife Linda made myself and a few other hikers some great hamburgers for dinner and now I'm laying in a hammock that looks out over the lake as the sun is getting closer to going down for the day. It feels good to be here. I have more food in a box that I mailed to myself here and I also sent my raincoat in the same box so that I'd have it for the next few days as well as for Katahdin in case it's windy or cold up there. I'm getting closer everyday and I really enjoy sharing my adventure with you. Thanks so much for tagging along with me.","Stealth camp at mile 2133

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549916,"I enjoyed hiking along today with hardly any elevation changes to deal with. The one small hill I climbed had a note under a rock on the trail that said ""The view is totally worth it!"" so I went over to see the vista of Katahdin which you can see here.The trail to the shelter followed Rainbow Stream and included numerous cascades and interesting waterfalls. I've seen so many waterfalls lately that I didn't stop to take photos of them. At most I'd stop for 30 seconds to enjoy the experience of seeing and hearing the white water rushing by before continuing to hike.I made it another 15 miles or so arriving at the shelter just as the last bit of daylight disappeared. ""Looks like a full house"" I said upon seeing the shelter full of sleeping bags and pads. ""Yup, it's full"" came an answer from the shadows. So I set up my tent and then came back down to the shelter to enjoy a nice fire that was going while eating my dinner of tortillas and pepperoni. I think I'm a bit tired of pepperoni for dinner but, what the heck, I hopefully only have a few days left to enjoy fine camping cuisine like this. I'm up the hill in my tent and just saw the shadow of a mouse running up the outside of my tent. I sent him (or her) flying through the air with a carefully placed whack from the inside of the tent. Ah, the pleasures of hiking the AT.","White House Landing

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549918,"Another 15 mile day today gets me to Baxter State Park one day earlier than I had planned on. I'm ready and raring to finish this thing up. I had heard that this place had really high prices and despite this warning I paid $81 for ""one or two people"" to sleep in ""the bunkroom"". I thought that I might find another hiker to split this with (which I didn't) and I also pictured the bunkroom as similar to other places on the trail. 10 or 2 with at least a few other hikers to hang out with. Nope. I was given the keys to #4 which looked like a tool shed to me. It had 3 bunkbeds inside but nothing else. No chairs, tables, and no electricity or heat. Oh well, at least I could hang up my tent to dry out and be indoors for the night. The campground did have an ok restaurant where I managed to eat twice before they closed at 7 pm. So I'm here alone in the bunkhouse/toolshed ready to hike into the park tomorrow so that I'll be at the base of Katahdin and ready to summit. Once I reach Katahdin Stream Campground tomorrow I was going to take the AT Lodge shuttle into Millinocet but I realized that I can get an earlier start hiking if I camp at The Birches thru hiker shelter instead. That's my plan.Despite my funky accommodations It feels great to be here.","Camp near Rainbow Stream Lean-to

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549921,"I'm here at The Birches Shelter tonight with two other hikers, Blueberry Crisp and Mogly. It was a beautiful day today with a mostly flat smooth trail through the Park and a few different nice waterfalls to stop by and enjoy. This afternoon I was directed on a short side trip to see Daisey Pond by another NOBO who has hiked through here before. The view you can see in today's photo was only 150 feet up a dirt road from a parking lot that the AT crossed through. I enjoyed sitting by the fire and savoring what appears to be my last night on the trail. Two people with headlamps walked into camp and said they were park rangers. ""You got a permit for that fire?"" they quizzed. ""Uh, no... I didn't know that we needed one."" I responded. ""You sure do. It's a $30 fine for each person around the fire... I'm going to write up a warning but don't let it happen again."" It took me a minute to realize that this was actually just another hiker who was pulling our legs. ""Yea, this place has way too many rules, I wouldn't be surprised if they did fine you for something like that."" he explained to us. Ha ha.. he had me going on that one. And I don't really mind that Katahdin has rules. Percival Baxter bought up all the land and donated it to the State of Maine so I'm fine with any conditions that are placed upon us through hikers. Sure, it's different than the rest of the AT but so what?The fire's died down and It's getting cold out now so I'm going to go to bed with dreams of sugar plums and climbing Katahdin dancing through my head.","Abol Bridge Campground

Flash 52,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549924,"I was up at 5 am this morning to get an early start up Mt Katahdin. The trail started out easy enough but after a mile or two it began climbing in earnest. The wind seemed to be getting stronger the further up the mountain I hiked. ""I wonder if this is the best day to be going up?"" I wondered. I watched as numerous groups of people stopped and turned around due to the cold and the wind. I put on my down coat, my wool hat, and my raincoat and pressed onward. I reached a point where I had to stow my hiking poles and begin climbing hand and feet over big boulders.Next I came to a few places where I had to grab on to a piece of strategically placed rebar and swing my leg up onto the top of a ledge. At one point I had to hold on to my injured leg and give it an extra shove to reach the next foothold since my injury prevented me from doing it with just my leg muscles.The wind was howling at this point - probably gusting at around 60 or 70 mph. I felt quite exposed going up over the various boulders but continued climbing. Another few hikers, a girlfriend and father of a through hiker turned around ""We're not dressed for this cold weather"" leaving the NOBO to continue on by himself. I could feel a fine sleet blowing sideways across the mountain and started to notice places where ice from the sleet was beginning to build up on rocks. I would have felt better if I had someone to hike up with me, for moral support, to give me a boost if I needed it, and to be there in case I slipped and fell or something. ""Well, I've made it this far mostly on my own."" I thought while thinking that it'd be nice if my old hiking buddy Dr Fix-it was with me. (He's heading South through the Shenandoahs right now)I bit further up I met Mogly coming down the mountain. He was one of the hikers who spent the previous night in the shelter with me. ""It's pretty bad up there... it gets quite a bit worse than right here, in fact I was blown off my feet at one point in the flat section up there.""""Should I turn around?"" I asked""No, you can make it, just take your time and go slow."" He advised. Well, I made it to the top but it was a miserable day. I had pictured hiking up on a sunny day and spending an hour or so at the summit taking enough photos to get the perfect shot. I think I was at the summit for about 3 minutes. I took another guy's photo and then he offered to take a few of me. I was uncomfortable in the fierce cold wind and wanted to get down below tree line as soon as I could. It took about six hours for me to get to the top and almost that long to make it back down to the bottom. I took a different trail down - The Abol Trail - it was steep but doable so I was spared the challenge of making it back down over the obstacles I'd come up over on the Hunt Trail on my way up the AT. My wife Joanna was waiting there for me and it was so good to see her. She flew into Bangor and drove up earlier today. She brought along a special teddy bear that one of my daughters got for me when I was injured 3.5 years ago. On the front of the bear it says ""Get Well Soon!""When I decided to hike the Appalachian Trail almost two years ago I was struggling with the effects of my motorcycle racing accident. It hurt when I did anything and I didn't know what to do as I waited for something - anything - to heal my injuries and return me to ""normal.""The thought that I had back then was ""If I hike 2,000 miles then my leg will have to be in better shape... maybe I'll even be completely healed."" Completely healed.. ? No (not yet : ) This was pointed out to me by another hiker who passed me on my way down Katahdin. ""You just hiked the entire AT? Congratulations..."" He said. ""And you did it with a BUM LEG!""""Ok... haha... thanks... "" Yes, I'm still limping but working on fixing that is my next challenge. I've lost an extra 25 pounds of weight I didn't need, my legs are finally about the same size, and I can hike 15 miles without much pain or having to think about my leg for every second of the day. So I'm definitely getting better. Mentally I feel 1000 times stronger - After going up and over so many steep mountains and making it the entire 2,189 miles of the AT (despite my injuries) I know that I can do anything... YOU can do anything - if you just break it down into bite sized pieces that you can handle each day. I really appreciate all of the support that I've gotten from you and my other journal readers. The encouragement I received really did make a difference for me and was a big part of my being able to complete my adventure on the Appalachian Trail.My kids surprised me with a video that tells the story of my injury and healing on the AT. Here's the video about my healing journey. Thanks again for all of your support and encouragement.","The Birches Shelter
