"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521246,I'm not much of a writer or have never really kept a journal but here it goes. Friends and family all want to keep updated even though I tell them I'm going off the grid . I have four more nights at home before going to visit my daughters family and then leaving there to hit the trail. Thankfully the todo list is getting shorter even though I'm sure I'll remain very busy until heading to the airport. The preparation and anticipation of this adventure will soon become reality.,,View Entry,"Feb 16, Tue",0
"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521501,"Made it to Texas one step closer to hitting the trail. The past week has been very hectic getting all those loose ends tied up before leaving home the next five months. The last night in Ohio I got two hours of sleep knocking out those last minute items on the list. The only thing I didn't get to, I think, was cleaning those crisper drawers on the bottom of the fridge...sorry Kerri . Also spent the last week saying a lot of goodbye's to the people in my life my family, friends and coworkers/friends. My peeps from work even made a map to put on the wall and track my progress. Now the pressure is on! Feeling very blessed to have all the great people in my life, leaves a little bit of sadness that I think can only be cured by getting there and start hiking. Now for a week with my granddaughter and her folks before hitting the trail.",,View Entry,"Feb 21, Sun",0
"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521812,"Made it to the Hiker Hostile in Dahlonega Ga. A great place to stay...they pick you up at the Marta tram, put you up for the night, have showers, feed you breakfast and drop you off at the trail the next day. These are previous thru hikers that seen a need for this service and made it a busines. They will also pick you up at other parts of the trail and bring you back if you need a break from weather or whatever. The trail goes around this town. This one place stop takes a lot of the guess workout of what you do after you get to the airport. Duffy picked me and a couple of other hikers up...he is working here for the season then will be in Maine this summer helping out hikers. He said a hiker gave him a new trail name ""Bookends"". I should begin the trail by 9 tomorrow and the next three days look rain free.",,View Entry,"Feb 25, Thu",0
"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521993,"Had 7:30 Breakfast, visited with other hikers. Some returned to hostile after a few cold wet days on the trail. One couple had started in Alabama hiked 350 miles on a trail to get this far. At 8:30 we loaded up and the folks from the hostel took us to the trail. Me and one other guy(Shawn) went to Amicalola Falls which is 8.8 miles from Springer(start of AT) The rest of the hikers went to a drop off a mile from Springer walked a mile to Springer then had to backtrack the same mile. I didn't know what to expectat the falls but it was s hugh water fall. I will post pics later but sure they won't do it justice. Had a good hike the rest of the way to Springer and arrived around one. Signed the log book and took a few pics before heading to Stover Creek Shelter 2.8 miles away. Hey we started hiking the AT!!!! Got to camp a little after 3. Got tent set up,resupplied water bottles from creek and then filtered and visited with other hikers. We had great weather blue skies temps in the low 40s, it was breezy and cool in the shade. They had snow the day prior...just a dusting where we started but a little heavier the higher we got but not bad. On the way up to Springer you could see snow. A lot had melted by the time we got there but when you looked up it was on the very top tips of the trees, pretty cool. Well that's all for now.","Amicalola Falls

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521994,"Got up about 7am got packed up refilled water bottles and was hiking by 8. I brought oatmeal but temps were in upper 30s so didn't feel like hanging out and cooking but would rather get moving. So far no big aches or pains so still moving well. I'm still hiking with Shawn we have a good pace and get up and getting going well without really even talking about it. He is 26 and from Boston Mass. We go without talking a while and then try to solve the worlds problems a d then back to just hiking. So we get down the trail a ways and think we are going to get some trail magic. This is an act of kindness by someone that leaves something for the hikers. Several jugs of water are sitting out, unfortunately for us they are empty. So we round the corner and there sits a mini van with some trail magic. It was a couple and their two children. They had hotdogs, chips, bananas, water, apples,coffee and tea. And a grill you could standby and warm up. Plus a trash can, always good for a hiker because you have to carry out any trash from the food you have been eating(pack it in pack it out is what hikers do also part of the trail ""leave no trace philosophy""). So we continue hiking, it is odd but I have seen very little wild life the first two days of hiking, a couple of birds. I have yet to even see a squirrel. Off in the distance the Army are playing some war games, we see the helicopters and hear some shooting. Passed my ole pal Art, he was the first person i met while I was waiting for a ride to the hiker hostel. He started at Springer Mt so I had some catching up to do starting at the Falls. Good/interesting guy I enjoyed getting to know at the hostel. Probably the last time I will see him as we are traveling g at a pretty good pace. We get to camp around 3, set up tents, resupply water, plan for where we are heading tomorrow, plan on picking up more food in two days. We visit with the other hikers at the shelter,eat and go back to the tent a little after 7. We picked a good time to start,..we have had beautiful weather. Made it into the upper 40s today and tomorrow even warmer.","Stover Creek Shelter
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Feb 27, Sat",13
"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522091,"Well I've seen my first wild life...more about that later. Still hiking with Shawn, get packed up and head out about 8:45. Get a little ways down the trail and who do we see but my ole friend Art. He got an early start and had already passed us. You never know when or where you will see someone on this trail. We have been leap frogging some students from the University of ""the team up north"" that I have been giving a hard time when I see them...can't quite get them to finish up when I say OH...lol. All in good fun. The temps are warming up today and not long we are in short sleeves. We head down the trail and run into some more trail magic(tis the season for thru hikers in Georgia). This time thought it is in a Styrofoam cooler, the lids blown off and it is blowing away. We clean up the mess and I ended up getting some cheese and Shawn got a water out of the deal. That is one thing about the trail I have seen very surprisingly little amount of liter. So far one clear trail. We go a little further and stop for a break. I tend to my feet and put some mole skin on a couple of blisters trying to pop up. This up and down the country side is starting to take a toll but nothing too bad. Yesterday we were in the trees and not a lot of views, today my guide book shows four scenic views. On a clear warm day the views did not disappoint. As we pass day hikers they are always inquisitive about a thru hiker, so we stop and chat for a few. At one point I did get asked if my dad was picking me up...just a case of mistaken identity. So towards the end of the day we stop for water on our way up Blood Mt where we plan to stop for the night. Another hiker joins us and up we go. We get to the top to see spectacular views...this is why you hike. Looking over the mountain ranges as far as the eye can see. Warm sunny day had to sit and take it all in. Time to get up and oh my....a little sore. Kind of the feeling I have after finishing a half marathon. But get going and get loosened back up. The cabin is less than to be desired so we scout out a place to pitch tents. Luckily the first place we chose was too small because we went to the other side of the top and was shielded from the 20 mph+ winds throughout the night. There is a parking lot a couple of miles away so there are quite a few day hikers taking in the view. We set up camp relax a bit and make dinner. I have a pasta sides Mac and cheese and some hot chocolate. The temps are a little cooler up here and it hits the spot. I throw some beef jerky in with the Mac and cheese for added flavor. Everything taste great. I go to clean up and pick up the open jerky bag and the jerky goes flying. So I clean it up as best I can. We also hang our food bags from trees so animals don't get into them. So we get that done dishes cleaned up and we are off to watch the sun set...BEAUTIFUL!!! So then it is off to bed. I am laying there working on yesterdays journal entry and hear something moving around out there. Figure he is cleaning up the jerky that I missed. So I hear it getting closer a shine my light around the bottom walls of my tent(which are mesh) and I see some eyes peeking at me, thinking its a mouse I brush the side to scare him away and he leaves for a minute and comes back...this time I see his eyes and what I think is a white stripe on his head. So I say to Shawn I think there is a skunk outside my tent and I don't want to scare him so will he take a look. Sure enough that's what it is. I make enough noise to scare him away without getting sprayed. I went out a little later to tighten my tent strings and see him scurry under a rock. So back to bed I go hoping he won't return and shinning my light around to keep him in check. Shawn is in a small tent also and I can tell he is a little nervouse also. His sleeping pad makes a loud crackling sound when he moves and I just have to giggle when I hear the crackling. Well off to sleep...good night","Gooch Mountain Shelter
",Blood Mt GA,"Feb 28, Sun",13.50
"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522144,"Made it through the night with no more skunk issues. It was very windy but we were on the side of the mountain and it protected us from it. Hiked down to Neels Gap and the folks that camped down there said it was miserable down there because of the wind. Resupplied food at Mountain Crossings Outfitter. It is an outfitter and a hostel. The building has an exterior hallway and the AT goes right through the hallway, before leaving had a honeybun and OJ. Starting to get some blisters on my feet so I need to take care of them before they get out of control. It is another beautiful day with temps reaching in the 60s and blue skies with a few clouds. Kept a pretty good pace and stopped for lunch at a gorgeous overlook. It was so nice I was able to break the shorts out for the first time on the trip. A hiker with the trail name Slingshot hiked with us in the afternoon. Had good conversation and helped keep mind off of the blisters. Arrived at camp around 2:30 and sat and chatted with the college kids from MI. They told us people were calling Sean(aka Shawn) and I the father and son team. Got a laugh out of that. Sean was telling us about him running the Boston Marathon the year of the bombing. He had just finished a few minutes before and before they cropped the pic of one of the bombers you could see him running past in a hamburger costume. Headed to bed...rain is in the forcast for tomorrow...we will see what happens.","Blood Mt GA
",Low Gap Shelter,"Feb 29, Mon",13.90
"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522405,"Left camp at 7:45. Thunderstorms in the forcast this afternoon so we wanted to get an early start we had two shelters ahead of us, one 7.3 miles and the other 15.4 miles. We made good time to the first shelter so we felt confident to press on. About 10 miles into the hike we came to Unicoi Gap. At that pull off there was a camper with a trail angel. Her trail name was Mountain Moma and she has hike the trail and stopped to give out gatoraid and strawberries, apples, oranges, bananas. It always picks up your spirit when these people come along...great surprise. Four other hikers also stopped for the refreshments. We passed a hiker earlier in the morning coming the other direction. After a polite hello we found out he had started in Maine in July going southbound and was just finishing his thru hike. Pretty cool. We continued on and had a couple of good moutain climbs, one 3000' to 4000' and then dwon to 3100' and then up to 4400'. Our goal was get past the 4400' and down to the Tray Mt camp shelter. Made it to the shelter and stayed in the shelter due to Tstorms predicted.","Low Gap Shelter
",Tray Mt Shelter,"Mar 01, Tue",15.40
"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522406,"So the Tstorms never came but we got rain and then it turned to snow. We had a dusting but it was cold. We had nine people in a seven person shelter. We had tarps over the front of the shelter so it wasn't all that cold in the shelter. Planned a short day of eight miles hiking so didn't get started as early as we had been. Started out about 8:45 and it was cold but hiking warms you up. I stepped on a log that was more like a step and it was slick and down I went. Fell on back but didn't get hurt and didnt damage anything, so I got up and on we went. First fall of the trip...sure more to come. There were a lot of clouds and fog in the higher elevations. The icey mixture stuck to the limbs making some nice scenery. Pretty windy but calm when on other side of the mountain. Sun broke out in the afternoon. Passed a group of older day hikers...they all wanted to chat with us. We stopped numerous times talking to different people. The last one took our pic and said he was going to post it online...forgot the website. Made it to shelter around one. Hung out with the other hikers, trail names, Stan, DL, Ho Ho. Ho Ho had hiked the Pacific Coast Trail last year so interesting listening to how that was. Think my trail name is going to be Stripe, referring to my skunk encounter. Tomorrow we plan to hike 3.6 miles then head to town for the night.","Tray Mt Shelter

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522407,"Got up early, hit the trail so we wouldn't miss our ride to town. Supposed to be picked up at 9:20 and we got there quicker than planned, 8:30. Waited til 9:20 then 9:30 then ready to give up at 9:50 and the van pulled up. Not the nicest van but we made the 9 mile trip into town and it was nice to have a private room even though it wasn't the greatest motel. Turned out to be nice day to be off the trail...cold rain expected. Sean and I were both ready for a break, shower, clean clothes and town food. Got into hotel, showered , did laundry. Went to Zaxbys and had some chicken for lunch. It started snowing and we headed to the grocery. After the grocery I headed to the library to update journal and it continued snowing. I was inturupted and told I need to leave because the staff lived on the other side of the mountain and was going home. I went back to hotel, we ordered pizza and drank a couple cold beers(I learned when I lived in Ark...have to add cold and an s to the word beer). And now I am signing off . All caught up.","Deep Gap Shelter
",Dicks Creek Gap (Budget Inn),"Mar 03, Thu",3.60
"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522548,"It was nice to rest up and refuel in town. What little snow that was on the ground was melted by morning. We loaded up with three other folks and headed back to Dicks Gap where we were picked up the day before. Up in the mountains snow was still on the ground, probably a little over an inch. The trail was a little treacherous, wet snow, mud and leaves, made for a slick mess. Being recharged I was feeling good , high pressure had moved in it was a sunny day with few clouds and very little wind. We passed quite a few people, the trail was busyest I have seen it. With the bad weather many had exited it the day before to find comfort. It was just me and Sean's great luck that we pick such a bad day to be in town. Some places snow was just on the trail beside it there was nothing. At one point we picked up a few other hikers, Dill joined then Quicksand and Mud Puppy behind her. They all eventually slowed up and it was back to just Sean and I. We did pass Rookie heading the other direction... Big beard gave him away he was a SOBO (southbound thru hiker) nearly done with his thru hike south. Seeing those guys really lifts you spirit. The next couple we passed were from Switzerland, we made short conversation and continued on. A little over seven miles in we hit the North Carolina boarder. That little sign was definately a moral booster. NC was no joke though. Nice up hill climb that just kept going. We had passed a lot of folks so the path was not as clear and had quite a bit of snow...more than we had been seeing. We managed to get through to Muskrat Creek Shelter where we planned to stay. We were feeling good and had five miles til the next shelter so we decided to press on. The day off before and the weather made for a great day of hiking...it felt really good to be back on the trail. Got to Standing Indian Shelter a little after five. Got tent set up on the snowy ground, got water from the creek and filtered it. Made instant mashed potato's for dinner with some summer sausage added for taste. Hung food bag, which is called bear baging, and was in bed by seven. It was a good day to be a hiker","Dicks Creek Gap

So let me tell you a little about my tent. It kind of old school with new technology. I use my trecking poles on both ends to stand it up. There is a ridge line from pole to pole and the sides go down at an angle and there are two gable ends. It has a bathtub floor that raises about two inches on the outer edges to keep water out. The floor and the sides are connected to each other with mesh. It is made out of real light material(Cuban fiber?) And weighs 24oz. Now the problem with the tent is it is single walled and depends on the airflow to keep the moisture off the walls/ceiling. So I keep a towel with me to wipe them down from time to time. The problem I had last night is the cold temps it turned to frost. So I wiped it down the best I could. Frost is on the inside and outside walls. Pack it up and off to hiking we go. We are getting spoiled by the great weather. It is cold in the morning but hiking you warm up fast. The trails were better today, there was still snow around and some was as deep as three inches but it wasnt in the direct sunlight like the day before so it melting so cast or so sloppy. We moved pretty well and stopped by a shelter about 11:00 for lunch. The extra miles we put in yesterday separated us from the pack and we really didn't see anyone except day hikers hiking the other direction. We travel through different terrain. Some just a regular trail, some places rock to rock, some have a lot of roots and some a combination of all those. We climb up hill, on level ground, and down hill. Downhill seems the worst on your feet. Some areas you have bushes and trees around you and pretty much walking through a tunnel. At one spot today beside the trail were trees and roots between you and a major cliff drop off. We get to one place and Sean says hey look that's where we are going and points to a fire tower on top of Mount Albert. We get closer and the climb is probably the most difficult we have seen. Climbing up rocks and finding small foot holds to get yourself up. Pretty challenging and I love it!!!! Sean says if you like this you will like The Presidentials and The Whites mountain ranges when we get up north. We get to the top an climb the fire tower for some magnificent views. It has been a few days since we had views like this. We take some pics and get back to hiking. We get to camp and I get my tent out and it still has frost on from the morning. It melts off quick. We get set up for the night and eat and chat with a couple of others , Kelly and Encourager. Then off to bed.","Standing Indian Shelter

Well got an early start today, walked about a quarter mile and relized we went the wrong way so back the other direction we went. You have to pay attention going into camp...signs can be on either side of the trail so it can be confusing. So still got started about 7:30 and we are still having beautiful days. We get down the trail and find some trail magic..cold beer. So there we are at 9AM putting down a Budweiser. Sean says you have to have something to put in the trail journal. I laugh and agree. Sean is now known as ""Marathon"" on the trail. I like Sean because it is easier to spell The reason he is Marathon is 1) from Boston, 2) he has ran five 3) him and I always power up the hills and people can't keep up. One guy we had talked to tells the ones left behind we are marathon runners. At this point I would like to give a shout out to Susan and Amanda who make me run God forsaken hills every week in Sidney Oh. It has paid big dividends. So we get to a road and cross it and are walking down a dirt road that parallels the trail and come across more coolers with trail magic. This time sodas, beer and a few crackers. Marathon grabs a Sprite I get some crackers. Then Marathon is not happy we missed part of the trail so we go back to where we bypassed to ensure we complete the whole AT. We pass some college students from Chattanooga with a friendly few words and move on. At this point pretty much all the snow is gone. We make good time..about 2 mph that includes any breaks to adjust gear, get a snack or eat a quick lunch. A little later we hit the third trail magic of the day. Oranges, rolls, sodas and peanut butter cups. Weekends are good for trail magic and we crossed a lot of roads today where as yesterday not so much. We talked to a hiker that was sitting down...he was 67 and had thru hiked the trail in 2015. Hope I am in that good of shape when I am that old. We had a long uphill climb ahead of but at the time we were unaware of that...just knew we had about four more miles. I don't know if it was just that bad or we were tired. Finally after climbing and climbing and climbing we made it to a stone fire tower. Once again the views were amazing. They had pictures showing the names of the mountains and showed where the Smokies started. The on the other side it was where we had been. It was amazing how far Mt Albert was, we had been there the day before and could barely make out the fire tower. A little less then a mile later we made it to camp and got set up for the night.","Long Branch Shelter

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522847,"3/7/16Once again a beautiful day. I know rain is coming so I'll take this. It was one of the warmer nights we have had and I was able to break out the shorts two days in a row. The day started out with pretty typical trail at an elevation of 4729ft. My feet bothered me a little...it was a big 18 mes yesterday. As any runner knows you push through the discomfort and it normly goes away, and that worked today. Had two thousand feet climbs a d then it was down hill to 1749 ft. Tomorrow we get to climb back up to 5062 so it will be a draining day. I heard that is the biggest straight uphill climb on the trail. Haven't noticed a lot of pine needles until today, one place they were pretty thick and slippery. Other places had a lot of leaves on the trail, they like to cover up things that trip you or twist your ankle. At one point the trail followed a mountain ridge and the mountain droped down on both sides of you. There were trees though so it would have been hard to fall very far. Right after that there the a steep decline with big steps downward. Pretty hard on the knees, I felt it but when the trail leveled off the knees felt fine. My feet are doing well, mole skin on the blisters and wearing a second pair of socks they are recovering nicely. Staying at the Nantahala Outdoor Center bunk house tonight. A river passes by and it is big with the kayakers when the temps turn warmer. We ate at the restaurant...big burger, fries and a beer hit the spot. I did go for the brownie ala mode and it was huge and didn't disappoint. We will see what happens but trying to hit the Smokies in two more days. I got a few pics from my phone loaded but have more on camera. Having trouble getting them loaded on my phone. May have to get to the library and get them on this site. Until tomorrow","Wayah Bald Shelter

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522924,"3/8/16Well unfortunately Encourager had to leave the trail for a while...we had spent the last three nights at the same shelter and had some good laughs. Hope you can get back out there and get some good hiking in. Also thanks for the prayer and the trail magic. Going into today I knew it was going to be tough day. Almost 16 miles and lots of elevation. This morning we were slower than the average 2mph because of all the up hills. Ran into Mr Leonard, (67 yr old that hiked AT last year) We stopped and took a break with him at an overlook. Stopped a couple other times to snack and rest before lunch. At lunch we got to looking at the map and the hardest part of the day was over. We still had a tough .5 up hill but the worst was over. I think going in with the mindset that it was going to be tough made the day much easier. We had a big climb to start the day then up and downs that totaled over 4000ft in elevation gain. Tomorrow we are off to Fontana Dam, on the other side are The Great Smokie Mountains. The Smokies are about 70 miles from end to end on AT. A lot of hiking is in the 5000 ft range with Clingmans Dome reaching 6655 ft the highest point on the AT.","NOC

Interesting evening last night. A couple of guys came late. The first one was from Turkey and had hiked 28 miles that day. The second guy had done 25 miles. I think they were adventure junkies and were .miserable. Lucky for me I had pitched my tent... Which I debated when I got to camp. Marathon was not so lucky... He got to hear them tell each other how great they were. They also talked about their personal life and it sounded like they were falling a part. If all hikers were like this I doubt I'd be here. Most are good natured folks so I guess you take the good with the bad. So I went back to my tent and tried to get things organized for quicker packing up in the morning, I went to zip my pant legs back on my shorts and one was missing. Guess one fell out while I was hiking...I've been good holding on to my things til now. Well as luck would have it I would find it outside by the shelter the next morning. The good weather is rolling on, we had a nice 12.8 mile hike to Fontana Dam. The worst part was we could see it at 11:00 but it took two hours to hike down the mountains to get to it. You see it but keep going down and going down and around the switchbacks. Finally we get to the road and get a shuttle to get to the village to resupply. The store doesn't open til next week so we go to the gas station to get supplies. It has a nice atmosphere but business is slow...just us two. I order a pizza and get a chocolate milk for lunch. This place is set up for motorcycles. The Tail of the Dragon is 10 miles down the road. It is a famous eleven mile stretch of highway, 318 twists and turns that bikers love. We leave there, shuttle back to where we were and hike a mile to our shelter. Fontana Dam Shelter... aka ""Hiker Hilton"". It is nice...great view of the lake, picinic tables, bathroom with water, shower and a solar recharge station for phones. The best shelter on the trail.

It was a great night at the Fontana Dam Shelter. Left and headed over the dam...the are doing some construction on it so had a small reroute. As soon as you cross the dam you see the sign for the The Great Smokie Mountains. Followed the road for a while then turned up the trail. You have to have a permit to backpack in the Smokies, I had registered before I got to Georgia. You have to print the permit and when you get here you have to date it and stick half the page in the box and you keep the other half. Yesterday we were going down all day, today it was back up 1700ft to 4900ft and ups and downs between. Petty long day...did close to 17 miles. We plan on another long one tomorrow and then going into Gatlinburg on Sat. Staying in the shelter tonight. The only way you can tent camp is if the shelter is full. Five guys here tonight and the shelter holds 16. Good thing I had my permit because the Ridge Runner(Ranger) was here checking.","Fontana Dam Shelter

Well the rain can but it was overnight. The one problem with the shelters are mice. They haven't bothered me but you do hear them running around. They did get a shammy towel one guy had and chewed it up. All our food is hanging outside on a bear cable so they didnt get that. Pretty cloudy when we took off, we were pretty much hiking in the clouds. We got to a scenic overlook and I had Marathon take a pic and the only thing visible behind me were clouds. I guess you win some and you lose some. We hiked below the clouds and then right back up into them. We got sprinkeled on a time or two. We are pretty much hiking the ridge line. I am told depending which side of the ridge you are on determines if you are in NC or Tennessee. We did come up on some wildlife today...seen a couple of doe in two different places. One was eating, we came pretty close to it and didn't phase her that we were there. Also seen a couple of wild turkeys. I did hear a report that a bear bad been seen in the area too. Seen a terrain change...a lot of grassy areas on top of the mountains...still brown though. Seen a couple of patches of snow, even though it has been pretty warm the last few days. Right before the shelter was nice area with quite a few evergreen trees. We did around 13 miles today. We could see Clingmans Dome (the highest elevation on the AT), well almost seen it, there was a cloud hanging all around it. Tomorrow we will be there and the off the trail to Gatlinburg to resupply our food. Its always good to go to town and eat some good food. Had two other hikers, Fast Eddie, Jenna, Cloey(Ridge Runner) and Obey...good company. Oh yeah...first time I ever tried Spam was today.

Headed out, still have the evergreens overhead and a green moss on the ground cover...nice change of pace from the bare trees and the dead leaves we are used to. Headed up to Clingmans Dome...the highest point on the AT at 6655 ft. Got there and it was clouded over and very windy. So he headed on, planning to get to Gatlinburg spending the night and beading on tomorrow. The trip down was a little rough, we ran into mud three inches deep and some snow/ice that was packed down with water on it. Made it about half way down and met some hikers going up. Their shoes were clean and could even see white socks...the worst was over . We stopped to get a quick bite to eat and headed on. Passed a few day hikers on the way to Newfound Gap. We came out of the woods and there were people everywhere. This was good because we need a ride 15 miles into Gatlinburg. We crossed the street and some people asked if we were thru hikers. They were trail angels...had sandwichs, chips, cookies and pop for us. Jenna who stayed at the shelter joined us along with a couple of other hikers. Then about 30 mins later they gave us a ride to town. That was awesome....Thanks Godspeed and Mountain Moma(different Mountain Moma than last week). So we came in to town, got a room for the night and some dinner. Went a d got groceries for the next week. Marathon and I both got a dozen cookies. So while we were waiting on the trolley I offered one to a guy also waiting. We told him about our trip and he told us about some of experiences up there...not sure but I blieve he was Native American. He told us he lived in a cave and the trolley driver also told us that's where lived.

It is odd...it seems I'm always hungry and never really full. After three plates of food I figures I'd better stop or I would regret it when we started hiking. It started raining while we were eating. We went back to the hotel to get our packs and headed to the ""Welcome to the Smokies"" sign. The folks that dropped us off the day before told us that was a good place to find a ride back up. We put up our thumb and after fifteen minutes a truck pulled over. It already had two hikers in the back and we had three needing to go up. So it wasn't raining when we took off and I didn't have my rain coat on. That soon changed and it rained the majority of the 15 winding miles up the mountain. It was kinda miserable. We got dropped off and thanked them. Got our gear together and ready for the rain and started hiking. I had a rain poncho and shorts...it was a little cool but warmed up as we hiked. The poncho is nice because it goes over my pack and the rain doesn't get between you and the pack. Clouds are all around so not much for views again today. Even though it was raining it felt good to be back on the trail...I was drained before we went to town but the two big meals I got my energy back. I felt the same way the previous time we were in town...I guess it takes one meal to replenish what you lost and one to get you ready for the task ahead. I did get more food at the grocery so hopefully I can keep my energy level up. About an hour and a half into the hike the rain let up but the trial was muddy or it was a stream for the water to escape the higher elevations. We were walking the mountain ridge line and there were steep drop offs on both sides of the trail. After a few hours of hiking one side of the mountain cleared up while the other side remained very dark. When you looked out the clear side you could see the mountains off in the distance and clouds down below...pretty cool. Got to the shelter and just two other guys were there. People started straggling in and we ended up with eight in for the night. I think we all hike similar distances so may be seeing a lot of these folks. Three recent achievements 1)at 190 mile mark....under 2000 miles to go. 2)over 200 miles completed. 3)at 219 mark...10% completed.","New Found Gap

Had rain last night but it ended and we had a good day to hike, a little breezy but the trees shield you from most of the wind.

We went down hill most of the day yesterday so today it is back up. Plan to do over 18 miles...longest mileage day yet. We passed four older gentleman and talked a little while we were passing...they were from Knoxville and try to get out once a week. As I passed one guy and he continued to follow behind he says "" man I can smell you""...lol. They were moving well we were just a little faster...they mentioned one of them was 76. At this point it was a very steep climb and pretty long stretch at that. We started at 1400ft and climbed to 4260ft in just under six miles. We took short break at the top and the broke for lunch about 10 miles in. When we came back out, there were the older gentleman... they were standing there having a quick break and gave us a hard time as we passed again. They did say we were some of the happiest thru hikers they had come across. We continued a roller coaster of hills the next big landmark was Max Patch. It is a bald on a mountain with great views. Before we started that climb we found some trail magic...sodas. I haven't drank a soda in a couple years but decided to indulge. We continued on and ran into the people that left it coming down from Max Patch and they gave us bananas and an orange also...we thanked them and continued on. The climb wasn't too steep and once long ago cattle grazed this land. We got to the top and the view was amazing. 360 degrees of the mountain ranges around us. I don't remember a 360 view like this yet...if we had them it was days we were in the clouds or we were on some sort of tower so there was obstructions to the view. So we took some pics and sat down to enjoy the day and bananas. Other people were around because you can drive to a parking lot about a quarter mile away. As we were sitting there two of the older gentleman we had met came to chat with us for a while. A couple of other thru hikers we had never met stopped by also. After about 30 minutes we put our backpacks on and headed to the shelter.

It was nice to be back in the tent again. Shelter isn't bad when there are a few people but when it is full I prefer the tent. Pretty easy day of hiking, just shot of 15 miles and the terrain was not bad. I will have to say Georgia and the southern part of NC had some pretty steep grade trails, the Smokies had large elevation gains but as steep of inclines. Today started looking like rain but after a few sprinkles the skies cleared and it was a beautiful day. A hiker(Big O) from the last shelter joined us today. We hiked and camped just before we got to Hot Springs NC. Tomorrow we will do three miles and spend the rest of the day in Hot Springs.

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523930,"Well how quickly plans change. We were going to do three quick miles and hangout in Hot Springs for the day. We went to get a room at Elmer's Sunnybank Inn. It is an old home that has been turned into a bed and breakfast. They weren't ready for us and told us to give them an hour. We went to get some breakfast across the street at the diner. I hadn't been connected online for a few days and checked my phone to find a out a tragedy had happened to a dear friend. So after breakfast I made some calls and got the details and decided to go home. Now the problem is, Hot Springs doesn't have a car rental company. So I went to the visitor center to get some info. Well they were just opening the doors and told me it would be quicker to go to the hardware store or the outfitters for better info. So heading to the outfitter I ran into two tbu hikers I had seen the last couple of days. They were getting into a car so I asked the driver if they could get me to a car rental business. She said sure, so on the ride to Ashville NC I found out this was one of the hikers cousins. It was a 45 min drive and they dropped me off at Enterprise. So I went in as they drove away, seems Enterprise had nothing to rent until later in the day. Fortunately there was a Hertz across the street. I got there and a lady was turning in a car early so I was able to get that vehicle and be on my way. After about an seven hour drive I was able to make it home be with my friend. Not much I could do but just be there for her, sometimes that's all you can do and that's okay. I thank God for providing me what I needed, when I needed it for a safe journey home. My friend is grieving and I hurt for her.

I was hoping to be back on the trail today but the rental car company was closed on Sunday so I got to spend an extra day at home. It worked out well...I got to spend extra time supporting my friend and my family was celebrating Easter a week early so I got to celebrate with them. Did I ever tell you I have the greatest family? . It has been an emotional four days and to be honest it was kind of hard to leave. It was sad to leave the trail but I got to say it was just as hard to head back. I guess the best cure is to get hiking . I'm going to miss Marathon, we were a good team. He has hiked about 60 miles since I left, so I will catch him no time soon. I think I can use some time to myself just to think. I'm sure I will see many people on the trail and probably quite a few that I passed the past few weeks. Its always good to see familiar faces. It was about a seven hour trip to Asheville got down to I-40 and got some snow...great big flakes. It was piling up in the grass but the roads weren't bad.

I hate paying for a hotel that late knowing I have to be at the car rental place at 7:30. But it is what it is so I got a few hours of sleep...slept good. Got the car turned in and my ride to Hot Springs should be there at 8 AM. So it doesn't come and it doesn't come so I try calling the business. No answer...they don't open til 9. So I try at five til 9, still no answer. At 9 they answer and it seems there was a mix up. They had a 8 AM cancel and then I called and they penciled me in the book. Someone thought I was the original cancel and they took it out of the book. So they came to pick me up but it's a 45 min drive so they didn't get there til close to 10. I really didn't let it bother me...that's just life on the trail...roll with what curves come your way. Then til we got back to Hot Springs it was close to 11. I bought some gators(they cover the tops of your shoes so dirt doesn't get in the top) at the outfitter that I had also scheduled the ride with. Since they were so late they didn't charge me for the ride to Hot Springs. I tried to split the bill for the ride and they refused. So thank you Bluff Mountain Outfitters. I start hiking about 11, the trail is right outside the outfitters door, this is the first time I've really hiked by myself. It's good to get out there.   After getting out of town there is an uphill but after that it is up and down with nothing too steep. After about couple of hours I realized I had slack packed. This is a term people use when they hike without their backpack. Sometimes the trail will go around a town, people will get picked up and go to a hotel. The next day they will leave their big pack at the hotel get a ride to where they were the day before hike around the town...get picked up and go back to the hotel they were at the night before. They can do this a few days at someplaces. I always said I was going to carry my backpack the whole way. However when I found my ride outside the outfitter the prior Thursday I did not have my backpack...we drove back about 500 yards to get it. So I am now a slack packer. Since I got a late start I was going to just hike eleven miles, but while I was home I diched some gear, traded my hiking boots for trail runner shoes and I was making good time. I made to the first shelter (11 miles) by three and decided to press on another 8.6 miles to the next shelter. Everything went well and I got to camp by six. Tired and ready to eat and sleep. Oh yeah...I have the folks at worked convinced I'm a healthy eater. From 3pm Sunday til 3 pm Monday I ate nothing but girl scout cookies and scotcharoos. For those that don't know the ingredients are rice crispies, caro syrup, sugar, chocolate chips and butterscotch chips. Now that my pack is lighter I can start eating my trail food.","Hot Springs

I actually finished yesterdays journal entry this morning because I was ready to go to sleep last night. Today started on a pretty steep uphill. When you are doing it, it doesn't seem like a good thing but it does get you ready to hike for the day. Since I finished my journal entry I didn't get started until 8:45. Goal was to hike 22 miles today. One area we had to climb some big rocks and hike a ridge line. Snow was still on the ground and had to be careful at some spots. The ridge line had a few spots that had spectacular views. One side had mountain views and the other was more flat lands. I ran into Wonka...she started hiking Feb 29 and has been making good time. I think i will probably see a lot of her because we have made similar distances in same time frame..she was also at the same shelter last night. She is in her early 20s and got the name because she likes candy and she likes to sing. We had a short conversation on the rigeline and I seen her when I stopped at a shelter for lunch. Later I met Clause....he is from Austria and had his Siberian huskey along. We get some pretty steep trails but not as long as we had previously so I am making good time. I hiked the last few miles with Patch, he was at the same shelter last night also. He, like me, turns 50 later this year. He gets his name because an ash from a camp fire burned a hole in his jacket and he used duct tape to patch it. He wanted to hike past the shelter I planned to stop at and throw a tent up because last night the guy next to him snored so loud that he got no sleep. So I asked to tag along and so I got a little over 22 miles in today. It will still be a while before I catch Marathon because he was putting these kind of miles in at this area also. I think he is about 60 miles ahead of me.","Little Laurel Shelter

So I got a little way past the shelter last night. Today I would like to get 20 miles down the trail but Patch is thinking of getting to town and that would be 26 and I may join him. I have been checking the map and if I get to Erwin today... I would need 50 more miles to get to Elk Park NC by Sunday. Then I would zero Sunday for Easter and find a church to attend. The day started well, got going around eight. Around 10:30 I had a pretty good climb up to a bald(open area on a mountain) and was out of energy. I made it to the top and took a break around 11:00 to refuel. A couple of guys passed while i was eating. My energy level picked up and down the trail I went making pretty good time. I hit the 10 mile mark before noon and pressed on. Those two guys are the only people i seen until I caught Patch around 2:00 at a stream. He moved on and I got some water and ate a snack. I caught him again soon and we had some good conversation while hiking and time went pretty fast. We were at the shelter by four and decided to head for town which was a little over six miles ahead. I was feeling good and we had a lot of down hill ahead of us. Patch hikes without trecking poles and I never did until I started training for this trip. I really like them especially when I have a 30 lbs pack on my back. Up hill you can use them to help push upward, down hill you can put them in front of you at the steep places and slow your step downward. They help take pressure off your feet and knees and if you stumble they help to catch yourself. Its just smoother using them whichbis a good thing. I mentioned how I thought he would like them the previous day and he told me he never used them and he was a sceptical, thought they were just another thing for outfitters to sell. He did say a lot of people on the trail had commented on him not having them also. So we made it to Erwin, Uncle Johnnie's Hostel, by six. 26 miles in 10 hours...im very happy with that pace. The shuttle had left to take people to town to eat already but was going to pick them up at 7:15 so we could ride in pick up resupplies at that time. That gave me time to inventory my food bag and take a shower. We resupplied picked up some pizza and beer for dinner, for a hiker...life is good.. Uncle Johnnie's is also a small outfitter and when I was finishing my pizza out walks Patch with a brand new set of trecking poles. We broke him down...lol. On our way back from town, we had 14 people in the van so I didn't know who was in it. Turns out Big O and the two guys that gave me a ride to Asheville the prior Thursday were also staying at the hostel. They couldn't believe I caught them...and I was surprised. It was good catching up on how their week had been going. Most people here are going to all you can eat breakfast in the morning...think I'm going to skip that and get to hiking. Looking at 18 miles but a lot of up hills.","Hogback Ridge Shelter (1 mile past)

I finished yesterday downhill so today it was back up. After yesterday's 26 miles I thought 17 would be a snap, however I think your mindset is what makes you or breaks you. It really wasn't a bad day but I was ready to get to camp and was running low on water so it didn't seem to come fast enough. I made it in around 4:15 and was the first hiker in and six others came staggering in later. After about five miles, this morning, I came across a lady and she seemed to be doing okay but a little slow. About four hours later a guy was out looking for her. I think she turned the wrong direction when she got up this morning and wasn't where she was suppose to be. Some of the hikers that came in later helped to get her back to a road where she was picked up. I did run into a trail angel today... he gave me some lemonade and homemade bread and a chair to sit for a few minutes. It is always refreshing.

Headed out about 9:30, it was cool and cloudy. After a good climb up I stopped and chatted with a guy named Pigeon Toe. He was telling me how be brings eggs hard boils them and has precooked bacon he eats. He says people at the shelters just look when he starts eating. I think precooked bacon is going to be added to my shopping list. Stopped at a shelter about 12:30 for lunch and reconfigured my pack out of rain configuration. I have a cover that goes overy pack but it doesn't fit the way I normally pack it. Had some tuna on a tortillas and some chips and trail mix. Hiker Bumblebee stopped after I was there a while and had good conversation. She just graduated College...small school in NY and going for her graduate degree this fall. I hiked on...this afternoon was pretty much all up hill. Right before the climb I stopped to talk to Spirit of 76. She is originally from Germany and has been in the US for most of her life and resides in Louisiana. So up I went. I thought about trying to get 22 mes in today but after a couple thousand feet climb and not arriving until five I decided to stay at Roan Shelter. So as I am laying here in my tent I am hearing a commotion in the shelter....I assume Bumblebee and Dream On are battling the mice population...lol One month in I made it 377 miles, not bad considering 1) Started slow to build up trail legs, 2) Took three unexpected days off, 3) Short 29 day month.","Cherry Gap Shelter

Got moving and on the trail by eight. We were camping at about 6200 ft in an evergreen forest and it was pretty cool. I was going to hit a few mountain balds so some good picture opportunities but the winds were picking up so it wasn't going to be as nice as yesterday afternoon. After the first bald I seen a hat and remembered Dream On wearing it yesterday so I picked it up. A little farther up trail I seen a water bottle(bladder) hangings on a post...wondered why and then noticed a tent not too far away. The wind was lowing pretty good at this point and I continued on. Checking out the water bottle diverted my attention andonI missed a turn and headed up another mountain. Great view but didn't see any blazes so I checked my guide and went back to another trail and headed on...well I didn't go back far enough and ended up 3/4 mile off course. I found some people tent camping and they told .e where I needed to go. I went back and the people that had the water bottle out were packed up and heading out. I spoke briefly and was on my way. Made it five mile mark not including the detour in about 2 1/2 hours which wasn't bad. Headed on to the next shelter...it is an old barn converted into a shelter with a great view. I checked it out and sat down for some lunch and someone said ""hows your day Stripe"" I looked and said ""Dream On?"" he said ""yeah"" I said I didn't recognize you without you hat. He said he lost it in the wind...then I walked over and presented it to him. He was very appreciative. Then I want to check out the privy (out house). It had three pieces of metal 3 1/2 feet high surrounding the pot. And the view in front of you was very scenic mountain view. Both the barn and the privy are legendary. Got to the top of another bald and thought it was down hill from there.....wrong ....still had a big mountain to climb...it was only 5600ft with a 600ft climb but it kinda takes the wind out of you when you think you are done and heading down. Finally made it up and I'd guess the winds were 40mph and gusting. Quite a few people out mostly day hiking and a lot had dogs too. The last six miles were downhill big rocks and tree roots were common at the top and the trail got easier the lower we got. Made to the Mountain Harbour Hostile about three. Did laundry and went into town for a burger and shake at Bobs Dairyland and Burgers. Quite the sandwich but hikers are always ready to eat. When I got back to hostile I was quite pleased to see Patch, Pigeon Toe, Spirit of 76 and Bumblebee. A couple of them made frozen pizzas and they smelled amazing. I restocked food for the days ahead.

HAPPY EASTER!!! The Mountain Harbour Hostile/Bed and Breakfast was great. We had heard about the breakfast since Hot Springs and it didn't disappoint. They had pancakes, hashbrowns, fresh fruit, cherry danish, egg casserole, biscuits and gravy, ham, bacon, juice, coffee and apple pie to top it off. Everything was great. After breakfast I put my things together and started walking to find a church for Easter. Most started at eleven so I left at ten and found one down the road. I believe Don welcomed me, said he doesnt remember a thru hiker ever stopping by before... had me worried...lol. We chatted for 25 min talking about the trail and he had also been in the Air Force...radio man 50 years ago. Other than him it wasn't real welcoming, even though I had showered the night before and had clean clothes on. But at the end of the service they did announcements and said they had a guest from Ohio doing a thru hike. After the service people did make me feel quite welcome and wished me a safe trip. People told where they lived along the trail. A couple even gave me a ride back to the hostile. It is funny how we judge on appearance and I am no different, I just got to see the other side for once. I went in scruffy without the nicest clothes on and just felt out of place. It is funny how the people on the trail are so much more welcoming...lol I was thinking about not hiking today but I want to stay at least one night in Damascus VA and it is only seventy some miles away. The trail goes right downtown and is a great trail town to spend some time. Even though the Hostile owner said they were having a free dinner because of Easter and most things in town were closed I elected to hike to the next shelter nine miles away. Possible rain and tstorms in the forecast also with frost in the morning...guess we will see what happens. Passed a lot of thru hikers on the way up, Dream On, Mustard, Wonderful, Pace, and was surprised when I ran into Babbitt. Babitt was in Hot Springs before I left the trail for Ohio and I thought he was long gone. Got to the shelter and Spirit of 76, Bumblebee and Wonka were already there.

Still getting lucky with the weather. It rained overnight and quit around 8:00 AM. and was a beautiful day. It didn't get as cold as they thought either. I changed shoes last week and back to battling blisters. We will see what happens but can get new shoes in a few days if these don't work out. They say your feet get wider after days of pounding the trail so we will see what happens. Had a good hike, I have tried slowing down a bit...I did 130 miles from last Monday to Sunday. At one point I passed a little bench beside the trail. It was one with the cast iron ends and wood slats. It was odd location for the type bench it was. Opposite side though was an amazing mountain view. I caught up with Pigeon Toe around two and I hiked with him until I got to the shelter...he was heading on to a nearby town for the night. We passed a lot of stream.s and rivers and waterfalls. He loves to fish and was missing his fishing pole. We passed a couple of guys who had got their limit for the day and were heading home. Right before the shelter there was a huge waterfall...we stopped for some pictures. Down the trail a little further there was a cliff and a small walkway between the river and the cliff...pretty awesome. Got to camp and not much space for a tent so stayed in the shelter tonight, joined by Babbitt, Lucky Duck, Bumble Bee and Wonka. Spirit of 76 and Patch did find a place for a tent.

I need some more food and there was a one mile trail to get into Hampton and Patch agreed to go in with me so he could get some breakfast. It was a pretty easy trail into town and after we got to the road we had to walk an additional mile to the restaurant. It was just a local place and I ordered eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy and a side order of hash browns. Patch ordered two breakfasts, eggs, toast and bacon and the second meal was pancake plate. He had the right idea and after hiking a few weeks you find you can just eat and eat and eat..there is really no filling up. They estimate you eat between 4000 and 6000 calories a day so you are burning calories and you can't eat enough. I have noticed my hair has hardly grown in a month and fingernails which I normally cut once a week I've cut about a month after I started. So anyway I should have ordered the pancakes too. After breakfast we stopped at the drug store so I could pick up some Allegra, my allergies have started bothering me. Then stopped by the store to get some energy/candy bars to get me between meals. Then it was back to the trail...we didn't get there until eleven. Sad part is if we would have gone a couple of miles down tbe road we would have been back on the trail and would have bypassed a six mile(seven with trail back) 1800 ft mountain climb up and then right back down. No cheating on this trip though...I am going to pass every white blaze on the trail. So after that .mountain we crossed that road again and came to a beach area. It was a very nice day sunny and sixties. We stopped and had lunch at a picnic table and section hiker Sherlock joined us. That detour to the store and inning that mountain took more time than anticipated. It was already 2 pm and we had nine miles to go yet and the terrain was mostly uphill. So we pressed on and went around one end of the Lake Watauga and crossed a dam. After that it was pretty straight up for a ways and then leveled off some. We ran into Pigeon Toe...he is always running into a sweet deal. He went to a hostel the night before for $15 and a lady did his laundry for him for free. Hosts are usually $20-$25 and $5 for laundry. The night before that he was at a hostel and paid nothing but for the food and pop he drank.and the owner played the piano while he ate. He is a good ole boy from KY, used to work in the coal mines, outdoorsman and just a good guy. So after chatting with him we moved climbing up and overlooking the lake. It is a good size lake...we walk up and beside it all afternoon. We past Spirit 76 and finally made it to the shelter by 6:30. After dinner and got tent set up and watched the darkness set into the scenic mountains opposite of the sunset. It was a good day to be a hiker","Laurel Fork Shelter

Well the wind picked up overnight and it was a pretty windy day. Still in the tree line it wasn't bad most of the time...sometimes on mountains or in the gaps we were unshielded from it. My allergies are kinda bad so wasn't feeling the greatest getting started but pushed through it. I caught up with Pigeon Toe around eleven and had lunch then hiked with him a couple of hours. After we had split up I ran into a guy getting into a red like cage. It seems someone leaves it out and trail magic inside it. There was soda, water, granola bars, snack cakes and first aid supplies. I got a water, granola bar and star crunch and sat down and talked to another thru hiker, Mustard Seed(not to be confused with Mustard  He was hiking and also trying to raise money to start a big brother/big sister program at Fontana Dam. While he was hiking another charity organization had a hiker that had to leave the trail and asked him to carry their GPS so they could continue their fund raiser and track his progress, he agreed. They are going to meet him in Damascus VA and get him a room and some food. I left there and came out of the woods crossed a road and went through a gate into a pasture. A change in terrain is always nice. I crossed a few fences and there are ladders for me to climb over and eventually I ended up back in the woods. I was going to another shelter for my second lunch and caught up with Patch, Spirit of 76 and Bumblebee. They were getting ready to leave and I ate and chatted with a section hiker staying there for the night. I was leaving and he stopped me because I left my pocket knife...I am grateful. Knock on wood but I haven't lost anything yet. I met Sherlock and we had a short conversation and he took a break and I kept going. Made it to shelter just before six. Patch, 76 and Bumblebee wanted to put in a few more miles so they could eat brunch in Damascus in the morning but I elected to stay and camp. We were protected by the wind where the shelter was and I had hiked almost 23 miles for the day. All of us an to have a zero mileage day on Friday so if I get in a little later that is fine with me. Damascus is a trail town...the AT goes down the side walk and it is a pretty popular place to stop. Oh yeah...went over the 440 mile mark today....over 20% done","Vandeventer Shelter

Well I guess it took a day for the Allegra to kick in...allergies are feeling better today. Got up and going around 7:45...chance of rain today and I am heading to Damascus VA...and about 10 miles away. Finally out of TN and SC but when I get out of VA I'll be over 1000 mile mark so no state lines for a while. I had a nice hike down and passed the state line about three miles from town. I came out and they had a nice display honoring their veterans from all five branches of the military and an empty seat to honor our POWs and MIAs. I stopped and walked through the memorial. The AT follows a gravel path and over a bridge and then sidewalks through town. There are a lot of bicycle shops...good bike trails are in the area...one is called the Creeper Trail. I stopped in a gas station restaurant for a bacon cheeseburger fries and a milk. I went to one hostile and wasn't that impressed so when to where Patch was staying and they were full. He had reserved a private room and it turned out to be an old Air Stream camper in the back yard of the hostile. It was petty cool. So I called another place The Woodchuck and they had beds available....good thing was breakfast the next day is included. Most of the rest of the crowd I had been hiking with was there too. First thing I like to do is get laundry done and take a shower. I wear my rain pants and jacket while my clothes are washing/drying and then shower when they get done. This hostel has three beds down stairs, living room area, dining area, and kitchen. Upstairs has two bedrooms with six twin beds. We can use the kitchen if we want to cook and there two grills outside if we want to use them. It is an old house and is now a great hostil. Stopped by a couple of outfitters and checked out gear...I am still undecided weather to get new shoes or if the ones I have are getting broken in. I have had moleskin on my blisters and my feet have been feeling better. Later we went to Bobo McFadden's for dinner and I had a calzone....didn't know if it would be enough so got the house salad too. Salad was good and calzone was huge but I was able to finish it off. After that we stopped by a micro brewery and had a beer. Then back to the hostel for some sleep. The joke on the trail is hiker midnight is 8 pm. I was up til 11 til my journal was done.","Abingdon Gap Shelter

I guess this is my first real zero day (zero mile day) on the trail. I got up about 7:30 and ate some breakfast here at the Woodchuck Hostel, hung out with the other hikers chatting. A hiker named Sooner or Later came in. He had been here and was north at a shelter for about three days with a leg issue. He was able to make it to a road and came back here to get some antibiotics. I asked if he had seen Marathon and he said yes and he was moving on. Sooner or Later was a Pastor and had another business and was burned out when he came to the trail. This trail had been a lifetime dream and he was living it out. A very interesting fellow. Later I went to the library to try to get some pictures moved from my camera to the trail journal website with out much luck. I did manage to get some pictures matched up with my journal entries. Later I went and had a burrito and then went to the store to resupply. The day went fast I did sneak a nap in before dinner. Went out with the same folks as last night, minus Wonka and Lucky Duck, and had a fish dinner. After dinner I tried to organize my stuff as best I could before heading to bed. When you are on the trail you know where everything is but when you break the routine stuff ends up everywhere. You do things in different order during the day, that affects when you put them in the bag and that in itself has an order that goes with it. It has been a good break from the trail but tomorrow I will be ready to start hiking.","Damascus VA. Woodchuck Hostile

I got up about 6:40 and had breakfast at the hostel which included eggs, cereal and waffels. Packed up my things and was out the door just past eight. Walked through Damascus because the trail goes right through town. Then started climbing because that's what the trail does when you leave town. The bicycle trail is called the Creeper Trail, it was an old rail road track they converted into a bike trail. It is heavily used by bicyclists. The AT also joins it and they are the same path for a few miles in a couple different places. I hiked mainly by myself today, caught up with one guy who was section hiking and stopped at a shelter and had lunch with a guy who was just out for the day. Put a little over 21 miles in for the day and stopped at a camp site. Thought I was going to be the only one there and while I was eating dinner Bumble Bee came hiking in. We are above 5000 ft and it is pretty windy and I think its going to be a cold night. I set my tent up and it was getting hit by the wind so I moved it down hill a little farther and it seems to be more protected from the wind. Cold nights are early nights here on the AT.","Damascus VA. Woodchuck Hostile

Well it was not a good night on the AT. I may have moved but the wind kept coming. About ten o'clock one of my stakes pulled loose and my tent went down. The wind was howling good and I was wondering if I got out, would it blow away. I now know where all the leaves in the forest go....in my tent...lol. They blow to my door and when I open the doorway...in they come. So I push as many out of the door as I can and go out and restake my tent. I go to the firepit and get some large rocks to help keep weight on the pins to keep them in place. I get back in and notice the pole hoping it up is improperly positioned. I don't want a hole in my tent so I put it where it should be and go back out to get a tighten the string to take the sag out. The wind doesn't stop and again at 4 AM the bottom of my tent breaks loose. I get it put back and get in my tent and little pieces of leaves are all over. They seem to like my sleeping bag and sleeping bag liner and collect inside. Well it holds and I get some sleep. My sleeping bag is rated at 15 degrees and the liner takes the rating down to 10 degrees. I sleep in a T-shirt and shorts and I am comfortable. The sleeping bag has a hood for your head and I put it on and zip it so there is just a small opening to breath and see out of. I wake to sunlight at seven and twenty minutes later get dressed and load my backpack. The tent is a challenge with the wind but I use the rocks from the fire pit to help control it while I roll it and the plastic under it up. It is cold and some if the water in my bottle is frozen. I get my food bag out of the tree( we hang them there to keep bears, mice, and any other animal out) and go check on Bumble Bee to make sure she is doing okay. She had made some oatmeal and was in her tent in her sleeping bag eating it. So I let her know I am heading out. It is cols and still windy so moving/ hiking will be good. Most of the water I have is frozen so about a mile down the trail I fill my water blatter(soft bottle) from spring and plan to filter down the trail after I have warmed up some. So probably an hour and a half later I go to filter it and it has a lot of ice in it. The filters get ruined if they freeze so I figure its not good to run frozen water through. I get my other bottle(gatoraid) and ice is frozen in the neck of the bottle so I use my closed pocket knife and pound on it several times until I get a small opening to get some water. A little while later I see some section hikers and I asked if they knew the temperature last night. One guy said he heard it got down to 18 degrees and wind gusts were up to 60 mph. I know one thing...I love my sleeping bag...it kept me toastie. My camp site was above 5000 ft and we stayed above that for the first half of the day. One area was bad climbing up a hill and the wind would blow you sideways, but that didn't go on too long and later in the day it warmed up and the wind was not as high. I was on MT Rodgers which is the highest spot in Virginia but didn't go to the top...the AT doesn't got there and there are no views from the top because of the trees. After my first lunch(I get two, you know) it was off to Grayson Highlands State Park. This is known to AT hikers because they have wild ponies that live there. The history of this area is loggers created balds after logging it then later land owners used it for grazing livestock and when the park service took it back over it started growing back up so they got wild ponies to keep that from happening. I seen one pony but there were all lot of people around it so I kept going. I walked a ways and was wondering if I was going to see any more and finally did come up to seven or eight grazing. I snapped a few pics and pet one slighy but moved on because I didn't know if they would get aggressive, right before I left the park I ran into a couple more grazing. I stopped for my second lunch and chatted with a SOBO thru hiker. His hike is a lot different than mine. He has gone days without seeing other hikers. I don't like having tons of people around but I do like having some. After lunch I did seven more miles before arriving at the shelter. I hadn't seen Bumble Bee all day but she arrived about an hour later. Also chatted with some college kids from Hocking Hills College that are down section hiking...i thought spring break but its part of their class. Well my tent isn't getting hammered by winds tonight so hopefully a peaceful night.","White Top Mountain Rd Campsite

Well the night was much better than the night before. The temps were in the 40s and it was only breezy. The plan was to hike 23 miles because you could order pizza from that shelter. I got up and Bumble Bee was no where to be seen...her tent was packed up and food bag was gone. I got on the trail just before eight. It was a smooth trail and I passed the kids from Hocking Hills and kept moving. The trail made it easy to get some miles in. I passed a guy with his two kids going the other way but other than that didn't see anyone most of the day. By ten o'clock I was down to a t-shirt,and shorts, man what a difference 24 hours makes. The trail was good to the feet not a lot of rocky areas that twist your feet every direction. Yesterday I ran into some rocky areas and my left ankle bothered me a little and my right knee felt it too. Today both were feeling better. I'm glad I elected to stick with these trail runner shoes...my feet are feeling good. I was wearing two pairs of socks and went down to one and that seems to help with the blisters. Still wearing mole skin on back of my right ankle but it is feeling good. Stopped for lunch around 11:30 where the AT intersects a horse trail. I had pretty good terrain the whole day...not too steep and flat surface. I did run into a lady about three miles from the shelter. She was having a rough time but she was making it. I got to the shelter about four. I did 23.5 miles in just over eight hours...I think the fastest I've hiked since I've been on the trail. I was surprised Bumble Bee was not at the shelter. A couple of section hikers were here and gave me a piece of pizza when I got in. They were from Knoxville and one was a Lutheran Pastor from the Wisconsin Synod. A little later the lady I had seen struggling made it in. After six I was getting ready to start making dinner when Bumble Bee came in...it had started raining just a few minutes before and she made it before getting too wet. So we ordered pizza and had a good night chatting with the others. The reason I hadn't seen Bumble Bee all day is she got up packed her tent and bag up and went into the shelter to eat breakfast. I left out and hadn't looked in the shelter.","Old Orchard Shelter

Another cool night...temps just below freezing. Only looking at 13 miles so didn't start out until nine. The terrain was a little rockier today so the pace wasn't so fast. Made it to the first shelter and stopped for a quick snack. Went a little farther and ran into The Settlers Museum. Stopped by the old schoolhouse... They still had old desks and the chalkboard had a date in 1863 and it told about the school, it went up to seventh grade and the school year started in Oct and ended in April I believe. They even had some trail magic for us...candy bars and soda. After we left there we headed to the town of Atkins. The highlight there is a restaurant named the Red Barn....known for their 16oz hiker burger. I waited for Bumble Bee to catch up and we went in and I got the hiker burger with onion rings...it was great. I don't know if I have mentioned this beforehand but it is hard to fill a hiker up...so anyway I had the peach cobbler ala mode. It was delicious as well. I hadn't had internet for a few days so updated my journal and called and talked to my daughter a while. She informed me my niece just had given birth to a little girl. I said i didnt think she was due til April...her response,it is April...oh yeah. Congratulations Sarah and Matt. I will be keeping you in my prayers. Went and pick up some supplies at a convince store and headed out to do the last three miles of the day. Those miles went quick so I waited on Bumble Bee to see if she wanted to do another three miles. At this point it is just me and her and I didn't want to leave her behind. It is a long way between shelters so we are staying at a camp site. So we ended up doing 16 miles. Tomorrow we do 17 to get to a shelter...quite a few ups and downs so the lower mileage will be good. After that, the weather is suppose to turn cold with rain and snow is in the forecast. So it with be nice to be at shelters. I haven't seen the sign yet but I should be past the 25% complete mark","Partnership Shelter

It was a peaceful night sleep. There were no shelters in the area so stayed at a campsite. It was cool because I had frost on the tent but it got warm enough for shorts and T-shirt later in the day. My guide said we passed the 1/4 of the way completed yesterday but I passed the sign on the trail today. The trail length is always changing so I think my book is more accurate. At Fontana Dam they had construction going on so that added some mileage from even last years guide. It was another beautiful day and I'm still running away from spring at 2 1/2 miles an hour. It would be interesting to see how things have changed at the beginning of the trail in GA. I didn't see many people on the trail today...stopped for lunch and Bumble Bee caught me. Then a couple of miles from the shelter I seen a guy section hiking and he told me I was heading to a nice shelter. It is over 4000 ft made of stone and one of the few that has a door on it. It was a great view right out side the door overlooking green fields and a community below with mountains in the background. Rain is in the forecast for the next couple of days and snow on Sat. By Monday the temps are suppose to be back in the 60s. It will be interesting to see the next couple of days play out...there are shelters like 10 miles away and then not again for 24. With the adverse weather it would be nice to be close to a shelter, just wish there was one in the 15 mile range. There are not a lot of towns close by either so I guess we will figure it out as conditions present themselves. It has been just me and Bumble Bee pretty much since we left Damascus so we come to an agreement and stick with it. I'm going to miss my tent...as soon as everything has settled down you hear the mice running along the rafters and who knows where they go from there. The food bags are hung so they usually don't get much. Oh yeah, I saw Marathons post in the log book...he was here on the first. So he is making big miles and I doubt if I see him again.

It was nice to be in an enclosed shelter last night. It was windy and rained pretty hard from 12:30 til 2:30 although I believe the wind sounded worse inside than it really was. The rain stopped by morning and went outside to fog. Rain was in the forecast and I was cold so I wore my rain jacket and rain pants. After about 20 minutes it was hot and they were off. A little further down the way my heavy shirt came off and it was down to a t-shirt. I was walking a ridge line and one side was fog and the other side was cloudy but you could see the sun hitting the valley down below. That was kind of how the day went...the sun would come out and you would get hot then the clouds would come and it would spit sleet at you for a while and it would be cold. The weather forecast was for 50% rain so Bumble Bee and I agreed to hike to the next shelter ten miles away and decide to go on or stay there. I got there about 12:30 and she wasn't too far behind and she arrived when it was sleeting. We ate lunch and decided if we did go on it would be five miles to a camp site and there was no reason to get there early so we hung out in the shelter. At one point it was sleeting pretty hard and the picnic table was full of sleet. She mentioned just spending the night at the shelter and five minutes later the sun was out and it felt very warm. We decided to eat dinner at four and decide after that to go or stay. Kind of planned out the next few day also while we waited. We had been putting in some big mile days so the down time was good to have. We decide to press on and I left just before five, it was good to be rested up and the terrain was very kind. I was at the campsite before 6:30. I set up my tent and looked for a place to hang my food. Now I am in the forest and you wouldn't think it would be hard to find a limb to throw a cord over but you would be surprised. Either the trees go straight up or there are too many branches as on an evergreen tree or the tree is dead. After some time I finally got my food hung. The forecast calls for a chance of snow tonight so we will see how it goes.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

It was a cool night probably 35 degrees...had sleet/rain. Nothing on the ground until we went up about 800 ft and then there was a dusting. It was hard to find the right clothes combination to be comfortable again. About three hours in I stopped to take the heavy shirt off and a dog came up from behind and started barking at me. I put my hand out and he came up and smelled it and another dog was a little behind him and would not come close. They followed a couple of miles and I came to a road and checked his license and called the vet that issued to see if he was lost. The vet couldnt find number that was on the tag and the dogs ran ahead so I moved on. Then they started following again but by the next road they turned and headed the other direction so I moved on. The trail got a little confusing after that we hit the roads and the blazes were few and far between. But I ended up where I needed be so its all good. I stopped for lunch at the next shelter. Did another eight mile and had a little bit of snow but no accumulation. Got to the shelter and there were four other hikers there...we finally caught up with some folks. Crash Leopard, Rabbit and Strummystick. Strummystick was a music teacher and is a section hiker. He brought a guitar along and he played a few songs and some of the others sang along...they actually sounded pretty good. Later a hiker named Blaze came in after hiking 30 miles for the day. He was still pretty full of energy while he ate and we talked about the hikers we left behind. Possible snow again tonight and tomorrow and then 21 degrees tomorrow night.","Laurel Creek Campsite

Woke up to snow on the ground...not a lot but a good dusting and temps in the upper 20s. Headed out about eight. It was a nice change of scenery with the snow covered wilderness. I feel like I have a bruised shin for some reason it started bothering me yesterday and it continues to hurt today.. We are heading to Trents Grocery for lunch...they pizza and burgers both a hiker favorite. We had a cool suspension bridge we had to cross before we got to the road to Trent's Grocery. It was narrow and swung back and forth as you walked over the stream. Made it to Trents just before a 11:00 and had a double burger onion rings and chocolate milk. I was joined by Blaze, Strummystick, Crash and Bumble Bee. We were only doing 15 miles today so we charged our phones and was in no rush. Some older gentlemen in their 70s were sitting next to us and we chatted with them also. Four weeks prior I had heard a tree fell on a shelter and totaled the shelter. It landed on the front of the shelter where there was a table. Everyone there was in laying down in the back of the shelter unharmed Very fortunate no one was hurt. It turns out it was Crash, Leopard, Rabbit and a couple of others that were in it. So we are having a conversation with the locals and one says ""where are you staying to night""...we say ""Wapiti Shelter"". He proceeds to say ""Have you heard of the Book Murder on the AT?"" And continues to tell us thats where it happened. Strummystick then says ""I now feel like I am living out a scene in a horror flick where campers come into a remote area and this is how it starts out."". Well it seems the guy that did it served 20 years, got out attacked someone else and had since passed away, so no worries. About two we pack up and head to the shelter and arrive just after five. It was sunny and snowing at the same time but really a nice day to be hiking. Walking through the snow covered roadodedrem bushes was beautiful. There are three section hikers already at the shelter so Strummystick and I elected to tent camp and let the others have the shelter. We eat and enjoy the campfire the section hikes had built. Strummystick pulls out the guitar and sings some songs...he is very talented. We enjoy a nice evening around the fire before retiring to the tent. Forecast is for upper teens. I was worried earlier in the week because they were calling for rain the previous two days but we mainly got frozen precipitation so a my gear is dry and upper teens should be no problem. Tomorrow I'm going to Woods Hole Hostel or into Pearisburg for some time off after making good miles the last nine days."," Jenny Knob Shelter

Woke up to temps in the upper teens. I threw my trail runner shoes in a Walmart bag and put them in the bottom of my sleeping bag so they wouldn't freeze. I laid my clothes under the sleeping bag for a while so they wouldn't be so cold. I left my long johns on and hiked in them...I usually just have them for sleeping but I was going to town today and could wash them when I got there. I only sleep in them when it is really cold. I elected to keep the tent openings closed to keep the heat in Iso frost had built up on the inside. I keep a towel handy so I can wipe them down periodically and before I pack it up. I was the first one out of camp and had 18 miles to do to make it into Pairisburg. The rest were going to the Woods Hole Hostel but I wanted to zero and wanted to make town. When I made it to the road for the hostel I met Rabbit and Leopard...they skipped Trent's Grocery and went to the hostel the day before. The trail was clear in parts and snowy in other places. It got more sloppy as the day went on. I had a couple of really good views. Day hikers were hiking up as it had warmed up nicely during the day. I passed one SOBO Mountain Man...he had started in Aug. My shin was still bothering me but I was getting by. Made it to town and overshot the road I was looking for so I added a little distance to my day. Checked in to the hotel first time since the Apr first for a shower and clean clothes...I was ready. The temps have been cool so I wasnt as stinky as I have been. I noticed my shin and ankel are both swollen...hopefully they are not going to become an issue. Went across the street and had fajitas...ate until I was miserable. After that went to the store and picked up some Advil and back to the hotel an updated my journal.","Wapiti Shelter

It is 11 miles back but I can get a bed in the bunk house for $16 so I can save some $$$. The owner is going to be in Pearisburg so it's a free ride too. I'm not very confident I'll be back on the trail soon...I've been off the foot a couple of days and I haven't seen much of a change a feel it may have even gotten worse. Tomorrow I may try to find a way home and head home the following day.    I can handle pain but can't make it to Maine on a busted up shin/ ankle so I need to recover so I can come back and finish. This hostel is a great place it is an old log cabin and been a part of the family forever. They are into being self sufficient and grow a lot of their own food an have livestock too. They get things from the local Amish community also. They are great people.,"Pearisburg VA, Plaza Motel

Well spent the day at Woods Hole Hostel. Some of the swelling on my leg went down but it still doesn't feel right. I tried to take it easy but it is hard to just sit around...I'm probably on it more than I should be. They owners made breakfast and I was going to skip it but they offered it at half price so I went ahead and ate. We had eggs, sweet potato hashbrowns, some seasoned hamburger and homemade bread. Everything was great. One thing about this place is they give you chores...help set table, prep food, cook and/or clean dishes. It is kinda cool as it brings everyone together as a team as you help each other out. The hiker community has helped them complete a lot of different projects around this place. It is a very unique experience. This hostel has been passed down from the owners grandmother. They have done a lot of work adding on to the house, upgrading the bunkhouse, adding a shower house for people staying in bunkhouse. Raised garden beds for their home grown produce. They have cows, goats, chickens, dogs,cats and ducklings were in the batbtub when I arrived. I found a good book to read and spent a lot of they day reading. For lunch I ate some summer sausage and cheese on a tortillas with some chips and a nutty buddy. Some hikers stopped for lunch so I visited with them and read some more. Dinner came and we had a big garden salad, homemade bread, rice with beef and a gravey and cookie bar with ice cream for desert. The food is always great.","Woods Hole Hostel

So I woke up and checked the leg. The swelling was down a little but still has a ways to go so I decide its time to go home. I'll get it checked out again and heal up so I can get back healthy. I call my brother and he says he can pick me up today.","Woods Hole Hostel

I explained feeling I've had in my leg since being at the hospital and Dr feels pretty confident it is tendinitis and prescribed a steroid to reduce swelling and told me to continue use antibiotic that I was prescribed at hospital. I am to continue to rest leg and elevate with ice. When leg returns to normal he suggests a training hike before returning to the AT. I have been a runner for years and have remained relatively healthy. I've faced two injuries that have kept me down for extended periods. I didn't see this coming and thought I would hike straight to Maine. I figured there would be times of discomfort but I could push through them. ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."" My pride tells me I can do this but the truth is I need Christ's strength to complete this journey. Maybe he has other plans for me but for now I feel I am to return and continue this endeavor. I may have needed a check to remind me who is in control. Now I need the patients to rest and recover. I was disappointed to leave the trail but my spirit remains unbroken. I will return and I know I have been blessed so how can I be discouraged?

If all goes well I plan to head back to the AT this weekend. My leg is still a little sensitive but I am feeling more and more confident everyday. I like to push myself and it is going to be hard not to when I get back out there, but will have to remember what i need to do to remain on the trail. It will be interesting to see how much of my trail legs I have lost also. I am sure a lot has changed since I left the trail to include spring moving in and the vegetation growth, wildlife becoming more active and more hikers will be on the trail as I have lost my early lead. There have been fires in the Shenandoah National Park and the AT has been closed in some areas. So the hikers have had to get shuttle rides around those areas. Most will be return at some point to insure they don't miss any part of the trail/blazes. There are different ways of hiking the trail but the so called ""purists"" will not skip an inch. Some people yellow blaze...that is when they take the road(yellow lines in road) to skip a tough or boring area. I would say the majority of hikers I have been with are purists. I still have a couple hundred miles to go before I get to the Shenandoah's so hopefully I will not have any issues.

My recovery is going well. I am still not 100% but still improving everyday. I have been going out walking the last five days doing a little more each day. Yesterday I threw the pack on and went about three miles. I have to admit I woke up a little sore today from being idle for so long. Today I am going to try six miles with the pack. Sometimes while walking I feel my shin is not quite right but other times I feel normal...it kinda comes and goes and that is the same when it is at rest. The plan now is to head back to Virginia tomorrow( Saturday) and start hiking Sunday. At times I feel like I should have already headed back and at other times I feel I should give it another week. The way my gradual build up has gone I think I'll be fine as long as I don't push it too quickly. I have heard from a couple of my fellow hikers this week. Marathon is doing well....he hit the halfway point. I think it was just a day or two over his two month mark. He's said he had some swelling in the shins and said he was going to slow down a bit...I don't know if I believe him...lol. The fires are still a problem in the Shenmonth's and they are saying the trail may be closed for three weeks. Marathon made it through before they closed it and caught up with Scorched Heels. Scorched Heels was a guy we met at the first hostel(before we started hiking), I tried to talk him into doing the 8.8 mile approach trail but he was having none of that and started at Springer Mt with the other guests. I also talked to Patch, he is doing fine and made it a couple of hundred miles past where I left off. He was telling me I have some technically challenging areas coming up and water sources are fewer and not always reliable. I guess the area around Dragon's Tooth is tough. You get to climb on rocks and you have to be careful because you have a 30 lbs pack trying to pull you backwards. Should be interesting(fun). Patch is going to have to bypass the fire area, he plans to get off trail and visit the DC area. When he returns he will come back and hit the section he missed. I talked to Spirit of 76 last week and she has slowed down a bit. She plans to finish in Sept or Oct and is not pushing as hard as the other folks I have been hiking with. Well next time I write I hopefully will have some miles under my belt. Its hard to believe I've only been hiking six weeks and down for three weeks.","Home

I made it back today and got six miles in. Drove some yesterday and finished the trip today after a nice big breakfast at Bob Evans. I tried to take a comparison picture of the change in scenery in Pearisburg from three weeks ago until now but I don't think the pic turned out. I got started about 12:30 and hiked slow so I wouldn't make my leg worse. I did about six miles and didn't get to the shelter until after four. There was one guy(Woody) here and he is heading southbound. He started from Harpers Ferry the end of March and is going to go to Springer and then go to Maine and hike back to Harpers Ferry. He is known as a flip flopper and will do the whole trail just not starting on one end and finishing on the other. Harpers Ferry is known as the half way point but is about 70 miles south. The Appalachian Trail Headquarters is there and all thru hikers register and get their pictures taken and put on file. When we started the trail we registered and were given a number, but we will be assigned new numbers there. Two other hikers(Topo and Little Phoinex) came in later also heading south. One is a flip flopper and the other is a college student hiking until the end of May and going back to school in June. I asked if they had seen Strummy Stick and the college girl said yes and that he had been her music teacher in school. He taught school in Connecticut...small world. There was a good chance of rain but it held off. This evening they were gettting heavy storms north of us, we could see the lightening. The trail was mostly uphill and they have had a lot of rain so some of the trail was a stream. My leg seems to be holding up okay for now. To be honest my calves are pretty tight from taking two weeks off and then hiking last Thur and Fri.","Home

I had a good welcome back to the trail night. First I was in my tent and after a while the rain moved in and the lightening soon followed. I stayed in the tent for a while but the lightening struck really close by so I packed up my things and moved to the shelter. Topo thought I would be joining them and made a spot for me. So the storm lasted for over an hour...I nod off and the next thing I know a mouse runs across my chest. My sleeping bag is unzipped and fortunately he doesn't come in and join me. The rest of the night is pretty uneventful. I am with some early risers...they are up a little after six getting ready for a new day. I make it up and gather my stuff and try to dry off the tent before packing it up. I make it on the trail by eight. Just 100 hards from the shelter I cross over into WV for a short while and then back to Virginia for the rest of the day. I stop for lunch a little after 11 and get a tortilla and pouch of herb and garlic tuna. Open the tuna and it is like a brown gravy and it stinks as it pours out onto the tortilla. I pour it off on the ground and throw out the package and tortilla. I use a wet wipe to clean off the tortilla bag and try to wipe my fingers off. It helps but it my fingers continue to smell like that nasty stuff. I open another package of tuna and it is fine so I have that some chips and peanut butter crackers for lunch. A hiker (Farmer) passes by and stops to chat. He started the Mar 20. I am thinking I will be seeing a lot of him because he started three weeks after me and with the time off trail we are close to the same speed. We meet again at the next shelter and he decides to push on and I stay back because I don't want to over do it with my leg even though it is only a little after two. Another couple come through and head out. Not long after that a storm moves in with heavy rain dime size hail and lightening. One thru hiker gets to the shelter just as it is starting. The hail continue 5 to 10 min. After it stops hikers start coming in one by one until we total seven. They are kind of a group and been hiking together for a while. About a half hour the rain stops and they decide to move on, two decide to stay at the shelter. So 45 min after they leave another storm bits with rain, hail and lightening again. Four new hikers come in so we have seven people in a six man shelter. Later three more stop but they decide to head on. Definitely a lot of hikers out here but I'm sure it's not like it was when they were at Springer... A lot of people have dropped out. One of the guys is also fighting tendonitis, he is just trying to push through it. He is limping around pretty good. I was making big miles but now I have slowed down and everyone else is doing big miles so I think I am going to see a lot of folks (too many to remember names) until I start doing higher mileage days. I get dinner and the smell from the tuna earlier today because that's where I keep my trash bag. I think I will be able to throw it in a trash can tomorrow...can't wait. Spring is in the air and I am seeing more bugs, lizards, catapilliars, racoon's, squirls.","Rice Field Shelter

Pretty uneventful night at the shelter. Got up but didn't get going too early...doing shorter miles there is no rush to get to the next shelter. I left out and headed down the trail. Not long after I came to a stream that was very high and roaring because of all the rain we have bad the last few days. Water was rushing down and there was a fallen tree at an angle and a log beneath that. It was tough to get through but nearly impossible with a pack. So I went across without my pack to ensure it could be done then I went back a d got my pack and crossed to the fallen tree and threw my pack on top and looped a loop around a broken off branch. Went back got my trecking poles and crossed again. It was a pretty tight squeeze but doable. Threw my poles on the other side and went back to retrieve my pack. I made it but it was a challenge. After I was done a couple of brothers that was at the shelter came along and I helped them with there bags get across. I was in no hurry so about a mile down the trail a person has a zip line to cross a river and allows hikers to camp in his yard. Its called The Captians. He also has WIFI and drinks in the fridge for the hikers. So being in no hurry I decided to go check the place out. The zip line is like a swing seat and has a rope you slide from hand to hand to pull yourself across. Did I mention we've got a lot of rain? So the river is high...I make it across but I have to hold my feet up and the bottom of my shorts legs end up getting a little wet. So I get over and get rid of that trash bag with the nasty smelling tuna bag. I get a drink and try to get on the WiFi to update my journal but it is slow and won't allow me to log on. So after checking it out I head to the next shelter for lunch. Two guys that were at the shelter were there and a lady with her dog. The one guy is battling tendonitis... he has been dealing with it for a while and just been pressing on. I think it is catching up with him though. They are suppose to meet me at the next shelter but never showed. So either they got off trail or decided to tent camp. During the afternoon it starts to rain and lightening and thunder soon follow. The rain gets heavy so I do put my poncho on and was glad I did. It rains hard for about 20 minutes and then the sun came out. Ended the day with a two mile two thousand ft descent. Three other people are in camp, rain is in the forecast but the others decide to tent can and I stay in the shelter. Guess I will have to battle the mice alone...lol. My leg seems to still be improving. I lay on my back and stick them up on a wall for about 15 min after I get done hiking to help keep the swelling down. That seems to be working. I do notice a bump on my shin when it is up and I extend my foot. But the range of motion is still improving everyday. Sunday when I was done hiking and had my shoes off and crocks on I got bit on the top of my other foot. I noticed some blood but just thought it was a mosquitoe bite. Well it turned into a bubble and has popped a couples of times. My foot is swollen just a little and I guess something g else to keep an eye on. It doesn't bother me when I hike though.

I have to say that was the best nights sleep I've had in a shelter. Nice and quiet and no mice activity to speak of. One guy started a fire so I hung around for a little while before starting out. I crossed some streams and then came to an area of forest that had burned recently. Not sure if it was a wild fire or a controlled burn. I hiked a little farther and seen there was a overlook off trail so I went to check it out. It wasn't much of an overlook because the trees were blooming but I sat and enjoyed the view. Then I headed to the next shelter for some lunch. While at the shelter it rained a little so I stayed a few extra minutes until it stopped. The trail still had some wet spots but it had dried up and we weren't walking in streams for the most parts. Some of the places we had to cross streams were still high and the rocks you needed to step on were under water but it was nothing like the crossing we had the day before. This afternoon we passed the biggest tree on the AT in the South. Keffer Oak, it is 18' around and over 300 years old. So I stopped and got a few pictures of that. I seen one oak fallen earlier in the day and wondered if I had missed it..lol. Went through a couple of pastures and they are always a nice change of pace. Got to the shelter and it was .4 miles off the trail and a pretty steep descent. I thought about heading on to the next shelter but it was a little more than I wanted to do so down to the shelter I went. I was the first there and wondered if anyone else would come down that far. A couple of guys from Ohio, the Columbus area came down and then three others showed up later. There is a bird that has made a nest in the shelter and keeps flying in and out as we move around. It is a really nice shelter with a big porch on the front. My leg is continue to improve and I test it more and more each day. The foot with the bug bite seems to be staying the same no better no worse. I have to say slowing down, this has been the best week of hiking I have had. My pastor told me this wasn't a race and I said I knew that but I am just starting to understand. It is still hard watching people pass me but not chasing those big miles is nice. I will now go off trail to see things where as when you are chasing miles I would pass them by. Not sure what will happen when my leg is 100%. Its a great day to be a hiker","War Spur Shelter

It was a petty noisey night in the shelter with five of us but it was dry and I didn't have to pack up a wet tent. People seem to be tossing and turning all night and some of the mattresses are noisy when they move a d then there was the zippers on the sleeping bags going up and down so they could get comfortable. I climbed the .4 mile up hill to get back to the trail. It rained last night but stopped before I started to hike. That didn't last long though and it rained most of the day. At one point I accidentally went off trail onto another trail. There was a big tree down and I had to climb over it ....when I got to the other side I hit some mud and fell backward but was able to catch myself with my hands behind me. Then I looked for blazes and couldnt find any so back over the tree i went. I found the trail and I was on big rock faces...with the rain it made it very treacherous. That went on for a while but finally made it back to a easier trail. I was doing 16 miles today the longest since I've been back on the trail...I would do shorter miles but the only other shelter was only six miles from where I started. I stopped at the shelter six miles away for an early lunch. I had 10 miles after that but there was not a good place to stop in the rain. It was chilly this morning but it seemed more comfortable in the afternoon. I passed Audie Murphy Monument on top of Brush Mt. He was the most decorated soldier in WWII and his he was killed in a plane crash at this site. Made it camp about 3:30. The last couple of shelters have been off trail close to half a mile so it has added a mile to my day. Some shelters are right on the trail and I have seen them over a mile off trail.

Good nights sleep. I am with early risers...one hiker got up at 6 and the others were soon to follow. I made it up and was on the trail a little after 7. Headed to Dragons tooth...the hardest part in Virginia. It was defiantly challenging, climbing on large rocks and if you fall its going to hurt bad. It wasn't a large section like we will see when we get to the northern part of the AT. I made it through and at the next road had a choice to go to a Four Pines Hostel or go resupply and get a burger and head on. I was back and forth all day. So I get to the road and decide to resupply and press on. I'm glad I did...after an OJ, chocolate milk and a cheese burger my body was feeling replenished and I really felt good. I was planning on stopping right before McAfee Knob(most photographed spot on AT) but I got to the shelter and decided to press on...stop at McAfee Knob and go another half mile to the next shelter. It all went well..there was one guy up there that took my picture and I beat the Saturday crowd. It is a stone that hangs out over the rock wall below it. This and Dragons Tooth but held spectacular views of Virginia. So I headed a half mile to Cambel Shelter and six others are already there. They have good news...lol. The people that stayed the night before hung bear bags and the bears came and figured out how to get them and ripped them open. Then went to the picnic table that sets directly in front of the shelter. So they decide they are going to keep their bars in the shelter and keep a fire going to persuade the bears to stay away. I figured the bears and mice were working g together and the mice would be a big issue. So we kept the food bags in the shelter and actually there was a cat around and we had no bear or mice issues. Some of these folks were at another campsite weeks earlier and the bears tore up a tent that was unoccupied. There are a wide range of people out here....there was a guy from Germany(Spike), a guy from Israel and a girl from Scotland(Trooper). Also there were Two Socks and Speilburg.","Pickle Branch Shelter

So last night was a pretty restful night. The early riser got to me because I was up and the first one out at seven. I am planning on staying in the town if Daleville and I like getting to town early for a longer down time. I on the waynto town I passed Tinkerbell Cliffs. The trail is on the edge of the cliff for about a half mile...once again magnificent views...it was pretty cool. I stopped at the next shelter for a quick lunch and one guy was heading out. I wasn't too far from him when I noticed what I thought was a Hershey Crunch wrapper but turned out to be a credit card. So a short while later I caught him and yelled his first name and sure enough it was his. I made it to town by 1:30 and agent and had some BBQ at Three lkl Pigs BBQ. It was a very nice place and three other hikers joined me . I was stuffed when one guy asked about the complementary banana pudding for thru hikers. She came back with huge bowls of fresh made pudding with vanilla cookies surrounding the outside of the bowl and whipped cream on top. It was very good and I'm not a big fan of vanilla pudding. I got a room for the night and hung out and watched TV so I could rest the body. I am really felling good and hiking about the same speed I was before the leg swelled up.

After a good nights rest, I finished my pizza, that I had for dinner, for breakfast along with a banana, OJ and chocolate milk. I checked out around 1030 and being Sunday decided to go to church. If you remember my last church experience on Easter...this one was completely different. I was welcomed when I got there and numerous people introduced themselves and ask questions of how the trip was going. It was a small church and the people seemed to enjoy each others company. I even got a bag of home made cookies. After church I went to Kroger's and stocked up on food for the next week. I'm trying something new for breakfast...carnation essentials breakfast milk. The only problem is you need milk. So I bought powdered milk...hopefully this works out because I have a ten day supply of the breakfast mix. I stopped at a Chicken place and got a sandwich before heading out of town. I was going to do a short day to give my body an little more recovery time. I did six miles uphill and stopled at thhe shelter. Spike was there NAD bad a fire going. Soon Two Socks, Trooper, Hesh showess up and later three others.

During the night I got up to go to the bathroom/tree and I heard something behind me. I turned with my headlight on to see a big doe about 50 ft away. She seen the light and ran off a little ways. She returned and woke the guy up next to me...he was thinking bear but I told him what I'd seen. It seems bears seem to be on everyone's minds these days. Had a restful night other than that. Got up and hit the trail around 7:30. Was looking at doing 13.5 or 20 miles today seeing how the first 13 went. I made it 6 miles and stopped at the shelter for a quick snack. Went through the log book and seen names of people i hiked with before my injury sidelined me. Scorched Heels, Wonka, Patch, Pigeon Toe, Goal Digger, Strummeystick. All are two weeks ahead of me or more but I do seem to be catching some but it will be a while. I went a little farther down the trail and a deer ran off into the woods. A little later I seen either a snake or a lizard slide into some leaves after I startled it. I made it to the next shelter by 12:30 and was feeling good. I met a guy from NC mnamed Who DAT and a couple of ladies from Germany walked in. I asked what their trail names were and they said they were only here for two weeks and did t have trail names. I filled up all my water bottles because there was only one place to get water in the next ten miles and it was not a reliable source. The trail was pretty kind today no huge uphills and a pretty easy grade. We kept crossing over the Blueridge Parkway that is near the trail in this area but it has been temporarily closed so didn't have to worry about traffic but there were a several places rivht ocf it for great views. Made it into camp a little after four a d was joined by the NOBO hikers from the night before. A hiker named Stone joined us a little later. I'm feeling good and my leg doesn't bother me while I am hiking. When I try to extend or pull my foot up to extremes I can still tell it is not quite right. My knees bother me a little on steep downhills but when I slow down they feel okay. Otherwise all is going well.","Cove Mountain Shelter

So I have been staying in the shelters but last night I went back to the tent. I woke up and heard some big animal moving....a deer I hope. But it moved on and I went back to sleep. Had a light rain most of the night. I didn't get up too early and the rain had stopped...much easier to pack up tent when its not raining. Was on the trail about 8:30. Today was going to be a lot of uphills. Looking at 17 miles and over 5000 ft in elevation gain. Did the first 6 miles and stopped at the shelter for lunch. Bombadili and his wife was there along with four other hikers i had spent the night with. It was a unique shelter and it slept 20 people. Reading the log it seemed it was a good stop for lunch and few people spent the night. The next section was going to be twice the uphill we just did in last 5 miles. Being prepared is half the battle...I made good time and was at the next shelter in just over two hours. We had a little over six miles left for the day. However there was a 200 ft high waterfall about three miles from camp but it was a 1.1 miles hike off trail. I was planning on going and mentioned it to some of the others. Being a 17 mille day already I didn't know if anyone would hike it. Four of us ended up going down...Hish, Trooper, Two Socks and I. It was a hike straight down. Two socks was the first down and by the time the rest of us arrived, he was down to his shorts enjoying the cool water coming off the rocks above. Trooper joined him and I took my shoes off and went wading. We took a few pics...right after my pic I hit a slick rock and down I went on my tail bone. Two Socks was looking around like where did I go. I got up and walked it off. I headed out first and figured the rest would catch up. As I got back to the AT I could hear thunder in the background. I had just under thee miles to go and was hoping to make it before the storm got too close. I was heading up hill and had to cross an open area on top of the mountain. Not real excited about that in a thunderstorm. As I climbed the storm got closer. When I got to the clearing I ran across to get back to cover as quick as I could. There was a round FAA antenna on top and I looked over at it and seen it was in the clouds. So I thought great....a thunderstorm and I am hanging out in the clouds. So I made it back into the treeline and started heading down. I passed the gauntlet.,.a famous spot on the trail where there are two huge rocks 40 ft high and get closer as they come to the ground. A smaller rock is wedged between them held up only by the narrowing distance that separate them. The AT goes right between the two huge rocks. I took a quick picture and headed to camp and arrived safely. The other folks that went to the falls arrived soon after. I'm in the tent again tonight and very tired. Hopefully a good nights rest is in my future . My tail bone felt good until I went to sit down and I found its a little sensitive but not too bad. This is the busiest shelter I have see with probably at least 15 people.","Cove Mountain Shelter

We had a pretty good rain last night but it ended before daylight. I set my tent up on some sort of nest....I kept hearing buzzing all night but could never find anything. It was right by my head, thought it was going to drive me insane...lol. But when I packed my tent up I really never seen anything but a few holes in the ground. Everyone was up and heading out early...I was one of the last to leave at eight. I hiked with Who DAT for a while this morning. He just got back on the trail this week after having issues with shin splints. He is a big muscular guy with tattoos and a mohawk. He worked at a desk for a chemistry job and decided he needed something different. He is thinking about going back to school next spring to become a dentist. A big event coming up this weekend is hiker days in Damascus VA. Several people are going back for it so it will be interesting to see who continues to hike. It is a big party and not my thing. A lot of gear vendors are there though. Several of the people I have been keeping pace with are going back. Today I had to go to 12 miles to get to the next shelter. We were hiking in a fog part of the time and the green trees and green ground cover with the moisture was beautiful. We stopped at one overlook a d didn't expect to see much but we were between a layer of clouds above us and below us and you could just see the mountain tops around us for a pretty cool picture. I stopped about seven miles into the hike for some lunch....the next shelter was five miles further so I threw out my sleeping pad sat down and ate. After eating I laid on my back for a minute and ended up taking a short nap before a iratating fly woke me up. Who DAT and I had planned to do 16 miles today. I stopped at the shelter and loaded up on water from a stream and chatted with a few hikers. Who DAT hadn't made it yet and I pressed on. Who DAT and I was trying to make it to Waynesboro by Monday but we were both short a days worth of food. After I hiked about a half of mile I realized I forgot my water bottles so back I went. Shortly after i saw a snake slither off into the grass. By the time I got back Who DAT was there and I asked if he would be interested in going into Glasgow to resupply. We would have to get to the next road and hitch a ride. If we couldn't catch a ride we could go to the shelter and try another day. He said that sounded good. So we set out....WhoDat about stepped on the snake about a half mile down the trail but fancy footwork avoided it. We had to cross the James river and it has one of the longest foot bridges on the AT. On the other side we passed a couple fishing and asked if they were having any luck. They said not really. We got to the parking lot and two couples were getting ready to cross the bridge and asked if we were thru hiking. We said yes and they asked if we would like some food. I said a true thru hiker wouldn't turn it down. They brought out sandwiches, rice cakes,, cheese, soda, fruit and brownies and told us to take it all they had just got done eating. We tried to leave some but they insisted we take it. We talked for a good 20 minutes. We started to hear some thunder. They headed for the bridge and we went to hitch a ride. After a couple cars passed us by the people fishing came up and said they would drive us the six miles into town. So we got a ride in...the town has a place you can tent camp for free with a hot shower. So we spent the night and I was able to update my journal. We had a few light ran showers throughout the day but it was a great day to be a hiker","Thunder Hill Shelter

I woke up it was raining but it didn't last long. I saw Farmer at the village tent site and his leg looked swollen like mine did a few weeks ago. It seems at this point everyone is dealing with something. The plan for the day was to be out on the road between 7 and 8 so we would have a higher volume of cars to hitch back to the trail. First we took pictures with the 25 ft long dinosaur in the middle of the village. Not sure of why they have it. We tried hiking in town without much luck so we hiked a half mile to the road we actually needed to be on. After about 15 minutes a young man in his 20s stopped...he just got off work and drove us the other 5.5 miles over a mountain. We got to the trail with a plan to do 20 miles. We added two because we didnt get the two miles to the shelter we planned to go to yesterday. I stopped at the first shelter to fill up on water. Then I had a five mile climb up a mountain. I hiked up into a cloud and again the green of the trees and ground cover were vibrant from being wet and the way the light hit them it looked like rain forest. And the fog added a bit of mystery. I doubt pictures do it justice. At one area all the ground cover was two feet high that's all you could see with a small trail cut through the middle of it and the tall trees above. I got to the top of the mountain and ate lunch. Ralphie(looks like kid on A Christmas Story movie), Criss Cross, Sun Ray and WhoDat joined me. Rumor of the day was a guy was tent camping in the Smokey's and a bear bit him on the leg...he got out of the tent and the bear went back and pillaged through his tent. They took the guy out on horse back and he is going to be alright. After hiking a while in the afternoon, I started feeling a little pain in my left knee. I slowed down and took shorter steps and after awhile it seemed to go away but my shin became a little sensitive(opposite shin that sent me home). I think we pushed a little too hard and WhoDat, Ralphie and I were all worn out by the time we got to camp at six. There were ten folks at the shelter. The three of us pitched tents down by a big creek with one other guy. It was a pretty sweet campsite. Tomorrow starts with a five mile 3000 ft climb, for the second day in a row. Oh yeah...passed the 800 mile mark today. It was a beautiful day for a hike","Glasgow VA

We had a pretty hard rain last night but everything in the tent stayed dry. Everything is just kinda damp and could stand some dry weather to dry out. Got in a little late yesterday so didn't head out til 8:30 today. My body was feeling good but my energy level was low. I don't know if it was the long day yesterday, the dampness or just knowing of the five up hill miles that laid ahead. I got going and really didn't make bad time though. A lot of scenery like yesterday. The clouds/ fog moved in and out during the morning. I stopped for a break at an overlook...at first it was all fog then it would push on and you could see the mountain ranges in the distance and then the fog would move back in. This happened numerous times while I sat there. There was a pretty good wind and it was cool on the side of the mountain with the wind. The clouds lifted and I hit a mountain bald and I could see the mountain ranges on both sides for about a quarter of a mile. I ran into a guy who was just starting a thru hike...he was slack packing(only had small pack, his pack with all his gear was at a hostel). Started to talking to him and he had just had knee surgery ten weeks earlier. He was going to do what he could and not push it. I stopped at a campsite for lunch and it was kinda cool sitting there. About 20 minutes later I started hiking and the sun came out and was with us the rest of the day. It was little ups and downs throughout the afternoon. My energy level had risen since lunch and both my legs were still feeling good. I stopped at the next shelter for a short break and didn't see any good camp sites so pushed on another mile where there were good campsites and a water source. I got there at 4:30 and was able to hang up all my damp clothes/towels/sleeping bag to dry and air them out. Sparky showed up shortly after...this was the first time I met him. He is from England. We had a fire to clear some of the bugs out and had dinner. I went to lay down and WhoDat showed up around eight. The skies cleared out and didn't even see any clouds by the end of the day...hopefully we move into a drier weather pattern. Another enjoyable day of hiking.","Brown Mountain Shelter

Had a good nights sleep with no rain. Today was a big 19 mile day with a big down hill and then turn around with a big up hill. I took off before WhoDat and climbed a hill and turned right in to a camp site when I should have turned left. I thought I was going to have to go back down the hill but found a faded blaze and was on my way. WhoDat caught up with me by then and we hiked together figuring out the worlds problems. Water has been a little more scarce so I have to pay attention where I can get it. It was a sunny day and I had a few real nice mountain views. We seen a lot of weekend hikers out...the trail was busy. After we finished our down hill that seemed to last forever, we crossed a suspension bridge and stopped at a clearing by the water for lunch. While we were sitting there a group of trail maintainers passed by heading south. These folks are volunteers and keep the trail in good shape, whether it is cutting trees that have fallen onto the path, trimming the weeds and grass that protrude on the trail, making pathes for rain water to exit the trail,, working on steps or working on shelters, these folks do a tremendous job. After lunch we started the up hill. A few miles in we stopped at a shelter to resupply on water. There was a group there out for the weekend we chatter with and the back to the trail. The climb wasn't too bad and when we thought we got to the top we stopped for a break. Turned out we had another mile to go until we reached the top. Rain moved in but nothing too heavy but it came and went as we hiked. The clock seemed to move fast today and we got to the shelter around six. Once again there were some weekend hikers there and we chatted with them while we had dinner. The rain had stopped and it had cooled off.. The campfire they had built felt good. Not much later it was off to set up the tent and hit the sack.","Rock Spring campsite

Brrrrr...it was a cold night. I was cold but didn't realize how cold it was. The wind was blowing all night probably up to 40 mph. Later I found out the temps dipped down to 38 so no wonder I was cold. Tonight it is suppose to go down to 34 but the wind stopped blowing so it shouldn't be so bad. I slept well just cold getting out of the sleeping bag and things packed up. I hiked with WhoDat most of the day...he keeps a slow steady pace and I think it is good for minimizing injury. A Coue of miles in we found a trash can at a parking lot...packing our trash out thru hikes love coming across trash cans. We went a little further and found a cooler marked thru hikers only....cool trail magic....nope...only thing left was empty tea bottles. We kept moving and had several beautiful overlooks. On one side of the mountain the terrain really starts to flatten out. It was a cool day but very pretty. WhoDat took a little longer for lunch and I pressed on. I came around one corner and there stood a doe 50 ft infront of me on the trail eating. I stopped she looked at me and then turned and continued eating. I pulled my camera out and took a couple pictures. I then told her I was coming through and started walking. She went about 20 yards off trail and then returned after I passed. No big hills today so the hiking was nice. Being the weekend there were lots of day hikers out. One group were volunteer trail maintainers.. I talked to them for a while and moved on. I went to one scenic view and had it to myself so I just sat down and enjoyed it for about 20 min until a couple stopped by. I headed to the next shelter and was joined by Riser, AB on the AT,,Black Bear and WhoDat. We ate and WhoDat and I was going to head to the next campsite and go to Waynesboro tomorrow. We never found a campsite so we went to the next road. On the guard rail there was a lost of trail Angeles that would give you a ride to town. WhoDat called a guy(Tim) and he said he would be right there. Not long he was there and have us a ride to the YMCA camp site where thru hikers can camp for free.

Another cool night into the 30s. It was damp too a lot of dew on the ground and my tent. I decided I'd go to a hostel tonight..the local church has a free one but I'd be running all over town to get my laundry done and shower so I'd get more rest at the $25 hostel plus that would include laundry and ride back to the trail. The bright sun came up and dried things quickly. I went to the library and tried to load pics and after an hour the pics were huge and you had to scroll the page to see them. I deleted them and went to Kroger's to resupply and then Ming's Chinese for all you can eat lunch. After that I went to the hostel and was able to get my journal to include pics uploaded. Petty good zero mile day. Tomorrow I start the Shenandoah National Park. It is suppose to be smoother trails but there will still be some ups and downs. Most people make good miles... I will take it as it goes. The opposite leg I had trouble with sometimes feels like it's getting shin splints but when I slow down it goes away. Its usually more noticeable on big mile days. 100% chance of rain tomorrow and then changes go down the end of the week. My journal was wrong on mileage... I should be around 861. Everyone has that 1000 mile in site and are ready for it and to say goodbye to Virginia. It was a beautiful day to hike but I'll take the rest.","Waynesboro VA (YMCA TENT CAMP)

Got a good nights sleep at the Hostel. Three of us were heading out to hike...Black Bear, Riser and myself. Had a little breakfast, got my stuff together. It was raining...its hard to leave a nice warm house for a rainy day but we did it. We had a mile to go and then we would be in the Shenandoah National Park. They say the terrain improves at this point....getting away from the five mile 3000,ft elevation change and the path is smoother. But first we have to register. More less you just have to sign in and let them know what dates you will be in the park. The trail was rocky at first but after a few mes smoothed out. The rain came down most of the day but lightened up in the afternoon. I did fall at one point my foot slid on a wet rock and I couldn't get the other foot to catches me before I went down. I got a small cut on the finger and it took a while to get it to quit bleeding with the rain hitting it. About seven l
Miles in I went to the shelter .3 miles off the trail. Normally that far off trail I keep going but with the rain I went in to eat. Met a couple of section hikers....they had just retired and came out for ten days. They didn't pick a very good day to start but the weather is suppose to improve as the week goes on.The terrain had improved and I was able to make good miles. Ended up with just over 20 and in at camp at 4:30. In the Shenandoah s what used to be called shelters are now called huts. The term shelter is now used for a daytime.e picnic area. There were a lot of people at the shelter which surprised me...at least 12. With a rainy night it was an early night...the sleeping bag felt good.","Waynesboro VA (Stanimal Hostel)

Didn't get hardly any rain during the night, so the tent was dry and ready to pack up. Made carnation essentials breakfast drink...I messed up when shopping and bought the light instead of the regular. You don't want anything that says light when it comes to eating. Got on the trail just before eight. The trail was pretty kind this morning...smooth and not a lot of real long ups and downs but shorter ones. The deer are really coming out...I ran into three standing on the trail today. One almost distracted me from making a turn to stay on the the AT. In the Shenandoah's they have campgrounds you have to pay to stay at and then the huts where we stay. Around the campgrounds they have stores and Waysides. Wayesides are a place you can buy gifts and food. We passed one at Loft Mountain and I stopped for a burger fries and a blackberry shake. It was good and gave me energy for the afternoon. They are about every 20 miles or so...might hit another one tomorrow. I ran into another deer on the way back to the trail. The Wayside was about a half mile off the trail. It was cloudy all day but didn't see much rain...just a short drizzle. That was a good thing as I tore my pack rain cover putting it on this morning. Hopefully I can get a new one for free...most of the good companies will replace gear that fails if you are doing a thru hike. It seemed we had a few more ups and downs this afternoon but all in all they werent too bad. I got to camp just before five. One guy said he seen a bear and her cubs when he was leaving the wayside. Another guy seen one a few miles before camp. I guess the wildlife is really coming out now. I passed on area that burned a few weeks ago. They shut the trail down for a few days because of it. It wasn't too big....I was expecting to see more damage. The brush and ground cover burned but the taller trees remained. It was was pretty quiet with little wildlife or birds in that area.

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534129,"5/19/16Well the weather forecast was wrong...it rained off and on during the night but it stopped by morning. Not sure where I was headed today, a hut at 12 miles a campground I would have to pay for at 20 and then a hut at 24. So I would see how I was feeling during the day and go from there. Started out foggy and mid morning the clouds lifted and it was cloudy for most of the day. The trail was nice, smooth with gradual inclines and declines. An occasional rock bed for a short period but soon would turn back to dirt or gravel surface. I came to a turn off for a spring and acabin a little after eleven. The cabin was empty so I sat at the picnic table and had lunch. Uncle Bob a hiker I met in the morning came and joined me. He had been traveling all over the world and decided to give the AT a try. He was making good time and plan to finish in five months before his visa ran out. After lunch I headed to the spring to fill up my bottles and then back to the trail. I was feeling good and moving fast. About 40 minutes in to it I ran into a guy that was at the shelter last night. I didnt recognize him but he did me and said..,.one of us is going the wrong direction. We compared times we left the shelter and I had turned south after I left the spring So I turned around and started heading north. I told him he was an alright guy but didn't care much for his hat as he was supporting Michigan State. I told him I was a Buckeye fan and he said he didn't meet a Buckeye fan he didn't like to include me. I was moving faster and pulled away from him. An hour and fifteen minutes after I left I was back at my lunch location. How aggravating but what is done is done. I passed the next shelter and it was only 2:30 soni pressed on. The key here was there was a Wayside which means a hamburger about eight miles away... Figured I could be there by 5:30 and decide what to do from there. So I am climbing this hill and something big moves on the right side of the trail....my first bear sighting. He is about 40 yards away so I look around to make sure there are no other bears and then back at him to ensure he is staying put. He is looking the other direction so I pull out the camera and take a picture as he looks back at me. I head on and s ap one more from farther away. What I don't know is the trail circles around...so I continue around it and he watches me but then I head off and he goes back to doing his thing. It seems after I get to the top of the hill I have a gradual downhill that lasts forever. I am moving fast and make it to the Wayside by 4:30. I eat and figure I have time to make it to the hut just a little over four miles away. The sun has come out and I am treated to some nice views on the way. I make it by seven and get my tent set up and go get some water. I have to pass a cabin that is empty and stop for an amazing sunset view. I get my water a d filter it and am ready for bed after a long day. Tomorrow is suppose to be nice and then j hear a lot of rain on Saturday. We will see what happens.","High top Hut

Well after the sunset last night I went back to the shelter before heading to my tent. Talking with the other hikers and mice started running around the picnic table and then up into the shelter. I never have seen them like that...usually they wait til everyone is quiet and then you hear them run. I return in the morning to see how it went and everyone moved out of the shelters and into their tents. We finally got a clear day to hike in the Shenandoah National Park and was treated to amazing views all day. Either we were hiking and could see the views or take a short path off path to see the scenic views. The problem with the Shenandoah s is the Waysides(places to eat) are too close. I stopped and had a sandwich today at Big Meadows Wayside. I stayed in the lobby and got a sandwich. Before I left I looked in the dinning room and the whole side wall was a window with a spectacular view. I finished hiking and arrived at the hut(shelter) there were three other hiker..older gentlemen ( DrG, Curious George,?). We talked and I enjoyed their company. Hiker(Black Bear) came in a little after me. I ate dinner and went to get some water so I could brush my teeth and for the next day. The spring is 15 feet behind the shelter and I see something behind that scurry up the hill and then I see mother bear right behind the spring. I back up and let the others know the bear is there and they come around to watch her. After a while she leaves but later comes back. One guy claps at her and she takes off. It starts raining and we don't see them again. We all planned to stay in the shelter before all this happened because rain was in the forecast.","Rock Spring Hut

No more trouble from the bears but we got a lot of rain overnight. I headed out a little after seven hoping to do 23 miles. If the weather was too bad I would stop at 13. It was a light rain before I took off and the trail was pretty sloppy. I made good time and stopped at a wayside for breakfast. This was the first wayside without a place to sit and eat. Being a rainy day, no one was there and they told me I could stay in and sit by the fireplace. I ate and got back on the trail. The rain had mostly stopped and it wasn't a bad day to hike other than the trail was very muddy. I made pretty good time. About four miles before the shelter I hear a big noise and a bear was ahead on the trail and moved to the side. He wasn't far off but I kept walking and he took off running the other direction. I arrived at the shelter to find four section hikers. The forecast was for rain but I went ahead and pitched the tent. I needed water and I found out it was like a quarter mile down hill and even then it was just a trickle. We had dinner and had good conversation. I went back to my tent to find my phone had crashed. All my apps and contacts and shortcuts were gone. So I did have internet access and after some time was able to find my backups and got things back into some order. I lost a day of journals so had to redo yesterdays. My left foot is bothering me a little so thinking about going to hostel tomorrow and resting it.","Pass Mountain Hut

Got more rain during the night. Woke up and got packed up...think I'm going to take it easy today...left foot still bothering me. Didn't plan to stop but did over 100 miles in five days and I have learned pushing through is not always the best policy. I need to resupply anyway. I passed a couple that started hiking but with the rain and the mud turned around. They offered to give me a ride 3.5 miles into Front Royal. I stopped by a hotel and was going to stay but they didn't have a place to do laundry so I elected to go to a nearby hostel. I called and he gave me a couple of hours to eat and resupply. He picked me up and I went to the hostel for the day. After I got to the hostel I found I misplaced my cooking pot/stove. I believe I left it at the shelter last night but may have set it out when I was putting my food in my bag at the grocery. Hopefully it will turn up. Two guys were heading out from the hostel were going to be passing the shelter I stayed at and were going to check to see if it was there and put my name on it if they found it.

Before i went to sleep last night i couldn' t find my headlamp... I looked for it for about an hour going through all the pockets in the backpack, pulling everything out and checking them twice. I even unrolled my tent to see if I had rolled it up inside. I finally concluded it was with my cooking pot. As I went to bed I found it tangled up with my compresion bag straps. It is a waterproof bag that has straps and you can tighten the straps to compress the contents to save room in your backpack. K keep sleeping bag and sleeping clothes in mine. I slept well at the hostel and got up around seven. I didn't pay the bill last night so bad to wait around til about nine. My left foot was still a little swollen so I iced it while I was waiting, also ate an apple and cookie for breakfast. I sat and talked with Dr G, Curious George and one of the young ladies that came in last night. She is just hiking 10 more days and then going to a summer job and then starting law school next fall at the University of Kentucky. So today j am going to hike 1.5 miles from the hostel to the last shelter I stayed at to look for my cooking pot and stove. I will then walk the three miles I did yesterday to get back to where I should be starting today. The mile and half go surprisingly quick. As I approach the shelter I see two older gentleman packing up to leave. I asked if they had seen my cooking pot and they said no. I looked at the place I packed my bag and it was not there...as I turned towards the picnic table....there it was sitting underneath it by the leg. What a relief...didn't add all those miles for nothing. I stayed and talked to the gentlemen(section hiker)for a while. One asked if I knew anything about the smart phones....he didn't know how to take pictures. So I showed him and he was appreciative and asked to take a picture of the two of them together...so I did and then he wanted/took my picture. So I am on my way in a good mood with my cooking pot back in my possession. There are a group of five older guys ahead but I slow down because I passed them once before and when I stopped at the shelter they passed me. We came to a road about the same time and they found some trail magic...coke in a cooler. They didn't take any but I had one and they had a truck parked there and gave me a couple of rolls. They were section hiking and out for five days. I have to admit I enjoy chatting with the older folks. So at this point I had walked 4.5 miles and was back to the place I had left off yesterday. But I had ate a lot yesterday and with the coke and rolls...I was ready to go. The sun was actually out today...but evidently as I sat inside the day before we had gotten a lot of rain. The trails were as sloppy, muddy, streams as bad as I had ever seen. I slipped a couple of times but caught myself with my hands. I finally realized the best thing to do was walk right in the middle of the trail no matter how messy it was because the erosion had already taken place and you were stepping onto something solid. My shoes and legs were a mess but I made pretty good time like that. I came to the nicest shelter I think I have seen out here yet. It had a shower, porch, nice bench, and a horseshoe pit with horse shoes. After a quick break I hiked on and caught up with Dr G. He was going g kinda slow so I slowed down a hiked with him for over an hour. He stopped for a break and I kept going for the next shelter. He caught up and we both decided to go another five miles to the next shelter. We made it by six... The shelter was full so we set up tents. I needed to anyway because whenni packed it up two days ago it was raining and still wet. So cleaned up, ate and headed to bed. I did close to 20 mes but only got credit for 15 miles. My foot felt good most of the day but started feeling it the last mile and a half. So hopefully I didn't over do it...tomorrow looks to be a 15 mile day. We will see how it goes. It was a great day for a hike","Front Royal VA (Front Royal Hostel)

I got a good nights sleep. It was nice to wake up and see the sun and not having everything damp. Going to try to geg 15 miles in today so wasn't worried about too early of a start but was packed and ready to go a little after eight. On my way out of camp I saw a turtle so I stopped to take a picture and my camera was acting funny....but got the pic and headed on. Walked out of the big stream to get out of camp. When I got to the trail an older lady that stayed in the shelter was sitting down. I believe she was in her eighties and she had an accent. I asked where she was from and I believe she told me Zimbabwe. I kept moving and their was a hiker behind me and she was from Quebec. So hiked down the trail a little ways and had to pass the stream again. It seemed as if the stream and the trail were the same for quite a while. Not sure if this is normal or just because of all the rain they have been having. The trail was still sloppy in places but better than yesterday. I have been taking advil the last couple of days and my foot that was a little swollen was now feeling good again. I hiked a few miles and I caught up with Dr G. We hiked together for most of the morning. We ran into five guys I had passed the morning before that were section hiking. They were coming towards us. Stopped and got Intel on the trail ahead and told them what we had been hiking through. Dr G and I stopped for lunch at the next shelter. We really haven't been seeing many hikers the last few days...wondering where all the hikers went. After lunch we were going to start the roller coaster. It is a 13 mile stretch of ups and downs of about 250 ft. I'm a little faster and pushed on ahead of Dr G. We were doing half the roller coaster today and the other half tomorrow. There is a shelter right in the middle. All and all it wasn't too bad but did slow me down a bit. At one point I was coming down hill pretty quick and a snake scurried off just before I stepped on him. I made it to camp around 4. A little later than I planned but thats okay. There were a few hikers there Two Ton, Jester, and Wild Turkey. Jester and Wild Turkey left and Dr G arrived. A pretty light crowd tonight as one other section hiker arrived. This shelter is just shy of the 1000 mile mark...999.6. So tomorrow we hit 1000 and the next day I should be out of Virginia. I was in Virginia the last day of March and just now leaving....of course I was off with an injury three weeks...but still. Many hikers refer to getting the Virginia blues we are here so long. It was a nice day with no rain. The temps are suppose to be hitting the mid eighties by Thursday with a chance of afternoon thunderstorm....well that's the last weather forecast I have heard. Hiking was so fun...I think I'll do it again tomorrow","Dicks Dome Shelter

I woke up a little after five today after sleeping well. Got up and hit the trail a little after seven. After a half mile I came to the 1000 mile marker...it felt good to see that...90 more miles to the halfway point. I stopped and took a few pics and headed on. I caught up with Dr G shortly after. We still had six miles left of the ups and down section they call the roller coaster. About three miles into the day we came to the Bears Den Hostel. We didn't need to stop but it is considered ""A place not to miss"" on the trail. It was only a little off trail so we went to check it out and get a soda/pop. A Dr had it built in 1933 and it looked like a castle. A development company bought it but couldn't get the permits required and after 20 years of being abandoned it was turned over to The Appalachian Trail Conservancy. In the 1980s the land was used to take the AT off the highway and they built the roller coaster. The castle like structure is now used for a hostel for thru hikers and the up stairs is used for other functions. It even has a rock wall that goes around it. I found Falling Upward there...he was at the shelter I had lost/found my cook pot at. Before we finished the roller coaster there was one other highlight...we would enter West Virginia. After being in Virginia over 540 miles(over a quarter of the total miles of the AT) we were going to move into another state. We are in the Virginia sooo long some hikers refer to it as getting the Virginia Blues. I took a couple of pictures with Dr G and we pressed on to finish the roller coaster. After finishing the roller coaster we stopped for lunch. The rest of the days trail was a lot easier...mostly downhill and smooth although we did have some rock beds/ankle twister sections to navigate through. We got to a shelter around four and decided to push on a few more miles so we could get into Harper's Ferry earlier tomorrow. A lot of history in Harper's Ferry so I an to spend one night and checkout the town and maybe two. It may be time for some new shoes too. I could probably get a few more miles out of them but not sure when I'll get the chance to get to an outfitter with a good selection. The weather is turning warmer I heard it was in the mid 80s today. The AT is considered the ""Green Canopy"" because you are usually under tree cover so the heat to day was very bearable. The bugs are starting come out a little more but not terrible yet. Another great day with no rain.","Sam Moore Shelter

It was a warm night... I left the front of my tent open for air circulation. After a while I closed the front....its amazing how much that thin material gives you a sense of security...lol. Was up and heading to town by 7:30. The path was a little more rocky than I expected. Dr G took off before me but I'm a faster hiker and would catch him. Had to pass one busy road and it was rush hour....after I was across I was looking down the road and stepped on something...looked down and it was a deer leg. Poor fella had been hit/killed by a car. I hiked into town with Dr G and Black Bear caught up with us...he had been off the trail a few days with his uncle and getting off a few more days in Harper's Ferry to visit DC. We came out of the woods and had to cross the Shenandoah river..it was a long bridge. It felt good with cool breeze and light backpack(not much food) and knowing a restaurant was not far away. I almost felt like jogging. The first stop though was the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Center to get our picture taken out front and they register and put our picture in the book. I was number 312...I was looking and seven days ago they were only at number 225, so a lot of hikers are in the area. It was nice to look through the book and see the folks I had hiked with in the past. Marathon was one of the earlier hikers to make it here. Went to check in the hostel but couldn't get in until two so we went to the pizza place. Now to tell you how big this town is....the post office, police station, city hall and the liquor store are all in the same building. At the pizza place I asked if they had beer they said no but I could go to the liquor store and bring it back. I stuck with a water. Went back to the hostel and sat in some chairs under the tree until we could get in. Tried to eat a snickers bar I had packed but it had melted. Guess that's something to consider with the summer heat arriving. There is a lot of history here and they have a lower part of town with old historic buildings. The Lutheran church was used to warn the people of trouble coming during the civil war and they claim a cannon ball from Maryland over a mile away hit the church. It had to be a crazy time in American history. We walked down to the lower part of town...they are set up with shops for the tourists and have a lot of cool buildings. They have an outfitter I planned to look at shoes but they had a very small selection. The restaurants down there were a little pricey for a hiker so we came back closer to the hostel and ate at the Anvil. Then went to 7-11 for ice cream and back to the hostel. The hostel was full 16 people.","Camp Festis (camp ground)

Well I was thinking of taking a zero mile day in town but unable to resupply here and lack of hiker support I decided to hike on. I had seen a section hiker, Falling Upward several times during the week and he stayed at the hostel with us last night and went to dinner with me and Dr G. His car was at the hostel and he kindly volunteered to drive us five miles to Charles Town to Walmart to resupply. The hostel came with a waffle breakfast so after breakfast we went to resupply. I was on the trail by 9;30 and a couple of miles down the way I was in Maryland. I crossed the Potomac bridge and that is where the Potomac and the Shenandoah rivers connect. I walked a bit further and had to cross under a bridge...and who did I meet? My good friend Pigeon Toe... He had got a ride and went up north, he hiked this section southbound to Harper's Ferry. He was getting off trail for a couple of weeks for his daughters wedding. It was great to run into him. I sat down and we caught up for about a half an hour. The trail was good, not a lot of rockbeds and pretty smooth. The terrain was gradual ups and downs. I thought I would run into Dr G but he must have stopped at the shelter I passed by. I stopped at Gathland State Park for lunch....I ran into two hikers I hadn't met before. I was 11 miles in for the day and really didn't have a plan for the day so after checking my guide decided to go for the shelter 13 miles away. There were other places to stop if I needed to shorten it up. Water was minimal in one area and you had to walk a half mile to get it at other places so had to be strategic on where to stop. I passed by several areas with signs telling of the civil war history. My guide showed a restaurant .1 mile off trail I was looking at stopping at. I stopped and it was a fancy place so I sat for a quick break and one customer approached me and told me what the highlights I had ahead the next few miles. A couple of miles before camp I came to Washington Monument State Park. The trail actually follows the trail up and signs highlight George's life. I had to go off trail .1 miles to get to the actual monument and it over looked a beautiful valley down below. A mile later I was crossing over interstate 70/US40...felt like I wasn't that far from home . Made it to the shelter a little after seven. Quite a few campers were already there, seeing how it is now Memorial Day weekend. Set up camp...ate...and it was off to bed.","Harper's Ferry (Teahorse Hostel)

I got a good night sleep after a long day. I was surprised to see most of the campers gone by the time I got up. I was going to try to do 22 moles today. The trail started out a little rougher than it has been but nothing too bad....give it a little time and it was a pretty rough rock bed turning your feet every which way. I was making it through and I came up on a couple of guys...my foot skilled and down I went. If that wasn't bad enough...my hand went down on one side of a rock and my treking pole was across the rock causing the free end to come up and smack me in the face. It did no damage so I got up and chatted for a minute before heading on. The terrain soon improved and I was making good time. You can tell it is the holiday weekend...lots of people on the trail. I made it to the first shelter of the day...was joined by a section hiker and later a father and son. Later I went to see a cliff where you can launch hang gliders...I forgot mine . At that point I had 14 miles in and there were some couples out on there Harleys and started asking questions. They were very inquisitive. It was getting late afternoon and I still had miles to get in. About an hour later I came to a park...I was hoping to find a soda machine but struck out. I sat down for a quick break and a lady was walking by pulling her cooler. I asked if she would happen to have a soda and she said no. I filtered some water I had been carrying. The lady comes up from behind with a Pepsi and Dr Pepper and says here you go my brother had some. I offered to pay her and she refused to take my money. People are kind to us thru hikers. I left the park and a quarter mile later I came to a sign. I was leaving Maryland entering Pennsylvania. Also I was passing the Mason-Dixon line. I stopped for a picture and headed to camp. I was surprised to find just one other tent camper there. There were actually two shelters and they were both going empty. The nat's and flies have been on the increase so it will be nice to have the mesh protection during the night. I hiked in four states in the last four days. There is actually a challenge that I refused to do...some people walk the 45 miles/four states in one day. That's a lot of miles and I wasn't interested. Minus the time I was off...I have been on the trail exactly 10 weeks today. Tomorrow if all goes well I will hit the 1094 mile marker which is the halfway mark. The temps are starting to warm up but then trail is known as the green canopy...so that helps to keep it more comfortable while hiking. You just can't beat a day on the trail","Pine Knob Shelter

I didn't get the best sleep last night...too cool without the sleeping bag too hot with it...so I continued adjusting. We must have been in a popular section yesterdw because there were not nearly the amount of hikers today. We started with a 1000 ft climb...I had not noticed the elevation change until I started up it. I got to the top and there was a nice view. I seen some guys that had passed by the shelter last night and I was surprised to see them...figured they would be sleeping in because they came through kinda late. They had this little dog and I guess he scooted right up the mountain. The down was a nice gradual decline. I passed a couple of ole army guys...I didn't think they were thru hiking because nothing was dangling outside their bags. They told me they were ex army and knew how to pack. I said this is how the Air Force packs and they laughed. We got to one section and it was rocky and hard to find your way through...but after a short time we were through that. I got to the next shelter and needed water but a couple of ladies told me it was a poor water source and there was a park three miles ahead that I could get water. They also had cheeseburgers at the park so I couldn't pass that up. There were a lot of family get togethers and a good number of people enjoying the park A stream ran in the middle of it and people were out wading so I decided to join them. I put my crocks on and it was cold but felt good...it was refreshing to my tired feet. After 15 minutes of that I dried my feet off, put my shoes on and was back on the trail. I had ten miles to do and the time and miles went fast. As I was hiking I heard small engines revving... I thought I was going to pass a dirt track but some kids thought it would be a good idea to take then motorcycles on the AT.....I just stopped in my tracks and shook my head at them as they stopped. I told them they were going to get fined and got out of their way. The second one stopped and said it would be okay because he paid his taxes. I let them know the rangers were out and they continued on. It was terrible to see the tracks their tires dug into the trail. I was going to call the ranger but couldn't find a number and didn't think it was 911 worthy. Made it to camp around six. I've pounded some miles the last three days totaling close to 70. Highlights for tomorrow...1)hit the halfway point... 2)may stop by a lake and swim if the weather is warm(it may be a rainy day). 3) Take the half gallon challenge. The half gallon challenge involves eating a half gallon of icecream after you pass the trails halfway point. I'm definitely up for that. It s raining tonight...will see what tomorrow holds. I heard a tropical depression moved into the Carolina's. Another great day for a hike.","Deer Lick Shelters

I slept better last night...we did get some rain overnight but stopped NY morning. I IP and on the trail a little after eight. A little over two miles in I was halfway done with the trail..... 1994.5 miles. I missed the official sign but there was another one a little further down the trail. The trail changes every year so the halfway point moves as well. Five miles further I made it to Pine Grove Furnace State Park. This is where they have the half gallon challenge. You eat a container of ice cream to find it is only 1.5 quarts...then you have to get the other .5 qrt of ice cream. It took me about an hour but I got it down and wasn't feeling too bad. I stopped by the Appalachia Trail Museum and then thought about going to the beach for a swim. In was walking right through the middle of the park and families were on both sides having picnics. I got past them to the beach and it was packed so I pressed on. Up the trail I passed a family and the little girl says...out of the way here is a real hiker. I replied..,I thought you were a real hiker. The terrain was pretty level and not too challenging for the most part. I passed a black snake and he scurried off the trail. Later I seen a chipmunk cross the path....I put my foot down and he darted back and into it. He turned and was gone in a flash. I was feeling good for the most part but later I think the sugar high wore off and I wasnt feeling as good. Allergies were bothering my eyes and nats were buzzing my eyes and ears. I had two shelters pocked out...one at 17 and one at 25 miles. I elected to stop at 17 and call it a day. I was then first at the shelter but five more joined me later. The rain held off and it wasnt too wet after last nights rains. It was nice to have a shorter day and just hang out a little earlier. Happy Memorial Day....A day to remember all those who made the ultimate sacrifice and gave up their lives so we can enjoy our freedoms. And not only them but their families, mothers, fathers, spouses, sons, daughters and siblings who will be missing their loved ones.

Well I didn't have my tent set up the best last night...it was uneven ground and I kept sliding to one side, but I didnt sleep too bad. I didn't get as many miles in yesterday as I wanted so to make it to a shelter today I was either have to do 8 or 26 miles. So knowing me it is 26. There's a town about 13 miles in so town food is in order. Hitting these higher miles blisters have become an issue on the back of my heels. A little mole skin on them and there are manageable. I left out about eight and for the most part the terrain wasn't bad. I did hit one area early on called the rock maze. It was a little interesting climbing on and between rocks to get through. Things like that keep the hike interesting. I didn't see too many people on the trail today. One guy stopped me and we talked about a little of everything for about 10 minutes. After that I was getting close to the town of Boiling Springs and was ready to eat. Before that the trail came up on some fields and it went between a corn and wheat field. I hiked a couple of miles before I came into town. I was looking at the Pub in town..a beer would hit the spot. I walked in and the hostess was in a real nice dress...I asked if I was underdressed and she said no even though I knew I was. She told me where I could set my pack and let me sit at the bar. I got the cheese steak and a couple of cold beers and was on my way. There was very minimal elevation gain during the day and I found out more of the afternoon hike was also in fields. It was a good day for 26,miles though since they were easy miles. I did get stopped by a train though. I was coming down the trail and heard a loud motor and then seen it coming past the trees. I just set my pack down and found something to snack on. It didn't last long and I was on my way shortly after. There were a few areas the grass and weeds were tall and the trail narrow. Another place the weeds had taken over and you had to make your way through it and could just see the blazes on the tops of the posts five foot high. The last three miles were uphill. I ran into some day hikers and they gave me a package of nutter butter cookies. I hauled them to the top of the climb and stopped at a scenic view and enjoyed them. I hiked one more mile and was in camp shortly after seven. My marathon hike was over and I was ready for some food and to relax. I passed over two interstates today. The temps seemed a little cooler today and all the hiking with no tree cover wasn't too bad. I feel a shin splint trying to develop but hopefully a short day tomorrow will help so it doesn't get any worse. Even with the big mileage it was a great day to hike.

Pretty good night of sleep...whenever I was awake it did sound like something was moving around out side my tent though. I was charging my phone and I think my external battery overheats it because it shut down. I thought it crashed and I would have to reload everything again but all my stuff was still there. All that walking through the field was terrible on my allergies. Between blowing my nose....swatting gnat's and brushing cobwebs off my face I was not having a good day. And what laid ahead but another field with four foot high wheat and a narrow path to go through. By the time I got through it I was sneezing and had yellow pollen all over me. I usually don't get irritated but today I was and having a bad day hiking. I was only going eleven miles so it shouldn't have been a bad day. So I stopped said a prayer....cleaned my glasses and decided to slow down and make it the best hike possible. I started giving thanks for all the blessings in my life and my problems faded to a point. Still stumbling over rocks and even fell once, but the day was better. The miles started adding up and I was actually in town by 12;30. I ate at the Doyle which is a famous bar/hotel you walk past on the AT. It is a real old cool hotel but not the nicest one you will come across. I was thinking of going to another hotel with AC but my allergies had settled down and I decided to stay here. Still contemplating a zero day tomorrow and staying here again. I did get laundry done and the local store had someone come and pick several hikers up to go resupply at 4 pm. A bonus was Christ Lutheran Church a couple of blocks away had ""Hiker Feed"" on Wednesdays June through July, so I scored a free spaghetti dinner with salad and fruit and homemade ice cream. It was great and I hadn't been seeing a ton of hikers but we had a nice crowd there tonight. Some of the hikers I thought were long past me showed up...some how I had gotten ahead of them. Afterwards I went and sat on the balcony of the hotel. What started as a crappy day turned out to be a pretty good day.","Darlington

I slept well. Taking a shower and getting all that pollen off me I felt 100 percent better. The Doyle Hotel is an old building and doesn't have AC but I opened the window, turned on the fan and slept comfortably. I thought about taking a zero mile day but I am here to hike so I decided to press on. I went across the street to a little dinner for breakfast. It was good and pretty inexpensively. Two eggs, toast, hash browns and a couple of pancakes later, I was feeling good. The next thing on my adgenda was to send some winter stuff home...so off to the post office. I should be able to keep my pack under 30 lbs now. Verizon texted me I was close to using all my data for the month and they had a better plan for me. So I called and the lady told me I could get three times the data for $5 more a month. Then she told me the monthly charge and with the new plan I would actually be saving $20 a month.I would be saving on phone and texting on the new plan...so win for me  I planned to stop at the library and get some of the pictures on my camera uploaded onto the trail journal site but it wasn't where it said it was on my map so I started hiking. Later another hiker told me it was actually in a church and it was only opened a few hours a day. Just after leaving town, I passed over two bridges/rivers, the long bridge passed over the Susquehanna River. Then into the woods where there was a climb to reach a ridgeline I would be walking. What a difference a day makes....the hike was very enjoyable. I wasn't pushing too hard, my allergies were not bothering me and I think it was cooler and I wasn't sweating so much and the gnats were leaving me alone. This part of the trail is known to be rocky but they didn't seem to be too bad.I stopped at the first shelter of the day for a quick break and water. Six other hikers came and went while I was there. The next certain water source was 13 miles away with a unreliable one seven miles away at the next shelter. So I took an extra liter of water with me. I made good time and was there by 4:30. It was a 16 person and no places for tent camping. We ended up with about 12 hikers. I put my feet up for about 15 minutes and my allergies started bothering me. I think some pollen got on my sleeping mat the day before. I took it out and shook it off and it seemed to help. The forecast was for possible thunderstorms so inside wasn't a bad idea. I ate dinner and hung out with the other hikers until 8:30....bedtime. Tomorrow looks to be an 18 mile day. It was a great day to be on the trail","Duncannon (Doyle Hotel)

It rained overnight and forecast called for more the next couple of days. The trail wasn't too muddy but the rocks were slick. Pennsylvania is known for rocks on the upper part of the state and we are starting to see them but not consistently yet. My eyes are bothering me a little other than that my allergies are staying in check. As I started to hike the weather was foggy...I like the fog...the greens pop and there is just a mystic feel about it. The next shelter is 18.5 miles so I won't be stopping at a shelter for lunch. Towards the end of morning the rain starts...it is not a heavy rain so it feels good and I'm not getting soaked. The good thing is it cools you down and it keeps the gnats from buzzing your eyes and ears. I stop for lunch a little after eleven and was going to get water from the spring. The water is pretty orange coming out of the spring so I decide to get it later. I hike past a sign that says there are remains of a coal mining town. I think about checking it out but it is .7 miles so that would add 1.5 miles to my day so I pass it by. A little way down the trail I see a sign for "" The General"" it is also .7 off the trail. I'm not sure what it is so I continuous on. When I get to camp there is a Ridge Runner, I ask him about the two places and he said the first place was a lot of foundations from old coal mine town and ""The General"" was an old locomotive. I kinda wish I would have went and checked out the locomotive. There is a chance of rain tonight but I decide to go ahead and tent camp.

Well we didn't get the rain they were calling for last night so I got to pack up a dry tent . Looking at 17.5 miles today and water is sporadic so I will have to keep an eye on it. I hiked a couple of miles and ran into a couple of guys i met at the last town(Hoosier and Forster). I asked if they had any trail magic for me and thay had actually come across some Little Debbie cakes and granola bars. I grabbed a granola bar and spoke with them a short while. I moved on and came up on a section hiker. He had been hiking sections of the trail for 17 years and has made it this far from Georgia. He was a retired school teacher. We were heading up hill and he tried to keep up but he was out of breath quickly and stopped to catch it. I turned to ask of he was okay and he said he just need a breather so I continued on. I passed a girl that stayed at the shelter I did last night. This is the most people I had seen in the trail in a while. I was feeling pretty good but wasnt moving that extremely fast. The terrain was getting a little more rocky...at one point one of those rocks decided to jump up and I stubed my toe pretty well. There is a military installation on the east side of the trail. I'm not sure what all they have going on there. I hear some pretty heavy gun fire...in the past few days I've seen an array of aircraft to include C-130(what I worked on in the AF), biplanes, and another older aircraft. The gun fire goes on throughout the day. I end up getting to the shelter a little after 3:00. It is a nice one...fully enclosed, porta pot, solar shower, and the bonus... The pizza place delivers here. After four others arrived it started raining. I took it upon myself to organize the pizza order. I called it in, collected the money and went out to the road to wait on it. When I got to the road a car bad just backed up to leave and I noticed they left their shoes outside the door of where they were parked. I tried to wave them down but they sped off to get ahead of traffic. Guess they figure it out when they get home. Tomorrows forecast is for heavy storms so we will see what happens. Allergies were not an issue and I'm feeling well...other than the stubbed toe. The gnats even stayed away for the most part. Oh yeah....I went over the 1189.2 mile mark today...this means I have less than 1000 miles to go","Rausch Gap Shelter

Well the 501 shelter is nice. It was a four walled shelter with doors and bunks for 12. It had a large sun roof so it didn't need electricity. It was close to the road...I think that's why it had a care taker to keep an eye on the place. Towards the end of evening he came in and said we were supposed to have severe weather the following day and we spend a second night there. I guess the rule is you are only suppose to spend one night there. I really didn't want to zero there and wanted to hike. Checking the forecast it called for rain and thunderstorms during the morning and afternoon and the severe stuff was supposed to be late afternoon. As long as the trail wasn't all big rocks it shouldn't be that bad of day to hike. Forester and Hoosier thought the same only they were going to do nine miles and have a hostel owner pick them up. I still planned non 15 miles to get to the shelter and if I was making poor time I would elect to go to the hostel too. I was on the trail by 7:45 and it was raining a little but not bad. The thing about being in the forest is you don't feel the rain...you only get wet when the wind blows the trees and the water shoes down on you. The trail started rocky but leveled off. I had an objective and made good time. I was at the road to the hostel by 11:00 and earlier decided I would press on as long as I was there by noon. I passed a marker for an old lookout during the French/Indian war. The trail turned off and as I turned I came across some trail magic. It was a cooler with some healthy snacks in it. I grabbed a yogurt drink and a bag with seeds and nuts. It was great because I didn't plan to stop for lunch but just snack in the way. I passed a couple of guys going the other way..the one guy said the hostel I thought about going to was very nice. I was tempted to go but pressed on. As I came to the road of the hostel pick up it was pretty foggy. It was four lane and the cars were zooming by pretty fast. After a couple went by I headed to the center were there was a small median. I didn't get there too soon before a care without its lights caught me by surprise. I made it in plenty of time...just didn't plan to count on the median for safety. The next six miles were a lot like the first nine. I made good time and was at the shelter at 1:15...well before the 2:00 o'clock I was hoping to be there by. The shelter was .3 miles off trail and a spring was a little over halfway in. I got picked up water at the spring and went to the shelter to eat. I filtered/filled my water bottles and went back to the spring to get more water....wash my legs...wash my socks out. I guess the weather forecast scared everyone else off because I was the only one there. I had internet so I loaded some journal entries and finished preparing for the storm. They were calling for strong winds, lightening, hail, heavy rains. This shelter was built out of logs and seemed a great place to hunker down for a storm. I packed everything back into my backpack in case the winds were crazy and even locked the waists belt around the shelter beam. Well the storm came and went and it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Maybe there is more to come. Another hiker came in so there will be two of us tonight.","501 Shelter

Well no more storms came through during the night. It was nice to see the guy that showed up after the storm. It's funny on the trial...you feel more at ease with a stranger in camp...lol. He started in Harpers Ferry and is headed to Maine...then he will go back to Harpers Ferry and head south to complete his thru hike(flip flopper). The way the shelter was built it was pretty dark...woke up a little after seven and wasn't that light but turned to the open side and it was a beautiful morning. Sun was out and plenty of blue skies. Not that we see much of that because we are hiking the AT (green canopy). So today's agenda was to get into Hamburg and go to Cabellas. I had nine miles to get to Port Clinton and Hamburg was a couple of miles south of that. I needed new shoes, a new waterproof food bag, Tips for the bottom of my trekking poles and a few other things. No luck on trekking pole parts. They didn't have the shoes I wanted but did get the food bag. This is the worlds largest Cabelas but they deal more with the hunters and fishermen. I had been here a few years back going to a running event. They have all sorts of wild animals (that have been to the taxidermy of course). I went to Walmart to do a food resupply and decided I'd go back to Cabelas and try the shoes they did stock. I really liked my shoes they were Socouny trail runners and I have put 950 miles on them on the trail. The bottoms held up good but the top of the shoes were shot. I will say Cabelas customer service was not very impressive... I've been to there smaller stores and have had much better service. I tried three pairs and decided on a Merrill shoe. So good bye old friends that have got me so far and hello new blisters that are sure to set in. So after that I got some dinner at Long John Silvers. I asked for hushpuppies for a side not realizing it came with hushpuppies so I had a plate of fish and chicken coleslaw and eight hush puppies. It was getting close to 6 pm and I had over five miles to go after I got to the trail. I headed towards the trail and seen a guy getting in a pickup truck...I asked if he could give me a ride to the trail head...he said he doesn't do that sort of thing, so I wish him a great day and started up the road. Not long after a couple pulled over and asked if I needed a ride and I was back to the trail in no time. Got to love the trail angels I got to try out my new shoes quick...straight up and the down and up again. So far my feet feel good, we will see if its the same tomorrow. It was a beautiful day with temps in the low 70s. I probably got a good 20 miles in today but only 14 counted  It was a wonderful day to be a hiker","Eagles Nest Shelter

No rain last night and the plan is to get to the next shelter before the rain hits today. The temperatures are only supposed to be in the low 60s so it will be a cool rain. Got on the trail at 7:30, Secret Agent and Stitch are not far behind. Those two are constantly together and constantly talking. They move extremely fast for as much as they talk. Yesterday I passed them today they passed me. We are finally hitting some of those rocks that Pennsylvania is so famous for. They are not crazy bad but you have to be careful or you will be on your butt real quick. The rain comes a little sooner than expected and thunder is in the distance. I have to pass an area called knifes edge. It is just a pile of rocks you have to climb on, over, between while looking for the next blaze to move forward. Rocks are fun...wet rocks are real fun. I make it through and the rain starts coming down harder and lightening is getting close. I have another rock pile(Bear Rocks) about a half mile ahead and the shelter is a couple of miles ahead. As the weather conditions deteriorate I notice an area to the side where people have camped. I decide to go there and set up the tent and wait out the storm. Hopefully the ground will allow me to put my tent stakes in. Usually I put a ground cloth down and then the tent but no time to mess with that. I get my tent up but the area is kinda small so I have to do some adjusting to get it to work. I get my gear and myself in and life is better. I never eat in my tent but I make the exception and dig out my big bag of trail mix. I'm laying on a couple of big rocks but get my sleeping pad laid out and its no biggie. The wind is blowing in the foot end of my tent but I push my backpack against it and it works fine. I dig out my rain jacket to help me keep warm. I don't wear my rain gear when I hike because it just makes you sweat. After about 30 minutes I'm getting cold. So I dig through my bag get a long sleeve shirt. I take my wet clothes off and put the long sleeve shirt and rain gear back on. The rain slows down but the wind is howling pretty good. I wait for the rain to stop and go check things out. Its still windy but the storm is gone. So a little after an hour in the tent....I pack up and get back to hiking. The Bears Rocks are about as challenging as the Knifes Edge but the wind has helped to dry them off. I get through them and on to the shelter before 2:00. I eat a quick lunch and back on the trail. I an to get to town(Palmerton). I am due for a shower and clean clothes. On my way I see a big black snake out sunning himself. I try to get a pic but by the time I get my camera out of the plastic bag....he is moving off trail. I get to town. One of the restaurant owners let's hikers stay in a garage behind his busines. So I stay there and he has a shower and the laundromat is right next door. I get my shower, and eat dinner while I'm waiting on my laundry. Later I go get a couple cold beers and on the way back to the garage I stop by the grocery for a box of backery cookies. I'm worn out and it was a great day on the trail","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

Sleeping in the garage was fine. Supposedly some loud alarm went off outside but I was just told about it today...lol. I was thinking of zeroing today but the forecast is sunny with a high of 70 so I decided to hike today and zero Saturday when they are calling for rain and T-storms. L ate breakfast at the place I was staying at and two other hikers(grizzly and moma?) were eating and lining up a ride with the owner to the trail. I had nothing packed and told them to go ahead without me. I started packing and they hadn't left so I got my stuff together fast and got a ride with them. Its amazing I didn't loose anything because I just started throwing things wherever and didn't even have my shoes on when we left. She dropped us off at a local business and I put everything in its home and had everything. The ride saved me two miles getting back to the trail. So I've been waiting for these Pennsylvania rocks I've heard so much about and the wait is over. The day started with the most technical climb we've had so far but we will get more further north. Huge rocks going straight up with small foot holds and a backpack pulling you backwards. It took close to an hour to get to the top of this mountain and the view was spectacular. I don't know what I would have done if I was a day earlier and that rain hit....there was nowhere to hide. The wind was kicking and Stitch lost her hat but we were able to locate it. I got a few good pictures then moved on. There is a detour on the AT because it passes through a super fund site where they smelted zinc from 1898 to 1980. The detour was quite scenic as we were out of the treeline walking a open ridge looking down on the village below and the mountains to the west. So after the detour the trail is back into the trees and just a continuous path of small rocks. And like they say they all have points that stick up. You have to watch where you put your foot down every step. Sometimes you are stepping on rocks and sometimes between them. It is a pretty tough hike, you're not doing much but watching where to put your next foot. Not making many fast miles today. I passed a couple of guys doing some surveying and they are complaining about the rocks too. After a long day and only a little over 15 miles I make it to camp by five. I get my tent set up....it needs to dry from yesterdays storm. I go get water and the closest spring is dried up. I end up walking .6 miles for water and that adds another 1.2 miles to my day. Not much water in this part of PA...there was only one other water source during the day and it was a ways off trail too. I got settled in and hope to get 20 miles in tomorrow but that may change. It was a beautiful day for a hike.","Palmerston PA (Bert Steakhouse Garage)

Yesterday must have been a rough day because I slept good. The temperature dropped into the upper 40s and it was good sleeping weather. I was up early though and was on the trail by 7:30. My feet hurt and feel tired but feel better after you get going a while. More rocks today and my new shoes are taking a beating. The trail started rough again but I was refreshed and feeling good. I know the trail is rough because it was a perfect day to hike and I see no day hikers or weekend hikers. As it was yesterday a lot of the trail has small rocks that point up. You can dodge some of them but end up on another one. I hit a couple of boulder areas and ensure I tap my treking poles on the rocks to warn any sunning snakes. I did see one snake under a rock but I didnt get close enough for him to rattle at me. One boulder area was at a cliff...not the greatest view but it was a sharp drop down. I made it halfway just a little after 11:00 and stopped for lunch. I pulled out my sleeping mat and even took my shoes off to air my feet out. I did another seven miles and stopped at the shelter for water. This was the only water supply of the day. The plan was to do another 6.5 miles and stay at a church hostel in Delaware Water Gap community. During the afternoon sections of the trail smoothed out and I wasn't dodging rocks like I was earlier in the day. I made it to town by 4:00 an hour earlier than I had planned. I went out for a calzone and beer and back to relax. I plan to zero tomorrow and be refreshed for Sunday. Today was a perfect day for a hike...low 70s, sunny skies and no bugs.","Leroy Smith Shelter

It was nice to take a zero. Between the two days I seen a lot new and old faces. I ate a lot, did my laundry, resupplied and just gave my body some rest. I started the day off with a hiker breakfast that included two eggs, toast, bacon, hash browns and two pancakes. One girl, Ranger, hiked this area as a kid, fifteen years ago, wanted to go to Hotgog Johnies where they would go after hiking. Kinder had a car and I went along. This place was in Butzville New Jersey and it was amazing how many people were there. They had four windows to order food and there was a line behind each. The cook the hotdogs in peanut oil. I got two dogs, a fries and birch beer(kinda like rootbeer). They had been selling hotdogs here for like seventy years. It was really good. Later Ken, an older member of the church gave us a ride to the next town so we could hit Walmart...it was quite the ride. On the way back he dropped us off at a bakery that bad a hotdog and piece of pie special for $2.95. Since I already had a hotdog they were smoking pork and sausage out front. I elected to get the pulled pork with two small sides. It was late in the day and they hooked me up with a large side of potato salad and a large piece of watermelon. Later they were cleaning up an brought our table over some left over pulled pork. We ate that and then I couldn't leave with out some apple pie and ice cream. This hiker hunger is enjoyable and the best thing is no need to worry about gaining weight. People that stayed at the church hostel included, Pops, Pine Cone, Ranger, Griz, Moma Bear, Kinder, Toxic Feet, Robin, Subman and Suds, Secret Agent, Stitch.","Delaware Water Gap (Church of Mt)

I got my stuff ready the night before so I would make minimum noise in the morning since I was leaving early. Most people were up before me though. The kid that showed up a week earlier at the shelter when there was tstorms got in late last night (Romontee?) So I talked with him, I had heard he was having knee problems but he seemed to be doing okay now. Subman and Suds was heading out at seven and I was fifteen minutes behind them. We had to hike an little through town and then we were out along interstate 80. They had concrete barrier and a place for us to walk as we passed over the Delaware River. It was a pretty long bridge and right in the middle we passed over into New Jersey. We passed a state park visitor center and then crossed underneath the interstate and eventually got back to the dirt/rock trail. The rocks weren't too bad starting off but they got bad for a while and then improved as the day went on. We passed by sunfish pond and it made by a glacier and had very acidic water that only few fish species could survive and one was the sunfish. As I was walking beside it two snakes out sunning were on the trail.. I seen the first and he moved off. The second caught me by surprise. I was in a shaded area and he was in one small sunny spot. He slithered off....just caught me off guard. I always hit my poles on the rocks when I feel I'm in snake territory. We had a couple of areas we were climbing on boulders but they didn't last long and the change of pace was nice. We passed one camping area that had a spectacular view but it was too early in the day to stop. I stopped at a fire tower for lunch. You could climb the tower but the observation deck was locked. It was extremely windy the higher up you went. I threw my sleeping pad out below the tower in the shade...took my shoes off...and enjoyed my lunch. Subman and Suds came by and I hiked with them a little after lunch. I was trying to get more miles in so I pushed ahead of them. Late in the afternoon as I hiked a bear went running across the trail about 25 yards in front of me. That caught me off guard because I hadn't seen a bear since Virginia. I was going to stop at a campsite but the water looked nasty so I pushed on four miles to the shelter. I found Moma Bear, Pops and a couple of other hikers at the shelter. I said I'll just set up my tent. They said one guy had his tent up and a bear came over and started sniffing it. So we all decided to all stay in the shelter. We ended up with nine hikers in a five person shelter. It has a big porch and we are sleeping on it also. Not suppose to rain so should be okay. The weather was low 70s and the wind kept you from sweating. Hiking doesn't get much better than this","Delaware Water Gap (Church of Mt)

There were no bear issues during the night. It was a cool night...good for sleeping. When I got up my feet hurt...all these rocks have taken their toll. The bottom of my feet have been feeling sore but today's the worst I recall. It is a tired or even a bruised feeling but get moving and they loosen up. It just seemed today we started on a rocky trail again. Today's agenda included a beach and concession stand in the afternoon. The morning was cool...I had to start hiking to warm up. Water was limited again so I needed to stop at the shelter six miles away and fill up. By the time I was done getting water and filtering it I was cold again. I believe the temps were in the upper 50s and threre was a cool breeze. I hiked another four miles and found a shelter on top of a mountain with limited views I stopped for lunch. The sun was out and it wasn't so cool when you were out of the wind. On my way off of the mountain I spotted a wild turkey and five young turkeys. I tried to get a picture and got one of the mother. I hiked a little further and couldn't find a white blaze. So I turned around and got back to the trail. Those little turkeys threw me off. I made it to the lake and went to the concession stand to find it was closed on Mondays  The sun was no lknger out and it was a cool day. Only a dozen people were on the beech. I took my shoes off and waded a bit and then took a shower to get one layer of dirt off. I put the same clothes back on but felt a little cleaner. I passed the highest point in New Jersey and took a picture of the monument that sets on top. I made it to the shelter and everyone is tenting or hammocking. So hopefully the bears will leave us alone. We always joke the people in the hammocks look like a burrito to a bear. Today was NOT a good day to...

I woke up early and was on the trail before seven. The trail was the best it had been in a long time. Not much elevation change and more importantly the rocks were gone to start the day. I was heading to Unionville to get a few things for my food bag at the local grocery. It wasnt much of a grocery but a convience store. They did have breakfast sandwiches and I got a ham, egg and cheese sandwich and OJ, the sandwich was exceptionally. Before heading out I got a throwback Mountain Dew with real sugar and that also hit the spot. I headed out of town and the trail remained good to me. After some time I came to some fields but they hay had already been cut and rolled and it was nice being out in the sun as the day had started out cool. There were lots of boardwalks throughout the day, one was over a half mile long. Its been dry for a while so not much water was under them though. I passed into New York and was back and forth between that and New Jersey all day. I had a late lunch and was heading for what the locals call ""stairway to heaven"". It was a pretty good climb up. Lots of people were here and on the boardwalks. A few passed me but had to stop before they made it to the top...I just kept a steady pace and passed them on the way up. The overlook was of both NY and NJ. I found the tower I was at just a day earlier and it was amazing to see how far I had come(22 miles to this point). Soon one of the couples I had passed come running up and said there were three cubs and a moma bear at the overlook entrance. One guy went down and scared them away and I never did see them. I headed to the shelter and picked up some water on the way up. This is one of the few shelters that doesn't have a close water source. I ate with six hikers I had never met before and headed to the tent because the mosquitoes were bad. I checked out tomorrows shelters and it will be a tough call. There is one at 12 miles and one at 26. There is not much as in campsites in between and one area is suppose to be kinda technical. I guess I will see how bad it is and go from there. It really felt good to get away from those rocks even though I had some during the day. It was the best hiking day I have had in a while.

Got a good nights sleep and up and on the trail at 6:45. Looking at over 26 today and some of the terrain is challenging. A couple miles in I hear something and it is a large bobcat. He is a ways off and poses while I take a few pictures. I start hiking and he runs off. I'm sure glad I got my tent to keep me safe at night There is a note in my guide book that states although the elevation looks realitivly flat, there are some technical areas. So I don't know if it means a certain area or 25 miles. Not far into the day the boulder climbs start..the first one is a pretty good one. Then the trail is easier but not long after I am climbing on boulders again. I get to the highest point the AT goes in New York and looking around I believe I can barely see the NY city skyline. The trial goes small ups and downs all day. Some of the trail is very good walking trail...there are some rocky areas and then the boulder areas. The dry weather is starting to show. I got to one of the falls today that was suppose to be a good water source and there wasn't all that much water coming down. Other places the water was pretty stagnant. Several place people put jugs of water out for us. I got off trail at one place and a guy on a four wheeler was coming down the trail. I said you're not supposed to be on here and politely he told me I missed a fork in the trail. I went back and even knowing...the trail was kind of hard to find. I passed several small lakes/ponds. I did get trail magic a couple of times today. Both had gallon jugs of water, but one had chairs, bananas, peaches, nutty Buddy's and even a candle to keep the bugs away. The bugs are getting bad. Gnats buzzing you all day, flies around you and the last couple of days the mosquitos. I used my off for the first time when I got to the shelter. I found my first tic on me today and I caught it early on my shin and he came right off. Late in the day I came to ""The Lemon Squeeze"". It is a narrow pathway that gets narrower as it goes. I passed through some rocks that surrounded me and I though no problem..but then there is another part that I had to take my pack off....take my trekking poles over first...go back for my pack and hold it sideways. Then when I got of the tight spot I had to lift it over my head and set it on a rock above the narrow crevice. I made it through there and then had to climb a tall boulder. I think this was the most difficult thing I've had to climb. It wasn't long just a tough rocks to get on top of with not much foot or hand holds. There was an alternative route that was easier but that's no fun. It was a long day as I didn't get to camp until about 8:00. So over 13 hours on the trail today. I'm tired but don't feel bad. The temps are warming into the low 80s but that's not bad in the shade most of the day. The only thing I know now is I get to go hiking tomorrow","Wawayanda Shelter

Had my first night sleeping with no one else at the shelter campsite...so I thought. I woke up and someone came in and tented too. I didn't go to bed til after 9:00 so they got in late(after dark). It was dry all night and rained just long enough to get my tent wet and the rocks wet and slick. My first goal was to make it five milesnto water. There was no water at the shelter and the water source prior had stagnant water. Lucky someone left jugs close to the road yesterday so I wasn't completely out. Got to the stream and it was flowing good and the water looked good. Since I have been up north some of the water is brown even after filtering it. I made it to a four lane highway and I could have hiked .4 miles for a coke but decided against it and eat at a restaurant this evening. I bad a good climb and was suppose to have a view of NY city skyline but it was too hazy to see it. I was only like 36 miles from the city. Its crazy to think how much more different NY city and the AT are but so close together. Later in the afternoon I climbed Bear Mountain where Perkins Memorial Tower stood. By the time I arrived it was raining and again the NY skyline was unable to be seen. So after that I went down the mountain and into Fort Montgomery right off the Hudson River. Before you get there you have to go through a museum/zoo. The AT goes right through the zoo and you get in free. I didn't venture off the trail but did see a bobcat and the bears. I left there and went off the AT trail and went down a trail that gave some history and the importance of the Fort during the Revolutionary War. There was a museum and further down the trail and cannons were still sitting aimed at the Hudson River as they were at that time in history. I stopped by a restaurant and had a pizza burger fries and a couple of cold beers. Toped it off with a brownie Sunday. I then hiked my two miles back to the AT and had to cross Bear Mountain Bridge. This is what took me over the Hudson River. Busy road but they had a walkway on the side to keep us safe. I made to the campsite I planned to stay and met another hiker there I had seen earlier in the day. The temperatures are warming a little more every day but the rain made it comfortable.

I woke up this morning to some loud snorting. I looked out my tent and found a large deer that was far away making the noise. He soon moved on. It was just after 6:00 so I started getting things gathered and packed up. I chatted with the guy who camped with me and was on the trail a little after 7:00. Three miles down the way I stopped at a store, Appalachian Grocery, for resupply and breakfast. The miles seemed to go slow today and but I kept pressing on. I came up on one guy and he said he found the end of the trail...I laughed and said it was time to get rid of my trekking poles. The trail was not well marked but we found the trail. There were three places I could camp but since the miles weren't coming very fast, I thought about stopping at the first one which was a state park, thru hikers could camp one night for free. During the 30s the CCC did work in the parks. They built stone walls in several areas that still stand today. At one area there was a stone wall about 12 ft high we were walking on with drop offs on both sides. It was pretty cool. When people make the statement its good enough for government work they need to see what these workers did 80 years ago and still stands solid today. Thanks to them i had a flat level trail and I'm sure it served a purpose for water run off as well. So I actually got to the state park by 3:00 and decided to head to the 23 mile shelter which was the farthest. I made it to the shelter by 6:00 so I did better than I thought. I don't know if its the terrain, nutrition, the continuous pounding on the body or what but my energy level doesn't seem as high as it once was. I'm still hiking faster than a lot of folks so maybe its a combination of all the things. I have been hitting a lot of big miles too, so that may be part of it. I got to the shelter and saw a lot of new faces. This is one of the busiest shelters I've been at. They deliver pizza here may be the reason why. I elected to eat my delicious Ramon noodles though. Even though the miles were slow...it was a great day for a hike","Hemlock Springs Campsite

I had one of those moments when you wake up and thought ""where am,I at?"". I wasn't sure which shelter I was at until I looked outside. Moose is a 16 year old kid out here hiking the trail. I seen his mom waiting at a parking area yesterday. Today the shelter was close to the road and she dropped off muffins, OJ and milk for us hikers. A nice way to start the day. Since I had a long day yesterday, I was in no hurry to get going. I was one of the last ones out, on the trail at 8:30. I didn't push it today just hiked a little slower pace. The terrain was kind today and after five miles I got to a road that led to a deli. I went and got a chicken club sandwich, a Mt Dew, chips and a bag of M&Ms.. They didn't have a place to sit inside so I went to the bench out front and then decided to check out the back. They had a big yard with the lawn cut recently and a picnic table shaded by some trees. It was a perfect day without a cloud in the sky to enjoy my lunch. I took my time and ate and charged up my electronics. In was there about an hour and a half and just enjoyed the day. I had less than 12 miles left to the shelter and had a great day of hiking. I stopped by one shelter about halfway to where I was going and relaxed and talked to Fliker a hiker who was at the shelter last night. Later I stopped and was filtering water when (will insert name later)..came up. I thought he was ahead of me. I found out he actually started hiking last summer and hiked through the fall. He went back to college this spring and then came back to the trail when classes were over. He started at the NY/ Connecticut boarder and went north to Katahdin Maine last summer. Hit the southern part of the trail last fall and will complete it back at the NY/Connecticut boarder tomorrow. That is sooo cool. He is a fast hiker and will get there before me but is from the area and his friends and family will be there to celebrate his accomplishment. He is the same kid that the bear was sniffing his tent a few days earlier. I continued hiking went around a nice little lake and had a little bit of a climb before the shelter. At the top was a nice scenic view so I stopped and just took it in for a while. I made to to the shelter around 5:30 and just enjoyed the evening with the four other hikers in for the night. The gnats were very annoying towards the end of the day, but it was a beautiful day for a hike","RPH Shelter

I was up and out of camp at 7:15. Cheddar was finishing his thru hike today and promised there would be trail magic were he finished in 14 miles. Bevo is a hiker I met the first day I returned from my leg injury in May. I was doing short miles then and he got ahead of me. I ran into him again two days ago and he had some friends come and hike with him for a few days. His friends were heading home today and the other people he had been hiking with are a few days behind. He was hiking with his friends to the next road and then he was going to hike with me. Well I was behind them and missed seeing/pics of the biggest tree on the AT. I had a pic about a month or so ago but it was the largest one in the southern half, this one was slightly larger. So before the other hikers got to the road I caught up with them. We get to the train tracks and there is a bench on a platform. Nothing else...my guide said Rail Road Station but I was expecting something a little more elaborate. I guess you sit there and the train will stop. Bevos friends were on a tight schedule and didn't get picked up here but found a ride to a different station so they could get to the airport on time for their flights. Just down from.there at the road crossing there was a landscape garden center that we could get water and they had an outdoor shower. So I filled up water bottles and rinsed some of the dirt off of me before hiking on. The trail was pretty smooth and Bevo and I made good time. We came across some trail magic of sodas and snacks. We stopped and had one of each. We had just entered Connecticut and this was a nice welcome. The next stop was where Cheddar was finishing his hike. We got to the place we thought Cheddar would be but no one was there...so we walked down then road to an old bridge and once again no Cheddar. Well I guess we missed it. We were going to get back on the trail and eat what we had packed...how disappointing. The trail went down another road and as we were heading down it we see a group of people and one yells out...""How about a cheeseburger?"". We had found the party. We congratulated Cheddar and envied him a bit. They had a good spread, hamburgers, fruit, taco casserole with chips, soda, beer, snacks we could take along and brownies. We ate well. A ridge runner walked by and they fed him also. They had a cool sign made and on the side of the van congratulating Cheddar. It had picture of him starting the hike last year and it was amazing how much older he looked today. After about an hour and a half Bevo and I headed on. We had a couple nice up hills and stopped at one overlook for a break. We decided we would stay at a hostel tomorrow night but you needed reservations because it included dinner and breakfast. We called and they were booked up. That's the first time I have been turned down by a hostel. So we figured alternative shelters that would give us a chance to resupply on food. The first half of the day we had good mileage in short time...this afternoon the miles were coming a.little tougher but we only had six to do. We made it to the shelter by 5:30 and found a couple of hikers already there. One was Buba...he was from Quebec. He was section hiking and asking about my tent and Bevos hammock. A couple of other guys came in including Flash 52. He has a trail journal and wrote about my ole partner Marathon and his horrible shin splints. I told him I heard from Marathon last Sunday and he was already through the White Mountains. Flash was surprised he was that far with the way he had last seen him. Today was a 21 miler but it seem to have went pretty quick. It was sunny and the temperatures are warming up...I'd guess mid to upper 80s. And as you know.... it was a beautiful day for a hike 
Oh, and one other note. I am getting off the trail in a few days for a little over a week. Grandbaby Abigail is coming up from Texas to meet my Ohio brother and sisters family's. I have to go see that sweet little girl and introduce her.","Telephone Pioneers Shelter

I got a good nights sleep and was up and on the trail by 7:15. I hiked with Bevo again today, he had a group he was hiking with but they took some time off and are a couple of days behind. Planned to do 17 miles today and the terrain had some ups and downs but for the most part not too bad. We hiked a couple of hours and came down to a gravel road along a river we followed. After about a mile down the road we seen a pick-up truck with its tail gate down and a water jug on the back. Could it be trail magic? Bevo said ""just some campers"", I think just so we wouldn't be let down. But sure enough it was trail magic. They had peanut butter and jelly to make sandwiches, garanola bars, bananas, apples, watermelon, cookies and leftover anniversary cake. I believe they said they had been married 34 years. Never expected to find a spread like that on a Monday. He worked for UPS and didn't have to work last night so they drove an hour and fifteen minutes just for this kind act. We were they first hikers they had seen and soon three others joined us to include Buba. The rest of the morning was pretty easy hiking. Since we got to Connecticut, water has seemed to be more readily available. We did have one nice climb in the morning and it ended at a campsite. It was the nicest campsite I have seen. It had three picnic tables, an overhang, a bench swing, and a privy (outhouse). We ate a quick snack and pressed on. We kept leap frogging the other hikers that were at the trail magic with us. It was a very warm day so breaks were a little more frequent and I drank a lot more water than usual. I passed and talked to a couple from Indiana. They come out a couple weeks every year for the last eight years. They started at Springer Mt Georgia and have made it this far. I passed another lady who was struggling with the heat and stopped early so she could camp. The afternoon brought a bunch of ups and downs and with the heat made them a little more challenging. About 3:00 pm, the hostel we tried to reserve yesterday, let Bevo know they had two cancellations and we could stay. We had already planned out the next few days and were no longer interested. We went through another set of boulders that was like the lemon squeezer a couple of days ago. It was not as tight but we got some good pictures since there were two of us. We got to the next shelter just after 4:00. We decided to press on to the next campsite 2.5 miles down the trail. So our day turned out to be 19.7 miles in the heat but overall not a bad day. As a matter of fact...it was beautiful day for a hike.
Funny story I left out yesterday. A hiker at the last shelter asked me who I was going to vote for. My reply "" The person least likely to be reelected in four years."". His response ""That's a new perspective I haven't heard before""...and we had a good laugh.","Algo Shelter

We got a little rain last night but not too much. Bevo and I were up and on the trail a little after 7:00. Today was a good day because we were going through town which means town food . We planned to hike seventeen miles today. A cool front had come through and the temperatures had cooled down but first thing in the morning it seemed a little humid. The humidity seemed to go away though. We went over the Housatonic River and stopped at a high school for some water. As we continued we passed a big waterfall. We took some pictures and started a 1000 ft climb. It was a gradual climb with a smooth trail so it wasn't too bad. After we got up the mountain we were hiking and everything was perfect...temperature was good the birds were singing and we felt good. I said something about zippity doo dah and Bevo started singing it. I think a squirrel even ran towards us instead of away from us. It was just a period of time everything just seemed perfect...even the gnats were leaving us alone. The rest of the morning was downhill. On section went straight down but there were rock steps to make it a little easier. My pack started to bother my shoulder and I tighter my waste belt to take some of the load off my shoulders. It finally happened...I ran out of belt adjustment it was as tight as it would go. At one point we were hiking down a hill and came across a guy carrying a street bicycle on his shoulder. It was kind of rocky so there is no way he could have been riding it on the trail. He went on to tell us is was riding from Portland Maine to Portland Washington and wanted to spend a night in the shelter on the AT. You never know what you are going to run into here. We got to town and went to the White Hart Inn and Tap Room. It was pretty fancy and we asked if stinky hikers were welcome and they said come on in. I got a bacon cheeseburger fries and a beer. The burger was one of the thickest I've ever had. It was delicious. Bevo was wanting a shake but ice cream was the best they could do. I had the ice cream with the rhubarb strawberry crumble. Very tasty but they were skimpy with the ice cream. We hung out a while and charged our phones and looked at the trail ahead and some of the more challenging areas. We headed out of town and there it was....trail magic . A lady and her son, who had hiked the AT, had Gatorade, brownies, and candy bars. I had a Gatorade and a brownie and she packed up a brownie and a couple of candy bars for me to pack out. While we were there another hiker, T, came up and had some magic too. We chatted a while and then headed to the shelter five miles away. We came to on nice overlook on the way to the shelter. We got to camp by five and had a nice evening even though the gnats were a little annoying by this time. The day went fast and I am looking forward to tomorrow. I hate to leave the trail but my sisters are coming to pick me up so I can go visit grand baby Abigail . She is seven months old and I can't wait to see her and the rest of my family(daughter, son in law, brother and sisters families). It is hard to leave the trail but I'm excited to see everyone also. I think this is longest I've gone without a shower and getting my clothes washed...11 days. I was pushing miles...225 miles in the last 11 days. My sisters will get the full effect of my stickiness when they pick me up to get off the trail . I even amazed myself today when I felt my shorts and realized just how starchy they were from the sweat over the last week. You couldn't ask for a better weather day than today...it was an incredibly wonderful day to be a hiker","Sharon Mountain Campaite

I had a good nights sleep. I don't know if it is just me but it doesn't seem like I have been hearing any animals snooping around at night the last couple of nights. I was up and on the trail by 6:45, hiking with Bevo again. My pack was light as I have very little food and getting low on other supplies too. We bad a couple of good climbs this morning and then we would coast into town this afternoon. The climbs weren't too steep of grade going up but coming down the other side was a little steeper. At one point the trail was on the cliffs and it was a awesome panoramic view on our right side. I love when the trail is like that. At one view we stopped and had lunch. I called my sister and coordinated our meeting place and changed it because of road construction where we planned to meet and they(two sisters) had a little trail magic they wanted to drop off. I pushed an extra mile to make it a 17 mile day and found a place that had a parking lot for them to stop. Bevo and I got there a little before 3:00 and had some refreshing drinks and snacks. Bevo was going to a hostel tonight and got picked up at this same location. T, another hiker, made it for some refreshments too. We took a few pics and said our good byes. I am going off trail until the July 3rd for some family time. We put the cooler with drinks and snacks out for other hikers coming through later. As we headed to the hotel we picked up some hikers that were hitching out of town and took them back to the trail. I'd say that's the first time my sister has ever picked up a hitch hiker We went to the hotel so I could shower and then out for pizza. When we went to pick up the trail magic cooler....one hiker, was enjoying the refreshments. He told us Ace, another hiker, stopped short of here and was already in his tent. We hiked down and delivered trail magic to Ace. Even though I only hiked until 2:00...it was a marvellous day for a hike.","Brassie Brook Shelter

I am very blessed. I don't ask, but my brother, sisters and friend Susan have helped me out soo much getting on and off the trail. My family takes a trip to a small lake in Michigan every year. I was going to skip it this year but my daughter only makes it up from Texas every three or four years. This was the year to come up and introduce my granddaughter to my brother and sisters familys. So I wasn't going to miss it. A fellow hiker once told me that I was quick with a smile. Well I'm not going to say exactly that she gets it from me, but baby Abigail is also quick with a smile. She is a very happy girl. It took a while to warm up to me and I even considered shaving my beard if she wouldn't have warmed up to me. That little angel is the only one I would have considered shaving for. Yes...she already has me wrapped around her little finger. I have been blessed with great daughter who is a wonderful person, mother and role model for Abigail. She knew what she was doing when she chose a husband too. I could not ask for a better son in law. He has a great personality, would help anyone and does a great job taking care of his family. One common denominator of all these people is they all believe Christ is their Saviour. To any unbelievers out there it is not by chance that I have all this awsome family around me but a solid foundation in Christ that was intoduced by my parents. I am truly a blessed man.","Home

Today was the day to get back to hiking. I still had 3 1/2 hour drive of the 12 hour trip to get back to the trail. The trip was very pleasant, traffic was actually pretty light and there were no traffic jams the whole trip. My sister and I were going to eat at the cafe by the hotel but it wasn't open when we left so we decided to stop later for brunch. Time flew by and there were not a lot of places to stop and eat. When we got off a highway at 10:30 there was a cool dinner that sat right off the road. It kind of looked like a really wide train car made out of aluminum. It was wide and also reminded me of a double wide pre-manufactured building. Maybe the first of its kind. The waitress told us it was built in 1957. There was a addition on the back of it where the kitchen was at. After a few photos we were back in the car headed on to Great Barrington where I left the trail ten days earlier. My sister wanted to hike some so we parked the car ahead and got a shuttle back to where I left the trail. My sister also brought trail magic, pop, Gatorade, apples and snickers. We left it close to the car so we could retrieve it when we returned to the car. As we were driving back the shuttle driver pulled over to pick up a hiker hitching a ride. It was a guy from Germany who I had once ate lunch with. We rode a little further and was dropped off at the trail. We had a quick photo op and was soon hiking into the woods. My sister kept telling me about all the poison ivy around but I have never got poison ivy and never realized how much was around me. After just a short ways we came out of the woods and into a corn field. My sister laughed and said I could have done this back home. The corn was pretty low still and I think the lack of rain is the reason. They always say knee high by the fourth of July. It was knee high but these days corn is usually way past that by the fourth. We crossed a road and were back to the woods and heading up. It was a nice climb not too challenging but challenging enough for my sister and my first day back on trail. It soon leveled off and was just a good hiking trail with a few inclines and declines and large rocks from time to time. We past a couple of people taking a break and one was Spike...another German I had been around a month ago. I said hi and on we went. We got to one scenic view and stopped for some pictures. We had stopped for a water break a short time earlier so didn't stay long. We did a few more miles and came to a shelter. We stopped for a quick snack and a thru hiker that was camping came up to greet us. While we were talking we heard a large group of voices heading our way. It was at least a dozen of kids probably 12-17 coming in to camp. The thru hiker said ""I'm out of here."". and went back to his tent. Me and my sister finished our snack and talked to a couple of the kids. The thru hiker came back and said those kids are pretty cool...they were respectful and asking about his trip and all wanted to shake his hand. He said he decided to go ahead and stay. My sister and I hiked the last mile back to her car. Some of the trail magic was gone and we packed the rest up and loaded it in her car. She gave me water to fill my bottles and a few snacks. We said our goodbyes and I was off. It was an odd feeling...being around family constantly for the last ten days and now being back in the woods all by myself. It wasn't the grand adventure feeling I had when I first started this trip because I now knew what to expect. It was a little bit of a downer but I just needed to get moving and back in my grove. It took me a little over an hour to make it to the shelter. A sign greeted me saying they have had frequent bear activity here. I was hoping I wasn't the only person camping here. A couple of other tents were up a d they had a bear box so that was all good. I read through the trail log to see if there were any names I recognized and there weren't. I set my tent up, got a quick bite to eat and was in my tent by 7:30 to escape the bugs. It was a great day for a hike and I'm sure my sister would agree","Great Barrington MA

Happy July 4th!!! I made through the night with out any bear activity. I actually slept really well. I fell asleep early and had to finish my journal when I woke up. I had to gather things up quickly because waiting at the door of my tent were a bunch of mosquitos. I considered spraying some deet on me but as long as I was moving I kept from getting bit. I was looking at just over 15 miles today and going to the Upper Goose Pond Cabin. You can swim, canoe and they have pancakes for breakfast. Everyone stops at this shelter and being a holiday it worked out great. It was a good day hiking, the terrain was tame for the most part and not too many hills. Im not in bad shape but can tell I've been off trail a few days. I think it is both physical and mental. I did 15 miles in just over six and a half hours, and was ready to be done. I got to the cabin just after 2:30. Took some time to relax and then went and soaked my feet in the water. No one else was swimming and it was late enough I'm not sure my clothes would dry so I elected not to swim. Getting into camp so early the day seemed long. Tomorrow I'll try to push a few more miles and see how it goes. It wasnt one of my longest days but it was a beautiful day for a hike","Mt Wilcox South Shelter

I got a good night sleep at the cabin. There was a party boat in the lake last night and I wondered if they would be up all shooting fireworks but they didn't seem to be. It did start raining during the night so I was glad I didn't have to pack up a wet tent. I was up at 6:00 and ready to hike by 7:00 and tooknoff before the pancakes were ready. I think I have found some hikers hiking my pace, Echo, ORoy and three others. We had a little bit of a climb to start the day off and then it leveled off before dropping down to the town of Dalton. I missed the pancakes but not far into my day I ran into trail magic times two. The first had water and a couple sodas. I downed a water, I needed a water bottle to use as a scoop when water sources are shallow. I got hydrated and got a scoop. My old one was getting kind of nasty and I threw it away when I was home. I crossed a road and there was more trail magic. A case of PBR beer and some fruit. Since I just downed the water...I wasn't real thirsty so I just grabbed an apple. About nine miles in I stopped at a shelter for lunch and then headed out to the cookie ladies house. She has a place for hikers to eat and has sodas and candy for sale. She also has blue berry bushes you can pick and eat from. She was gone so there were no cookies and it didn't seem to be blue berry season either. I read the log book and it seems that my old hiking partner Bumble Bee had been there the day before. That surprised me because she was weeks ahead of me before I took my last break. She is a day ahead so we will see if I catch her. ORoy and I kept leap frogging each other throughout the day. Later in the day I ran into a flipflopper named retainer. I passed him and we had a short conversation. When I got to Dalton and was looking at a map he caught up with me. We decided to go to a bar for dinner. When we sat down I recalled running into him one day and he was heading southbound. Being a flip flopper he was doing a section southbound and has since came back north and is heading northbound. We ate dinner and decided to hike another four miles to a campsite. I stopped for ice cream and Retainer decided to push .on. I made it to the shelter a litre after 7:00 and met Carl. He is 67 and has been on the trail three times since 1978. He has done everything south of here and is heading to main to complete the entire trail.

I had a good nights sleep and was back on the trail just after eight. ORyan made it in late because he stopped in Dalton and watched a high school baseball game. I talked to him and he said he was coming into camp last night and turned a corner and a bear was sleeping just off the trail. They startled each other and the bear got up and ran off. I have always wondered what goes on outside of my tent at night. Today's hike included quite a bit of elevation gain. We came into the town of Cheshire and dropped to under 1000 ft and then climb Mt Graylock at just under 3500 ft. As I was hiking I came to an intersection of another trail. After I passed it I noticed a guy with his German Sheppard. I kept walking an a short while later I hear the large dog barreling towards me barking. I just stopped and looked down and he stopped as he got to me and barking. The owner called him.off of me. After I moved on, I wish I would have told him to put that dog on a leash because what if I would have been a kid and started running who knows what would have happened. The guy obviously didn't have control of him. That was probably the most scared I have been on the trail. So, I was one of the later ones out of camp and passed Charlie just as he was getting into Cheshire. We hiked to the Duncan Doughnuts and found three other hikers there, Retainer, Wishing Bone and Puck. Everyone was fueling up for the climb we had ahead of us. I found the breakfast sandwich with the most calories and ordered that and an OJ...also got a Mt Dew before I left. Charlie and I were the last two out and I passed Wishing Bone, who stopped to take a break, and then I caught Puck soon after. We ended up hiking together up to Mt Graylock. He had been in the Marines and worked for National Security. He had some good stories and the hike up the mountain went surprisingly fast. We got there around 2:00. They had an observation tower but they were renovating it and had scaffeling all the way around it all the way to the top. We grabbed a bite to eat at the lodge and filled our water bottles. I ran into one hiker I met at the Doyle in Duncannon and had camped at a few shelters together after that. She was surprised to see me...I told her I just came off a ten day break. There were several other hikers up there too. On the way down the mountain Puck and I were going at different speeds and leap frogged each other a few times. Before I got to the campground I passed another small town but I had been eating too good and had to pass up the Poppa Johns Pizza. I did run into ORyan and sat down for a break though. I had 1.5 miles to the campsite. By this time I was dragging, but made it in by 6:30. I met another hiker named Gentle Ben and visited with him while I was eating. There seems to be quite a few hikers I enjoy being around in this area. It heated up a little late afternoon but with no doubt it was a great day to be on the trail.","Crystal Mountain Campsite

When I got up I was thinking 26 but the heat, humity and uphill first thing told me that wasn't going to happen. The gnats were back in full force to hovering around your eyes and ears. There was no town food so that wasn't any motivation either. Gentle Ben took off ahead of me. I stopped to put some Off on and that seemed to help the gnat situation a little but after a while I broke down and put my head net on. That really helped...I figured they would be hovering out side of it but they weren't. I was already sweating and didn't have a lot of energy. I got to a stream and found Gentle Ben and was surprised...he was slowed down by the heat also. I filtered my water and pressed on. I stopped at the first shelter 6 miles down the trail and stopped at the entrance trail and threw my sleeping mat out so I could sit down for a break. I really didn't want to hike the .2 miles to get to the shelter. Another hiker was there so we talked before he moved on. A few minutes later Puck came down the trail. He stayed at that shelter. It seems he hung his food bag and a mouse chewed a whole into it didn't like what he found and moved on to another hikers food bag. Puck moved on and I kept snacking. I think I'm okay with a day of heat but the continuous days of heat is wearing on me. I got a few more miles down to the next water source and found Puck getting water. We biked together for the rest of the day...well until I got to my shelter. He was going to put more miles in. It helped having someone to hike with at the same speed made the afternoon/miles go faster. We stopped at another shelter and had a quick lunch. We came to a road crossing and I ran into Ranger. I didn't recognize her but she said I know you. Then I remembered going to Hotdog Johnnies at Delaware Water Gap with her. She had a friend pick her up. Puck and I took a break and started up the next mountain. I was at the shelter by 6:00 and found it crowded with all new faces. I had dinner and good conversation before turning in. Some of the hikers are hiking the Vermont Long Trail. It runs with the AT and turns off after 100 miles. One couple said it was going to take them 6 weeks to hike it. A thunderstorm is rumbling and seems to be heading our direction. Hopefully it will bring some cooler temperatures. Oh yeah...I went over the 1600 mile mark, less than 600 to go and I am now in Vermont. I'm down to my last three states, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.

We got some rain overnight and it seemed to cool things off. There was thunder in the distance but it never made it too close to the campsite. I don't know why, but I seem to sleep well when it is raining. It was done raining by morning and I was determined to start early so I could take it easier during the afternoon heat. I went to get my food bag and noticed Payday wrappers on the ground....something had gotten into my food bag. I pulled it down and sure enough there were holes in the top of it. I took it to the picnic table to examine it and just by chance I put my trash on top of the bag and the only thing they got were empty wrappers. So there is a hole in my bag but it could have been worse. Tonight my trash is in the top of my bag once again. I sure miss the bear boxes they had in Massachusetts. I put my mp3 player on for the first time on the trail so I could listen to some tunes...since yesterday was a little bit of a struggle. I was on the trail by 6:30 and had a gradual uphill the first 8 miles then most of the afternoon would be down hill. After a couple of miles I caught up with a guy I camped with. We chatted for a couple of miles then he had to stop for a breather...I pressed on. The day was much different than yesterday. The humidity and temperature were much lower. My T-shirt wasn't soaked after the first half hour. I stopped for some water and started slipping on a rock. My arm went up and there went my MP3 player flying into the stream. I did listen to three songs on it to this point...lol. It stopped working...I will try it again after it dries out. I was feeling good all day. After the morning climb the afternoon miles went fast. I did get off trail at one point and then got turned around...then started heading the wrong direction. Luckily, Sticks who I had met at the last shelter wasn't too far behind and stopped me before I went far. I got to the shelter just before five and had 21 miles for the day. I had dinner and the campsite wasn't far from a parking lot. A trail angel brought up some ice cream for us. It was a wonderful day for a hike.","Melville Nauhelm Shelter

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541532,"It rained quite a bit of rain during the night. I wake up periodically and check to ensure everything is staying dry... the tent is doing its job. While I'm packing up the guy that gave us ice cream last night comes up and offers us coffee. He was staying in a camper not far from where we camped. I was up and on the trail at 6:30. I planned to make it to town for a resupply, shower, wash clothes and a good nights sleep. I have 18 miles to go and would like to get to town relatively early. I have a 1600 ft climb to start the day and then it flattens out. I climb Stratton Mountain and there is wooded. There is a fire tower but it is in the clouds so I will get no view. This is the mountain that inspired Benton MacKeye to propose the creation of the AT back in the 1920s. I head down the mountain and take a break at the next shelter. I call the hostel and they are booked for the night. I then call a couple of hotels and they are busy this weekend and have doubled the price that my guide book has listed. So I am hoping to find another hiker to split a hotel room with me. I make my way another 5 miles and find Puck at the next shelter. He tells me Gentle Ben is cancelling his reservation at the hostel and going to the hotel with a few other people. So I call the hostel to get that spot. We make it to the road by 1:30 and try to hitch a ride in. It is pouring down rain at this point and Puck and I are not having much luck. A car pulls into the parking lot to drop off some hikers. Puck asks if they can take us back to town and they agree. They are hikers and waiting for the weather to clear before they head out. We get to town, get some lunch and resupply at the grocery. We meet Gentle Ben there and he says he decided to go to the hostel after all. So I figure I am heading back to the trail at this point...no biggie. Puck calls the hostel and the owner agrees to let me sleep on the floor. I am fine with that...shower and wash clothes are my two main objectives. So the hostel owner picks us up and takes us to the hostel. When we get there he tells me he has one other option for me...the dog house. We laugh and then he says seriously...and shows me his barn that he has set up for people with dogs. It has bunk beds and mattresses with linens. I agree to stay there. Its actually pretty nice and I get the place to myself. I go into the hostel and find Subman and Suds who have a trail journal and I met a few weeks back. I go upstairs and find Romonte who I sheltered with the night we were supposed to get hit by a big storm. Later a couple come in looking for Subman and Suds. It is Rabbit...I have been following this guy the whole trip. He started ten days before me and I was reading his journal before I left to start mine. I figured I would catch him but never did. He got lyme disease and had to get off trail for a while. He is back on the trail now but came back to see his friends. It was a good day hiking...with the rain the temperatures were in the 50s. Other than wet feet I will take this weather over the heat and humidity. These Vermont trails are pretty smooth but the rain overnight made the rocks and roots slippery. Sometimes you have a choice of a wet rock and a mud puddle so you pick which looks the safer of the two. Even though it was a little sloppy on the trail it was a great day to hike.","Kelly Stand Rd Campsite

I had good miles yesterday so I was in no hurry to get back to the trial and elected to take the late 9:00 shuttle. This hostile has a full kitchen and you can make your own breakfast. I made some pancakes and shared with Puck, seeing I had made too many. Puck, Gentle Ben, Demaonti, and I got to the trail about 9:30. It was a cold rain but I decided to go without the raincoat. We were heading uphill and you warm up in the hills anyway. The climb was about 1500 ft in four miles. It was a good climb and we made good time. At the top of Bromley Mt there was a ski resort. Also there was a warming shelter they left open so I stopped there ready for a break. I was joined by my other shuttle mates and Comet, another hiker I had been seeing the last few days. The good thing about my clothes is the way they use the wicking material. I was not all that wet and the building we were in was quite stuffy so I opened the window. Later another hiker came in, in his rain gear and I don't know if it was raining harder but it was hard to believe how wet he was. I hiked with Puck most of the day and it rained off and on all day. We went another 5 miles and stopped at the shelter for lunch. I wanted to get my shoes off and air my feet out. I got a couple of bites or something on my toes and the constant moisture is not letting them heal. We stayed about an hour then pressed on. For some reason there were three more shelters coming up in the next two miles...we were heading for the last. The trail was muddy all day and you try to keep your feet out of the mud but after so much time it doesn't matter and you just walk straight through the middle of the trail. At some places the water buildup was pretty deep and one particular step it came up to the top of my sock. A lot of places you have a choice of mud slick rocks or slick roots. You choose what looks safest and go with it. We get to the next Mountain peak and it is boulders...the kind that sit at an angle and have small crevices. Being wet it is very dangerous and slow going. This would be a challenge on a dry day but a wet day it is zoo much more challenging. About half way up I say to Puck, I'm surprised they didn't have an alternate route for bad weather. So we make it up and fortunately the down side is just a dirt trail. I couldn't imagine going down those wet boulders. We go a little ways and see a trail off to the side that is the alternate trail for bad weather...guess we missed it on the other side of the peak...not that I would have taken it anyway. We had several over looks today but all we seen were clouds. We pressed on and got to camp about 5:30. It was a cool day with no bugs just wet feet, and a sensational day for a hike.","Manchester Center, Green Mountain House Hostel

It was cool and I had my sleeping bag wrapped around me most of the night. While I was packing my tent, Subman and Suds stopped by. They were two campsites back and said it was crowded and tents were pitched too close together. The addition of Long Trail hikers has really crowded the shelters and campsites. I went to get my food bag and it seemed the critters had struck again. This time they got some potato chips. I talked to Puck and it seems he was hit too. He has been hit the last three nights he has been at a shelter. I think it's chipmunks. I made it out of camp by 8:00. The rain had stop and the sun was out. The trail was still sloppy and there were areas that seemed you were walking down a stream. We have got a lot of rain in the last 48 hours and it will take a while for the trail to dry out. I made it to the first shelter pretty quick but it was .2 off trail so I pressed on to find somewhere on the trail to have lunch. I was hoping to find some sunshine to dry some things out but no luck so I stopped at a shady campsite...threw out my sleeping mat and sat down for a nice break. I started hiking again and not more than a quarter mile was an parking lot with lots of sunshine. Oh well...you win some and lose some. The trail is pretty nice trip to hike...just some mud makes it a little less desirable. During a the afternoon I came to an overlook. It was a good view below of a small airport. What made it even better was a white plastic chair was sitting there. I couldn't pass that up so I sat down and watched a couple of planes take-off and land. I hiked on...the next road was a restaurant. I got to the restaurant at 3:15 and it seemed they closed at 3:00. The owner made me a burger and fries anyway...I even got some ice cream. She was leaving but told me to sit outside as long as I wanted. I was there a little over an hour and dried some socks and shoes and charged my phone. I was back on the trail by 5:00 and got another six miles in. I passed a guy hiking the long trail. He sped up and we hiked together and had good conversation. I made it to camp just before 8:00. Just enough time to set up my tent, brush my teeth and get my food bag hung. Tonight I put a bottom of a Gatorade bottle on the rope above my bag to hopefully spoil anymore attempts to get my food.

I asked Gentle Ben the next morning and he thought it was an owl above his tent. The rest of the night was peaceful. I tossed and turned it seemed most of the night... I even slept at the opposite side of the tent so my feet would be lower than my head. I was up and on the trail by 8:00. Not long into the hike I came across some youth maintenance crew. They were working on some rocks that were made into steps. Looked like some pretty intense work. Then it was a 2000 ft climb up....it wasn't too steep, just took a little while to get up. At the top there was a blue trail that went to the peak that overlooked Killington VT, it went straight up and a little challenging. I met a guy and his daughter and he was giving me the highlights of what was around. With all of the uphill we now got to go down into Killington. If it was early enough there would be time to stop at a deli. I went about halfway down and had lunch with Gentle Ben. He is from Idaho and a very talented guitar player as I heard the other night at the hostel. We passed where the Long Trail split off so we wouldn't be seeing anymore Long Trail hikers after this. I was surprised at the amount of them. We hiked down the rest of the way and came to a State Park. I stopped for a root beer and Ben kept going. I wish I would have kept going to the deli because time was running short and I had 7 miles left to go. I passed a lodge and stopped to fill up my water bottles and then it was time to head back up a mountain. It was about 900 ft up but it was pretty straight up...it just seemed to keep going and going. About two thirds up I stopped for a break and have a snack... I needed energy. I made it to the top and it leveled off before it dipped down and went back up two more times. Then it was back down to camp. I made it before 7:00 and was ready to be done. Tomorrow the heat returns and the rain chances are back the day after. Yesterday I passed the 1700 mile mark and have less the 500 miles to go.

I was with some early birds as I was the second to last one out of camp. I had a long day planned and the temperature was suppose to be warming up again. There wasn't much for flat but pretty much up and down all day. I met a couple of teachers from the west coast...Oregon or Washington. They didn't have trail names even though they have been coming out a month for the last six years. So they use their real names, Jeff and Jen. I laughed and said thats funny because I have twin cousins with the same names. I didn't push too hard this morning because I knew it was going to be a long day and I didn't want to use all my energy up. I did make decent time though. I got to a place called the overlook. It was a cabin a quarter mile off trail and had a deck built onto the top of it. I went up and had a magnificent view. It was open and you could actually stay inside the enclosed cabin. I left there and made if to the 13 mile mark before I stopped for lunch. I found a breezy place on top of a mountain and enjoyed a half hour break. Up and down mountains were the afternoon agenda. I made it to one road and someone yelled "" Stiripe is that you?"". It was Secret Agent and Garfield. They have slowed their pace and were waiting for Stitch to catch up. She had been off trail a week for a wedding. I hiked with them a couple of miles and moved on after getting water at a stream. I passed another hiker and he told me a market listed in our guidebook closed at 5:00. It was going to be close so I pushed harder so I would make it on time. We had the steepest climb ahead of is. I was walking on a board walk and a creature was standing on the last one and hissed at me. It startled me and I jumped back. He was sitting and at first in thought it was a beaver but turned out to be a ground hog. I took a couple of pictures then tapped my sticks together and hit them on the boards and he wasn't moving. I was going to go around until another hiker showed up. He took some pictures and I guess the two of us intimated him because he soon scurried off into the woods. I pushed hard to get to the marked and even passed up trail magic so I wouldn't be late. I got there and they were closed. It was a small place and it was a restaurant but you had to have advanced reservations. I filled my water bottle at the spigot and sat in the shade as I was soaking wet from sweat. The other hiker soon joined me for a break in the shade. As we were sitting there a car pulled up. It was the owner and she offered to open for us. I got a locally made rootbeer with no artificial ingredients and a quart of ice cream. On the opposite side of the building we found some rocking chairs in the shade. There was also a nice breeze to cool us off. We were expecting more of a convenience store but this worked out.

I made it up by 7:00 and was on the trail just after 8:00. I passed a south bounder and he told me there were some bees on the trail and it was marked with notes. I came to it and stayed in the middle of the trail and had no issues. I have really enjoyed this Vermont trail...it has its ups and downs but the trail itself is pretty smooth and has been easy on the feet. After the bees I come to a road the the AT follows and it crosses a bridge. In the middle of the bridge is an X that marks a spot you can jump into the river. It is a pretty high jump. It was 10 AM and no one else was around so I elected to skip this challenge. I get over the bridge and a guy calls me over to his house and offers me a soda and some snacks. He also offered me breakfast but I turned that down. I chatted for about 20 minutes and headed on. There were thunderstorms in the forecast and in was hoping to get to Hanover NH. That's right one more state was going to be in the history books. I got to the next shelter about noon and there was a south bounder and a section hiker there. The section hiker was an older lady and I enjoyed the conversation and was there about 45 min. Now I was racing time...weather forecast and I could get a shower if I was there before 5:00. I made good and was actually there by 3:30. I had crossed the New Hampshire state line and Hanover is a college town...home of Dartmouth. I was walking to the outfitters and heard a knock on the window. I looked and it was Riser. I hadn't seen him since before Harpers Ferry...so I went in and ate and drank a beer with him. He told me Black Bear was back on trail...he had a skin eating bacteria that sent him home. I wondered if he would make it back. Riser also told me Highlander thew in the towel and was off the trail. That surprised me because he was putting videos on YouTube. A lot of times people get a lot of followers and it keeps them going and motivated. I went to the outfitter and got another pair of socks, one pair of mine are wearing thin. I then went to the community center for a shower. It was too late to do laundry but I could get some dirt off me. I also washed my T-shirt in the shower. It is a tec shirt and a lot of dirt came out of it and it dried fast. I still had a clean pair of underwear and new socks so the only thing dirty I was putting on were my shorts. I went to the store to resupply. While I was shopping the thunderstorm hit. We got a lot of rain and it was a pretty good storm. I sat inside and waited it out. One lady offer to take me home...she said her son was bringing a friend home and it would be crowded but they would find a place for me. I persuaded her I would be okay and she went on her way. I was in the store probably an hour and a half before it cleared up. I was headed to the next shelter and seen a sign that it was only .8 miles away. I decided to go back .7 miles to a Subway before leaving town. I ate and headed for the shelter. On the way up I passed a couple. Thinking back I remembered them the night before I started the trail at the hostel. They started in Alabama and hiked to Georgia. It is kind of crazy who and when you run into people here.

I was on the trail around 8:15. It was a warm day but the humidity had dropped. The first climb started out rougher, as in more rocks to climb up and not the smooth trail. Welcomed to New Hampshire. Coming down the mountain was the same...with the wet rocks I went down once. I was down before I could even think about it. The trail smoothed out from there. Water was a little more sporadic so I planned accordingly. Don't like carrying too much up the mountains but want to have enough also on these warm days. The morning ended with a nice 1200 ft climb up Moose Mt. I made it a little over nine miles by noon and stopped at a lookout for lunch. I took my shoes off to let my feet air out. Last Sunday my feet were looking kind of rough(trench foot?), but I've been putting powder on them and airing them out at lunch and as soon as I get to camp, they are recovering nicely. While I was sitting there, a few hikers from my past ventured up and joined me. Swiss couple Criss Cross and Sun Ray, and Ish, who is from Israel. I hadn't seen them since Virginia. So we talked about the locations of other hikers we both knew. I got moving I had 11 miles left to go. The first half if the afternoon was downhill. I made it about 5 miles and came to Bill Ackerlys house. He has always had signs pointing hikers to his house a tenth of a mile off trail for ice cream, water, a chair in the shade and a game of crocket. Bill passed away at the age of 89 this spring and his family agreed to keep this going the rest of the year for the hikers. They said he loved visiting with the hikers and seldom lost a game of crocket. I stayed a little longer than expected and charged up my phone.

I made it through the night with no bear encounters either. The plan today was to hike 20 miles and get to a hostel to get clean, fed and resupplied before starting the White Mountain Range on Monday. I was the first out of camp at 7:30. That means I get to clear the spider webs for the ones coming behind. At one area I had my treking poles up going through some vegetation and I looked up and there was a perfect round web between my two poles. I'd have loved to take a picture but I only have two hands and they were on the poles. The terrain has changed and we are hiking on more rocks, boulders and slabs of rocks now. There is still dirt trails between the piles of rocks. I made it to a beautiful overlook and chatted with a couple of day hikers. He had thru hiked in 2002. I was making good time and continued on. Heading down the mountain I passed a day hiker Stiles...he thru hiked the AT last year. He gave me a power water which was most appreciated and on I went. I made it ten miles by noon and waiting for me was a bag of trail magic. It had healthy food in it and bread and turkey. I was going to pass on the turkey but it was still cold so I made a sandwich and it was really good. Had some dried mangos and chocolate covered pretzels. There was a bag of something that looked sweet and good. I took a handful and started eating and they were not sweet but had a hot kick to them. I finished what I had in my hand and had a few more pretzels. During the afternoon I had a couple of short climbs and the rest was down hill. I made good time. Towards the end I hit a large rock and hyper extended my knee. I thought oh boy...I was able to walk it off though and think its going to be okay. The trail is taking its toll on my body though. I have felt a little discomfort in my ankle and yesterday it locked up on me. I tried to stretch it to no avail, so I put weight on it and went slow and it finally loosened up for me. I was able to make it to the hostel by 4:00. Sitting in the common room was Spirit of 76. She didn't recognize me anymore...at least at first. I hadn't seen her since I went home with the leg injury at week six when we were both at Woods Hole Hostel. I got my stuff done before heading to bed. Everyone is ready for the White Mountain Range that includes the Presidential Mountains. People have bee talking about this since Georgia. We finally get above tree line and the weather is some of the most unpredictable in the country. You have to be ready for winter weather. Mount Washington has had the highest wind ever recorded on earth. Lots of rocks and boulders mean lower mile days and you have to pick where you will be staying wisely. There are some Huts(places, resorts for rich people) but they are very pricey. Sometimes they allow thru hikers to work for stay. If the weather turns too bad they have to let you stay or you become a liability to them. They generally keep their guests and thru hikers separated though. The next 100 miles are going to be a challenge but the views will be some of the best to date where you can see forever 360 degrees. After the Whites we are in Maine. Hopefully the weather will cooperates for the next week...wet rocks will really slow things down. The weather was great today as it was a beautiful day for a hike.","Fire Wardens Cabin

I was up and started laundry before breakfast at 7:00. I was going to zero here today but they didn't have a very good resupply and I may end up spending a night in Lincoln...I need to get to an outfitter for new shoes badly. So I wasn't worried about big miles today and left the hostel at 10:30. Today's hike was up Mt Moosilauke...a step grade up over 3700 ft, and a steeper downhill on the other side. Spirit 76 left before me but came back after she encountered a pitbull type dog on the trail that didn't seem too friendly. The dog later appeared at the hostel. So we left together for the trail and went up at a steady pace and took a couple of breaks on the 4 mile up hill climb. This was the beginning of us going above treeline...which we will continue to do the next 100 miles. Some clouds moved in as we climbed and we also noticed the temperatures were cooling as we could start to see our breath. We made it above treeline and the views were amazing...well what we could see as the clouds moved through. Looking up we could see there were a lot of day hikes on the peak. We got to the top and found Shutterbug (a hiker from from the hostel) sitting taking a break. I took a few pictures and we sat and joined him. He had been hiking with five other hikers and they have all since left the trail for various reasons. Comet I had seen at the ski warming hut had turned around right after I had seen her and went home...I was sad to hear that I was there when she decided to quit and she never said a word. We talked to a group of four kids that were very interested in our journey. After about a hour we started heading down the other side...it wasn't steep at first but that soon changed. Fortunately it hadn't rained since early this morning so the rocks were just damp and not super wet. This was some of the steepest and slowest areas we have hiked...and it continued all the way down. Some places had 8x8 pieces of lumber attached to the rocks for steps. The water was flowing beside up turned into a waterfall as we continued down. At one point Shutterbug took a pretty hard fall head first and bumped his head on a large rock before rolling onto his back and ending in an awkward position beside the rock. He was able to catch himself enough that he had no serious injuries but a small cut on his ear. I helped him up and he brushed himself off and we continued. Some of the rocks had rebar drilled into it for handholds. We finally made it down by 5:00 and found a place to stealth camp( not a designated camp area). It had a fire ring so we started a fire and enjoyed the evening visiting. We even stayed up until a late 9 pm. It was great hiking with these two. It was a slow hike but the amazing 360 degree views and seeing the White Mountain Range ahead of us was awesome. Yes, it was a beautiful day for a hike.","Glencliff NH (Hiker Welcome Hoste

Shutterbug said good morning sleeping beauty as he was heading out...the funny thing is I had met a guy with that trail name a few days earlier. Spirit of 76 wasn't far behind him getting on the trail. I was heading to town...the only reason I was in a hurry was so the ranger didn't catch me in this unapproved campsite. I was out on the road a little after seven with my thumb in the air. There wasn't a lot of traffic and seven or eight cars passed me by. Then to my surprise a little white sports car pulled over. I let him know I needed to go to an outfitter six miles down the road and we had some small chit chat. I asked what he did and he said he was a judge. I laughed and said that mist be an interesting job..he said yeah never a dull moment. As we got to town he told me where he thought I would have the most luck and dropped.me off at The Pancake House where I could wait for the stores to open. I are and went and got a few things from the stMurrell had WiFi so I took care of a little business and by the time I was done the store(Lahouts) was open and I got my new shoes. My fourth brand of show, I started with Keen boots, switched to Socany trail runners and then used Murrell through the rocks of PA and now tried Salomon. The last three pair had a lot of mesh so when they got wet they would dry fast. The Murrell wore out fast but nothing would have held up through the rocks of PA. I stopped back by the store to get a sandwich, apple and chocolate milk for lunch and started walking towards the trail. After I got past a major road I threw my thumb up and the second vehicle stopped and picked me up. This guys trail name was Stealth and he is thru hiking and broke his foot. He lives in the area so he is home providing trail magic to hikers. He dropped me off and I was on the trail by 12:30. I planned on doing 11 miles but these White Mountains are no joke and it took me until 4:30 to get the first 7 in. I could have pushed on but I had a 2000 ft climb so decided to wait until tomorrow for that. I was greeted at the shelter by a couple of hikers from Quebec and a hiker I'd seen a couple of times named B-hiker. She stopped early because she heard it was supposed to rain...but the skies were clear. I did my chores and ate with B-hiker a little after 5:00. We heard some rumbling and by 6:30 a nice little thunderstorm moved in. I was glad I decided not to have pushed on and got stuck in that. I waited it out in the shelter and got some intel from a couple of southbound hikers. I headed to the tent soon after it was over. I usually write my journal before going to sleep but have been tired and gone to sleep the last Coue of nights before I get it done. I'll wake up during the night and finish it then go back to sleep until morning. There were no amazing views in the Whites today but that is soon going to change. The trail is more big rocks and it is going to be really muddy where its not tomorrow. More slow hiking with mud and wet rocks but you take what you get.

After that it was a 2000 ft climb up Kinsman Mt and not real easy on the steep wet rock, roots, water running down the trail and water sitting on the trail. One spot had boardwalks but they were under water too. The miles don't fast but that's okay...I will just take them as they come. At the top of the mountain was foggy so no views for me.

We were on the trail before 10:00 and hoping to get 15 miles to Crawford to resupply food and camp. I was hiking with Spirit of 76 and Shutterbug again and we had a 1500 ft climb up South Twin Mountain. Before we left the hut several other NorthBound hikers showed up at the hut. They were able to do some work too and get some leftovers. The first half of the day we bad a couple of mountains to go over and the afternoon was flat and downhill. We got to the next hut a little after 1:00 and were seven miles in for the day. We bought a bowl of potato soup and lemon aid. A few hikers were there before us and others came in...I hadn't seen so many true northbounders at one spot in months. The three of us were the first out and we had the easiest part of the hike to go. Spirit hit a wet rock and down she went. She got up, dusted off and was just a little scuffed up. We laughed that the easy places that get you. We made it to Crawford Gap and hitched a ride 3.5 miles to a pay campground. In the Whites we have to pay at the shelters anyway and dividing the campspot by three the costs were about the same. After about 20 min a couple picked us up. They were vacationing.

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543185,It was a nice night at the campground. Our campsite didn't have electricity so we were up early at the restroom charging our electronics. We were going to get some breakfast at the store at 8:00 before we left. The Roman Noodles were at the road about 6:45 trying to hitch back to the trail and didn't get a ride until 7:30. We wondered how long we were going to have to wait for a ride. We were all packed and ready to gonwhen the camp store opened. We got our food and was sitting out on the bench when a minivan pulled up and asked if we were ready to go. We had met these folks last night and they actually brought us some steak tips for us to eat at our campsite. We loaded up and got to the trailhead. Thank them for their great kindness. The actually went out of their way to get has backnas they headed back the direction we just came. We sat and ate our breakfast before our climb up Mt Webster and then Mt Jackson. There were awesome views on the way up and we could see where we came from. There were numerous false summits where you would think you were at the top just to head down a little and then go back up. The rocks got bigger and steeper the higher we went. We finally made it up Webster. Jackson wasn't too bad to summit after that. The wind was getting stronger as the day went on. We ate on top of Jackson and then pressed on to the next hut. We got to the hut and checked the weather forecast to make sure we could pressd. We had our bowl of potato dill soup...it seems to be getting thinner at every hut. We talked with the Roman Noodles and decided to move on to the Lake of the Clouds Hut which is at the base of Mt Washington. Mt Washington is the second highest peek on the AT and above tree line. It is one of the most unpredictable weather patterns in the country and you can get winter conditions in the summer. Hiking to Lake of the Clouds is not too tough but has tougher areas. At one point the wind is blowing you sideways. The five mile hike ends with you dropping down into a bowl where the hut sits protected. We have a chance for work for stay but decide to leave that open for other hikers as we have already had that opportunity. Instead we pay $10 to stay in the dungeon. It is a room in the bottom of the hut that sleeps six persons. It has a funky basement smell and is dark stone with on window and a steel metal slab for a door. We can hang out up in the hut and just sleep in the dungeon. When they feed the guests we head outside and eat our own food. Three section hikers join us in the dungeon for the night. Two of the guests upstairs hear us talking about the dungeon and come down to check it out and talk to us about our thru hike. Later they bring us candy bars for desert. We had fantastic views all day...it is amazing to look around 360 degrees and see all the mountain ranges. The evening sky was outstanding with the red clouds and beams of sun shooting down.

By 5:30 morning there were just some residual clouds and a great view/sunrise with Mt Washington. We were waiting until 7:00 to get the daily forecast and had breakfast. The forecast was for mostly cloudy skies with a chance or rain and thunderstorms in the afternoon. By the time we were ready to head up the fog had rolled in. So we headed up in the fog, carens(nicely piled up rocks) lead the way. We made it 1.5 miles by 8:30. Spirit of 76 headed up to the summit and Shutterbug and I checked out a building and some signs. The cloud still covered the mountain so we had no view and the wind was steady putting the windchill into the upper 30s. We found a nice place to take a break and went looking for Spirit of 76 and couldn't find her. We went all around the buildings and she was nowhere to be found. We thought she continued down the trail so down the trail we went. We were unable to find her so decided to go back and check around the buildings again. The fog was thick and visibility poor. I yelled for her and heard her answer. She had gone into the visitors center, we didn't think it was opened yet. We finally found each other. We went in the visitors center and looked around and charged our phones. We had some refreshments and B-Hiker caught up with us. We headed out and were going to be on ridge line above the treeline for the next six miles. The trail was rocky and we were going a little over a mile an hour. After a couple of hours the clouds cleared over Mt Washington and we stopped for a break and enjoyed the view. We got to hiking again and 20 minutes later we heard a rumble. We were heading to Thunderstorm Juncture and up over a the mountain. Soon after the first rumble another crack of thunder much closer got our attention. We got off the ridge, spread out, and knelt down. The rain was coming down and I got my sleep mat out and sat on one end and curved the other end over my head. After about 15 minutes we heard no more thunder and headed up to clear the top as soon as possible. We made it over and were relieved to be heading down. Madison Hut was less than two miles away and we continued at a quick pace. It was clearer on one side of us with dark clouds on the other side. We cleared the next upper ridge and found the view of the hut a quarter mile ahead. There was some more thunder and we continued to the hut. We made it to the hut and the rain picked up as we were heading inside. We got some soup and waited out the storm. We have Mt Madison ahead and need some time to get over it. After a half hour it clearing to one side of us but clouds are still on the opposite side of the mountain we just cleared. We asked the staff about work for stay here and there were ten hikers here so they were going to have to send someone on. There is a stealth campsite a quarter mile down a trail in the treeline. We are thinking about going to it when another storm blows in. Soon lightening hits close with a loud rumble. The girl in charge comes out and tells us that we can all stay. That was the last thunder we heard the rest of the day and it cleared a little before sunset. The turkey they made the guests was gone so they made us some pasta, bread, jam, salad, strawberries, a few mashed potatoes and brownie cheesecake. It was all fantastic and we all ate a lot. My crew, Spirit of 76, Shutterbug, B-Hiker and I did some evening dishes and cleaned up the kitchen. Soon after it was 9:30 and we were off to bed.

The skys were clear and we had great views. We headed down and the path started steeped and it was taking some time to get down. We made it below treeline which we hadn't been under for a few days. We continued down and crossed Auto Road around 12:30. This was the road that would take you to the top of Mt Washington. Shutterbug had hiked with a German couple. One of them got hurt and they had to go home. Well someone they knew left them a gift under a rock at Auto road by a sign. We found the sign and Shutterbug could not find the bag. Spirit said maybe there is another sign south of the road so Shutterbug went to look for it while the rest of us eat some lunch. B-hiker says her original plan was to summit on her 50th birthday. I said I could have done that too. I said mine is in Sept and she said so is mine. I tell her the day and her birthday is the same as mine. I laugh and say we are twins...or switched at birth and we have a laugh. None of this can be true as she was born in Germany. This is the first person I have ever met that was born on the same day and year as me. So now I have a trail twin. Tomorrow I think she is going to hike a little past where I stop so we will probably not see each other again after that. Shutterbug comes back with the package that was buried...it was a small American Flag. We finish eating and head out...we have a lot of miles to cover and the the last half is all up hill. We hike another two miles and stop at a visitor center for a sandwich and soda. I had a big turkey sandwich and Coke. We eat quick and chat with a hiker Shutterbug and B-hiker know. We are on the trail by 3:00 and have to go up Wildcat Mountain. We will climb up a ridge line and hit 4 of the 5 peeks this thing has. It starts level and then shoots straight up. We see some rock climbers climbing straight up a part that is just a rock face. We push up and the first main peek has a ski resort at the top. We keep going and it is a slow pace. It is a lot of up to a peek drop down and then up to another peek. We are all getting worn out and stop a little after 7:00 for a food break. After a long day we stop a stealth camp site at 8:30 and set up tents, eat dinner and get to bed after a long days hike.

We stopped to refill our water bottlas and then start up 1300 ft to Carter Dome. There are pretty much ups and downs all day until the last few miles. We have some pretty steep slopes and at times get slowed down to half mile an hour. It is kind of disheartening when thats all the faster you can go but the famous saying on the trail is ""you take what the trail gives you"". I feel like we put these time restraints on our day and we get a little frustrated when we are not doing it as quick we think we should be. Sometimes we just need to slow down and enjoy the hike. Life is the same way when we out our restraints on it...sometimes we just need to step back and not stress over it. We are a good hiking group and have talked about other hikers being negative. We were being negative and I make the statement I'm glad we are not like those negative hikers. We all get a good laugh. Late in the day we hit some good trail that we fly through. We get to the shelter just before 4:00. Our group is breaking up and we say some goodbyes. It was a great hike through the White Mountains...it had some challenges and I'm glad I didn't do it alone. Shutterbug and B-hiker have time restraints to meet and I am getting off trail for a few days to attend a wedding. Spirit of 76 will get there when she gets there with no set date on the table. I planned on being done with the entire trail this week but my leg injury pushed me back three weeks. I planned to be done before the wedding and went back and forth whether I would come off trail to go. I finally decided if I was working and needed to travel I would take the time off to attend so why not do the same now. I do not like leaving the trail but life goes on. I have two more days I could hike but tomorrow I hit a town that has a rental car service so I don't think I can push on until I return from the wedding.

I wasn't going to get an early start because I know I have to be in Gorham just two miles away to pick up a rental car on Thursday. But I got to thinking maybe I could hike another 30 miles and come back. So I got up and planned to be on the trail around 7:00. I was getting my bear rope down and for some unknown reason I pulled the end with the carabinier (closed hook) instead of the end with nothing. After I realized my mistake, I thought if I pulled it quick it would go up and over the branch and fall to the ground. But that didn't happen as the quick yank actually tighted around the branch. By this time Spirit was up and around and she seen my dilemma and stopped by to help. Those evergreen branchs are tough. The rope was out far enough that I pulled it down and Spirit held onto the end while I went to find a stick to reach up and untangle the rope. I couldn't find any long sticks and most of the long stuff turned out to be roots sticking out of the ground. We finally got a trekking pole and was able to get it down. We finished packing ate a quick bite and were heading to town by 7:00. The two miles were smooth and down a slight grade and not even pushing made it to the hostel that is on the trail in 30 minutes. We stopped and seen Shutterbug off and talked a minute to B-Hiker. I talked to the hostel owner about getting a shuttle ride back from 30 miles away. It was going to be $85 and she said it wasnt a good place to hitch because few cars take that road. And then after I go to the wedding it would cost $85 to get back. So I am going to go down to the campground and stay a couple of days until I pick up the rental car on Thursday. I hike down the road a couple of miles and hang out at the campground for the day.

I was on the trail a little after 7:00. First up was MT Success. Gummey Bear told me about a plane wreckage that was on the mountain. It was a nice climb and a great view at a clearing. I wasn't sure where the plane was at but I took a trail down and went for quite a while. The trail was not real clear and my legs got a little scrapped up from the trees and things that had grown by the trail. After going a good distance I was about to turn around when I seen something in the distance. Sure enough I had found it. There was no sign of the flight deck but there was a wing...parts of an engine and the back of the fuselage was somewhat in tact. I looked around and took a few pictures before heading back up. I got a little off course on the way back up but eventually found my way. I hadn't hit the peak of Mt Success yet but after about 10 minutes I was there and had a great 360 degree scenic view. Talked to a few section hikers and headed on. I got to the first shelter and realized it took 4.5 hours to do 5.5 miles. I was hoping to get 15 miles in today but with the toughest mile on the trail between here and there, I didn't think that was going to happen. I went over Goose Eye Mountain which has three peeks and found some trail maintainers working hard. I got to the next shelter by 2:30 and planned to got to the next shelter. I met Italia there who was from Italy. She told me there was a campsite just after Mahoosuc Notch ( tough boulder scramble). So I knew I could make that. I had a quick snack and pressed on. I passed some more trail maintainers. At one point I passed a guy working, I continued down the trail and then I heard a big rock rolling down the hill. I was too far away to see but I guess it got away from him. I made it to the notch and it was definitely going to be a challenge. The first thing you noticed, besides the boulders, was the air temperature dropped about 10 degrees. The scramble started out tough...you just had to take your time and figure out the route and then get good footing. I looked down a crevice and noticed there was snow at the bottom. This was definitely the most challenging part of the trail we have seen. A couple of times I had to take my pack off. One was a narrow passage and the other was a place you had to go under the boulders. One place I didn't know how to get around so I ended jumping from one boulder to the next. If I would have missed it wouldn't have ended well. I passed one hiker and joined another towards the end of the boulders and hiked to the campsite with her. It was an enjoyable mile and a nice challenge. Yesterday my knees were bothering me but they felt much better today. I got scrapped up a litre checking out the wreckage and later skinned up a leg when I slid down a boulder. I hit a tree trunk and got a thin but 3"" cut on my knee.

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544826,Another great night in the tent. I was the first on the trail at 6:45 so that means I get to clear all the cobwebs...until I meet someone coming from the other direction. I start the day with a 1900 ft climb and have a 2300 ft climb to look forward to later in the day. The terrain isn't bad to start out but gets a little tougher the higher I go. I feel like I'm learning to trust my footing more but maybe getting too confident. I can climb pretty steep with my trekking poles and just a little abnormality for traction. I meet a couple of college students out for a few days. One has joined the Peace Corp and is going to be spending the next 2.5 years in Africa. I press on hoping to get over 15 miles in today. Coming down the second mountain the terrain is steep but a quarter of the way down it starts leveling out and is the best I've seen in a while. I hope this continues tomorrow. Somewhere during the day I lost my water bladder. I went through a narrow passage between two rocks and thinking that's where it got hung up. I've still got two water bottles and one works with my filter so no biggie other than I can't back flush my filter for now. It was another gorgeous day. The gnats were back in full force after we have had a nice break from them. No new injuries to speak of so all in all it was a wonderful day to be hiking in Maine.,"Mahoosuc campsite

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544827,"I had my first night camping by myself. It really wasnt a camp site but my tent fit in the space nicely and I left no trace I was there. I did get on the trail by 6:30 to ensure no one important came along. Today was a day of familiar faces. The trail was nice in the morning but the afternoon had two climbs that went up at a steep incline. During the morning I ran into Old Fox. We hiked together and talked football, he is a Steelers fan and I a Browns fan. I had met him earlier in the hike. He lives in NY city and works in journalism and translates English to Chinese. He lived in Pittsburgh at one time and that's how he became a fan. While we were hiking we ran into a lady. I asked her what day she started and it was Feb 26 the same day as I started. We both stayed in the Hiker Hostel in GA. I don't remember her face but think I did talk to her and her husband there. Old Fox and I had hiked about 11 miles and was going to stop at a stream for lunch. We get there and Subman and Suds were sitting on a log. It is good to see friends you met on the trail. They left soon after we got there. We had gotten one of the steep climbs out of the way before lunch and had another 2200 ft climb ahead of us. I pushed on before Old Fox and figured he would catch up but that was the last I seen of him. Subman and Suds found a stealth tent site to stop at after heading down the mountain. They stopped me to ensure I had water because a hiker told them there was no water at the shelter I was heading to. Rabbit was with them, all of these people started Feb 15 and I followed their journals before I started my hike. Rabbit had gotten far ahead of me but got Lyme disease and was off trail recovering for a while. Even after he made it back be wasn't 100%. They invited me to camp with them but I wanted to make it to town on Friday and that would have slowed me down too much. I would have enjoyed the company though. I made it into camp a little after 6:00. I was surprised I had made it that far so soon. 19.5 miles in for the day....the longest in a while. The afternoon thunderstorms never developed and the gnats weren't bad. All in all it was a great day for a hike. I am tired.","Dunn Notch and Falls

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544828,"I got a good nights sleep and was ready to make it to town for food, resupply, shower and laundry. Remember yesterday I said it always good to see familiar faces? Well I was wrong. I was on the trail by 6:30 and making good miles. I stopped on top of a mountain peek for a break at 7:30. When I went to hike on what I thought was a path, was not a path. So I got to looking at the two options I had and wasn't real sure which one I came from. So I chose one...your first instinct is usually right, correct? So I head on and I still see spider webs so I must have chose right. About 30 minutes later I turn the corner and there is Suds. I throw my trekking poles to the side and ""no way man"". I was going to get to town late and now it was going to be later. So talking to her, they had not passed the shelter yet...that means I had been going the wrong direction for an hour and a half. Last night was kind of odd when I looking for blazes....I came across the shelter sign...I was off trail a little bit when I found the sign. So back we hike to the lean-to(that's what they call shelters in Maine). I am surprised when we get there in an hour. So I went back to where I started this morning and the trail split in two directions. There was a sign I had overlooked but also there were white blazes visible in both directions. I turned and seen the blaze and continued going. It seems there was a reroute this year and the old blazes were still visible. I don't know where all I went but it was much farther than it took us to get back. I really stayed pretty calm and the others said they would have been much worse. At this point I was hiking with Subman, Suds and Rabbit. It doesn't do any good to cry I said. At this point I had decided to stop short of town and hit it with these hikers tomorrow. It really worked out because I wouldn't be rushing to get things done. Just have to wait an extra day for that cheeseburger. One other bad thing was water was an hour and a half from where I started and I ended up walking five hours to get there. I had lost my water bladder earlier in the week and only had 22oz to start out and it was a pretty warm day. I kept drinking half of what I had left and finally made it to the stream by 11:30. The others offered me water but I was able to ration it until we got there. We stopped for lunch and to rehydrate. It had been seven miles since the last water and I added five miles to that. It has been dry in Maine this year and we were suppose to have had to forded this stream. Rocks stood above the water so it was not an issue. We climbed up a half mile after lunch and got to a road. There was a bench and a tremendous view of a large lake and the mountains around it. We took a sort break and enjoyed then seat and view before pushing up the rest of the mountain. Around 2:00 we came to a lake with a sandy beach. It was hot and we went swimming. The water was a little cool but it felt great to soak for a while. The beach stayed pretty shallow for a long ways out and the water was crystal clear. We went .3 miles to the shelter where we were going to decide to stay or press on. There were about a dozen girls there from Québec speaking French and we decided to press on after a quick snack. It wasn't too bad of terrain and we were at the campsite by 5:00. This campsite was also on a pond. We ate and enjoyed some conversion. I got my chores done and decided to take a canoe out. Now I don't know this was a good idea after the day I had. The canoes were in bad shape. One was splintered fiberglass sides...that was out. The best looking one had duct tape covering up scrapes on the bottom. I decided on the third. The bottom was dinged up and it looked like someone tried to make a teeter Tooter out of it as both ends were lower than the middle. So I flipped it over, grabbed an orange lifejacket and threw in another 3/4 life jacket that was there, grabbed the paddle that the handle was broken off of and threw in a jug cut open for bailing. I tested it and water didn't pour in so I jumped in and went for it. It was actually a nice little canue trip around the lake. I could have gotten a nice sun set but I didn't trust it enough to take my camera. It was an awesome way to end the day. Even though things don't always go your way...I am blessed beyond belief to be hiking the AT.","Bemis Mountain Lean-to

It was too hot earlier to close it up. It didn't rain long and it was kind of on again off again type of rain. I got a picture of a great sun rise and was on the trail around 6:30. I stuck with Subman, Suds and Rabbit. We had five miles to do and then were going to be picked up by the people from the hostel. We made it to the road after two hours and were picked up soon after. We went to the hostel to check in and went to Moosley Beagles and Ice Cream for breakfast. We sat outside lake front and watched planes takeoff and land on the lake. There was a pretty good crosswind and they were going sideways as soon as they were airborne. I had two eggs and a beagle with cream cheese and a stacknof two pancakes. The pancakes were huge and it took everything I had to get them down. We went back to the hostel to shower and get laundrh done. Rabbits wife(Beth) met us there. She was great and took us to IGA for resupply and to the outfitter to get a few things. She made several trips because there were five hikers and only room in the car for three. She also brought fresh fruit and shared with all of us. After the outfitters I was done early so I went around the corner and got a hotdog and a shake. The girl asked if I wanted the shake now or with the hotdog and I elected to get it now...how long can a hotdog take? Well they are made to order and they cook them and it took a good 10 minutes after I got my shake. I went back to the outfitter and Rabbit and Beth decided to go get a hotdog too. They were also amazed at the time it took to cook a hotdog. Subman was the last to show up and order a hotdog. After a short wait he told them to put it in the microwave. It must have worked because he got his quicker. We went back to the hostel and I got my much delayed journal entry's posted. Subman, Hoosier, Forest and I played a game of horse shoes. The pits were not the best and the game lasted a good while. Everyone decided to get food at IGA and eat at the hostel so a few of us went back for food. I got hamburger, buns, chips, salsa and cookies. Hoosier, Forest and I grilled hamburgers while the others got a chicken from the deli. I made a few phone calls and headed to bed. This is a great group of people I enjoy hanging out with. Everyone does their own thing and not sure where or who I will be with tomorrow.

The fan was loud and kind of kept you from hearing other noises in the house. I set my alarm for the first time on this trip because it was very dark with the lights out and I didn't want to miss the 7:30 shuttle back to the trail. The rest of the hiking crew was leaving at 6:30 but I am in no hurry to get out of a hostel. I didn't end up on the trail until 8:00 but that was no problem. A front had moved through and it was nice a cool with low humidity...it really felt great. I was heading up Saddleback Mountain. It was a 2500 ft climb and it is above treeline. It seemed I stopped and talked to quite a few hikers, thru/section/day. I stopped at the top and talked to a couple who had a cabin in the area. They were interested in my journey. It got very chilly between the temperature and the wind while I was standing there talking. I was hoping the sun would come out. Not long after it did and it made it very warm. I seen a few hikers and it reminded me their is suppose to be a guy out trying to beat the fastest time to complete the AT. Two runners ran by and at the topnof the mountain I asked a few people if they knew anything about it and they didn't. I ran into a young section hiker that was in the Air Force. He noticed my hat and we chatted for a while. Going down the mountain I ran into another runner...I asked if he knew anything someone trying to beat the record. He raised his hand and said it was him. Last year a guy did it in under 48 days beating the woman that had held the record by three hours. He asked my trail name and he continued on. I made it to a shelter by 2:30 and stopped for lunch and ended up taking a 10 min nap. I pressed on and was at the campsite by 4:30. I stopped sort to fill up with water and it started to rain. It was light but got a little heavier before stopping after 10 or 15 minutes. Subman, Suds and Rabbit were already there. I did my chores and ate and was in bed by 7:00. I didn't get a ton of miles in...but that's okay. I believe the terrain gets a little easier in the next couple of days. It was great hiking weather and had beautiful scenic views numerous times through out the day. I have a little over 200 miles left and I will be ready to be done but I will miss it all then same.

They were doing less mes than I so I took a break with them and then headed on. They were going to gonto town tomorrow and I'm going to keep hiking. I had some elevation to climb but the terrain wasn't too bad. That can make a big difference if you are doing one mile a hour or two. I made good time and stopped for lunch around 1:00. At that point I had two climbs in the next two miles and then it was all down hill after that. I hit two milestones...the first going under 200 miles left to go and the second was going over the 2000 mile mark. For some reason my stomach was a liite upset during the afternoon. I took a break and it seemed to help. I made it to the road to Sutton just after 5:00. I didn't plan to go in but being as early as it was I decided to celebrate the 2000 mark with a cheese burger. If I couldn't get a ride by 5:20 I was going to press on and eat my Romane noodles. Not a lot of traffic and the first few cars passed me by. Right at 5:20 a pickup pulled over and took me to the White Wolf restaurant. I charged my phone and got the biggest burger they had. It had bacon and a sausage patty on it to boot. I recognized another hiker as he was leaving. I didn't catch him but asked the guy who he was sitting with his name. His name was Slug and when my sisters picked me up in Great Barrington we met him getting trail magic. We tried to remember his name but couldn't. I finished eating and had strawberry/rhubarb crisp with ice cream for desert. I wanted to get back to the trail and get 1.8 miles to the next campsite. I walked down the road and put my thumb up and a guy going the other direction turned around and gave me a ride back to the trail. He said he was the chief of police in the next town up. I was back on trail and made it to camp by 7:30. I caught up with Slug and reminded him of when we met. He remembered... he was talking to an investor when I first met him. We took a quick photo and got tents set up and bear bags hung before dark. It was great hiking weather ...not too hot. Even with the stop in town I managed to get over 20 miles in. I messaged Marathon and Patch to see how they were doing. I hiked with both of them and they have both completed the trail and getting back to life after the trail.

I woke up once for a short while and slept past when I have been getting up. I made it on the trail around 7:30. Today I was going to conquer the Bigelow Mountains. It started with a 2400 ft climb and then up and down for most of the day until the last 5 miles were down hill. In was above treeline several times for those breathtaking 360 degree views. I got my first look at Katahdin (the end of the AT). It is pretty amazing...I can be on a fire tower and 20 miles later I can barely make it out. Katahdin is still 170 miles away and I can see it. I hiked with Slug for a little while in the morning. He brought up Spirit of 76, seems they have the same birthday. I think he said it was the same as my ex wife's...lol Slug and Spirit met on that day and celebrated together. He hasn't seen her in a while but I think we are within a day of her. The last five miles were down hill and I made pretty good time. For some reason my stomach cramped up on me again this afternoon...I'm not sure if it is the water or what. I was getting close to the lean-to when I notice a bright colored shirt. A lady was sitting on the ground taking a break. She told me she fell and was okay but decided it was time for a break. She bumped her head and she asked me if it was bleeding. It wasn't but scraped up a little. I helped her to her feet and she asked if I would go first and get her to the lean-to. She said she would be nervous to lead and wanted me to. We talked and she seemed to be okay. She was older and I would bavento guess in her 60s. We got to the lean-to and and no one else was there. So I stayed and talked for a while and then a group of guys in their mid teens came in to camp. She went to set up her camp and I continued to the next campsite that was on a large lake. I met a guy heading southbound and he told me there was trail magic a mile up trail at the road. His name was Spotted Kiwi and he was from New Zealand. Be hiked from GA to NY a different year and got lyme disease. Be came back to finish up and was heading southbound this time. I got to the trail magic and had a fresh peach, trail mix and some power bars. The power bars were home made and had the ingredients on the container...they really bit the spot. I took a picture of the ingredients to hopefully someday find the recipe. I made it to a tent site at 6:30. Not exactly sure it is the one listed in the guide book but it is nice and just off the lake. Made dinner and enjoyed the sunset. Another hiker came in later. Tomorrow I am limited on miles. I have to cross the Kennebec river and they have a boat that ferry's hikers because it is too dangerous to ford. It only operates from 9-2 so you have to time it out right.

The lean-to in five miles says swimming so I will stop there for a nice long break. All day the terrain is nice and then it gets some root and rock areas then goes back smooth. I would make somd good distance today if it wasn't for the ferry stopping so early. Just small rises and descents. It was warm and humid this early in the morning. I get to one area and the gnats are horrible...swarming me. So for the second time on this trip I put on my bug head net. It works great and the little suckers leave me alone after that. I make to the first shelter a little after 9:00 and take my shoes off, eat and head down to the water. There is a couple there with a dog that doesn't like to share his space. I stick my hand out for him to sniff and the lady says maybe you should do that...lol. So I head out to the water where it is rocky. I go slow because some of the rocks are very slick. Another young couple come down to get water, they were out swimming yesterday. The water temperature was very comfortable. Not long after that a leach hits my leg...I swat it off immediately and head back to shore and sit on a rock. Eventually I put my feet back in to soak for a bit. I get back on trail at 11:00 and eat much around noon. A few miles down the trail I am back hiking beside a lake and out of nowhere I hit a sandy beach. One girl is enjoying it and I stop and take a dip too. It is one of the warmer days we have had in a while and it is refreshing. The water refreshed me and I was feeling good hiking the rest of the day. I arrived at Pierce Pond Lean-to before 4:30. I could get water at the lake but they have signs to water so maybe there is a nice spring. I follow it and it leads me to a dried up brook, well at least no water is flowing. So back up to the lake I go, I'm going over some roots and my crock shoe catches a little root sticking outnof the main root. I keep lifting my leg but its not giving so down I go hard on my knee. It hurts pretty good and it is skinned up. I think thats about the hardest fall I've taken...usually it is backwards onto my pack. I get up and it is tender at first but I am able to walk it off. I had lifted my leg so hard I tore my crock. I don't think it is going to be an issue but it is amazing how fast things can change. I ate dinner and found Old Fox. We discussed our timelines for getting to Katahdin. We should be there and summit either the same day or a day apart. We both have people meeting us so we are trying get a good date to meet them.

I had less than 4 miles to go to get to the ferry that crosses the Kennebec river. It is a wide river and the only one that has a ferry. There is a dam and when they open it can cause under currents and the water can raise 4 ft rapidly so they want hikers to use the ferry service. I and other hikers can feel this journey coming to an end and I feel like I spend time remembering things on my travels. I made it to the ferry crossing 30 minutes before they started and found Lucky Dog there. I had met him a few days earlier and we had a nice conversation. Shortly after Slug showed up and soon after that the ferry(canoe) was heading our way with hikers from the other side. They arrived and we had to sign a waiver before putting on lifejackets and heading to the other side. The drought has been tough up here and the guy in charge of the ferry said its the lowest he has ever seen the river. Lucky Dog and I are the first to cross. On the other side I started down the trail and decide to go get a photo of the ferry crossing. By that time Slug was in the boat and I get a picture of him coming over. After that it is a few 100 yards to the road where the Caratunk Bed and Breakfast is and they have burgers, shakes and a good resupply. I order a burger and a chocolate shake and pick up a days resupply. The shakes are made in the old aluminium cups and they give you a Dixie cup to pour it as you go. Slug and I enjoy our food out at a shaded table on the lawn when Old Fox showed up. This is how things work on the trail...Old Fox almost had me convinced to spend the night in the town of Caratunk. Today he was with me and ready to press on a few more miles. He ordered his shake and burger and we all charged our electronics. They had WiFi so we got a little internet time in also. About noon, Old Fox and I ordered another burger, I had another shake too. Not long after Old Fox ordered his second shake. While we were there a older gentleman who worked there says that's it...you sound like Bill Clinton...speaking to me. I have never heard that before. I'm from Ohio but lived in Arkansas for 14 years and most people notice my southern draw. Then he told me to say ""I have not had sex with that woman"". We all had a good laugh about it. Another guy showed up and was sitting on the porch and giving everyone a hard time in a fun way. I asked if they recycled and he told me to throw my can as far as I could into the woods because these people needed more work to do. As he was leaving the older gentleman that worked there told me he was a retired state senator who got the river cleaned up. You just never know who you are going to meet. Another hiker showed up and his name was Brother Raccoon. It turned out he had a Raccoon one piece costume that he wore as his long johns. You have to be prepared for cold weather in the Whites. They talked him into putting it on and we all took pics of him. After 3.5 hours of hanging out it was back to the trail for us. It was a pretty easy six miles but it was too far to go to the shelter after that. So I got there about 3:30 and waited for Old Fox. I was going to press on and stealth camp if he was up for it. He arrived hot and tired and said he was done for the day. Once again there was a lake nearby so down we went .2 miles for a swim. The beach was rocky so I wore my crocks in. The water was cool and refreshing. Afterwards it was time to set up camp and eat before retiring for the day. The plan for the now is to do a big 20 miles tomorrow, do a nearo 10 miles into Monson on Saturday and stay at a hostel. Sunday start the 100 mile wilderness and come out of it on Friday. Saturday I will hike 10 miles to a campsite just below Katahdin. Depending on the weather... Summit Katahdin on Sunday or Monday. I am going to miss this trail but I'm not going to miss the camp food(Knorr pasta/rice sides, Ramon noodles, peanut butter, tuna, instant mashed potato's, summer sausage). That and snack foods are pretty much what we survive on. Lots of breakfast bars, cliff bars, Snickers, Paydays, trail mix, tortillas, potato chips.

I ended up chatting with the others and didn't get on the trail until 7:00. Old Fox and I planned a 22 mile hike. We had a 1000 ft climb and a 1300 ft climb and the rest of the day was a gradual down hill. I left out before him and ran into a SOBO early heading south so I didn't have to clear out too many spider webs. Rumor on the trail was there was no water at the next shelter so get some at the pond before heading on. When I got to the pond it started raining again. I headed to the shelter and had 9 miles in just after 11:00. As I ate lunch in the shelter the rain came down heavier but slowed down before I left and had stopped within the next 30 minutes. I headed up Moxie Bald and chatted with a coiplenof hikers at the top. There are also wild blueberries on the top so I stopped and enjoyed a bunch of those. The caren's(piles of rocks) led me to the summit but then I couldn't find anymore. The fog had moved in by this time. I looked all around for the trail but was unable to find it. Finally I went back a couple of carens and picked up the trail from there. I headed on and questioned if I was going the right way...things seemed to look familiar. I passed a guy heading southbound and after talking with him knew for sure I was on the right track. I was halfway done for the day and stopped at the shelter down the mountain for a quick snack. Old Fox joined me. We still had 9 miles to go and it was 3:00. They were suppose to be easy miles and off we went. At first we ran into wet rocks that slowed us down but they finally disappeared and we had a nice trail to make good miles. We did those 9 miles in about 3.5 hours and made it to camp by 6:30. Severe storms are in the forecast so it is in the lean-to for the night. Seven hikers are in the lean-to so it is full. One southbound hiker asked if I was ready for this trip to be over. I said not really and he said everyone else he asked this question to was, they were ready to be done. I have enjoyed just slowing down and the time with the other hikers during the last month.

Old Fox was still sleeping when I left. One thing I hadn't done was wear these shoes in rain, and the back of my heels were tender from yesterday. I didn't notice until I started hiking and I thought about going back to the shelter to out moleskin on them but pressed on. The soreness seemed to get less painful as I hiked. About an hour in I crossed a stream that I was suppose to ford but with the lack of rain I was able to hop across the rocks. I ran into Slug who had stealth camped in his hammock and talked to him a few. Spirit of 76 and Iraqnia had passed him a half hour before me. I continued on, the trail was pretty easy other than some slippery rocks and roots here and there. I planned to do 9 miles but there was a shorter way into town at 5.7 miles so I took that. Monson is the last trail town so I planned to nearo and start the 100 mile wilderness on Sunday. I got to the hostel and it was crowded...lucky I didn't arrive an night earlier or I wouldn't have had a place to stay. I got checked in and a shower and was getting ready to go eat when Spirit and Iraqnia showed up...so we went out to eat. My employer had called a few days earlier to ask when I would be returning so I returned that call. Time off is dwindling down and I requested Sept 1 as my date to return. I will work a couple of days and have a weekend....that way I can ease my way back into things. I did notice a flyer on the hostels refrigerator door looking for trail maintainers here in Maine. But you have to have a good attitude.. .so that rules me out . So after lunch I went to the AT visitors center and registered and got some questions answered about Baxter State Park and Mt Katahdin. They are pretty strict about that area and try to protect it from over use. Then I came back to hostel to do laundry. I went and did some resupply and stopped by the hostel to talk to Spirit and was pleasantly surprised to find Rabbit and Beth there. It seems he pushed to get here and Subman and Suds are just a few hours behind. The four of them all started in GA on the same day and would like to finish together. The plan is to finish on Monday the 22, the same day as I planned to summit. We will see if it all holds together but that would be cool to summit on the same day as these folks. I brought my resupply back to the hostel and packed it up. All of us had dinner together to include Iraqunia and another hiker. It was an enjoyable evening. The locals are happy to see the rain, it has been really dry up here. I'm not sure how many miles I will get in tomorrow but I'm going to be hitting some big mile days after that. It was another great day to be a hiker","Horseshoe Canon Lean-to

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545774,"I got a good nights sleep and woke up early, I decided to do 3.7 miles today and come back to the hostel so I could around these the hikers I'm now with. I was 3 miles behind them because I took a shortcut into town and they all continued to the road and got shuttled into town. The hostel makes a good breakfast so I was here for that. It was raining during the night and the early part of the morning. Iraqnia had a facebook friend that she had met a few times that lived in the area and whos father lived across the street. She asked Iraqnia to be her maid of honor so she could get married at Shaws Hostel today. She came with a few people and her father married them and 20 some hikers attended. It was actually a nice ceremony. The second wedding I've attended in a month...lol. After that I went and hiked my 3.7 miles and caught up with Lucky Dog. He hikes a little slower than I but I was in no big hurry and stayed with him and chatted. We seen the first sign of fall as nice size area of brown leaves were on the ground. Right as we were getting to the road he was walking down a rocky area and slipped and went down hard. He made it up and was okay. We got a shuttle back to the hostel. I cleaned up and went to lunch and was joined by another section hiker and later Rabbit and Beth joined us. It was a barbeque joint sold out barbeque sandwiches so I settled for a cheese burger. Later I went and got somemore information on climbing Katahdin and reserved a parking space for Sun and Mon. I made some final arraignments with my sister who is joining me at the end. I relaxed a little and then went down and enjoyed a trio playing 70s music at the Lakeside Hostel where Spirit, Rabbit, Subman and Suds were staying. I met a guy they had been hiking with Blues Brother. We were having dinner there and I saw Hoosier walk past the window. A couple of us ran out to get him and Forrest who was not far behind him. They joined us for dinner. What a great group of people to finish this thing with. Tomorrow the rain is supposed to be gone and we start the 100 mile wilderness. There is one place you have an opportunity for a resupply but other than that it is pretty much isolated. One more week and 115 miles will bring this journey to an end. I'm just trying to soak it all in at this point. I had an enjoyable hike and looking forward to a few more","Monson ME (Shaws Hostel)

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546059,"I slept well and was up early. I went down to the gas station and got breakfast and money from the ATM then back to Shaws Hostel. The crew was meeting for breakfast and Rabbits wife was going to shuttle us back to the trail. I visited with Forest and Hoosier before she came. Today was the start of the 100 mile wilderness where there is very little support. My pack was heavy because I had six days of food...the most I have ever carried. We were on the trail by 7:30. Subman, Suds and Spirit were 15 minutes ahead of us and Rabbit, Blues Brother and I hiked together. We passed the couple that got married yesterday at the hostel and I introduced Rabbit to them. As we got to the first shelter the trail got less obvious. Subman told us we had to go down challenging rocky path while a much easier path was available. All I can say about that is....watch out for paybacks. At this point the 100 mile wilderness isn't much different than the rest of the trail we have hiked...a little easier as we had less intense climbs and descents. First thing in the morning rocks were wet and slick. Blues Brother who was leading said ""watch out this rock is slick"" soon I was on my butt and Rabbit went down shortly after. No one was hurt other than our egos. We were a little more cautious after that. We came to a very beautiful area with the green moss on the ground and the trees all around. Tried to take a picture but I don't think you can capture the way it presented itself as we hiked through. Later we passed a cool waterfall, a thin coorador dropping onto the boulders below. Early afternoon we crossed Little Wilson stream and not far from that was Big Wilson. We looked for a way to rock hop it but found we were going to have to ford our first waterway of the trip. So off with the shoes and socks on went the crocks. Blues and I arrived before Rabbit and were ready to cross by the time Rabbit shows up. Rabbit had no camp shoes and was determined to rock hope the stream. So across Blues and I went as Rabbit worked his way down stream to find rocks to step on. He ended up down stream quite a ways and finally got to a place he had to step into the water to get across. Now let me tell you this,,Rabbit is am""purist"" when it comes to hiking the trail. If he misses a blaze he will go back to take the correct path. Well he went far enough down stream that we told him he was off trail and didn't hike the intended route. Another hiker came by and added to our assult of informing Rabbit he did not hike the intended trail and he was no longer a ""thru"" hiker but a long 200 mil ""section"" hiker and now preparing to hike another section. Now if Rabbit would have been smart he would have went back and hiked the intended path because we made comments the rest of the day about him being a ""section hiker"" and I'm sure these little digs will continue all the way to the end...lol So at the end of the day we come to a sign that says ""trail magic 1/8 mile down dirt road"". So down the dirt road we go to a hunters cabin. There we find a grill going with burger and hot dogs. It seems this guy lost his son and does this for hikers in memory of his son. It is an awesome way to end the day. He also has fruit, soda and beer. So we stay and chat for awhile. He tells us there are some good campsites just past the next stream. We spend a half an hour there before heading down to the stream to set up camp. Subman and Suds are already there and Rabbit, Blues Brother and I join them. Spirit and Iraqnia have headed to the Lean-to, 3 miles further north. The weather was great...low humidity with temps in the 70s. It was a great day to hike.","Monson ME (Shaws Hostel) +3.7

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546060,"Went to sleep early....woke up after a couple if hours to write yesterdays journal. I was up and on the trail at 6:30, Rabbit, Subman and Suds were already 20 minutes ahead of me. I yelled into Blues Brother that I was leaving, he was still sleeping. I caught up with the others after an hour on the trail and went ahead after the first break we took. I was wanting to get over 20 miles in today and the other three were looking at 15 miles. Not long after that I caught up with Spirit of 76 and Iraqnia. So I hiked with them awhile until we took a brake at a mountain top. By then then three others had caught up. The rest of the afternoon Subman and I kept leapfrogging each other. I passed one guy who had to be the tallest person I have seen out here and asked him his height. He was 7'1"", one of the tallest people I have ever seen...I passed Ralph Sampson in an airport once. We had to ford our second river of this trip, that is where I lost the others. They stayed on the other side and camped. As I was putting my shoes back on a guy stopped on the other side and asked if anyone would like a Coke. He had four and Rabbit, Subman, and Suds were on the other side. They said yes and called over to me to ask if I wanted one. Suds was in her Crocks and said I will bring it to you. So I said sure,,and she brought me one. I twist the lid to the bottle and it blows up all over and gets my shirt. I still have 3/4 of a bottle and I take my shirt off and rinse it dunk it in the river and ring it out a couple of times. At that time Suds is about halfway across the river and hits a slick rock and goes down. Not completely but gets half her shorts wet and part of her shirt too. I feel so bad since she was doing me a favor. At least they were getting ready to camp and she could get some other clothes on and dry those out some. I said good bye thanked Suds for her kindness and pressed on. I had over five miles to go and it was after 4:30. The trail started out fast and I was flying it was a slight uphill but it was still fast. It got a little more rooty and rocky as I went but nothing bad. I passed Not Chris and he was looking for a stealth tent sight. They had a restoration project going on and didn't want anyone camping within two miles of where we forded the river. He not quite out of the two miles when he found a great ace to set up his tent. He told me if I found a better place not too far ahead to yell back at him. So I went on and did find one, yelled back but not sure if he heard me or not as I was close to a water fall. I catch up with a hiker named Squirrel. We are getting close to the Lean-to and she has had a long day. I hike about five minutes with her and we get to a stream just before the lean-to and fill up our bottles. We get to the lean-to and no one has claimed any spots yet and rain is in the forecast so we both claim a spot by throwing our sleeping mats out. Two other girls come and take spots and not long after that a couple claim the last two. I go to make dinner and for the 100 mile wilderness I bought Mountain House dinners. They are expensive but have meat in them and a lot more calories. You boil water throw it in the bag and they cook inside the bag for 15 minutes. I go to get my spoon and it is not there. After the last town I started putting it in a new location because I was keeping it in my food bag and I was getting holes and in bags the food was actually stored in. So changing things gets you out of habits and I must have left the spoon at the last camp site. I double check my back pack and food bags and it is not there. I put my hand down where my water bladder is suppose to go in my pack(I don't put the bladder in there) and find my foot powder bottle lid came off and foot powder all over in there. Itnis only in that area and not all over in the pack though. So dinner is at hand... I have a bag of spaghetti and no spoon. I ask around and no one has an extra. So I look around and see my Coke bottle. I cut down the side to the center of the bottom and do the same about 1/8 of the way around the bottle to make a spoon. It actually worked quite well. I even avoided cutting myself in the process. So as I am eating the mice start running around the shelter. I don't like the sound of that and decide to set the tent up. It is getting close to 8:00 and getting dark, so I get the tent up, bear bag hung. Throw my pack in the tent and remember the foot powder. I take everything out of the pack so I can take it outside and just shake it upside down. As I am shaking it my camp spoon falls out . I wipe down my wetones and ziplock bags I keep in the same compartment as the powder was in and wipe the rest of the bag down. I repack the things I won't need and am ready for bed. I am 35 miles into the 100 mile wilderness and it hasn't been bad. Kind of a roller coaster of ups and downs today but once we hit the 50 mile mark it levels out until we hit Katahdin. I went over the 2100 mile mark today, 2189.2 is the finish mark. I got in over 20 today and probably my toughest day left. It was a beautiful day to hike","Long Pond Stream (Stealth)

"NeRF66. ""Stripe'",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546061,"We had some pretty good rainfall overnight and the wind made it more interesting. I didn't get wet but each side of my tent had a little water. So I wiped it up and went back to sleep. I stayed dry but everything was a little damp in the morning. I got up at 5:45 and should have been on the trail by 6:30 but drying everything off I didn't make it to the trail until 7:15. My foodbag had been raided again and they got some chips. That is two nights in a row now...the first night they just got in the trash. I had four hills today and then the rest of the terrain is flat until I get to Katahdin. During the morning I ran I to some section hikers. They said they were getting off.trail and wondered if I would like some chocolate chips. I said sure and they gave me a big bag of chocolate chips. I was hiking a while and heard voices...one sounded like Slug. I turned the corner and sure enough there he was talking to some people hiking southbound. We hiked together most of the day. We got up then second mountain(Whircap) and it was above treeline. The wind was blowing and it was cloudy with a heavy mist. I wish I had my contacts in because my glasses were littered with drops of water and it was hard to see where on the rocky surface I was stepping. I tried to dry them with my tec shirt but that only does so much. It was very chilly conditions...thankfully it didn't last too long before we were back under treeline. On a clear day you can see Katahdin from there. We went another mile and a half down and made it to a shelter for a snack. I put my raincoat on for warmth and took my shoes off to let my feet air/dry out. There are a lot of hikers in the area and at least a dozen moved in and out of the lean-to while I was there. Slug and I hiked together most of the day, I enjoy his company. Mid afternoon the sun came out and it was a nice afternoon. We had one more 600 ft climb and then the terrain would be flat until Katahdin. On top of that moutian Slug made a phone call and I continued to the lean-to and made it in by 5:30. I was exhausted from the last two days of 20 milers. Patriot came in a little later and said Rabbit, Blues Brother, Subman and Suds were not far behind. Sure enough they were there within an hour. I was shocked but happy to see them again. I couldn't believe they did 25 miles. They are heading to the only hostel in the 100 mile wilderness and didn't want to do 22 miles into it. I will continue on as I have a Saturday deadline to meet my sister who is picking me up. The forecast is nice for the next few days until a major storm is forecasted for Monday. We will see what happens and schedule my Katahdin summit accordingly. This 100 mile wilderness is pretty much the same as the trail I've been hiking the last six months, only a little more secluded. We still see other hikers out for short excursions, just few paved roads and no close towns. I figured the forest would be thicker but its not. Looking at the elevation profile it is a straight line to Katahdin and then a major rise to over 5000 ft. It was a damp cool morning with a sunny comfortable afternoon for a wonderful day to hike. I don't know how many times on the trail I have heard...you are the most upbeat hiker I've seen. I am enjoying life even when things are not going my way.

They hit me the last two nights getting into my trash and potato chips. I was on the trail around 6:30 and Subman, Suds and Rabbit already had a thirty minute head start on me. A pretty gentle slope today and hit some rock and roots areas but nothing too bad. I decided I missed the uphill climbs. I played leap frog with a couple of girls that had stayed at the same lean-to s the last couple nights. I asked their names but no longer remember. I saw guy named Flipper heading south. I asked what was up and he said he wasn't feeling well and had someone coming to shuttle him to town. He has came from Georgia so he must have been feeling real bad not to push on with under 50 miles to go. I hiked alone all day and didn't see any familiar faces. I met a girl named Purples, I have heard hikers talk of her but this is the first I met her and she started the beginning of March. I stopped at several lakes and rivers to take a breather and recharge on some food. One area I even had internet so I updated my journal and put a couple of pics on Facebook. I got to one area I could see Katahdin, there was a cloud hanging over it but I was able to seen the base of it. The mosquitoes were bad and I put on some Off for the third time on this trip. They were biting me while I was hiking , they have never done that before. I'm not sure when it has happened but I have quite few bites on me. An afternoon shower popped up when I was sittiting by the river on one of my breaks. A pretty good down pour but it didn't last long. I got to a sandy beach about .5 miles from the lean-to and decided to rinse off and just go ahead and camp close by. I got 21 miles in for today and that will leave 20 miles to get to where I want to get tomorrow. Secret Agent and Stitch were hanging out on the beach too so I chatted with them a while.

I was on the trail around 7:00 and made it to the next lean-to a half mile away where I seen Purples. She was with her dad and carrying the hubcap that has been carried by numerous hikers all the way up the trail. Last I seen it, it was in Damascus. Well I seen it there and one other time more north. It has already been on the Pacific Crest Trail. Not long after that Slug showed up. We hiked together most of the day and stopped at the last lean-to in the 100 mile wilderness. There were some awesome views of Katahdin today. We went to one cliff that went straight down, it was a skinney corridor with a stream far below. Another over look was above a lake. I seen something in the middle of the lake floating and jokingly asked if that was a moose. We laughed because we want to see a moose so bad. We decided it was a moose and he was doing the backstroke. We joked about that all day. We got to a place we needed to rock hop across a stream...we got to the other side to find we didn't need to cross it. So we headed back to the side we started on Slug made it with no problem. I jumped to the next rock and tried to keep my momentum from overshooting the rock and drug my back foot into the water. I was happy that was all that got wet. The journey is soo close to being over. What an adventure it has been. Tomorrow I hike 13 miles to meet my sister and Sunday I plan to summit Katahdin. I shooting for Monday when there would be a smaller crowd but the weather is suppose to be nice Sunday and rainy on Monday.

After doing it so long it is hard to believe this journey will soon be over. I joked with Slug I could just leave it all there because I no longer needed any of it. I was on the trail by 6:30 and hiking with Slug. We took off at a fast pace but it slowed as we went. After three miles we were out of the 100 mile wilderness and at Abol Bridge where there was a camp store and a restaurant. I had the a you could eat breakfast...reminded me of what you get at hotel breakfast. So I ate a lot and visited with Stitch, Secret Agent, Hair Ball and Sweat Ball. We were there about an hour and a half and moved on to sign into Baxter State Park. There was a park employee there and he answered questions we had and told us there was a river that we would have to ford and it was waist deep. I had 10 miles until Katahdin Stream Campground where I would meet my sister who is picking me up at the end. Communication is difficult so it is easier to meet her so we can discuss when we were going to summit Katahdin. We hiked by a river and there were about 20 rafts full of people going down stream. We turned the corner and they were giving people lessons on how to position themselves if they fell out of the raft to continue down stream. Then loading those folks into rafts. We went a half mile further and were at our first ford of the day. One rock was five foot away from the next closest one. If you could make that jump, the rest of it was easy rock hopping and no ford. Slug got up there and made the jump look easy, I got there and looked for alternative routes and found none. Finally I just went for it and landed safely. Probably the worst thing about missing would be if your pack got wet...including your electronics. So we went another mile and had to cross another...this time the rocks were close together and it was no biggie. We stopped for a break and I washed out my T-shirt that was smelling. Slug decided to get all the way in and clean off. After a while the ranger came by and told me my party had been at the front gate and was waiting for me. I waited a little longer for Slug but decided to head on to the campground where I would meet my sister. I hiked fast and past a group of four who said they were from eastern Europe. I asked where and they were all from different countries. I moved on and down the trail I seen my sister and brother in law on the trail walking my way. I tried to hide from them but they had already seen me. So we walked to the parking lot together. We headed out of the park that is about 10 miles at 20 mph. Before we got out a car was stopped in the road with its flashers on. They seen a moose and stopped for pictures, so I did the same. It was standing in a pond and looked back at us a couple of times. We went to the hotel so I could shower and downtown to a local restaurant. I had a lobster sandwich and fries with a beer to wash it down. We stopped at grocery to get a few things then back to the hotel and a swim. It was a great weather day. I planned to summit Katahdin on Monday but the weather looks bad so tomorrow is the big day. My sister and brother in law are going to give it a go too. On the way out of the park we seen Not Chris. We are going to give him a ride in the morning back to the park 20 minutes away.

We had a 30 minute drive to Baxter State Park and got there early to be in the front of the line into the park. Not Chris rode along with us so his parents wouldnt have to drive all that way just to come back to the motel. The gate opened at 6:00 and we made it to the parking lot around 5:30. I stopped by the rangers station and privy. I seen a few thru hikers(Slug, Old Fox, Stitch and Secret Agent). We started up at 7:00 after we signed the register. We had a 4100 foot climb to make in 5.2 miles. It started out pretty easy trail and steadily got a little steeper with more rocks. The first couple of miles went pretty quick. I figured we would come out of treeline but we kept going up and so did the trees. After a mile and a half we saw the Ball Girls (cousins Sweat Ball and Hair Ball) coming down. We asked what time they went up, they left at 4:00 AM so they could see the sunrise. Clouds moved in and they didn't get to see it. The trail continued to get steeper for the fist two miles and then we come out of treeline. At that point we turned around for a spectacular view. Also the boulder scramble started and the climbing over rockes. The first area wasn't so bad but it got pretty tough quick. Janet (who has short legs, she says) was having a little difficulty getting her leg high enough and then the strength to pull herself up at some places. This area was tougher than I expected and slow going. One spot had rebar in the rocks for foot and hand holds. Even with that Janet had a tough time getting up it. After a little time we got her over it. After that, the boulder scramble just kept on going....looking up and seeing all the boulders ahead was a little disheartening. We kept on plugging away and the wind was getting stronger and stronger. I'm not sure how long it took but it was a while. We finally got over the boulder scramble and got to the area called the table top. The trail leveled off and we had two miles to go to hit the summit. Janet was tired from the boulder scramble but kept on pushing forward. It was pretty foggy and the elevation got a little steeper as we got closer to the top. I pushed forward as Janet and David took a break. The people coming down kept telling us we had 20 more minutes. I hit some rock scrambles going up and stopped and waited in the fog. Eventually Davids image appeared and we continued to the summit. There were some Asian ladies at the sign taking some pictures. After a few minutes they stepped aside so David could take my picture standing behind and up on the brace of the sign. David took a few pictures and then asks one of the ladies to take it because his hands were shaky. The temperatures were in the upper 50s with a 40 mile an hour wind hitting us. She took my picture and then each none of them wanted to stand on the signs brace as I did and get there picture taken. David told them that I just completed the whole trail and they were amazed. They wanted me and David to stand in the picture with them. We didn't stay long and headed down. I was worried about Janet and a little about David spending their energy on the way yp and we had 4000 feet to go down yet. We left without a picture of David and now feel bad about it. The Asian ladies do have his picture though. I hiked about 10 minutes and couldn't find Janet. I waited to see Davids image appear in the fog and went on to find Janet. I finally caught her ansd her hair was all wet. I asked how she was and she said, OK. Her hair waa wet from the fog/mist. We waited for David and went back to a trail junction. We could go back down the way we came up or take the Abol campground trail down. The Abol trail was suppose to have switch backs and we elected to take that one. When we got down we were going to have to walk 2 miles back to the car. We got to the edge of the area called the table top and where the boulder scramble began. It was close to 3:00 and we had a long way to go down. The decent was sharp and Janet and David were on their butts a lot scooting to the next boulder below them. The boulder field went down down down and it was a very long process moving down. We were below and had magnificent views. But seeing how small the trees were below reminded us of how far we had to go. Janet made the comment several times that she should not be up here but she is a trooper and continued to push down. We would get a little further down and figure out the least difficult path to continue. There were blue blazes all the way down but you still had to choose the path with the least amount of drop off to the next boulder. It took us a couple of hours to get down this area and finally make it below treeline. The top of the treeline was a little rough but it got easier as we went. At one point I got the car key and went ahead of them. As the terrain leveled out I started a jog and was making good time. My foot caught a rock at one point and down I went. I got up, dusted myself off and headed on. I got to the road around 6:30 and had a 20 minute jog/walk back to the car. Just before the car I stopped by to see who was at the campsite and planned to summit tomorrow. Squirrel, Lucky Dogg and a few others were there. We were suppose to get rain overnight and it was suppose to clear up between 10 and noon and they were hoping to head up then. I gave them some trail magic of snacks Janet and David had in the car. I wished them luck and headed back to pick up Janet and David. They had made it down and they too had each tripped and taken a tumble but were all right. We went back to town and grabbed a pizza and some beer and took back to the hotel. We didn't get back until 9:00. David and I ate the pizza and Janet was too tired to eat...lol. We all were in bed soon after...what an exhausting day. I enjoyed the climb, you will have to ask Janet and David their opinions... Lol. WOW!!!!! I have completed the 2189.1 miles they call the Appalachian Trail. It was a challenge, an adventure, a learning experience, amazing journey.

I was greeted by Subman and Suds and told them about the summit. Janet and David joined me for breakfast. Stitch came in and told me how the trip up Katahdin went for her. After that it was off to the hot tub to join Subman and Suds, David came and joined us. Rabbit stopped by and talked and was heading out to bring Spirit of 76 over to our hotel. Beth came over to visit. I went and packed up so we could leave at the 11:00 checkout. Before it was over we had a crowd of thru hikers and friends sitting around the pool telling stories. The line up was Rabbit, Beth, Janet, Slug, Natalie, Forrest, Forrests friend, Mustard Seed, Subman, Suds, Spirit of 76 and me. Slug and I were the only two that had summited, the rest were waiting for Tuesday when the weather was going to be clear. We had a great time and I am going to miss this group. I broke up the party at 11:00 and we got a picture and hugs and hit the highway. We stopped and picked up some t-shirts and headed out. We went down to the Portland area and stopped to see a former coworker of mine. We stopped at Old Orchard Beach to visit and have dinner. My friend, Kirby, took us to the beach and then we went out for seafood. It turned out to be great side trip on the way home. It is good to see old friends. We drove a couple of more hours and stopped for the night.","Katahdin Summit
