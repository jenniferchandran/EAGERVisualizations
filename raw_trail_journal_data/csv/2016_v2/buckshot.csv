West Prong, Middle Prong, Road Prong and so on. I guess that was the vocabulary 80 years ago. LOL.Every day, Donna Marr took me on more and more exhaustive hikes. Some with added length, some with added elevation. Some with both. I learned to identify several plants and flowers. We did see deer and turkeys, but no bear. In Cataloochee; we had hoped to see the Elk, but they were elusive.My final big day was hiking the A.T. from Clingmans Dome (The highest point on the entire trail) to Newfound Gap. This was only eight miles of the A.T.; but quite strenuous. It took me 5 hours to walk it. All but about 50 yards; was either UP or DOWN. Thanks to the trekking poles, I still have 2 knees.I learned a few things about my gear, my physical shape and my mentality. I must shave of more weight from my pack. I started with around 35 - 40 pounds. After the first day; I took out everything that was not needed as I was only doing day hikes. ( clothes, food, stove ). My pack weighed only 22 pounds the rest of the week. What a difference. I could do this all day, for several days.My physical well being, is that I think I can do this. Although, I will wait until my starting date next March / April; I will continue strengthening my back and legs. Also; vitamin T and A helped a lot. (Tylenol and Advil). I also met a couple from Maryland, who were hiking the same section of the A.T.(Woofie and Wooly Booly). Such a great couple. Since I left my truck at Newfound Gap, I gave them a ride down to Gatlinburg. So I turned from hiker, to trail Angel all in one afternoon. Cool.Will post more later","Learning the hard way

buckshot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521033,"So here are a few things I've learned, while preparing for my thru hike:1.) Learn from other peoples mistakes. The old adage of ""learn from your mistakes"" is crazy. It's far better to learn from someone else making mistakes.2.) You're never really fully prepared. Read every thing. Watch every video clip. Tie every knot, try out every trick but when day one comes; it'll be like ""DANG IT"" I forgot to do xx.3.) You buy way too much gear, only to take most of it out and leave it home in order to lighten the load.4.) Spend the money. I probably have spent as much money on gear I thought I wanted or needed, but ended up buying something else. Just go ahead and spend the extra money, and get the good stuff.5.) Cat litter is a great substitute. I don't have cats, but I bought a couple of 10 lb bags of cheap cat-litter; and put them in my backpack while I hike here at home. It helps train my back and legs to have 20+ lbs extra. When I'm through, I can pour the litter in the garden, or donate to the shelter.6.) Every one (Except Mom) (See previous post) is excited and supportive of my hike. However; NO-ONE want to do it with me.7.) Why? Is the most common question; and I'll post my reason, just before I go.8.) My question is....If the mice are so bad at the shelters, why isn't something done. Many hikers get sick from the mice. The Bears were a problem, so they created the Bear cables. So if mice are a problem and a big concern, do something.9.) Planning is harder than the training. Where to send drop boxes. When to re-supply. Do I need 5 days of food or 6, to get me to the next town. Do I want maps, or just the AT Guide and GutHook. But the planning is fun too.10.) And back to #1.

If I finish; fantastic. If I make it to the next shelter, fantastic. I'm not expecting a cake; nor am I expecting my previous supervision to call me and congratulate me. It's all on me. Whatever I can do, I'll do. But I do like the quote above....""If you have to think anyway; why not think big"".Buckshot","Still learning

buckshot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522876,"When talking of my up coming hike; everyone have so many questions. I like to talk about my trip; just like someone going on a cruise to Alaska, or a Trip to China or to see the Grand Canyon. It consumes your thoughts. So I'll try to list the questions....and the answer I think they want to hear:ARE YOU CARRYING A GUN? Yep; a 45 caliber (the most powerful handgun in the world, powerful enough to blow your head clean off your shoulders. Do you feel lucky? Well? Do ya; Punk?)No I am not carrying a gun. I do however, have Pepper Spray Gel. I don't expect anyone to mess with me; (6'3"" 245lbs), but I'm not chancing it eitherWHAT ABOUT BEARS? Yeah, they have a healthy appetite for humans, and have been known for chasing you off cliffs, trying to get at your intestines.Bears live where I'm going, so it wouldn't surprise me if I see one or twelve. I am an avid hunter and outdoorsman. I respect them and understand my role in the woods.IS YOUR WIFE GOING? Yep; in fact she's carrying her own gear. She likes snakes, mice, spiders, skunks and going #2 in the woods. So proud!!No, she is not. As much as I will miss her; and hope to see her visit me up the trail in town someplace, I know she would be uncomfortable and I wouldn't want her to be in that environment.WHERE WILL YOU SLEEP? In a resort hotel every night, with room service, a swimming pool, and cable TV, and WIFI.Ummmmm; in the woods. I have a tent, sleeping bag, warm clothes, and food. I'll have to get my water from streams and filter all of it. And yes, I'll be carrying it all on my back.WHAT IF YOU HURT YOURSELF OR TWIST AN ANKLE? I watched several videos on how to slice my arm to suck out poison from snake bites and how to amputate legs. There are inherited risks on the trail; including tick bites, snake bites, falls, cuts, bruises, and yes broken bones. First rule is safety. Then First Aid. Keeping calm and using my head. If I am incapacitated, and can't help myself much; there are many hikers on the trail at any given time and I may also be one who needs to help someone else.WHAT WILL YOU EAT? Grubs, roots, pine needles, flower petals, wild brook trout, squirrels, and if needed, another hiker.I will carry about 2 lbs of food for each day. Mountain House meals (Kinda like MRE's) Ramen noodles, Peanut Butter, pouch tuna, pouch Spam, trail bars, candy bars, Oatmeal, Poptarts, etc.HOW WILL YOU GET THE FOOD? 7-11 and Circle K have small convenience stores right on the trail, about every 3-4 miles. No gas, just food.Really; there are road crossings about every 3, 4, or 5 days of hiking. So I only have to carry enough for that many days. I'd go into small trail towns and re-supply my needs. Martha will also be sending me supply boxes.WHAT ARE SUPPLY BOXES? Extra tents, shovels, charcoal and steaks, folding chairs and Cut wood. ( can't cut down trees for fires)Supplies that I know I'll need; but don't want to carry for 2189 miles. My prescriptions, extra batteries for my headlamp, toilet paper (very important), Bug spray, stuff like that. We are also putting extra trail bars and some foods in the box, so I don't have to pay trail prices.HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE? If I could do it in a week, it wouldn't be any fun.I anticipate about 6 months. Hoping to average 13 miles per day, plus the zero days in towns; I could be gone for 6 months. REALLY? Yep really!!!","Why?

Tendons and Muscles have locked up and the Doctor had to spray the Frozen stuff on my muscles and then work out the knocks in the muscles. Showed me how to do stretches (After I have hiked for an hour) when my muscles warm up; to continue taking Ibuprofen AND Tylenol at the same time.

I'm being taken back to where I left off and pick up my hike on Wednesday 27th and continue heading north. Most likely, I wont get all the way to Maine this season, but the more miles I get in ( providing no more injuries ) the fewer I'll have left to do.I am so looking forward to getting back out. I've lost 9 lbs. so far, plus I started getting rid of un-used backpack items. So that too dropped 4 more lbs. I won't be able to catch up with the group I've been hiking with, but I'll make new friends and I'll be meeting up with one of my hikers friends from Orlando for some miles.So for now, I'll see ya up the trail.Buckshot","Unicoi Gap

buckshot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539039,"I've heard it said, that people who hike the A.T. are trying to ""find"" them selves. Thats not me. I know who I am, what my role is, who my loved ones are, and so on.I've read that people are there to find God. I didn't do that; I took God with me. He spoke with me and I spoke back. Several Times. Some people are hiding, some are running, some are escaping every day life and some are looking for a new life.I've also read that hiking the A.T. changes you. I agree. I only was able to get 93 miles done (so far) and it's on my mine; constantly. I don't talk about it as much; as I know it drives everyone crazy, so I keep it to myself. I don't talk about it, maybe because I know what it expects of me; how hard it is; how exceptionally beautiful it is; how peacefull but frightening it is, and how lonely it can be. But it fills my mind.I plan to go back. Whether I finish on my next attempt or if I only get another 100 miles done. It's there for me; when ever I can get back. I met wonderful people. I walked alone for 3 hours once. I've seen a hiker taken out by helicopter due to an aparent heart attack. I saw a hiker with feet so blistered, that he could barely walk. I spoke with a girl, whose anxiety got her so bad, that she left the trail with 3 other people. I know a hiker, who twisted his ankle and is rehabing right now. I also know a girl who met a real nice guy; but later found out he wasn't nice.It's like an entirely different world;but never more than 8-10 miles as the crow flies, from civilization. Why do I want to go back; because it's calling me. I don't know why, it just is. It's like that cup of coffee or chocolate cake; you know it's there. You know what it can do for you. You know what it can do to you. But you just need it.","On the trail again

I've trained my knees better, I bought some Cho-pat knee braces, (they are supposed to be the best), I'm reviewing all my gear and will trim down what I know I didn't use last year.I might buy another Sawyer; as this one; although cleaned thoroughly, has been sitting for several months. Why take chances.Tent could be a bit bigger; but this one is light and paid for. Sleeping pad and bag are still good. Can't find my Injinji Toe socks.

buckshot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558038,"Teacher and the Students:February 2015; I attended a seminar in St Pete Florida at Bill Jacksons. The instructor was a young lady who has completed a full through hike. The seminar was a 2 day; full of information talk, that just drenched my already wet appetite. Sitting next to me was a nice lady from up north, and she knew the instructor; and she too was hoping for a thru hike. So for the next 13 months I was destined for training. My Aunt has been an avid hiker for years. She has hike all over the U.S. but has completed over 700 miles in the Smokey Mountains. So I tucked myself under her wings and hiked with her every week for months. We hiked for a couple of weeks in the Smokies. As my strength and trail legs became durable; I began my A.T. thru hike last year in 2016. I was unable to do more than a hundred miles, due to a family emergency; and then unable to get back on the trail after that. BUT, that's not the rest of the story.I planned to hike again this spring; when last fall, the young lady whom I got to know, through e'mails and Church; contacted me and said that she was trying to get a few people to go the Harpers Ferry to start the Flip Flop. I didn't even finish reading the e'mail, and I responded. SIGN ME UP. So; my training hikes with my Aunt, and the instructor encouraging us; the lady I sat next to is on the trail right now, and I am heading to Harpers Ferry in a couple of weeks. Not sure who will be going; but the Teacher will have 2 students on the trail at the same time.I also have to add; that I attended 2 seminars in Melbourne Fl by another instructor, and have had a few coffee dates with her and her husband to talk One on One, of hiking issues. The two of them also came to my rescue last year on my hike, when my knee gave out, met me on the trail and took me to get some knee braces. Trail Magic for sure, all the way from Melbourne Florida. Thanks for that. Thank you TEACHERS for the training, support, magic and prayers.","Harpers Ferry, W.V.
