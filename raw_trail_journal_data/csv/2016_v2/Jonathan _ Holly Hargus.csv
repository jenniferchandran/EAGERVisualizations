Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517723,"Busy season for my job begins when I should be hitting the trail in March/April. That's when we have to begin extracting our honey crop of orange blossom honey from our bees. At this point I've already decided to recruit my wife and my sister to help extract honey while I and my father in law harvest it. Hopefully with all of us working together we can finish our work sooner than usual and start our hike at Springer Mountain, otherwise if we must begin later than desired I'm considering starting in Maine.It'll be my wife, my sister, and myself...oh and my sister's dog too.We all have most of our gear and all that's left is the rest of our clothing and our food. My wife and I hiked the approach trail in October with 55-65 lbs and that was fun to the un-max. That's why I've decided to go lightweight this time and I can't wait to try it out. I really am hoping to enjoy the trail instead of droll along in misery like I did in October. More later...end log.","

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517732,"So I just finished reading 'the trail life' by Julie Urbanski. It's her tale of the PCT and the mental/emotional battle that she fought as she faced her own self. It's a great book for mind preparation. I highly recommend it if you are the type of person who found out that you aren't who you thought you were. I've just started her next book about taking on the Appalachian trail. Can't wait to see the challenges and changes she takes on. Experiences like hers are the kind that makes me hunger for the ' best of times and the worst of times. ' I can't wait to see who I become as the trail experience refines the me sitting here today.I wish that I had a starting date for the trail...oh well.We're just beginning to harvest our fall honey crop. It's a blend of goldenrod, Spanish needle, Brazilian pepper tree and Melaleuca tree, where tea tree oil comes from. Our next crop begins in the early spring, orange blossom, then...onto the trail.

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517760,"So I opted to camp out last night on black Friday, just like REI encouraged. I got to test my sleeping pad, a closed-cell foam pad. I'll be getting something else. I am a side sleeper so my bony hips were in pain. I'm gonna either go with a therm-a-rest air pad or a klymit air pad. Keeping in mind weight and compressed packing size.I also got to test out my Kelty trail bivy and my 2-person Kelty range tarp. I really liked them both. Condensation built up in the tarp of course but it was never dripping. And the bivy kept me warm using just my wool blanket (I slept in the yard.) The only other thing I did not like was our annoying rooster @ 2am. He must be part werewolf because the only thing out was the moon.","

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517795,"So I gave it another go last night camping in the yard. The were-rooster didn't bother me this time and I actually got some sleep. This time however the mosquitoes gave me a chance to try out the bug netting on my kelty bivy. It was great...mosquitoes 0 me 1. Also, while I was roughing it last night I found online, the trail that my wife and I would like to hike in 2017: Via Francigena. It's a pilgrimage trail about 1500 miles long from Canturbury, England to Rome, Italy. What!?This really appeals to us because we studied abroad in Florence, Italy for our 2009, 2010 school year and we have always wanted to return because we didn't value our time there as much as we should have.Ciao for now!
Check it out for yourself.","

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517926,"The more trail books I read, the more excited I get. But what's odd is that all of the struggles I read about are quite daunting. However, I shall not be deterred. It's hard to imagine hiking for 6 months. I can't wait. I keep looking for more information about the via francigena, possibly the European version of the Appalachian trail. More people attempt the AT than the via francigena, pronounced 'vee-a Fran-chee-ja-na' emphasis on the 'chee'.Not quite as long as the AT. My wife told my sister about it and she already wants to go with us in 2017.","

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518060,"Well my sister, who is also going with us in the spring, finally got her kelty tent for she and her dog. She's waiting on her sleeping bag to arrive in the mail. She has been showing me her gear as she gets it and I have a sneaky feeling that she's going to be o' wee bit overweight. HOWEVER, I have learned that the trail has a way of teaching everyone what's important and what's not. When I did the approach trail everything I took was completely useful, but that did not mean that I actually used it. Over the next 3 days I shaved weight from my pack as I decided what was important and what wasn't. That experience is why I have decided on doing the Appalachian trail lightweight. I want to be an ultimate hiker rather than an ultimate camper, as Andrew Skurka would say.","

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518223,"Okay so right now in central Florida you can occasionally smell Orange blossom wafting in the breeze. Our honeybees are loving it BUT they're not supposed to bloom for another 2 1/2 months. It's too warm in Florida and that's why the trees are confused. The problem is if they bloom and then we suddenly have freezing temperatures then the blossoms will die and there goes our Orange crop of honey.Why is that a big deal? Well the honey pays for the hike! Yikes!!Here's hoping for a balanced and timely bloom...Orange blossom is a very good honey but my favorite Florida honey is palmetto, especially when it blooms at the same time as gallberry. It tastes like a multi-fruit honey mixed with the best blueberries you have ever tasted. I wonder if anyone has ever seen wild honeybee colonies on the trail?Anyway, I'm looking forward to orange blossom to bloom but I'm especially looking forward to having it all harvested so we can hit the trail!","

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518256,"So I received my first encouragement from Hummingbird Ellie, via the guest book today. She's someone who's been on the trail and plans on going back soon. She had great advice about taking your time hiking during inclement weather to avoid unnecessary injury and also to hike light, which in my opinion is another way to avoid injury. Thanks again Hummingbird...Also, just ordered my trail hat! I'm real excited about that because it's an Australian made outback style hat. Made of a lightweight leather, vent holes, uv and water resistant made by Jacaru. It's coming from...you guessed it, Australia! Which means it could take a while to get here in Florida. Boo.I also just sold my Gregory pack online. Great pack, comfortable, holds everything and the kitchen sink but not my cup of tea. I used it on the approach trail. The pack itself is just over 6 lbs. Whoa. Check out my gear list to see what I'm using instead.Later...","

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518266,"So here's our plan for zero days. We'll be zero day-ing about once every 7 days on the trail rather than in town. Hopefully it'll be near a water source and ideally at a shelter but if not at a shelter that's okay.The idea is to rest, relax, rejuvenate and simply enjoy being. Even our meals will be simple, something that doesn't need cooked. I think the worst and possibly most boring zero days will be the cold/rainy ones. Can one learn to enjoy those days too? You can always play pick up sticks in the woods.","

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518304,"So my sister finally got her big agnes sleeping bag yesterday. It's 600 fill, rectangular in shape for her and her dog, and just over 3 lbs. We went through her hygiene and first aid kits together and I suggested how she could reduce weight and bulk. The amount of room she saved will make room for her sleeping bag to go inside her pack. We're going to be having a pre-trip meeting soon to talk about our expectations, concerns, hopes, doubts and whatever else about the trail. This way we'll see what page each of us are on and hopefully create a hike that will go more smoothly otherwise had we just gone all Willy nilly. After our meeting we're going to play a new Appalachian trail game I bought on Amazon. Woo hoo!","

Food, gear, clothing, etc. But there is a part that I really don't like: having to take care of any debts, bills, and other payments like taxes, before I can even begin to budget for being on the trail.

I wish when we were feeling down and defeated that a magical motivational soundtrack started playing out of nowhere. Our brow would knit, our fists would clench, a grin would appear on our face and we would scream to the heavens in a voice that levels all opposing forces. Yeah, that would be cool.I like the tiger song by Katy Perry. The end.","

Our beekeeping duties require us to work at the same time nobos are heading out and we have to sell our honey crop to finish our trail preparation and obligatory stupid bills. But yay!

The bloom has been going strong for two weeks now and will hopefully go for another week or two. Our goal is to finish the orange harvest and sell a couple of barrels before palmetto starts to bloom (my favorite Florida honey). Then we'll hopefully be set financially from our on-trail expenses. I filled bubble tea straws with honey for our oatmeal on the trail. Yum!I'll soon be posting more detailed information about our gear/weight for anyone interested.","Maine

It's fun but it's also a lot of work too!And, we got our tarp tent today in the mail!! It's the lunar duo explorer by Six Moon Designs. I got it seam sealed for an extra $30. Worth it. Also got a tube of seam sealer for the road and their large tyvek footprint. The shelter by itself weighs in at 2 lbs 10 ounces. Didn't have time to put it up though. It was a busy day at work. We had to check out our bees that are on watermelon pollination and it was a long trip.42 days till we head for Georgia...to catch a train to Maine.","

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528410,"So I recently bought a new shelter, the Six Moon Designs Explorer Lunar Duo. It is replacing our first shelter we were going to use for the trail. It was the Kelty Range Tarp. Now don't get me wrong, it was a great tarp but we needed bivy sacks to use with its bottomless floor which made our shelter system almost 6 lbs!! Then I was like, 'i don't think so!' So in comes SMD. Weighing in at 2 lbs 10 ounces for two people. With its lightweight awesomeness, it has a bathtub floor, vertical mesh walls with high headroom (and I'm 6'4""), attached to a waterproof silnylon tarp and two large vestibule. Very easy to set up too.Well, we set it up tonight for the first time...it's a winner. And I can't wait to use it on the trail.Oh and it's mother-in-law approved","Katahdin

It'll be nice when all of the traveling is over with and we're finally at Baxter State Park. Travel goes like this: car-train-bus-shuttle-foot.Gear update: the mother-in-law, who has decided to use an off-trail, trail name of 'Frail Angel', got us a camera to use for the trail adventure. Thanks so much! It's an Olympus TG-4. It's supposed to be tough, and therefore durable to withstand trail life. I have been using it around the yard and am very impressed with it. I wish this was the camera we had while studying abroad in Italy. With the battery it weighs in at only 8.8 ounces and fits in my pants pocket but my wife is going to carry it so it doesn't really matter, hehe.We are almost finished preparing our resupply boxes too, just in time for final preparations. We're not sure if my sister will be joining us. She only gets paid once per month and train tickets are getting pricier by the day. Even if she is able to make it I believe that her pack weight, being double that of ours, and the fact that she's bringing her canine companion, will put hiking distance between us. But at least she would be on the trail.Update on the sister: she just called and told me that she got her train ticket. She'll be leaving the same day as us but from here in Florida instead of Georgia, with us. That puts her only a few hours behind us and meeting up in Baxter at pretty much the same time.

All of our gear, clothing, and food are ready. Just gotta pack the trailer and hit the road in 8 days. I got my lunch packed up, my boots tied tight, I hope I don't get in a fight!In a couple of days we're sending our first 5 or 6 resupply boxes out ahead of us. The rest of the resupply boxes will be sent by our super supporters here at the Florida home base. Here's a sample of what our food is like: Bob's Red Mill quick cook oats, regular and steel cut, jerky from grass fed, healthy sources; Epic turkey, beef, and lamb, Wyoming sticks, and Nicks Sticks. Bear Valley Pemmican bars with four different flavors and over 400 calories each, dehydrated lentils, split peas, black beans, Brown rice, veggies, tons of different spices and seasonings, bbq spaghetti, instant mashed potatoes, cinnamon apples, hemp protein bars, raisins, jelly babies and wine gums, dagoba chocolate bars, and straws filled with honey, braggs amino acids (soy sauce), toasted sesame seed oil, and olive oil. Oh, and packets of pink salmon to go with brown rice.I put my Vespa in storage for the trip. I tried to sell it before the trail but people here in this part of Florida prefer trucks with big tires and loud exhaust pipes. But that's okay because I really like my Vespa.

We experienced blistering heat and below freezing temperatures. Poppy, our little tipi bunny, is probably the first bunny ever to live in a tipi. We have an outdoor covered shower and composting toilet. Setting up the tipi is a big job though and since we'll only be there for a few days we're not going to set it up this time. We have spent a total of six months living in the tipi and it's one of our fondest memories. Maybe after the trail we'll set it up again. We live one county over from Springer Mountain.

It's past hiker midnight but I'm staying up by kerosene lamp light to write. We have had a great week seeing friends and family before the trail and some of them we didn't think we would see and did anyways. First was cousin Mollie! Holly got to hang out with her in Blue Ridge.Then we went to have lunch at an amazing Greek restaurant called Great Greek Gyros. We have known the owner for about a year now and she makes the BEST gyros! She is half Greek and half Italian which makes her extra cool and kinda feisty. We met her daughter also today and she's awesome to talk to and she's outdoorsy too.Then we went to Blue Ridge to get cupcakes and cheesecake at the SweetShop. Our friend Ashley was there and that was a big surprise. We've known her since we've been coming to this area for three years now. She's getting married next year. We invited her along on the trail but she would probably get lost  So she'll stay here.Then we went to the Blue Rige Jerky because last year we met the owner, Christy, and it was cool because she had jerky from healthy sources and I didn't think a store like that even existed. She thought it was cool that we lived in a tipi, so we always go say hey to her when we come up. We weren't sure if we would see her either today so that was another great surprise. We got some jerky here for the trail...thanks Christy!And now we just got back from hanging out with cousin Renee and her husband Kurt. They live only five minutes away. They are really cool people and great family. They're the type that would give you the shirt off their backs and maybe even a sock.And then we found out today that our longtime best friend Nugent Myr, that we went to Italy with, is coming down for a night to hangout, sip some tea, and read some books with us. We've known each other for like forever which equates to eight years, whoa!All of this is amazing because in general I can't stand humans.

She picked us up from our place today in her nice new Jeep, thank you. And she brought her friend Madison as navigator, water bottle opener, and banana peeler. First I have to say that they made this experience a lot more fun and a lot less stressful than it could have been. You girls made our send off a very memorable one, thank you both so much!So the four of us pull up to the station and it's located in the middle of Sketchy-ville! Not a good feeling. All of our spidey senses were on red alert. We try to go inside but the whole place is locked up tight. Madison finds out online that the station doesn't open till 8pm, which is one hour before our train leaves, and it's only 4pm, 5 hours to wait at a deserted train station in a sketchy neighborhood! So the girls took us with them, driving around town killing time. We eventually stopped at Cook Out, a fast food chain in this area with grilled burgers and like 40 something flavors of shakes and got a bite to eat. We drive back to the station again and park. The car next to us belongs to a guy with greasy hair and a suit. He was up to something, I don't know what, but all four of us were so uncomfortable that we started driving around again. Eventually, with only 3 1/2 hours left, the girls dropped us back off at the train station which was still locked up. After hugs and goodbyes, cousin Mollie and Madison left for Blairsville. We walked around to the track side of the station trying to find a bench, but alas there were none. At this point we have locked up our house, locked and left our car, only have our packs, some food, and half a gallon of water; we are feeling very alone and abandoned. But, not without the knowledge that we have always been provided for in the past. So we looked for a place to sit on the concrete floor when suddenly an employee door opens up and a man pops out, his name is Chris. He tells us to come inside and allows us into the waiting room. He asks where we're hiking, we tell him the Appalachian trail, he says he sees lots of AT hikers come through here. He then asks if we have enough food and water. Yes, we have some of both, but he gives us a pack of bottled water and some moisty towels kits, and another pack of waters!!!

The car next to us belongs to a guy with greasy hair and a suit. He was up to something, I don't know what, but all four of us were so uncomfortable that we started driving around again. Eventually, with only 3 1/2 hours left, the girls dropped us back off at the train station which was still locked up. After hugs and goodbyes, cousin Mollie and Madison left for Blairsville. We walked around to the track side of the station trying to find a bench, but alas there were none. At this point we have locked up our house, locked and left our car, only have our packs, some food, and half a gallon of water; we are feeling very alone and abandoned. But, not without the knowledge that we have always been provided for in the past. So we looked for a place to sit on the concrete floor when suddenly an employee door opens up and a man pops out, his name is Chris. He tells us to come inside and allows us into the waiting room. He asks where we're hiking, we tell him the Appalachian trail, he says he sees lots of AT hikers come through here. He then asks if we have enough food and water. Yes, we have some of both, but he gives us a pack of bottled water and some moisty towels kits, and another pack of waters!!! This trip is already weeding out our fears and apprehensions.So, thank you so much to our first trail angels: cousin Mollie, Madison, and train station Chris","

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535628,"So, cousin Mollie wanted to know what our train experience was like from Gainesville Georgia. She picked us up from our place today in her nice new Jeep, thank you. And she brought her friend Madison as navigator, water bottle opener, and banana peeler. First I have to say that they made this experience a lot more fun and a lot less stressful than it could have been. You girls made our send off a very memorable one, thank you both so much!So the four of us pull up to the station and it's located in the middle of Sketchy-ville! Not a good feeling. All of our spidey senses were on red alert. We try to go inside but the whole place is locked up tight. Madison finds out online that the station doesn't open till 8pm, which is one hour before our train leaves, and it's only 4pm, 5 hours to wait at a deserted train station in a sketchy neighborhood!

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535902,"Well we arrived in Portland Maine late last night by bus from Boston, a very pretty city. Portland is also gorgeous. I have decided through personal experience that transportation by any method other than ""beam me up Scotty,"" sucks. My sister had a much longer distance to travel coming from Florida. She wasn't due to arrive in Portland until 2pm today by train. Originally, Holly and I would have left Portland this morning to Bangor by bus then another bus to Medway where our shuttle service from the Appalachian trail lodge would have picked us up to spend the night in Millinocket. However, my sister would have only made it to Bangor but not in time to catch the only once-daily bus to Medway. She didn't have enough money to stay the night there so Holly and I decided to wait for my sister and stay here in Portland together and finish the journey to Baxter State Park together. At this point our launch date to katahdin should be June 2nd.We just ate dinner and it has been a good day. Btw, Nugen, if you're reading this, you must try the mint infused liquid cane sugar....it is amazing!!","

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536082,"We are sitting here at the bus station in Bangor Maine, waiting for our 6:30pm bus to Medway. We've seen many people come and go over the last 4 1/2 hours. But I'll just tell you about the ones with backpacks. The first person to come in with a pack was a girl, tall with dark hair with blue tips; looks pretty cool. She has a large teal Osprey pack. Then two dudes came in together also with Osprey packs. Some of their gear looked dirty already so I assumed they were nobos going home but as I was eavesdropping on the guys talking to the girl I found out that the two guys already hiked Georgia and now they're completing the trail sobo. The girl is going sobo because she knows someone who was a sobo and plus it gave her a chance to save up more money for the trail.Why was I eavesdropping? Because, remember, I am a sobo and am less social than many, by choice. I plan on opening up more out on the trail but till then don't talk to me...totally just kidding! Haha, ahem.So there are a total of 6 AT hikers in here right now. 5 Osprey packs and one Gregory pack. The moral of the story is to use an Osprey pack !!There is also an Amish family sitting in the corner. An older man and woman traveling with a young man. They're each wearing the traditional clothing you would see an Amish family wear. They've been speaking in Pennsylvania Dutch, I'm fairly certain. They seem really nice as they are smiling and laughing while they eat their bigmacs.Maine is beautiful and the weather is gorgeous. It feels just like it did in Georgia a week ago. Anyways, I would like to take a moment and say hello and thank you to Worm, a bloke from Scotland who is following our journey! That's so awesome! He signed our guest book a couple of days ago, which I, we, really enjoy reading. I encourage all of you who follow us through the woods to message us through signing the guest book.Ill let you know of any more interesting conversations I eavesdrop in on. Ciao!!","

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536146,"Not sure why but trail journals placed this update in front of the earlier one today.
Update: Finally made it to the Appalachian trail lodge! They said this was their biggest group ever and that the concord coach line driver, for the first time ever, had to call ahead to the Lodge with this, ""I've got a bus full of those AT hiker people. You'd better have two shuttles ready to get all these people to the Lodge.""So we've already set a new record for them. They even had a banner welcoming the AT hiker class of 2016!This is really a great place and I'm so glad we are here.This may be our last chance to update until the end of the 100 mile wilderness, approximately 12 days from now...stay tuned.","

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538294,"Day 1. I don't even want to write about it. At the moment, thinking about today's events makes me feel nauseous, seriously. Today was wonderful, today was breathtaking, it was challenging but most of all it was scary. When I say 'scary' I mean true fright. When I was a boy of about 10 years old, my family moved to a bad neighborhood. My brothers and I were told not to leave our neighborhood to venture off into the nearby worse neighborhood. Well we did. As we were walking on the sidewalk we approached two younger kids with mean looks on their faces. They approached us and then one of them pulled out a gun and held it to my forehead. Today, Katahdin was ten times scarier than that boy with the gun.In my opinion Holly and I were very close to becoming part of the mountain flora and fauna, if you know what I mean. So, the story. Holly and I and Lynn and her dog Shadow began hiking the AT up to Katahdin at about 9am, after finally getting checked in at the ranger station. The first three miles were became gradually steeper with large rocks to climb over and around. Skipping ahead, rising above the tree line offered the most amazing views I have ever seen and sent more than a few fellow hikers back down with anxiety attacks, without even reaching the summit. It took hours to reach this point at which the boulder field began. To begin this point you had to reach a rebar on the boulder and pull yourself up. This is the point where Lynn and Shadow had to stop and where Holly and I should have as well. Everyone we met coming down off of the mountain said it was just over an hour to the summit from this point, and no doubt for them it was. But down is faster than up. So we told Lynn we would summit and then come back and watch Shadow for her while she went to summit. Little did we know that we wouldn't reach the top for many more hours. Just as a side note to all you who enjoy reading trail books and journals, no one writes about Katahdin in its true experience. Yeah, its officially part of the Appalachian trail but it is NOT A TRAIL!! We had to climb boulders hand over hand as big as your house at a forty five degree angle for like a quarter mile. And guess what, these rocks are sharp. And to tell the truth, this would have been okay. I enjoyed this unique challenge and testing my body past anything I've ever done. But the last mile and a half was what nearly killed us...literally. The weather took a turn for the worst, but it wasn't obvious. To us it just looked like fog and everyone we passed said we were almost there and were encouraging us to not give up. So we pressed on. We donned our down jackets from our day pack and that's when the wind picked up. Actually it was there all along, blowing and gusting without notice of us being there. With the wind was the cooling moisture and we quickly became soaked. We were SO close and wanted to make it all the way but I was so miserable at this point that it was difficult to think about making it 5 miles back down. So, we trudged on, from one rock to another. The fog was so dense that our visibility became difficult at only 40 feet. I glanced up towards the top and saw the silhouette of the ever popular sign of Katahdin. I yelled to Holly that I could see it! In a couple of minutes we were there, our visibility now down to ten feet. We couldn't see anything but the sign and a few large rocks in the immediate vicinity. I had the camera and phone camera ready, snapped Holly's pictures, she snapped mine, and then we took refuge down below the sign out of the wind.At this point we had to eat and drink because we were starving. Secretly in my head, without telling Holly, I didn't see the possibility of getting off this mountain, much less below the tree line. My body was done. In a future journal I may share my physical challenges with those of you who don't know what I've been through. Our clothing was soaked, hands freezing, feet numb, bodies broken, hope was all we had. My mind went back and forth between praying for mercy from all of this and contemplating my death. We had two miles of wind and rain to the tree line at which point we felt much better. Looking back now I know that it was YAH and my wife's encouragement that got me off of that mountain. I have never seen death so closely before. Would I do it again? Nope. That was one sucky experience. I am pretty sure that I experienced mild hypothermia. My fingertips on my right hand are still tingling and somewhat numb. But I am glad we made such an accomplishment, not just making it to the top but making it back down. Katahdin is much more than you guys can possibly imagine. Words are nothing to describe it. But then there are those who are much more capable than I at this point. One man I just learned about has climbed the mountain 70 something times in his life. I don't know if that's accurate or not but I do know that once was good enough for us. It took us 14 hours. My sister headed back after half an hour of waiting. And now we're ready for anything...because Katahdin is way behind us!","Katahdin Stream Campground

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538296,"Day 2. It was only ten miles today. Only ten?!! Only ten, after a day of going up and down Katahdin. Had we not done the summit then today would have been WAY easier. I believe that I have discovered a new feature on my backpack and it's not something they tell you about at the outfitter: my pack has the ability to gradually absorb the surrounding air and slowly increase my pack weight. Yup, this morning I started with about 28-30 lbs and by the time we arrived at Abol bridge it weighed in at 45 lbs. It's magical.But the trail was gorgeous as it followed along a beautiful river of rushing white water. The 'maine' challenge of the trail today was roots. But not just any roots. These apparently have the ability to grow instantly up from the ground, wrap around a hiker's ankle and pull them down into oblivion.Holly and I learned something else today too; we thought that my sister's pack weight and dog would keep her trailing far behind us. But no, in fact her one-dog sled team propels her far ahead until she stops so we can catch up. Ever tasted crow?","Katahdin Stream Campground

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538297,"Day 3 finds us here on the Penobscot River at Abol Pines campground across the road from the Abol bridge campground. There are fewer sites but it is more affordable. I'm sitting here catching up on days 1 & 2 for the journal while a group of white water rafters head downstream.Today is our first zero day. The last two days, as you know, were grueling. Holly and Lynn are both physically in pain as their bodies refuse to do anything with effort. But I was like that yesterday and today I feel pretty good so I believe they are recovering well and will feel much better tomorrow morning when we begin the 100 mile wilderness!! We also call it the 100 acre wood because of Winnie the Pooh. So far today we have acquainted ourselves with our campsite neighbor, Nehemiah. A super nice guy who bummed an already hurt knee. He left his life in California and decided to do something with his life and hit the trail. Tonight will be his third night at the campground giving his knee a rest. He's determined to head out tomorrow into the wilderness. We're rooting for him.Last night was our first night in our tent, the Six Moon Designs Lunar Duo. Lots of room. At this point our plans are to take an easy day tomorrow, known as a nero day, and hike just three miles into the wilderness to the Hurd Brook lean to.","Abol Pines Campground
",Zero day,"Jun 04, Sat",0
Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538299,"Day 4. Today we each woke up feeling great. Lynn no longer walks like a grandma. We got to know a guy named Shawn. He works construction in Boston and comes to Abol Pines Campground a lot to unwind. He knows everything about the area and really enjoys helping out anyone including hikers so Holly started calling him the Caretaker. He thought it was funny that my sister is going without a stove and eating cold food. She had a Ziploc baggie of cold oatmeal sitting near the fire, trying to warm it up and so Shawn called her a cave girl, who seemed to have just discovered fire for the first time; and thus was born Lynn's trail name: Cave Girl.
So we hiked three miles today from Abol bridge to Hurd Brook shelter. Holly and I beat Lynn...haha!! We met a ridge runner who gave us tons of advice and information. Her name is Moxie, from the cola drink up here in the north. We met our first nobo today named Dirt, who started in February. He signed the log book and left. Right now there are about 15 or so people at a six man lean to. But only three of us are inside and everyone else is in their own shelters.
We've got three days to get past Jo Mary rd. To pick up our resupply. The Appalachian trail lodge will drop off a five gallon bucket of our food in a secret hiding place. They gave us instructions on where to find it but I lost them. Fortunately I took a picture of them with my camera. At this point we are 37 miles away from there. Hopefully we can do twelve miles tomorrow. We'll see!","Abol Pines Campground
",Hurd Brook lean to,"Jun 05, Sun",3.50
Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538302,"Day 5 oh my gosh!!! Beautiful scenery today...and we had to step over every bit of it. The early climb of the day was not bad but once at the top the scene of Katahdin was just fog so we pressed on. We met another nobo whose name was D-Do It. He said that once he's finished he will be D-Done It. He asked for some sugar to help kill his craving for alcohol so I gave him one of our honey sticks. All day we have been leapfrogging with Dan and his granddaughter Alexis. She's very young, almost 19, and was feeling homesick. Her pap, as she calls him said to at least give the wilderness an honest attempt and that if she wanted to go home still then he would put her on a bus and continue on by himself. They're both really nice people to hike along with.
The main challenges today were three things: 1) Shadow walking on Holly's heels. She nearly tripped her a thousand times. 2) the constant pits of deep wet mud...Arghhhh!! 3) the beautiful cypress forest, ROOTS!!! Those last two things really slowed down our 11.5 mile day. Longest day yet in an attempt to make our resupply on time. We can already tell a difference in our bodies but at the same time we still get frikin tired, sore and worn out. It's usually our feet and ankles, mixed in with a little hip for good measure.
Finally making it to the Rainbow Stream lean to, we saw an amazing view of it on the stream. There's a bunch of tent sites up on the hill behind but they're not very level. A hammock would be much more ideal here. I really like our tarp tent but my sleeping mat sucks. It's the Thermarest neo air, 3/4 length. The air mattress itself is not a problem but it's virtually a slip-n-slide on the tent's silnylon floor. A full night of rest continues to elude me, but I am a hunter and will soon figure out where it's hiding. On the plus side we saw a cow moose at the beginning of Rainbow Stream.","Hurd Brook lean to
",Rainbow Stream lean to,"Jun 06, Mon",11.50
Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538304,"Day 6- 8 miles today up and down Nesuntabunt mountain. This has been by far the most continually steep up and down hill grades so far. The four of us were spread out hiking at our own paces today and Holly and I shared the lead. She is strong going down hill and me up. But the last three miles I had to use my poles because my right hip was having severe pain and weakness. We were last to leave camp at 9am and were passed by one other hiker on a twenty mile day.
Lynn, Cave Girl, was usually far behind and out of sight. But you could always hear her, ""Shadow! Stay! Shadow, wait!!"" And of course Shadow doesn't listen and she takes on down the trail after Holly and I. I eventually got fed up with the dog and so I told her firmly to SIT and STAY. And guess what? She did.
But Shadow is becoming a problem by pulling to hard on the leash and dragging Cave Girl too fast too soon. I think Cave Girl is not enjoying the trail as much as she was hoping she would with Shadow. 
We're camping near Dan and Alexis. We talked for hours about lots of stuff. We really enjoy their company. Our friend Nehemiah has got a lot of the hiking bubble here at Wadleigh Stream lean to in high hopes for burgers and pizza tomorrow at some Landing. We shall see!!","Rainbow Stream lean to
",Wadleigh Stream lean to,"Jun 07, Tue",8.10
Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538305,"Day 7- The trail knew what we all needed today, which was a fairly flat terrain. But don't think for a moment that the trail was free from roots and rocks, no no. The whole bubble of 15 sobos were high tailing it to get to the Blue blaze for Whitehouse Landing but when we got there we found a note from Jolly Rancher that the owners were out of town and that there would be no burgers, no pizza. Turns out that they were three hours away and said that they would come if we could wait and agree to stay the night. We didn't wait. Whitehouse Landing lost out on about $1500 today, according to my calculations. My guess is that they aren't in season except for the nobos.
This morning we got up early and actually hit the trail at 7:15am. That made all the difference. We weren't last arriving in camp and we had time to do our camp chores at our leisure. We showed up around 2:30pm. Not too bad for 10.1 miles, and yes, I count every tenth mile. Cave Girl and Shadow got in last about half an hour after us. She had a good day until she fell in the mud up to her knee and got stuck. Somehow she got out. Her attitude is surprisingly positive for what she's experiencing out here. Shadow is ready to die at the end of each day. I'm not sure what they'll do after the wilderness. Holly and I both really look forward to arriving in Monson. We plan on staying at the Lake shore House. We hope to get cell reception on the top of one of these forsaken mountains to make reservations. Some other hikers shared their food with us trying to lighten their load. Holly and I are both fed, warm, and ready for bed just after 8pm. The wilderness can be extremely daunting. You have to make the mileage depending upon your food supply, no matter how treacherous the trail is. We have a zero day coming up in four or five days. Looking at our food that we have, we'll just be squeezing out of the wilderness just in time. We also look forward to tomorrow because we pick up our stashed resupply bucket with the next six days of food. And right before White Cap Mountain.","Wadleigh Stream lean to

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538306,"Day 8- Hit the trail at 7:15am on the dot for the second day in a row! Rolled into the Cooper Brook Falls lean to eight hours later. The terrain was perfect today. Holly slipped once and her weight went back on one leg affecting her hind muscles. Today was very windy and cold. I hiked in my down shell all day and am still wearing it. This morning was 39 degrees Fahrenheit, but wasn't too bad while moving around doing camp chores. I think tonight will be colder. 
Dan and Alexis passed us and grabbed a great tent pad. We got the best ones because they were slightly past the shelter. It's really nice that they were looking out for us.
Nehemiah, now dubbed Karma, shared some of his food with us and others. Marbles also shared with us, and I wasn't even asking. They both get their resupply tomorrow and needed help lightening their packs. 
Holly and I were almost to camp when we found out that Karma found Cave Girl, my sister, less than three quarters of a mile into the hike. Apparently Shadow refused to walk any further. Cave Girl was getting really stressed out about it and with Karma's help, they walked back to camp and then three tenths of mile more to a road where they called out for a ride. Then Karma hiked back, got his stuff, and finally made it here later. Nehemiah has a rare selflessness that is very much appreciated.
Meanwhile, we're looking at the guide book and realize that we won't get to Monson for another seven days and Lynn is in a comfortable bed with a hot shower in Medway!! We have one zero day coming up and were going to be short on food but with the extra our fellow hikers shared with us we will be just fine.

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538308,"Day 9- We left after eight o clock this morning bound for the Logan Brook lean to. Today was the first day that we finally started to feel a difference physically. We felt better and stronger and because of that we used our energy and still got way tired miles before the end point for the day. We had miles of hemlock forest, the kind you see in a wall calendar and wish you were there...no you don't. That forest never ended! It was the hemlock forest of doom and despair. Once we got out, three million miles later, we still had to climb two thirds the way up White Cap Mountain. That was like forty degrees for hours. And the temperature dropped continually. Well our hiking buddies, Dan and Alexis who arrived first, told us that the only good tent sites were a tenth mile before the lean to. So we squeezed all three tent's into a small area of flat gravel. Afterwards, I realized that there was a dead birch tree leaning over our tent's, yikes!! Don't worry, we didn't die.
Anyways, Dan and Alexis got their trail names. Dan is always saying stuff like ,""isn't it great to be here? There's no better place to be right now."" So his name is Brightside. Alexis however, fell off one of the bog boards and onto her back. She couldn't move as she was stuck on her backpack in the mud. Brightside thought this was quite funny and she is now known as Bog Turtle. But she's had enough of this wilderness and will be going home after Monson.

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538317,"Day 10- Even though we were two thirds up White Cap Mountain, we were still two hours from its summit. Oh my gosh!!! This mountain was straight up! The top afforded great views and we quickly found the others and sat down with them for a break. This was one of four mountains today. At the top everyone said that they have been referring to us amongst themselves as The Beekeeper and Honey Bear, and thus we were dubbed our trail names. The next mountain in the range we were hiking was Hay mountain, then West Peak, and the last was Gulf Hagas Mountain which I called Grand Nagus Mountain. Each mountain was less tall than the last BUT each up and down was more steep than the last. Holly's toes kept being pushed, battered and bruised on the down hills. Pretty much the day sucked a fatty. But we're finally here at the Carl A. Newhall lean to with a sketchy couple and their dog, but at least they had a nice warm fire going. The only annoying thing really was their dog was chasing squirrels, off leash, and ripped through one of our guylines, ripping one of our seams. I was so annoyed! I tried to fix it with melted beeswax and some repair tape from Brightside.On the plus side, our lower elevation and south facing side of the mountain made for a fairly warm evening comparatively. And again, this lean to has horrible tent sites so Brightside and Bog Turtle squeezed room for us again. Thanks guys.","Logan Brook lean to

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538320,"Day 11- Zero day reflections: today was freaking cold and windy. We woke up to rain. Everyone in camp made today a zero day. We stood around the fire for most of the day just socializing, which was actually nice. Before starting this trip I was really hoping that we would have the trail virtually to ourselves. Turns out there are a lot more sobos than expected. Ironically, it's the socializing that gets a person through this experience mentally. Today's particular ingredients of weather make Holly and I want to quit but we feel quite sure that we cannot judge the entire AT experience on the wilderness and Maine, the most difficult part of the trail.Suffice it to say, we both look forward to Thursday afternoon when we emerge from this wilderness, and get to the Lake shore House in Monson. There will be hot showers, warm beds, blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup and eggs, and burgers. It's really strange but I find myself thinking, ""what if Monson runs out of food before we get there? I hope they have enough."" We can make it, we can do it!!

Newhall lean to we went over Chairback Mountain, ending at Chairback Gap lean to in 9.9 miles. Then the next day from that lean to over four mountains ending at Long Pond Stream lean to in 11.4 miles. It's almost impossible to describe the pain and torture that these mountains left impressed on our minds and feet. Our feet truly were kept from being dashed upon a stone, as we're our skulls. Instead of trying to recount the most arduous and crippling last two days to you, instead I invite you to join me in reading the following letter addressed to the state of Maine: Dear Maine, I believe we have had a misunderstanding. You see, this ever so popular Appalachian footpath is called a trail for a reason. I encourage you to get a dictionary, any dictionary, and look up the meaning of the word ""trail."" While you're doing that I would like to explain to you what a trail is not- a trail is not a moose path meandering through the craggy forest boulders; a trail is not a stream bed full of water and mud; and lastly, a trail is not a mountain stream whose eroding reveals every toe stubbing and hiker tripping rock and root. If you only had two or three weeks to make a trail, as the rumor goes, why oh why would you create the most impossible route over every high elevation that Maine has too offer!?!? Wouldn't you have sought out a nice meandering footpath along the forest floor? Until you have complied with the actual guidelines of a true trail, I hereby dismember you from the Appalachian trail, which as of now ends/begins at the Maine/New Hampshire state line.

Well, we are currently in a comfortable bed at the Lakeshore House. We weren't due to be here till tomorrow! So what happened?  We woke up in the Long Pond Stream lean to this morning after a four mountain day ending with a 1200 foot decrease in altitude in the last murderous mile of the day. We started this morning with the goal of 12 miles ending at the Leeman Brook lean to, but we only made it 5.1 miles of the trail. The problem was the wear and tear on our feet over the previous two days. Holly's calf muscle and my Achilles heel slowed us down so much we were hiking with extreme pain from over used muscles. Every 80 degree uphill and downhill sent Holly into a crying rage. We were afraid of the overuse turning into a bad injury. We were trying to remain positive because the sun, for the first time since we started hiking, made an appearance accompanied by a blue sky. But it got so bad for us both that we didn't think we would make camp by sundown. So somewhere around mile three of the day I made the decision to call the hostel. I asked if they could get us out of the wilderness early. They said yes and told me where to meet them at an agreed upon time and place. So we still had to hike a mile and a half to the railroad tracks, at which point we hiked another two miles southeast on the tracks, feeling crippled and broken the whole way. We officially left the trail today at mile 104.5; mile 89.5 of the hundred mile wilderness. We are both showered, well fed, have our resupply, clean laundry, and a comfortable bed. We will decide tomorrow what our plan of action will be next. Until then we need to heal before making any decisions that are too easy to make right now, (quitting!) They all say that Maine is the hardest part, and we don't want to judge the entire trail based upon Maine's pathetic attempt at a trail.Btw, it's great to see all the encouraging comments in our guestbook. Thank you so much!","Long Pond Stream lean to

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538464,"Day 15- What to do? Well we're taking a zero day to heal up and figure out what we're going to do. I believe that our attitudes have healed during our stay in Monson, because we have decided to forge on. But, our bodies are not yet convinced. Holly and I both have a swollen ankle/heel. We can't zero forever, but we also should not hike ourselves into more permanent injuries. The thought of figuring out travel arrangements out of here and off of the trail is not appealing. We do have everything that we need to keep hiking and at a leisurely pace too, but again, if it hurts to walk to the bathroom then what's the trail going to be like with a 30 lb pack? Anyways, for those of you who are wondering, hikers can stay at Shaw's or here at the Lakeshore House in Monson. If you like the hiker hostel environment and want room to set up your tent in the yard with a fairly nice gear/food resupply then Shaw's is for you. If you're looking for comfort and a very social environment, say like a downstairs pub and restaurant then try the Lakeshore House where we are. Then there's Brightside and Bog Turtle; they rolled in today and are staying a mile and a half away at something called 100 mile wilderness hostel or something. That place is for those of you who would like silence and privacy. They'll even shuttle you into town here for food. Our stay here has been really great. It's open Mic night downstairs, which is a pretty nice background to the evening from our room.For now we are packed and ready, but for what I do not yet know. Tomorrow will hopefully bring the answer...right after an all you can eat blueberry pancake breakfast with eggs at Shaw's! Think healing thoughts.","Lakeshore House

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538567,"Day 16- This morning was gorgeous! The weather is simply beautiful today and the swelling in my heel is down by half. I grounded/earthed today sitting on the dock with my feet in the Lake. I've also been applying sore muscle rub by Badger Balm and it's helped a lot. So we've decided that tomorrow morning we will take the shuttle to the trail head and keep going. Our next resupply is in Caratunk but now that we're out of the wilderness we are going to take our time and shorten our daily mileage. Hopefully this will allow our bodies to build up at a more appropriate pace.Holly and I headed back to the dock and I stuck my feet in the water again this afternoon after a nice restful nap. Two planes landed on the water and docked, so that was cool to see. My pains are making bigger strides in feeling better today. We skipped lunch because we're still full from breakfast and we're trying to save some money. It's not so much the hostel fee that breaks the bank, it's the food. Brightside and Bog Turtle invited us to supper tonight at a bbq joint. I hear they have collards!!So I just found out that the bbq place is closed. Rumor is that they ran out of food, whatever that means. Someone forgot to restock...oooh. So we shared supper here at the hostel instead, which was great. It is now time for a special announcement: Pete's Place. It's literally right next door. It's a mom and pop store if I've ever seen one. They have amazing food! Breakfast that you cannot finish and Gifford's ice cream. They have a small resupply for food with good choices but not much gear. We did get another fuel canister for our jet boil stove though. The owners are very friendly and they bake their own breads and pastries on site. Their pancakes are HUGE! You can get real maple syrup too. One of their breakfasts is called the 100 miler. If you finish in an hour you get your picture on the wall. I did not even try it. They serve breakfast and lunch. If you're in this area you must go to Pete's Place.Holly and I are in for the night and I have mapped out our next 6 days. They are all between 5-7 miles each day with one zero stuffed in there for good measure. Next stop, Caratunk.
Thanks to those signing the guestbook, Plank, for your experienced wisdom and encouragement, Frail Angel and my mom for their words of encouragement always, Dory, for wishing us luck with our debit cards, and my best friend Travis who is much wiser than I. He knew better than to do what I am doing and I hope he's at home sitting on the couch playing video games.","Lakeshore House, Monson

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538988,"Day 17- Rebekah, the owner of the Lakeshore House, dropped us off at the blue blaze to the trail head at 7:30am. It was really great getting to know her a little bit. She never pressured us into our nightly fees or registration when we arrived. She simply got us some ice cold tea, showed us to our room, and told us where the shower was so that we could settle in and relax. I highly recommend staying at the Lakeshore House, especially because it's right next door to Pete's Place.We ate leftover pancakes, banana, and an oatmeal cookie for breakfast. I'm still slow and stiff today but hope to take it easy since our mileage is low today. It was 5.6 miles to the Horseshoe Canyon lean to on some of the best terrain we've seen so far but it took us nine and a half hours to do it, which is less than one mile per hour. We took several breaks at a much more reasonable pace and I soaked my feet at least three times along the way. At the Ford today we took an hour break because our bubble caught up with us. Our bubble consists of Karma, Whiskey, Bubbles/Pancakes, Jolly Rancher, and Acorn. They are all pushing on tomorrow while we take our scheduled zero day at the lean to. The day wasn't too bad except for one flaw in the slaw, as Roscoe P. Coltrane likes to say. We came upon a really picturesque forest of trees on our left. I got the camera out and snapped a picture. We then continued down the wide path, which was oddly yellow blazed. A quarter mile later we came to MA 85, a dirt road not on any map. There were three guys on atv's taking a break that tried to help us figure out where we were. None of us knew so we headed back up the way we came. Holly went on ahead of me and when she got to the same spot where we took that picture she noticed that we had had our backs to a cairn, a Appalachian trail sign, and a double white blaze that we missed because of the picture taking. Ughhh!! So it could have been worse than a half mile out of the way. So that sucked. And just to add to that, and to break up the monotony of a perfectly level trail, the MATC decided to place the lean to way off the trail on a nice steep climb away from any convenient water source. I know, the MATC today did not route the trail here, but you gotta give credit to somebody.","Trail head, Monson

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538991,"Day 18- The bubble left this morning for the next lean to about nine miles away. We most likely won't see any of them for a long time. I woke up at about noon. I don't know how that happened but I'm glad it did. Tonight's group consists of a young couple, 18 years old each. They're hiking till the fall semester of college begins. And then there's a French woman who teaches college level courses in Daytona, Florida.It's been virtually non-stop conversation all day, which really drives me batty. There comes a point at which it is okay to NOT talk and have some quiet time. Today we ate our pound of Cabot extra sharp cheddar cheese from Pete's Place. We ate that with our grass-fed beef summer sausage. It was pretty much awesomeness. And of course we hiked the 300 miles from the shelter down to the river today so that we could soak our feet in the water while the sun was shining. Our goal tomorrow is to stop before Bald Mountain. We're taking three and a half days from now to hike into Caratunk. We'll resupply at the Sterling Inn and then the following morning is the ferry across the Kennebec River. The ferry is only available across the 400 foot wide river from 9am-11am. After that the guide book starts to show more steep ups and downs with mountains. I do not want to do any of them. Crying......Zero day reflections- You know what? If it weren't for the injury to my heel, this trail is finally becoming doable. I looked online for information regarding Achilles tendon injuries, and apparently runners get that injury fairly often. It suggested that it takes up to six weeks to heal! I'd love to stay in Monson for the the next six weeks but it is just barely out of our budget. Darn! We both feel like the 100 mile wilderness chewed us up and spit us out. And then barfed on us a little bit. But then we showered off and continued on, which would have been perfect if we weren't already bruised up. I do have to say that I have enjoyed being out here in the woods, but those moments mostly happen when we're finally at a shelter, no longer on the move. It's almost been three weeks on the trail and we still have not found the ever elusive ""trail legs."" I miss Poppy","Horseshoe Canyon lean to

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539001,"Day 19- This morning it felt good to put some distance away from the lean to and get down that trail. I was feeling a little bit better but still had to go slowly. It took us four hours to go the first three miles, when it would normally only take an hour and a half. So we got to the first river Ford of the day. We took our shoes off to cross. But before we got there Holly scouted ahead to the crossing, laid her pack down and came back to get carry mine for me. Normally this would throw off my manliness, but since my pack is lighter than here it didn't matter. After crossing we soaked our feet and had a snack. Two nobos met up with us and we exchanged town information and hostel recommendations. Then we hit the trail again. Although I was feeling better, I had to take breaks more often because of the pain. My mood went south. I looked at the map and noticed an obscure gravel logging road in two miles. We decided to see if we could get cell reception and call out to the Sterling Inn in Caratunk. We got reception but I had to hike up the dirt road to get it. The guy answered the phone, I told him we wanted a shuttle out to town, he said he wasn't familiar with the roads we were on. So that sucked. Annoyed, we hiked on knowing that tomorrow had a nice two mile climb mountain for us. I told Holly that I didn't want to quit and that if we shuttled back to Monson that it was the end of the trail for me. She said that was okay with her. After about a mile we decided to turn around and call out to Shaw's in Monson. They were there within half an hour. We shuttled into town, got a room at Shaw's, and are returning to Florida so that my Achilles tendon can heal properly, without roots, without rocks or mountains or miles.I am actually content with my decision. I do not regret stopping because A) we gave it one heck of a try, B) we didn't quit when we originally wanted to. We gave it at least one more week, and C) if I keep hiking with this injury it will get worse and force us off the trail. So I'd rather stop hiking on my own terms instead of screwing up my leg instead. Quitting is cheaper than an ambulance ride if you know what I mean. So we fly out in four days and begin the next big adventure but on much more level terrain.Thanks to all of you who followed us and encouraged us. I am more let down by the idea of letting you guys down more than I am myself.","Marble Brook Rd.

Jonathan & Holly Hargus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540367,"Well Holly and I have been up and down, back and forth, and inside out with our current feelings and future goals concerning the trail. But to make a short story even shorter, we have decided not to give up on hiking the Appalachian trail but to section hike it for now. So hopefully within a month I will be healed of my tendonitis, which is coming along nicely, and fly to Asheville North Carolina to be shuttled into Hot Springs to continue our southbound journey. Ending in Georgia, we will begin preparing our own shelter for the winter, and beekeeping equipment for next spring. I've been an apprentice of my father-in-law in the bees solidly for 3 1/2 years now, on and off for the last 14 years. Thanks to him and Frail Angel, Holly and I feel ready to step out on our own now. I'll update when I have dates and times for starting in Hot Springs in the Appalachian trail, the next generation.
Oh! And though I hate the phrase 'shout out,' I'm going to use it here and give a shout out to our friends who are still on the trail going strong, or going weak but hey they're doing it. Anyways, in random order: Whisky, Acorn, Jolly Rancher, Bubbles/pancakes (depending on the day), Brightside, and of course, Karma. You guys are the part of the trail we miss the most.","Florida
