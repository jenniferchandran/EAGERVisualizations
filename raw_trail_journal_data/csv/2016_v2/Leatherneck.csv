Leatherneck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/449282,"Given that I am still working and not ready for retirement, I will not be able to take off the five or six months necessary for a thru hike. So, I have decided that a 30 day ""rehearsal"" hike would be possible now, in preparation for a thru hike post retirement. My plan is to step off at Springer Mountain the morning of 27 April 2014, and head north for 30 days.",,View Entry,"Apr 12, Sat",0

Arrangements have been made for me to be picked up at the North Springs MARTA Station later that afternoon, taking me to the Hiker Hostel at Dohlonega, GA for the evening. The next morning the Hiker Hostel staff will deliver hikers to the top of Springer Mountain. Still getting my hiking gear in order. Plan on making one more run to REI this morning to pick up a new backpack cover that fits my GoLite backpack. In the past I have used my REI backpack cover that I originally purchased for my REI Timberland, a much larger external frame pack. As far as I know, I have everything else I need to take care of my needs for a late April thru May hike from Springer to...however far I can hike in 30 days. Also have printed off a copy of my Smokey Mountains back country hiking permit to take along with me. With no rain in the forecast here at home, I plan on setting up my Lunar Solo tent in the yard today and spraying it down with the hose to see if there are any leaks. I sealed it a few years ago, so it's best to make sure there are no leaks before hitting the trail.",,View Entry,"Apr 19, Sat",0

Also thought I'd try some compression sacks for my sleeping bag and extra clothes. I've been looking for a way to attach my cell phone to my hiking stick to take photos creating more distance from the shot. Purchased a GearTie.

Later this morning I will take down my tent after having tested it yesterday with the water hose for leaks. No leaks! I will have to get everything packed and see what the weight of my pack will be with everything I am planning to carry; without water and fuel for my stove. Early next Saturday morning I will be catching a cab to the Greyhound Station for my trip to Atlanta. It will be tough saying goodbye to my wife and daughters for a month.

Leatherneck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/451273,"Attempted to pack up last night and it seems I have more gear than I had expected. My 4200 in3 Go Lite is to capacity. This is a good indication that I am taking more gear than I need, so will do some soul searching tonight and see if I can eliminate a few things. At this point I have decided not to take my running pants that I planned on taking for additional warmth; will just take my rain pants and merino wools for sleeping and the unexpected cold front. Also, I think I will leave behind my MSR 100 oz./3.0L H2O Reservoir and just go with two 1.0L Gatorade bottles that I will carry in the external mesh pockets of my backpack. I should be able to ""camel up"" at water sources, then 2 full Gatorade bottles should be enough to get me to the next source of water. Since my sleeping bag, tent and sleeping mat are fixed, I will be scrutinizing my clothes and food bags tonight. With a late April start, I will be able to get by with fewer warm clothing and water sources should be plentiful with the Spring rainy season. After tonight's going over, the next step for me is to pack up and weigh all my gear.",,View Entry,"Apr 22, Tue",0

Finally packed up and weighed my pack and waist pack for the first time...which came in at 25.3 lbs. w/o water or fuel. I was pleased. With fuel and water I should still be under 30 lbs. since I am for the first time going to experiment with two 1 qt. Gatorade bottles for a total of 64 ozs. This is less than the 100 oz. Camelbak and additional 1L bottle that I normally carry when I hike.

At 0235 I decided to call since he was 5 min. late and my bus departure time was 0340. No answer...called again 10 min. later...again no answer. my wife and I decided it would be best if I drove myself to the bus station and park the car and she would arrange to pick it up later.

Leatherneck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/452259,"Woke early this morning at the Hiker Hostel. For the first time used the ""red"" light on my headlamp to grab my towel and head for the shower without disturbing the three others sleeping in the bunk room. After showering, I grabbed the rest of my gear and headed out to the front porch to organize my gear before breakfast at 0730. I hear Leigh, one of the hostel owners, in the kitchen starting to prepare breakfast. After this entry I am going to see if coffee is ready. Today is what I call AT + 1, or the first day of my 30 days on the AT. With the majority of thru-hikers having already started their hikes in March and early April, I expect that there will be plenty of shelter space along the way, and on those rainy days and nights, will be a nice luxury to enjoy and at least make things less miserable. Today is the first day of my rehearsal hike. The Hiker Hostel arranged transportation and dropped six of us at the parking lot about .9 miles north of the starting point. We then hiked south to the Appalachian Trail (AT) southern terminus...uphill I might add. After a short rest and calling home to announce my arrival I told my wife and daughters I was ready to hike north. Tough day considering that I have not hiked for a year and that was a single overnight and hiking two days. I ended up hiking past the shelter .5 miles down into Hightower Gap before I realized I has passed up the shelter. I turned around only because other were no water sources nearby except back at Hawk Mountain Shelter. When they say a ""GAP"", that means a low point between two mountain. So it was all uphill from Hightower Gap back to the turnoff for the shelter. After I settled in, a group of five hikers filed into the shelter area looking for a place to set up their tents. As they walked past me I greeted them with ""Gentlemen"", but as the third hiker walked past, he stood out because he was a really big guy wearing a camouflaged hiking kilt, I could not help myself by greeting him with ""Ma'am"" as he passed. He took about three more steps...stopped...turned to me and said, ""did you just call me ""ma'am"", which I said ""yes"". Luckily he turned away in what I thought was ""disbelief"" and kept walking with his buddies. Later that evening, a couple of his buddies came by the shelter where I was and asked if I was the one that called their buddy ""Ma'am"", and they added that he has a good sense of humor, but that the big guy definitely has anger issues. They also added that they were all X-Army Rangers. I decided to stay clear of him that night and if we did cross paths I would address him as ""Sir"". There was a brief shower, but it cleared up in about 30 min. Tomorrow should be a good day but heavy thunderstorms are expected. Thanks to my wife and daughters for supporting this thing that I just have to do.","Hiker Hostel

Leatherneck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/453090,"Pulled into Gooch Mountain Shelter and there were already a trio of thru hikers there planning to let the storm pass that evening. The storms started in the mid-west heading east with tornadoes and ended up killing about 35 people before it lost power after passing though Georgia. That evening around mid-night they were hitting us. The severe winds, lightning, thunder and rain hit our camp. We were all probably thinking the same thing ""I hope a tree does not fall on the shelter"". The storm passed and we were able to get back to sleep. There were two father/daughter teams there that night. One of the girls got sick in the loft area of the shelter. I asked myself how I would feel if it were my daughter, and I got up to pour some of my drinking water on a cloth and offered it to her Dad. He said that he believed she was dehydrated from the long day of hiking and just needed some electrolytes. Just so happened that I had a tube of electrolyte tablets and gave them to him. He was very appreciative. I got up early the next morning and packed up in the dark so as to get an early start. As I was hiking that morning the rain started again so I put on my new, high speed Arc'teryx rain jacket that I had just purchased before the hike. I kept noticing things during the day like ""I wonder why the Velcro tabs have all this lint stuck in them"" and figured that it somehow happened while packed in my backpack; then I noticed when looking down that the seams were sewn a little irregularly and thought to myself that in the reviews of my jacket they raved about the meticulous craftsmanship, so maybe the reviews were a bit exaggerated; it also was not breathing well (i.e., I was perspiring inside more than I had hoped), an then...as I was going to place something into one of my two vertical chest pockets, I noticed that the pockets were not vertical but were lower and horizontal!!! Finally I said to myself ""hey, this is not my jacket""! So I figured that I must have left my blue jacket at the shelter and I must have packed up the ""Dad's"" blue jacket in the dark. I was little disappointed for three reasons; the jacket was not breathing as well as I hoped, the water from the rain was not balling up and rolling off like I expected from my Arc'teryx $375 jacket, and that due to my error I no longer had an Arc'teryx $375 Gore-Tex jacket! So if the ""Dad"" ever reads this trail journal and wants to exchange jackets, he can contact me via this journal and I will will gladly pay for postage to mail the two jackets to their rightful owners.","Hawk Moumtain Shelter

Leatherneck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/453166,"Headed north to Lance Creek around 8AM, still fretting that I no longer was the proud owner of an Arc'teryx rain jacket. There was plenty of rain and high winds expected tonight, so I set up my tent in a location that looked liked flooding would not be an issue. I pressed the tent stakes deep into the soil and placed large rocks over them to help ensure the winds would not pull them from the ground. I made it thru the rain that night, but due to me getting my Lunar Solo tarp tent as close to the ground as possible there was very little air circulation that is needed with these single walled tarp tents. What happens without adequate circulation is condensation builds up and the interior still gets very wet along the the occupant and all his gear. Rain stopped around 6am, got up and hung much of my wet gear from nearby trees with little result. Packed up and headed north.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Leatherneck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/452374,"I will have to conserve power on my cell phone as I hike because I was unable to make any updates to my journals for the past couple days. Hiked up and over Blood Mountain (4450' elevation) in the rain. Rained pretty hard up and down the mountain. Made it to Neels gap, and decided to get a cabin that night so that I could spread my gear out and get it dryed. Stayed over at Blood Mountain Cabins. Not a bad deal for $60. The cabin was nice and I could lay out all my gear. They had food for sale in the office; of which I bought a pizza and a can of ravioli's. The best part of the deal is that they did my laundry for me at no charge. Not sure where I will camp tonight. Will have to work around where I can find water and potential campsites. When I was unpacking all my gear, guess what was in the bottom of my pack? MY BLUE ARC'TERYX GORE-TEX RAIN JACKET! I was initially very happy for about two seconds and then the thought came to me that ""Dad"" was without his rain jacket. I convinced myself that he was probably getting off the trail since his daughter was ill, so I felt less bad. I asked at Neels Gap Mountain Crossings Walasi-Yi Center the next morning if anyone was looking for a blue Gore-Tex jacket. I ended up mailing it home. So if ""Dad"" reads the journal message, I hope your daughter is feeling better, and I am so sorry for taking your rain jacket. Please contact me and I will mail the jacket back to you. By the way, the rain does really ball up well on my Arc'teryx rain jacket, so I highly recommend it as a very good rain jacket that repels water and also breathes well.","Lance Creek

Leatherneck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/453183,"Headed north out of Neels Gap and decided that the next shelter, Whitley Gap Shelter, was not that inviting. You would have to walk east off the AT for 1.2 miles to get to it, and I even think it was described as a steep trail down. The water source from there was an additional .3 miles downhill. I don't think so! So I kept going towards the next water source which was about 50 yards off trail for resupply. After filtering my water (by the way I thank my wife for buying me the Sawyer Water Filter, which is much lighter than my MSR pump type filter and is working well) I hiked on to the next campsite I came across, which was at Hogpen Gap. Made my Raman Noodles, had a candy bar and continued to set up camp. The evening was windy and cool, but there was no rain. Woke up to a cool 48 degrees and packed everything up. So nice to pack up dry gear! Had two pop tarts for breakfast headed north. Will try to get in 10 miles today. Trying to carry less water and resupply more often. These ""ups"" are really slowing me down. ","Neels Gap

Leatherneck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/453346,"Made it to Blue Mountain Shelter this afternoon. Walked up to the shelter and there were two older German gentlemen already there and settled in. I talked with them a bit and mentioned that their Chancelor was visiting the White House today, which they did not seem interested in discussing. I asked what they thought of Russia and their actions in the Ukraine. One of the gentlemen said he believed that Russia was partly correct by doing so and that the Europeans were partly wrong because they were too overbearing in trying to Europeanize the Ukraine. I could see we had different perspectives and I added that I believed Russia was wrong in the manner in which there were ""protecting Russian citizens"" and if Putin was in the ""right"" why would he send in his forces covering their faces and no indication of Russian markings on their uniforms. The conversation ended there and we did not have any meaningful conversations after that. I am just making all kinds of friends out here.","Hogpen Gap

Leatherneck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/453449,"Arrived early to Tray Mountain Shelter. There were four thru hikers there. One that I camped with the previous night at Blue Mountain Shelter, a real speedster doing 20 mile days, and a young married couple that I had arrived with at about the same time back at Neels Gap, and the fourth was one of the Ridge Runners, Blue Eyes that helps maintain the trail and tries to ensure hikers adhere to the ""leave no trace"" method of hiking. The speedster, his trail name was ""Squirrel"" by the way, and the young married couple were departing to get in more miles that afternoon. With the next shelter being over seven miles away, and having already hiked 8.1 miles, I did not flintch in starting to unload my pack and get set up in this shelter. Shortly after the three hikers left, a female hiker rolled in and it ended up being the three of us there that night. Her trail name was ""Repack"". I ate my last Raman Noodles for dinner, so at least I would have an empty food bag to carry into Hiawassee tomorrow.","Blue Mountain Shelter

The driver, a retired steel mill worker out of Ohio dropped me off in the middle of town. I looked for a place to stay. Since I was feeling pretty beat up, I decided to take a zero day on Monday and stay in town an additional day to relax and take care of few things before getting back on the trail. Had dinner a Daniel's Steak House, which had an all you can eat buffet style set up. A good deal for a hungry hiker. Total without tip came to $11.60. The food was plentiful and very good.

Leatherneck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/453960,"Got up this morning and walked down to the laundry facility about a quarter mile away. While doing laundry, I noticed a Radio Shack so I replaced my watch battery which was getting low, and picked up a couple AAA lithium batteries for my AM/FM radio. I will say that my watch with altimeter is really useful to me as I am trudging up these mountains. I use it as a motivator as I try to go at least 20' in elevation before stopping to catch my breath. Some of these mountains are about 45 degree inclines for a mile. They are beating the heck out of me. Anyway, I find my altimeter very useful in letting me know how much more the pain will last before I reach the summit and can enjoy the down side. Also, I enjoy my radio in keeping up with the news so I can question our foreign hikers with things like ""did you know your Chancelor was visiting the White House today""? After laundry and getting batteries, I went to the local grocery store to stock up on enough food for five days. The next resupply for me will be Franklin, NC. After purchasing the portable charger I walked up the main street to a Subway for lunch. On the way I saw a Verizon store and made a decision to go in and purchase a portable power charger for my cell phone. I will be in a little hot water for this because my Mother-In-Law had previously given me a portable power charger, and my wife tried to convince me to take it with me. I decided not to take it because of the extra weight. I thought I could smooth things over a bit with my MIL by purchasing and sending from the trail a Mother's Day card since next Sunday is Mother's Day. After mailing the cards, I headed to the library to update my journals and try to correct typos. Tomorrow morning back on the trail.","Hiawassee

Prefer the Shelters because they have level surfaces and if it rains you are better protected. Arrived in NC! Camped that evening with CPaw (Cincinnati Bearcats) and Lightning. We set up our tents, made dinner and hung our bear bags in nearby trees. A few other hikers walked into camp in the early evening and set up their tents nearby. At about 2AM I heard a noise that sounded like a bear might be taking swats at my bear bag hanging from a tree about 25 yards behind my tent. I crawled out of my tent and shined my head lamp into the woods to see if I came across any ""reflective"" eyes. After scanning the area for 3 or 4 minutes, I climbed back in my tent and heard the noise again.

Arrived at 3PM at Standing Indian Shelter, but did not have the energy to hike to the next shelter. Most shelters have a privy and a stream to draw water. Most shelters also have bear cables to hang your food bags, but if not, you have to throw a line over a tree branch to hang your food bag far enough off the ground and far enough from the truck of the tree so that bears can't reach it.

I responded and they (Red Hat and The Late John Lenin) said they had a message for me. They said that No Hurry had my cooking kit, which I must have left behind that morning when packing up. I thanked them and then back-tracked a mile down hill and stopped at Carter Gap Shelter where I remembered No Hurry and her husband said they were stopping that night. We had all stayed over at Standing Indian Shelter the pervious night before and my cooking kit ended up next to their tarp....yadayadayada...I neglected to pack it up with me.

Woke up at 0625 and began packing up being certain I was not leaving anything behind. Lightning and CPaw were also getting up and packing their backpacks. I was the first to hit the trail at 0708. The first big obstacle was Albert Mountain that morning. According to the profile map it is about 5200' in elevation and the last couple hundred yards are very steep requiring the use of your hands to climb up and over the rocks. It did not disappoint. I did not get any photos of the steepest parts because I was too busy trying to breathe. I made it up and over by 1130AM and proceeded down the opposite side. At about 1145 the rain began. I stopped to put on my rain jacket and place my backpack cover over my pack. It rained all afternoon but I made good time only due to the declining elevation. My goal was to get into Franklin that evening so I could get to the post office before it closed at noon on Saturday. Got into Winding Stair Gap late afternoon. As I was pulling out my Thru-Hiker's Companion to find a telephone number for a local motel that would come out to pick me up, there were three girls that I had just met up the trail and they asked if I needed a ride. I said yes and mentioned that another hiker past a little while back should be coming down the trail and he too may be interested. He also accepted and we placed our packs and trekking poles in their cars trunk and we were off. Both of us were a little surprised that these three very attractive girls, two from Lithuania and one from Cuba, would offer us old smelly hikers a ride into town. But there were just very nice people and wanted to help out some hikers because they too were hiking enthusiasts from Florida visiting the Appalachian Trail.

Been having trouble breathing since back in Hiawassii. Could not sleep that night and moved from the bunk bed to the couch and sat up trying to sleep. Used everything available in my med kit, inhaler, nasal spray, Sudafed, to keep my air passages open. I should have gone to the ER that evening, but waited until morning. After I got up and started to move around, my breathing improved and the raspy/wispy sound from my lungs upon exhaling dissipated. Having been diagnosed with EIB (Exercise Induced Broncospasms or Exercised Induced Asthma) just last year, I suspected this is what was going on, except more severe than I have experienced. My Doctor said he could not cure me, but the next step could be to prescribe Pregnazone.

It's always nice recognizing a familiar voice. They made room and I prepared my sleeping pad and sleeping bag. Too late and too tired to cook anything. Tried to get to sleep, but there was a snorer in the shelter. This normally does not brother me, but this guy was so loud and continuous throughout the night I could not fall asleep...maybe got 90 minutes of sleep.

When climbing up and over the mountain the best I could do when resting was to block the wind and rain by standing behind a tree, but for the most part there was no where to go to get out of the rain. On the backside of the mountain, my pace slowed to a crawl to do everything I could do to avoid slipping and falling off the trail or slipping or falling onto a rock. Sometimes the trail is only a foot wide and a wrong step could put you in a vertical free fall falling a couple hundred feet from your current elevation.
Discovered that Greyhound does not operate out of Gatlinburg. A fellow hiker ""CPaw"" said his wife is picking him up on Friday at Fontana Dam and heading north west to Cinncinatti. He offered to drive me to the Greyhound Station in Knoxville. This will cut my hike short by four days, but eliminate transportation difficulties getting to Knoxville from Gatlinburg. An offer too good to pass up. Besides, with the rain I walked through today and with more in the forecast is less than inviting.

Shortly after he walked down the road dark clouds slid over the western mountain range and the sky did what it does best; it began pouring rain. Soon there after, his wife arrived and we packed up the car and headed down the winding road towards Knoxville. Since it was early afternoon we stopped at a local BBQ spot his wife had noticed on her way to Fontana Dam. It was the least I could do to offer to buy lunch and it turned out to be some really good BBQ. After lunch we headed in Knoxville and they pulled in front of the Greyhound Station. Before I could say farewell and walk into the bus station his wife presented me with a box full of homemade Peanutbutter Cookies, and brownies, candy bars, bottle water and other assorted snacks to hold me over for the duration of a 14 hour bus ride to St. Louis, arriving at 0630 Saturday morning. The bus was on time and my wife was there to meet me. My folks had come by the house in the morning to watch our daughters so that they would not have to get up so early on Saturday morning for a ride to and from St. Louis. My hike was pretty much what I expected, but much more difficult than I thought for me to climb the mountains. Next year I plan to get back out on the trail when my daughters go on summer vacation. In an effort to ""lighten up"", I may try a tarp next year instead of a tent and a summer weight sleeping bag versus my 20 degree bag. That should help some.","Fontana Dam

Leatherneck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503785,"My wife and daughters dropped me off at Rt. 28/Fontana Dam Marina at 11:30AM. We took a few photos, said our goodbyes, and I headed north towards Fontana Dam. Arrived at the Fontana Dam Hilton and took a short break. There were two other hikers there, one recovering from an ankle injury and they other taking a break for a few days. Got back on the trail and encountered my first black bear at about 2:00PM. We startled each other at about 10 yards distance. Looked like a mama bear in that she was not as large as a male, but plenty filled out and not an adolescent. She bolted away about 10 feet, stopped and turned around to look back at me, then continued to run off into the woods. Later that afternoon, ran across another female bear, under almost the same conditions and same results. As the sun was setting and I was still a few miles from Mollies Ridge Shelter, I ran across another mama bear, this time with two or three cubs. As I rounded a corner on the trail, her cubs were already up a tree and she was standing on her hind legs with her front paws up on that tree looking directly at me. I was about 25 yards away. When I have come across bears with cubs up a tree in the past, I have backed away out of sight, waited a few minutes and then continued my hike to find that the bear and her cubs were down the tree and no where in sight. This time as I rounded the corner again, I see the mother and her cubs still in the same area just milling around. The mother noticed me again, her cubs again scurried up the same tree, and again the mother stood on her hind legs supporting her front paws up on the tree. This time there was a lot of ""gruffing"" sounds while she slapped her left claws on the tree. The tree was about 20"" in diameter, and it sounded hollow as her claws struck the tree and it echoed throughout the area. She was obviously agitated and was sending me a warning to back off. This time I decided to see if I could scare her off from my distance of about 25 yards. I retrieved my trusty emergency whistle and exhaled into it as hard as I could...she just looked at me and gave me another round of ""gruffing"" and claw slapping. That didn't work. I then took out my head lamp and turned on the red flashing lights. I figured this would really scare her as it was starting to get dark and the effects would send her and her cubs running deep into the woods. Well...she again just looked at me and gave me the same routine. It was getting late and I was making zero progress, so I felt I needed to keep moving. The trouble with continuing north is that the trail would come within about 10 yards of the tree that the bears were making their stand in and I already felt that the 25 yards distance was a little too close for comfort. The terrain on the opposite side of the trail as the bears was essentially impassable, so I had to stay on the trail as I moved forward. So as I approached she repeated her ""gruffing"" and claw slapping routine, I sang a soothing tune to attempt to show her I was not a threat. I sang what I called the ""I'm coming thru, I'm coming thru"" tune as I moved toward her. Her demeanor did not change as I approached and passed her position, but all I knew is that she did not charge me. As I moved past and away, I was somewhat relieved, but still a little shaken at what could have happened. I figured she would not pursue me at this point since she would not want to leave her cubs. It was now completely dark and I continued to move forward with my head lamp lighting the trail and blazes. Before I arrived at the shelter, I heard sounds off to my left just beyond the brush. My first thought was that it was another bear, but the sound it made was noticeably different. At 9:40PM I arrived at Mollies Ridge Shelter. It is a large shelter and was pretty crowed. Using my red light I found an opening on the second level and began to unpack my gear and prepare my sleeping space. A long first day back on the trail...too long for me on my first day back out on the trail.","Fontana Dam Marina Rt. 28

Leatherneck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513318,"In the morning, I heard other hikers talking about the wild hogs in the area. That is probably what I had heard the previous evening when approaching the shelter. Departed the shelter at 10AM feeling very weak. Lots of wheezing and coughing as I continued my hike north. Arrived at the Russell Field Shelter at about 1PM. It took me 3 hours to go less than 3 miles. My only course of action would be to stop at this shelter and get as much rest as I could before the next morning. Slept that afternoon in the shelter. When I woke up, I was told by incoming hikers that I was ""panting"" while sleeping, which probably meant my breathing was made up of short quick breaths. Not sure what was going on with my breathing, but I was concerned, especially because I also had very little strength. Did not feel I could prepare a cooked meal, I just ate a power bar and prepared to bed down for the evening. I did fall asleep at dusk, but had difficultly breathing while lying on my back. I was also experiencing uncontrollable shaking and my breathing was shallow. Maybe I was using my inhaler too much. I had to sit up in order to get a decent breath, and supported myself on my elbows most of the night. Everyone else was sleeping, and I am was getting very concerned that I would not be able to go on the next morning; I did not know what to do. Since there was an open field nearby (hence Russell ""Field"" Shelter) and I noticed a hiker at this shelter had a SPOT personal GPS, my thoughts were to wait until morning and ask him to activate his emergency feature for a medivac. I knew I could not hike any further north, and I was too far from my starting point to head back south. When dawn arrived I asked the hiker with the SPOT if he would activate the emergency feature. Since he had no idea what I had been going thru, he hesitated to do so and explained that he would have to stay with me until the helicopter arrived and that could take several hours. A few hikers gathered around and explained that there was a trail right off the side of this shelter (Russell Field Trail) that was basically downhill for five miles leading to a campground. I decided to give it a try since my options were limited. As I got dressed, I could not even put on my sock without feeling very weak accompanied with heavy shallow breathing. After finally getting dressed, most hikers had departed on their hikes, I had given my word to them that I would not stay at the shelter that night alone. So I started down the trail...this time heading West instead of North...feeling quite defeated. Finally made it to Cades Cove Campground 4 hours later. Hitched a ride back to the motel in Maryville, TN, the same motel that my family and I stayed at two nights ago. Got cleaned up and walked across the street to get something to eat. Even walking on flat terrain was a challenge. Was out of breath walking 100 yards on a flat surface and not carrying a backpack. Could this be the result of my EIB and attempting to hike the AT?","Mollies Ridge Shelter
