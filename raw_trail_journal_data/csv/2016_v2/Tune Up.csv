Tune Up,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515846,"    March can not come soon enough. I have been more busy the past two months then the rest of the year combined. Work is consuming 90% of my time. Fall is finally here in the Carolinas and I am in need of a trip to the mountains to get my fix for a month or two. I think I am going to spend my birthday weekend in the Mountains on a good hike.     My gear is constantly evolving. I have decided to ditch my jetboil for a super light Snow Peak LiteMax, it will knock off about 12 ounces. I also ordered a sleeping bag from Zpacks, it is a down bag that weigh's in at 13 ounces, this time knocking off a pound and half. I ordered a Ghost Whisper jacket. It's a 7.2 ounce jacket, and to find the color I wanted, which I found out was a limited run, but I was able to find it online from a company in Spain. Which lead to me almost having a heart attack. Me and my buddy went to a Carolina Panthers game. We woke up late for tailgating and decided to grab a bottle of vodka to speed up our being late. We make it to the game, the vodka definitely did it's trick, the beer was going down way to good. We ended up at a bar after the game, and making it home late. So, the next morning I wake up a little hazy about the events the night before. I get in my truck and go to get some gas and my card is declined. The first thing that comes to mind is ""Shit there is no way I spent that much money last night, I should have pleanty of money in the bank. The good news is it turned out my bank saw a purchase in Spain where I had ordered my jacket and froze my account. So my almost heart attack was not after all.     I've decided to travel down to Amicalola Falls on March 14th, hike the approach trail on the 15th and then start the trail on the 16th. I'm going to make my reservations to stay at Amicalola Falls Lodge for the two nights I am down there. Like I said March can not come soon enough. Tune Up","

Tune Up,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510347,"I'm a 15 year veteran of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard. I spent 15 years traveling and seeing the world, all seven continents, every major ocean, lived in numerous countries. I was injured in the line of duty and left with several pain in the ass disabilities. I've since learned that its the abilities we still have that are what matter, not the ones we have lost or are impaired. I've learned to live with pain, to work through it, and more than anything to use it as motivation that nothing is given and everything is earned in life.My Trail name. In 2000 my Brother was hiking the Appalachian Trail. I was in the Middle East on a contract and needed a break. My team I was working with at the time would refer to a quick trip back home as a ""Tune Up"". During my ""Tune Up"" I visited my brother at trail days and while explaining my break to some of the current hikers, I was given the trail name ""Tune Up"".Growing up in North Carolina, the mountains have been an escape for myself for as long as I can remember. I love everything thing about them, the views, the smell, culture, people, the challenge they demand of you to explore them. I am finally at a point in my life that I can take six months off and enjoy myself. I look forward to the challenge, the adventure, and the new friendships that will be forged while on the trail.

Tune Up,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512406,"                         I love this crazy, tragic,                           Sometimes almost magic,                            Awful, beautiful lifeIf there were a song to describe how I feel most days this one definitely does it. I am not complaining by any means, I ask for and welcome every aspect of the life I live. It's taken years for my mother to realize that I don't have a death wish, I just enjoys the things that make my heart pound so fast I think it might rip out of my chest. That is when you truly know your living life to the fullest. These adventures, situations, or moments I welcome and most of the time crave usually find me. I'm curious to see what I run into or find while on the trail. I also absolutely enjoy the outdoors, there is nothing better than hiking a trail not knowing what is around the corner. A slight wind rustling the leaves, birds singing, rain, or thunder rolling in the distance. It's all music and the kind that soothes the soul. My favorite summer memory this year is watching the sun go down and camping on Max Patch Bald. Me and my daughter Sarah camped at the summit there this summer, and I must say it is hands down my favorite place in the mountains. If you have never herd of Max Patch Bald ease do a Google images search of it. I can not wait to hike across it again next spring and camp again on the summit of it. A quick note about gear. If you have never herd of the website ProMotive.com take the time to visit it search the different teams and see if you qualify. All veterans do. So if you don't and have a family member or close friend it is very worth your while to talk them into signing up. The website is the top brands in the outdoor industry that have are giving you a Pro discount on their gear. An example I recently bought a Big Agnes tent from REI that was 30% off. I'm taking it back what I can get it for on ProMotive.com is so much less. I am definitely a gear junkie, I enjoy helping others when it comes to gear so if u have question, ease ask. Tune Up","

Tune Up,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517966,"   Winter is finally here. That means as this season is nearing its finish, I'll be stepping off to start the trail. I've made all of my major purchases when it comes to gear. I still have to train with my new pack and make my biggest decision for the trail. I have a 90lb Lab, Alabama Clyde the Greatest is his name. Clyde has been hiking with me in the past, he is really good about listening to me when he is off leash as long as there is no water around. If there is water, all bets are off and he is in it. I can't make up my mind about bringing him? My biggest concern is snakes, I hike a lot and take Clyde with me. Clyde has already walked up to a snake and was bitten right on the bridge of the nose, and then he tried to play the Copperhead that had just bitten him. Clyde luckily made it through that incident just fine. That's my dilemma at the moment.    My next phase of preparation is to get my mail drops figured out and ready to go. I don't plan on mailing myself food for the entire trail, but I do plan on sending most of my meals for the first month, but also mailing myself lots, and lots of snacks for most of the trail. I'll keep this entry a short one for now. I'm going to try and make an effort to get on here more now that time to start is quickly approaching.Tune Up","
