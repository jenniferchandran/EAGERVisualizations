Meredith ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504185,"The final decision was made last night and I will be attempting a thru hike in 2016. This will be a gift as I celebrate my 45th birthday and sending off my youngest child to college. He just happens to be attending a college about 7 miles from the AT. If I can time the hike right, he will be able to meet me and we can spend some time together (at least a hot shower and a good meal for me, right?)",,Springer Mountain,"Jul 07, Tue",0
Meredith ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504188,"Now that the final decision has been made, I was anxious to get outside and get in an official prep hike. I loaded my backpack with a 10 pound weight and two Nalgenes full of water and hit the pavement. Yes, it was pavement as I am in town today and did an urban hike to the local park. The weight of the pack, sand bag, and water totaled a bit over 16 pounds. I was surprised at how much the additional weight slowed my pace. I usually walk the 12 mile route in 2.75 hours. Today's pace started off just fine but I found myself slowing and the final time was an additional 40 minutes. I was also surprised at the cravings that developed on the return trip. The need for sugar was strong. Luckily, I was able to find some ripe black raspberries in the park and somewhat appeased that urge.I have a few extra pounds I would like to lose and have been struggling for about a year with no success (despite hiking, biking, kayaking, 21 Day Fix, etc). I am hoping that adding weight to a pack will help me over this plateau and help drop my weight.",,1st offical training hike,"Jul 07, Tue",0
Meredith ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504193,I spent this spring learning how to dehydrate and package gluten free foods that will be appropriate for the AT. I have some good ideas of what will work for me.I've had a few practice outings at Philmont and Northern Tier and am comfortable with trail food and the easy prep. I think the tricky part will be finding gluten free foods in trail towns. My idea is to do a lot of prepackaging for food drops and have my family ship my boxes as I need them.I will be doing more research and prepping in the next 6 months.,,GF Food Prep,"Jul 07, Tue",0
Meredith ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507523,"While on vacation in NOVA, I made a quick (ok, not so quick) stop in Harper's Ferry. I have been holding off sending in my Conservancy application because I wanted to do it in person. I was so excited I was tongue tied and stumbled over my words. The volunteer probably thought I was a nutjob. I managed to get my membership, an AT wall map, and my official AT planning guide.My sojourn on the AT wasn't as long as I would have liked but I did get to walk it from the Conservancy across the Shenandoah bridge and back - about 2 miles.I am eagerly awaiting the next time I am there - during my thru-hike.",,AT Conservancy,"Jul 18, Sat",0
Meredith ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507459,"I took a spontaneous trip to CO so I could get in some conditioning hikes at altitude and with a change in elevation. The first hike was a simple acclimation hike and consisted of 4 miles in Cheyenne Canon. The 4 mile hike was easy and I had no problems with the altitude.I took a 5 mile urban hike that afternoon and had a bit of difficulty with catching my breath as quickly as I would have liked.My recovery time was surprisingly quick.All in all, acclimation day went well.",,Colorado Springs,"Jul 22, Wed",9
Meredith ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507462,"First long solo hike! I headed off to Dome Rock trail and was ready for an adventure. It was midweek and I had the park to myself for the first hour. The traffic consisted of solo horseback riders (all women by the way) who were on the shared trail. I was actually quite relieved to know the riders were there because I was in bear country - a fact I didn't really consider when I jumped in the car and took off for the backcountry that morning - and I was counting on the horses to frighten any bears that might be hanging around.This hike was a big step for me. It was a fairly long backcountry hike in unknown terrain. I needed the reassurance that I could hike on my own. I needed to prove to myself that I could do it. I needed to put the wilderness classes, the research, the desire to hike by myself to the test. I gave myself an A- for the day!! I had to take points off because I was so relaxed I forgot to take more than one photo of the Dome!!! The trail ranged from easy to difficult, requiring crossing the stream 6 times, climbing over rock outcroppings, and bushwacking the tamarack. I loved every step of it.",,Dome Rock,"Jul 23, Thu",15
Meredith ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507463,"With a difficult hike/climb on the books for Saturday and after a 15 miler the previous day, I planned on two short hikes for Friday. The morning hike consisted of an easy walk through the Paint Mines. The scenery is quite lovely and well worth the drive to Calhan. As a Trekkie, my first impression of the Mines was that it would make a wonderful backdrop for an alien planet. Then my conservationist side took over and was happy that the Mines are preserved as well as they are. This is a must see and I will return some day to watch the sunrise or sunset over the mines.The afternoon hike was on a local trail and was cut short due to a barricade near the Air Force Academy. It was disappointing but still a nice trail in the northern end of the city.",,Paint Mines,"Jul 24, Fri",8.50
Meredith ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507465,"One mile up with a grade ranging from 41-65% - the Manitou Incline would be the last of my hikes for this trip. My sister and I were up early and at the base of the incline by 7am. Fifty-six minutes later I reached the summit! I am quite happy with my climb time since I am a lowlander and that was my second time on the incline. My inaugural hike was December 28, 2014 when I reached the summit in about 90 mins with temps hovering around -10 degrees.Needless to say, hiking it in July makes for a different experience. 
I pretty much took off and left my sister behind (sorry about that) and just climbed. There was another woman who was matching my every step and we fell into conversation. It was a natural, easy companionship. Before we knew it we had passed the dreaded false summit and were mere steps away from the top. It was a delightful and enjoyable climb.After reaching the summit and taking the obligatory picture, I decided to check on my Big Sis. She was still climbing and giving it her all. I (being the best little sister in the world) ran down 2-miles of the descent trail (the Barr Trail for those who know the area)to the point where people can opt to stop climbing the incline and walk down to the parking lot and rejoined the group on the ascent. I caught up with my sister and followed her as she summitted the incline. After a few moments of celebration, we headed down the trail and completed the four mile descent.By my estimation I completed 1.3 ascents of the Incline and 6 miles of descent. My Fitbit concurred. What a rockin' way to end a quick trip. A neat little happenstance - I met a couple of backpackers who had summitted Pikes Peak. Of course, I had to strike up a conversation. This young couple has already completed the PCT and the AT. They are living life and taking advantage of their youth. Oh, to have known the joys of hiking and backpacking when I was young.",,Manitou Springs,"Jul 25, Sat",9
Meredith ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507472,"Coming up with a trail name is going to be the worst part of planning this trip. I do not want to leave it to the wonderful people who will be in proximity of my hike. Nothing like having a stranger assign a moniker based on some random happenstance while hiking. Pee Butt. Booger Picker. Nimrod. Nope, I've gotta come up with a name.My husband thinks my name should be Stink Bug. Want to know why? I tend to flatulate (is that even a word?) when I go on long walks. I like to think of it as theme music. He simply thinks it's funny. I'm not sure I want to sign all of the registers as Stink Bug. Unless I can learn to draw a cute little critter.<-- that's a cute pic. Just think of all the things I could put that on: T-shirts for my family, bandana, stickers and/or patches for my gear.Hmmm.......",,The Name Game,"Jul 26, Sun",0
Meredith ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507634,"I took the BIG step today and told my immediate supervisor that I will be leaving in March and therefore will not be available to teach during Spring semester. I am in that gray are where excitement meets reality. Knowing that I won't be worrying about syllabi, attendance records, tests, or grades is great; knowing my income for the year will be cut in half is frightening. I am lucky to have a husband who is willing to foot the bill for my hike. I am glad I have seven months to work on cost saving strategies.",,Springer Mountain,"Jul 27, Mon",0
Meredith ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507674,"At this point the most frequent question I am asked is ""Are you going alone?"" The answer is ""No, I am not."" My cousin, Cade, is going with me. Here's a link to his blog: https://cadesappalachianadventure.wordpress.com/I am comforted knowing he will be on the trail. I am awed by his desire and dedication to the hike. I am thrilled to have companionship, especially in the early stages. I am nervous that I won't be able to keep up. I am fearful I might ruin his hike.My goals are:-to offer support -to offer encouragement -to be positive-to be strong-to enjoy-to acceptThis will be a challenge but I want both of us to complete the thru-hike. In reality, I would like for us to begin in Springer together and summit Katahdin together. Whatever happens in the middle, we will take in stride.",,FAQs,"Jul 28, Tue",0
Meredith ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508242,"Since I haven't hiked/camped/backpacked with my cousin and since he will be my AT partner, we decided to get together last week for some pre-AT bonding time. We each headed from our respective homes and met in Missouri for a three day backpacking trip on the Ozark Trail.   This was a last minute trip and we did as much planning as we could; this planning included looking at the OT website and reading about the trail. What a disappointment. The trail was completely overgrown and impassable in places. Our first foray was a 5 mile trek that ended with a walk back to the cars via farm roads and the highway. We simply could not hike through the poison ivy and poison sumac. After heading to the nearest town and purchasing bottles of IvyRest and TechNu, we headed for a hotel and lots of scrubbing.We rose early the next morning and drove to another section of the trail about 30 miles away. Same thing. Overgrown with the Poisons - this time poison oak joined the party. We were able to hike about 5 miles total on some short in-and-outs. We ended up hanging around the established campground and visiting with locals. I found it quite interesting that none of the locals could give us much information on the trail or trail maintenance. The trail registers were eerily blank as well.Whereas the hiking aspect of the trip was a total bust, my cousin and I did have the opportunity to catch up, use some of our new equipment, and work on establishing a trail relationship. With our disappointments and frustrations, we were able to see how each of us reacts to adverse situations. I was able to learn some family history and little bits of info about other cousins. It also appears that I will either have to binge on Game of Thrones episodes or books over the winter since we have already discussed most of the AT books, articles, etc that we have read.We'll meet again in December for a 5 day trek in Texas. This short trip made our AT journey even more real and I am pleased with how well we got along and am looking forward to next spring.
Edited: I am breaking out in a rash and oozing bumps on my legs and torso. My efforts to thwart the poisons have failed.",,Ozark Trail - 20 mile,"Jul 31, Fri",5
Meredith ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/509003,"I decided to mix it up a bit and chose to go on a biking adventure instead of hiking. After a three hour drive to the trailhead in Ankeny, my husband and I rode 21 miles to the High Trestle Bridge. I have a fear of bridges so this trip doubled as immersion therapy. We stayed on the bridge for about 45 minutes while waiting for the sun to set and the lights to come on. It was well worth the wait. The sculptures are beautiful and I found that I could walk and ride across the bridge with minimal anxiety. My greatest unease came when a young girl (about 5 years old) sat on the wall and dangled her legs over the edge. I was relaxed enough to take a couple of pics on the bridge so I am calling the trip a great success. The trail is not lit therefore it is not traveled by many at night and we had all 21 miles to ourselves as we rode back to Ankeny. It was a cool, starlit albeit moonless evening and we rode for long distances without headlamps. It was heavenly to just pedal along and listen to the frogs and cicadas. There is something soothing about a country trail at night and the ride was pleasant. Next time we take a similar adventure, we will take the tents and make it an overnight camping trip.",,High Trestle Trail,"Aug 02, Sun",45
Meredith ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512422,"Last weekend I took my son to college in Virginia. His school is within 10 miles of the AT so I made sure I found the time to take a short jaunt on the trail. I found an easy access point off the Blue Ridge Parkway and headed in. I wanted to summit one of the mountains and enjoy the hour I had to be on the trail and in the woods. The section I was on was close to a shelter and I took advantage of the opportunity to see a shelter up close and personal. They are definitely smaller than I had imagined but it is what it is. The area was littered with trash and toilet paper and I found my heart sinking at the obvious signs of human disrespect. Empty fuel canisters, foil food wrappers, paper towels tucked under partially burned wood - this is what greets the approaching hiker.After my initial disappointment over the condition of the shelter, I took a few pics and turned around to head back to the main trail and continue up the mountain. This plan quickly changed when, after taking a few steps, I saw my first black bear. It wasn't as close as the bear our hiking sister posted last week but it was about 50-75 feet away.I must not have heard or smelled me because it continued to root around, swiping at logs and pawing the ground. I could hear it breathing and I daresay I might have caught a whiff of bear scent on the breeze which was blowing in my direction. I stood there watching it for a full 5 minutes before I realized I had my camera and should be taking pictures. As soon as I turned on the camera, the sounds of the 'beep' and the telephoto lens opening alerted the bear to my presence. It gave me a dismissive look, grunted, and ran off along the trail.It was then that I realized I was crying. My heart has been aching for so long. Job worries, family issues, watching my son grow and begin a new life - it all weighs heavily on my heart. Seeing the bear and being able to soak in its majesty and simple beauty was a sweet salve to my aching soul. I remained on the trail, standing there, for a few more minutes, hoping for its return. In this I was disappointed. I returned to my car, summitting the mountain long forgotten, sat by the trailhead and the telltale white blaze and paused for awhile. Two thoughts were on a repeat loop in my head ""You are so ready for this"" and. ""Holy cow, you just saw a bear and all you have on you is a camera. What were you thinking?""",,Blue Ridge Mountains,"Sep 03, Thu",0
