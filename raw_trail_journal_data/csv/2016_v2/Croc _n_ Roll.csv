Croc 'n' Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523447,"After watching too many episodes of ""OJ vs the People"" in the hotel room while my dad and sister snored on Saturday night, I was finally standing at the rock arch outside of the Amicalola Visitor Center bright and early Sunday morning. Many people choose to start right at Springer Mountain instead of the additional 8.8 mile approach trail (which isn't included in the overall AT mileage), but for some reason I had never even considered that option. After registering as a thru-hiker at the Visitor Center, weighing my pack (29 pounds with 4 days of food and a liter of water), I was finally doing it. An encouraging and friendly worker offered to take a picture of my dad, sister and I under the arch, and off we were.The Stairs...oof. Almost immediately, the trek involved climbing 600+ stairs to the top of the falls and the 29 pound pack started to feel a whole lot heavier. I would be lying if I said the thought of ""WTF am I doing.."" didn't cross my mind. At the top of the falls, the author of The A.T. Guide, who many people worship due to the all-encompassing usefulness of his book, was running a booth since it was ""AT Kick-Off Weekend"". After a very underwhelming conversation and awkward book signing, I would have been more than happy to continue climbing stairs for the rest of the day.After another mile down the trail, my dad decided to say his goodbyes and did a very poor job trying to hide his jealousy. The rest of the day was relatively uneventful, making small talk with a bunch of giddy thru-hikers and passing by the doubtful stares of locals who see hundreds of people quit after just a few days -- every year. Reaching the summit of Springer Mountain truly meant the start of my journey. Mile 0.0 out of 2189.1. Even though I had already done 8.8. Dumb.Got to Stover Creek Shelter and made some dehydrated pasta for dinner. Immediately after, a couple, who completed the AT going southbound (SOBO) brought 50 Taco Bell tacos to the shelter along with a full box of Girl Scout Thin Mints. This is called Trail Magic. Only having been in the ""wilderness"" for less than 12 hours at this point, I ate a few, but didn't exhibit ""Hiker Hunger"" that I will most certainly have later in this trek. Trail Magic is more than welcomed by thru-hikers whose daily diets consist of oatmeal, Clif Bars, dried mashed potatoes, beef jerky and Ramen Noodles for 5-6 months of their lives. There will come a time where I would gluttonously eat multiple Grande Meals of cold, wet Taco Bell tacos... Ended the night with a fire and some good company sampling a fellow hiker's homemade Sweet Tea Moonshine.P.S. - Slept in shelter with my little sis and 1 other person (everyone else tented). Might be my last shelter experience unless the weather is terrible. Mice were running rampant throughout the night.P.S.S. - Wow. I'm actually doing it...","Amicalola Falls Visitor Center

Croc 'n' Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523449,"Pretty sure my sister, Tara, would have slept until noon if there weren't multiple people cooking breakfast and packing up their tents in the a.m. When we were growing up, she had typically gone for a run, made some ridiculously good artistic craft or trinket and eaten 2 meals before I stumbled down the stairs for some food in the ""morning"". Yes, 11:45 a.m. may be a technicality, but morning nonetheless... But last night, she had apparently buried herself in her sleeping bag and avoided the sun's blinding rays. She had also apparently avoided hearing the mice running circles around and over us all night. Anywho, today was another great day. We were feeling good and crushed a 13 mile trek to Gooch with plenty of daylight to spare. A foursome of Florida State bro's on spring break stumbled into camp with 50 pound packs filled with completely unnecessary items, but somehow had neglected to bring a single tent. A fellow thru-hiker wasn't too pleased that there would be 4 more bodies squished into the shelter, but thankfully, we had decided to tent long before this ordeal. This same thru-hiker also ""instructed"" the students to pull their weight around camp and made them go get firewood for the rest of our enjoyment.Camped next to some great people and stayed up sharing stories and laughs with a completely new group of people than the night before. Sipped some more whiskey around the fire and called it a night. Another great day in the books.","Stover Creek Shelter

Croc 'n' Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523453,"Could have done more miles today, but there was no rush. My sister has to get to her car at Neel Gap by tomorrow mid-day, and this was a good stopping point for the day. The requirements to have bear canisters (containers to keep food inside at night that are bear-smashing-biting-clawing-proof) within a 6 mile stretch after Lance Creek also limited us to a short day.Tonight there were some more familiar faces around the campfire, but also a few new ones. Again, sharing some fermented grain mash, new friends were made with the underlying understanding that you may never see one another again. People either go by first names or trail names, so looking people up after meeting them isn't a realistic option and the feeling of detachment is actually kind of refreshing. For this reason, you can be yourself and totally honest with these strangers/friends.Funny story time. Actually this could have ended very badly. As the fire dwindled, so did our numbers around the fire. People said their ""good nights"" and wandered off to their humble abodes at sporadic intervals. Eventually, one kid got up, said goodnight and blindly started stumbling to where he thought his tent was. Key word: thought. As he started walking, I noticed he hadn't thought to bring his headlamp out before it got dark around the fire. ""Hey man, need a light?"" I asked. Luckily I didn't even wait for him to answer but decided to turn my light on and shine it in his general direction. I really, really don't like to toot my own horn, but this kid was legitimately power-walking directly towards a rapidly approaching drop-off that led to an extremely steep embankment. Immediately, he changed direction by about 90 degrees and crawled safely into our tent. No words were exchanged until someone eventually said, ""Holy shit, I think Johnny would have died..."". Laughter erupted. Crisis averted.   Despite some difficult terrain, tomorrow should be a quick day to Neel Gap to drop off my sister at her rental car. I have to convince her to take me to grab some BBQ before going back at it...FYI - Filtering (or treating water in other ways) is a daily task when thru-hiking. Instead of attempting to carry enough water for multiple days, bringing a form of water treatment allows you to refill as needed. Since water weights 2.2 pounds per liter, you don't want to be carrying multiple days worth....I've easily been drinking 4-6 liters per day.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Croc 'n' Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523456,"Today was supposed to be a relatively short day. The climb up Blood Mountain was tiring, but the fog dissipated just as we reached the summit. Breathtaking. Logistically, everything worked perfectly. We arrived at Neel Gap right around noon to a pleasant surprise of Trail Magic. Burgers and Grape Soda. Delish. As my sister walked a half a mile to the parking area where her rental car was parked, I had the difficult job of talking to the people nice enough to make us food and watch her backpack - don't feel bad for her, I still have another 2150 miles to go... The burger wasn't enough, I was still craving a BBQ meal before heading off into the woods for another 4 days. So I grabbed my pack and started walking to the car with my sis. In the short distance to the car, I could feel the stares searing into the back of my head. ""Another one bites the dust"", many are thinking. One kid even stopped to tell me ""Don't quit man! Give it another shot! Just a few more days!"". These assumptions weren't without just cause. 25-30% of people attempting an AT thru-hike quit at this very spot every year. I really didn't give a damn what anyone thought, I just wanted a sloppy pulled pork sandwich and then I'd be right back at it. After verbalizing this to a few, I could tell they were not convinced. Whatever. One of the guys I had hiked with and camped a few times with by then ran over to the car and handed me a $10 bill for a pack of cigarettes. At least he knew I was coming back, and the plan was to meet at Bull Gap - just 1.1 miles past this outpost.Pulled pork sandwich was everything I had dreamed about and after washing my face and hair with hand soap in the the restaurant bathroom, I finally felt like a legitimate thru-hiker. Disgustingly dirty, smelly and determined. And it felt great.Grabbed two packs of smokes with the $10 and headed back to Neel Gap. Emptied the garbage from my pack, restocked with the food/fuel I had staged in my sister's car and I was ready to rock again. Pretty sure my sister shed a tear that she had to get off the trail, but unfortunately, not everyone can retire at such a young age. I count my lucky stars every night out here...Anyways. 1.1 miles until Bull Gap. A.k.a. home for the night. My sister and I had crushed 40.5 miles over the course of about 3.5 days. Not too shabby at all, so I wasn't worried about pushing it today. Plus my left ankle was starting to become more than a slight pain. I'd put it at about 4/10 on the scale (tickle - dead). I was excited to rip my boots off and slip into those sexy green and pink crocs. Okay...It's definitely been 1.1 miles. Where is this place???! Apparently I wasn't the only one that knew I should have been there by now. A girl up ahead called to me, ""Do you think this is Bull Gap?"" referring to a clearing with a fire pit and enough space for a few tents. After looking around briefly, I confidently said ""I don't think so, the guide says there's supposed to be a reliable water source. No water here..."" Water is the ultimate necessity and it's totally idiotic to risk running out. That made the decision to push on easy. I knew my friend that asked for the cigs was ahead of us and he planned on stopping at Bull Gap too; another reason to be reassured this wasn't the spot. Now that we knew we'd at least be setting up shop at the next good location, we exchanged names and continued hiking. I noticed that her gait was hindered by some underlying feet issues just like mine. Blisters are extremely common in the beginning of a thru-hike as your body struggles to adjust to the pack weight and high mileage. 2 miles later, we finally arrive on a ridge that has one tent pitched and a smiling familiar face. ""1.1 miles to Bull Gap?! More like Bulls*** Gap!"", he yells. At least we're all on the same page. At least I can unload these cigarettes.4 other people trickled into our campsite with other colorful words about the 1.1 mile. Misery loves company. That being said, after pulling off my left sock, I would not wish that on anyone. The duct tape/moleskin combo helped a little bit, but the situation was getting gross. The blister that was previously about the size of a silver dollar pancake had popped and was now a gaping wound that was multiple layers of skin thick. After doing some surgery and applying antibiotic cream, I hope it heals a bit overnight. Pictures to come...Very windy night - beautiful sunset.","Lance Creek
",Bull[s***] Gap,"Mar 09, Wed",10.30
Croc 'n' Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523459,"Yup. This is going to be a problem. After quickly packing up my tent, pulling down my bear bag of food and trash, and scarfing some food down in the foggy morning light, I had a decision to make. Take a zero day (a term for doing zero miles and resting due to a variety of reasons - this would definitely qualify), retape/moleskin and hope it doesn't get worse, or wear my camp shoes which happen to be ridiculously colored Crocs. Hmmmm. Even the thought of putting on my boots seemed terrible and I knew that I would just continue to make matters worse. And the thought of a zero day, just sitting in my tent feeling sorry for myself so early on wasn't an option either. Crocs it is.I didn't have great expectations for the day but actually cruised to our tenting spot for the night. My feet felt great, my legs felt great and the fact that I didn't have to even think about my blister was a fantastic feeling. It was even better knowing I gave it a full day to heal despite pounding out a 10 mile day. 2 birds, 1 stone.A group at Tesnatee Gap provided us with another bout of fantastic early morning Trail Magic and he claimed that the drop out rate to that point is 40% per year. A mere 7 miles past the outpost where there is a 25-30% rate, and somehow another 10% manage to quit. I guess people spend a night in the hostel, shower, eat real food and convince themselves that they can go out and get back at it. I guess that confidence boost doesn't work very long...Another awesome view and another awesome campfire. Familiar faces are becoming more and more frequent as the days go on and the trail is noticeably less crowded. Hanging a bear bag at Poplar Stamp was nearly impossible. Thousands of trees in every direction, yet none seemed to have any horizontal branches within throwing height. Little bit of a hike...","Bull[shit] Gap
",Poplar Stamp Gap,"Mar 10, Thu",10
Croc 'n' Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523461,"Another full day in the Crocs. I don't want to, but it's a necessity. If I try to force myself to use my boots again too soon, I'm sure it'll put me out of commission for a day or two. Today, the terrain and small issues people have been having are starting to add up. I feel grateful to still be going strong and that I was able to find a solution to my biggest problem *knock on wood*. Once at Unicoi Gap, there was some Trail Magic in the form of hot dogs, burgers and soda. The temptation to head to town for the night was there since so many people were heading in to take a ""nero"" (nearly zero day) or an actual zero, but I had no real reason to so I pushed on. As for the campsite, I guess it was an award winning 19th Century Cheese Factory. I was expecting cool ruins and toppled foundations once I got there, but there wasn't even a brick in sight. Another great fire tonight and some conversations with people that are definitely now my friends. We even have a black lab named Jetta to play with. Her owner isn't too fond of Mad Max and one point of conversation revolved around that movie for quite some time. ""I live. I die. I LIVE AGAIN!""","Poplar Stamp Gap

Croc 'n' Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523465,"Yup. Another Croc day. It really isn't that bad, my feet just get a little sore by the end of the day due to the lack of support. I also have to be deliberate with my steps and take extra caution with my foot placement. People are shocked that I'm doing so many miles in Crocs. At this point, about half my mileage has been in them. They should probably send me free pairs since I'm repping them so well... Hmmmm...Early this morning I rapidly closed distance between myself and another hiker. This wasn't hard to do since they were doubled over with their pack on while dry-heaving. I asked if everything was alright and she said ""Not at all"". I finally convinced her to sit down and take her pack off and explain the situation. She had started the journey on March 1st and has struggled with various issues up until this point. Now, the big issue was the fact that her original hiking buddies ""bailed on her"". She met them on Facebook and decided they would hike the AT as a group. Not a good idea for a group of random people to commit to that. Differences in personality, hiking speed, and a million other factors come into play for a strenuous 6 month journey that can tear a group apart. Anyways, the fact that they ""bailed"" really made her ""mad"". She was so mad that she stopped eating the proper amount of food and drinking the right amount of water. Makes sense right? It also happened that these people decided to split gear so they all wouldn't have to carry 1 of everything if they could just share. This actually makes sense...until the person with the stove quits and the other two can't cook....Long story short, I forced her to drink water, take a break and even gave her half of my beef jerky which I was soooooooo looking forward to later and a few packages of peanut butter and cheese crackers. She didn't have any food that had a high sodium content which is necessary to retain the water you're drinking when burning a lot of calories. I really hope she was just slightly malnourished and dehydrated and wasn't actually contracting Norovirus which is debilitating and highly contagious on the trail. An ex-paramedic/firefighter was going to keep an eye on her for the remainder of the day. The sense of community and camaraderie among strangers is truly amazing out here. But about that rain. I haven't talked about the weather much since I started and that is because it's been non-stop beautiful. Totally spoiled. But tonight, it's supposed to rain cats and dogs with Zeus tossing lightning bolts. Kelly Knob nearly killed me today. Toughest climb of the trip so far. 822 feet vertical in less than a mile -- pretty steep, but awesome reward at the top.P.s. - I think powdered mashed potatoes are better than the real thing.

Many people decided to stay in Hiawassee for another night due to ominous forecasts calling for severe thunderstorms. Impatient and excited to continue, I called my main girl Sue for a ride back to Dicks Creek Gap. Almost immediately upon exiting her car, I knew I was going to have to dial back my lofty goals. 13 people plus the adorable black lab in a triple-decker shelter was the safe bet since pushing on would have required trekking along an exposed ridge.

Yet again, the beginning of the day began by slipping on my crocs as I was shaking my head, but quickly turned into cranking out a 16.2 mile day in very high spirits. The St. Patty's excitement was running rampant on the trail and though I had no prior intentions of heading into town, it started to sound pretty damn good. Nothing like green beer and curdled car bombs for some good ole fashioned calorie intake and sloppy fun... Also, I can't keep continuing on with my current foot situation and decided I really need to take a full day off to give the gaping wounds a real chance to heal. Heal heel!

",Long Branch Shelter,"Mar 16, Wed",16.20
Croc 'n' Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526164,"Long Branch Shelter further promoted the idea of a town day. Posted inside were shuttle schedules that pick up hikers from two separate locations with drop-off in Franklin, NC; Rock Gap and Winding Stair Gap. While it is nice to maximize town days, pushing a few extra miles before heading into town is more rewarding to me. It makes the bad habits and bingeing associated with town seemingly more deserved. Most people did a quick 3.5 to catch the 9:30 shuttle out of Rock Gap, but a few of us, the ones I happen to be closest with, all decided to push it 7.3 over some moderate terrain to catch a noon shuttle from Winding Stair Gap. Even 7.3 felt a little lazy to me, but plenty of people are still governing their pace (either voluntary or involuntary) to 7-10 miles a day in order to strengthen the body and hopefully prevent over-use injuries.Putting the blinders on and keeping the greetings brief, we blazed past the lazy bum's at Rock Gap and hustled to Winding Stair. The green beer and car bombs will be well deserved tonight...or will they???I would be hesitant to ask my friends from home, college and work to describe my personality (for the most part I don't think the adjectives would be too terrible...), but most people know my love of (typically idiotic) fun and drinking with a heavy dose of reminiscing. For their own reasons, my new trail companions do not share the passion for drinking. While a little surprised, it certainly didn't make me like them any less. If anything, I weirdly admired their indifference and in one case, the conscious and deliberate avoidance of alcohol during this trek.Interestingly enough, our hotel happened to be outside of the Franklin downtown so this quickly spelled a few beers and floating solo in the pool on St. Patty's Day. It took a lot for me to turn down the bombardment of texts from the rowdy crew that was going buck wild downtown. The 2 mile walk (partially on a highway) was just not enticing enough. Also, catching up on college basketball while afloat was pretty nice anyway.My friend Sara came and joined in the floating while Jetta (the adorable black lab) lay staring jealously as she was tied to the life-ring.

Croc 'n' Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526169,"I was up and ready to go at 7. Unfortunately, this was the first day I had nothing to do and nowhere to be. Sara and Aaron (Saraaron?) decided they didn't need a day of rest and planned on heading out mid-morning. One of Sara's old coworkers met us at the hotel and hand-delivered some much appreciated Dunkin' Donut fare. We had all eaten a full breakfast already, but there is always room to scarf down a few donuts. The blister brigade,(nobody has or ever will refer to us as that), Rachel and I took advantage of our day off and the cheap public transportation in the form of a short-bus who's typical clientele probably hovers around the 70 year old benchmark. Stopped in at an awesome gear store called Outdoor 76 where both of us meandered around debating buying the super-light, super-popular and super-expensive down jackets that 95% of other thru-hikers own. Despite my heaviest layer being a casual fleece and hers being a thin hoodie, the price tags were laughable and we both decided against it. Worst case, I'll crawl into my sleeping bag with every layer of clothing I have. Hopefully that's enough?We then stopped by the bookstore where I picked up a copy of Brave New World and Journey to the Centre of the Earth. It's funny how at least one of these classic works was assigned during my high school career and I had less than no interest in actually reading it. Sparknotes was just too easy. Pretty embarrassing to admit that but at least I'm completing the assignment eventually...better late than never right?Got caught next to a very knowledgeable local that prided himself on his awareness of Franklin, NC history on the public transportation on the way back to the hotel. Rachel expertly avoided the conversation by cracking open her book and creating a forcefield that left me unprotected an vulnerable. I heard all about Shawn Bryson, the football pride of the town that had a very mediocre career in the NFL who eventually came back to his birthplace to open a store called ""Goin' Postal"" - a competitor to UPS and FedEx when mailing packages. Not sure what I would have done without that gem of information...Back at the hotel, it was time to replenish, repack and refocus on hiking. Knowing that Rachel had extra ziplocks, I offered a trade of a half gallon of chocolate milk for a few bags. With the immediate response of ""Haha I will definitely take some chocolate milk"", the deal was done.   We also, (barely) remembered to print our Smoky's thru-hiking permit and we were ready to go again. Just needed to figure out a ride back to the trail. After calling a bunch of volunteers from a local hiking group, an older woman agreed to pick us up at 8:30 sharp the next morning.","Comfort Inn

Croc 'n' Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526170,"After a few phone calls and a little sweet talking, our shuttle driver arrived at the Comfort inn with two ziplock baggies of home-made cookies. This older woman was part of a local hiking group and assists the ATC with trail maintenance. Despite being a free ride, I gave her $10 for the club since she went very far out of her weekend morning to come pick us up and drop us off. With homemade cookies. It was well worth it. After just a few quick miles, I spied a sign ""Join us for breakfast"" with a very enticing arrow pointing down to a camping area. Immediately, I was asked if I would like a bacon, egg and cheese and either a soda or beer. Trying to start this next section responsibly, I opted for the BEC and soda. After digging through the cooler pretty thoroughly, the girl said, ""looks like we've only got PBR left.."". It's the thought that counts right (as I crack open the 10 a.m. beer)? 
Some good conversation with a fellow ex-Rhode Islander led to her current profession in the Wilderness Therapy field. Very interesting career taking groups of, in this case, children into the woods for a full week and teaching them survival skills as well as the importance of nature and fresh air in our lives. Technology advances are great in a large variety of ways, but it has also disconnected many people from actual human interaction and the urge to play outdoors. Definitely plenty of value in this career.
Also found out that steeping a raspberry tea bag in a mug of hot chocolate is a killer combo. Going to have to remember that one...","Winding Stair Gap

Croc 'n' Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526171,"Yep, broken record time. Another day in the Crocs... The open, pusing wound that was once a blister is continuing to be an issue. Other than that, woke up feeling good and ready to hike. The weather was looking pretty ominous so a push to the Nantahala Outdoor Center was definitely in the back of a lot of our minds. Bunks at this place were $20 which included a hot shower, so the temptation grew as the day became colder and the forecast evolved to include snow and sub-freezing temperatures overnight. The hike down into the NOC is hard to explain, but it was certainly one of the toughest declines on the trek thus far. From a daily high of 5030ft above sea level to 1732ft over rocky and muddy terrain, my feet were screaming at me. Not to mention I had to take extreme caution with every footstep so I wouldn't twist an ankle or slide off a cliff with the casual footwear selection. 
Called in a reservation from the top of a fire tower - good to know that credit card fraud doesn't question the wrong name on a card... I had given my name for the reservation but used Rachel's card since I had cash to pay her and the guy ran the card under my name. See what happens I guess. Had to rush to get the keys by 5.
Arrived at the NOC and the dogs were barking. At the registration I saw my buddy Ben from RI who is joining the trek for a limited amount of time before starting PA school. I was greeted with a beer and the invitation to dinner with a group of familiar/unfamiliar faces. At the waitress' suggestion of dessert, I wasn't initially interested but Rachel looked over and said ""split the peach cobbler?"" and that was all it took. Absolutely delicious. Aaron (Tea-time) and Sara joined as well and made for great company. The hot shower felt phenomenal until the trek to the bunkhouse in the lightly falling snow had to be completed...
Definitely making it a point to come back to the NOC for some rafting/kayaking.

Croc 'n' Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526172,"So all of that elevation we lost yesterday? Yup, had to make it all up today. Instead of ""The Jumpoff"", we had ""The Jumpup"". Got off to a slow start partially because I was dreading hiking in my boots, but the snow and mud made it a necessity, and partially because Rachel had left her stove behind at the previous shelter by accident. The sense of community out here continues to surprise me. Despite everyone complaining about how much their pack weighs, most people are extremely willing to pack a forgotten/dropped piece of gear and deliver it on down the trail. Through the grapevine of hikers, Rachel had gotten a text that ""4-Year"", who had gotten his name simply from the conversation of someone asking how long he had been growing his beard, would be arriving at the NOC this morning with her stove. 
Once getting the stove, we were off. While I'd like to attach a picture of the excessively muddy and snowy trail, I had to post this one instead. By far my favorite view of the trip so far. Cheoah Bald with views of the Great Smoky Mountains, the monsters that I will be tackling in just a few days.
Campsite was very crowded tonight, the constant elevation gain of the course of the day prevented most people from attempting another 6 miles to the next shelter. Sara's dog Jetta got into a fight with a section hiker's dog that escalated much further than I thought it would. Resulted in the other owner getting bit by his own dog.

Croc 'n' Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526174,"Fontanaaaaaa. Iconic section of the trail since you hike across the tallest trail in the Eastern U.S. and at the time of its creation in the 1940's, it was the 4th tallest dam in the world. But first, I had to get a ride into ""town"" to pick up a resupply package for the Smoky's. A shuttle was obtained by using the ""House Phone"" at the marina since there is absolutely zero cell service and a beat-up van quickly came to pick us up. We arrived at the General Store/Post Office and mMmMmmmmm chocolate milk. My wonderful parents threw this package together with some food I had stashed at the house as well as a quick run to the grocery store for a few odds and ends. Thanks Mom and Dad! Although I will say that I was disappointed you didn't sneak a flask of whiskey in there...
As I was exchanging my new food for old garbage on the stoop to the General Store, an older woman pulled in and started asking us about our trip so far. One thing led to another and we found out that she had thru-hiked a few years ago and is attempting the PCT this year. Pretty impressive for a woman in her late 60's to mid-70's (???) who probably weighed all of 95 pounds. After asking if I wanted a ride back to the marina, which I gratefully accepted, and a sip of whiskey, which I confusedly declined, she continued talking to other hikers and offered the same. Quickly we had a full car and we were off to the marina. Turns out that ""A sip of whiskey"" really meant a brand new flask of Hennessy and a hiker named Big Fudge was the lucky recipient. 
My group has now separated for one reason or another (dogs aren't allowed in the Smoky's, family visiting, zero day, etc.) but I know I'll see a lot of these folks again soon. Continuing across the dam, I took my time to soak in the awe of this impressive man-made structure and continued for the southern entrance to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Everyone had been talking nervously about this section of our trek, but I was pumped. A friendly couple originally from Massachusetts was asking about the journey and was extremely encouraging (which I've found strangely comforting from complete strangers) and took my picture right outside the park boundary. 
I arrived at the only tenting site in the Smoky's around 5 where I found Ben. The Smoky's require thru-hikers to stay at shelters at all times although they must give up their spots in a full shelter to section hikers with nightly reservations. Dinner, reading and early bedtime after this fun-filled day.

Croc 'n' Roll,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526176,"Uhhhhh, where is everyone? Completely overslept and didn't leave camp until 11 a.m. Wasn't completely my fault, Birch Spring was a gap where the surrounding mountains make for quite a late sunrise. Additionally, the clouds were moving in and the last I heard was a forecast filled with heavy rain and potentially thunder and lightning. Have to play today by ear with a forecast like that. Committing to a plan can be dangerous and you have to be willing to accept a lower mile day if the trail becomes exposed ridge line. Got to Russell Field Shelter (8.3 mile day) and despite the high winds and extremely dark skies, the rain hadn't amounted to more than brief showers. Instead of shacking up, I decided to do another quick 3 miles to Spence Field. No more than 3 minutes into starting back up, the skies opened. Rain, hail and darkness. Great decision.
Even though I was only out in this weather for about an hour. I haven't been happier to see the sign indicating the shelter was nearby. While hiking, I was nice and warm, but as soon as I stopped the cold and shivering hit me instantly. Cooked a quick dinner of mashed potatoes and sausage, changed clothes and set up my pad/bag inside the shelter. Ben was there and warned me I would probably get ""talked to"" by the Ridgerunner. Ridgerunners are ATC employees that help maintain trails and educate hikers on Leave-No-Trace principles. Take only pictures, leave only footprints. 
I was lectured on the importance of using established tent pads and camping close to streams (even though the area I used was clearly commonly camped at, I was 75 feet from the stream, and I was also downstream of where people fill up their water). Anyways, I convinced him that I was a responsible hiker and avoid impacting the environment in any negative manner and eventually the lecture was over.

It got to the point that when people started talking about noro, I walked away. I couldn't take the paranoia and hearsay anymore.

Wasn't a super tough climb today since we have been steadily gaining elevation since entering the Smoky's. Wasn't what I expected at the top and slightly disappointed to be honest. Very touristy, with a concrete spire that is easily accessible from a nearby parking lot. Today was the first day the road was opened so it was mobbed with people by the time I got there at 10 a.m. Pretty fogged in so I didn't get a very good view and decided to snack at the top. People had widespread emotions and thoughts regarding the idea of hiking from Georgia to Maine. Some people thought it was insane, some people thought it was totally awesome and other people just didn't even understand it.
""Wait. So you walk the whole time? How do you get more food? You drink water from streams?!? How long does it take?""
That last question is the best, for multiple reasons. Some people clearly skipped or failed U.S. geography because people don't seem to understand where Maine is. Some people thought it would take 2 weeks. 2 weeks. To walk from Georgia to Maine. Wow. Some people thought it would take 3 years. Wow again. 
Anyways, some people thought it was very inspiring and asked for their kids to take a picture with a ""real thru-hiker"" - someone who is legitimately walking 2,200 miles to Maine. A man Rick, from Indiana, was pretty jealous and enamored by the idea and slipped me a $10 bill for a ""well-deserved burger"" one of these days. Despite my resistance and convincing that I had saved enough to complete this trek, he insisted I keep it. I plan on keeping it in my wallet in case there is a situation where someone desperately needs it.
The rest of the day ended up being pretty tough and I really had to stand my ground at Newfound Gap to resist a ride into Gatlinburg. I had purposely packed enough food to avoid needing a resupply in this town. After laying on the ground to rest my foot pain, someone walked over and asked if I would like a banana. Yup. It was great. Met a man that attempted a thru-hike last year and offered encouragement to endure despite guaranteed upcoming hardships. 
Got to the shelter and boy, was there ever trail magic. Mt. Dew, Coke, Pepsi, fruit, bags of chips, cookies. So awesome. Also a bunch of dad's with their son's that were extremely social and doing their best (but not a very good) job at hiding their jealousy. Great conversations with families and friends from Cincinnati and Michigan. Some of them even made extra chicken and stuffing so I didn't even need to cook. Great, great night.

Just prior to leaving the Park, I was highly interrogated by a Ridgerunner. After she realized everything was in order, which really only meant that I had my permit, she continued hiking seemingly disappointed to not find a legitimate reason to lecture me. I also complimented her earrings, which were in the shape of an 'AT' and was blatantly ignored. Oh well. Maury wasn't my type anyway...
Relatively low on food and feeling accomplished, a short day and a night at Standing Bear Hostel seemed well deserved. I was greeted by a large man named ""Lumpy"" and I couldn't quite tell if he was a redneck or hippie. Either way, a seasoned thru-hiker, with plenty of funny one-liners and quirky advice for us ""Tenderfeet"". 
After settling in and eating an expired, yet delicious frozen pizza as well as a rib sandwich, a few of us were hanging by the unlit firepit. Not quite sure how the conversation evolved, but someone mentioned the quote by Albert Einstein, ""I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."" Lumpy overheard this as he was resupplying a customer with beers and said ""Hell yeah! That's more my speed!

Max Patch was one of the coolest spots I have ever seen in my life. First twenty mile day. And some great trail magic. Beers and fruit on the top of Max Patch gave me the buzzed energy to push another 7 miles which would make the trek to Hot Springs much more doable tomorrow. Also - pancakes and soda right before the last big climb for the day. I honestly don't know if I would have made it to the top without that sticky, sugary, maple goodness. 
Camping at the top of Walnut Mountain was probably the worst decision I have made this trip thus far. Sustained winds of 30-40mph with gusts of 60+. Oof. I just didn't have the energy to push on any further, and neither did the other poor saps I ended up camping with. After hearing a woman curse at the wind for about 10 minutes, I begrudgingly got out of my cozy sleeping bag and helped her set up her tent. After getting back in mine, I knew I wasn't going to sleep at all. I basically laid there waiting for the first sign of light and got out of my partially collapsed tent to see the ruins of the campsite. Multiple tents were completely collapsed and broken tree limbs were strewn across the ground. I escaped unscathed but my tent has two small holes in the bug netting.

There was plenty of rapid eye movement last night, but not in the form of sleep. Honestly, the longest stretch of sleep I had last night was probably a whole 20 minutes. The night was spent hoping a tree or tree limb didn't fall on top of me which made for a pretty un-restful rest. Multiple times throughout the night I debated breaking down camp, throwing everything into my pack and just starting to hike again. I ultimately ended up waiting until the first sign of daylight to hopefully avoid leaving stuff behind in the chaos and sustained winds. With all of that free time, I was able to finish Brave New World, and pawn off those extra ounces to a girl named Oats.
Despite feeling like a zombie and coming close to sleep-hiking, I made decent time into town and saw a crowd of newly familiar faces at the diner. Without hesitation, I joined them (TopKnot, Flicker, Simpleman, Booksmarts, UV, Rachel, Rusty Bridges) and ordered a 32 oz chocolate milk and fried chicken sandwich with tater tots. Wow. So good. No AT&T service (already starting to see a trend with this) so I walked with Rachel when she went to pick up a package at the Mountain Magnolia Inn. I don't typically feel out of place, mostly because I don't typically care what people think, but walking into this extremely upscale hotel just didn't seem right. I'm sure plenty of hikers stay here, but I wasn't going to be one of them. Nearly everything was booked and our options were extremely limited to we ended up splitting a room that had two separate beds.
I'm starting to really come around on the whole shower thing. Not that I took them for granted, I just never used to look forward to showering. Maybe it was because I had been conditioned that showering meant getting ready for something else, i.e. school, work, etc. Things that I may not have been thrilled to go do. But now I can legitimately watch my filth wash down the drain, explore a new town, and go binge on more food and drinks.

Up until this point, hanging bear bags had kind of been a joke and just became a good habit of mine that I decided to keep up with. Plenty of people had already given up this task since it could be a little bit of a hassle finding an appropriate tree and getting a rope hung. At the Watauga Lake Shelter there was a bear pole so everyone complied with hanging their food and garbage at the top of this; especially since it was well-known that this shelter had been closed for the previous 3 years due to bear issues. 
At this point, it is worth noting that the hike around the lake was absolute disgusting and a disgrace to the the Appalachian Trail. Most of the trail is lakeside, under an embankment from a major road where people seemingly throw anything and everything from their car onto the road and into the woods. On top of that, the designated campsites were no more than landfills at this point either. Typically, I pick up garbage that I see on the trail, but this was a lost cause. With hundreds of food wrappers and beverage containers at each campsite, it would take a weekend with dozens of volunteers to begin turning it around.
A little discouraged with the surrounding area, I was actually impressed by the cleanliness of the shelter and the presence of a bear pole. Didn't help. Dusk rolled in and by then we had a crowd of about 10 people. The shelter was full and 4 of us had tents pitched. Hanging out by the fire, people are doing a variety of night time chores, and some of the late-comers are finishing up their dinner. A father and son that are hiking together call their wife/mom and take turns talking to her. After the son was finished recapping the day, he passed the phone over to his dad and went to hang his food bag and spend a few more minutes socializing by the fire. Just a few moments later, we hear the dad in the yelling in the distance so a few of us that were still awake (yes, many people are actually asleep by 8pm every night) ran down to where he was to see what was going on. We saw a shredded tent and quickly put 2 and 2 together. A bear. What we thought was unintelligible yelling was actually ""Holy s***! There's a bear in Alex's tent!"", which is exactly what every mother wants to hear before her husband hangs up the phone. Luckily, Alex wasn't in the tent, but it wasn't an ideal situation losing $500 of various important gear in the middle of the woods. After helping him pack up and carry his stuff to the shelter, I decided to double and triple check my tent for any hidden food wrappers or any scented items. Sometimes I forget to put the toothpaste and toothbrush in my bear bag, but thankfully tonight I had remembered. As I am doing this, I hear the father yell in desperation once more, this time with anger instead of fear. The bear had snuck around the shelter after ravaging through the first tent, and started exploring the next furthest tent from the fire/shelter area. Another ripped tent, sleeping bag and sleeping pad, with copious amounts of bear slobber on everything else. Long story short, I'm pretty confident this father/son combo lost about $1100 worth of gear in a few short minutes. It is also important to note that neither of them had food or garbage inside their tent. It's a scary thought that these bears might just associate all tents with food now.
Anyways, at this point, I was more concerned about losing my gear next, since I was now the most removed person from the shelter, so I broke down my tent and planned on cowboy camping right next to the fire. As I'm laying my stuff out around the fire, I remembered about my pal Teatime. He had gone into his tent about an hour before all the commotion saying he was going to listen to an audiobook and go to bed after a tiring day. I went over to his tent, shook it and said ""Yo Teatime, you awake?"" After getting a little bit of a groggy response, I explained what had happened and the previously unaware camper had his tent packed away in a matter of minutes and joined the rest of us around the fire. With limited amount of room directly around the fire, of course I ended up being the furthest one away. AKA bear bait. We decided to take turns keeping the fire stoked and keeping an eye out just in case the bear got adventurous again. By 1 a.m. my adrenaline had started to fade and my eyes finally began to droop. Not long after, a loud rattling noise, a scream and a lot of rustling in the trees occurs. I hear ""Bear on the pole!"" as I'm sitting up to see what is going on. I saw a bear on its hind legs, with its front legs stretched out long and high shaking the bear pole with all of its might. It only took a few pushes for one bag to fly off the pole and the bear to run off with it. This chaos was followed by noises that were (in any other situation) laughably similar to Chewbacca's in Star Wars and clear fighting amongst multiple bears for the food.
Needless to say, I think I slept for a grand total of 15 minutes and was out of camp at the crack of dawn.
Rough night.
P.s - Bears are smart.","Grassy Meadow (after Moreland Gap Shelter)

While I was there, I couldn't pass up a half gallon of chocolate milk and some oreos for breakfast. Enjoyed these thoroughly at the library while painfully updating my journal. As I was doing so, my friend Hooks (from RI) strolled into the library coincidentally. I hadn't seen him in quite some time, but it was perfect timing. Friends of friends left us a hint of where to find trail magic they left for us in town. 
The kindness found on this journey never ceases to amaze me. My fantastic pals Alex and Molly from RI informed their friends Michele and JD that Hooks and I are hiking the AT. Despite never meeting in person, they decided to surprise us with some trail magic and genuine southern hospitality with gifts at both a restaurant and a local brewery. The only thing that could have made this better would be actually meeting them and sharing their company. Someday for sure!","Damascus, VA
