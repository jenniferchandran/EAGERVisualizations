greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518902,"To Friends & Family:   I still pinch myself to realize that it's not a dream any longer. I still have a lot of prep to do and gear to buy before March, and it's easy to become overwhelmed with all of the various thoughts about the hike. I'm truly thankful for this incredible opportunity and for all of the support you provide!","

Started hiking at noon and it was a rough 9 miles to get to Springer at 1700. Collapsed from exhaustion at the campsite. My tenting neighbors just stared blankly at me. Clearly, there will be a conditioning introductory period. But, it's official! The thru-hike is underway.","Towson, MD

greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525718,"Felt like I had new legs as I hiked down the mountain. But that was just it - I was going downhill... Soon enough, the trail went back up and I was back to slow labored strides. After being used to day-hiking without a pack and going blazing fast, having a ~35lb. pack has humbled me and cut my speed in half. I think that I'll get the speed back in a week or so when my legs get stronger. All in all, I love being out here.","Springer Mountain

greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525720,"So I know I said that I would take my first couple weeks easy, and limit my mileage to about an average of 10 miles a day, but it's just my nature to push myself. Georgia hiking is pretty tough. No level hiking, all up and down. Still getting used to the disparity from a quiet, peaceful experience of hiking the trail throughout the day, and coming into a crowded, noisy campsite in the evening. All part of the package.","Justus Creek
",Jarrard Gap,"Mar 25, Fri",12.30
greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525721,"By the way, I forgot to mention I had my first bit of trail magic yesterday at Woody Gap. Trail magic is free food and stuff for thru-hikers by former hikers or supportive townspeople. Anyway, I'm getting faster at breaking down my tent, having breakfast, and getting going. The first two miles was a climb to Blood Mountain, which had the best views so far. It was also a popular spot for day hikers. Unfortunately, it was overcast today and the visibility was poor. As the day wore on, my feet became more painful, especially my left arch where a subdermal blister has been forming. I hope that my low arches don't eventually handicap me from completing the hike.","Jarrard Gap

greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525723,"Happy Easter! Thank you God for everything!Thick fog most of the day, and it was cold, wet, and pretty much miserable hiking weather. Thankfully, more trail magic was waiting for me at Unicoi Gap. Hot dogs never tasted so good. These trail angels were all former thru-hikers. Trail magic certainly reminds you that what you are attempting is pretty special. I decided then and there, that I needed a little break, so I hitched a ride (my first hitch ever) to the town of Helen, a tacky alpine-themed tourist trap, but it was offseason. I got a room for the night and I guess I'll put in extra miles tomorrow.","Sheep Rock Top

greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525728,"Generally, North Carolina hiking is a lot more tame so far than Georgia. Very welcome. Pumped out a lot of miles today and felt pretty good. Blisters are multiplying on my feet, and my left arch is still worrisome, but my legs are getting stronger. Looking forward to seeing Spring out here soon.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527569,"At Winding Stair Gap I was greeted by a big man in a white t-shirt named Ron Haven. As soon as he saw me, he went into a speech in his thick, southern accent about his town, Franklin, NC. I hopped in his van and when we picked up some more hikers, he started his speech over again. He was particularly proud of his 20 year history of taking care of thru-hikers and all of his fine restaurants in town. When asked which restaurant is his favorite, he replied, ""do you see how fat I am?"" We laughed. The man is undoubtedly an icon to the AT.","Betty Creek Gap

Bad that since I'm going back onto the trail from a town, it's a lot of uphill and my energy stores were depleted before long.","Winding Stair Gap; Franklin, NC

",Grassy Gap,"Apr 02, Sat",15
greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528078,"Every so often, the A.T. has a laugh at you. There's a 2 mile stretch called Jacob's Ladder where the trail is routed completely unfairly straight up a mountain. No switchbacks or reasonable gradual grading. In fact, it should be pointed out that I estimate that the A.T. is routed to go over the summit of a hill or mountain 4 out of 5 times. 3 out of those 4 there is no apparent point to it - no view or other reward. The other 1 out of 5 times the trail is routed around the side of a mountain. So when I see a mountain approaching, I hope for the 1 out of 5. Of course, this is from the context of having to grind out hard miles every day. When I'm done with the hike, I suppose I'll appreciate the fact that the A.T. did it's best to show me the best of the Appalachians.","Grassy Gap
",Brown Fork Gap,"Apr 03, Sun",13.70
greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528080,"Into the Smokies. More griping, sorry... The A.T. also has a tendency of making you climb up a mountain on the cold, windward side and then descending on the warmer, leeward side whereas mercy would be the other way around. The entrance to the south end of the Smokies was prefaced by the picturesque Fontana Dam which could be seen from several miles out.","Brown Fork Gap

greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528082,"Unbelievably cold this morning. Very hard to get moving. Stayed cold all day. About half way in, my left quadriceps became very tight and painful. I had to go very slow going downhill because any weight on it would set it off. It think the strain is due to pushing hard every day and my quads not being strong enough to handle the repeated severe downhill hiking.","Birch Spring Gap

",Standing Bear Hostel,"Apr 09, Sat",18.50
greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529204,"Checked out with Lumpy (the ZZ Top mountain man caretaker of the hostel) early and set out. Any time you are coming out of an inhabited area of the trail, you find yourself doing a lot of climbing to get back into the mountains. 5 miles of huffing and puffing got me to Snowbird Mountain, where some eager trail angels welcomed me with more good ol' trail magic. These good people along with some day hikers I met later on, made me feel like a celebrity for attempting to thru hike. Today's journal entry is dedicated to my new supporters. Thanks.","Standing Bear Hostel
",Lemon Gap,"Apr 10, Sun",18.60
greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529206,"In the morning, I looked at my guide book to get an idea of the difficulty of the hiking ahead. At first glance, I saw two moderately strenuous climbs early on, and then pretty much downhill until Hot Springs. The hike itself was not as easy as expected. The A.T. always throws another mountain in your path to climb, just to make sure you aren't getting too comfortable. Hot Springs was a lot smaller and low-key than I expected. Not much going on, but still a welcome place to rest. Stayed at a charming hotel called Mountain Magnolia Inn.","Lemon Gap

",Flint Mountain Shelter,"Apr 13, Wed",16.10
greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529211,"At Flint Shelter, a couple of southbound section hikers were talking about a guy doing trail magic at Sam's Gap, 11 miles into today's hike. Apparently, the guy cooks eggs and all other kinds of hot goodies. So of course, my whole morning was filled with the yearning expectation of these delightful eggs. But Murphy's Law sucker punched me. The guy wasn't there. Nothing crueler than messing with a hiker's food.","Flint Mountain Shelter
",Bald Mountain Shelter,"Apr 14, Thu",19.10
greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529214,"Arrived into Erwin and to my dismay, when I looked 200 yards down the road, I saw the hostel overflowing with hikers. I just can't win. I realized why my plan of hiking a lot more miles every day in order to get out ahead of the masses of other hikers is just not enough. A lot of hikers cheat. Or at least what I consider cheating. Commonly, hikers will get shuttled from one spot to another and skip a bunch of miles. Other times, hikers ""slackpack."" One variation is to be shuttled ahead to a spot where the hiking is easier coming back south, then the hiker walks back to the point of origin not carrying his pack. Finally, the hiker gets a ride with his gear back to the slack spot. As much as this kind of thing makes me shake my head, the definition of thru-hiker or ""2000 miler"" allows for a lot of liberties.","Bald Mountain Shelter
","Uncle Johnny's Hostel; Erwin, TN","Apr 15, Fri",16.60
greentree,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529215,"I think perhaps the A.T. trail routers had sensed my gripes and groans about the day-to-day layout of the trail. I'd say that perhaps the last 50 miles or so of the trail has been much more reasonable - fair grading and utilizing more sides of mountains rather than unnecessarily climbing the summit of each and every one. So to the spirits of the A.T. creators, I say thanks.","Uncle Johnny's Hostel; Erwin, TN
