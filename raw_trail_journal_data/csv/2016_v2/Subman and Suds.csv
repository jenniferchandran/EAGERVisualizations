Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/483975,Suds and I hiked up the Approach trail to Springer today. Left at 1100 and got up to Springer around 1615. We met quite a few Thru-Hiker wanna-bes starting out. Our friend Trailchef was starting the next morning and we wanted to see him off. We met Super wolf and Conductor. It was a beautiful clear night with a lot of hikers tenting. The next day walking back to Amicalola we met many hikers struggling up to Springer some only made Black Gap Shelter.

First week of June my parents visited. After suffering a stroke, it was wonderful to have my father be able to see the beginning of the approach trail. I have purchased a spot and they will follow our journey back in Ohio. the last week of June both of my sons visited. we visited Amicalola and climbed the stairs.

Subman and I have been hiking daily on a pretty consistent basis. they range from 4.5 to 7.5 miles in length. We are trying to build our strength and endurance, and for myself build a few calluses! we have also been trying to shed a few extra pounds that crept up on us throughout the winter. while on our hikes, we talk about our expectations for our hike and debate the gear we will take with us. how we will utilize each piece and more importantly who will carry it. lol.?? We are pretty much on the same page for expectations and seem to keep pace with each other well.

She gets 4 and sometimes 5 days off at a time since she works 12 hour shifts at a hospital. Now since we live so close to Springer we will start anytime after 1 January 2016 and hike on her days off as long as we have a good weather window.

Being given the opportunity to Thru hike in 2016. So many variables falling into place. That we are Financially able to pay for our hike and maintain what responsibilities we have at home. Having each other to keep us company on the adventure of our lives.Having the support of our families and friends. All of these things are blessings!I am amazed at how many different ways we can do our hike. I'm so excited I can't wait to start. We keep tossing around the idea of starting Jan 1st. As you will probably find out I'm a cold weenie. When the thought of starting in Jan comes up I beat it back down by screaming ""are you nuts"" to myself. So the debate continues.we will watch the weather and decide what works best for us. both Sub and I like the idea of taking off at Springer and we keep on going until we reach Katadhin!If any of you are going to be early starters let us know we are near Springer if we can help??",,Home,"Nov 23, Mon",0
Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517915,"Suds here, It has been steadily raining here for the past two days. To fight the gloomy overcast skies Sub and I hit the Lake trail. Both days we hiked the 4 mile Amadahy Trail around Carter's Lake in the rain.It was a very reassuring experience, since we have the gear we plan to hike with, I know that my gear will stay dry. I had switched my garbage bag liner for a Z-Paks cuben fiber pack liner. It worked beautifully! Most reassuring was my toilet paper which stayed dry in two ziploc baggies. I belive I can do a wet day or two on the trail. I did get a blister under the callus on my little toe. I believe I will try out Luekotape next, it comes more highly recommended than my go to, duct tape. Sub and I will continue to squeeze in hikes until we take off on our adventure!

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518888,"The last two days were frustrating getting Mingo up to Amicalola. The plan was to hike with him to Neels Gap. After shuttling my truck up to Neels we had engine trouble but left it there not knowing if we would be able to drive it home. Also Suds got sick that night and was heart broken she wouldn't be able to hike up to Springer and bring in the New Year. After dropping off Mingo and getting him on his way we drove back up to Neels and thankfully got the truck back to my mechanic in Ellijay. We also got Suds repaired at a walk in Clinic in Blairsville where we were fortunate enough to meet Winkle and her Husband Greg. Awesome people that I'm sure we will get to know better in the future.The weather is going to be so nice for the next week we want to start our Thru-Hike now.We hope to go out and hook up with Mingo after Suds feels better.

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520564,"We started off Sat. the 30th for a 27 mile trek. The Weather was just above freezing, and we hit snow on the ground about a mile South of Siler Bald. Hiking in snow is a new concept to me, and a lot Harder! I fell only once as we made our way to Wayah Shelter. After we arrived at the shelter, and seeing that the snow would make staying in the shelter a better alternative, I began apprehensively to set up. I had never stayed in a shelter before, we have always tented. We meet Two Tone and Ireland, 2 Northbounders who started early and, we were later joined by Okra and Chris. We had a pleasant evening and settled in early. Before long the mice began to make their rounds, scurrying nearby, Since I didn't see or feel anything I was able to block the scurrying out of my mind and rest well enough. after watching the sunrise we are off towards NOC, a 16 mile hike that was snow covered until Wesser Shelter. We enjoyed the amazing views off of Wesser Tower, and on both sides of the Ridge leading up to jump off point. we arrived just as daylight faded at Rufus Morgan Shelter where we were greeted with a welcoming fire and a group of 5 gentleman enjoying the fellowship of well forged frienships. We slept well that night, exhausted from the snowy trek. 
After a night of rest and a few sprinkles we took off for the easy 1 mile stroll into NOC, this completed the 4 mile downhill into NOC that we had started the night before. thankful that we had brought our Cho-pat knee braces. After Arriving at NOC we were greeted by our trail angel Trail Chef. he picked us up took us for lunch and returned us to Winding Stair Gap. Thank you Trail Chef you were a very welcomed smile!
after arriving in Ellijay we visited with another trail angel Grambo, she had watched our dog Pepper for us. I don't know what is most amazing the trail or the people who you discover on it. I'll take both!",,NOC,"Feb 01, Mon",0

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521551,"We woke up in a nice warm hotel room at Mulls motel this morning. We had a pleasant evening with warm showers, foot soakings, and eating at Daniels AYCE. Met the 2 peas, Moon beam and Big Cyprus. Really enjoyed meeting another couple from the trail, They were also staying at Mulls.At Dinner the talk turned to the impending wet and cold weather. Some of us had trail wounds, I was nursing blisters on both feet, and Rabbit had a broken finger that had his ring forming a tourniquet around it. After mulling over our options of what to do next we have decided to accept an offer from Trail Chef and his gracious wife Judy, to layover a few days in their home in Franklin. We will tend to our wounds there and await the arrival of our neos hiking overboots. the boots will help keep my blistered feet dry in the impending snow and slush. 
A little note on the emotional side, Subman has been so inspiring and understanding from day one. the trip started out very tiring as I tried desperately to find my trail legs. I enjoyed seeing the little hearts drawn on the trail by my Love, and yes I knew I was where I was supposed to be, and with whom I'm supposed to be with. Sub is very in tune to the early struggles of the trail. It is like he has a sixth sense of when to just show up, or just to walk a little closer that day. All of this is part of my journey.

Their place is so comfortable. We had the best nights sleep since starting this trip. Suds has been soaking her feet and they're healing nicely. Rabbit has been icing his hand and improving also. We explored Franklin today and the first stop was the library, what a beautiful resource! We were able to check out trail flicks, Southbounders and Into the Wild, for movies and popcorn tonight. We enjoyed a great lunch at Kountry Kitchen located near the Budget Inn. We then went to the outfitter, 76 Outdoor. I found some neon green crocs for camp shoes and Rabbit is sporting a new pair of trekking shoes. Subman does what he does best, and yogied a pair of shoes from the sales Representative. Sub is just ready to get back out there. Watching the impending storm brewing potential tornados turned our thoughts to how Papa Monkey is doing. He made his first day goal, and got to Standing Indian shelter. We hope he makes out good today. The plan is to get back on at Dicks Creek Gap Thursday morning and aim for Muskrat Creek shelter.

Took a photo op and proceeded up courthouse bald. The higher we climbed the heavier the cold wind and snow blew. Suds was chugging along but never experienced anything like it and was not a happy hiker. Dipped down to Sassafras gap and climbed back up to Muskrat Creek shelter where I made some hot soup and tried to warm up. It was probably mid twenties and Suds was a little scared. As you can tell Suds is not a cold weather person. I handle the cold alot better plus have more experience hiking in it. We decided to push on to Standing Indian shelter. When we finally got there we were very cold and tired. Approaching the shelter we noticed a tent set up inside taking up one third of it. Rabbit and Taylor were also setup leaving maybe one more spot. I spoke up to the occupants and said that wasn't cool in the best way I could. Thankfully they moved the tent closer to the wall opening up enough room for Suds and I but it was very tight. Two more showed up and had to tent out in the snow. Suds did NOT have a good night as it dropped into the hight teens with some snow blowing into the Shelter. Of course
We had frozen water so had to be proactive with anything that can Freeze.

After a harrowing experience, of very low temperature and Roaring winds, at Standing Indian Shelter, I was going home! In fact I was never hiking again!I felt like Sub was on a rescue mission, he was doing everything. I was unable to function. I entertained the fact that without Sub I would be dead. Sub didn't want to talk about it til we were off trail.I even tried to entice him with "" let's go home, get the subaru and travel to all the Nat'l parks"", another of our trips on our bucket list. It was a good sign he winked and said that's an idea. Such a good man, knowing when not to debate. So the morning brought sunshine, dying winds, and beautiful landscapes of snow. After visiting a couple of vista's of amazing views I remembered why I'm here, what an amazing masterpiece. After climbing Albert Mountain the plan evolved to get to Rock Gap for a rescue, I was dying after climbing Standing Indian Mt.and Mt Albert, I was tired! going to Rock Gap meant traveling almost 20 miles in the snow! My biggest day was almost 18 miles on a nice day??
But Rock Gap meant a ride back to Trail Chef's wonderful refuge and kindness. Somehow I did the 19.8 miles and cried when I saw Trail Chef walking up the trail. I hugged him so hard, what a special Trail Angel. His warm car was supplied with drinks and hot chocolate, it felt like heaven.

I'm excited because today we are climbing Clingmans Dome, The highest elevation on the AT! The trail was slippery, the new snow was a blessing in disguise allowing us to grip the trail a little better. We hiked the 10 miles to Clingmans Dome through Alpine Forest and beautiful sunshine, needless to say our spirits were high. We found trail magic at Double Springs Shelter in the form of 2 ice cold Coors Light beers, Carbs for climbing up to Clingmans Dome!We had a beautiful day at Clingmans with our Trail Family, Rabbit, Papa and Halme wolfe, and most recently Blues Brother, who Rabbit had met at the beginning of his hike at the Hike Inn in Dahlonega. you could see forever!We climbed down Clingmans slippery slopes through the fresh smelling pines and 3 miles later arrived at Mt Collins Shelter. after a great meal and a warm fire we were all settled in at 6pm hiker midnight.","Derrick Knob

The Weather is going to be fantastic, we are so fortunate! I have not had much of an appetite while out so carbing up and getting some vitamins is on the list of things to do. we resupplied at Walgreens and Subman needed some new tips for his poles at NOC.

The saddest part of this town stay is that Rabbit , Blues Brother, PAPA & Halme wolf left this morning as we chose to spend a zero in town. We will miss them but have hopes of catching up with them again. They have been texting us updates on the trail conditions which is very helpful. Rabbit is such a strong hiker, he and Blues youth will do very well.

The Tower was very cool and both Subman and I both thought this would make an awesome camping spot! My feet were hurting and Subman didnt want me to do the long downhill to Davenport Gap Shelter. The Norovirus rumors also didnt make the Shelter very appealling. While hanging out at the tower several day hikers came and went. One group in particular was interesting. It was a group of 3 college aged girls who had interesting plans. As Subman walked a little ways from the tower, they decided to take a topless photo. After their photo was taken, they hung around. Subman had returned to the tower and rejoined us on the balcony. After talking a few moments they decided to take moon shots of themselves and didn't care if Subman watched!

Someone was doing Trail Magic at Sams gap! It was 2.4 miles to get there and Trail Chef Had to leave in an hour. Downhill was killer for me and I was slow, no way could we make it to see his smiling face. Trail Chef had it covered, he hid the mother lode in a couple of pines for us.

This isn't the way I hike. there it was out on the table, it was said outloud. My feet issues may end our Hike. That thought from the back of my mind was staring right in front of me. Subman didn't want to see me hurting anymore. We had some issues to discuss. 
When we got to the shelter I walked off cried a little out of frustration. We had made so many sacrifices to get here! But Sub was right, we had to come up with something. We had asked Grambo to overnight more meloxicam and my orthopedic inserts to Uncle Johnny's when we were on Big Bald. She was on it, but being a weekend they wouldn't get there til Monday. knowing this, we decided we will get to Uncle Johnny's and regroup.

We climbed out of Erwin and the further up we went more snow was present. we had a light dusting of snow that had already fallen the night before and chilly temps to hike in. Our plan was to go 8 miles and get out of town, but not so high up we would catch the colder high altitudes. The 8 miles was a good distance to test how my feet would hold up. I am glad to report my feet are great and I experienced no pain today! I got to wear my new Oboz shoes and they are working out fine. So so far feet are working out perfect. Yea, You guys won't have to read about my aching feet so much!
Our thinking was to get in 8 miles to set us up at the base of Roan Mtn Tuesday night. this way we can climb Roans 6000 ft. altitude on Wed. when the best weather is predicted. There probably will still be snow ad ice up there to slosh around in tho. It also places us near some hostels for options if the weather turns bad like predicted on Thursday.

I reminded myself we will see them again and hoped they hiked slowly so we could catch up. We stopped at MoJo's on the way back to the hostel and someone came up that I could almost recognize... It was Spirit of 76!!! she looked wonderful although she had lost more than a few pounds. We got reaquainted with hugs and smiles and swapped info so we could meet up later. After we said goodbye to 2 peas and Fiber I took a little nap before going to the newly opened restaurant, Bobo McFarland.

Green Hornet comes in soaked from the rain, Shortly after, Lookout who we haven't seen since Atkins, comes in completely drenched . She had gotten caught in the storm and hail on Bluff Mountain. After everyone got dried off and settled in we listened to the frogs singing us to sleep.The picture today is one that Green Hornet shared of the storm he was in on Bluff Mountain.","Glasgow VA

We crossed many Springs and swollen rivers from last night's rain. One stream was so swollen it flowed over the rocks used for crossing. We removed our shoes and socks, putting on our crocs we forded our first River crossing. It was a lot of fun and the water felt great on our feet! we continued on to Brown Mountain Creek Shelter where we had a hot lunch and we're later joined by Shellback. We needed all the energy our hot lunched provided to climb the 2700ft climb to Bald Knob! See Virginia is not flat.
We Then climbed up and over Cole Mountain. Cole Mt. was Beautiful with fields mowed and views that go on forever. We went down into Hog Camp gap and set up camp for tonight. Sub walked a mile and a half to a hostel to get more food, this will give us enough food to get to Waynesboro now.","Punch bowl Shelter

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531545,"We awoke in the meadow with the sun rising in the east and cloudy skies in the west. We didn't have a major climb until the 800ft into the Priest Shelter.
There was plenty of water on the trail after the rain the past few days. We stopped at the Seeley-Woodworth Shelter and made salami and cheese wraps to fuel up for the climb. We made the climb by 2pm, the trail was very hiker friendly except for the area around Spy Rock. Somehow my expert hiking guide got off trail and went to the right, to an off trail,that led to this humongous rock outcropping. We started up with packs and poles. Halfway up the scramble it became a solid rock wall. Up scrambles Subman and I stare up in disbelief! I said no way I quess my hike ends here. I went back down as Sub looked for blazes on top. After backtracking and looking at AWOLS guide again, I found the trail that went off to the left and that the trail we took was to Spy Rock. Thankfully I could continue my hike. Now, Subman needed to get back down. I stood at the bottom and prayed that God would watch over him, worried to death, and he scrambles down with a ""Boy that was fun"". Back on trail, we continue toward the Priest Shelter. We encountered 4 section hikers from New England. We enjoyed chatting a while then continued on to the shelter. It was fun reading the confessions in the logbook at the shelter as we had hot soup for a second lunch. We decided to push on to the next Shelter for a couple of reasons. It was supposed to rain tonight and all of the next day.The climb down from the priest would be slippery in the rain. Secondly there was a 3000ft climb the next day, making it to the Harper Creek Shelter would knock out the first 1000ft of that climb. We made it to the Harper Creek Shelter by 7pm and fixed a quick dinner found room in the shelter and snuggled in for a dry night.","Hog Camp Gap campsite

At first it was a little rain and we climbed in our t-shirts. the rain cooled us as we climbed the remaining 2000ft of Three Ridges Mountain. It was a tough climb with many rock scrambles across the trail. As we climbed fog engulf the mountain and the view was limited. The higher we climbed the colder we got, and the wind blew the rain into sleet and we put on our rain gear and ski gloves (thankful we still had them). We had planned on getting into Waynesboro Friday afternoon. We began entertaining the idea of getting off trail and doing our town chores while it was raining. At this point we were soaked and getting very cold. We made it to Maupin Field Shelter and looked at the guide for options. There was no cell service at the shelter so we continued on down the trail toward Reed's Gap. We called Royal Oaks Hostel and there was no rooms or cabins available. We were standing in the freezing rain trying to get calls out to get a ride to Waynesboro. I had met a Section Hiker, named Nightengale at the four pines hostel that I enjoyed talking with. We had exchanged contact info and she was from Waynesboro. I called her and God answered our prayers for a Trail Angel. She could be there in an hour. We had about a mile to go to get to Reed's Gap. We arrived a little early so we walked laps in the parking area to keep warm. Soon our ride was there with the car heated and a smile. Although I don't think any smile could have been bigger than ours, getting into the warm car with heated seats!

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531747,"Today we had to leave our hotel room because almost every room was booked in Waynesboro for a college graduation. The graduation and Rainy hiking weather made for scarce lodging. Subman had been texting AK and PaPa Monkey to find they had found a bunk at Stanimals Hostel. I had marked the hostel as closed, but unknowingly it was reopened the first of May. This was a blessing because the only room we could find was 175$ at the Holiday Inn Express. We called Stanimals and he could pick us up in about an hour. We used the hour to walk to Walmart for our resupply. we put it in our backpacks and was ready for our pickup. Stanimals Hostel is in a beautiful neighborhood and when we got there Subman. the forever Yogi, offered to cut the grass for stay. Stanimals said deal and we saved even more money. While Sub was mowing Outside I was going through our resupply and gear inside getting us ready to hike out in the morning. After we completed our chores we went to E&J Pub that was nearby, I had Fish and Chips, and Sub had Ranch Chicken wings. We both had our favorite adult beverages, a Margarita for me, and Subs OJ and Southern Comfort. We were accompanied by Rocky Cat, who is from Germany, We had a nice time enjoying each other's company. We later found out it was Rocky Cats' Birthday today. AK came by and he had a dessert. We wrapped it up and began to walk back to the hostel in the still falling rain. We spied an ice cream shop and I got a blackberry cone and Sub got his favorite cone, vanilla with chocolate sprinkles. they were so good!
Shortly we were back at the hostel. We were taking naps on our bunks when the house got quite, everyone had gone to Mings, the AYCE Chinese restaurant in town. Just a few of us remained to rest up. When everyone returned we all were getting settled in and Sub mentioned a bite that has been kinda angry for awhile. We made plans to see how it looked after putting Epsom salts on it overnight. We may have to have it looked at before heading out to the trail tomorrow. Being in town it would be smarter to go to the clinic here, than having a problem on the trail and not being able to get to a clinic. Obviously we are bored because an infected bite story was quickly teased into an amputation of his leg at Subman's expense. After a few good laughs it was lights out, here tonight was Papa Monkey, AK, Diggity Do, Rocky Cat, Oso, Clean Skittles, Dutch Oven, Ron Jon, Cam and a few more. A full house!","Reed's Gap

The trail was pretty easy, but there were many rock scrambles, and plenty of water on the trail from the recent rains. We both were in a Funk coming from town, but we just kept on putting one foot in front of the other. We stopped for a pepperoni & cheese wrap and rested on a huge rock by the trail. It was Saturday so there were many day hikers out enjoying the perfect hiking weather. We made the little climb up Humpback Mountain and was rewarded with magnificent views of the ridges and valleys below. We continued on and arrived at the Paul C. Wolfe Shelter before we knew it. There was a marble bench in front of the Shelter facing the falls that cascaded in front of the shelter. We rested there while talking to a few hikers who past by. Subman's infected bite had been bothering him and was still very red. We talked about going to urgent care to get it checked out. Rockfish Gap would be the only place in the near future to get into town easily. As we were hiking I tripped on a rock or root, and fell on my right knee. I banged it up pretty good and had a nice area of road rash on the side of my knee. by the time we got to Rockfish Gap my knee was killing me. We were going to camp just before getting into Rockfish Gap, but there were no areas flat enough available. So after looking at the map, we asked a local guy which way to Waynesboro, and he offered us a ride into Waynesboro in the back of his truck. we were dropped off across from the quality Inn.

Sub was given antibiotics for Cellulitis so hopefully it will start clearing up in the next couple of days. My bruised knee is not feeling as bad as I thought it would, and the scrapes look pretty good after an Epsom salts soak last night. We made the decision to stay in Waynesboro. Subman took me to Mings Chinese Buffet with all you can eat crab legs to help me celebrate Mother's Day. It was also nice to hear from my Boys! I love their support and encouragement.

We kept our eyes open for wildlife but only saw 4 rabbits. We stopped by a spring and made pepperoni and cheese wraps. We quickly moved on so we could make it to camp before the predicted rain.

We would be stopping at the Loft mountain campstore. We couldn't stop thinking about the hot dogs and snacks we were going to get. The camp store was a welcome oasis from the over cast drizzly day. As we continued on we spotted a deer that blended so well with the forest foliage we almost missed it. We started having 500ft ups and downs and came past Simmons Gap, There we met some trail maintainers replacing blazes of the burnt area of Powell Gap. One maintainer named Old Fat Dad had fun size snickers in his back pack for thru hiker trail magic! From now on I will be very inquisitive as to what is in the backpacks of the trail maintainers we encounter. We past through the mile or two of burnt area from the recent wildfire. It was very eerie with the fog weaving among the burnt Land. Stunningly silent and sad. The animals gone to find new homes. This was the only evidence of the wildfires we could see from the trail. We climbed halfway up Hightop Mountain to the Hut and gave each other a high five for back to back 20 mile days.

It had wonderful overlooking views of the town of Luray.We returned to the trail and crossed Thornton Gap. We stopped for a snack and shared some wine, since we planned to eat later at Elkwallow Wayside. One thing about the waysides they have kind of thrown us out of sync with our routine. We are light because we are not carrying as much food, but you tend to center your day around getting to them. I like our routine better, and find I do better mentally with it.We continued north from Thornton Gap for about 2 miles and something caught my eye. I looked to the right and about 200ft off the trail, a pretty nice sized bear was watching me! I whispered/shouted ""bear, bear, bear"" to Subman and we just stood there looking at the bear. He decided he was not interested in us and put his head back down to continue his nap. It was awesome to see a bear in their own habitat. It was an uneventful encounter, and that was Ok with us!We contined on elated with our sighting.

We stopped on the way back to the hotel at a deli and had fresh sandwiches for lunch, they were great. Luray is a good ole boy town, I wouldnt judge it as Hiker friendly. good luck getting a ride and any shuttles are way overpriced (ie 80$ for 17 miles). the outfitter was limited. The Open Arms Hostel was reasonable with shuttles by donation (about 1$ per mile).

It looked like it enclosed the Virginia 4-H center. The fence even continued after crossing VA 602. We made a 1000ft climb and rolled back down to Jim and Molly Denton Shelter.

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534495,"we were up and at a great breakfast with Barnyard and Spitless at 730am. Barnyard drove us the half hour to the trailhead at Snickers Gap. We were so thankful of everything our trail Angels had done for us in the past 24 hours, the words were hardly enough to express it. We hugged and walked off into the rain. The rain, was never ending. At first it was not so bad, Then it became a steady rain with some wind that sent a chill to our bodies. Subman had fallen a couple of times, and I had to many near misses to count. By the time we got to the blue blazes of the Blackburn AT Center there was no question, we were going in to dry out! We were soaked through. When we got to the center A sign said make yourself at home in the bunkhouse, so we went up to check it out. We started a fire and changed into warm dry clothes and hung our dripping wet clothes to dry by the fire. The fire felt so warm after the chilly wet 50° temps outside. By this time Trail Boss and Sandi, the caretakers had arrived, and invited us to have a cup of hot chocolate, it tasted so good and warm! As we were talking 5 thru hikers came on to the veranda soaking wet and had called for someone to come and pick them up. While they were getting a little dry and waiting for their ride we returned to the bunkhouse and warm fire. there were 2 more thru hikers there, Toxic Foot and Robin, a very nice German couple. They quickly got out of their wet things and hung them by the fire. We were supposed to meet a Trail Angel ""the Real Deal"" at Keys Gap today but we did not make it that far. Our Trail Angel came to the Blackburn AT Center to meet us and share a lot of goodies! ""Real Deal"" had been reading our journal and wanted to gift us with trail magic. She brought us yummy egg sandwiches, Sodas, wine, fresh fruit, delicious oatmeal and Chocolate cookies, and various treats! It was a great way to pass the rainy afternoon. As we were chatting Julie came in dripping wet. After getting dry clothes on and settled in she was delighted to share in the trail magic our trail angel had brought. There are 5 of us settled in the bunkhouse tonight. We are warm and dry. We have had our spirits lifted by trail magic from Real Deal! As the rain continues outside we are comfortable and safe in the Bunkhouse! Thank You! ReaL Deal for driving so far and bringing the awesome food and drinks. We loved meeting you and talking this afternoon! you have the kindest heart so dont ever change!","Snickers Gap

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534639,"It was still nice and toasty in the cabin. Subman brought me coffee and we started getting our things together for an early start. It was pretty foggy, but we saw some deer off in the distance and a bear paw print in the muddy trail. We had 13 miles to get into Harper's Ferry. The trail from the Blackburn center was rocky but pretty flat. When we got to Keys Gap Moose was getting dropped off to hike into Harper's Ferry. When we got close to Harpers Ferry we could see the beautiful Potomac River. It was bursting at the seams from all the recent rains. We crossed it by walking beside HWY 340. Trucks would blow their horns and the excitement grew within us. We took the blue blaze to the ATC headquarters and received our numbers as Thru hikers passing through Harpers Ferry. We then returned to the AT and followed it into old town with all the historical buildings. We ate lunch at a deli and walked out of town towards the Ed Garvey shelter. It began to rain as we passed by a canal that was filled with many turtles hanging out on logs in algea filled water. We climbed the Weverton cliffs and ran into muddy, sloppy trail until we reached the Shelter. There is a youth group of about 10 young people tenting near the shelter. In the shelter is New Dave, Nova, Section hikers Rosemary and Jason, and us. We are looking forward to the great weather tomorrow.","Blackburn AT Center

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534888,"I awoke to a view looking out over the mountain with Submans silhouette in the sunrise. He was making his coffee, I love how he enjoys his quite mornings. We are slow gathering our things. We have easy trail and a shorter distance than usual to go today. We are meeting our neighbors from Carter's Lake at Turner's Gap today.
    Cliff and Doris live just up the hill from us, and have watched us walk by their house on our way to hike the lake trail for almost two years with our packs on. We always enjoy waving or stopping by the porch to chat and enjoy Doris' beautiful Flowers. Their Dog Laura always greets us as we go by. Cliff grew up in Damascus MD and they were in town to celebrate his Sisters 90th birthday! Who would have thought we would be enjoying their company all the way up north in MD. We took off on the trail by 7am, the mud continued with quite a bit of rocks thrown in for good measure. Within about 3 miles we came up to Gathland State Park. This place is beautiful with rock homes built in 1884. The Army War Correspondent Monument commemorating those War Correspondents that died while in Service to their country is pretty awesome, as it lets you take in the battlefield through the arch. Subman and I stopped at the pavilion and ate an early lunch and took in the view of the grounds. Their was a group of about 15 college students there also. They were taking a Leave No Trace backpacking class. We pushed on up the trail towards White Rock Cliff. On the way up I stopped to talk with another lady from the Facebook Womens Site. Turtle was Thru Hiking the AT with sections, flipflops and whatever else it takes and plans to finish this fall. I loved talking with her about some really neat places near home to hike. Subman was resting at the top of White Rock when I caught up to him, He was talking with a hiker who had gotten on the AT at Harpers Ferry, I had talked to Ramone at the Shelter last night. By the time he and Subman had finished talking, Ramone had a new trail name, ""Laces"". Ramone had colorful orange laces in his shoes, He liked the name so Laces it is.We made it to Turners Gap around 12:30. Doris met us at the trail, We were wondering if she would hike in some because she has hiked all of the GA section of the AT before! After hugs and smiles, We took off to the hotel in Fredrick MD, We got our room and took showers and got our laundry done pronto. Cliff had a favorite restaurant, ""Dutches Daughter"", that he wanted to treat us to. What a treat it was, just baked bread, Margaritas all around! Subman had a steak that melted in your mouth and I had Maryland Crabcakes. This place was NICE, one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at. After visiting for a while we turned in. It was so nice to see them and very generous of them to include a couple of smelly hikers in their vacation. Now they are not only friends but official Trail Angels too! We Cant wait to swap stories on the front porch when we get home.","Ed Garvey Shelter

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535048,"We had a wonderful breakfast at the hotel then Cliff and Doris drove us back to Turners Gap. Fueled by all that great food we made pretty good time through nice trail. We followed the trail up Monument State park. It was a rock tower tribute to George Washington. We wandered through a few neighborhoods and crossed I-70 on a footbridge that spanned over the highway. At the other end of the bridge Burkee was delivering sweet trail magic of tasty cakes and Sodas. We stopped for a while and talked. Lone Ranger with his Dog Scout came by going Sobo. Half App who lives in Harpers Ferry was delivering 2 Section Hikers to the trail head. After socializing we continued on down the trail. We crossed over a few rock scrambles and hay fields and began a descent into Warner Gap Hollow. It was the end of our day and we were almost to Raven Rock Shelter. When we got to the road we were surprised by our Maryland Trail Angel, Real Deal. She had watched our spot link to find us and brought cold drinks, fruit, Greek Sub sandwiches with 2 warm pies for dessert! also some of the best fudge ever. The best part was I could enjoy it all and not feel guilty. We had put in a pretty good day, and with dinner done now, we decided to go a little past the shelter. We took a blue blaze to a loop trail and found a nice spot tucked into the woods. We will try to catch the sunrise at the view spot in the morning. Thank you to our trail Angels for taking the time and effort in making us feel so special!","Turners Gap

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535194,"If we weren't awake when we first took off we were very abruptly kicked into hiking mode. The down to Pen Mar park was nothing but a boulder field that you could hardly follow a trail. There were little red flags to follow if you could find them. We picked our way down to the bottom and walked into Pen Mar Park. The park was beautiful and It had restrooms and trash cans. we washed up and relaxed eating a snack while taking in the view on the benches. Not so long after the park we entered the North, by crossing the Mason Dixon Line. We followed an easy trail until around noon when we hit a 1000ft climb in the afternoon heat. We drank almost all of our water but still had 8 miles to go for water and it was pretty hot. Subman found a water source not in the guide at about 5 miles, thank God. Without God and Subman Im sure I would never make it to Maine!
We decided to go the 3 more miles past the last Shelter to the Trail of Hope Hostel, Subman had a pair of shoes mailed to him there. Just past the shelter there were huge rock scrambles. The thing about the trail that made no sense was the fact it took you from the forest floor up to a rock scramble then back down to the forest floor. It was sensless almost like, ""you're in Pennsylvania now so you must do rocks!"" We made it to the Hostel by 6pm tired and thirsty but fine. The Trail of Hope is an awesome Hostel. They have thought of everything you might need. The people are kind and friendly it is a happy place!","Stealth camp on High Rock Loop

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535301,"We got a lazy start this morning and didn't get on the trail til 9am. We passed through Caledonia State park and began our largest climb for the day.After climbing half of the 1000ft climb we arrived at Quarry Gap Shelters. This shelter was beautiful and immaculate, it had hanging flower baskets adorning the eaves of the shelter and a landscaped spring water source. We continued on after filling our water bottles. It was going to be hot today and we were determined to carry more water with us. Carrying more water meant heavier packs, but it was necessary. After the climb it was pretty easy, flat trail with only an occasional rocky area. After 6 miles we came to Birch Run Shelters. We watered up again and talked with a German lady named Snowball, who was section hiking. Birch Run was beautiful and relaxing, but we decided to push on with our plan to go to Toms Run Shelter which was another 6.2 miles. In just 2.5 miles we passed the physical halfway mark on the trail! from now on we were on our way home. When we were half a mile from Toms Run Shelter we came across about a dozen Gatorades chilling in a stream. Awesome trail magic on this hot day. We got to Toms Run Shelter before the thunder and rain that threatened to fall. Washed up in the Spring. Ate dinner and settled in for the night. there is a youth group of 5 tenting and Pinecone Sitter, Orbit and Mom in the shelter tonight.","Trail of Hope Hostel

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535478,"We were on the trail by 6:45am a little early. I didn't eat breakfast so I would have room for the half gallon Ice Cream Challenge just three miles up the road. I thought about it all night and I was going to get Neopolitan to honor my Dad. My Dad taught me everything I know about eating ice cream. Neopolitan is his favorite Kind. I asked Subman what he was going to choose, He said Vanilla something. we walked the 3 easy miles to Pine Grove Furnace. Our first stop was the Ironmasters Mansion Hostel. We talked to the Innkeeper, Full Circle, about the history of the building and He stamped my passport book. Right next to the hostel is the general store. We got out our spoons and chose our ice cream. Subman picked Cookies and Cream, I got my Neopolatin. We saw Mom, Orbit, Pinecone Sitter and Iceman there to cheer us on. Subman slowed down and was done about a quarter into the challenge. I on the other hand was just warming up! Yes I finished it! Subman was so proud of me. We got sandwiches to pack out and went up the road to the AT Museum. The museum was pretty neat, it has Earl Shaffers shelter reconstructed with several of his gear pieces displayed. It also has the First Katadin sign. One sign I thought was cool was one referring to Mt. Oglethorpe as the southern terminus of the AT. We wound our way through the rest of Pine Grove Furnace where a lot of people were kicking off their Memorial Day festivities. We were on pretty easy trail after a short climb from the park. Water was a little scarce but we had filled up at the General Store. I thought we would see more section hikers but just a few were about, going SOBO. We made it to Hunters Run RD. It was pretty hot out so we decided to walk to the General Merchandise Store, only 0.2 off the trail, to get cold cokes. While Subman went in to get us cold drinks, I began talking to an employee on the front porch. She told me about the Holly Inn and that they would pick us up and return us back to the trail in the morning. Within an hour Subman and I were showered and having drinks at the Holly Inn Tavern. It has been a relaxing day. Thought for the day...Sieze the moment!","Toms Run Shelter

We had a great stay at the Holly Inn and were well rested. We started out for Boiling Springs it was only 11 miles but we needed to stop there. It would have been 26 miles before we could camp or go to a shelter. there is no camping from Boiling Springs to Darlington Shelter. We would get to Boiling springs and spend the night, then do the 14 miles the next day.We walked through flat forest with a couple of streams with foot bridges, then we went up 500ft to some rocky outcroppings. The trail weaves us through two rock mazes that were fun to work through. We watered up in a nice stream then went over 4 nice size ups and downs that spit us out on the edge of a cornfield that lead us into Boiling Springs. On the edge of town there is a free AT campground. The campground looked ok but we thought we could find someplace with a little character in town. We walked through town past all the families picnicing, fishing, and playing in the parks. Towns People were lined up for the Memorial Parade and ceremony, flags were flying, Everyone was smiling, Just like when I was growing up in the little town of Bellville Ohio. After stopping in at the ATC office, We went to an Italian restraunt and had a great salad and sub sandwiches. We wanted to stay at the Allenberry Resort, they had a hiker special in the AT guide. When we got there (0.4miles) the office was closed and there was no way to get a room. Instead of walking the couple miles back to the campground, We called Cindy from the Holly Inn. Cindy came and picked us up, and took us back to the Holly Inn. We will leave Boiling Springs tomorrow and get at least to Darlington Shelter.","Holly Inn

We thanked Cindy from the Holly Inn for the ride and took off on the flat trail leaving Boiling Springs. The trail is muddy and slippery from last nights rains. The trail winds around several farm fields. The wheat heads bring to mind the song America the Beautiful. My mind wonders to thoughts of our Memorial Day. Thankful to all those who died giving this gift to me. Seeing the flag flying on Submans pack almost brought tears to my eyes as I sang Im proud to be an American in my head. We are so blessed! Within 10 miles it was just past noon and we stopped at the Scott Farm Trail ATC Crew HQ to fix lunch. there were quite a few cars there and we thought perhaps there was a picnic going on, but no such luck. A ridge runner named JP introduced himself, he was just hanging out on his day off. We washed the mud from our legs and hand washed our socks from the sloppy trail. Subman made us some soup with tuna. As we were relaxing Iceman pulled in. It was nice to see a familiar face. Even better a familiar face that has ice cold sodas to share! Thank You Iceman for the trail magic. after our nice lunch we pushed on towards the Shelter. At the top of the 500ft climb there is a huge stone bench that looks out over the Cumberland Valley that we had just passed through. What an awesome view! We arrived at the Darlington Shelter by 3pm and decided to stay when we found the unreliable water source flowing fine. As Subman was putting up our tent, Dennis Hurley and his daughter came in. Dennis is from Carlisle nearby and keeps an eye on the shelter. He was very nice to talk to and knew quite a bit about the trail since he helps maintain and build trail in the area. Dennis also provided our second trail magic of the day. He brought a recharger for our phones and a douple sized snicker bar for each of us! Thank you for the trail magic Dennis and a HUGE thank you for your work on the AT, we enjoy and appreciate it! We said our goodbyes as Dennis packed up miscellaneous items and trash left at the shelter to pack it out. We ate our Spaghetti dinner and as we were finishing, Renaldo, who is doing a flip-flop thru hike, came in. We retired to our tent and by 6pm the clouds darkened and the thunder began to roll.

The trail took us into some oat fields that were shoulder high in height . I put on my zpak rain kilt, it worked great, but my socks and shoes were soaked. We were covered in oat germ and Submans shorts were soaked also. We saw a deer running through the fields, bounding leaps to clear the high oats. We climbed up to a ridge area and although it was rocky. it was not as rocky as I thought it would be. We got into Duncannon around 1pm. Stopping at the Doyle Hotel, we both ordered burgers and shared an order of fries. We received the replacement parts for my treking poles from Leki. I also received a letter from my neice Kayla. We enjoyed talking to Vicki, one of the owners, and Trail Angel Mary came in for a visit. It was fun talking and laughing with these ladies. We decided we would leave Duncannon and go to the first shelter out of town. Although it was just 6 miles it was a pretty gnarly climb up 1000ft with ridge walking on massive rocks. We arrived at Clark's Ferry Shelter and spied a nice tent site before going up the hill to the shelter. we got all settled in and washed up a bit.

The trail was pretty level with fewer rocks than expected which was a nice surprise. Just a couple miles south of Peter's Mtn Subman had stopped in the trail waiting for me to catch up. Then he said ""snake"" and pointed to the trail. There was a foot long baby rattlesnake   (he looks bigger in the picture because I zoomed in). Subman scooted him off the trail and I made a large arch passing him. Baby or not it was a rattlesnake and where was momma? We got to Peter's Mtn Shelter. Holy Smokes and two step were there. Two step was happy because Subman found his hat on the trail and had brought it to the shelter. Two Steps hat was special because his grandfather gave it to him. Holy Smokes was not feeling well because he had an upper respiratory infection. I shared some sinus medication we had left over from our head colds. After we had wraps for lunch we continued on. We had enough water from the morning, so we didnt have to hike down the 300 steps for water, yay! There was no more water for 6.5 miles. It is very important to carry enough water with the heat of the past few days being in the high 80's.We continued on with a 750 ft climb at the end of our day. After we reached the top we had planned on watering up and finding a place to camp. The first site was pretty buggy so we pushed on to the yellow springs camp site. throughout the day we heard military jets flying nearby. The noise reminded me of what the Navy pilots used to say When I lived on San Juan Island WA. they would just nod and say""The sound of freedom baby"". It made me smile. At 1030pm we were laying in our tent and I was awaken by the sound of taps and could actually here the clamparts of the flag clanking as it was being lowered. I then knew we were near a military base. It was a very sombering sound.","Clark's Ferry Shelter

We climbed the 900ft climb out of Lickdale in the foggy mist sprinkled by the tree rain. It was pretty easy except for the few Rock scrambles that were slippery from the rain. The rocks were beginning to be more plentiful, but still broken up with clear trail. We arrived at the 501 Shelter by 1pm and ate wraps for lunch. We needed a few things from an outfitter and Ive been having reoccuring issues with my plantar facitis courtesy of the Pennsylvania rocks.

The trail was very rocky for the first couple of miles, then the trail mellowed and the forest floor was covered by bright green ferns. It was beautiful! After about 10 miles we came across trail magic provided by Lester, who lives nearby. We quickly enjoyed a treat then continued on. We wanted to get to the next shelter before the young whippersnappers! It is supposed to rain all night from dinnertime on through Sunday so we wanted to sleep in the shelter tonight. It paid off, We went the 15 miles and arrived around 1pm. Shortly after we had lunch, Iceman arrived, he rode his bike up a gravel Rd and hiked into the shelter. He brought us Aqua Mira! We were having a problem finding it. Iceman went to REI and got it for us and also brought us cold cokes, unbelievable. Thank you for your kindness Iceman. We enjoyed your company. We were joined by a day hiker, Ron, who gave us an enormous apple it tasted so good. We also visited with a local named Roger who was out for a day hike. We enjoyed talking about national park trips. Then we heard some boisterous noise coming up to the Shelter. The noise was soon followed by young Boy Scouts most on their first camp! As a mother of two Eagle Scouts I was delighted to see them.

We cautiously came down the steep downhill that was terraced with slippery wet rocks. We got to the Port Clinton Hotel an hour before they opened. So we walked across the street to the Peanut Shop. There was every kind of candy imaginable there, not the place to be when you're a couple of hungry hikers. We bought snacks for our next 4 day hiking section there. The Hotel opened at 11am and we got our room, took Showers, and started Laundry.

The site was down a steep hill but beautiful. We made a hot lunch to power up going over Knife's Edge. The Edge was supposed to be one of the 10 hardest parts of the AT, I was a little worried. Subman reassured me by saying ""I'll be right here with you"". saying a quick prayer, we were off. All went well, I even got a pic! I think Dragon's Tooth was harder though. We continued on to Bake Oven Knob Shelter. There were lots and lots of rock piles. As we were about 1mile from the Shelter, It began to thunder and the skies grew dark. We hustled trying to make it to the Shelter as intermittent showers began mixed with a little hail. It was around 2pm so we ate a snack and took a nap to wait a while on the passing rain.

When he said ""A bear"" I thought he said ""we're there"" and said Wahoo! my hearing is getting worse than his. At the Shelter, there are no tenting spots so we are sleeping in the shelter tonight.

As we crossed the highway to go up Leigh High, two trail Angels had just dropped off a cooler of sodas and cupcakes. after expressing our Thankfulness, we thoroughly enjoyed it! A little further up we talked with a Keystone Trail maintainer, he gave us a description of the trail ahead. Although the maintainer let us know there is an authorized bad weather route, we wanted to white blaze it, so up we went! As long as I didn't look down I was OK. I stayed closed to the rocks and had pretty solid footing the whole way. It felt good having it behind me and I did gain confidence in myself. I still felt that the back side of Dragon's Tooth was harder. Subman on the other hand loves this stuff! He is looking around snapping pictures thoroughly enjoying himself, no fear. The best part of the climb was that we beat the predicted rain and the rocks were not wet. After we got on the other side of Leigh High the trail had been rerouted to an easy mountain side trail. the skies began to cloud up and thunder rolled in the distance. With about a mile to go, the heavens let loose and we were in a downpour. We got to Little Gap Rd and headed the 0.8 miles east to a restaurant in Danielsville, there is also a little store for limited resupply 0.2 mils further. The owners of the restaurant have a Pavillion behind it and let hikers stay if they ask nice. they have water also, which is an issue in this section. We are tenting at the Pavillion tonight and have dried everything out. looks like great weather tomorrow.","George W. Outer bridge Shelter

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537671,"We left the Blue Mountain Drive Inn and got a quick ride back to the trailhead. We were leaving much drier than when we came in. We saw Mom and Orbit getting dropped off also. We were loaded down with water since this stretch was going to be pretty dry or hard to get to. The Weather was a bit chilly but perfect for hiking. The rocks were continuous from the moment we started. You don't dare look away from the trail or you will trip. We went seven miles then Subman was hungry again, so we stopped At Smith Gap Road to have a snack. Mom and Orbit passed by and pressed ahead they had a pretty big day planned. Mechanical Man came by in a car and filled us in on his hostel and trail conditions. He confirmed what two peas had said about no water at the Wind Gap Motel listed in AWOL'S guide. So when we got to Wind Gap we went East to town. We caught a ride with a great guy, Bill and he dropped us off near a gas station that had Hot Dogs and Smart Water bottles. it was time for us to change out our bottles and we needed the water. We caught a ride for the 1 mile uphill to the trail. Which was great since we were carrying 4 liters of water. We were ready to get on trail and have enough water to camp tonight when we saw a spot. Huffing and Puffing up the hill we run into A lady hiker who said hello and asked our names. The more we talked the more we had in common. Kinder, lives in Blairsville GA, near us. After talking for several minutes, we were pretty sure we would meet at the Church hostel the next evening, if all went as planned. We said see you laters and pressed on to find a good tenting spot. About 1.5 miles in there was a huge site with no rocks, so we set up house. it was a cool quite night. just perfect!","Danielsville

We were quickly back on rocks. My feet feel like two very tenderized steaks. My Solomons that were new in the Shenandoahs are beginning to shred around the rubber soles. Within 5 miles we knew we were going up on Rocks, there was a blue blazed bypass trail for Wolf Rocks. Our purist hearts followed the white blazes and we were soon leaping a rock scramble with gorgeous views. Subman suddenly stops in his tracks. Just as he was about to step down he spied a very large rattlesnake sunning himself on the rocks. We made a wide circle and he continued to sleep, which was fine with us! We continued on towards Kirkridge Shelter. We stopped and talked to a Ridge runner named We'll See at Fox Gap. We stopped for lunch at the Shelter and texted Two Peas to get the scoop on Delaware Water Gap. We had less than 7 miles to go to get there. We eased down into town with great trail and saw many day hikers coming up from town. We arrive at the Church of the Mountain Hiker Hostel. We took Showers and got a shuttle from Kenny to Walmart and Laundry. Subman stopped at the outfitter to get a new section of leki pole that bent while traversing the rocks. We stopped at a grill for a drink and nachos before heading back to the hostel. We set up our tent and packaged our resupply, so our town chores are pretty much complete. Outside sitting was a familar face from the AT womens site on Facebook, Ranger had been at the hostel before we arrived. It was great to meet her! When I went into the Hostel, Kinder had return from her day of hiking. We began to talk some more and I was delighted to have someone to reconnect with from near home. We also found we have a mutual friend from Blairsville, Winkle! We talked with others in the hostel and found there is quite a trail journals group here. Check out Nerf66(Stripes), and Pops (male). Stitch was also there sharing awesome turtle cookies her mother sent (I love her Mom, LOL).

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537825,"Today we decided to Zero at the Church Hostel. I slept in til 8am and Sub was waiting to go to the Bakery down the road. I had a piece of apple pie and Sub had a beautiful pastry filled with barvarian creme. We walked back to the Hostel to wait for the outfitters to open at ten. I needed a new air mattress, again my Big Agnes mattress was deflating a couple times a night. I decided to let Big Agnes send my replacement home and bought a Therma rest Xlite to use on the trail. Subman uses a therma rest and has had no issues since starting. We then walked around town and discovered an old fashioned Soda Fountain shop. we got 2 hot dogs with Sauer kraft. and shared a Bannana split. The split even came in a glass dish. We thoroughly enjoyed the shop and the big band music playing in the background. The building was built in 1906 and was a hotel with a bowling alley in it's day. We love exploring things like this in the towns we pass through. We later went down to the Bakery again where they had 3 grills going, making pulled pork BBQ. across the street there was a wine tasting and we bought a chilled bottle of white wine and found a picnic table in a park to enjoy it. We got caught up on our family calls with our children. and enjoyed talking with my parents. We are totally relaxed, have our gear together, and ready to walk into Jersey bright and early in the morning.","Delaware Water Gap Church Hostel

We followed roadway into the Delaware Water Gap Recreation area and began the gradual 2-3 mile climb to the Ridge. There were several weekend day hikers on the trail. New Jersey surprised me. It is beautiful. We shortly came up to a glacieral pond surrounded by blooming Laurel. It was a nice breezy but sunny day! We stopped for an early lunch by the trail and Forest and Hoosier came by. Slack packing for a day. It was nice to see them again. We saw Cheddar go by from the Hostel last night. Stripe was leapfrogging us throughout the day. We mounted several lookout points along the ridge and the valley below was green and lush with a few lakes and rivers. We continued on and had 10 miles done by noon. A few miles more we came to Catfish Fire Tower. Subman climbed it and took a few pictures while I waited below. It was pretty windy on the Ridge with 14 mph winds. We climbed a little more and came upon a large swamp with 2 beaver dams in the water. That was cool to see the Dams and a few trees with the beavers handiwork evident. Our campsite was just ahead and we arrived by 330pm. Subman set up the tent, then began cooking Dinner while I set up the tent.

We went 10 miles then came into Culver's Gap. there were several restaurants listed in AWOLS guide near the trail. as we went west on NJ 206 the first restaurant was closed, Than also the second restaurant was closed. Finally we came to Gyp's Tavern and it was open for lunch. Sub and I both had a burger and onion rings and they were delicious. We sat outside and enjoyed the view of the lake while we ate our lunch. We had new energy after the great food so we took off towards the next shelter. After 3 miles we arrived at the Gren Anderson shelter, where we fill all our water bottles for the evening. If we carry enough water we can pick a nice spot to camp for the night, whenever we see one we like. It was pretty rocky along the trail so we ended up at the next shelter before finding a nice camping site. We had seen Forrest and Hoosier earlier today and they were at the Mashipacong Shelter winding down their day. At the Shelter we met a Ridge Runner named Grasshopper. A really nice guy. He told us a trail Angel named Amy had brought trail magic and it was in the bear box! Thank you Amy, I really enjoyed my pop tart! there are a few section hikers coming in tonight.

We made salami wraps and enjoyed a midmorning snack on the picnic table next to the building. After our break we continued on to a wooden tower that had a view of High Point Monument. This marked the highest point in NJ. We were looking forward to staying at the Unionville park in a few miles so we headed out. Thanks for the heads up Bama about the Murray secret shelter! We stopped there before heading into Unionville. We took an awesome Shower and washed a few clothes at the Murray Property. It was a beautiful farm and very generous of Mr. Murray to share it!

Neither Subman or I slept well last night. In retrospect it would have been a lot more peaceful to stay at the Sherman property and do the less than 1 mile into town in the morning. The trail was very easy as we walked around the perimeter of Wallkill preserve. We climbed Pochuck Mtn. and descended onto a boardwalk that stretched for a couple of miles. We were walking with B-Hiker and ran into Hedgehog and Mamagoose on the trail, Subman was definately outnumbered by the ladies. When we finished the boardwalk we came to NJ 94 and went east to Mitch's Grill and had hot dogs and cold cokes. Walking back to the trail we decided to go to the Heaven Hill Farm for Ice Cream. I had Maine Blueberry and Subman had crunchy cookies and cream and they both were delicious. With food in our bellies we climbed the 1000ft ""stairway to heaven"" called Wawayanda Mtn.

It was 68° so we didn't put our rain gear on, the forest canopy shielded us from most of the rain. The trail was very nice for the first couple miles. We walked over ridge and looked down on Greenwood Lake. AWOL had made a note about today's profile, It said ""Despite the unimposing profile,rocks and abrupt ups and downs make this section challenging. Since when does the guide say watch out for rocks?? Well there were rocks alright, Huge boulders! one rocky ascent had rebar steps, called the Ladder, to climb the rocks. for the next 8 miles we climbed over huge, slippery, wet rocks. Both Subman and I fell more than a few times. One moment of Triumph came when we saw the state line. Subman and I had crossed New Jersey off our list, and entered New York! New York is where Subman grew up so it was a homecoming of sorts. We came to a road crossing and walked 0.2 west to a hot dog stand, where we had cold drinks and Dogs. a little further up the road was a creamery that was hiker friendly. We headed there to refill our water bottles and have a Bannana Split. I can see a pattern developing here...At the creamery it began to rain again and we were tired from the rock scrambles.

New York had a little roller coaster in her trail today. We quickly started going up to Rock scrambles first thing in the morning. they were a lot more fun since it wasn't raining today. Trail Angels in the area had left 4 different Caches of water at the gaps. It really relieved us of carrying a lot of water, since a lot of the sources were unreliable are brackish, the water caches were a Godsend. We continued to regain our climbing legs that we had not used in awhile. We climbed stone steps at Fitzgerald Falls, stopped at Buchanan Mtn for wrap sandwiches around noon and had 8 more miles of climbing to finish our day. We went through the Lemon Squeeze late in the day. We squeezed through the initial tight rocks only to come up to a rock wall to conquer. Forrest and Hoosier were with us and the young whipper Snappers were behind us. After all 4 older hikers made it over the wall, the young ones called us ""Over Achievers"", then proceeded to take the easier blue blaze around it.

We have climbed higher mountains in GA. I'm sure the steepness of the climbs and the heat have something to do with it. After 6 of these 300-500ft climbs we came up to a cracked boulder similar to the Lemon Squeeze in New York. The squeeze was fun and we passed it easily. We are stopping at water sources and drinking a liter and then carrying a liter each. We are trying to stay hydrated but not carry a large amount of water.

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540168,"It rained most of the night and it quit just as it was time for us to have breakfast and pack up. We were on the trail by 645am. We finished the big climb of Mt Prospect that we had avoided last night by stealth camping near the base. Our rested legs see to take us up the climb with ease. After the peak of the mountain, Rands View appeared. Rands view is a beautiful Valley, we spied some stealth hiker tents in the tree line and waved to two socks, get weird and my friend. A little further up is the Giants Thumb, a huge pillar like monolith standing alone at the top of a knoll. We continued on until US 44 were we went the extra half mile into Salisbury, CT. We ate breakfast at a cafe next to LaBonnes the grocery store that we resupplied at. We got 2 days food and 2 12""subs to take out for lunch. On our way out of town we stopped by the Episcopal Church and enjoyed the quiet resting area they provided with a Hiker box and cold drinks. We really enjoyed their hospitality. As we were leaving town we ran into Retainer and talked a while, we had meet him in VA earlier. As we headed up Bear Mountain we also ran into a couple of Section hikers we had seen earlier this week Nick and Mike. At the top of Bear Mountain there is a huge rock observation tower you can easily climb, the view was magnificent. we climbed down the steep stoney backside of the mountain and crossed the CT/MA border. 10 states done, four more to Go! Massachusetts began with beautiful Sages Ravine, a flowing river with many swimming holes. Since it was late in the day and Our clothes would not have time to dry we chose not to partake in their coolness. Only a few short miles and we arrived at Laurel Ridge campsite were we are settled in for the night.","stealth North of Falls village

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540322,"We woke up and had a very relaxed morning, we even had 2 cups of coffee. we were on the trail by 630am. Our hike began with two pretty big ups. The first climb was a 700ft Mt Race, that had breathtaking views along its' Ridgeline. the second climb, was Mt Everett which was the same altitude but much steeper and more rocky than Mt. Race. these two mountains took most of the morning and only gave us six miles to add to our tally. We were fortunate enough to have a trail Angel named Dottie to put out a water cache at the Guilder pond picnic area. We needed this water since all 3 reliable water sources were bone dry. We then hiked the 4 miles of Mt Bushnell with its many ups and downs on its ridgeline. The last few miles to Sheffield, MA were an easy stroll to US 7 where we got picked up by Jessica from Jess Treats Hostel. Jess did everything to make our stay comfortable and provided shuttles to eat and resupply. We definately would recommend a stop here.","Laurel Ridge campsite

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540475,"This morning we enjoyed a Blueberry pancake breakfast at Jess Treat hostel before hitting the trail by 8am. The trail stretched along the Housatonic River until a small climb up June Mountain, Which lead to an even bigger climb of 500ft to East Mountain. On top of the mountain trails split off around rock scrambles somehow I got turned around on one of these roque splits and ended up going southbound. I recognized my mistake almost immediately, but I didn't want Subman to get to far ahead. I blew my whistle, and my knight in shining armour came back to rescue me. It happened so easily but our plan of blowing the whistle worked perfectly. I was always on the AT so I wasn't in any danger, I just wasn't hiking with Subman anymore! After we reconnected, we continued on to the Tom Leonard Shelter to refill our water bottles. the water was a quarter mile straight down a mountain, but it was a good source. Some of the water sources have been unreliable so we were making sure not to run out. We continued on and climbed up to the ledges, which brought us up to a ridge and Mt Wilcox South Shelters. We did not go into the shelters but continued on around a pond. A lot of beaver activity was evident on some fallen trees near the banks of the pond. Looking across the pond there was a beaver dam. We decided to press past our original goal of the Mt Wilcox North Shelter. The predicted rain had held off as we went 4 miles further to the Shaker Campsite. It just started to sprinkle as we were wrapping up dinner so we made it in our tent for the night, dry and happy.","US 7 Sheffield MA

We packed up our wet tent, and we were on the trail by 630am. It was a wonderful cool breezy day in the low 60's. After a pretty level warm up over boardwalks and fields we climbed 300ft to Cobble Hill. After descending Cobble Hill we crossed about three streams on footbridge. In Between one set of footbridge we found the biggest crayfish either of us had ever seen. If it had been closer to lunch I think Subman would have cooked him up! We then had a 900 ft climb up Baldy Mountain that leveled off onto a Ridge. The Ridge had some ups and downs and led us to Upper Goose pond where there is an overnight cabin that you can canoe and swim at. The caretakers of the cabin bring water in and make pancakes for everyone. It was 11am when we came to the intersection of the half mile trail to the cabin. We decided not to go in but to go a little further to Berkshire Lodge at us 20. We could get sodas and order delivered Chinese food there. The Berkshire also had a hiker box, and Subman scored 3 mountain house meals.We returned to the trail with our bellies full and feeling very blessed. We were fueled up to make the 800ft climb up Beckett Mountain. On the summit of Beckett Mountain we ran into the Beer brothers, Larry, Duke, and Mike, who were day hiking. We enjoyed talking about our hike with them. As we went on we descended into a valley with Finery Pond. We had a 2003 photo of this same pond made into a canvas for our home in Georgia. The photo was from Submans 03 Thru hike. I think we have the same shot so it will be fun to compare them when we finish our trip. As we neared October Mountain Shelter we came across an elderly gentleman, named Earl, doing Trail maintenance. Earl was a delight to talk to and we later found out he had been doing maintenance on this section for about 50 years! Wow does MA have there own Bob Peoples?? We went into October Mountain Shelter and called the Cookie Lady who was a little over 2 miles ahead just off the trail. She told us it was OK to Tent on her blueberry farm. We arrived after 6pm and no one was home so we set about setting up camp and making dinner. The Cookie Lady came home and promptly brought us chocolate chip, oatmeal cookies for dessert. She is such a gracious hostess and we returned the favor by watering her plants and Subman will mow some in the morning. The Cookie Ladys' husband Roy is under the weather from a recent fall, so they can use the help. She said he is doing better, but has to wear a brace on his neck. The Cookie Lady is another AT Legend, for years she has been here for hikers. I feel very fortunate to have met her.We thanked her for her hospitality and settled in for the night.","Shaker Campsite

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540651,"We slept well at the Cookie Ladys' farm. We got packed up, then mowed for about an hour before hitting the trail. We said our goodbyes, and sent well wishes to her husband for a quick recovery. The trail continued to be mild like yesterday, but had plenty of roots and rocks to warrant watching your step. Subman and I both felt a little wary after our big mile day yesterday. Just 4 miles in was a 200ft hill and you would have thought it was a 2,000 footer if you had asked us. We stopped at the top and had a rest and salami wraps and it wasn't even 10am yet. a couple of day hikers passed by and we talked a while. As we continued on to Tully Mountain We followed recent clippings on the trail until we encountered A lone Trail Maintainer, named Dean. We thanked him for all his hard work and willingness to spend his holiday weekend on the trail for the likes of us. As we passed the Kay Wood Shelter, we stopped for a candy bar break trying to get a little more energy. We continued on and knocked out the last 300ft climb and descended into the town of Dalton, MA. The trail goes through the town and our first stop was the Ice Cream Man. He was not home but left jelly beans, boiled eggs,cold drinks, and cookies for hikers, we signed the log and wrote a thank you, and continued into town. We stopped at Angelina's for Lunch and Bond joined us. We had been leap frogging him for the last couple of days.We decided we would stay at the Shamrock Village Inn just around the corner. We did our Laundry, took Showers, and relaxed for the rest of the evening. We plan to resupply at Cumberland Farms in the morning when we get our breakfast and head out.","Cookie Lady, Beckett, MA

Subman had Gone to the Cumberland Farms Market to get us breakfast and resupply for the next 2 days. We left the town of Dalton, MA and began climbing Crystal Mountain. On our way down we saw the views from the Hoosic River Valley from the Cobbles, they were breathtaking. We shortly came down into the town of Cheshire, MA. We talked to a few people riding the bike path and as we were talking the local ice cream joint, Diane's Twist opened up. We stopped for Hot Dogs and Ice cream. While sitting at the picnic tables a few people asked us about our hike, after about an hour we pressed on to climbing up towards Mt Greylock. We planned to stop at Mark Noepel Shelter than summit Mt. Greylock tomorrow. after pretty much climbing the rest of the day we arrived at the Shelter at 230pm. one of the earliest arrival times for us. we took advantage of the time by talking and relaxing, after all it is a holiday!

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541051,"We woke up to rain this morning, after looking at the radar, we waited an hour for it to stop. We packed up and hit the trail by 730am. We climbed up to the summit of Mt. Greylock and had breakfast at Bascom Lodge. The summit was foggy and the veterans monument was covered with scaffolding, so it was closed. After breakfast we continued on the trail and came across Thunderbolt Shelter, it is an emergency use only shelter, But more than one hiker has been known to stealth camp there. We continued on the downhill to North Adams and just before we hit town Subman sees a bear headed NOBO on the trail, he scurried off the trail when Subman called out to me, then he turned around and watched us. We shouted and banged our trekking poles and he would move on a little, then turned around again to watch us. he was finally away from the trail enough for us to continue on. We went into North Adams to the stop-n-shop for resupply and lunch. We ate our Roast Beef Sub and salad on a bench near the entrance to the store. We were fueled up and ready to climb out of North Adams. Our plan was to go to the Sherman Brook Campsite just 2.5 miles out of North Adams. Once we reached the campsite, both of us felt strong enough to continue climbing up the 700ft mountain to reach the Vermont state line. Massachusetts wasn't going to let us leave her without one last steep boulder climb. We were sweating so hard our elbows were dripping. It was work, but also fun, we were very satisfied at feeling how strong we were. When we crossed the MA/VT state line, the AT is joined by the start of the Long Trail. Subman thru hiked the Long Trail in 2012. This was double pleasure as He reminisced about both thru-hike adventures. We had about 3 more miles to go before we ended our day at the Seth Warner Shelter. It was almost 7pm, a little late for us to be getting done, but we hurried and set up camp, got water, and made dinner. we were snuggled in our tent by 830pm.","Mark Noepel Shelter

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541113,"We were on the trail by 645am this morning, and doing a 1000ft climb right out of the box. Before you know it we were soaked with sweat, even in the early morning cooler temps. We passed a boggy pond that had a beaver dam We always look closely at areas like this, now that we are in moose territory. After summiting Consultation Peak, we work our way down to Cogdon Shelter. We had an early lunch and took a break, Trooper and 2 socks strolled in, as well as Popper who was slacking going SOBO. Trooper and 2 socks had Halloween costumes strapped to their packs, They planned to celebrate every holiday of the year while on the trail and tomorrow was trailoween. How creative these young minds are! We were the last to leave and we headed out of the shelter. About 2 weeks ago Two Peas' hike ended when moonbeam broke her femur just north of this shelter. When we got close to the spot we took a moment to say a prayer for their recovery, both mentally and physically since leaving the trail so abruptly. We are very cognizant of the fact that ""except for the grace of God there go I"" . We think of them often We finally caught up to them, but it wasn't the happy reunion we thought it would be. They have a journal on trail journals if you would like to send them well wishes, it is under two peas. We planned to go into Bennington, VT to resupply but we needed to make a steep rocky descent to Route 9. When we got to the trailhead there was no cell signal, so we were stuck hitching the 8 miles into town. A nice lady from PA picked us up and took us to the walmart. Unbeknownst to us this walmart was getting ready to move on August 23rd, so their inventory was very limited. We completed our resupply at Price Chopper next door. We then went towards old town to find the Wendy's listed on the map in the A.T.Guide, no Wendy's but there was a McDonald's further down the road. We had noted a phone number from the Cogdon Shelter log of the Caretaker Bob, who could possibly help with town resupply. We called him, and he gave us a ride back to the trailhead. The ride was greatly appreciated! Our packs were heavy with 3 days food and again we were climbing a 1000ft to the shelter. The climb was only 1.6 miles, but it seemed forever. We made it to the Melville Nauhelm Shelter around 6pm. set up camp and went to bed. This town day took a lot out of us, the struggle is real.","Seth Warner shelter

We had a long uphill incline all morning, until we reached Goddard Shelter in 8 miles. There were a group of young men there playing the guitar and singing. Apparently there is a guitar left there for the hikers enjoyment. This morning Ashton was serenading us while we ate wraps for lunch. Right behind the Shelter a little ways uphill on Glastonbury Mt., there is a fire tower that you can climb with fantastic views. The next Shelter was a mere 5 miles of relatively easy up and down trail. The Kid Gore Shelter had about 12 people, resting for lunch, or getting water, we were having a snack then pushing on to the next shelter. Just as we left the Shelter a rain shower started and it actually felt good. It had been so humid all day, it was a welcome change in weather.

The flies were so bad, only one person stayed in the shelter, and he had a ninja buff wrap on his head. This morning we were not the first to leave, a group of 4 section hikers passed through camp and on their way out left 2 oranges on the picnic table. Score! I shared one with another Long Trail hiker, and put the other one next to ""Bond"" who was sleeping in the shelter. We were the next to leave, and on the trail by 630am. 
Today we had Stratton Mountain to climb, it was a 1700ft climb to the summit. This is the mountain Benton Mackay was inspired to propose the AT on. There is a caretakers cabin on top, along with a fire tower. Today the view was foggy and the Caretaker Jean was there with lively conversation about the area. We ended the long descent of Stratton Mt. at the Stratton Pond Shelter. This Shelter is a pay shelter if you spend the night it is 5 dollars. The pay shelters are known to have nicer privys since there is a caretaker there. On the way out I stopped to use the privy, what a nightmare. I went inside and the door closed behind me, I opened the lid and it was filled to the top. I quickly closed the lid, as black flies swarmed all around me. I tried to make a fast escape and the outside latch had locked me inside. I screamed for Subman, ""get me outta here, I'm locked in!"", here comes my knight in shining armour to save me again. That was awful, I was so glad Sub was there. We looked around for a caretaker and could find no one. Maybe he quit and forgot to tell someone. We pushed on to a fairly level part of trail, after about 6 miles we came to Prospect Rock. Prospect Rock had a fantastic view of Manchester below. We rested there a bit, and called for a reservation at the Green Mountain House Hostel for tomorrow night. We had gotten our water for the night so we went on to look for a camp site. We didn't find anything before coming to the last shelter before town. We stopped at the Spruce Peak Shelter and managed to find a small spot for our tent.

This in itself was fine, except he was singing Christmas carols also, I mean really??? So I'm opening one eye at a time trying to wake up to the fact we are packing up in the rain, Submans coffee helps. We get packed up and the rain stops in time for us to hike the few short miles into town. Get Weird and My Friend are on the shelter porch getting ready to head out also. We are out on the trail first, and soon they pass us, reaching the road to town a few minutes before Subman and I. We hang back so they can hitch a ride, and they called out to us that there was room for 4. town day was going great so far! Loren, The young man who picked us up often gives hikers a ride into town since he passes the trail head on the way home from work. Thank you Loren, you are a great Trail Angel. Our first stop was food, we went to Mrs. Murphys Donuts. There was a very nice, older lady working and she was being flooded by customers since there was a horse show in town. More than a few moments passed before we got to order our breakfast sandwiches, but they soon came and we enjoyed them with fresh donuts and coffee. On to the Price Chopper for resupply. along with our 3 days of food, Subman got 2 steaks and potatoes to fix for dinner tonight. We had made reservations at Green Mountain House and they have a fully stocked hiker kitchen to use. We found a corner in the Plaza to repackage our food, and dispose of all the packaging waste. This helps us eliminate a lot of pack out trash. By this time EMS Outfitters were open and we got new Super feet insoles for me, and more 98% Deet (which we proved works when I locked myself in the privy with the horde of black flies). Now we had most of our errands done, but we had a couple of hours before check in time at Green Mountain House. We went to McDonald's and found a table with a wall outlet to charge our phones. After eating a burger, Subman walked over to Mountain Goat Outfitters to get Aqua Mira that EMS didn't have. While he was gone I called my Mom and checked In. When Sub returned we began trouble shooting the SPOT GPS, It had stop working last night. After calling Customer Service they will be sending a replacement up the trail for us. So for all those following us on the spot it will be down for the next 4-5 days, but we will be hiking. Jeff, the owner of Green Mountain House picked us up at 1pm and we were the first quests to arrive at the hostel. After a quick tour the whole house was ours. This place has everything, the cleanest showers on the trail, free laundry, guitar and keyboard for talented hikers, computer, cable TV, and a fully stocked kitchen to cook your food. What more could you ask for. This place is great! We took our showers and Subman grilled our steaks for a delicious dinner. Later This evening we got an even bigger surprise, Rabbit texted us and said He and Beth would be by to see us!!!
It was so wonderful to meet Beth (she is just as awesome as Rabbit said) and to see Rabbit again. We had not seen his hairy face since Gatlinburg, and there was much more hair now. He looked fantastic after his bout with Lymes disease and putting on a few needed pounds. Beth has done a great job of nursing him back to health and keeping him on the trail.

The Green Mountain House was hard to leave, we were so comfortable. We were on the trail by 8am and it was raining pretty hard. The trail was a river with huge muddy lakes pooled in places. We immediately started climbing to reach the warming hut on the summit of Bromley mountain. Towards the end of our climb we were crossing grassy channels that were ski slopes in the winter, but today they were dripping wet grasses reaching out to soak us. We went into the warming hut and ate our boiled eggs and chips for a snack. It was nice and toasty in the warming hut, but we continued on hiking in the cold rain to our next summit, Styles peak. We climbed a 1000ft steep rocky ascent to Styles and than crossed a ridge to Peru Peak. We climbed down for a mile to Peru Peak Shelter and it was after 1pm, so we had wraps and chips for lunch. we had less than 5 miles to do until we finished our day at Lost Pond Shelter. Sounded easy but I didn't know about Bakers Peak. It was quite the climb, with slabs of rock that pointed straight up and slippery from the rain. Both Subman and I rose to the challenge and made it to the top. It was then 2 miles downhill to the shelter for the night. As soon as we got to the shelter, Subman put up the tent and I got water from the stream down the hill. Sub than fixed Dinner while I set up our things inside the tent.

We packed up our still wet tent, after putting on our still wet clothes. We hit the trail around 645am hoping we would dry out with todays nice weather that was predicted. It was a nice breezy day, that was even a little chilly since we were wet. We kept moving to stay warm. The first 5 miles would have been an easy walk but it turned into a rock hopping challenge to avoid the running water and mud that was the trail today. We stopped at Little Rock Pond Shelter for an early lunch of wraps and chips. Little Rock Pond was beautiful, with the sun coming up on the pond with cloudless blue skies. We continued down the trail that was flowing just like a stream, our feet soaked. When we crested the White Rocks Cliffs, there was a garden of cairns. It was whimsical to see all the different shapes and sizes in the pine forest. We passed a beautiful waterfall that was roaring, swollen with the recent rains. At the top of the falls we had to ford the river and we didn't even put our crocs on, our shoes and socks were already soaked. We soon came to our biggest climb for today, Bear Mountain. This Mountain was a 1100ft climb on pretty nice trail. There were switchbacks towards the top, something we haven't seen in a while. It was nice trail and we both climbed strong. A climb at the end of the day is always hard. We descended into a hollow and we were shortly at the Minerva Hinchey Shelter. We were in camp early, around 3pm. With a little sunshine still left we hung a line for wet socks and coats. There was a nice piped spring with crystal clear water. Camp was set up and Subman made an early dinner.

We came to a rock outcroppings that was home to a solitary chair that you could sit and watch the Rutledge airport in the valley below. The chair had been there for a while because, Subman remembered it from 2012 when he thru hiked the Long Trail. We continued on down into a gorge with a roaring river and crossed it on a suspension bridge that swayed with every movement you made walking across. This brought us up to VT 103 where we walked a half mile west off the trail to the Whistlestop restaurant. It was 8am but the owner said we could have burgers if we wanted them, so that is what we ordered. The owner was so kind and accommodating, even though the place was packed. She let us charge our phones, and moved some of the regulars around to make room at a table for us.It was delicious and we enjoyed our meal. We headed the half mile back to the trail, fueled up for our next 500ft climb with a rock scramble on top. For the rest of today we would be leap frogging Crazy Legs, Soup, 2 guys hiking the Long Trail, and Shaggy. We were passing each other so often we started a friendly game of tag. We were all a little excited, anticipating the first really big climb up since before VA. Mt Killington was a 2600ft climb over 4 miles. right at the base of the mountain we passed a sign that said we only had 500 miles to Katahdin. It was a great morale booster. As we continue on to the Governor Clement Shelter, The trail is nice but an occasional muddy area comes up. In one area there was a huge muddy area spanning across the trail. As I climbed the higher bank to go around it I lost my balance and my pack pulled me back, turtle up into the mud hole! I was covered from head to toe in Vermud! I screamed going in and Subman came running back. There I stood covered in mud. After he found out I was OK, the laughter came. Luckily I was near a pretty good sized river and I got in clothes and all to rinse off. We then had a quick lunch at the shelter before continuing our climb of Mt. Killington. It was a beautiful climb and we had views of several mountain ranges, as far as the eyes could see. It was exciting since we hadn't seen views like this, since we were down south. Mt. Killington is also a ski resort and we spied the lodge restaurant and gondola on a nearby peak. We made it to the Cooper Lodge Shelter on the summit and set up camp for the night.

We completed the almost 6 miles down Mt. Killington to RT 4. 0.8 miles to the East was the Inn at Long Trail and Subman had been talking about staying here since Georgia. We made it to the Inn at 930am just in time to get breakfast before the dining room closed. The staff here are awesome and provide great customer service. We got our room and started our laundry, making a list of town chores as we got our showers. We went to the Pub downstairs and had nachos, Murray the owner told us how to catch the bus to Rutland to go to the outfitters and walmart. We made it into and out of town quickly, Mountain traveler Outfitters had Submans Super Feet and then the owner gave us a ride to the walmart, where we quickly resupplied everything but deli items. This walmart is one of the limited ones. We got our cheese and Salami at a neighboring Price Chopper. We returned via bus to the Inn with everything on our list. After repackaging everything we went to the Pub for dinner. When we walked in there was a very welcomed smiling face, Purple was here! We had not seen her since Glasgow, VA. There was a few other familar faces, Retainer, and Bombadil who I had read on trailjournals.com but had not met til now. I had been talking with a classmate from Bellville Ohio and Lorri Hoeflich came to visit me here! It was so great to walk down memory lane with her.

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542055,"After a recent questbook signing I got to thinking about what I write in our journal every day. Like Subman and I, other hikers read each other's journal to see what the trail is like, where they camped, and to see where our friends are etc. I post the time we start and finish because it gives the reader some idea of the temputure and lighting of the trail, or in my case how groggy I am, I am not a morning person,LOL. I talk about food, well because We are hungry ALL the time, the average hiker burns 6,000-8,000 calories a day. I can eat everything in sight and I have lost 40lbs! Hiker Stench, well we know we stink after 3-5 days in the woods, we joke about it because we are self conscious and all you can do is laugh and wash up in a nearby stream as best you can. The pooping in the woods thing, if you gotta do it you might as well have a view, and there is none better than out here. So as you see while on this journey I have let all my social defenses fall away which opens me to deeper, quicker relationships than I would not normally allow, It has restored my faith in Humanity. There are wonderful, great people in the world with hearts of gold! I have learned to trust others, which was a huge obstacle in my life. My Spirituality has grown immensely, you get a lot of time to talk to God. The World is his masterpiece. I have seen places on earth that take my breath away and bring tears to my eyes. I have made a lot of analogies about life and the trail, and how We hike. We pass every blaze because I like to do my best, and I get a sense of pride from a job well done. My parents always said if your going to do it, do it right. That is MY hike, someone else may have the desire to experience the trail in a different way, such as yellow blazing, Or slack packing. I chose to carry my full pack every step of the way. I have everything I NEED on my back. You have heard the saying, Hike Your Own Hike. It is true on the trail you HYOH and there is no judge. the only one watching is you. We are enjoying our hike immensely and we are so blessed to have been able to line things up in order to go. The support of our families, even though at times they didn't understand it has given us mental fortitude. Thank you for listening and coming along on our journey. Enjoy the laughter, the tears, the pain, and the love, the trail provides.","Inn at the Long Trail

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542252,"We were a little late getting on the trail today. The Inn at The Long Trail serves an awesome breakfast with your room so we waited til 730am to have breakfast. We were on the trail at 830am. Within 2 miles we passed the Maine junction where the Long Trail leaves the AT. With that split of the two trails we should see less hikers. 4 more miles, after passing through Gifford Woods State Park, we took the short side trail to Thundering Falls. The falls were beautiful and The AT followed the beautiful boardwalk to a road that lead us to a 1300ft climb of Quimby Mountain. That was our highest climb today. We crossed a few rollers then the steep downhill into Stoney Brook Shelter. We had a wrap for lunch and talked to Soup, Bombadil, Lady Slipper, Water Tank, And Wishing Bone. We leaped frogged each other for the next 8 miles. Just out of the Shelter there was an awesome water source, clear as glass and it had several pools that were filled by mini waterfalls. I could not get over how clear the water was. We saw Retainer getting his water there, we said hello and pushed on. At around 15 miles we filled all our water bottles and carried it to a lookout tower and private cabin. The owners let hikers sleep in the cabin and enjoy the awesome view. Subman and I found a great tent spot just below the cabin. We ate our dinner on the porch of the cabin and socialized with a few hikers who stopped by to have their dinner. Cruz Missile, Wishing Bone, Soup, Junco, and Retainer were there. after returning to our tent Romani, who we hadn't seen since Green Mountain House, strolled in. It was great to see everyone. It is a nice evening around 70° as the sun is going down.","Inn at the Long trail

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542416,"This morning Subman climbed the tower on top of the cabin and saw a beautiful sunrise. Romani. Cowboy camped in the Tower last night, what a brave soul. After we were packed up we were on the trail by 630am. The trail was very hiker friendly for the first 2 miles, pretty flat and clear of roots and rocks. We did a quick uphill to the intersection of Wintturri Shelter where several hikers were spilling out onto the trail. We ran into a small bubble ofabout 10 southbounders who were freshly starting their journeys. It was nice to glean helpful info of the trail forward. The next 2 miles was a steep downhill to VT 12. Then the fun started for the next 6 miles there were five 500-700ft climbs one right after the other. It was hot and hard. We found ourselves at Cloudland Rd after a steep downhill. we went 0.2 off the trail to the west to Cloudland farms Market. Subman and I shared a pint of vanilla ice cream while enjoying the view of the valley below. Today had been a tough one for my feet, just two miles into our day my Plantar Facitis became very painful. About every hour I was rolling my foot on my golf ball. I am very thankful to Barnyard for bringing it to me in Harper's Ferry, it has been a hike saver! We went another 2.3 miles to Thistle Hill Shelter.

I started off with my frog togg jacket and zpak rain Kilt only to remove them within a half hour of hiking. We were pretty excited about today not having so many high ups and quickly made time. Within 5 miles we cruised our way to the infamous bridge crossing the White River. This bridge is about 20'high and is famous for people jumping off of it into the river below. I didn't do it, but I know someone who did....Romani jumped and has the video to prove it! Subman and I chose to quietly cross the bridge and stop at the Hart residence, where we were offered coffee and eggs for breakfast. Robert and Linda Hart have been offering trail magic from their home for over 20 years! the great breakfast fueled us up for the huge 1000ft climb up to Happy Hill Shelter. I washed up in the brook before the shelter and Subman got us water. We had snacks at the shelter then pushed on, in about 4 miles we would be in Norwich VT and the store there had a deli. When we reached Elm St. there was a car at the trailhead. A small voice came from the Drivers window saying ""I thought you might cross here today"". When we came around to the window a lady with a flowery hat was sitting there. We didnt know who it was but soon learned it was Hat Lady. Hat Lady had been following us in our journal along with a few others, Her pastor Sooner or Later, and Bombadil. She gave us some trail magic and we continued down Elm St. We made it to the general store by 2pm. grabbed a sandwich and soda for lunch. We resupplied and sat on the outside bench to eat. Retainer, Junco, and Romani came into the general store. They told us they had met Hat Lady and she was meeting them at 5pm to take them to a hotel 2 miles out of Hanover. We decided we would do the same if she had room for getting us also. So we crossed over the VT/NH State line, just 2 more states to go!(picture in gallery). After getting to Hanover We went to the outfitter. Subman's shorts had been wearing away so he finally resigned himself to the fact the red shorts probably weren't going to make it the whole way. Subman is now sporting new Tan shorts. I hope I don't get lost, not having the red shorts to follow. By this time it was time to meet Hat Lady. She was so awesome and took us to the hotel, EMS Outfitters, and CVS, She was also kind enough to join us for Dinner at Molly's. We enjoyed the great conversation and before we knew it, it was past hiker midnight. Hat Lady returned us to our hotel and we said our Goodbyes.

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542752,"We packed up and headed to the bus stop just a short ways from the hotel. Hanover has a free bus M-F, so we caught the 725am back to the corner in town where Hat Lady picked us up. Lous' is just up from the corner so we stopped in for breakfast and our free donut. the breakfast was great but a little pricey. We continued to weave our way through Hanover and turned into the woods after passing the college soccer fields. After 2 miles we came to a steep 300ft climb, but soon we were back to nice trail with rolling hills and boardwalks over bogs. 10 miles out we climbed the 900ft south peak of Moose Mountain. We past an 8yr old little girl called Red Cap. She was pretty awesome. Red Cap was climbing the mountain with her pack, poles and the biggest smile on her face. I see a future Thru hiker. When we got to Moose Mountain Shelter, there was another Dad with his 2 daughters 8 & 10 years old. they also had their own packs and were out for 2 weeks if hiking. We ducked into the shelter around 2pm and ate lunch while trying to avoid a thunderstorm.after 3pm only a few raindrops had fallen so we decided to press our luck and push on. The sky turned blue and it was smooth sailing for the next couple of miles. We ran into Gentle Ben, and Water Tank was shortly behind us. We all were going to the Trapper John Shelter. To get to the shelter we first had to climb a 1000ft climb to Holts Ledge. The climb was so steep you were on your toe tips most of the time. At the top the view was awesome. you could see nearby Cliffs and several mountain ridges. We also met a hiker from Beijing named Clockwork taking in the view. we made it to the Shelter and set up camp as thunder rolled in the distance. after we settled in our tents we heard a tree fall nearby, off in the woods. there are a lot of fallen Birch trees, I don't think they are very strong. I also got a text from Moonbeam. She shared this wonderful you tube link with us. Hope you enjoy it we did!","Hanover, NH

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542894,"We dodged all the thunderstorms last night and packed up dry and on the trail by 650am. We finished the downhill from Holts Ledge and crossed Grafton Turnpike. We wove through tall grass until we came to where Bill Ackerly's home is 0.1 off the trail. There was an obituary posted that he had passed away last year. Bill had welcomed Hikers at his home for many years, sharing stories, croquet games, and ice cream. It was sad to hear of another trail legend gone. we continued on for 2 more miles then started our big climb for the day. Smart Mountain was a 2100ft climb that had a quartzite ridge nestled in the middle of the climb. This ridge had some spectacular views. As we continued on up to the summit there were many rock steps and at one point rebar steps to climb over a big rock slab. It was not an easy climb, but the weather was great, cool and dry until we got to the top. The Mountain had grabbed a cloud and it was downright cold. When we stopped at the shelter we put our coats on and I even put my gloves on because my fingers were getting numb. Sub said this was a good example of how the weather changes in the Whites. We finished our lunch and began the 4 mile descent of Smart Mtn. About halfway down Sub slipped off a Bog plank and sunk in mud up to his knee. His biggest challenge was not losing his shoe as he pulled his leg out. I have to give myself credit, I did not laugh as hard as Sub did when I had fallen in the soupy mud of Vermont. At the bottom of our descent there was a beautiful brook and Sub washed up as I soaked my feet in the cool water. We crossed the bridge and started our climb up Mt Cube. After 1.5 miles into the climb we came to Hexacuba Shelter. We climbed uphill for another 0.3 miles to reach the hexagonal shaped shelter. Water Tank was there already, sleeping in the shelter. Subman and I set up our camp and I quickly snuggled into my down jacket and sleeping bag, dozing before Sub had made dinner. We are settled in our tent for the night and enjoying the wonderful cool breeze, perfect sleeping weather.","Trapper John Shelter

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542955,"We were up early and well rested. We were on the trail by 6am. Right off the bat we climbed the remaining 1000ft climb of Mt. Cube. A few rock scrambles later we were enjoying a most magnificent view! We did a 3 miles descent from Mt. Cube and got water and ate a nice mid morning snack of Salami and Cheese at the gap. We then were fueled up for our next climb over 3 miles to Ore Hill. This section was hit hard by the thunderstorms 2 days ago and there were plenty of blow downs on the trail. It was also plenty muddy from the torrential rains. In spite of this we were still making pretty good time and had 10 miles in before noon, even with all the climbing. We finished off the salami and cheese before our last leg of todays hike. We had a small 700ft climb of Mt. Mist then a nice descent into Glencliff to the Welcome Hiker Hostel, owned by Packrat. Subman stayed here before going into the Whites in 2003. The Hostel is full tonight. We have caught up with some old hiker friends, Old Fox, Mustard Seed, Hooshr and Forrest, and Retainer. It is great to see them again. I stayed to do Laundry while Subman resupplied at the convenience store a few miles away. We are excited to get a good nights rest before going up Mt.

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543152,"We got up early and got on the trail by 630am. Today we begin the White Mountains, starting with Mt. Moosilauke. We beat all the whipersnappers out of the hostel. A lot of hikers planned to slack pack back to the hostel tonight. Our plan was to go over Moosilauke and onto Eliza Brook Shelter. We made it up to the summit by 1030. pretty good time considering it was a 3500ft climb over rocks and very steep. when we got to tree line, right on the trail was a female moose! Subman manage to get past her and then she followed him up the trail until there was a place for her to get off the trail. There were about 8 hikers there that appreciate Subs efforts to clear the trail. it was funny because as we were coming down from the summit. the southbounders were calling Sub the Moose Whisperer. The descent of Moosilauke was a whole new ballgame! There were lots of rocks and it was steep. It was so beautiful with the water cascading along side the trail. At times there were railroad tie steps embedded into rock slabs with rebar handholds to aid in getting down, otherwise it was near impossible. Subman and I stopped by the falls and ate a turkey wrap that Sub bought at the Deli last night. Can't beat that for restaurant ambiance. We finally made it to the bottom at Kinsman Notch. We made the steep 700ft climb up to Kinsman Ridge, it was very rocky with some huge steps. When we got to the top the fun started. What looked like ok trail in AWOLS Guide, turned out to be the hardest trail we didn't expect. It was rock climbing, rockhopping and root dodging at its best. It took us 5.5
hours to do seven miles. We arrived at Eliza Shelter around 630pm, exhausted but very satisfied that we completed a day that only a few twenty somethings had done that day. Not bad for a couple of old hikers. As a side note our Spot unit has been replaced and is working now for those following it. Good to have in the whites. There are also extra pics in the photo gallery from today. It is hard to choose just one.","Welcome Hiker Hostel, Glencliff

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543153,"We got up really early today. We wanted to get to Franconia Notch before the thunderstorms were forcast to start. We were on the trail by 520am using my headlamp to make sure I didn't trip on roots. I was still tired from the previous day of hiking and it was going to be another tough one today. Immediately we started going up an over 2000ft climb to Mt. Kinsman. Halfway up the climb we pass beautiful Harrington Pond. The boardwalk provided little protection from the swampy grasslands surrounding the pond. Most of the boards were covered with water and mud. We continued on to the top of Mt. Kinsmans South Summit. A lot of hand over hand rock climbing on a very steep ascent. The views were spectacular, we could see the mountains that are in our future, a little intimidating yet exciting. The South peak had a cairn at the summit that had a chair built into the stones. Subman took the opportunity to check a cell signal. He had been talking to Joe, a fellow Bubble head, who has been reading our journal. Joe was kind enough to help us get into town while he is hiking in the Whites this week. Seems like the most awesome Trail Angels show up just when you need them. After Sub sent his texts we started down the steep descent of the South peak crossing a mile Ridge to the North peak. This peak was tree covered and slightly lower than the south. We began our descent down. Thankfully it was easier then coming up, even though it was still slow going. Halfway down we arrive at the Kinsman Pond Shelter. There was a group of about 9 Ladies there. These ladies were performing trail maintenence and building for the AMC. They were carrying their tools back down the trail and looking to drop any weight from their packs. Nothing like 2 hungry thru hikers there to help as they gave us food left over from their trip. It was 930am so we ate a second breakfast. We leapfrog the group of ladies until we got to the Lonesome Lake Hut. We went inside and got a cold drink of lemonade and a piece of coffee cake. After making a Hotel reservation in North Woodstock, we continued the 3 more miles to Franconia Notch. Joe and his daughter picked us up and gave us a quick run down of the area and took us to the hotel. We got a quick bite to eat, showered, and did laundry.

As it turns out a zero in town was a good move. When we looked at Subs big toe that had been bothering him it was very infected so he is soaking it in Epsom Salt after relieving the pressure from around the nail bed.

We really appreciate his kindness. We were back on the trail by 715am. Immediately we begin to climb to Little Haystack mountain, at 4800ft it brings us to the start of the Presidentials. The trail was wet from the recent rains, but well maintained. Sub and I both commented on how nice it was to have good trail after our experience on Kinsman Ridge. At the top of Little haystack we began to go above treeline. the views were Spectacular! We were above the clouds. climbing to 5089ft we summitted Mt. Lincoln, There were several people there. It was Sunday and we were coming up to the area of Greenleaf Hut. The huts are primative lodges owned by AMC. People hike into them, and for 120.00 a night they get a bunk with breakfast and a dinner. At that rate it would be quite costly for the two of us to reserve spots at these huts. We will try to work for stay at the huts we are near at the end of our day. Our day was still young and from Mt Lincoln you could see Mt Lafayette. Large Cairns marked the trail to the summit of Lafayette and as we walked I kept stopping to take in the views. Mountains went on forever, as Snow white clouds danced between them. you could see Mt. Washington, the highest of the Presidentials, in the distance. We summitted Mt Lafayette and quickly left most of the crowd behind us as we continued north on The AT. We were crossing Franconia Ridge. It was beautiful, and the wind was quite gusty. It was chilly but a clear sky let the sun warm the air so we were comfortable. We went back below treeline and it broke the wind. Now we concentrated on the steep descent. The trail was rocky at times and slippery from the rain. At some of the hard spots, I scooted down on my butt and hung onto tree roots. We passed Garfield pond and began climbing our last mountain for the day Mt Garfield it was very steep and a 600ft climb. At the summit Sub and I took a break, We snacked on some chips and Chicken fingers we had packed out from town. There were about 10 hikers at the summit, as Sub and I listened to their plans, most were going to Gale head Hut 3 miles north. We knew then our chances of work for stay were slim, The younger hikers were much faster than me and the steep rocky terrain made me even slower, going down Mt. Garfield. At one point we were climbing down the middle of a waterfall! We arrived at the Hut around 4pm and we're offered left overs with about 6 other hikers. Subman inquired about work for stay. The Croo boss said there was no work for stay but told us about a stealth camp site just a quarter mile North. This would work even better for us. We didn't have to stay and work after breakfast if we stayed at the stealth site. Camping meant we could get up early, and get on the trail. We saw that rain was predicted for the afternoon tomorrow, we could try to get to Crawford Notch before it hit. We were the first hikers at the stealth site, so we picked the driest site and set up camp. We were snuggled in our tent and soon heard other hikers coming in. Water Tank, Old Fox and others we had seen at the hostel in Glencliff. It was nice to see familar faces and to know our friends had faired well during the recent storms.","North Woodstock

After the rock climb we summitted the Mt. and began the rocky steep descent. There were a few breaks in the trail that were flat and clear. In 7 miles we had made the 2500ft descent to Zealand Falls Hut. We enjoyed mushroom soup and sandwiches for dinner. After our break we left the Hut and found the trail very nice along the Ethan Pond trail for 4 miles. We made the 1500ft descent into Crawford Notch. We stayed at the Crawford Notch Campground, which had coin laundry, and showers. There also was a general store. The store was pretty pricey, but had what you needed to resupply.

Webster which had a spectacular view of all the mountains and clouds. After 6 miles of climbing we reach Mizpah Hut. We saw Forrest and Hooshr, along with water tank and a few others we have been hiking with the past few days. We only took a short break and started off for the Lake of the Clouds Hut. We were hoping to get work for stay. The Trail was above treeline and it got pretty windy. We were walking in the clouds so it was a little wet, and at times the rain stung our faces. We followed the Cairns until we saw the outline of the Hut in the fog. It was only 11 miles today but it was 4pm when we were done. The Whites are slow going.

We climbed 1000ft in a mile and summitted Mt. Washington. We stood in front of the Web Cam on the observation deck and waved our hiking poles. We saw the Cog Railway approaching, Subman wanted to follow AT tradition and moon the train. but he has no moon left, lol. We went into the visitors center for a rest and waited for the snack bar to open. while waiting I went through the museum. I was intrigued by the journal entry shown when the fastest wind speed on earth was recorded. If I remember correctly it was 231mph. We got a few things for our resupply and enjoyed some nachos and cold drinks. We were ready to tackle the three remaining peaks for today, Mt. Jefferson, Edmunds Col, and Mt. Madison. All of these mountains were above treeline and over 5000ft tall. Trail was very rocky as we boulder hopped our way to Madison Spring Hut nestled between Edmands Col,and Mt. Madison. When we reached the Hut we only had hiked 7 miles. The rocks were killing my feet and next was the largest of the three peaks, Madison was straight up with a 3000ft steep descent.

We crossed NH 16 and started up the Wildcats. A 2000ft climb up a rocky crevasse with stone stairs. It was hot and humid and sweaty work. At one point my crocs had fallen off my pack during a pretty technical climb, I had resigned myself to losing them, then Subman dropped his pack and went down to retrieve them. This man is amazing. Subman has been drawing hearts in the trail since we started in Georgia. One of his first hearts was etched in snow! I often find them in the trail where he has waited for me to catch up. Today's picture is a heart I found for him on our trail this morning. We made it up to the second Wildcat peak and there was a ski gondolas for people to ride up. Some hikers will ride up and slackpack South to miss the big climb, then ride the gondola up the next day and slackpack north to complete the 21miles between notches. We continued on to cross two more Wildcat peaks and descended down 1100ft to Carter Notch Hut, the last Hut in the White Mtns.

We had tortilla wraps and fresh Blueberries, from the Summit,for lunch while enjoying the view. We meet a fellow NOBO hiker named Fresh Breath, and he told us Forrest, Hooshr, and Old Fox were behind us. So the AARP group was pretty close together. We continued on past dream lake still no moose. Within 2 miles we came to the Gentian Pond Shelter. It was 2pm and the water source was from the pond and not very good. As we were deciding whether or not to stay we spot a moose running through a swampy field! After the excitement of the Moose dies down we decide to press on. The trail after the Shelter was rocky and steep and a 1000ft climb of Mt Success. We were tired and this was Rabbits 1st day back, If I was tired I know he was. After the steep decline of Mt Success we crossed the NH/ME state line at 530pm! what an exciting moment! A few tears a lot of smiles. Then we continued on the half mile to the Carlo Col Shelter. This last half mile was a steep rock climbing descent. Welcome to Maine.","Gorham, NH

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544352,"We were on the trail by 620am. We rested so well after the long day yesterday. Rabbit was the first to leave then Sub and I was next shortly after him. We climbed the very rocky, uphill, shelter trail to reach the white blazes. Then immediately a steep 300ft ascent of Mt. Carlo. We then climbed up to the West and East peaks of Goose Eye Mtn, then crossing a ridge to the North peak. Within 5 miles we arrived at Full Goose Shelter and ate an early morning wrap. We were coming 1000ft down Fulling Mill Mtn. and there were 5 AMC trail workers carrying packs up the mountain. These packs were incredibly big with maintenance tools and items used to set up camp, one even had a generator! 3 of the 5 carrying packs were women. They have my respect carrying those packs, and they were putting in some pretty nice trail too! At the end of the descent of Fulling Mill Mtn.we were getting ready to go into the hardest (or most fun) mile of the AT, Mahoosuc Notch. This was a mile of jumbled boulder pits that you weave your way over and under to get through. I had to take my pack off twice to fit through openings in the tunnels of the rocks. It took us 2 hours to get through it, although I think Subman could have gone much faster had he not been waiting on me. After getting through Mahoosuc Notch we came to a camp site. We decided to set up camp here. There was a nice area with great water. We cooked a hot meal and just as we finished it started to rain. The rain assured us we had made a good decision to set up camp, because the Mahoosuc Arm was next. The Arm is a steep up with rock slabs to maneuver over. Hopefully it will not be raining tomorrow.","Carlo Col Sheltet

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544467,"We were on the trail by 630am the night showers had stopped but had left the forest damp. We were heading into a 1500ft climb of the Mahoosuc Arm, a steep climb of boulders and rock slabs. At the top was a fantastic view, as we descended 400ft we arrived at Speck pond. The sky was a deep blue and the pond was surrounded by evergreens. Just past the pond was Speck Pond Shelter. We stopped for a bite to eat, and to look for Forrest and Hooshr. They had gone over Mahoosuc Arm in the rain last night. Forrest and Hooshr had left already so we got water and continued on to climb up Old Speck Mtn. This climb was one of the scariest for me. It was steep rock slabs with crevices to hold onto. After making it to the top I realized I had lost the bottom segment of my Leki hiking pole, there was no way I was going back down to look for it! After the summit we had a 2500ft descent of Old Speck. I was pleasantly surprised by the gentle descent and kind trail that took us into Grafton Notch. We stopped at the trailhead and cooked a hot lunch, two red squirrels and a chipmunk were frolicking near us, scurrying close by looking for handouts. We left the trailhead fueled to climb the 1100ft to Baldpate Lean-to. We discussed stopping for the day but when Subman and Rabbit got back from getting water, they had conspired together and we were pushing on to the next Shelter. The trail has been very hard with difficult rock scrambles which makes it hard to get our miles in. My body is usually beat by early afternoon. After Baldpate Lean-to was a 1000ft climb of Baldpate west peak, but it had nice stone steps to climb. The fun started with a steep down of flat rock face that lead over to the East peak of Baldpate. The East Peak was very exposed with Cairns leading us across the rocky mountaintop. At the top were small bunches of blueberries. Subman picked a handful for me as a peace offering for pushing on. They were so good I almost forgot how tired and sore I was. We then made the 1600ft descent to Frye Notch Lean-to. it was steep and had many rock slabs until about halfway down, then it turned to pleasant woods trail that lead us to the shelter by 530pm.","stealth camp

We had a short4.5 miles to go before being shuttled into the sleepy town of Andover. We are staying at the Pine Ellis Hostel. We ordered huge breakfasts at The Little Red Hen, Forrest and Hooshr were also there. Our breakfasts were delicious. With our bellies full we returned to the Hostel. It felt great to get showered after crawling and scooting on rocks for 4 days I was exhausted and quickly fell asleep for a nice nap. We did our laundry and took a quick inventory for our next 3 day stint. We went to the market that also has a deli. We gathered what we needed for resupply and ordered burgers. After finishing off our burgers we shared a pint of Moose tracks ice cream. Now we are relaxing and resting up, ready to take off early in the morning.","Frye Notch Lean-to

There was more than I could eat. It was a great place to eat before catching our 6am shuttle with Rabbit back to the trailhead. The trail was a dirt woods trail with a few roots and rocks. We began a 5 mile, 1500ft ascent of Wyman Mountain. There were no rock walls to climb, just good old dirt trail with a few Rock steps thrown in, It felt great. We had a 1900ft descent that was 3 miles long and gave you little flat areas to recover. At the bottom there was Sawyer Brook and a campsite with a picnic table and we decided to stop for lunch. Subman cooked a hot lunch and we were all very upbeat about getting 10 miles in before noon. That has not happened in a while. After lunch we did the 1400ft climb of Moody Mountain that was a 0.8 mile steep, rocky trail with a few well placed rebar steps, there were a lot of rock steps also which helped with walking on your toe tips because of the steepness of the mountain. Right before South Arm road there was a brand new handicap accessible privy, mind you this privy is on an uneven dirt trail barely wide enough to walk with rocks and roots and it has a ramp bigger than my front porch to make it compliant with government regulations of handicap accessibility, complete with handrails etc. This has been, a topic of discussion and the butt of a few jokes on the trail, to hardly be able to make it to the top of a mountain as pretty fit individuals and find the privies handicap accessible . I have been told, that if an organization accepts goverment monies to build the privies they have to follow the guidelines of the handicap accessibility act. This is where common sense has been tossed out the window and our tax money along with it. We got water at South Arm Road and took a rest before tackling our next big mountain, Old Blue. Old Blue Mtn. was a 2200ft climb over 3 miles. It seemed to go on forever. The top was pretty steep with walkable rock slabs. We reached the top which was cover by enough trees to block any view of the surrounding ridges. There were large boulders that we sat and rested on. As we were resting we were joined by a flip-flop hiker from Canada. During our pleasant conversation he gave us a pretty detailed acessment of the water and stealth camping sites at the bottom of old Blue. There was no water at the Bemis Mountain Lean-to, and it was a stretch to get there, so we found water at the bottom of Old Blue and Subman spied a sweet stealth campsite just big enough for two tents to squeeze in. We set up camp with our 2 tents close enough that Rabbit might have to worry about Submans snoring. nice and cozy. It felt great to get decent miles in today. 3 big mountains are tiring but there was no mountaineering skills required today!","Andover, ME

The trail was nice, even the 500ft climb to Bemis Mountain was enjoyable as it gave recovery periods of flat trail. When we got to the top of Bemis Mtn. there was a nice bench to enjoy the views. It is so nice to be out here with my best friend! As we came down Bemis Mountain, I was startled by someone coming fast uphill. It was Stripes, He threw his poles down immediately upon seeing us. he had been hiking hard for a couple of hours, When he saw us he realized it was the wrong way! He had gotten turned around on a reroute near the Bemis Mountain Shelter. Bad for him but he took it in stride, and we had the pleasure of his company for the day. we continued on to the second peak of Bemis Mtn. after completing the 1400ft descent, we stopped for A hot lunch at the campsite near Bemis stream. fueled up, Rabbit and Stripes take off with Sub and I shortly after to climb the 700ft to ME 17 where a bench and boulders greeted us for a rest. we hiked another 2 miles to Moxie pond. This pond had a Sandy beach and you could go out 100yds or so and only be waist deep. A great Sandy beach and being out 2 days in hot weather was a no brainer! I was the first one in. the water was cool but not cold and sooo refreshing! we stopped at the nearby shelter for snacks and decided to go onEven though we were tired, going on would cut down on the miles we needed to hike into Rangely the next day. We had 4 miles and some change to get to the Little Swift River Pond campsite. it was relatively easy and we arrived around 5pm. There was a privy before the campsite and a spring near the pond. There were a couple canoes there that Stripe would test later this evening. He didn't sink and came back alive! We were in our tents and dreaming of a town day in Rangely.","stealth camp

We were getting settled and went for breakfast at Moosley Bagels. We sat on the back deck that looked out on the lake to eat breakfast. There were seaplanes taking off and landing. It was a pretty awesome place to be. We went back to the hostel and Rabbits wife, Beth showed up with some wonderful goodies, Fresh fruit, cold drinks and a whole apple pie for Subman! talk about trail support! Beth is awesome. Knowing that she was coming today put an extra spring in Rabbit's step. We made her a golden trail angel, She is the perfect example of how important a love ones support is while you tackle the trail. I did laundry as the guys went on a resupply run. Subman took our poles to the outfitter to be fixed. By 2pm our chores were done and Forrest, Hooshr, Stripe and Subman were involved in a very competitive game of horseshoes. Then the topic of dinner came up and a quick run was made for roasted chicken for Subman and I.

On the way up Subman and I stopped at the Piazza Rock Lean-to. This Shelter had a two seater privy with a cribbage board in the middle, outside there was a sign that said ""Your Move"" a little play on words. We met Rabbit on top of Saddleback Mtn
and after taking in the views we began the 500ft descent only to climb 500ft to be at the Summit of The Horn. This was a steep climb with a few Rock slabs to go over and then a steep 900ft descent where we stopped for lunch that fueled us up for our last peak of the day, Saddleback Junior. Saddleback Junior is a very steep 900ft climb to the summit. All three of these peaks had magnificent 360 degree views, It was breathtaking! The trail was good and not as bad as we had feared it would be, although the climbs were tiring, we had cool overcast weather and all three of us were feeling pretty good. We went down to the Poplar Ridge Lean-to and decided to push on another 2.5 miles to knock out a long downhill that would take us to 1500ft elevation. We got water at the Orbeton Stream and went 0.1 mile straight up a hillside to stealth camp for the night. We were later joined by Stripe and another NOBO hiker.

The trail was good and it was a fairly easy climb with recovery areas of level trail. We walked a woody trail along a 2 mile Ridge to reach the base of Spaulding Mtn.. Spaulding was a steeper 700ft climb with Rocky boulders sporadically strewn about. At the base of Spaulding Mtns steep descent there was a Bronze plate embedded in a rock dedicated to all the work of the CCC in completing the AT. This plaque marked where the last segment of the AT was completed. It was also the place where us NOBO hikers had only 200 miles to go. We continued to walk woody trail for 3.5 miles and stopped at a campsite for a hot lunch. It was just after noon so we made the decision to conquer the next two peaks, the first being a 2000ft ascent to South Crocker. We took it slow and steady as it clouded up but didn't rain but a few sprinkles. The wind was cool and refreshing, gusting at times. We came down the north side of the peak it was steep and a little scary at times because it was so close to the edge. going up North Crocker was just as exposed and I almost let my fear of heights get the better of me as I focused on the rocks in front of me and not look down. After making the summit of North Crocker the descent was a little more gentle than I had anticipated. About one mile in the descent we crossed a spring and filled all our water bottles.

Towards the end of our day Subman, knowing my heart was heavy, suggested I try for a signal. There was one and I was able to talk with my Mom.

The trail was sloppy from the rain and very slippery with wet rocks and roots. Pleasant Pond Mountain had several false Summits each with its own little Rock climb. It got especially steep near the top. When we reached the summit there were no views because we were socked in a cloud with a light rain.

When we went North of the peak the wind was blowing and it was cold. We made it down to treeline which broke the wind and we again had beautiful stairs to go down, a nice change from rock scrambles. We stopped at Logan Brook Lean-to and had a hot lunch. We had our mountains pretty much behind us so we talked about making it a long day and getting closer to White house Landing where we planned to stay Thursday night. Subman and I left first and we're were covering quite a bit of trail since it was nice. We went up the 400ft Little Boardman Mtn. and coasted into the Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to. This was a. record mileage day for us. We are exhausted and ready to get some sleep.","Pleasant River

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546093,"we were on the trail by 615am. Rabbit was with us and we hoped we would catch Blues Brother before we got to White House Landing. As we walked along a flat woodsy trail we saw a rabbit head etched into the dirt. This could only mean one thing, Blues was ahead of us. We only had 14 miles to go before reaching our destination. After 8 miles we came into Antlers campsite. We were standing at the trail and campsite entrance when someone called out ""Subman?"", It was Purples! She was finishing her hike with her Dad, and she was still carrying Packasarus( her huge backpack) but this time she had Todo(sp) strapped to her pack. Todo is a hubcap someone found and it has been passed between hikers to carry North to Katahdin. After each Hiker carries it they get to sign it. Both Subman and I kindly declined custody with a chuckle. We continued on until the next Lean-to and fixed a hot lunch. We still had not caught up with Blues Brother. We had 2.5 miles to go to get to the White House Landing dock. We arrived by 1pm. Blues Brother had made it by 10am and was already at the lodge. We just missed lunch but enjoyed cold drinks and zucchini bread that held us over til the burgers and Pizza at supper. In the meantime I did laundry on a washboard and rinse tub from water hand pumped from the lake. White House Landing is absolutely wonderful. They have propane lights and appliances, a Bunkhouse or private rooms. We took showers, and basked in the sun, with a breeze blowing off the lake. After dinner Subman and I canoed out on the lake to catch a glimpse of Katahdin, boy was she magnificent! We will leave this paradise tomorrow after our AYCE breakfast.","Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546381,"We were up at 530am enjoying the spectacular views of the Lake and Sunrise of White House Landing. At 730am we met everyone in the Lodge House for breakfast. We were packed up and ready to go with our packs on the dock. As soon as breakfast was over we were taxied back to the dock and we're on the trail by 9am. We planned an easy 15 miles for today and we made our way over the rooty, rocky trail with ease. We followed the Nahmakanta stream a long way, crossing a campsite. We passed a Sandy beach of Nahmakanta Pond and stopped to eat the packed out Pizza from White House Landing on the beach. With only 9 miles to go we went over Nesuntabunt Mountain. Nesuntabunt was only a 600ft climb and we were assisted by rock stairs both up and down the mountain. With just 4.5 miles to go we again follow a River by the trail. Pollywog Gorge was beautiful with the rushing waters cutting through the stone to form beautiful gushing waterfalls. We follow the stream to Rainbow Stream Lean-to and pitch our tent above the shelter on the hilltop covered with massive pines. Subman cooked while I set up house and we were asleep at the leisurely hour of 630pm.","White house Landing

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546382,"We were on the trail by 615am and it started out pretty easy, turning into roots and rocks as we went. All the Southbound hikers said it was a carpet of pine needles and a walk in the park. perhaps that is further up the trail. It was easy in the sense that we had only one 500ft up today. Halfway through our day we climbed up Rainbow Ledges and was rewarded with a wonderful view of Mt. Katahdin. We sat on the rocks basking in the sun as we had peanut butter wraps for lunch. Our spirits were high as we finished the last of the 100 mile Wilderness. We crossed Abol Bridge and immediately got cold drinks and a hot lunch. After lunch Subman and Rabbit scoped out the camping options and we are staying at the Abol Bridge Campground. Spirit of 76 and Arachne came in shortly after us and have the site adjoining us. The campers here are not just thru hikers so hiker midnight is not a thing. Hopefully we will be rested for the 10 miles we are doing to the base of Katahdin tomorrow.","Rainbow Stream Lean-to

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546486,"We had a great breakfast at the Abol Bridge Campground then we were on the trail by 730am. The trail was easy and perhaps this was the pine needle carpet trail everyone was talking about. We entered the Baxter State Park boundaries. We crossed several footbridges over streams and bogs. We came to the Nesowadnehunk Stream. Subman and Rabbit managed to Rock hop the stream, but I didn't think I could do it, and stay dry so I put my crocs on and forded it. When we came to the upper fork of the river we all rock hopped it. We would occasionally cross paths with day hikers, many would offer their congratulations on our successful journeys. We made it to Katahdin Streams Campground around noon and stopped by the ranger station to register. The office was closed and we went back to the parking lot and Beth had just arrived. She had brought homade chocolate chip cookies and cold drinks and watermelon, all of which tasted awesome! We then ran into the ranger and she registered us to hike up Katahdin on Tuesday. Beth took us to our hotel. Rabbit, Stripe, and us were staying at the Katahdin Inn. As soon as we got there we were soaking in the hot tub. It felt so good on our tired bodies. Today Stripe, Blues Brother, Purples summitted Katahdin successfully. Stripe celebrated with his family and Blues Brother and Purples joined Rabbit, Beth, Arachne and her husband, Spirit of 76, Purples father, and us for dinner at Scotini to celebrate. Then it was back to the hotel to rest up.","Abol Bridge campground

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546510,"When we woke up this morning it was pouring out. The Weather man was right so we took a day of relaxation at the Katahdin Inn. We had breakfast at the hotel and mingled with the other hikers eating there and Thier families. Not Chris was getting ready to leave, He and Stripe had summitted on Sunday. After going back to our room we started going through our gear to lighten our packs as much as possible. Most hikers leave their packs at the ranger station and take a day pack. We had the luxury of having a room to leave our extra gear in. We took water, warm clothes, gloves, lunch, and Subman was smart and brought his knee braces which I ended up wearing. A group began to form and before we knew it there was a dozen of us sitting around the pool swapping hiking stories. A little later Stripe and his Brother-in-law joined us in the hot tub as others sat around it visiting. We went to McDonald's for lunch and came back to the room for a nap. We all met at the Scotic restaurant for dinner and talked about the mountain and our plans for the next day. I was carbing up with spaghetti and Sub ate his own pizza.Now for a good night's rest.","Katahdin Stream Campground/Millinocket

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546641,"We have been running around crazy since our summit day so Suds hasn't been able to update all the details. I just wanted to throw out a Big Time THANK YOU for all the warm wishes in our Guest book. You all were a big part of our hike whether you realize it or not.SubmanWe were up at 4am and left the hotel at 5am. Beth has been so wonderful taxiing us around, not just Rabbit but all four of us. sending us off with hugs and greeting us with cold drinks and fruit. She is amazing you just want to absorb her energy and hugs! Today we were lucky and she was going with us, joining Rabbit for the summit. We were in line a little before 6am at the gate and got through the gate by 630am. Beth had taken care of all the day passes and where we needed to be when so we just got in the car and arrived. 715am we were starting up Katahdin. The trail started out kind enough going up gently along Katahdin Streams and passing an impressive waterfall within a mile Shortly after the falls we began to crawl over some pretty large boulder scrambles, gaining elevation with each one. We continue to climb until we were out of treeline, then our real worries began, nothing but large boulders open to the gust of winds blowing on an awesome clear day. We came to a little break with a false summit then on up with more boulders that had a few rebar assists. I got my leg wedged between two boulders and cut it while trying to get it out. It will be fine so we move on. Finally we make it to the table lands that are much easier. Spirit had passed us up climbing the boulders like spider woman. She was the first to approach the sign. I teared up watching her. She did it!!! She sat for awhile and was holding her head in her hands as we approached. it was so emotional. Sub and I clasped hands and held tight. this was it our journey was coming to an end. We touched the sign laughing and crying at the same time. Spirit and I hugged as she said we F***ING made it! Thank you God for planting our feet and keeping us safe. We tried to eat but I was so nervous about climbing down this Mountain. It was a rough climb up Katahdin and I knew what we were in for. as we ate, Johnny and Abbey, a brother sister team summitted with there Mom and Abbey's husband Tim, Then Mustard Seed came up, He was hiking for 2 causes, big brother and big Sisters and friends of Barnabas. It was a very emotional time for him as he realized the great sucess of his hike for the charities and how God walked with him to keep him safe. In the short distance we see Beth with Rabbit coming across the table lands. When Rabbit arrives he comes to each of us first and we all hug, what a triumphant summit for him, overcoming Lymes disease and Beth there as she has been to support him. It was amazing and it gets better as Forrest and Sherri arrive. I can not believe the determination of the family members, Katahdin was tuff and they were there right beside their loved ones. Support from those you love is very important to being successful and we were fortunate to have a lot of love and support from home. As we were leaving the table lands Hooshr was coming up. I gave him a hug and congratulating him. Hooshr had more than his fair share of ailments that he pushed through towards the end of our trip. This hike requires more than a little grit! We continue down the mountain, taking our time as downhills have always been hard for me. I did a lot of butt scooting and was so relieved to make it to the treeline where I knew it got easier. We were off the mountain by 415pm and waited with Spirit and soon Arachne and her Husband joined us to celebrate the relief that today's hike was successful. Everyone of us has a story of what we overcame, and what the trail taught us. they are deep rooted and will forever be a part of our lives.And all of our Trail Journals family and our trail Angels have touched us in ways you'll never know. like when Trail Chef came to Sam's Gap and hid trail magic for us. He had no way of knowing we were at the nitty gritty bottom of our food bags, no doubt God sent you to us, so far from your home. Real Deal who came to meet us when the freezing rains made us fall short of our goals. Iceman who rode his bike up a gaming road then hiked into a shelter to give us aqua Mira. these are the people of the trail. they are so amazing, I know I didn't touch on all of you, Barnyard, Hat Lady, Grambo, our neighbors Cliff and Doris, Bill and Carol,all of you are amazing and if the world were the trail we would have no problems.","Millinocket Katahdin Inn

Subman and Suds,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547092,"As I'm sitting here at Suds parents house in Ohio I feel I need to put my feelings into words.Our Summit day was greater than AWESOME to me. Everything just fell into place as it did on the whole hike. I was always comparing this Thru to the one I did in 2003. It was one extreme to the other. In 03 it rained constantly and I only took 8 zeroes. This year we had the most Awesome weather and took our time enjoying the trail and each other just the way we planned. In 03 it took me 2 days short of 5 months to complete. This trip 6 months and 1 week. Of course in 03 finances were low and I had to basically live out of the Hiker Boxs. This trip was planned better so we could stay in town more and enjoy.And of course doing it with Suds the Love of my Life. She was so Awesome the way she kept plugging along, an amazing strong woman.I wanted so much to have a clear summit day cause in 03 I couldn't see anything. I always said I would wait a week if I had to for clear weather to summit but only had to wait one day, so cool.God is SO good allowing me to do this again and keeping us safe the entire way. Praise him.Going up Katahdin is by far the ultimate finish for this hike. I love Springer, I moved there to live closer to the Trail. But I could never understand how going SOBO, and finishing at Springer could ever compare to Katahdin.We hiked the trail OUR WAY. We carried our packs and passed every white blaze going north the whole way. Even in and out of shelters, coming out the same way we went in.We have nothing against those who Slackpack, yellow blaze or cover trail sobo while going Nobo. That's why HYOH has such great meeting. It's your memory your making, no one else's. The trail is SO AWESOME in that way.  The people truly make the Appalachian Trail the mother of all trails.I want to close by saying a big Thank you to you all. The trail angels, friends, family and fellow hikers. The readers of this journal for following along and the comments in our guest book. You all are truly a gift to us.Subman GA-ME 2016",,going home,"Aug 28, Sun",0
