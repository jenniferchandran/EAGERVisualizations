Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520046,"HI everyone. Happy New Year. My name is Jedi Night. I am a 2 1/2 year old black Lab so I guess that makes me a teenager in human years. I come from from a long line of Jedi masters. I am as black as the Arizona desert night sky. I am part of an extended human family. I live with Papa Will and RoadRunner. And like them, I love to hike. Will and RoadRunner always wanted a dog but their penchant for wandering the long trails of the American west made it impractical until RR approached my other human Papa, Matt (Will's youngest), with the grand idea of sharing a dog. This allows them to go on their long distance hikes. When they are gone hiking I stay with Papa Matt and his girlfriend Alyssa.   Here is a picture of me on my first day at my new house. I was only 8 weeks old. I was scared but only for a day or so. I loved my new home.    I can hike 15-20 miles a day. I love to run. I like it when it rains out here in Arizona so I can run through the mud puddles. I don't like the heat. When it gets too hot I head to the pool. When the sun beats down on my black coat I start looking for the shade. I thought about going on this AT hike but as much as I love to hike, I think I like to sleep just as much. When I am done with our hikes I like a good meal and a nice soft piece of carpet for a good 4 hour nap. I am not sure if I would like to hike 20 miles day after day. So I will be hanging out at Papa Matt's (Here's a pic of Papa Matt) while Papa Will and RR head north on the AT.      When I am at Papa Matt's I hang out with my little sister Rosalita. Rosie is Alyssa's and Matt's dog.    She likes to play all day long. If I need a rest, I head to the pool for a swim. Rosie doesn't like the water, the pool is my little oasis in the desert.   I have a lot of friends. Everyone is my friend. Recently I got a girlfriend. Here name is Molly. Here's a picture of Moll.     Isn't she a cutey? She's a little German Shepherd pupster. She got to stay with us for a couple of weeks when her mom and pop went to Mexico. She has the biggest ears I have ever seen on a dog. I like tugging on them.    Papa Matt says that he will take care of me for 4 months. So they have 4 months to complete their hike. I'll be following their progress in this journal. When it starts to heat up here in Arizona this spring, I'll be at my favorite watering hole chillin' with the gang at the pool. Gotta keep cool.    May the force be with youJedi Night",,Jedi Night,"Jan 01, Fri",0
Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520087,"Jedi has become a big part of our family. Now that you have met him, I'd like to to introduce the rest of the family. At home, I go by Will. It is a nickname. I was given the trail name Desert Nomad by a friend out here in Arizona. I like the name. It seems appropriate for the deserts of the southwest but not so much for a trail like the AT. So for now, I'll go with my nickname Will.   My hiking partner of the last 19 years is RoadRunner. That is her trail name and the name she goes by in trail community. However whether we are at home or on trail, I almost never call her RoadRunner unless other hikers are around. To me she is my dear Annie. Another nickname (see Sleepless in Seattle). But for journaling purposes I sometimes flip flop back and forth between RR and Annie.   Now that I have the introductions out of the way, let's get on to our 2016 hike on the AT. When we returned to Arizona last September after hiking the GDT in Canada, we sat down and discussed some ideas for future hikes. We have a list of hikes that we would eventually like to do. We have a sense of urgency as age and health become factors.   So focusing on the immediate future, we both decided we wanted to do as much hiking in 2016 as possible. The more time on the trails the better. While the GDT ended up being a great hike, we would have liked more time on the trail and more continuity. At times our hike last summer seemed a bit disjointed.   We wanted to try to get in an early season hike. I floated the idea of rehiking the Arizona trail and then completing the western portion of the Hayduke route. Annie had enough of the Hayduke the first time around, so that was out. The weather forecasts are calling for an El Nino winter with heavy snow accumulations out in the western mountain regions of the US. With that in mind, we decided to look eastward and do some research on the AT.   Although we have spent most of our time hiking in the western US, the AT looked appealing. After all it is the oldest continuous footpath in the US. We would be hiking through 14 states and many of those states were the foundation of the US from early colonial times. There is a lot of history there. And it would give us both a chance to see a different part of the country. A part which neither of us has explored. We have only hiked small portions of the AT in Georgia, the Smokies and Shenandoah NP.   We gave ourselves a December 1st deadline. After taking time for consideration, we decided to give it a whirl. So now we are 'all in' on the AT. We have been planning and training for the last 6 weeks.   Our son Matt has given us the OK from his end. He is willing to watch Jedi for 4 months. So our next decision was which 4 months? Will",,'All In' on the AT,"Jan 04, Mon",0
Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520092,"I don't necessarily like the cold. I don't do well in the cold. We have had a couple of close calls with hypothermia on our long distance hikes. It is scary how fast conditions can turn from bad to worse.   Cold weather and long periods of grey skies led us to flee Michigan for the warmer climate of the Arizona desert. So you might ask why are we planning on a winter start for our AT hike? We have our airline tickets for Atlanta. We are leaving February 24th.   We plan to spend a few days visiting with Annie's Mom, brothers, and children Wendy and Justin who all live in the Atlanta-Gainesville area. We will take a few days to gather up a few resupply boxes that will help us get through the first part of the trail. Then we will head out to the Amicalola Falls approach trail. We plan to be at Springer Mountain by March 1st.   After carefully considering our start date, we decided that a March 1st start date had some advantages even with all the cold weather that start date entails. Some of the benefits: less bugs initially, the possibility of more solitude, less crowds as the greater majority of hikers start after March 15th. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) is expecting record numbers of hikers this year with over 3000 hikers attempting a thruhike. They have encouraged hikers to consider alternate start dates, flip flop hikes or going southbound to decrease trail congestion. We would like to do our part.    Finally we have a 4 month window to complete our hike. That means we have to be back in Arizona by July 1st. This gives us the option of a late summer hike in the Sierra or Wind River Range. So in the end it was all or nothing; either March 1st or stay home. We know that it will be a tough hike starting in winter. We will hope for mild weather but make plans for worst case scenario. I'll talk about some of our gear choices and plans next time.Will",,A Winter Hike,"Jan 07, Thu",0
Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520097,"Hoping for the best, expecting the worst. We are expecting rain, a lot of rain. With a March 1st start we could see temps and wind chills down to zero degrees. The big question is can we stay warm and avoid getting hypothermic. We have run into winter conditions on some of our previous hikes during the shoulder season. Unfortunately we had 3 season gear, when we needed 4 season gear. It cost us a thruhike of the PCT in 2013 when we ran into a blizzard in northern Washington that dumped 4 feet of snow on the trail in 48 hours. We were a 125 miles from the border. We ended up going back the next year to finish. Disappointing.   Our system has changed somewhat since I provided a gear list for our 2013 PCT hike. If interested go back and check out our gear list. Here is what has changed: We have switched from a tarp to a HMG Cuben fiber Pyramid tent. We call it the 'Palace'.    Huge. Plenty of room for us, our gear and our dog. It is absolutely bombproof in the rain.   We will switch out to our heavier sleeping bags. We have the Montbell Down Spiral Hugger 15 degree bags. We bought new NeoAir xlites to replace our old NeoAirs. Great comfort and insulating properties. We have added Exped UL pillows. More comfort. We may need them as we may be wearing more of our clothes at night to stay warm.   For rain protection we will carry our GoLite umbrellas. Annie bought a new Outdoor Reasearch women's Aspire rain jacket. I splurged on an Arc'teryx Theta LT rain jacket. Still looking for something that will keep us relatively dry in a downpour.   We will be going with our heavier and puffier Westen Mountaineering Flight down jackets along with extra layers: Montane wind shirt and Ibex merino wool hoodies and an extra fleece. We will have two sets of gloves: one will stay dry at all times for night time sleeping and one will be for hiking in foul weather. I bought a pair of North Face gortex mittens and some hand warmers.   It sounds like a lot of extra gear and it is. We aren't taking any chances.   It will definitely be extra weight in our packs but we will try to resupply often thereby carrying less food. Hopefully it will even out somewhat. If we have milder weather, hey we'll take it.   Finally we will be carrying Kahtoola Microspikes when necessary for icy trail conditions. I think that covers most of the major changes. If anyone has any other ideas, drop us a line. We are open to suggestions.Will",,Winter Gear,"Jan 10, Sun",0
Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520198,"People spend a lot of time in the pursuit of happiness. Have you ever noticed? And yet very few people in this group (which is comprised of pretty much everyone) ever truly grab hold of it, at least not for very long. Even though they throw a lot of money and time trying to find happiness.You're probably wondering why I'm bringing this up right? Well, simply put, I'm in a place in my life where I feel really happy. And not just fleetingly. I'm not sure when I realized it. Maybe a couple of years ago. People would ask me about how things were going, how my hike had gone or how work was going. I would tell them; and then I would say, 'I love my life!'. They would usually give me a look and say 'I love your life too!'I love my split life. Hiking and living life out of a backpack for half of the year. And sleeping on my King sized pillow top bed, cantering through the desert on my horse Cheyenne or looking at cute little babies still in the uterus with Ultrasound for the other half of the year.It helps that I have an amazing, adventurous husband, a great family and awesome friends of course.   They are a big part of my whole 'I love my life' expression. But really, happiness is within you as they say. I have come to a place where I am happy in all my skins. I am happy as a long distance hiker, and I am grateful to have the health to be attempting the Appalachian Trail.   I am happy as a wife, mom, friend and Sonographer. And I am blessed to have these people and this job in my life.Does this mean I am never unhappy? You betcha, every moment of every day I am happy, happy, happy!   Ha! Just kidding! Of course there are times when things happen and I am not so happy. But I'm talking about the big picture here.And right now that picture includes me with my backpack, hiking down the Appalachian Trail with my husband by my side. Like I said, I love my life!Road Runner",,I Love My Life,"Jan 12, Tue",0
Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520201,"It occurred to me the other day as I looked into the mirror, that there are really two me's. I had just finished getting ready. Makeup on, hair blown out and styled and dressed up to go out. The reflection looking back at me was, well, alright. I don't think there is a woman on this planet that looks at herself and says, dahling, you look absolutely perfect! Even the ones that do look perfect from our viewpoint find something wrong from theirs. But alright is pretty high praise coming from me. And just at that moment, as I was still looking at my reflection, it came to me that in about a month I would look nothing like this me. I would look like the other me. The one with no make up, barely combed dirty hair (hidden under a hat) dirty stinky hiking clothes and an unwashed body.   I ask you, how many women are willing to go to that space for 4 to 6 months?   But I love being that me. Oh, not the unkempt, less made up part so much. But the me that sets a goal to hike a couple thousand miles and reaches that goal. The me that spends every day wandering down a trail being blown away by the views. Or the me that sits out in nature just plain 'being', nothing else, just occupying that moment of time.   I think we all want other people to look at us with approval. Women especially. That's why a lot more women wear makeup then men (well there ARE some men who wear makeup ). But if I am honest, I am more my true self out on the trail. Sans the make up, au natural.   Nothing to cover up my faults. Just me, as I truly am. And it's much less time consuming, I'll tell you that much! So I'm okay with both me's. The city girl me and long distance backpacking me.   But if you chance to meet us on the Appalachian Trail and take our picture, could you make sure I get good lighting? And no close ups please!

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520282,"There are two elements of a long distance hike which characterize the essence of the journey: simplicity and freedom. Life is simple. We carry everything we need on our back. We sleep, we eat, we hike. We revel in the beauty of the natural world. I find myself shifting into a more contemplative dimension. There is joy in being.In looking back on our other longer hikes, I would say that they were pretty much free flowing affairs. No schedules, put in our miles. Hike on! Last year on our GDT hike there were certain areas where it was mandatory that we camp in designated campsites. Initially it kind of grated on me. It was the first time where I felt that we were on a schedule. Quite frankly in my workaday life I had enough of schedules and regimentation.I love the freedom of a long distance hike. We have 4 months to complete the AT. So this hike will definitely be more structured. I would even go so far to say that we will have a 'loose' schedule. We really thought long and hard about even attempting the AT.    But in the end, we decided on a thruhike. All or nothing. We definitely will need to catch a few breaks along the way with decent weather, good health and avoidance of injury.   I always found Salvador Dali's paintings interesting; especially the ones with the warped clocks. Have you ever noticed how our experience of time is so subjective? There are moments when time moves ever so slowly. Time stands still. Where did the time go? Our preparation and training has moved to the forefront. We are trying to put together a plan. We are only a little more than a month away from heading out to Georgia. That is hard to believe. The clock is ticking. This year we are on the clock.Will",,On the Clock: The Tyranny of a Schedule,"Jan 17, Sun",0
Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520300,"The other day I looked at the sidebar of our Appalachian Trail Journals entry and was startled to see that this years journal will be our 10th. I know, I know, I shouldn't really be startled at the number of journals on my own page. And yet I was. I guess I never really thought about it, or didn't bother to count. I think the thing that made me take a look was, that while we were on a training hike a couple days ago, Will had sort of wondered out loud if we had anything left to say in a journal after all the journal pages we have cranked out over the years. My response to him then was, yes but this is a whole nother trail that we have never hiked and we will have unique trail experiences to share. But will we? I mean there are a ton of people hiking the trail this year. Thousands, and while not every hiker will keep a journal, a whole bunch of them will. What will make our journal worth the space it takes up on Trailjournals.com?  It made me stop and think about why we keep a journal in the first place. There are several reasons actually. I think the first one is so that our close family and friends can sort of keep tabs on us and know that we are safe (most of the time). The other is so that people in the hiking community can come along vicariously, or maybe glean a few tips about hiking a better hike, either from the things we got right, or the mistakes we made along the way. And the last reason, is for ourselves. Our first journal we didn't really think of that. We were doing it mostly for our family and friends. But when we got home, we realized that there was absolutely no way we would have remembered so many fine details and feelings from our hike had we not journaled them. We have cross referenced our journals many times, or maybe just spent part of a day soaking in the memories of a certain hike.I believe that no two people ever have the same experience, because, well, they are two different people. So while we may walk the same stretch of trail as hundreds of other people, we bring our own unique upbringing, values, skills set, literary ability, trail experience and knowledge. Ten journals worth of trails versus someone else who is taking their maiden voyage on the Appalachian Trail, is told in a vastly different way.So we invite you to come along with us on our journey(Journey/Journal, sound alot alike don't they?) We will try and make it worth the effort and the time you invest in it. But if we're less than perfect, I am okay with that, because as in a true journal, it's just me and Will writing about things as we see and experience them.. Journalistically speaking that is.RoadRunner",,Journalistically Speaking,"Jan 19, Tue",0
Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520444,"Professor can you give me a hand in doing a math problem. OK we have 4 months to hike the trail. That gives us 17 full weeks. How many miles do we have to average a day to get to Katahdin?Well let's see. 17 weeks x 7 days = 119 days. So we have a total of 119 days. Sounds good.But we need some rest days. So how about 1 zero or nero day a week. That's 17 days119 - 17 = 102. Now we are down to 102 total hiking days.We have 2180 miles to cover.   2180 / 102 = 21.37. Let's round it off.Ta Da!!! The magic number is 21.5 miles/day.21.5 miles/day sounds kind of daunting at this time considering that our longest training hike has been only 14 miles with 3000 feet of elevation gain.If we want to make it to Katahdin we are going to have to hit the trail motoring. And we will need plenty of good weather. Our plan at the beginning is to do as many miles as we can to get us near to our daily goal of 21.5 We will start off slower allowing ourselves 2-3 weeks to get trail tough. We have found that no matter how much prehike training we put in, it takes us a minimum of 2-3 weeks before we can start cranking and hike a full day.If all goes well we will pick up our mileage in the middle states to make up for whatever deficiency we incur at the start. Hopefully we will build up a cushion to allow for less miles per day through the Northern states. That's the game plan. Sounds pretty simple. Actually it sounds too simple; and a bit regimented to me. Maybe too much like a schedule. Actually it is only a broad outline. Once we hit the trail, we will be in 'go with the flow' mode focusing on the beauty of the AT.Will",,Doing The Math: The Magic Number is 21.5,"Jan 22, Fri",0
Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520649,"Annie got a new Samsung Galaxy Note 5. We will be using it on trail to transcribe our entries on to Trailjournals. So I thought that I would give it a try today to see if I could get it to work. I am not very tech savvy but I am impressed at what these smart phones can do. The camera on this phone is excellent. I will try and post a few photos from our morning hikes.Preparation for our hike is coming along nicely. We continue to do some low level training. We are trying to avoid getting too gung ho. It is a great time to be hiking the Arizona desert. The nights are cool. There is frost on the ground in the morning so we can hike freely without having to worry about rattlesnakes. AWOL's AT guide has arrived and we have had a chance to look it over. It looks like an excellent resource. We also downloaded Guthook's App. This also looks like an excellent tool.   We have the free Amicalola Falls approach trail section and have purchased the first section from Springer Mt to Mile 241 Standing Bear Farm. We will see how it goes and then decide if we want to pay for sections further on up the trail.I have been following Slipknot, Blizzard and AK on Trailjournals. Good hiking to all.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520764,"Since we left Michigan, we have done all of our hiking out west. I really didn't know much about the AT. I read Bill Bryson's book A Walk in the Woods many years ago. Since we started to consider an AT hike and then actually committed to the hike, I have been doing a ton of reading. One of the things that I have learned from reading various journals and books is that the AT is extremely well marked. The actual trail is marked with white rectangular 2"" x 6"" blazes, which are painted on the trees, rocks and mountain pathways. I have read and some have suggested that the trail is so well marked, one need not carry maps. WOW!!! Are they pulling my leg? Here is a picture of an official AT white blaze. This is totally different from what we are used to and what we have encountered on some of our other hikes. The PCT is very well marked but I would never consider going without a map; especially through the snow covered Sierra. Last year on the GDT we had several miles of bushwacking and a few long cross country stretches. Map and compass were essential.We will carry maps on the AT. No matter how well marked the AT is, I am sure that I will manage to get us off trail at some point as I mindlessly zone out on a climb and miss a white blaze at a turnoff. Side trails or spur trails are marked by blue blazes. And this leads to some jargon which is unique to the AT.White Blazer: A hiker who is attempting to hike past each white blaze. A puristBlue Blazer: A hiker who hikes a section of blue blazed trail as an alternate to the white blazed ATYellow Blazer: A hiker who skips a section of trail by hitch hiking ie. following the yellow line (blaze) of the highway Finally, here's one I didn't know about. Aqua Blazer: a hiker who canoes a 50-60 stretch of river through Shenandoah Nat'l Park.Here are a few other terms used by long distance hikers:Zero Day: Zero miles hiked. A town day or rest dayNero: A short mileage day. Usually heading in to or out of a town resupplyBeero: Zero miles hiked due to a hangoverSlackpacking: This would be somewhat analagous to day hiking on a long distance hike. The hiker carries what is needed to hike that day's mileage while having their pack transported up the trail.Flip Flop: A hiker starts in one direction; reaches a certain point and then skips ahead and hikes back to the point where they skipped ahead. ie. Springer Mt to Harper's Ferry. Skip to Katahdin, then hike back to Harper's Ferry. Or some variant thereof. The ATC is encouraging hikers to consider a flip flop hike this year to help lighten the trail load as record number of hikers attempting a thruhike are expected.HYOH: Hike your own hike. The freedom to choose one's own pace or style of hiking.Which brings us to our hike. Our goal is to hike a continuous footpath from Springer Mt to Katahdin along the AT. We are not purists. If we decide to take a blue blazed trail to a spring, we may choose not to retrace our steps backwards to where we left the 'official' AT, if the blue blaze connects up the trail with the AT. We like the idea of being able to define our hike. HYOH. For us a corollary of HYOH is MYOB. Mind your own business. We try not to be judgmental in regards to other hikers and how they choose to hike. We refrain from giving unsolicited advice. There is definitely more than one way to do a long distance hike and our way is not the only way or right way.We look forward to meeting our fellow hikers on the AT this year whether they are thruhikers, section hikers or day hikers. It should be a blast. Looking forward to a walk in the woods.Will",,Blazing the Trail,"Jan 28, Thu",0
Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521384,"As I noted in my last entry, I really don't know much about the AT. I read Bill Bryson's A Walk in the Woods shortly after it was published. I thought that parts of it were funny but overall I wasn't inspired to put on my pack and do an AT hike. Since my initial reading of the book, we have done three very short hikes on the AT: in Georgia around Neels Gap, 60 miles in the Smokies and a few miles in Shenandoah Natl Park. That's it. Pretty limited.In preparing for this hike, I decided to read a few AT books. A Walk in the Woods is number one on the list of Best Appalachian Trail Books on Goodreads. It has 80% 4 and 5 star ratings on reviews at Amazon. Based on this I decided to reread the book.Bryson does a good job of going over the history of the AT. He covers bears, cougars, hypothermia and environmental issues. He makes fun of southerners in a stereotypical manner. He doesn't like most of the trail towns. He doesn't like Thoreau: 'priggish and wearisome'. The woods seem dark and foreboding. He would have liked a wilderness that was a bit more genteel. He seemed woefully unprepared at times. Leave No Trace Ethic had been around for years when he wrote the book. The idea of Katz, his buffoon of a hiking partner (whether real or fictional), jettisoning food and gear along the trail didn't strike me as funny Some of the humor is at the expense of others and at times condescending. For many hikers, an AT hike is a life long dream. There was none of that in this book. In fact, I never got the sense that Bryson was ever comfortable on trail or that he enjoyed his hike. Bryson is a good writer. I can give this book a decent grade as a fictional comedic farce. But as a hiking book, I found it once again uninspiring. There are better books and journals out there that cover the AT from a hiking perspective. I am a fan of Robert Redford as an actor and director. I like what he has done with the Sundance Film Festival. But the movie A Walk in the Woods was terrible. It missed on so many levels. Where was the beauty of the trail? I got a few chuckles here and there but overall I found it disappointing. I think that the AT deserved better.Will",,A Walk in the Woods Revisited,"Jan 31, Sun",0
Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521389,"So I didn't care for A Walk in the Woods from a hiking perspective but I have read several books that I found to be of value.1) Beyond Backpacking by Ray Jardine. Although this isn't a book strictly about the AT, it covers the philosophy of thruhiking and lightweight backpacking. I think that Ray has hiked the AT three times, the most recent in 2010. This book is a classic. I believe there is a new edition called Trail Life. It changed the way we hike. Grade A 2) Grandma Gatewood's Walk by Ben Montgomery. I first heard about Grandma Gatewood in Ray Jardine's book. Here was a woman who set out to hike the AT in her 60s with a duffel bag, a shower curtain for her shelter and sporting Keds sneakers.   It covers the spousal abuse GG suffered and her subsequent escape to and healing on the AT. A great story about a very strong willed woman. Well written. Grade A-3) AWOL on the Appalachian Trail by David Miller. This book reads like a journal and is a bit dry. There isn't a lot of emotion or introspection. In fact David admits somewhere in his book that he doesn't have any great epiphanies. It has value in giving a good overall perspective of the day to day events of a thruhike. Grade B4) On the Beaten Path: An Appalachian Pilgrimage by Robert Rubin. This book is more emotional and introspective than AWOL's book. Robert is a good writer. Middle aged, quit his job at a publishing company. Completed a thruhike. Lost 75 lbs. Honest about his conflicted feelings in regards to the effect his hike had on his wife and their marital relationship. Grade B+5) Walking With Spring by Earl Shaffer. I liked this book. It has historical value. Earl was the first thruhiker. He completed his hike in 1948 when many thought an end to end hike of the AT in one season was impossible. Grade B6) Lost on the Appalachian Trail by Kyle Rohrig. Kyle completed a thruhike, most of it with his little dog. Kyle isn't a great writer but he captures the essence of a thruhike. Out of all the AT books I read I enjoyed this one the most. Kyle is able to convey the ups and downs of a thruhike: the elation and difficulty; the life changing nature of a long distance hike. Grade A- Last but not least is Appalachian Trials by Zach Davis. I think that this is a good read and an important book. I'll cover it in a separate post.Three weeks until our departure to Georgia.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521473,"""Hiking the Appalachian Trail is 90% mental and 50% physical.""Yogi BerraYogi was actually talking about baseball but he could have been talking about long distance hiking. In Appalachian Trials, Zach Davis covers the mental-psychological-emotional aspects of long distance hiking. 70% of hikers attempting a northbound thruhike fail to reach Katahdin? Zach lists a number of reasons for the high failure rate and gives some practical advice on how to overcome some of the obstacles one encounters on a long distance hike.This isn't a book which emphasizes the physical aspects of hiking ie. training, nutrition or gear selection. I'm not sure what percentage of the hike is physical and how much is mental. But as I get older, the physical obstacles are becoming more noticeable. I can't hike the way I did 10 years ago. I can make adjustments. But if I don't have my head on right and I don't have the right mindset, it doesn't matter how light my pack is, I'm setting myself up for a miserable hike.This book has value in that it is one of the few books that I have encountered on thruhiking that deals with the mental-emotional-psychological dynamics of thruhiking. I give it an A-.One of the exercises in the book is to focus on the question WHY? Why am I hiking the AT? When the romance of hiking the AT wears off and I have to trudge through snow for two weeks, or I am wet, cold and borderline hypothermic after five days of continuous rain, or the mosquitoes and black flies are driving me insane; when I have about had it and I look at Annie and I say 'why are we doing this'?

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521881,"Ask fifty thruhikers why they hike and you are likely to get fifty different answers: the physical challenge, getting fit, connecting with nature and the cosmos, to enjoy the the camaraderie of the hiking tribe, to find oneself, to sort out life's problems and on and on.One of the exercises in Zach Davis' book Appalachian Trials is to write down one's reason for hiking the AT. I think that every hiker instinctively and organically knows why they hike. Having said that, deep down I know why I hike, but I have never really taken the time to articulate 'a big why'.Simply put, I hike to get HIGH. The longer the hike, the greater the change in consciousness; the deeper the connection to nature and the earth. Hiking for me has always had a spiritual component to it. Pilgrimage and quest are words which come to mind and loosely define the broad view. It is never always about the destination but the day to day journey and the deepening of experience.Beauty is the ongoing fuel and food which propels me down the trail and up to the passes. I am a junkie. I can never get enough of the natural beauty which surrounds us. Leaving behind the world of comfort, I find myself coming alive.Finally I find that the beauty and the highs are more pronounced and more intense when shared with my hiking partner of almost twenty years, the incomparable and one and only RoadRunner. Synergy 1=1+3. I always liked the word synergy. There is a lot of energy buried in that word. When we are hiking at our best we are feeding off of each others energy. The mutually shared joy seems to lift us to another level.Will",,Why?????????,"Feb 10, Wed",0

When I think of 'Purple Haze' the first association that comes to mind is Hendrix. ""Scuse me while I kiss the sky"". It would make for a great story if there was some Hendrix connection, but this Purple Haze is a long distance hiker and fly fisherman extraordinaire.PH actually refers to a fly that is used in Montana and since PH has done quite a bit of fishing on the Montana streams his trail name relates strictly to flyfishing. PH is a fellow Arizoner who we met on the PCT in 2013. We enjoyed hiking a portion of the desert with him. He hiked the AZT in 2012 and is now section hiking the CDT.We drove down to Tucson on Valentine's day and did a 7.5 mile training hike through the beautiful Sonoran desert. Annie, PH and I had a good time catching up on the hiking life. And there was just enough water in the washes for our lab Jedi to get wet and keep cool.Afterward we went to a nice Mexican restaurant. We got a chance to meet the lovely Mrs Haze and spend some time with her. It was a real nice outing. Thanks again PH for the meal. Greatly appreciated.This week will be my last week of training before we head out to Georgia. My legs are still feeling a bit weak, so I am going to push the climbing. I will cut back on my mileage but increase the intensity and steepness of the climbs.Hopefully that will help me get ready for the big climbs in Georgia that our friends have warned us about.Will",,Hiking with Purple Haze,"Feb 16, Tue",0
Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521886,"I found out last summer that expectations can derail a hike in no time. When we hiked the GDT in Canada, I had made the assumption that the GDT would be similar to the Roper's Sierra High Route. I had made this assumption after looking at all the pictures in the guide book which showed the panoramic views from the high passes. Stunning!There were stunning views from the high passes but there were many miles of being locked in the forest on often poor trail. Combine that with lousy weather and cold wet rain and needless to say, it wasn't what I expected. I wasn't a happy camper and mid hike I considered bailing. In the end it was just a transient meltdown and I'm glad that I persevered. The hike just kept getting better the further north we hiked.I am going into this AT hike with low expectations. I'm expecting lousy weather. Wind, rain and snow. It's still winter.   Limited views. The 'green tunnel' effect. We are preparing for worst case scenarios. Our base weight will be up 3 or 4 lbs with additional clothing and winter gear.One of the biggest reasons for thruhiker failure is unmet expectations. 'It's just not what I expected'. I can honestly say that I have checked my excitement at the door. Will low expectations help? Not sure. They are still expectations. I guess conditions could always be worse.The AT has never been at the top of our hiking list. In fact at one point someone asked us about the AT and we just said we didn't have much interest. But here we are a few days from takeoff to Georgia. So never say never. I am ready to love the AT. I just hope that I am not expecting too much.Will",,Expectations,"Feb 20, Sat",0

You know the one. 'All my bags are packed and I'm ready to go.... I'm leaving on a jet plane, don't know when I'll be back again...'(quick factoid: John Denver wrote and sang this song but it was Peter, Paul and Mary that made it famous) well, I sort of know when I'll be back again. But I don't know exactly when I'll be back again, so I guess it fits.Once we got on the plane and we were in the air, it sort of hit me that I'm really on the verge of hiking the Appalachian Trail. We are past the planning stage. Past the packing stage. Past the getting er done stage. We have entered the Adventure Begins stage. And that is an awesome stage to be in. We arrived in Atlanta and collected our baggage, then headed out to wait for my brother Doug to pick us up. That's when the reality of winter hiking sort of set in for me. It was cold! When we left Phoenix we had 80 degree weather and above. It was much colder here. And Atlanta is not even high in elevation. Well, we have brought our winter hiking gear, let's hope it does the job!We have quite a bit of family here. My daughter Wendy lives in Atlanta and also my son Justin . Both of my brothers live in Atlanta and Gainesville Georgia plus a niece and nephew. And of course my mother. Everyone is pitching in to help us get what we need to do done as well as drive us various places. We really appreciate it and are thankful to have them nearby.A couple more days and we will truly be on the trail. We plan to start the approach trail this Saturday, 27th February.

They are native Minnesotans who moved to Georgia 7 years ago. Cherie is planning an AT thruhike in 2017. We had met via our journal and got together last night for dinner and some good hiker talk. It was a real nice way to head into our hike. Thanks again for dinner. I am sure that Cherie will enjoy her hike and do well.This morning Denny, Annie's older brother drove us to Amicalola State Park. After taking a few pictures we went into the visitor center and signed in at the through hiker registration. We were hikers 211 and 212. Wow that seems like a lot of hikers already on trail and it is still winter. We got started around 10 o'clock. It was cold but clear. We climbed the steps to the top of the falls and then headed off on the AT approach trail. We could not have asked for better weather. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. I was able to stay warm while hiking in my base layer and wind shirt. We met a lot of weekend hikers who were out enjoying the sunshine. We did meet one thruhiker by the name of Matthew. We have a nice campsite. The late afternoon light is filtering through the bare trees. Tomorrow we officially start our AT hike. We are at T-1 and counting.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522234,"Since we quit a little early last night, we were in bed pretty early too. This must be why at about 3:00am I found myself laying there awake. At about 3:30am I heard Will stirring, so I called out. ""I'm awake!!!"". To which he replied ""it's too early to go anywhere, go back to sleep!!!"". It sort of reminded me of the little child who goes running into his parents bedroom at 2:30 am on Christmas morning yelling "" It's Christmas! Can we open our presents now?"" And the dad yells back "" It's way too early! Go back to bed!"". But I am wide awake by this time and I have already slept for about 8 hrs so my body isn't having any more of this back to sleep stuff. It is during this time that I come to a very important discovery. My headlamp is missing! This is huge! We use our headlamps for a ton of stuff. Hiking in the morning before daylight. Hiking in the evening after sunset and setting up camp when we get there. Eating when it's dark. Answering the call of nature at night. You get the picture. I tried to think of how I could have lost it. Could it have dropped out of an open pocket at break time? Maybe it fell out when I was pulling something out of my pocket. Or perhaps it fell out in the trunk of my brother Denny'car on the ride to the approach trail. Rats, no sense wondering too much, it was truly gone!I should have realized right then and there what kind of a day this was going to be. After we finally did get up and start heading toward the trail my hiking pole broke off at the jount! I have used hiking poles for probably over 10,000 miles. Normally I buy the Leki Super Makalus. They are an awesome pole and very hardy. But last time I replaced my poles I got a ' flip-lock' version. Oh, they are still Leki's but a complete failure as a piece of equipment. My first pair did the same thing about a week into my GDT hike. I was hopping mad but the poles couldn't be replaced since I was in Canada. When we got home from that trip, I sent them back and received a replacement pair. The pole that broke this morning was that replacement pair! I haven't even had them four months. This is totally unacceptable. Leki, I used to be a huge fan, but now, not so much.The rest of the days hike went pretty well A lot of uphill. We are in the mountains but Will said today they seem more like hills. I guess compared to the Sierras. But if you put enough hills together it still is a honking huge amount of uphill. I texted my brother and asked him to look in his trunk for my headlamp. Sure enough it was there. At least I know where it is now and that I didn't lose it. First day on the AT and it looks like I'll be buying a headlamp and a pair of poles. Sheesh! Oh well, small things in the big picture I guess. Well. I'm going to sign off for now.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522486,"Last night as we were setting up camp a fellow hiker came in who had a beautiful husky for a companion. This morning as we were breaking camp in the dark, the husky came over to greet us. It was very friendly and playful.Around midnight the wind really picked up and started to howl. There was an owi that seranaded us throughout the night. Whoooo whooo whoo. We got an early start and made the climb up Blood Mountain. There was a beautiful sunrise with a blood red sky. It was cold and the wind was blowing hard. The descent from the top of Blood Mountain was steep in places along rocky terrain. We made it to Neel gap and Mountain crossing where we picked up a small resupply. Annie bought a new set of trekking poles and a headlight. Outside of the outfitters there is a tree full of shoes. These are shoes which hikers have left behind after the first 30 miles because they had problems with their feet. The outfitter was well equipped and quite helpful. They had everything we needed. We climbed from the gap and spent most of our day climbing from gap to gap along the ridges. The trees are bare so we had some unobstructed views of the distant ridges and mountains. It was another beautiful sunny day with blue sky. The sky was cloudless. By afternoon we were down to our shirt sleeves and sweating in the midday sun.It seems like we spend most of our time either climbing or descending. There have not been a whole lot of flat spots. And for some reason it always seems like the the descents are always shorter than the climbs.We picked up some water at Low Gap shelter and climbed up and over to Chattahoochee gap. We have a nice flat spot out of the wind and have called it a day.Today we met several thruhikers along the way including Zach from Indiana, Quicksand and another fellow Arizoner from the Scottsdale area.Tomorrow we may get some late afternoon rain.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522215,"I gotta tell you, the stars were amazing last night. With no artificial lights around to fade them out, they were brilliant! We started out in our our headlamps this morning (thankfully I had my new one). So we decided to stretch our legs on a trail going north before we started our real hike today on AT. If you believe that I've got a bridge in San Francisco I'd like to sell you! There are times when I think about omitting a few things in our journal that would make me look bad but it wouldn't really be a true picture of our hike. So what really happened this morning is that we missed the trail and hiked for about an hour round trip on the wrong trail. We just kept trying to convince ourselves that we were on the AT, but finally we had to admit we were on a side trail. We made our way back to Chattahoochee Gap and started over. What started out as a 5:50am start time ended up as a 7am start. We had to rearrange our mindset because it is what it is.I think Chattahoochee is a fun name. And in Georgia it is used to name a whole bunch of things. For example, the gap we left this morning, a forest sytem, a river, fire stations erc. As soon as I heard this name a song popped up. ""Way down yonder in the Chattahoochee, it gets hotter than a hoochee koochee"", Do you know it? It's an old song. Yeah, kind of fun to sing the first 15 or 20 times but I got stuck singing it in a loop in my head, after the millionth time it's not as fun, believe me.We passed one of the many shelters on the trail this morning and stopped to get some water.   I took off my pack and set it down. Low and behold, there was a question mark in sweat on it. I took a picture for you. But that got me wondering. What is the question that my pack wanted me to answer? I have already answered the question of why I hike so that can't be it. Why is there something instead of nothing? Well, I believe in a personal Creator God, so that answers that one for me. Did Oswald kill Kennedy or was it really black ops for the government because of his stance in Cuba? I don't know the answer to that one but you gotta wonder why my backpack would want to know that in the first place. Whatever the question was, it gave me something to think about as I walked down the trail.I have to admit, the trail kicked our butt today. We ended up doing like 5,000 feet of elevation gain. And though we hiked about 24 miles because of our little glitch this morning, only 22 were AT miles. But thankfully, there was the downhill. And that's the reason for today's title. I got the trail name Road Runner from Three Cats on the PCT in 2013 for a leg release thing I do on the downhill. I need a long smooth graded decline to do it and today I had it. Yippee! We reached Dick's Creek Gap but still had another .5 mile to get to the Top of Georgia Hostel where we had shipped a resupply package. What a warm and friendly welcome we received.   Today was the 2nd birthday for the hostel. We hadn't really decided if we wanted to stay or go into town, but once we got here and looked around we knew this was the place for our weary hiker bodies. Definitely recommend this hostel if you are hiking through. And now, I've had a shower, my clothes are clean and supper has been eaten.

While we sat on the side of the trail huddled in a nook,a bitter cold wind came a blowing in. Soon the rains followed. We got to try out our new cuben fiber pack cover and rain gear.   So far, so good. We stayed dry and warm for the remainder of our hiking day.We hadn'the planned on staying at the hostel. We are just kind of winging it right now. We had a small resupply box at the hostel. With the rain moving in, along with the darkness, we decided to stay at the hostel and it turned out to be a good choice. We got the last two bunks.Bob/SirPacksaLot runs a tight ship. We got to meet several other thruhikers. A special thanks to Richard who gave us a package oof potatoes and his homemade beef jerky.We got a late start today and we were climbing from the gitgo. My legs were dragging from the start and I have had the big burn going on the ascents. Today turned into a major trudge. I just couldn't get anything going in the energy department. So it would be trudge, Annie's stops and waits, trudge some more, Annie's stops and waits. 'Hey do you need a breath break?' Sure why not. Today I was the ball and chain on our little hiking adventure.We passed from Georgia into North Carolina. I've heard that something like 25-30% of thruhikers heading northbound don't make it out of Georgia. I can certainly understand. Combine some inexperience, a heavy load with the relentless climbing and it all adds up to tough times on the AT. We didn't do much celebrating as we climbed into NC but we were struck by the beauty of the hoarfrost that stuck to the trees and covered the whole mountainside for as far as we could see.Today was a tough day for layering. I don't know if you have had one of those days where you just can't get it right.   We were in and out of the wind, the sun and the shade and we were either too hot or too cold. We eventually descended down to Deep Gap and decided to call it a day.   We had a good climb up ahead out of the gap and my legs were shot. In addition it is supposed to get very cold tonight, somewhere in the mid twenties. Those kind of temps will definitely test our gear. We are hoping that the lower elevation at the gap may help.I know that from previous hikes that days three and four are usually some of my toughest.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522482,"This year we chose to start our hike in the winter. There were several different reasons for that I won't go into right now. But I've got to say, so far it's been gloriously beautiful. Pretty much.   I mean sunny and getting up into the 60 's. We did have a little rain on Tuesday. But yesterday felt more like winter. The wind was pushy and we had to hike in more layers to stay warm.It's amazing to me how much technology has affected the long distance hike. Yesterday I saw a guy on the top of a mountain using a cell phone. He was probably talking with the wife. This would have been unheard of in the past . You would have had to carry a satellite phone for emergencies. And then it would have cost you an arm and a leg to use it. We now have trail apps which have everything you want to know about your journey. Maps, way points, elevation, distance hiked, GPS of where you are at all times. You name it. Just give them a few years, it will be able to pick you up and carry you to your destination!! We also have a weather app on our phone specificly for the trail. It tells you the current weather and the forecast along points of the trail. It even adjusts for the elevation.And it's been fairly accurate.   So when it said it was going down to 15 degrees last night we took it seriously. We put on every bit of clothing we brought with us. Including our winter gear. But we froze anyway.. Ha! Just kidding. No, we actually stayed pretty toasty. And according to our app, the nicer weather is supposed to return. Yay!Well, so much for trusting the weatherman! My 'yay!' would soon turn into 'dashing through the snow'. The first part of the day was cold but tolerable. We saw some really cool crystalline frost formations on the ground. Some of them were super long and looked sort of like bear fur. I took a picture but wasn't sure it turned out that well. We came upon a second one that was super beautiful. It was fixed to a moss covered rock. I carefully removed a twig that was in front of it to get a better picture. There was a vine on the formation too. But just as I was saying 'I better not move that one it looks connected', Will reached down and pulled on it. The whole thing just collapsed! Oh well. But as I was walking down the trail stepping on the rocks underfoot, it occurred to me that some relationships are like the rocks I was stepping on, hard and tough, enduring through the years. And some relationships are like frost. They seem beautiful but they crumble at the merest touch.As we sat down to eat lunch, it started to snow! Hey! What happened to that sunny and mid 60's forecast? Ah well, when one is hiking a winter through hike a little snow should not be a surprise right? It actually turned out to be very beautiful. It clung to the trees turning them into a winter wonderland. The roots and logs were a bit dangerous though. But, it gave us a chance to try out our winter-rain-snow gear. And I'm happy to report it did very well. We planned to let the day unfold and see where it got us. Hoping to make it into Franklin. But as the snow started piling up, Will said that Franklin was now the destination. Long mileage day but we started early as usual and came out on the road by about 5:30pm. The 2nd car going our way picked us up. Hallelujah! Super nice guy who drove all the way to the Budget Inn and then stuck around to see if we could get a room or if we needed him to drive us somewhere else.

Most town zeros are the same. Eat, sleep, resupply and do the chores necessary to get back on trail.I have had two major screw ups so far. Annie told you about the first one. I was in the lead coming out of Chattahoochee Gap in the dark and instead of hitting the AT, which went east, I got us going north on a blue blazed side trail. It is always frustrating having to backtrack. The second screw up was much worse. I lost a piece of essential equipment. We use two rubber straps that cinch our trekking poles together. The poles form the center piece of our pyramid tent. I lost the straps. At Deep Gap we made do with a long stick. So even though initially we hadn't planned on going into Franklin, now it became a necessity. We had to try and figure a way to Jimmy something together until I could get an order in for some new straps.Yesterday was an interesting day. I was really able to enjoy the hike. My legs were strong on the climbs. It gives one a sense of gliding down the trail. We could tell from the start that we were in for some nasty weather as the skies darkened. We had stopped for lunch just below the lookout on Albert Mountain when it started to snow. By the time we started our ascent, the ground was covered. It made for some great hiking as the wind swirled and whipped the snow all around us. What was great was that we knew that we wouldn' have to sleep in the snow. A warm and dry room in Franklin was in the cards.We saw a few other hikers on our way in. Some were heading for the shelters and others were catching a shuttle at Rock Gap. The shuttle was tempting. But we stuck it out the last 3.7 miles where we bumped into a couple of twenty somethings who were headed south hiking through the storm in their shorts. Ah youth!!!Just a quick word on equipment. My new Arc'teryx rain jacket which is Goretex trilaminate was bombproof. I was completely dry on the inside. That is the first time that I have hiked through rain or snow for an extended period of time and remained completely dry. So that gives me some confidence in heading up the trail.The second piece of equipment which also performed admirably was a pair of North Face Montana Mittens. My hands stayed warm the whole way. These look like those mittens that snowboarders use. I have big time trouble keeping my hands and feet warm in the colder weather.As far as RR goes she was cruising along right behind me singing up a storm.We have more food on deck for tonight. Then we'll enjoy a good night sleep in our soft and warm beds and then get back after it in the morning.   55 miles to Fontana Village Resort, our next major stop.

I like my town and rest stops don't get me wrong but my feet start getting itchy for the trail in short order so this morning when we got here it felt sort of like coming home.Sometimes as hikers we joke about being homeless when we are on the trail doing a long hike. Everything we own for that hike is on our back. We sleep on the ground. We are dirty and pretty unkempt. We don't really smell that well after several days on the trail. When we get to town we have a raging hunger and we stuff vast amounts of food in our faces like a skinny stray dog. I think the town people are unable to tell the difference between us and the real homeless people.   We talked to a hiker who went into a Subway all skinny and dirty and was wolfing down some food. As a fellow diner walked by him the man surreptitiously laid a $5.00 bill next to the hiker. He thought he was homeless!Yeah, we make jokes at our own expense and we think it's funny. But yesterday morning as I made my way to the gas station to scope it out, all clean and somewhat groomed, I came across a 'real' homeless woman. She had the requisite shopping cart. Everything she owned was in that cart. She had some plastic to cover her belongings against the rain and snow. And I have to tell you it pulled me up short. I don't know if she had to sleep out in that cold, wet, snowy night but you can bet she didn't have as good of 'camping ' equipment as I do. I was able to duck into a hotel take a shower and stay warm. I don't know if she did. Real homelessness is certainly no joke. And while our kidding around and poking fun at ourselves was by no means a slur on the very real problem and plight of the true homeless persons reality, it still was very sobering to think of her out in these winter conditions. Let's be clear here. I am in no no way making fun of the homeless community. Any reference to a 'joke' was pointed at myself as a wayfaring long distance hiker. In fact, just the opposite. Having been out in the harsh winter conditions, it made her plight all the more ghastly to me.When I am at home, I am involved in the Youth Group at my church. This summer they are going on a mission trip to California to minister to a huge homeless population there. I am so proud of them for being willing to think of others so much less fortunate than they are and to put these people's needs first. Very cool!Today started out very sunny. We were climbing from the gitgo but that is pretty usual coming out of a Gap. Our town stay was successful. We got a lot of chores done but we also had ample time to rest. We were on trail about 8:30am which is 2.5 hours later than usual. But of course we wanted to get as close to our projected daily mileage as possible. We decided to give it a go. As we were hiking along we suddenly bumped into a cool sign that said "" Trail Magic Today"" Are you kidding me? Hot darn, our first trail magic on the Appalachian Trail! How cool is that!? It turned out to be two people being magical. Even better. Trail Chef was the first to greet us and offer us all sorts of wonderful things to eat. Including some home made chili to warm us up. There were even some chairs to sit in and take a load off. A few hikers were the before us and we chatted with them in the hiker talk language. But all too soon Will was tapping me on the shoulder and telling me it was time to head on down the trail. A big thank you again to all of those trail angels that gave up their Saturday to bring some food and joy into our hiker day!And then it was back to the uphill. We hiked until we got to Tellico Gap where we have hunkered down. Again we have put everything on in the way of clothing. There were snow flakes in the air and it looks to be a very cold one tonight.

It helps to know that soon after we start climbing that I will be warm and shedding layers.There are two times of the hiking day that are really enjoyable: early morning and late afternoon. The light has a different quality. This morning as we climbed above Tellico Gap, it wasn't long before the first rays of light began appearing in the east. We shut off our headlamps and we walked toward the light or into the light. The birds were singing. Why were the birds singing? Who knows. Maybe that is just their nature to sing. Just like it is in our nature to walk.The birds sounded happy. I know that sounds a bit goofy. It was like they were saying to each other 'hey we are going to make it, winter is almost over'. Anyway I enjoyed their singing and it made me think about walking into the light and hopefully that is a metaphor for my life.We finished our initial climb and crested the ridge. The sun rays warmed us and for as far as we could see, there were miles of forests. At that moment I had a sense of the beauty of the AT. We had a long descent to the Nantahala Outdoor Center where we had breakfast and then began our steep climb out of the gorge.Today was climbing day. I think that we did around 5000 feet of climbing. It was a sunny spring like day. No trouble keeping warm today. From the NOC we climbed about 3500 feet until we peaked out. There were some great views from Cheoah Bald.We descended all the way back down to Stecoah Gap where we cooked dinner on a picnic table.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522760,"Apparently my fingers looked like hot dogs dangling out of my sleeping bag because a mouse ran up and bit my thumb in rapid succession last night! He didn't break the skin thankfully, but came pretty close. I have had mice chew through various parts of my pack before, but never run up and try to take a chunk out of my finger. Although there was that time when I was a young girl. I was over at my uncle Nolan's and we were playing in the garage. It was a time in my life where I was trying to pick up and cuddle all things furry. Alley cats etc., and getting bit and scratched for my troubles. On that particular day, I saw a cute little furry looking mouse just asking to be picked up. Somehow I got it cornered in the garage. But when I started to pick it up, it bit me! Of course instead of getting sympathy from my elders I got yelled at for trying to pick up a mouse in the first place. I can't remember if there was a tetanus shot involved. But this morning I didn't want to pick up the little mouse and cuddle it. I wanted to kill it with my shoe!I don't think either Will or I slept very well after that. We kept waiting for the devil mouse to come out and bite us in the nose or something. We were on the trail by 6am again this morning. Regardless of how much (or little) sleep we got. We were a mere 13.5 miles from Fontana Dam and hoping to make it there by 12:30 or so. The plan is to get a room at the Resort. Making today a nero. Then 'sleep in' tomorrow, heading back to the trail at around 12:00. Making that our second nero.Had some good views of the Fontana Dam as we got closer to the village. I tried to take a couple pictures for you but the trees were blocking the view. And though I asked them politely to move, they steadfastly refused to do so. Trees can be very stubborn I'm finding. So pretty much right on schedule, we made it to the shuttle pick up place at 11:45am. There was some lag time but we got a room and picked up our food boxes that we sent ourselves here . A huge lunch came next and showers and the laundry.   Hoping to get some down time to just chill after that.We met a couple of hikers that I thought especially my youth group teens would be interested in. Their trail names are Kid and Pork Roll. They are from PA and NJ. They are 19 and 18 years old and plan to hike the entire Appalachian Trail. Some 2190 miles (depending on whose stat you are reading). The guys are super strong hikers and impressed both Will and I, which is saying a lot with all the trails we have under our belt. I would be very surprised if these guys didn't make it. So see, you guys? It's not just people in my age bracket doing this hike but also teenagers. Very cool. Well, I guess that's a wrap for today. Heading into the Smokies tomorrow. We'll let you know how that goes! Road Runner","Near Sweetwater Gap

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523432,We had a restful stay at the Fontana Village Resort. Nice rooms for a decent price.   Hiker friendly. Highly recommended if you can afford the $77. We got a ride to the post office from HikerHunter. He is a section hiker from Texas. Many thanks.We hit the trail around 1 PM with heavy packs. The trail goes by the Fontana 'Hilton'. This is reportedly one of the nicer shelters along the trail complete with electric outlets to recharge phones and devices and best of all showers. We hit the pavement that took us over Fontana Dam.Soon we were back in the woods to begin a long hot sweaty slog up to Mollie's Ridge. Temps were in the 70s. We went through our fluids rapidly. We climbed and climbed and finally reached the shelter just as it was getting darkCheerio built a fire. I enjoyed our first campfire. There were two college age girls from Vanderbilt who were out for a few days of hiking in the Smokies for Spring break. HoHo a young thruhiker from San Diego joined us. He hiked the PCT in 2015 and got bit with the thruhiker bug. Here he is on the AT with big plans for future hikes. It was a really enjoyable night.I was reflecting on how a thruhike changes a person. One sees the world in a completely different manner after walking 2000 miles. Someone can start out a hike as a member of the corporate world and end up a vagabondWill,"Fontana Dam

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522868,"Did you know that you can get poison ivy in the winter? Me neither, but apparently it's true because I picked it up a little less than a week ago. Of course since all the leaves are off and only the vines are present, it looks like every other barren viney stick out there. Will didn't get it. Just me. I have had poison ivy several different times now and it seems like I react more violently each time I get it. Oh well, I guess you could call it a 'trail hazard '.The wind was very exuberant last night. It spoke in a kind of gusty way. If I closed my eyes as I sat in the tent, I could picture myself on the deck of an old sailing ship. The sails straining as the wind drove the ship forward and waves breaking in high waves all around me. But then I opened my eyes and I was in a forest surrounded by trees. But the wind was still there, and it acted the part of one of those ' white noise' machines through out the night.We stayed at Mollies shelter last night which is kind of fun because my friend Lynne has a German Shepherd puppy named Molly. You can see her in our very first prep page that Will wrote pretending to be our dog Jedi. She is so cute.When you are in the Smokey Mountain National Park, you forced to stay at the shelters or pay a fine if you are caught. The caveat is that if the shelter you go to is full then you don't have to stay. This is the first shelter we have stayed at on our trip so far. There are a lot of reasons for that but one of the biggies is that it cramps our mileage style. We don't want to hike 8 or 16 miles, we want to hike and average of 21.5 miles. Haven't really seen any shelters around then.We had a really gorgeous sun rise this morning which we tried to capture on the camera but those darn trees got in the way again. I'm sure you'll be surprised to hear that our hike today consisted almost exclusively of steep uphills. We had a couple of almost views thrown in there too. You really have to like trees to enjoy this hike so it's a good thing I do. Cause they're everywhere!Okay, that about does it for today. I'll catch you later! Road Runner","Mollies Ridge.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523468,"It has been a blustery couple of days. Last night the wind howled but we stayed warm and had a good night sleep.   I was talking with HoHo and we both decided that Double Gap wouldn't be a good place to be in a winter storm. The morning started out misty and foggy. We climbed the 3 miles up to Clingman's Dome, the high point of the AT.   We had no views. But we did note a major change as the forest was filled with Pines and Balsam fir. Ah, the smell of Christmas.The north side of the dome was more like a rainforest with plenty of moisture. The trail was icy and in spots treacherous for over a mile. We had a few spills and thrills, flips and slips but we made it through with our hiking poles.   Microspikes would have been nice. No blood or broken bones, just a few scrapes and bruises.We hit New Found Gap and the sun came out for the remainder of the day. So we had two completely different days in one. We had some patchy ice and snow on the way to the shelter but no major mishaps.We put in a long day and arrived at TriCorner at dark. We ate in the dark. We got the last two spots. HoHo, Rambo, Rocket, Polk Roll and Kid were all there. As the last headlamp went out, the Snorechestra started to play in a clamorous cacophony that terrified even the mice. It was a mice free night and the sleeping wasn't half bad.Will","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523212,"Last night we stayed at the Tri Corner Shelter. There were ten or eleven of us. All boys except for me. I counted at least 5 different pitches of people snoring at any given time. Needless to say it wasn't one of my soundest nights for sleeping.   This morning as we were all gathering our equipment to go and eating our breakfast, I asked the boys jokingly if they'd ever heard of the ' House of Horrors'? They said yeah. I said, we'll I'm naming the Tri Corner Shelter the 'House of Snorers!' You guys snore like Banshees! They laughed. As we were hiking down the trail I had an idea. In 2006 before we hiked the PCT I read a book by John Steinbeck. It's called 'Travels with Charlie. This is a great book. John decides to travel across America with a pickup truck and a camper and put his finger on the pulse of people as he goes and see what they are feeling and believing.   He takes his dog, Charlie. There are many things he says in this book that can apply to a long distance hike. One of my favorites is 'we find that after years of struggle, you don't take a trip, the trip takes you.' I have found that to be very true. No matter how many hours you may spend planning your hike, something unexpected seems to pop up and change everything.    The second quote I like is ,'I saw in their eyes something I was to see over and over in every part of the nation--a burning desire to go, to move, to get under way, anyplace, away from any here... nearly every American hungers to move.' I think I could say this is true of most through hikers I have met. So anyway, this gave me an idea! I could write a book and call it ' Travels with Will '! It would be all about my various backpacking adventures with Will through the years. And we have had quite a few. We've seen some amazing views throughout America and Canada, had various close calls and near misses on the trail. Seen a pretty vast array of wild animals from grizzly bears to black wolves. And every time we have ventured out we have returned changed in some tangible way. I think I totally have enough material for a book. But I'm just kidding with you, I'm not planning on writing a book. The 4 or 5 of us that would want to read it wouldn't be enough for the printing cost. Lol. I think I just liked the spin off sound of the title, ' Travels with Will '.All book ideas aside, we had about 18 miles to make it to Standing Bear Farms where we had sent a small resupply box. I must say, that I think Will has done a really fine job keeping our resupply spots short so that we only need to carry a couple of days of food at a time. This keeps our pack weight down. My back thanks him as I hike up all this uphill. If our hike going into Top of the Mountain Georgia was a 'Road Runner kind ofor day' I'm not sure what I would call today. Huge amounts of gradient downhill that had my feet pretty much flying. We had one small glitch with our AWOL directions when it came to making the turn off to Standing Bear. But we just called them and got it clarified. We reached the Farm in the early afternoon. Picked up our package, bought a little supplemental food from their really great on site store, chatted with some hiker friends for a bit and then moved on. We still had another 4 miles to make our daily average goal that we set for ourselves. Standing Bear is a work in progress. They are in the process of upgrading and improving the farm complex. But even as it stands now, this was a great little stop. It's right on trail and it allowed to keep our food weight down by holding a package. It gets the Team Tyler seal of approval. Well, we've found a great little camp site and we are ready to hunker down for the night. Catch you later! Road Runner","Tri Corner Shelter

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523746,"We had a great campsite last night. Quiet. We watched the last golden rays of the sun fall on the knob and then it was off to zzzland. We got a good start this morning and hiked up to the grassy bald at Snowbird Mt. We were glad we didn't choose to hike on and camp there last night. The wind was howling. We were relatively sheltered from the wind at our site.We dropped down to the side trail to Ground Hog shelter. Shortly after passing the shelter, we stopped for a break and here came a hiker with his music player blaring some heavy metal. No earbuds. Maybe he was trying to teach the birds a few new songs.Later we met Subman and Suds and got to chat for a few moments. I had been reading their journal before we got on trail.. We hooked up again for a picture later in the day at Max Patch. Subman is an AT thruhiker veteran. He hiked the trail in 2003. This is Suds first go round and she seems to being doing well aside from some foot problems. Enjoyed meeting them and wish we had more time to hang out.We climbed to SR 1182, picked up some water at the stream and then climbed up to Max Patch. We had 360 panoramic views from the bald. We could see the surrounding mountains for miles and miles. Ridge upon ridge. It was nice to have some unobstructed views. It was the highlight of the day.The next few miles was fairly easy downhill hiking to Lemon Gap. Then it was up and down for another 1800 feet of climbing to Bluff Mt. We ran into Rambo at the Walnut Mt shelter. We hiked together for a short time. We crested the high point and cruised down to our campsite on an old road bed where we have a secluded flat spot.Dinner tonight is broccoli cheddar rice with some cheese and summer sausage mixed in. Pretty good. Snickers for dessert.We have our first mini crisis of the trip. RR has developed a severe contact dermatitis probably in reaction to poison ivy. It looks like it may be getting infected. I tend to think in worst case scenarios. We are 8 miles from Hot Springs which has a medical clinic. Unfortunately it is closed on Sunday. This leaves us the option of hiking on to Erwin Tn which is another 3 days away. Not an option. This could get out of control.So I think our best option will be to try and hitch a ride into one of the surrounding towns so that RR can have her arm evaluated and get some medications and a decision can be made whether we can safely head up the trail. Antibiotics and steroids may be the answer. The alternative, we may have to get off trail for awhile. Stay tunedWill","N of Spanish Oak Gap

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523467,"When we last saw our heroine, she had a pretty nasty case of poison ivy but was bravely hiking down the Appalachian Trail.   Now, days later, her condition has worsened precipitously and her retired husband the Physician is threatening to pull her off the trail. Warning her that if this continues, she may need to be hospitalized! Lol, I do get a big kick out of keeping this journal. But all kidding aside, my arm was really good looking nasty. It was hurting like the dickens, beside the itching, and had turned very red and super oozy. I have another picture but Will says it's disgusting. So I won't display it for the sake of the children. I gotta tell you when he started talking about the possibility of ending our hike over it, it made me pretty sad. I'm a ' the glass is half full' kind of girl usually but in this case the glass wasn't half empty or half full, it was bone dry!We had just 8 miles to make it to Hot Springs this morning. We talked about all different scenarios. Today is Sunday and we knew the Hot Springs Urgi Center was closed. We could try and hitch to Ashville,NC or maybe throw ourselves on the mercy of my brother Denny who lives like 3 hours away. I knew he would help me in a heartbeat but a 6 hrs round trip seemed a little extreme. We decided to figure it out when we got there. The 8 miles just flew by and we came down off the trail at little after 9am. We looked around and there it was, the Laughing Heart Hostel.This had to be an omen right? My heart could use some laughter and all we have to do is walk about 15 or 20 steps and we are there. This we do and we are met as we walk in the door by two Trail Angels extraordinaire, Brave and Forward. They are on a little trail angeling road trip and had pulled into the Laughing Heat Hostel this am. Fortunately for us as it turns out. We asked about nearby Urgi Care places. They asked us why and when I showed them, they immediately dropped all their own personal plans and started making a plan to take us to Ashville, NC to an Urgi Care place.   From Hot Springs this is probably about an 45 minute drive. We took our showers and we're soon on the way.Ended up in a CVS of all places. Had their own little clinic with a nurse practitioner. She was really good. Took about 45 minutes going over my case and answering our questions.   Turns out she was the woman to see since she treats tons of cases similar to mine in the summer. This made Will feel a bit better because he was worried I was working my way to a very severe infection that might need IV care or something. She didn't even recommend that I stop hiking. Wahooo! She said the steroids would take care of it.We left the clinic with a few prescriptions and feeling much better. Brave and Forward were waiting patiently outside for us. They were very happy that we had gotten the help we needed. Then it was on to the store. They needed a few things and we needed to resupply so that worked out well.We headed back to the Laughing Heart Hostel, and indeed my heart felt some laughter now. We are so, so grateful to Brave and Forward for ditching the plans they had for their whole day and taking pity on their fellow hikers. You guys will never know how much that meant to us! Again, thank you from the bottom of our laughing hearts!Road Runner","North of Big Rock Springs

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523806,"I'd like to start by saying we had a great stay at Laughing Heart Hostel. Annie filled you in on the details of our day and the kindness of Forward and Brave. Once again, a big thank you. We highly recommend the hostel. By the time we got back to town it was late in the hiking day, so we decided to stay at the hostel and resume our hike in the morning.But first I had to get down to the outfitter to see if they could repair my trekking poles. I had cobbled together a pair of old Leki Super Makalus but after about 250 miles the locking system was no longer working on either pole. We stopped at Bluff Mountain Outfitters and picked up a few supplies while they worked on my poles. I was totally blown away. They basically gave me two new bottom pole sections on both poles. Unbelievably at no charge. Nada. No labor, no parts. Where do you find service like that. Only in Hot springs NC. Highly recommedn Bluff Mt Outfitters. They also have a nice natural food section in their store.Next it was on to Iron Horse Tavern where we each got a half pound Angus burger and I got to watch the final five minutes of the Big 10/14 championship which my team, the MSU Spartans held on to beat a tough Purdue team. Let March Madness begin.We walked through town in the early morning darkness and began a long day of climbing. I can't say that there was anything unique about our day. It was just like all of our other days so far. We climbed and then we went down and then we climbed some more. We did have some rain midafternoon, so we got out our rain gear and pack covers and hiked on to Little Laurel shelter where a group of thruhikers were congregating. Speedy Gonzalez and Medic both from Jacksonville Florida were there. Later Scorched Heels came rolling in. His trail name means just what it says. He hiked his first four days in ill fitting shoes and ended up with holes in his heels. He is obviously better now. We have seen SH several times along the trail. He is young and fast. The most memorable time was near Mt Albert where he blew by us in a snowstorm on the way to a shelter but not without first thanking us for laying down fresh tracks in the snow. Otherwise he told us he would have gone the wrong way. Glad to be of some help.Well wrong way Riegels might be a good trail name for SH because the next morning leaving the shelter he got disoriented and hiked the 3 1/2 miles back to Mt Albert before recognizing he was going wrong way southbound. So he walked an extra 7 miles that day. I don't know but if that had been me, I would have had serious thoughts about quitting then and there. Tough kid though, he ended up hiking 25 miles that day.We headed out from the shelter and got stuck on a ridge near Whiterock cliffs. We have found a little nook in the trees which will have to do because it is getting dark. We have kind of jerryrigged our tent tying it to a few trees; as long as the winds don't blow too hard we should be good for the night. We are in the midst of our first thunderstorm. The lightning is crashing and flashing overhead and the thunder is rumbling over the cliffs and canyon. I'm just going to bury my head in my sleeping bag like a little kid hiding under his bed from the bogeyman and hope that I wake up in the morning. The rain is pelting down on our tent. But we are dry and warm. Pleasant dreamsWill","Hot Springs, NC

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523725,"Have you ever asked someone a question and had them reply, 'I don't have the foggiest idea'? Well this morning I experienced what they might alluding to in a very real and tangible way. We woke up to some pretty dense fog outside our tent. And combined with the fact that we were hiking in the dark in our headlamps this made for some challenging hiking let me tell you.And like the person who doesn't have the foggiest idea how to answer your question, there were a few times I didn't have the foggiest idea where we were going, literally.   We hiked for a little while and we're given the choice between the scenic rocky rim trail or the dangerous weather by pass. Ya think? Hmmm, let's see, go on the scenic trail in the foggy dark when you won't be able to see anything anyway but could possibly pitch yourself over the side of a cliff OR take a trail named dangerous weather bypass when the weather is dangerous.   You'll be relieved to know we went with option two.By and by the fog lifted and the sun began to make its appearance. Right before full light I heard an owl calling out to me. This reminded me of our friend Jeff, aka Elavator aka Hootie. And I smiled because I know he is hiking along with us in spirit. It also made me think of the book, ' I heard the Owl Call my Name' . I'm pretty sure this owl called me Road Runner. We decided we'd like to try and make it to Erwin in three days. That means an average of 23 miles a day. We had a bunch of uphill of course, but also a fair amount of downhill with a comfortable amount of traversing thrown in for good measure.   The tread was soft and fairly clear of rocks and roots for a change. We decided to try and hike a little later tonight. We ate dinner at our last break and then kept on hiking. A little after 7pm we called it a day and discovered that we had put in our longest day so far on the Appalachian Trail I do believe. This sets us up for a little bit shorter day of hiking tomorrow. We are both really looking forward to a rest day.But for now we are camped midway down this nice bowl. I'm plumb tuckered out so I will bid you a fond good night. Road Runner","Near Whiterock Cliffs

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523839,"An easy day on the AT? Nah, not really. Maybe an easier day than the others but we were still working up a pretty good sweat and my legs were burning on the uphills.We started south of Big Bald and as we climbed up and around the bald we were treated to a nice sunrise. But that was it for the morning as the clouds moved in and it started to rain. We warded off the rain spirit by donning our rain gear and putting on our pack covers. As soon as we were decked out the rain stopped and soon we were hiking in the sunshine.It was a beautiful sunny warm day. Our afternoons have been really warm lately. It is as if we have decided to skip spring and move into summer. But the trees are still bare and except for a few wild daffodils and dandelions, there hasn't been much activity in the flora department.Annie and I were talking about how it seems like we have been on the trail for a long time even though it has been only a little over two weeks. We climbed about 3500 feet today and so far on the AT that amounts to an easier day. We bumped into Firefly, a veteran AT thruhiker who was out today painting fresh white blazes. We both feel that out of all the hikes that we have done that the AT is the best maintained trail. Incredible work by all the volunteers from Georgia to Maine. We stopped for lunch near No Business Knob shelter and then it was a long downhill cruise into Irwin.We picked up some fuel at Uncle Johnny's and they gave us a shuttle ride to the Super 8 for $6.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523800,"It's funny, as much as I love to long distance hike, I also look forward to the true rest day or Zero day. That's zero in terms of no trail miles hiked. Although that is not quite true at the town stops, for example in a town like Erwin, which is very spread out, we walked a little over two miles last night to get our laundry done and pick up some pizza and probably about the same today eating and getting some groceries. But, the terrain is vastly different, mostly on the flat which is huge in terms of wear on hiker.So, for the couple of days before you get to this trail town you're thinking about what food you're going to get to eat, how good that shower is going to feel. How nice it will be to have clean clothes on and not stink for at least a day, how wonderful it will be to sleep in a nice soft bed and not have to worry about getting rained on....Yes, it's kind of funny, because before you hit the long trail you just wanted to leave all of civilization behind and go out and be one with nature and eat granola. I think Thoreau had some pithy sayings about not wanting what we have, or having what we want, but I can't call them to mind right now.But what I can tell you is that Will and I really needed this rest day. The bout with the poison ivy really took a lot out of me as well as pushing those uphill miles. But today is a rest day, yay! So we are organizing our town tasks to take up as little time as possible that we might be able to just chill and reconnect with friends and family. I was able to talk to my sister Brenda, my friend Lynne and my daughter Wendy which was so nice and it felt restful too.Oh, and while we were out and and about I saw this Road Runner gas station. I guess they are a chain. Who knew? I have at least 140 stores named after me because this one was store #140. Lol. Well, I guess that's about it. I think I'll get back to enjoying my rest day.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524554,"We had a restful stay at the Super 8. It was quiet, clean with soft beds and a computer for use in the lobby. We met one other thruhiker there. Papa Monkey was on his way out as we were coming in. It was about a half mile walk to the post office, a mile to the grocery and a bit further to the laundromat.I actually enjoyed the walk. It was nice walking on flat ground not having to worry about tree roots and rocks hidden under the dead leaves on trail. When I told Annie that I enjoyed the walk, she was a bit incredulous but it almost acted as a massage for my tired legs.We met a few hikers today that stayed at Uncle Johnny's. They said that it got a bit raucous. So if you are looking to socialize and party a bit, Uncle Johnny's may be right for you. If you are looking for rest and quiet, we recommend the Super 8.We got aa ride back to trail with Tom from Hiker's Shuttle for $7. A good deal.   He has hiked the AT and PCT. He picked us up right on time at 6:30. Typically when leaving town or a gap we have had a steep climb but at least for a few miles today the trail was a bit more forgiving as we hiked along the Jones Branch of the Nolichucky river. It was pretty much flat.We eventually started our climb from the river bed and hiked through dense forest. Brother Tom from Glenmary Missions had set up his truck with goodies for hikers. He was out providing hospitality and kindness. Between the two of us, Annie and I had some banana nut bread, a brownie, lemonade and an apple and an orange. Thanks Brother Tom.It was sunny and warm with blue sky all day. I hiked in a short sleeve shirts and shorts. We are now about three weeks into our hike and based on past hikes, this is when we start to get trail tough. For me the most noticeable change today was that I could hike the climbs all day long without my quads burning. Nothing better for a hiker than to have their legs. I felt strong all day and I had a feeling of gliding along the trail. A sense of effortlessness.We peaked out at over 5000 feet at Unaka Mt. There was a nice stand of Spruce and Fir in this area. Nice to have a change of scenery. From Unaka Mt we spent the rest of the afternoon undulating along the ridgeline. We cruised into Greasy Creek Gap and called it a day. We have a spring for a water source, a nice flat campsite and a beautiful sunset. Today was a great day. We couldn't have asked for more. We were rested, strong, the weather was good. In fact it was a perfect hiking day. Over the next three day the weather is supposed to take a turn for the worse. As we say along the trail, it is what it is. Hike on.Will","Erwin, Tennessee

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524341,"We left camp this morning in our headlamps about 6am as per usual from our tent site near the Grassy Creek Friendly Hostel turnoff..   We have fallen into a hiking routine of rising at 5 am and then departing as close to 6 as possible.   Since we have been hiking in winter, this means shorter days and thus the headlamp walking each day. If we put in a really long day, sometimes we start AND end our day in our headlamps. But what has been interesting to me has been that hiking in a headlamp seems to change the perception of my hike.   Well, obviously it's dark and I can't really see anything so my perception of what's out there to look at changes.   More than that though, I find myself staying in the moment of my hike more easily.   All I can see are the few feet in front of me, and so I hike those few feet without any prejudice.   I don't look forward and think ' oh great, another honkin 'huge uphill to climb!'   Or,'yay! Whoopee! I get to go downhill!'.   No, in my headlamp, I take each few feet as it comes, uphill or downhill, it doesn't matter.   In some ways it would be great if I could hike the whole trail in my headlamp. I could stay in the moment.   But I wouldn't get to see very much, so I like my hike the way it is thank you very much. Today, we are making our way to the Roan Highland Ridge. This is a favorite spot for many AT hikers as it offers one of the highest and largest views to date. Our driver out of Erwin and back to the trail wished us to say hello from him. It is a spot he loves. And when we reach it, we can see why. The top is cleared of trees and you can see for a very long 360*. Will took some pictures. Of course, just because we hit the ridge, it didn't mean we were done climbing for the day. Not only that, but rain was in the forecast for today. And it was really looking like it would oblige. We had our pack covers on but we're holding off on the raincoats. . And sure enough, as we started to climb up Hump Mountain, which is known for its many false summits by the way, true to its word, it started to rain on us. This was a cold, gusting wind kind of rain. Not very much fun, but it does make you want to hike faster, so that part's good.When we made it to the Doll Flats, we had a choice to make. Camp there, in those nice inviting looking camp sites, or do the next 2.5 miles of downhill to reach the next spot flat enough to camp. Oh, and it's still raining. Well, we were already wet anyway so we went for it.So we're here, it's just called a spring and campsite on our guide but it looks like home sweet home to me! Good night all, catch y'all later.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524575,"Today we got off to a good start. It was cold but the rain had stopped during the night. We packed up our wet tent and ground sheet and headed down toward US 19. We had a couple of shorter climbs through the wet forest. The trail was slick. Our initial destination was Upper Laurel Fork.At the fork we were going to head off trail to the Vango Abbey Memorial Hostel. We had sent a resupply package there to break up the segment from Erwin to Damasus into equal parts. We try to keep our load as light as possible. The frequent resupply help.We reached Laurel Fork before noon. We hiked by the turnoff and then retraced our steps finding the blue blazed side trail to the hostel. Unfortunately when we got to the hostel it appeared deserted. There wasn't anybody around. We waited about an hour and called but got the answering machine. We were a bit unsure as to what to do, but after considering our options we decided to hike on. The only problem was we were out of food.We consulted our hiking guide and decided that Black Bear Resort would possibly provide a resupply where we could get enough food to get us to Damascus. So the Black Bear it was.We had another 13 miles to the resort. We put RR in the lead and she put it into high gear. I was basically running the downhills to keep up with her and even then there were several points that she had to stop and wait for me.It turned into a beautiful hike. When I was in Erwin I was tempted to send out some of my winter gear to lighten my pack. The weather had been summer like. I was glad that I didn't because winter returned this afternoon with a vengeance. Yesterday's rain turned into today's snow. The large fluffy snowflakes were mesmerizing as they fell in slow motion. Soon the rhododendrons were snow covered and we were hiking through an enchanting magical winter wonderland.Hiking through the snow was made all the more enjoyable because we knew when we got to the resort we would find shelter. We need not sleep on the snow tonight. In our 400 plus miles of hiking the AT, I have come to appreciate that you are never a day or two from a bailout point if the weather turns bad.We reached the resort around 6 PM picked up a pizza for dinner. Bought some food for resupply; took a hot shower and got us a rustic cabin that kept us out of the snow and a wet damp cold night. Sometimes our trail plans don't always work out and we just have to roll with the changes. Today was one of those days. But in the end we are still heading north up the trail.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524340,"There's something that's been really bothering me that I have to talk to you about. Folks, it's a spreading evil on the AT. That's right. Some people say that the love of money is the root of all evil.   But I'm here to tell you that ROOTS are the root of all evil!   I mean it! They lurk under the multitude of leaves lying about. They are a hidden menace. And then when you least expect it, they slip you, they trip you and they try to crip you!You think I'm kidding but I'm dead serious. I've had a lot of time to think about this since roots have been among us from the very start of this trip. They've not only slipped and tripped us, they have flat out thrown us to the ground. And if that isn't evil I don't know what is. We could have been seriously injured. But fortunately, we are both okay. There, now that I've gotten that off my chest, I can tell you about my day. We left the Black Bear Resort about 7:30 am. A bit of a late start for us. The promised cold front had come in and it was bitter cold and I do mean bitter cold. The kind of cold that makes the bones in your hands and feet yell in pain. But we did choose a winter hike so there can be no whining. The first part of the day was a gentle river walk near the Laurel River. There were some interesting rock formations at the top of the ridges lining the river. Kind of reminded me of scenes from a western movie. As the trail dropped down to the river again there were some of the largest falls we have seen on this trip. The Laurel River Falls of course. We worked hard climbing uphill, but as we neared US 321 and the turnoff to Hampton we were rewarded by some great views of Watauga Lake. We had decided this morning that we would hike the first nine miles and then try and hitch into Hampton to hit the McDonalds. We were both feeling like we were in a bit of a calorie deficit from yesterdays hiking day and we thought that a trip to McDonald's would be just the ticket to fix that.We stood by the side of the road with our thumbs out as car after car blew by us. Finally a truck went by but then turned around and pulled up to us and offered us a ride. His name was Naked Face. Turns out he had hiked most of the AT in 1993. And even though he wasn't heading into Hampton, he picked us up and took us anyway. He said he knew what it was like to stand there with your thumb out.We enjoyed talking to him about his hike in '93. My favorite part of the conversation was when we asked him if he had hiked the AT and his face lit up like Christmas and he said yes, and it's the best thing I've ever done.We sure did appreciate him going out of his way to help some hungry hikers. So thanks again Naked Face! I will admit up front that we totally stuffed ourselves like little piggies at the McDonalds.   I had a quarter pounder with cheese, a Big Mac, french fries, a hot apple pie and a cup of hot chocolate. That's a lot! But we had been running higher miles on shorter rations so we felt like we needed it. After we finished our meal we waddled out to the road to try and catch a ride back to the trail.   This proved a bit harder to do but eventually a kind soul gave us a lift.Would it surprise you to know that we both were feeling a bit unwell hiking after our gluttonous fling in town? No? I didn't think so. But the hike must go on. We continued to have some really great views of Watauga Lake.   This is a huge lake and the trail winds around it quite nicely.Then it was back in forest but we stayed high on the ridge line for quite a while so that was nice. It is supposed to get super cold tonight so we looked hard to find a campsite that was sheltered from the wind.   We finally found something suitable and have hunkered down the best we can. Hopefully we will stay somewhat warm tonight.   Okay, turning in. Catch you later! Road Runner","Black Bear Resort

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524597,"Yes Virginia, we did have an easy day on the AT. Somewhat of an easy day or at least an easier day. Yay!!! The expected night of bitter cold and subfreezing temps never materialized. Another yay!!! But it was still plenty cold. We broke camp in the dark and the wind that had been so gusty the day before subsided sometime in the night. We were all layered up and it took awhile to get warm even on the climbs.Soon the early morning light was upon us as we walked the ridgeline. There is a peacefulness in the stillness of early morning. Soon the birds were chirping and we were witness to a wonderful sunrise. The sky turned from pink to orange to a brilliant red.In the south, a blood red, full moon hovered over the mountains. The full moon was so bright last night that I awoke from my slumber thinking that I had accidentally turned on my headlamp. The inside of our tent was illuminated.It was easy hiking along the ridgeline as we passed Turkeypen Gap and then Iron Mountain Shelter. We dropped down to TN 91 and entered a flat open grassy area where we stopped for a break and shed a few layers. The sun was out in full force and the much anticipated warming trend was upon us. One more yay!!!We climbed a bit in the early afternoon and met an elderly couple out for a day hike south of Low Gap. By this time I was down to a short sleeve shirt and shorts. Quite a change from the morning's cold. We hiked along undulating terrain on the ridgeline never having to do any long climbs. Just a kind of gentle up and down all day. This was by far the easiest terrain we had traversed in a day since our start at Springer Mt.We met some section hikers at Abdington Gap Shelter where we picked up some water. More easy hiking led us to he Tennessee Virginia border. We had now entered our fourth state but for the most part the topography was the same with maybe some subtle changes. The balds and open areas were a welcome sight as were the pine and fir forests. for the most part it was dense forest as far as one could see.We hiked a few more miles in the golden light of late afternoon. We were cruisin toward Damascus but decided to stop just short and enjoy the brilliant sunset and the rising full moon. We knew that it would be a warmer night so we stopped to enjoy the peacefulness of the forest. Tomorrow we will take a nero in Damascus and resupply for our next 120 mile segment. Today was very enjoyable and an easier day on the AT.Will","N of Vandeventer Shelter

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524599,"I had a very weird occurrence in the middle of the night. I'm not sure why I tell you guys all these little things, except I guess it's part of my hike as a whole entity. So last night about midnight I was jolted out of my sleep. I'm not sure exactly what happened but it seems like I must have taken a deep breath in and when I did some saliva went up by the the epiglotis and pinned it shut. Immediately I could not breathe. Believe me I was trying. No air could pass down my throat. I tried to make a breath happen but couldn't.   I reached over and tapped Will on the back. He looked toward me and sat bolt upright.   Now, can you imagine coming out of a deep sleep to find a wife who isn't breathing and is clutching at her throat to indicate the problem? Talk about a rude awakening! He assessed the situation pretty quickly for someone who had only been awake for a few seconds. He rubbed my back and told me to try and relax and in a little while it unstuck and I could breathe again.   After I stopped coughing, the first thing I said was, I feel so sorry for those people who have full on asthma attacks!You never appreciate something as simple as a breath until you can't get one. The only time I have ever had anything that was close to this experience was when I was out riding this huge gelding I used to own. He decided to roll while I was in the saddle. I was able to dismount when he dropped to the ground, but when I came up behind him to catch him when he was done, he kicked me in the chest with his steel shod hoof. He kicked me so hard that it lifted me right off the ground. It must have put my diaphragm in spasm because I couldn't breathe. I tried really hard but couldn't. I remember thinking that this is what it felt like to die. Then I started to pass out, but when I fell to the ground the spasm released and I was able to breathe again. I had a couple broken ribs, but I could breatheIt's kind of fun to wake up and know you only have a couple of miles into a rest town. We got up at our usual time and we're on trail in our headlamps about little before 6am. The walk into town was a slow leisurely downhill and we were there before we knew it. Damascus is one of the few towns that the trail runs right through the town. They have murals and sidewalk brick artwork as well as markers in the sidewalk.   We went to Cowboy's and had breakfast and then sat there and planned a bit. There are three outfitters in town, when they opened, we sauntered over there and checked them out. Then we went over to the Crazy Larry's Hostel and booked a room, and added laundry and homemade breakfast for added fees.A friend of Larry's gave us a ride to the Food Lion to resupply which was cool. We had lunch at 'Hey Joe's ' Mexican restaurant. Super good food. Dinner was at Subway. Oh, and I got a nap and read a book in there too! A pretty good nero day all in all I would say. So, I'm signing off for now. Catch you later! Road Runner","Piped Spring S of Damascus

We had a private room which was clean and quiet with a big comfortable bed. Larry did our laundry.   Total $50. A Good deal. The bathroom was big and clean. Larry got up early to cook us breakfast.   Pancakes, eggs and sausage for $7. Another   good deal.   We were out the door and on trail by 6:30. We   recommend Crazy Larry's. RR got a migraine and didn't get much sleep last night. She had a tough day but still did a good job getting us down the trail. We had some nice hiking this morning as the AT joins up with the Virginia Creeper trail for a few miles. The Creeper trail is a rails to trails path that follows a nice looking trout stream.   It was pretty flat in this section and the hiking was easy.The AT left the Creeper trail after crossing a long wooden bridge and then we began an ascent which topped out near Whitetop Mt. We haven't seen any thruhikers for the last couple of hiking days although we did bump into Patches in Damascus.Today we met a couple of guys who were out with their dogs for a day hike. Then shortly thereafter we met a mom and daughter team, Donna and Laura who were out for a 40 miles southbound section hike over spring break.   Laura is a high school senior who plans to take a year off from college to hike the Appalachian Trail.   Bravo!!The afternoon was sunny and warm.   RR wasn't feeling well so we pulled up early.   The wind has picked up but we have found a flat sheltered camp site in the trees.   Grey clouds have moved in.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525079,"It was one of those mornings that you just didn't want to get out of bed. You wanted to just keep laying there, for another hour or so...Primarily because of the rain. The weatherman predicted it and he was oh so right, dern it. The rain came gently tapping at our tent around 5:00am. Soon it was knocking and then it was downright pounding on our poor little tent. It's hard to want to jump right out of bed and get outside and going in those circumstances. Which is why we hung out in the tent for an additional forty-five minutes and let things calm down a bit.It made me think of Grandma Gatewood.   She was a fiesty older woman who hiked the AT solo back in the day when women stayed home and watched the kids and men had all the adventure.   She hiked with a ruck sack for a pack. I think it was a cloth potato bag with a draw string, a shower curtain for a tent and she wore Keds tennis shoes long before trail runners were in vogue. Will and I read a biography on her a couple of years ago, before we had even given any thought to hiking the AT ourselves. It turns out that Grandma Gatewood had a pretty tough life. Her husband was very abusive and beat her so severely on several occasions that he knocked the teeth out of her head. I guess hiking 2,100 plus miles seemed like a vacation after the experiences she endured at home. One of the things she is famous for saying when she was asked if it was terribly hard to hike the AT at her age, she was in her 60's when she did it, was stating that it wasn't that hard, but that most Americans were 'panty waists' and weren't used to hard work. I wondered if Grandma Gatewood would consider me a 'panty waist' for waiting 45 minutes before I started hiking in the rain, or if she would think I was a tough AT hiker because I was out hiking the AT even in the rain. Well, my rain gear is a good sight better than a shower curtain, so maybe I wouldn't get good marks from her after all. We had a rain/fog combo going on as we hiked this morning. We were headed toward the Grayson Highlands where there are supposed to be some great views.   This is also home to several herds of wild ponies that they use to keep the grasses in the area at a reasonable height.   We were hoping the rain and fog wouldn't ruin our chances at taking in the views and catching a glimpse of the wild ponies.When we got up there, it was still foggy so the views were limited.   But we did see several of the cute little ponies.   Will was able to get a couple pictures so that was good. As the day went on the rain ceased and the sun started to peak out from behind the clouds. It turned into a very nice day really. We passed the Comers Water Fall. Small but pretty. We had determined to hike a bit longer today so that we can make it into our resupply stores and restaurants near Atkins Virginia tomorrow. We cooked a hot dinner at Dickies Gap and then hiked another mile or so. That's when we found this very flat spot on an old road and set up camp. A bit of a rough start but all in all a nice day of hiking. So, I'm going to turn in for tonight. Catch you later. Road Runner"," N of Elk Garden

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525204,"I think that Bill Bryson really nailed it with the title of his book A Walk in the Woods.   Because for the 500 plus miles that we have been hiking that is exactly what we have been doing: walking in and through the woods.I wish that I could write some beautiful lyrical prose to describe our hike but in all honesty after awhile the forest all looks the same and I can't tell if I am heading north or south. We are now officially into the season of spring and hopefully we have left the snows of winter behind. The trees are still bare, no buds yet. I did see some ferns growing along the trail today but the wildflowers are still dormant.We have seen only two other thru hikers the last few days: Trouble a 2003 veteran AT thru hiker and Supernova a young speedster from North Virginia, No. Va. Therefore the Nova part and he probably is a super kid. Put them together and you got a Supernova. Zoom!! We have enjoyed our solitude the last few days. It seems like we have had the trail to ourselves. This was one of the appeals of an early season AT hike. We were hoping to avoid an overcrowded trail. Today was a reminder that we are walking through American history. We passed an old schoolhouse that was built in 1894 and is being maintained by the Settler's museum. Inside the desks were arranged to face the blackboard. There was writing on the board.We got a meal at the Barn near the Atkins, Va. interchange and then grabbed a quick two day resupply of junk food to get us to Bland. We will be hungry heading into Bland.We hiked to Davis Hollow picked up some water and called it a night. We both feel that we have finally got trail tough or trail fit. We both feel like we've got our hiking legs. What does that mean? I guess the best way to describe it is that we can do the long climbs without our quads or calves feeling like they are at a burnfest. We can hike all day and at the end of the day have a little left in the tank and not feel wasted. A good feeling. It also helps that the trail has moderated. The climbs are neither as long or as steep here in Virginia. We are thankful for whatever mercies the trail offers.Will","N of Dickey Gap

We usually don't hike this early in the season so I usually spend Easter at church and with family and friends. This Easter I had to have my own quiet meditation on what Easter is all about as I walked down the trail. It was nice.It's interesting how you change over the years as a long distance hiker.   When we hiked the PCT in 2006, every 100 miles was a huge milestone and we got so excited about it. If someone hadn't already written '200' miles in stones, we made our own marker and took our picture by it. Many hikes have come and gone since then. Now, we hardly notice. You haven't heard me mention the 100,200,300,400 or 500 mile mark on this AT through hike.But that is about to change because today we hit the 550 mile mark which is about one quarter of the AT finished in a little less than a month.   For some reason that feels significant to me. There was even a sign to mark the quarter trail point!Today was a TD. No,I don't mean touch down. TD as in tough day. It didn't help that I started it off with a migraine. My family and friends know how crazy bad those can get for me. I took the meds I have for migraines and that kind of helped but for the rest of the day I had zero energy which is what happens after I get a migraine.   And of course we had long, super steep uphill climbs today.But there were also some great views. We were out in the open a lot more. And we did a bunch of ridge walking which I really love. Oh, and we bumped into 7 or 8 Amish folks up by the Chestnut Nob shelter. They live down in the valley and had walked the the mile and a half up to the shelter. It was on an open ridge and you could see their farms down below.We cooked a hot meal up there and then kept on hiking.

The trail is covered with leaves and when they get wet the trail becomes very slick. RR hit a slick rock and down she went in a full blown face plant. By the time I reached her, I could her crying and I could see the blood pooling on the rock. In that initial moment we weren't sure how much damage had been done but it didn't look like she broke her nose. We got the bleeding stopped. She had a rough day but was able to hike on. We were both thankful that the injury wasn't more severe.   And it brought to the forefront how easily and quickly a thru hike can end.All in all today's hike was pretty easy. We only had a couple of climbs that were more gently graded with some switchbacks thrown in. The weather turned early this morning and it actually turned out to be a decent day. Cool and sunny. We didn't see any other hikers. We have been hiking through the forests and after awhile it starts to grow on you. There is a deep sense of peace and contentment that I have noticed developing over the last week or so. The quiet and stillness that we experience throughout the day really penetrates deeply into our being and is healing and restorative.We hitched into Bland for an overnight stay and a quick resupply to get us a couple of days up the trail.Yesterday we hit the quarter mark in mileage and today we hit the quarter mark in time. This is our 30th day on trail including zeros. So how are we doing? I had mentioned in an earlier post that we are on the clock. In reality whether we like to admit it or not, most thru hikes are loosely scheduled. On the PCT and CDT you have to make it to Canada before the winter snows come. On the AT you have to get to Katahdin before they close the mountain. Although I'm not sure how you close a mountain.All in all I would have to say that we are doing OK with our non scheduled schedule. We have been able to keep the hike free flowing for the most part and when issues come up like RR's poison ivy, we roll with the changes. So far so good. Over the next two months we will gradually try to pick up the pace and bank some extra miles for the northern section when the hike gets tougher.We are heading out to Woods Hole Hostel for a day of R and R.

Once we had those completed, Will gave Bubba a call. Bubba is a gentleman that makes himself available to hikers as a shuttle driver. We found his phone number and business information in a plastic baggie thumb tacked to a tree when we hit the dirt road which takes you down to the north scenic high way. Will called him as we walked down the road (which is also the AT ). Unfortunately, he was at Dr.s appointment with his wife and couldn't help us, but he offered to take us back out to the trail today.   So Will called him this morning at a little after 11am. He was available and came right down to pick us up. He drove us to the post office, then he drove back to the trail, about 3 miles. He even drove us down the road about a mile from our re entry point to show us a confusing juncture of the trail and pointed out which was the correct way to go. So that was really kind and again, we sure do appreciate it Bubba! If you're ever coming in to Bland and you need a ride, Bubba is the dude. Our official start time this morning was 11:30am.   Not a typical time for us as you know. Definitely do NOT need headlamps for this start. The road was again the trail on this downhill stretch for about a mile, and then it was back in the woods going uphill.   Which is becoming Deja vu all over again quite frequently. We have made a reservation for Woods Hole Hostel tomorrow. I won't say much about the hostel itself because Will is going to tell you all about I'm sure and I don't want to steal his thunder as the saying goes. But it does affect us today because we have decided to push 20 miles into a half day of hiking. And I have to say after my little slip and swan dive into the rock sticking out of the trail, we'll my nose and the rock collided, I wasn't feeling in top form. I lost a fair amount of blood and my nose and sinus area hurt like the dickens. I told Will that maybe he should give me a new trail name. Rocky.   Because a couple weeks ago I tripped over an evil root and scrapped my chin up. Now this thing with the rock punching me in the nose. It's sort of boxer like so that's why I'm saying Rocky. Yo Adrian. I told my brother Denny about my latest fall and he said maybe we should get me a helmet to wear while I hike. Very funny.Anyway, we hiked hard today but I didn't have my usual hiker energy. At 18 miles for the day we came to the river and expansion bridge at Kimberling Creek.   We thought about stopping there, it was getting late, but no, we said 20 miles so 20 it must be. In two miles there were the Dismal Water falls and a marked campsite. We needed water and it met our mileage criteria so that's where we ended up going.   We had to get our water from the river and set up our tent with our headlamps on but we really like this campsite and we have the whole area to ourselves so it's all cool.Crawling into the tent and heading to bed now.

We had fairly easy hiking. As we were stopped for a rest break a little more than 3 miles from the hostel a northbound hiker came up to us and asked if we were headed southbound. We said that we were headed to the hostel. He said that that was odd because he had stayed there last night and was headed to Pearisburg. Oh, oh. Unfortunately he had hiked about 3 miles southbound. He wasn't too pleased but he wasn't overly dejected either as we hiked in to the hostel together. WHH turned out to be a great place for a rest day. Nevill and Michael have continued the tradition of hospitality that was started by Nevill's granmother Tillie. Tillie continued hosting hiker's until she was into her 90s. They have an organic farm and have been hosting hikers for 9 years. We got a private room upstairs in their house. It was quiet with a big soft bed. After a shower and getting laundry done, I took a nap for an hour. RR and I each had an hour long massage with Michael. It was just what we needed. Then it was time for dinner. A great meal with home made bread, salad and lasagna. Ice cream and cookies for dessert. The meals are shared as is the preparation with other guests.Jim, Celeste and George their teenage son were staying at the hostel as part of a short section hike. It was early to bed for a real good night sleep.We both highly recommend a stay at the hostel. It is the best hostel we have stayed at.

And I'm going to tell you all about it.   But let me start at the beginning. We started out our day in a very pleasant manner. A family breakfast of delicious home made food, including the bread. All that were seated around the table were hikers, so we talked hiker talk of course. We ate at a leisurely pace and then helped clear the table. We settled our bill and headed out the door sighing in pleasure at our truly awesome experience at Woods Hole Hostel. This is definitely the front runner of our Hostel experiences on the AT thus far.We had a pleasant hike through the woods coming up once more to the ridge which we followed for some time. There were several over looks that gave some great views of the verdant valley below. The most well known of these is probably the Angels Rock over look.Once we hit that, it was some steep switchbacks and then a road to follow into Pearisburg.   We went to the Food Lion and then to the Hardee's for lunch. Then it was back to the trail which was the road for a while.This is where our hiking day took a sharp dive downward. There was a very short section of woods and then that spit us out on the edge of the expressway. We thought, surely not, but it was true. The 'trail' was a cinder block barrier with a chain link fence on the top which guarded a small walk way.We walked along this for some time smelling the exhaust, looking at a disgusting amount of discarded trash and our other views besides the whizzing cars were huge factories. I had already decided that this was my worst day on the trail, but wait, it got worse. After we finally left the expressway and not long after we got back into the trees, with the expressway sounds still following us, the trail took us to a new low. For there to our wondering eyes, was a huge landfill right next to the trail. The beautiful earth had been ripped open and there was garbage protruding everywhere.   National Scenic Trail?   I think not. And the stench was indescribable.   Of course the wind had to be coming from the far side of the garbage and pushing the aroma straight at us.It was a big enough land fill that it took us a while to get away from it. Made me think of that old keep America beautiful commercial that showed an Indian standing on a garage filled hillside with a single tear running down his cheek. Truly, why this section of trail was ever allowed to remain in either of the locations I described is beyond me. I know there is a lot of policy and difficulty keeping a national trail open but really. I don't think Benton Makaye envisioned an expressway and a garbage dump when he birthed the idea of the Appalachian Trail.   I'm just saying.But at long last we got back into the forested walking we have come to know and love. We hiked until later in the evening and then found a nice campsite on a little saddle that is well guarded from the wind.So, I'm calling it a day. Catch you later. Road Runner","Woods Hole Hostel

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526464,"Yesterday was Annie's turn to rant, today is my day to whine. Sometimes you have a day on trail like today where you just can't sugarcoat it. It sucked. I sucked, my attitude sucked. It rained last night after we got set up. We waited for the rain to stop this morning, it let up a bit but it was still raining when we broke camp. The ground sheet and tent were wet and they made my pack feel heavy. The rain finally stopped but the rocks on the ridge were really slick. The rains came back and it was on and off with the rain gear all morning. We dropped off the ridge and descended down to the valley floor. We passed the Captain's house. The Captain allows hikers to camp in his backyard. However in order to get to the backyard you have to cross the creek. In order to cross the creek there is a pulley system set up to get you across without getting into the creek. Pretty sharp.We climbed up past Bailey Gap shelter and entered a rock garden where the going was slow and dificult for a mile or two. I couldn't get any kind of a hiking rythm going. You know you are having one of those days when you and your hiking partner are looking forward more to the next break than whe actual hiking. Right about then I could have used a Baileys and Kahlua on the rocks. I had enough of the AT on the rocks. Ya, I know the rocks are supposed to be a lot worse up north in Pennsylvania and NJ but I had my fill for today.We had a long undulating hike along the ridge before dropping down. The day wasn't a total loss. Focusing on the positives: we are still alive, neither of us broke an ankle or cracked our skull in the rock garden and it never rained again after noon. Finally we got to meet two of our fellow thruhikers at War Spur shelter. Crash and Holcomb had settled in for the night. Holcomb might consider taking on Crash's moniker or maybe Crash 2 as he took a header in the rock garden. But thankfully no blood, no harm, no foul. We had a dinner of refried beans and cheese on a tortilla. it made a nice burrito. We then moved on to a nice flat spot north of the creek where we called it a day. We are in the doldrums but tomorrow will be better. The rain has started to pitter patter on our tent. We are thankful that it waited until we got set up. See it is already getting better. I love listening to the rain fall on our tent while we lay here warm and dry. A lone owl cries in a nearby tree. Hoo hoo whoowhooWill","N of Rice Field Shelter on Ridge

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526433,"This hike started out with two very long, very steep uphill segments (what can I say? that's how this trail rock n rolls). But then we broke out to the ridge, which you know I really love. We came to an area of trail that was remarkable, at least to me. I'm not sure if we have made it clear, but the AT gets super rocky many times. It makes it difficult to walk, because the rocks are densely packed and at odd angles. Well, when we got to the area I just mentioned, lo and behold, the trail crew had cleared the trail of rocks! They were stacked in huge piles and domes every few feet along the way. Ahhhh, I loved it. What a huge extra effort on their part and I really appreciated it.We walked the ridge for a very long time today, and it just kept getting ridgier and ridgier until there really was no trail at all and we were walking on huge slanted slabs of rock. I thought it was fun, but when I said as much to Will I got silence for a reply so I guess not so much fun for him. Presently he said he thought we might be on the Eastern Continental Divide. We walked on for a bit and sure enough, there was a sign right there in front of us proving him right once again.I think that it is very cool to stand on the divides. From the spot you are standing the water goes to two different parts of the nation.   We have stood on the Western Continental Divide also.Oh, you know that picture Will showed you of that old cabin yesterday? Did you see how small it was, one room? Well, I don't know it's history, but I got to thinking about it.   What if that had been the Frontier home of some Virginian homesteader? I could picture the happy couple and their four rambunctious young children living in that cozy little cabin. That one room is kitchen, dining room, bedroom, living room and recreation room all rolled into one area. And the bathroom is outside a ways. I was thinking, this could perhaps work in the spring, summer and fall but in the winter when you can't shoo the kids outside to play? NO WAY!!Anyway, back to the trail. We hiked along until we came to the Audie Murphy Monument.   This is the sight of his plane crash and the veterans have erected a very cool monument.   Audie was the most decorated American soldier of World War II. People had left tokens there and some had left their dog tags.The wind picked up and was pushing us all over the place on our way down the way down the long descent to Trout Creek. I thought for a minute there we were going follow Dorothy and Toto to the Land of Oz, but no, we were able to hang on to this world and reached the bottom just as it was getting dark. So we did a super quick tent set up and now we are all tucked in for the night. Catch you later! Road Runner","N of Johns Creek

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526986,"The wind tried to lift our tent into the treetops last night.   We had 40 mph gusts and that along with the now regularly scheduled nightly rains led to a night with little sleep.   Last night was the fourth night in a row that it rained. The 5000 plus feet of climbing that we did yesterday, combined with llittle sleep led to tired legs and a low energy day. We got off to a late start. The rain had stopped by the time we broke camp.   The sun peeked out but the wind continued to howl. It was so cold with the piercing bitter wind. My hands were beyond painful, just plain numb. I feel for those hikers who have sent their winter gear home. Brrrr!!! We climbed up the ridgeline on Cove Mountain to the Dragon's Tooth, a large monolith and then took the direct route down to Newport road where Joe the owner of the Four Pines hostel gave us a lift to the Catawba grocery where we got a pizza for lunch and picked upper enough junk food to get us to Daleville. After lunch we headed back to the trail and when we reached the creek Annie decided that she needed a nap. By this time it had turned into a beautiful day.   She slept for an hour and a half.   I sat by the stream and watched the water flow. Very peaceful. It was time to move on so we crossed the footbridge but not before scoring a can of honey cream ale that the beer angel had left.We crossed some open farmlands and hiked to VA311 where the parking lot was filled with cars. This is a popular jumping off point for McAfee's Knob one of the iconic locations on the AT. The Redbuds were really starting to bloom in this section. Very colorful and a nice contrast against the hardwoods.The hiking along portions of the trail today was difficult.   The wind had blown the leaves into the trail trough and in places they were knee deep.   It was hard to see the underlying roots and rocks. The recent rains made the leaves slick.We met one new thruhiker today. Teepee a young guy from Virginia who was moving out. He seemed to be enjoying his hike.We reached McAfee Knob just before sunset and enjoyed the views. The knob is a ledge which juts out over the valley far below. From there we hustled along the ridge and found a campsite with a a picnic table. Ah luxury. We enjoyed our dinner as we looked over the twinkling city lights below.It was a low energy day for us but one that turned out to be very enjoyable with the budding Redbuds and the hike to McAfee Knob.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527043,"We got an early start with some lovely views of the sunrise. It takes some discipline to get up and on the trail by 6am each morning but in my book there are huge rewards as well. The sunrise on all its glory is high on the list for me.It was a nice downhill start and today we are heading into Daleville to resupply. We plan to make it a nero and spend the night at the Howard Johnson motel which most of the past AT hikers give the nod to.There is something about going into a town that gives your mind and body a boost. First, you know you will be able to stuff yourself with any kind of food you want to replace depleted calories and you won't need to worry about how much it weighs.   At least the food you eat right away. Will says he can smell town food from like 15 miles away! Then, there is the shower and clean clothes and sleeping in a bed out of the rain and cold. But mostly the food is think. Will says he's 'got the hungers'. He's to the point where he's burning so many calories that his body can't replace them quickly enough. I think the highlight of this days hike was when we came to the Tinker Cliffs. These are very similar to the McAfee Knob rock formations. Very beautiful, and you can look back and see the knob from there. I really enjoyed this look.Other than that, the main thing was getting to town. Which we did post haste. But I couldn't help singing the little marching song, ' over hill, over dale...' because of the whole Daleville thing. When we came off the trail the Howard Johnsons was just a few short steps away. We got registered, went our room and constructed a plan. First on the list was eating of course! It was a bit of a town walk down to the Plaza but everything we needed was there. We heard the Three Little Pigs restaurant was very good so we went there first. Loved it. Great food. We sort of made a 'pig'of ourselves there so I guess we fit right in! Then to the outfitters and then to Kroger for food which translates to hiker energy fuel.We still had to do laundry and work on our journal so this has not turned out to feel too restful.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527433,"We got packed up and had breakfast at HoJos. By the time we hit the trail it was around 8:30. I have to admit I was low on enthusiasm for hiking today. We saw Crash and Holcomb at breakfast and they were staying in Daleville for a full zero. That really sounded good. RR has been dragging a bit lately with a bum leg. It is hard to hike when you have a bad wheel.The temp on the bank read 32 degrees, the sky was dark with clouds, the forecast wasn't great and the winds were upward of 30 mph. I think all of the above contributed to my less than enthusiastic state.The trail out of town weaves around the freeway but soon we had left the noise of the city behind us and were enjoying a surprisingly abrupt change in the weather. After an initial climb which helped warm us, the trail was moderate with fairly easy terrain for the rest of the day. The sun came out and the winds died down.We enjoyed hiking through the forests as the wind whistled through the pines. Soon we were rapt with the silence of the forest. The only sounds were the crunch of dead leaves under our feet. Occasionally we would pick up the distant hammering of a woodpecker. The trees are starting to bud and the oaks are leafing out. The Redbuds provide the only real color but they are a beautiful shade of fuschia.We are seeing very few hikers. We didn't meet any new thruhikers today. We are enjoying the solitude and the sense of having the trail to ourselves. Very peaceful out here right now. Every once in awhile we see a deer or two ahead of us. Other than that we are enjoying the songbirds and blue sky.The forecast is calling for temps near freezing and a continuation of high winds. We crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway several times. We were looking to camp low with the hope of warmer temps. But when we got near Bearwallow Gap we couldn't find a suitable campsite. So we headed up the ridge past Cove Mt and found a fairly sheltered spot among the trees which we hope will cut down on the wind. We will layer up tonight and try to get toasty in our sleeping bags.Today I started out low on enthusiasm but I ended up feeling pretty good about an enjoyable day in the forest. Hopefully with a good night sleep Annie's leg will come around.Will","Daleville, Va

But we slept comfortably, good thing we have good winter gear.We were on the trail in headlamps at 5:55 this morning. In a short time the sun began to rise and it put on a colorful show as it did. Reds, yellows, oranges and purples were on beautiful display.   I really love that time in the morning. We had a ton of uphill this morning, and all day really. It turned out to be ' Just one of those days'. You know the kind. One of those days when your wagon is draggin and you have to push through and do it anyway.   For me that was pushing through and finding the strength to get me and my very heavy pack up the hills. There are days when I feel like Super Hiker Girl on the uphills. But clearly this wasn't one of those days. Despite that fact, I could still notice that we went through some really beautiful forest.   Especially the areas that were concentrated with pines.We had second break at a really cool shelter called Bryant shelter, it had a loft.   We went up to a ridge and saw the large dome like tower that the FAA built for communications. It looked sort of like a small Epcot Center to me.Then there was a rock formation that was really cool called the Guillotine. You walk under it and pray that after all these years it doesn't pick this moment to become dislodged and fall on your head. If it did, it wouldn't cut off your head, it would just crush it.So, despite being 'One of those days ' I still enjoyed my hike today.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527466,"Prior to starting our AT hike we found a good resource: atweather.orgThis site lists the shelters by state and gives a 7 day weather forecast. We have found that it is fairly accurate for the next 24-48 hours. When we can get a signal we usually check it out and when we can't we just shrug and say 'weather, it is what it is'.We can't change it and for the most part we are going to hike on. Lately 'it is what it is' has been a lot of nightly rain. Last night was no different.   Soon after we got set up it started to rain. It poured off and on through the night.   The wind was blowing hard again but for the most part we stayed dry and warm.By hiking time it was still raining so we delayed our start but it just kept raining, so eventually we had to suck it up, put on the rain gear and head out into the cold morning. It didn't take long until the sun was shining and we were shedding layers.Most of our morning was spent in a long descent down to the James River. We had some nice views of the river from the ridgeline on both the north and south side. It was one of those days where the weather couldn't decide what it wanted to do. We were in and out of our rain gear 6 or 7 times.We were continually trying to guess our next move and usually we were wrong. If we put our gear on, the rain stopped. If we waited to see if it would continue to rain before putting on our gear then we got wet and cold. If we left our rain gear on we got hot on the climbs. It seemed like we couldn't get it right today. We had some nice hiking along Rocky Creek before we began the ascent up to Little Rocky Row. On the way up we got caught in a hailstorm. The sky to the east had darkened over the next ridgeline. The sky was a beautiful indigo in color.As we approached Big Rocky Row dark clouds formed behind us and loud claps of Thunder resounded over our heads. That sealed our fate. We stopped short of Bluff Mt and called it a day. We didn't want to chance getting caught in a storm on top of Bluff. We were hoping to get past Punchbowl Shelter but it wasn't to be.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527438,"I keep meaning to tell you, I got a couple of nice compliments from my husband Will. The other day he called me a beast. Now, back home in Arizona that probably wouldn't be a compliment, it would be more like 'them's fightin' words'. But out here on the trail, beast is a compliment. It means I'm hiking hard, strong and tough. I like it. Then, after I had my collision with the rock and left blood everywhere but still got back up and kept hiking, he called me the Ultimate Warrior. Apparently Matt, our son's, favorite WWW wrestler was a guy by the name of the Ultimate Warrior. So I guess that would make me the Ultimate Trail Warrior? Anyway, even though these may not be the kind of compliments that most women would like to get from their husbands, it suits me just fine.It has been super cold and windy out here, with rain and snow thrown in to boot. A tough combination. But we are hiking in the mountains in the winter so it's what we expect. Doesn't mean we are always comfortable. It does help us move along though! The faster you move the warmer you get. This morning we dropped over Bluff Mountain and headed for the Punch Bowl Shelter. We had to dry camp last night so we were out of water this AM. When we got there we decided to cook a meal since we couldn't do that last night either.   There were three other hikers there. Postal Poet, who was doing a flip flop north and had started in Bland. Bean, who was headed south, also flip flopping and had started in Front Royal. And Mule, who was section hiking south.We got to chat with each of them for a little bit. It turns out that Bean is part of what I am entitling the 'Legends of the Falls' group. Because she has, just as I have, taken a significant fall on the trail. Yep,the roots of evil got her too! She tripped over the hidden roots in the leaves and fell on both knees, but both her knees landed on rocks! Ouch. So her right knee was pretty torn up and swollen. But, trooper that she is she just kept hiking on.As we got closer to Buena Vista we passed through a pretty cool and historical area. It was yhe Brown Mountain Creek Community.   You could see old rock fences and some foundations and an old chimney or two. This was what was left of a community made up of the first freed slaves in the area. There were a few signs giving a bit of the history and of how these people subsisted after the war. The creek itself was beautiful and would have made a very pleasant setting to live in.Once we made it to the highway we stuck out our thumb to catch a ride to Buena Vista. Only about four cars passed us before a very nice couple from Indiana stopped to offer us a ride. They weren't even that familiar with the AT, they were just being nice. We enjoyed chatting with them on the nearly ten mile drive into town. They even drove us around town so we could see what our options were. That's when we spotted the JJ's Barbecue diner. We had heard some really great things about this place so our kind couple pulled in the parking lot and dropped us off there. Talk about going the extra mile! We sure did appreciate it.The sandwiches and 'fixins' were super good. I should tell you right here that the original plan was to eat, resupply and hitch back to the trail to hike a few miles. But while we were eating I came up with a modified plan. Eat, resupply and then get a room to get out of the cold. We could get up early and see if we could catch a shuttle to the trail. So we are spending the night in Buena Vista all toasty warm and in a king size bed. Sounds mighty good to me.

Our stay in Buena Vista was short but sweet.Ken Hawkins provides shuttle service for AT hikers. Ken is getting ready to section hike Maryland and Pennsylvania.   He picked us up promptly at 7 AM and had us on trail by 7:30. The temp read 30 degrees on Ken's new Subaru. The forecast called for a downright nasty day. Falling temps with winds between 40-50 mph and the possibility of snow showers. Maybe we picked the wrong night to stay in Buena Vista. But it was time to hike on and so we did.I have to admit it has been a pain in the butt hauling around 3 or 4 pounds of winter gear when for the most part there have been days that we haven't needed it. But there have been those days when we have been caught in snowstorms or hailstorms when we are thankful that we didn't get stupid in the head and start sending gear home just so our packs would be a little lighter.Today was one of those days when we would be decked out in full winter regalia. It was one of those rare 5 layer days. I can't remember too many 5 layer days. To start the steep climb after Ken dropped us off, I had on a base layer, a merino wool hoodie, a wind shirt, a down jacket and a rain jacket on top. I needed it all.Right from the start I needed every layer, as we climbed the temps dropped and the wind cut us to our core. This would be unlike any other day that we had experienced on the AT. The wind howled overhead with a primal fury that had an element of a threatening dark foreboding feel to it. This wasn't a day to be guessing whether your equipment was good enough. You had to know or it was time to turn around and head back down the mountain.As we climbed the 2000 feet to Bald Knob conditions worsened as the snow started to fly. We were having trouble getting warm, my hands were frozen. The thought entered my mind 'should we turn around, head back, what are we doing out here today'? The wind blew us two steps sideways and then we would recover and take two steps forward. We made it across the large open field.Typically we hike a couple of hours and then sit down for a 15 minute break and then hike on. For the first part of today, there would be no stopping. We stuffed our pockets with some snacks and continued climbing. As we peaked, a gust of wind came at us with a force that threatened to knock us off our feet. I howled back into the wind like a wild man, There was no turning back now, we were all in now. RR was in the lead and she had that half crazed look in her eyes when she decides 'yup we are all in baby, let's rock it'. We passed the turnoff to Cow Camp Gap Shelter. If ever we needed a shelter it was now. But the shelter was a half mile off trail, so we continued northbound. Mercifully as we descended behind a ridgeline, the ridge formed a wind block. We began to warm for the first time. There was a calm and peacefulness amidst the fury. It was freezing cold, arctic cold but the worst was over. The temp had dropped into the teens, I'm not sure how you calculate wind chill but with the 40-50 mph winds that were ripping through us and the forest, it had to be near zero.For the most part, it would remain a 5 layer day as we hiked along the ridges. Someone left us a can of Orange Crush which turned into a nice slushy which we enjoyed with our lunch. The trail undulated along the ridges through the pines and oaks. The winds blew but the ferocity of early morning passed.We had one final climb to the Priest Shelter at 4000 feet. We stopped to get water. We only stopped for a few minutes but we couldn't believe how cold it was.   We had only seen one other thru hike over the past 3-4 days: Christmas Tree, who owns a Christmas Tree farm. Well lo and behold here comes CT as we were leaving the shelter. He had plans to stay at the shelter. Hope he has a good warm bag.We decided to head down the 4 1/2 miles and 3000 feet to the Tye River. It was the right move. After today's chill it seemed almost downright balmy at lower elevation. A little more than halfway down we stopped at Cripple Creek (don't know if it is the one that the Band sang about) and there was this small patch of newly bloomed Trilliums. The delicate and fragile flower provided a nice counterpoint to the ferocity and fury to the morning storm. Beauty and wildness abounds. Will","Buena Vista, Va

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527398,"Today is Sunday, and that may account for it, but it seems like we saw a lot of trail runners and a lot of dogs to accompany them. I think we saw 10 or 12 but part of them appeared to be some sort of running club.We climbed for 6 miles and did 3,000 feet of elevation gain in that 6 miles. You are either hiking up or down on this trail, but you like a little down with your up if you can get it.At our third break, where the trail was surrounded by pricey homes and a roadway we got to encounter a little bit of wild life. Just as we walked away from break Will spotted a little black and white critter known commonly as a skunk. It was right on the trail and laying down at a sort of odd angle.   It appeared that it might be injured. We weren't sure, but Will said he'd already been sprayed once by a skunk and that was enough for one life time.We looked at our options for steering clear and then skirted wide to the left. The skunk moved his head a bit but never got up and showed a stuck up tail to us. For some reason that very old song ' There's a Dead Skunk in the Middle of the Road' got stuck in my head. So I looked up the lyrics.Crossing the highway late last nightHe shoulda looked left and he shoulda looked rightHe didn't see the station wagon carThe skunk got squashed and there you areYou got your dead skunk in the middle of the roadDead skunk in the middle of the roadDead skunk in the middle of the roadStinking to high heavenTake a whiff on me, that ain't no roseRoll up your window and hold your noseYou don't have to look and you don't have to see'Cause you can feel it in your olfactoryYou got your dead skunk in the middle of the roadDead skunk in the middle of the roadDead skunk in the road.... Well, you get the picture except I only knew the chorus and I changed it to 'dead skunk in the middle of the trail '.It's interesting, we keep passing these old, long loose rock fences. Will thinks they are a remnant of the civil war. I need to look that up. We saw many more rock walls that were more complete.   They are never very high, just under waist high I would estimate. I picture confederate soldiers lying behind them in ambush as the union men advance up the hill. Watch out for the evil roots! I tell them. Well, it is MY imagination so I guess I can tell them that if I want to.We had some nice views today along the way and near the Hump Back Mountain. We have the town scene on our mind, so we were both willing to hike a bit longer today to get closer to Waynesboro, VA where we plan to take a full zero. Much needed I will add. So it will be no surprise if I tell you we made it to our destination at the camping area near the Wolfe Shelter in our headlamps.   There's a great spot here, flat and off to the side of a bubbly creek which will be a nice white noise for sleeping tonight. I'm sure our dreams will all be of the calorie laden town food that we are soon to be having. So I'd better hurry off to bed to see what I'm having tomorrow! Catch you later!Road Runner","Tye River

We are grateful for the little things that we usually take for granted. Warmth, sunlight.We climbed a couple of hundred feet. My body had already shut down and was in rest mode. We had a very easy 5 miles to the road where we could catch a ride in to Waynesboro. We shed a few layers on the way in and were down to our hiking shirts. RR had us to the road in no time.One of the cool things about Waynesboro is that there is a list of townspeople who offer AT hikers free shuttles. We tried a couple from the road but either no answer or no availability today. That is when Lynn pulled up in her stripped down van. She had been out hiking a section of the AT with her cousin. She asked if we were OK. We told her no problem, we were just trying to get a ride in to town. She offered us a ride if we didn't mind riding in her van. There were no seats in back. RR hopped in the front seat and I laid down in the back on her makeshift bed which consisted of a couple of Neoairs and a sleeping bag. She drove us to the Quality Inn and then on to the laundromat. Once again a huge thanks to Lynn for going out of her way to help. Call it what you will, karma or you reap what you sow, or Jungian synchronicity or the Universe provides or a graced life, but it has happened to us far too many times to be purely coincidence. When we are in need on the trail, an answer comes from some kind hearted soul. Oftentimes before we can even ask. It is magical and that is why we call it Trail Magic.We picked up a piza for lunch and hunkered down for a much needed rest. Both RR and I are running on empty, RR more so than me.

We have some business to take care of, we want to catch up on our journal and most of all we want to give RR's leg a chance to heal before heading to Shenandoah NP.

So I didn't think you would mind if I slipped in this very cute picture of our one and only grandson. William Tyler. He goes by Will for short sometimes. He calls me Nana and he calls his grandpa Will 'Bahpa'. Close enough when you are only 1 1/2 right? He is so darn cute! And we already have plans to take him backpacking when he gets old enough of course. But back to today. I went to the outfitter to get some insoles for my shoes. I was driven by a very kind trail angel from Waynesboro.   Which I very much appreciated. We went out to eat twice, we worked on strategies for our hike. I lounged around and even took a nap! It has been a true Zero day and I not only loved it. I really needed it. So I think I'll be ready and rearing to go tomorrow. Catch you later! Road Runner","Waynesboro, Va.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528443,"We had a restful stay in Waynesboro.   Our day started inauspiciously. We had arranged a shuttle ride back to the trail but our driver never showed. By the time we figured out our problem, it was a later start to our day than we had hoped for. We headed out to the road to hitch back to the trail.   A local carpenter who was heading out for a day's work in Charlottesville gave us a ride to the trail.   He had hiked a few sections with his two teenage sons.We got our permit for Shenandoah NP at the self registration kiosk and we were on our way. We climbed about 1200 feet to some communication towers. Spring hasn't arrived at the park yet. The oaks and hardwoods were bare, they had just started to bud. Most of our day was spent in the forest, every once in awhile we would walk through some pines for a nice change of scenery.The terrain was fairly easy and the tread was sweet. There was a relative paucity of rocks jutting out on the trail and those evil roots that RR has been ranting about were not a problem.   It was nice to be able to stride out and take in the views without having to worry about tripping. Blue skies and shortsleeve temps made for a real good day of hiking. We intersected and crossed Skyline drive a number of times today. Being that it was midweek, we didn't see many hikers.We cooked our dinner at Blackrock Hut which had a nice spring gushing from a pipe and then headed up and around Blackrock Summit. I had a little trouble navigating around this area as I got us going down a side trail for about a hundred yards. The light powder blue blazes looked white to my color blind eyes. RR got us straightened out but not before I argued that we were on the AT.   Disaster averted.We bumped into Christmas Tree at the hut, he survived a very cold night at the Priest shelter, but he said that he was cold all night. We hiked past Browns Gap and bumped into Tenderfoot a thruhiker that we hadn't seen before.We found a nice flat spot, called it a day and set up camp as the sun was setting.

This was a refreshing change. AND it wasn't raining or snowing either, so that was a real plus.Nature provided quite a Symphony as we walked along.   The woodpeckers played the percussion, the bigger the log, the deeper the sound. The songbirds added the woodwinds, with multiple different melodies being played by them simultaneously.   The owls got involved too, and I guess it was a song by 'The Who' because they kept bringing them up. If the pack of coyotes that I heard last night had stuck around until this morning, they could have added their howling great harmonies.And sometimes, this beautiful harmony of nature is joined by the graceful dance moves of the leaves. I love to watch this!   The large oak leaves are lying on the forest floor and then a swirling wind comes along and scoops up 40 or 50 leaves and they dance around and around in a circle, going ever higher until the wind loses it's breath and they are once again settled gently on the forest floor.It's pretty cool being serenaded by wildlife. It just seems to burst out of them in a sort of joi de vivre. They don't need anyone to stoke their egos, tell them how wonderful they are or go to their concerts to make them feel good about themselves.   They just sing because they love to sing.I've spent so much time talking about my wild nature concert that I'm going to just give you a quick synopsis of our hiking day. We did a short climb and then traversed around the Loft Mountain Campground. After which we dropped down to Ivy Creek where we picked up some water.   Then we climbed up to Weaver Mountain and we dropped down to Simmons Gap. We wanted to hit a campground for dinner but accidentally blew by it. A hiker named Turtle came by as we ate by the side of the trail. Throughout the day we crossed Skyline Drive 5 or 6 different times. At the end of our day we grabbed water by the Pocosin cabin.   And now we have found a campsite nearby and have settled in for the night. Catch you later! Road Runner","N of Browns Gap

We had another great day for hiking, cool in the morning and warming in the afternoon but it never got too hot. If we started to warm, we climbed a bit, the temp cooled and we caught a nice breeze. We couldn't ask for better weather the past 3 days. And to think we were freezing and almost blown off the mountain a few days ago.This morning we hiked past the Lewis Mt Campground on undulating terrain. We ran into the N Virginia Hiker's Club as they were out celebrating one of their members 70th birthday.We had easy hiking all morning. The highlight of the morning was breakfast at Big Meadows Wayside. A wayside is basically a restaurant, gift shop and campstore. We both had a big stack of pancakes with blackberry syrup which provided plenty of fuel for the afternoon hike. We picked up some food and we were on our way.In the afternoon we made our way past the Franklin Cliffs and Stony Man Cliffs which both offered great views to the valley below and the same farm we have been seeing for the last 300 miles. The drop rivaled those back at Tinker Cliffs and McAfee Knob minus the ledges.We had dinner at the Pinnacles Picnic area and then hiked over the Pinnacle and around Mary Rock Overlook. We started a long downclimb but couldn't find a decent campsite until we crossed US 211.Another great day of hiking. Not much spring like activity in the park yet but it won't be long before the trees start leafing out with these temps and the abundant sunshine. We have seen plenty of deer.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528425,"I lost something that had become very dear to me yesterday and Will let me tell you about even though it happened on his journal day. Yesterday, when we went to the Big Meadows Wayside, they made us leave our packs outside. I needed to get the phone wire/plug in thing out of my pack and when I did, I set my Little Blue Thing next to my pack. And when I came outside to get my pack, he was gone!!!!And I was very, very sad. I looked everywhere. But he was truly gone. I think the wind took him away. I'm sure you have already looked at the picture of him I put on this page and thought 'what's the big deal? ' Well, let me tell you about him and you may come to see why he was such a big loss.I first found Little Blue Thing in 2006 when I was hiking the PCT.   Someone had abandoned him in the hiker box in the Post Office in Stehekin. He was four little sections of an old Z-rest pad. I rescued him from there and from then on he went with me on all my hiking trips, long distance hikes, shorter distance, training , overnights, even day hikes. Whenever we would take a rest break, Little Blue Thing was there to keep me comfortable and make sure I didn't get wet if the ground was moist. And he always did his job without complaining. I won't list all the hikes we went on, you can see a lot of them on the sidebar at the left of the page. But in 10 years it was thousands of miles. As you might believe, I got very attached to him. It's like somehow he got mingled in with my trip memories. And so it was very sad to loose him in such an abrupt manner.I thought about writing an Ode to the Little Blue Thing, but then decided that would taking it too far. So I'll just say ' Good bye Little Blue Thing, I loved you well.This morning we hustled to get on the trail and moving down it. There was food involved and so that should pretty much explain the haste.   As we hiked we talked about what we might eat at this next wayside store/diner. The buttermilk pancakes with the blackberry syrup were so amazing we thought perhaps a repeat of those would hit the spot, again. Will was quite certain that those pancakes were jet propelling him forward today. Talk about carbohydrate loading.But when we got there, alas, the store and diner were much smaller and so were the breakfast options. It was food however, and food equals hiking energy. We resupplied out of the store and took our breakfast outside to the picnic tables.   That's where we met a hiker named the Big Dumb Animal. Now, remember, you don't have to accept a trail name, so don't get too upset that he's wearing this one. It's up to him. He was section hiking. Sort of filling in the parts that he left out when he had to get off the trail last year due to injuries. He had been hiking with a mutual friend of ours, HoHo and his girlfriend Chicory. They were pushing the miles in Shenandoah even more than we have been. It was good to know that he was out there and doing well. After hiking a 26 then a 34 mile day the Big Dumb Animal, or the BDA, said he put the breaks on and told them he didn't want to do anymore over 30 miles days and bid them adieu. It couldn't have been because he couldn't keep up, because he blew by us like we were standing still when we left the Elk Wallow Wayside. Looked like a very strong hiker. I think he just wanted to slow down and smell the roses as it were since he didn't have to worry about doing the whole trail this season.We crossed the Skyline road again several times today and stopped by the Gravel Springs Hut to grab some water. This afternoon we climbed North Marshall Mountain and had some great views off the really tall cliff face there. We made our way to the Tom Floyd Shelter thinking to grab some water and keep hiking so we could cozy up to Front Royal, but the water ended up being quite a hassle to get, as it was quite far away from the shelter and down a pretty steep side trail. When we got there it was a very small rock covered hole that was hard to get at. But it was water, and we got some by golly.By the time we climbed back up from there to the shelter it was getting pretty late. Will asked a girl that was southbounding if there were any flat places or campsites on up the trail. She was very adamant in saying there was nothing flat, it was all downhill. So we checked out the campsites around the shelter and found one that works for us.We have our tent set up and we are getting ready to settle in for the night.   The sun takes its leave in a brilliant show of reds, oranges and yellows. Another day has gone to bed. And so must I. Catch you later!Road Runner","N of US 211

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529064,"We set up our tent below the shelter last night.   It was a quiet night but when I went to get our food bags from the bear pole this morning in the dark, I could hear the snoring at 25 yards. This is just one of the many reasons we don't sleep in the shelters. We had a quick and easy 3 miles to US 522 where we hitched in to Front Royal. The first car that came along picked us up. It was none other than Smokey an AT and PCT veteran. He was heading out for his golf game.   He quit smoking cold turkey on the first day of his 94 AT hike, thus the name Smokey.He dropped us off at the Food Lion where we picked up a couple of days of food to get us to Harper's Ferry.   We then headed over to the Front Royal Diner where we had a big breakfast and then it was a hitch back to the trail.   It was a relatively quick resupply but from trail to trail, I would estimate that we were off trail 3 hours. That could mean anywhere from 6-10 miles depending on the terrain. As we hiked along the creek less than a mile from the road, we saw our first bear. It saw us first and left the creek running up the hillside. We hiked to the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter where we took an extended break. The Potomac AT was out refurbishing the shelter.   Great job gang and once again a huge thanks to the many volunteers who maintain the trail.   Very well marked.RR hopped in the solar shower for a sponge bath while I relaxed and supervised the workers. The Potomac ATC has some of the best, cleanest and most nicely maintained shelters that we have seen. We left Shenandoah NP yesterday.   It was probably the easiest stretch of hiking on the AT so far. We also noted today that as we descended to lower elevation that spring has once again taken hold. The oaks and maples are leafing out. The Dogwoods and Redbuds are in bloom. And there is a plethora of wildflowers, white, yellow and purple, lining the trail.It was another perfect day for hiking: cool morning, warm afternoon, blue skies, nice breeze.We have had great weather since we left Waynesboro.   I have especially enjoyed hiking in the late afternoon to early evening. The light is golden. I seem to catch a second wind and I feel strong. There are nights when I feel like I could just keep going but eventually I stop due to darkness or as the case may be tonight, the State Park boundary sign which prohibits camping outside the campground.So that's it for today. We are cowboy camping under a nearly full moon south of the boundary marker for Sky Meadows SP. The moonlight is really bright. Something we wouldn't notice in the artificial light of the city. I have to cover my eyes or wear my sunglasses to fall asleep. Warmer temps tonight. Should make for a comfortable night of sleep.Will","Tom Floyd Shelter

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528759,"This morning got off to a rather rough, and therefore later start. I went to bed last night with what I thought was a sinus headache and was awakened at around 2am with a raging migraine headache. I lay there struggling with it for a while, and then decided I might as well hike in pain as lay there in pain. Will offered to carry my food bag to reduce my pack weight and I gratefully let himBut it was 7:15am before we got on the trail which is late by our standards.   We went through the Sky Meadows State Park. The tread was nice and the grade was gentle which worked for me.After we left the state land we were met with a sign that said 'Warning, you are now entering the Roller Coaster section of the AT. Enter at your own risk'No, it didn't really say enter at your own risk, I just added that for effect. But we have been hearing about this section of trail like it was something to fear. There were a lot of ups and downs, but also some traverse and on the flat. Maybe because we have our trail legs it wasn't horrible.   Although the heat made it tougher, it was supposed to get up to 80* today. So as the summer heats up I can see how the Roller Coaster section could be brutal.We passed a tree that had a wooden sign that read ""1,000"". Pretty cool! We have hiked 1,000 miles! We each had our picture taken by the tree with the sign.We kept our eyes peeled for the sign to the Bears Den Hostel.   This hostel is quite famous on the trail. Also known as the rock castle. It is owned by the ATC. It was formerly owned by a Dr. and donated by his family after the parents passed. It is a super cool hostel with lots of history, built in 1933; it is all geared for through hikers.We hoped to take a much needed shower and wash our clothes, also much needed.   Well, we got the shower, so 1 out of 2 ain't bad. We also got a frozen pizza and some ice cream. There was a computer, tv, movies. It was just a really great vibe. If you're hiking the AT and you want to give a hostel a pass, it should not be this one. Once we finished up there, we hiked on. We wanted to make Harper's Ferry by tomorrow so we needed some more miles.   Around 7:30 pm we started looking for somewhere to pitch our tent. Well, Will found a spot on a rock ledge. Great view.   Can't pitch our tent, it's rock, so we are cowboy camping.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529148,"We had an incredible campsite last night. We found a little ledge overlooking a cliff and made it our home for the night. It was a beautiful setting under a full moon. I don't know how many times I woke up and turned over but I couldn't help but marvel at the wonders above.We got off early to a warm morning. So nice not to have to layer up and have our winter hats and gloves on. We finished up the Rollercoaster and we're on our way to Harper's Ferry. We passed the trail to the Blackburn Center and then had some of the easiest hiking of the whole AT journey so far.We made it to town early afternoon and took in some of the historical sights before going over to the ATC. We passed a plaque lauding John Brown's raid on the arsenal and his attempt to start a slave rebellion. It didn't quite work out the way he planned and he was subsequently hanged by none other than Robert E Lee who at the time was a Union soldier and later led the Confederacy. Fascinating.Thoreau wrote an impassioned plea in defense of Brown. Thoreau himself was an abolitionist who spent a night in jail over his failure to pay a poll tax. Out of his experience Thoreau went on to write a very impact full tract 'On Civil Disobedience'. I have it as part of a compendium with Walden. ""That government is best which governs the least"". Later in the day we walked by the armory Brown raided.But first we went to the ATC where we were made to feel quite welcome. They have a small hiker lounge that we enjoyed. We had our picture taken. We were hikers 35 and 36 that have signed in at the ATC who are going NoBo starting at Springer Mt. You are probably wondering where Pocahontas fits in with Harper's Ferry, Brown and Thoreau.   Well that was a hook, this isn'the about the Native American legend but about our good personal friend Pocahontas who we met on the PCT in 2013. One of the reasons we were hustling to HF was to pick up a couple of packages that we had waiting for us. Pocahontas and her hubby Legasorus live out west. They are hikers and have provided support and trail magic to hikers on the PCT for years. They are very gracious with big hearts.When we got sick on the PCT in August of 2013, Pocahontas drove 3 hours one way to pick us up, take us into her home for a week and then deliver us back to the trail healthy and hearty, ready to head north. They were a big part of our success.Pocahontas had notified us that we would have a surprise waiting for us at HF. And what a surprise it was. We received a wonderful care package of chocolate chip cookies, an assortment of candies, small snacks of chicken and tuna salad and something only a hiker would think of: a small tube of toothpaste which we needed.It took all my will power to not devour the whole bag of cookies right there at the ATC.   Awesome, thanks so much. They also sent us a nice card with a personal message that was a great morale booster. It is nice to know you are rooting for us.Speaking of the PCT, 2 thoughts: 4/21 marks the 10 year anniversary of our first foray into long distance hiking. It has taken us to many wild and beautiful places, given us incomparable memories and great adventure. We'll celebrate that in a few days. I also read recently that there have been 4500 permits issued this year for the PCT. That is INSANE. When we hiked in 06 there were about 300 thru hikers total. I am so glad that we were able to have the experience of hiking the PCT when we did.Back to the AT. We left HF late in the afternoon after touring a few more of the historical sights.   We picked up a pizza at Mena's and some ice cream at the Cannonball Deli. Refueled, we had a leisurely hike along the Potomac on a a perfectly flat rock less trail. My feet said thank you trail. It was nice strolling along the river as the commuter train came flying by. I love trains. We cranked out a few more miles in the fading sunlight, found an 8 x 8 square of earth to call our home for the night and have settled in under a full moon for a good night's rest.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529105,"Before I jump into today's hike, I just wanted to spend a couple of minutes to add my two cents about Harper's Ferry.   We usually try to leave the days events to whoever has that day to journal.   In this case Will. But I have a few quick things to say. You won't mind just this once will you? Okay, thanks.I have been looking forward to getting to Harpers Ferry for a few weeks now. It's the symbolic halfway point, so that is cool, but the true half point is more meaningful. But I think having the ATC there and a trail that passes through the town, and all the history, significant history that happened there. It was just really awesome and I was super happy to be there and to pass through Harpers Ferry.   We were making our own small bit of history. The trail is offering us more and more looks at historical places. It runs near or through them. With plenty of markers and signs to explain its historical value. This morning on our first break we stopped at the War Correspondents Memorial.   There were multiple original buildings and 7 or 8 placards telling about them. Very interesting.        While we were sitting there, a hiker whose trail name is Bones came up and introduced himself.   He lives nearby in Virginia and had taken several zero days at home. He is on a sabbatical and has until August to finish, so a little more relaxed time frame than we do.As we hiked along we kept bumping into a bunch of new hikers. These were the flip flop hikers. Pretty much all of them said they had been on the trail for two days. They had started out at Harpers Ferry and planned to hike to Maine. Then back to Harpers Ferry and hike to Georgia. We must have passed 17 or 18 of these flippers. So, very cool for them and we wish them well. It must have been people day today. Because there were two large high school groups out as well. Backpacking 101? If it was, that would be really awesome. The younger you can be exposed to the wonders of backpacking the better.The other historical building and grounds we went by today was the Washington Monument.   As you walked up the hill to it, there were all these little President George Washington factoids on wooden signs.   The stone monument itself was erected by the people of Boonsboro in the 1830s and refurbished by the CCC in the early 1930's. There's a picture of it at the top of the page. Being exposed to all these lands and buildings and monuments really gives you pause to think about our country and it's birth and struggles. First struggling for its own freedom as a nation, and then struggling to give freedom to the African American slaves. In the process ripping itself apart.We are walking through this history every day on this trail. I think it is one of the main things that sets it apart from all of the other long distance trails in the country.We had a nice surprise. HoHo and Chicory caught up with us. So good to see him and to meet Chickory. They couldn't talk long though, they were slack packing and their packs had been dropped off at a library in.   But it was good to see them however shortly. We pressed on until late in the day as we were trying to get closer to Waynesboro. The rational is, if we get close enough we can get into town earlier and therefore get more rest. But what I find funny is, the last town we were in was Waynesboro (VA) and the town we are going to is Waynesboro (PA). Sort of a town deja vu all over again. I'll be interested to see how they they compare. Twilight Zone anyone? Lol. I'll let you know. Catch you later!RoadRunner","N of Weverton Cliffs

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529341,"The trail has changed for us over the last week as we approached Harpers Ferry.   We had a great deal of solitude and had seen relatively few hikers. As we got closer to HF we started to see some SoBo flip floppers and then the last couple of days we began meeting the NoBo flipfloppers. Last weekend there was a flip flop party at the ATC. About 40 hikers attended.We met the Wanna Bs a day or two ago. They are from Texas and we only chatted for a short time. I like their name.   Bottom line, we are all wanna Bs.Further up the trail I met a young lady who appeared to be a bit exasperated by the rocky tread. I didn't have the heart to tell her that this is some of the easiest terrain that we have encountered.   I tried to encourage her to keep going at her own pace and that if she stuck with it, her hike would get better.Later in the day I came up on a guy who was obviously struggling; out of shape with a pack that was too heavy. I tried to strike up a conversation but the first thing he said was that unless Maine got a lot closer, he would never make it by winter. It made me feel a bit sad. He seemed already defeated.The flip floppers have only been on trail for a few days. I feel for them. The reality of what a thruhike entails can be a bit overwhelming initially . For some, their dreams have already come crashing down; crushed by weighty packs, gnarly tread and aching feet. I remember early on in Georgia on a few of the long steep climbs, my immediate goal was to make it to the next white blaze, just keep going to the next white blaze, blaze to blaze. Eventually if you are a wanna B, it all starts to come together: body, mind, spirit. Fusion. In that process, we move from wanna B to affirmation.   I can, I will.

We are ready for a rest day. I have gone from having absolutely no feet issues for 1000 miles to my feet are at times killing me over the last two days. Not sure if it the heat causing my feet to swell, the rocks, or my orthotics going bad or all of the above but I need a rest. Looking forward to a day off. Back on trail sometime tomorrow.

Not a complete zero like the other Waynesboro   because we hiked about 9 miles yesterday and then 7 miles today. But we still managed to find it restful. We 'slept in' until 6 am, then had a leisurely breakfast. Afterwards a planning session for our next few resupplies, then Will listened to music and I read for a bit. After which we got packed up hit the street. Will had seen a restaurant that had gyros ( pronounced heroes ) and was hot to go there. He grew up in Detroit and Detroit has a great Greek Town. The food was great! We ate in a leisurely manner and then headed to the post office. We wanted to get to a shoe store and the Walmart but we weren't sure how we were going to get there, it was 3 or 4 miles from the end of town we stayed at. But, problem solved! A woman who was leaving the post office asked if we were hiking the AT. Why yes. Do you need a ride anywhere? Was her next question. Are you kidding me? We didn't even have to stick out our thumb. I named her a trail angel right then and there.Her name is Rae, and it turns out she does this kind of thing often. Many times she offers the hikers a home cooked meal and takes them to her home. She dropped us off at the shoe store amid our profuse thanks.I bought some new shoes, it was time, 500 miles or so. I liked the soles and the construct of this shoe, but the color...Will really likes them though, which is a good thing since he's going to have to look at them for the next 500 miles or so. I'll put a picture of them on here so you can see what I mean.   You might want to put some sun glasses on before you look at it though, lol.Next we went to Walmart and got food for a couple of days. Then it was out to the road.   We didn't stand out there long before a very nice young couple who lived just on the other side of the trailhead stopped and gave us a ride. So we were back on the trail by 3 pm. The tread was pretty easy at first and so we hummed along. We passed 3 shelters in relatively quickly succession. Deer Lick, Antietam and Tumbling Run Shelters. There was also a nice park called Old Forge Picnic area, where we got water and took a break. After we passed Tumbling Run Shelter we hit a bunch of steep uphill. Since it's warm and humid right now, we were both sweating like crazy. I felt like I had taken a second shower for crying out loud. We hiked until we saw a good place to camp near Chimney Rock.

We saw more hikers today than any other day so far. Day hikers, weekenders, section hikers and flip floppers. I don't want to give the impression that it is all gloom and doom for the flip floppers. I have met quite a few who are moving along, enjoying their hike and tapping into the tribal ethos of the trail; living their dream.The rain started around 9 PM last night and lasted most of the night.   The steady pitter patter heiped me sleep.   We were ready to hit the trail around 6AM but another burst of rain had us lazing around in our sleeping bags for another hour. The rain let up so we broke camp in the rain. It was actually quite enjoyable hiking in the rain.   The temp was around 50. We were comfortable in our rain gear.   A huge difference from a few weeks ago when we had rain and 35 degrees. The rain broke our string of 8 sunny days in a row. The rain lasted most of the morning but by noon the skies cleared, the sun came out and we had another perfect afternoon for hiking.The hiking was once again easy as we had quite a bit of flat terrain. The climbs were short and gentle. We walked through hardwoods most of the day. There were some nice pines especially at Caledonia SP.The main event of the day was that somewhere late afternoon we passed the halfway mark. I guess it changes every year depending on trail conditions.   This year AWOL's guide has it at mile 1094.50. Just north of Tom'so shelter is a permanent halfway marker. Tomorrow morning we will hit Pine Grove Furnace State Park. If the store is open we may buy some ice cream in honor of the tradition of the half gallon challenge but I doubt that I can pack away a half gallon all by myself. Another great day of hiking. I have to say, the hiking has been pretty easy lately. After some of the terrain that we encountered early on, I didn't know if easy and AT could be used in the same sentence. Hoping for more of the same tomorrow. Will","Chimney Rock

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530227,"I woke up this morning and it was very cold. But not as cold as it had been earlier in our trip and so I was thankful for the little things. It got me thinking about a very little boy who taught me a big lesson on the the GDT last year.   I'm posting those thoughts here as a reminder to myself, and anyone else who may need it lol.""Have you ever noticed how young children find extreme joy in the simple things in life? I was reminded sharply of this a couple weeks ago by a small boy of about 6 or 7. We were sitting in the parking lot at Maligne Lake on the GDT. Below us was a grassy knoll. A car pulled up beside us and a little boy jumped out. He took one look at the hill and he started yelling ""I gitta run down the hill! I gitta run down the hill! "". He proceeded to do so yelling ""wheeeee!"" all the way down. And then it was ""I gitta run down the hill again!"". You get the picture. And I wondered, when did I lose this simple all out joy of a child? So I started tuning in. When we had been out on the trail for many days and came into town to get a room, I would suddenly fling out "" I gitta sleep in a bed! I gitta sleep in a bed! Wheeeeee!"" Or if we had been slogging through the bogs with no trail and we finally made it to the trail, I would sing out"" I gitta walk on trail! I gitta walk on trail! Wheeeeeee!"" Or if we were car camping and I got to have a real pillow "" I gitta have a pillow! I gitta have a pillow! Wheeeeee!"" It may sound a bit corny but somehow it helped me tune in to the small joys of life. Try it, you'll be glad you did.""We were a couple of miles out from the Pine Grove Furnace State Park. This is where they have the half gallon challenge.   Since it is in the vicinity of the halfway mark for the trail.   The challenge? Eat a half gallon of ice cream down, all by yourself in a 30 minute time frame and you have met the challenge. It's a hiker/ hunger thing so don't worry if it doesn't make sense to you. We were there too early to try it though, even had we wanted to. The park was chock full of people dressed for running. Today was the Ironmasters 50K race. This was a really nice state park. Nicely laid out and nicely maintained. I was a little concerned when I saw race markers along the AT. Did I mention that there were a whole bunch of runners? I could imagine us being practically bowled over as they raced by. But as it turned out that was a false alarm because we hiked through the marked section and the race course split off from the AT. Whew, disaster averted. Time to pick up the pace! Next stop Green Mountain general store, where we ate a huge cheeseburger with a side of fries. Very filling and yummy to boot. By way of resupply we just picked up some snacks cause guess what? We plan to eat dinner at a restaurant in Boiling Springs.   I could really get used to this arrangement.   Let's see....lunch and dinner out vs. packaged rice, dehydrated potatoes or refried beans. Perhaps some couscous. Yep, I don't have to think about it very hard, eat out wins!We hiked until we neared Boiling Springs.   That's when the whole trail through the pasture thing starts. I guess there is about 14 miles of that. And since they spray it with some pretty nasty pesticides they want you on the narrow trail and nowhere else. Hmmmm. Once we got into Boiling Springs we got a few more things by way of resupply.   Then we found the only restaurant open on a Sunday, and place called Anile's. Pizza and Italian food. Very good. I recommend the lasagna. We put in 27 miles but it felt even longer since we spent several hours off trail eating today.   I'm ready to get some rest so I can go at it again tomorrow.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530264,"We left the suburbs of Boiling Springs early this morning. It was warm as we walked through the farmlands and flatlands. We had to carry extra water as we were walking past streams and creeks that were laced with pesticides.   The Aqua Mira that we use is pretty good at protecting us from pathogens but it probably doesn't do much for leaching out bad chemicals.After we left the flatlands we actually did some climbing today. We had 3 climbs of about 1000 feet each. The climbs were fairly moderate, so all in all today continued the trend of fairly easy hiking. Most of our afternoon was spent in the forest.   The forest continues to green up. The underbrush is getting thicker and the trees are leafing out. Spring is happening before our very eyes and it is amazing to see the subtle changes on a daily basis.The hiking through Pennsylvania has been relatively easy so far with the exception of these rock gardens that pop up on the trail every so often that at times slow us down to a crawl. I guess it gets worse further north but we'lljust keep enjoying what the trail gives us day to day and worry about those nasty rocks up north when we get there..On the way into Duncannon AWOL's Guide even mentioned a 5-6 mile stretch that was 'rocky'. But it wasn't any worse than what we had already encountered.   So we were thrilled. AWOL must have been having a bad foot day.We got to Duncannon around 2 and headed to the Doyle which is an iconic spot on the AT.   We were greeted by Pat, one half of the husband wife team that owns and runs the Doyle. We had a nice meal, then headed down the street to 3B Ice Cream for a double scoop cone.We crossed the Susquehanna river as the cars and trucks zoomed by and then reentered the forest for our last climb of the day. We quit early and shared a campsite with Soho a young German girl whom we met at the Doyle. She is hiking north to finish up Pennsylvania and that will conclude her section hike of the AT. So a big congrats to her.Another nice day on the AT. We are enjoying hitting these little towns along the way. The locals that we have met are friendly and knowledgeable about the trail.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530170,"I hate to say it, but there isn't much to say about today's hike. 'A Walk in the Woods' it was. We passed three shelters and let ourselves get pretty dehydrated in the heat of the day; got rained on a little and saw two different thunderstorm systems that were on the verge of colliding, one from the east, one from the west,both with lightning. But that was about it.So I thought I'd talk to you about what I am calling, 'the Chipmunk Plan'. It's pretty much Will's idea but I don't think he'll mind if I tell you about it. It's not a secret plan or anything. And of course I'm behind it 100% since we are Team Tyler!You'll remember that we have a time frame for our hike because of our dog Jedi that we share we our son Matt. That time frame is four months. So Will divided the mileage by the days, threw in a few rest days and came up with the magical daily mileage figure of 21.5 miles per day.  We have tried to average that from the gitgo. That was a challenge in Georgia where apparantly know one knew what a switchback was when they built the trail in that state. So we're all on the same page about our daily mileage right? Here's where the Chipmunk Plan comes into play. You know how a Chipmunk gathers up acorns and keeps stuffing them in his cheeks until they look like they're going to explode and then he goes and buries them away for winter? Well Alvin, I mean Will, has us hiding a few extra miles away in our cheeks. In Shenandoah NP where the terrain was more forgiving and anywhere else, we're putting those miles in our little Chipmunk cheeks. That way when we hit the White Mountain Range, which has a reputation for making mileage difficult, we'll know that the extra miles we chipmunked away will offset the miles we are short on. The Chipmunk Plan! See how it works now? Okay, great! Well, I guess that's all I have to say about that. We have a nice campsite here by the river. We're hunkered down and ready for bed. So I guess I'll turn in. Catch you later! Road Runner","Tom's Run

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530296,"It got cold last night by the creek but we warmed up quickly as soon as we got hiking. Our immediate goal was Swatara Gap and PA 72 where a quick hitch got us into Lickdale and multiple fast food options. This went hand in hand with our latest philosophy of 'never pass up a small town that has an establishment with fast food'. So today's journey to the growing metropolis of Lickdale found us at the following in short order: Subway, Love's, McDonalds, Chester Chicken and last but not least Dunkin Donuts. My grand total: an egg sandwich for 2nd breakfast, 2 chili dogs, 2 bananas, a Coke, a mocha frappe and a jelly donut. I am convinced that the AT is the only long distance trail on which a thru hikers could actually gain weight.We picked up some goodies including pizza to help get us to Hamburg which is our next rest stop. We are finding that the rest days are getting to be more important the further up the trail we get and the more we tap into and burn through our reserves. We are going to try to have at least one rest day a week.I guess the big excitement of the morning was that we had our 15 minutes of fame as we had a small group of truckers gather around us at Love's truck stop while we were eating/gorging. They saw our packs and when they found out that we were thru hiking the AT and had walked all the way from Georgia, they became truly enthused. We appreciated their enthusiasm, support and sincere compliments mixed perhaps with a tinge of wistfulness as perhaps their time for such an adventure had passed.It was a reminder that we are so fortunate to be living the thru hiking life and in some way we carry not only our own dreams but perhaps those of whom will never have the opportunity that we have. Anyway it was fun interacting with the truckers. They put in a good day's work and I think that we take a disciplined and blue collar attitude towards our hiking. And while it may be work, it isn't a job. We have a lot of fun and there isn't anything that we would rather be doing.I think that I ingested more caffeine in one sitting than I typically would in a month. So fueled by a massive sugar/caffeine buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, the miles passed by rather quickly. Annie also thought that it helped my sense of humor. I see why these young kids are into the 5 hour energy drinks. The day turned out to be overcast and gray with the temp dropping. Perfect for hiking. It was another easy hiking day through the forests until we hit those rockpiles. If you ever saw one of those old movies with the guys on the chain gang splitting rocks and you wondered what they did with those rocks? Well they planted them on the AT in Pennsylvania where they have mutated into the most grotesque looking rocks you will ever see. At least that is what my feet say. By the way, my feet problems are better with new insoles to replace my worn down orthotics and the cooler temps in which my feet don't swell as much. However the rocks are taking a toll with not only my feet (thank you Upjohn for discovering Ibuprofen) but my patience. It goes something like this, you are hiking along at a nice comfortable pace on relatively flat smooth trail through the green forest when you come upon these deformed pointy rocks which are stacked in various combinations. You carefully consider each foot plant, slowing down to tortoise pace and in spite of your best intentions you end up often slipping off the rocks so that you stagger from one side of the trail and wobble like someone who has had one too many Golden Monkeys.We ended up crossing multiple roads. The distant drone of cars and trucks was competition for the sweet songs of the birds which accompany us. Every so often we catch the sweet fragrance of the blossoming Dogwood and all is well and peaceful on the AT. Will","Rausch River Campsite

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530287,"You had to have watched Popeye to know who Whimpy was. He was a cartoon guy that loved platefuls of hamburgers but was always trying to eat now and pay later.   Ergo, today's title. And what relevance does it have to todays hike you might ask? Well, today our target was Hamburg, PA. So if that stirs up visions of a lovely town in Germany, then obviously you are not currently a through hiker and don't have your food rage going on. Because when I hear the word Hamburg, I immediately want 10 hamburgers with fries.We hiked late last night but still had 16 or so miles to go before we could get to food, I mean town.   That's why Will came up with brilliant idea of getting up at 4 am and hiking by 5 am. This would get us to town quicker so we could take full advantage of our room and our rest time there.   This we did, and we were soon hiking merrily along with our headlamps on. Rocks have been an issue on this section of the trail so you really have to hike carefully even in the daylight, let alone the dark. But I thought the headlamps did a good job illuminating the trail and rocks and although there were a few stubbed toes, no one fell.But Will and I did get in a little snit after the sun came up.   I was in the lead trying to get us to Hamburg as quickly as possible and he wasn't hurrying fast enough for my liking. We rarely get in a set to. I am going to say that huge volume of sugar was a large contributer to this one. But we're not Ozzie and Harriet either. Even though Ozzie and Harriet weren't Ozzie and Hariet in real life. Anyway our first break was very tense and quiet. But at the end of it I asked Will for a Mulligan.   Which is a do over for all of you non golfer readers. He said yes, we put him in the front instead of me and that was that. While it was rocky on the trail today, it was fairly flat so we could make pretty good time. We were on the trail at 5am as I mentioned and coming down the last very steep descent at around noon and in all that time we didn't see one other hiker. I think we have pretty much passed through the bubble of flip flop hikers out of Harper's Ferry. The trail almost seems empty now. We walked past the Railroad station and up to Hwy 61. There was a Triumph motor cycle dealership. We thought we could stick our thumbs out for a ride to Hamburg there. As we set down our packs, one of the mechanics came out, asking if we were through hikers. When we said yes, he gave us both a piece of fruit! His trail name was Treesleeper. He had hiked in 99; and then in 2012 he started rehiking the AT. He got as far as the Hamburg area. He said he was offered this job riding Triumph motor cycles and then well, he met this girl.....So he quit the hike and took the job and the girl. He looked happy to me.Once we turned our attention back to hitching a ride a very nice fellow in truck pulled over and offered us a ride almost immediately. His name was Andy and he had already given 2 other truckloads of hikers a ride to various places today. At our request he dropped us off at the Walmart.   Then he offered to come by and pick us up when we were ready to go back to the trail. Talk about above and beyond the call of duty!   We sure did appreciate it. We dropped off my migraine script and then walked the longish walk to the Microtel. This is the only hotel in the area right now so they kind of have a corner on the market.   It was a bit after 1 pm but our room wasn't ready. Which was disappointing to say the least. We took care of washing our laundry though. By that time we could get in our room. Eating was next on the agenda. We headed over to Wendy's for a salad and sandwhich. And guess what? It was cold and rainy!! We had our rain gear on but we still had to run a bit to get out of the nasty weather and head back to our room. And you can bet that we said several times to each other how glad we were that we didn't have to sleep out in this cold, wet and rainy night. So, we're sleeping snug, warm and dry tonight and loving it!!Also, a very Happy Birthday today to my brother Doug.That's all for tonight my friends.   Catch you later!

We decided to take a full zero today. it is one thing when you are hiking and it is raining. You just hike on. But when it is raining on a zero day, and you don't HAVE to be in the rain, it feels so good to be in a warm comfy room. And it feels so cold and nasty just walking across the road for lunch.We are staying at the Microtel in Hamburg. It is a bit pricey. $100. It has limited amenities: no fridge or microwave, no computer in the lobby but it is the only show in town. There is a Cabelas and Walmart across the highway along with several fast food joints.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530681,"Our day started out pretty smoothly. Up at 5 am, checked out of the hotel by a little after 6am. But then it took a turn to the not so smooth side. Remember when I told you that Andy had given us his phone number and volunteered to take us back to the trail? Well, either he misspoke when he gave it to me, or I didn't enter it correctly in the phone. Because when Will called it yesterday he got a 'no such number' kind of recording.   It was probably my mistake.   Whatever the case, that meant we had to hitchhike cold turkey.Hamburg turned out to be a tough hitch for us this morning.   It took over an hour for a kind hearted young man to stop and pick us up. We sure did appreciate it! He dropped us back in Port Clinton where we had gotten off the trail on Thursday. We made our way through the streets and to the edge of town where the AT went into the woods.   A man was down by the road with two young puppies getting his morning newspaper.   These puppies were so cute! They were about 4.5 months and a yellow lab/Sharpe mix. The lab part of their parentage was in full flush as they romped over to say hello and then decided they were going to hike the AT too! It took a while and several treats by the owner but we finally disengaged ourselves and continued hiking. But seriously, they were the cutest thing we saw all day. We always get a bit homesick for Jedi when we bump into a dog, especially anything with lab in it.Then it was a long steep climb up onto the ridge, with views of the highway and the Hamburg area as we neared it. We passed Pulpit Rock and then the Pinnacle Rock. I got a kick out of the trail register we signed up there. The entry of a previous hiker ran something like this. 'And on the 8th day God looked at Pennsylvania and decided it didn't have enough rocks in it. So He created enough to fill the whole state. Especially the hiking trails. And that's how Pennsylvania got it's rocks'. Well, now there's an idea. You may or may not know that Pennsylvania has a very bad reputation for being outstandingly hard to hike due to the rocks on the trail.   As I walked along chuckling over that register entry, I came up with my own theory on how the rocks got on this trail.You see, when Will was a young boy and he did anything rash or silly, his dad would say, 'what's the matter with you kid? You got rocks in your head?'. So I thought about it, if everyone who hiked the trail since the late 1930's had rocks in their head, and since most of them were men it follows (lol), then every time they shook their head over something the rocks fell out on the ground, and THAT'S how the AT got so rocky in Pennsylvania.   It's just a theory mind you.We finished up at the Allentown Shelter. Have the place to ourselves. Still pitching our tent though. But this is a pretty nice shelter.   I guess I'd better turn in. All those rocks made my head hurt. Catch you later!

It was flat and soft. There was no one at the shelter. It was quiet until around 9 PM when the rain started. It rained for most of the night and it was still raining when we broke camp. It rained all day. It was nasty. We had some rock hopping and climbing today that would have been fun on any other day, but today with the rain it was a bit slippery. There is one area where the rocks are piled up on a bit of a 'knife's edge' that slant at a 45 degree angle. When we were going through, the wind decided to start howling at about 30 mph which added to the fun. I got a good picture of RR and then the phone just decided to quit. Kaput, gone, nothing. We hiked on to Lehigh Gap and made it down to the road. We needed to make a phone call but we were out of luck.Bob and Pat a couple who live in Lehighton had reached out to us. Bob had read our journal and offered us a night at their place: a soft bed, a meal, a shower and laundry. Wow!!! How good is that? We got back with Bob and decided that we would meet near Lehigh Gap. However only one problem. Bob's phone number was in my email on our cell phone which no longer worked.We hitched into Walnutport and stopped at the McDonalds. We shed our wet clothes, got a hot chocolate and then explained our predicament to a group of teens at another table who kindly lent us their phone. We got a hold of Bob who made it to McD in no time and whisked us away to the comfort of his home. It was great. We got a shower, did laundry and sat down to a great home cooked meal by Pat. We had stuffed shells. They were the best stuffed shells I ever had.Bob and Pat were very welcoming and it felt as if we had been friends for a long time. Their hospitality and kindness couldn't have come at a better time. It was a nasty hiking day. Wet, cold and windy. By the time we hit Lehigh Gap we were chilled.

We were cold, soaked and well, a little down hearted as Bruce would say, when Bob picked us up yesterday. But now we were clean, very well fed and all our stuff was dry. That's huge! Just in that short time we were in their care Bob and Pat helped to lift us up. Complete strangers except for our journal. But you know how there are some people you meet and you feel right away like you have known them for much longer? This was one of those times. They have been through a lot, and it's not my story to tell, it's theirs. But I will say that some people would go through something like that and become bitter. But Bob and Pat came through it looking for ways to help other people. And for that I am very grateful. As you climb up the trail here, you are looking at one of the steeper, longer climbs in PA. It is the Superfund area and zinc smelting has made it rocky and steep. You also do some large rock climb here. A bit more of a big deal for us because it was wet and slippery.   We had to go slowly and cautiously. But we made it through without mishap. We took a break toward the top and while there met a new hiker. His trail name is Mac and he is from Toronto in Canada. He started around Harper's Ferry. Of course Will immediately started asking him if he was a hockey fan. Which he was and that makes him a true Canadian in Will's book lol.More trees and more rocks. We stopped by the Leroy Smith shelter and picked up some water. Mac came in while we were there and decided to camp in the shelter. We wanted to put in a few more miles so we hiked on a bit and then cooked a hot supper by the electrical tower. We passed through Wind Gap and then up over to the ridge on the other side.   As soon as we crested it we started looking for a place to camp. It's a very weird thing. During the day when we don't need them, there are all sorts of fabulous campsites, but late at night when it's coming on darkness they are no where to be found! Well, we found a sort of flat spot covered with leaves. There seemed to be a few rocks but beggars can't be chosers right? That's right, but after we pitched our tent and got in, these turned out to be very sharp rocks. I had to find some spare clothes to drape over them and deflate my Neoair to half full so I wouldn't puncture it. Hope that works out for me. Okay, it's after 8pm and I guess I'll call it a night.

We had decided to take it easy and cut back a bit this week but this isn't the way we had planned. The hike into Delaware Water Gap was uneventful. We are on the verge of leaving Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania has been an interesting state. It has some of the flattest and easiest hiking on the AT and then it has some of the most maddening stretches of hiking with rocks that slow you down to a crawl. Today we had both.We made it into Delaware Water Gap by late morning and went to the outfitter which was closed. We then went to the local bakery and had the daily special: a hot dog and big slice of apple pie for $2.95.We needed to resupply and then there was the matter of our Samsung Galaxy Note 5 which was nonfunctional. We hitched to Stroudsburg where we were dropped off at the Best Buy. I bought the protection plan for the phone when I purchased the phone at Best Buy. But unfortunately they were not able to replace our phone. They determined that since the phone was less than a year old that it would have to go throught the manufacturer's warranty. They did offer to sell us one of their other expensive smartphones. We declinedWe walked over to 5 Guys for lunch and had cheeseburgers, fries and milk shakes then walked down to Weis markets to get a few days of food. From there it was a hitch back to DWG. Ironically enough we got picked up by a Uber Driver--no charge.We went back to the bakery for more dessert and then decided to call it a day at the Church of the Mountain Hostel. The high point of our day was the two visits to the bakery; not to be missed. It was raining again by evening so we decided to stay warm and dry and start afresh in the morning.Today was a low point for both of us. We are out of a phone temporarily so we are unable to journal. We had been using Guthook's App and in terms of communication we are out in the cold. Our situation seemed a bit bleak especially with the lousy weather but after we sat down and really thought about it, we both said that we had hiked for years without a smartphone and that it was more of a convenience than a necessity.

Yeah, it was one of those mornings. But nothing to do except to buck up and hit the trail.This morning the 'trail' was walking down the streets of Delaware Water Gap until we were directed to the sidewalk that ran along side of the expressway and over the bridge. About halfway across we saw the sign that had been painted on the side walk. It was a big box that had Pennsylvania on one side and New Jersey on the other. So we could step back and forth from one state to the other in one little stride. That is always a fun thing to do. New Jersey, yay!!   But it was raining, again, boo!Just because it is now New Jersey doesn't mean that it is suddenly rock free. So we continued to trip and slip on the rocks all day long. We bumped into a couple of guys that were doing a southbound hike for a couple of days. I made sure to tip them off about the wonderful bakery in Delaware Water Gap.We passed the sign for the Mohican Outdoor Center. This got a pretty big write up in our Appalachian Trail Guide but we hadn't hiked far enough and so we gave it a miss. Along the way we met Jen and Julie, they were flip flop hikers heading north. They had started in Maryland so had just finished hiking PA. They were hiking pretty strong I thought. They had spent the night at the Mohican Outdoor Center but were less than positively impressed by their experience. They were planning to call it a night at the Brink Shelter. We hit the turn off for the shelter and kept on walking. If the weather was bad enough, we had plans to hike to Culvers Gap and then hitch the 2 miles or so to a little motel and get out of the rain. As it was, the rain let up and we hiked until we could see the road below and also the lake and found a very small spot to put our tent up. There is supposed to be a hiker friendly restaurant and a bar with a restaurant to choose from in the morning so that makes us happy.While we were looking for a place to set up camp, Will scared up a porcupine. It had its quills all bristled and everything. They are a funny looking little animal. Well, here's hoping it doesn't rain too hard and flood us out. Looking forward to a hot meal in the morning!

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531833,"We dropped down from the ridge above Culver's Gap and headed down to the road looking forward to a great breakfast. To our dismay the deli was out of business and the restaurant was closed.It was another gray gloomy day. It rained off and on. The woods for some reason were bare. I guess spring hasn't arrived in this part of New Jersey. We didn't see any hikers today. We hiked through High Point State Park where there was a tower marking the high point in New Jersey. Makes sense. My shoes are shot, they have been raked over the rocks and shredded. I slipped and fell twice today on the wet rocks but no major damage. RR went down once.Our late afternoon hike was through the farmlands and flatlands which allowed us to pick up the pace and arrive in Unionville NY, a quaint little burg. We stopped at Horler's market. Butch gave us the lowdown on the town from a hikers perspective. We picked up some snacks and got a permit for free camping at the park. Then we went to Annabels for a large Sicilian pizza which provided us with enough food for 3 meals.Our planned easy week has fallen by the wayside as we needed to pick up the pace to get us to our next resupply point Greenwood Lake NY where where we have a bounce box with a tablet in it. We just need to get there on post office time. We'll carry the tablet for journalling.Badlands, ya gotta live it every dayWill","S of Culvers Gap

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531832,"We were very grateful for the little oasis at the park that the town set up for us through hikers. That way we could eat and resupply and just go to bed without hiking back out of town and looking for a place to set up camp. It did have a few things that were kind of a challenge for me in terms of getting a good nights sleep. The church bell for one thing. This rang every hour on the hour all night long. I think the church was within a block or so of us. The second was the two large flood lights that lit the park up. And the third was the several teenagers that were running through the town yelling at the top of their lungs and kicking metal trash cans around. So not my best night of sleep, but we had nice grass to sleep on and no rocks!We were up at 4am and on trail by 5am today. We walked through town and back out to where we left the trail last night. Shortly we were on a very nice piece of trail with smooth tread. Ahhhh. It feels good to stretch our legs and stride out without tripping over the rocks all the time. Now if only the weather would cooperate. But no. Within about a half an hour of our start time, it was raining. Well, you can't have everything I guess. Today had more short and very steep ups and downs in it. Again , the rain made this a bit treacherous at times. We stopped at a shelter to have our break. This got us out of the rain for about 15 minutes anyway. We also walked through the Wallkill National Scenic Wildlife Perserve. There was a large wooden bridge to span the water we crossed there. It was kind of a weird day in terms of weather. It would start as a soft rain and then work its way into a hard rain and then quit. And you would think, yeah! alright! It's done for the day. But no. In a few minutes it would start the cycle all over again. It was threatening to get in the way of our plans. You see, the reason that we left Unionville so early this morning was that we were trying to make a dash to Greenwood Lake, NY. We had sent our bounce box to the Post Office. Post Offices have hours that are a bit short for hikers. If we didn't make it to the Post Office by 5pm we would only have until 12 noon on the next day, Saturday. Which wouldn't be quite enough time for us to get everything done and then sending it back out.The harder it rained, the wetter and colder we got, despite our best efforts. We have been hypothermic before and so we know how quick a person can go down from it. It wasn't an experience that we wanted to repeat. So when we got to a possible bail out road, we stood there and hashed it out for a while. We could hitch at Country Road 517 into Vernon, NJ. There is a church there called St. Thomas Episcopal that allows hikers some respite. We got warmed up and reconnoitered about what to do. After hashing it out a while, we decided to go for it.Along the way, we bumped into a young guy that was section hiking southbound. He was wearing no rain jacket and not even a shirt! He had suspenders on, shorts and the usual foot gear. I'm feeling like a popsicle and this kid is walking around in shorts and no shirt! I asked Will, how can he do that?!   Will just said the power of youth. Indeed. We had some very rocky going later in this hike. Of course this slows you down and we were trying to push our pace as much as possible. To get to our goal and to try and stay warm. Our effort paid off because we made it to the Post Office with about a half hour to spare. Greenwood is a small resort town so our only feasible option for a motel was a place on the lake called the Linden. We had some difficulty getting ahold of the manager to see if they had any rooms available. They did, but without going into too much detail let me just say it was a very weird vibe here. If we had another option we would probably have taken it. But at least we were out of the rain and the room had heat. No laundry facilities and no laundromat in town. We took a shower and got cleaned up, hung our clothes about the room to dry and then went to the Chinese restaurant. It was very good by the way.   We really needed a phone to try and take care of our broken phone issue plus some other things but this place doesn't have them.But hey, we made it to the Post Office and we will sleep indoors out of the rain. Be happy with the things you have right? Or, wheee, wheee, whee! I gitta sleep in a bed! Catch you later! Road Runner","Unionville, NY

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533411,"When my children were very young, I used to read them a Sesame Street story called 'Grovers Bad Awful Day'. In it, just about everything that could go wrong with poor Grovers day, did. His mother was there to give him love and support so it was all good. Why do I bring this up? Because today we could have written the sequel.   The title would be ' Roadrunner and Will's Bad Awful Day' of course.    And just so you know, unlike Grover, my mom wasn't there to make it all better.We woke up at our usual time and got showered packed up and ready to get back out on the trail by 6am. We looked out the window and surprise, surprise, it was raining. Hard. This makes day 8 or 9 of pretty much daily rain for us. All of our stuff is finally dry and so we decide that it's not worth it and we will wait it out until it quits. We both rest and nap for awhile. It continues to rain and so we start to entertain alternative plans. We could spend another night off trail and get some things done. But not at the Linden. We searched and surfed the internet but to no avail, we didn't really have any other options for lodging. Our next idea was to take the transit bus to Warwick, NY to pick up some new shoes for me. Remember those beautiful blue shoes I bought about 3 weeks ago in Waynesboro, PA?   Well, the rocks just totally chewed them up. Especially my right one. It was so bad that it was causing strain and injury to that leg. So we decided after much discussion, to head to Warwick where there was a Athletic shoe store called Boots to Sneakers. We pulled up the transit schedule and looked at it long and hard.   There was a bus headed to Warwick from the park and ride at the other end of town.   We left the room about 9:40 to arrive early for the 11:16 bus.By this time it had stopped raining, thankfully.   We sat there for well over an hour and sure enough, at about 11:20 am the bus pulled up to our little bus stop. ......and kept right on going. We yelled after it but that didn't matter. Apparently this was not the correct bus stop.   So now it was going for 11:30 and the shoe store was only open from 11am to 2pm. We decided to try and hitch. So we walked all the way back down to the other end of town and stuck our thumbs out. It took us a while but finally a nice guy picked us up. He was going to Warwick which is about 10 miles down the road, but he had never heard of the shoe store I was trying to get to. To his credit, he pulled over and asked a couple of random people once we got to town but they had never heard of it either. Uh oh, now we're getting nervous . We thank him and hop out in the middle of the downtown.   I ask the first likely couple. They know the store and where it's located. Unfortunately, it's nowhere near here. Turns out the store has a Warwick address but is nearly in Vernon, NY.    Are you seeing the bad awful part of our day here?Still determined to go to the shoe store because of how bad my shoes are, we decide to try and hitch there. It's now around 1pm. We stand on the sidewalk and stick our thumbs out. This is going to be a tough one.   But (spoiler alert) this is where our bad awful day starts to turn around.   As we're standing there, a woman on foot sees us and asks us where we are trying to get to.   We tell her, and she also knows where it is. She says wait here and I will bring my car here and take you there.   Oh Happy Day!!!! When she came back she had her husband with her ( I can just imagine that conversation. ' You told complete strangers you would drive them where? They could be anyone! !). They drove us to the shoe store but it was closed when we got there! No, I'm just kidding. It was open and we really appreciated their kind generosity. Really liked the store and the owner was great. He had a good selection of shoes I could use. So I bought a pair of the Brooks Cascadias. Asics weren't doing me right. Will bought a pair of shoes too. Then it was back out to the road to hitch back to the trail. A super nice young man picked us up.   He was from the area but had lived and worked on the west coast for several years.   He had even been a trail worker on the PCT. Cool. We had him drop us off at the Bellvale Farms Creamery. They use the cream from their own cows to make this ice cream, and believe me it is amazing!The ice cream place was next to the trail and so we started out hiking with happy bellies. Today's hike took us through the woods and on the rocky ridge. It was Mother's Day so we saw a lot of families taking a little hike together. (Not my best Mother's Day by the way ). We were nearing the end of our hiking day. We needed to hit a stream and pick up some water.   As we stepped out onto a road there were a couple of guys and a dog just finishing a hike. Will asked them if they had seen any streams nearby. They had, but one of them, we would find out later his name was Brannin) invited us down to his house to get our water. And then thought a moment and said. You're welcome to pitch your tent on my lawn. How kind! We looked at each other and said sure! Well, Brannin not only gave us water and a place to pitch our tent, he made us dinner as well. And we all shared stories from our hikes and our lives.Today started out as a bad, awful day. But through the human kindness of all the people who gave us rides and then Brandons amazing generosity, this day was totally turned around. Sometimes when we least expect it, kindness heals our hurt and pain. Okay, well, long day folks. So I guess I'll turn in. Catch you later! Road Runner","Greenwood Lake, NY

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533261,"Today was a day of many short ascents and descents. Some were steep. We did some rock climbs and scrambling. We hiked through a 30 foot slot called the Lemon Squeezer. It was our most challenging day in awhile. My legs had gotten a bit lazy with all the flat terrain we had encountered. Today they had the burn going again.We started our day by waking to the sunrise on the front lawn of Brannin's house on the shores of Mombasha Lake. Brannin greeted us with some fresh fruit and then kindly drove us back to the AT so that we didn't have to walk the road.We did a small climb then skirted Mombasha lake before dropping down to Harriman SP. There were some nice pines in this area and this is where we went through the Lemon Squeezer. It is a short slot through a rock formation. We had to take off our packs to get through.We hiked through the forest along a ridge under blue sky. The temps rose as the day progressed and we were sweating as we climbed the ridge. We had a nice cooling breeze. We crossed several roads and the noise from the cars obliterated the sweet birdsong from our constant companions.We climbed Black Mt then dropped down to cross Palisades Parkway, a busy 4 lane divided highway. Then it was another climb up West Mt where we cooked dinner before dropping down to a road where we saw our second bear of the trip. I kind of felt sorry for the bear. It seemed to be hemmed in by roads, cars and noise.We made our final climb of the day up to Bear Mt where we set up a stealth camp in the fading light. We had a visit from the SP police/rangers who checked out our campsite and gave us the all clear as long as we were up at first light and took out our trash.Today it felt like we were back in the hiking groove to some degree. We try to focus on the positives and while it is a bit more difficult when the weather is lousy or we are feeling tired, there is always something to be grateful for.Here's a quick list of the little things that add up to make a good hiking day:1) The glorious radiance of the sun2) Brannin's hospitality and what he calls synchronicity3) Fresh fruit, bananas for breakfast4) Blue sky and the pines in Harriman SP5) Dry rocks and traction6) Hiking in shorts and shirtsleeves7) A cooling breeze on the ridge8) Plenty of water9) A bear sighting10)The simple joy of hiking.So far we are both liking NY as it reminds us both of the north woods of our home state of Michigan.

We made extra sure it looked undisturbed, although we always are careful that way.We went down a road for a ways, and then it was down the well crafted steps for quite some time with views of the Hudson River here and there. When we got to the bottom we headed over to the Bear Mountain Recreation area. There is a lake there and a playground and a jillion picnic tables. There is also a small sort of zoo that has rehabbed animals in it. When this is open, the AT goes right through it, unfortunately, it was too early so we didn't get to see it.We made our way to the Bear Mountain Bridge.   This is a huge bridge over the Hudson River.   It has a sidewalk along the side. There was a barge floating lazily towards us and the early morning work traffic was flat out flying. When you get to the end of the bridge, there is a sort of Y there with different highways splitting off each way. This is one of the few road crossings that I felt super uncomfortable doing. Not only uncomfortable, but unsafe. Like I said, the morning work traffic is whizzing by and you have to sort of dart out to get across it. One of those above traffic cross ladders would be a really good idea. That seems like an accident waiting to happen to me.After a really steep ascent from the road we hit the forest once more. This area is still very rocky and I am super glad to have new shoes as I travel it. Along the way, we meet a couple and there little short legged dog. They are going southbound.   They started from Kent 7 days ago, which means they are doing about 7 miles a day.

We descended a few hundred feet down to the RPH shelter where we stocked up on water that we got from an old fashioned pump. It was another sunny warm day and the miles passed by easily. We walked through forest, farmlands and swamps. We hiked around the shore of Nuclear Lake. We thought that this was a strange name for a lake but we passed by without incident and neither of us was glowing.We ate our dinner near the boardwalk that crosses Swamp River and then made our way across the train tracks of the Appalachian Trail RR. Then it was an easy walk across some open farmlands that had some Hereford cattle ranging about. That led to a short ascent up to Hammersly Ridge where we called it a day.Today we had less climbing.

On our other long trails it involved two to three states max. Of course California was like 1,400 trail miles so there is a difference there. But now we are walking to and through some states I've never been to so that's kind of exciting. The trail here in the northeast sort of undulates. Now on the edge of one state, now on the edge of another, and the finds itself back in the first state. All within the space of a day sometimes. Today we passed from New York to Connecticut and it was very cool. I like this state. We had a goal of getting in to the town of Kent. We needed to resupply. We hoped to hit an outfitters and a shoe store that sold inserts for my feet. We also hoped to go by the library and take care of some business. We also needed to do laundry really badly, since there was no way to do laundry back in Greenwood Lake, NY. And by now we really stinketh. Oh, and we wanted to hit a restaurant and get something to eat of course. Even with so much to do, we were hoping to maybe hitch back out to the trail and hike a few miles. So, we hiked hard all day and came out on the road that takes you to Kent at around 3:30pm. We stuck out our thumb and didn't have long to wait. A nice gentleman who has section hiked parts of the AT picked us up and gave us a ride to the outfitters. We picked up a few things there and the owner told us some disturbing news. She said that there was a female hiker missing from the Kent area and asked us if we'd seen or heard anything about it.   Apparently the girls backpack was found but no girl. That was not good surely. I said a prayer in my heart for her and her family.We walked into town and went to all the places I mentioned above with a few caveats.   At the library I google the missing girl backpacker in the Kent area and was somewhat relieved? to find out it was a guy dressed girlishly. And the backpack turned out to be a drug drop. So that had a much better ending than what I envisioned when I first heard about it. The other thing was that the laundromat, which had no sign marking it as such, had received some bad visits from some pretty stupid through hikers. We were told by some local business owners that she may or may not let you do your laundry there. We went in and looked for her to be sure it was okay, but no one was there. We didn't want to get kicked out with our clothes half done and sopping wet, so we left. Not smelling like roses.We ate dinner at The Pasta Garden. Now it was getting a bit late because of everything we had done. The resupplying had taken a while too. There was really no place to go so we thought we might hitch back out to the trail. But as we were walking away, a woman called after us. Excuse me are you guys through hikers? When she learned that we were, she asked if she could take our picture. It turns out that she works for the Chamber of Commerce and she keeps a Facebook page. She likes to include the through hikers when they come into town.   We chatted with her for a while and one thing lead to another and soon she was driving us around trying to help us find a place to pitch our tent for the night. She made a bunch of phone calls and finally a business friend of hers had a grassy lot in the back of her store. And that's where we ended up tonight. But for the kindness of strangers we would have been stumbling about in the dark on the trail looking perhaps in vain for a flat spot to camp on. Because according to the trail guide, it was a climb out of the gate. We were so grateful to her for taking the time, and for caring for these stinky, smelly hikers.So, our tent is set up on the lawn.

I'll be glad to tell you all about it if you have a few minutes. You do? Awesome. Well, the first part of the day I didn't really love because we did a lot of road walking. It was a Saturday as you know, and in this area that meant tons of people. Several boy Scout troops were out, which I think is very cool. They get to see what it's like to wander around in the woods and they have the commaraderie of their scouty friends. There were a bunch of week end hikers too which I also think is great.Today we climbed to the highest point in Connecticut.   On the way up we met a guy who called himself the Mayor, because he had climbed to Bear Mountain, the highest point, like 150 times. I guess he must REALLY like the view from there. When we got there, there was a rock observation tower erected long ago and a plaque commerating the spot.The climb down was super steep and rocky. We really had to pick our way down very carefully. Once we were clear of that section, we met a girl named Bugs and her parents. She had hiked the AT in 2006. They were out for a day hike. We chatted with them for a bit before moving on.This next section was a highlight for both of us. The trail passed along beside the Laurel Creek. This creek had deep green mossy rocks, mini waterfalls, deep hidden pools. It was just gorgeous and will probably remain one of our favorite places on the AT. The trail crossed over the Laurel Creek and There on the tree before us was a sign announcing that we had reached the Connecticut Massachusetts border. Yay! Another new state!We then continued to climb up and over Mt. Everett ( not to be confused with Mt. Everest).

Well it's true. It feels so good to be warm and clean and eat 'town food' that some people just never go back out on the trail after a town stay, they just quit and go home. Backpacking light guru Ray Jardine talks about that phenomenon in his book. He says you should get in, get what you need and get out. That the comforts of the town suck people in and it ends their hike.Will and I had a nice hearty breakfast, packed up our stuff and sat in our warm, dry, comfortable room looking at each other.   He said I'm tired and I don't really want to leave town.   I said me neither.   But the only way to finish this hike is to keep on walking, and we do want to finish this hike. So we reluctantly headed out.   We needed to hitch the 4 or 5 miles back out to the trail. But since we were in town with not much room for people to pull over and pick us up it was setting up to be a difficult hitch. Quite a few people passed us on this very busy road, but no one stopped. Until a very nice lady, who, as it turned out, was in the habit of helping AT hikers in need. She is a massage therapist by trade but she loves the outdoors and hiking in it, sometimes taking her dogs. We were so grateful to her for picking us up and taking us back to the trail. Did I mention it was cold and windy and we actually saw some tiny snowflakes? We walked through the forest and then through several open fields. I enjoyed looking at the spring flowers and listening to the birds sing their songs.   But I think my favorite views today were of and on the North Ledges. As you can imagine from the name, the were high ledges made from large sort of rounded rocks.   They were neat looking and they gave some good views of the surrounding forests. We hiked until we came to the Shaker campground.   We called it a day there.   Will went down to the creek to get some water while I stayed in camp and started setting up the tent.

We have never been on any other trail with such ease of entrance into so many towns. Today we had not just one chance to pick up food and stuff our faces while we were at it but TWO. We decided that's our kind of through hiking!And the trail went right through both of them, we didn't have to hitch or do any extra road walking.   But let me start from the beginning.   We got up at our usual time of day and were on the trail by 6am.   We figured we had about 7.5 miles to the first town, Dalton. It was forested walking, uphill and down. The best part about that segment was the fact that we had overestimated the length of it, it was 6 miles. And let me assure you that when there is a discrepancy in mileage it is nearly always longer than we thought, Rarely will it will be shorter.   So that was nice.Dalton is a cool town, with huge houses from by gone years that have double wrap around porches and have been updated and remodeled without changing the air of the era. We loved strolling through town and looking at them. We went to the Cumberland Market and re supplied.   Then it was back on trail, which was still a town walk for some time, until we hit the forest. Along the way we met several pleasant people who wished us well. One of the guys we saw asked if we were through hikers.   We said yes, and he said , not far to go now, you're almost there. To which I replied, I guess, if you want to call over 600 miles almost there. We both laughed.   Then he said, well it's all down hill from here I promise. That's when I jokingly called him a liar. And so it was on our way to the next town. We had the usual forested walking with a lot of both uphill and downhill. There was 10 miles between Dalton and Cheshire and we knocked them off pretty quickly. It was pretty boggy as it has been, but the trail crews do a great job of building plank walkways so you don't have to slog through it. Very impressed with the trail in that aspect.   I liked the town of Cheshire most for its name. It reminds me of the Cheshire cat in Alice in Wonderland.   Well, second most after the food.As we were walking into town and heading towards the convenience store we passed a storage unit complex. A woman hurried towards us calling out, wait a minute, are you through hikers? When we said we were she got so excited! She had hiked a portion of the AT with her two sons. Her son had hiked the whole thing. His trail name was Weedeater, and hers was Elmer (think Elmer glue- she said she is the glue that holds the family together). She kindly offered to let us stay at her home, get cleaned up and do the laundry. Another act of kindness we didn't ask for or expect.   We were blown away. When we asked where here home was and how far it turned out to be 14 trail miles up and over Mt. Greylock in the town of Adams, MA. It was afternoon now and we had already hiked 16 miles. We still had to go to the convenience store and there was the matter of the over 2,500 feet of elevation gain that we had to climb to reach Mt. Greylock. Will regretfully told her we would probably not be able to make that many miles by tonight but we sure did appreciate the offer. As she was leaving she said we had made her day, she had been hoping to see some hikers she might be able to help. Wow! We had made her day? Well maybe we had, but she had definitely made ours with this amazing unsolicited offer of kindness. We walked on to the very touched by this encounter. Had it been less mileage we would have certainly dropped by her house. We resupplied and filled up on food at the store. Then we headed out for the big climb to Mt. Greylock. It was steep and long over several miles. I didn't know anything about Mt. Greylock before we started out. I'd never seen any pictures or read any literature about it. I was expecting the usual flat area with a view of the landscape below. But that was not what I received.   Mt. Greylock is a State Park it turns out. It is the highest point in Massachusetts.   There is a cool lodge right on the summit. There is also this huge, awesome Veterans memorial. It's shaped like a tower and has a really large globe of glass toward the top of it. I guess it was built right after World War I.   We went around the memorial to the lookout area. Here you found 3 large commercial binoculars.   The silver kind you put a quarter in. There was also a panoramic picture of what you were looking at, with everything labeled so you knew what you were seeing. And of course the view was spectacular. It seemed you could see forever. We left there and headed out, picking up the pace as it was now getting late. We had some downhill but also a short climb over Mt. Williams. We pushed on to the Wilbur Clearing Shelter making it there in our headlamps. A long day with two town stops and a cool mountain view eating into our hiking time. Not bad for our age group eh? Lol. Well, as you can imagine, I'm done in so I'll bid you a quick good night. Catch you later ! Road Runner","Warnet Hill

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534891,Last night we set up our tent on a platform at the shelter. Unfortunately even though we were on the platform we still had mice problems. The mice in and around the shelters are one of the reasons we prefer to stealth camp.Last week we tried to cut back on our mileage to make it an easier week and get more rest. It didn't work out that way. But this week we're going to end up taking two rest days. We are hoping that the extra rest will pay off in the long run. The miles have gotten a little tougher lately. We're doing more climbing. As we are heading north we understand that the the trail becomes becomes more rugged through Vermont and New Hampshire. We are trying to give ourselves a chance to get ready for these sections.Today we only had a couple of miles into Williamstown. It was easy hiking and when we reached the road we got a ride from Christina. She took us into Williamstown where are we had booked a room at the Williamstown Motel. We got there by 9 a.m. and we were fortunate enough to be able to check in right away. We enjoyed a nice continental breakfast and then began our chores. They do your laundry at the motel but it is a rather steep charge at $10. We felt it was worth it gave us a little more time to rest.We did have a restful day. We were able to work on our Journal and we did the usual things to go along with the resupply day.Williamstown Motel is Hiker friendly. We enjoyed our stay. Tomorrow we will cross over into Vermont and begin the Long Trail. We both liked Massachusetts.Will,"Wilbur Clearing Shelter

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534821,"Today shouldn't take that long to tell you abouwt. We packed up, ate the breakfast provided by the motel and then headed out to resupply from the local grocer.   We planned to walk there but then thought better of it and went to the bus stop. However our luck with buses from Greenwood, NY held and we sat there quite a while and then ended up missing it anyway.So we walked out to the road and started hitching. Pretty soon a very nice man with a big black friendly dog named Sam stopped to pick us up. I got to sit in the back with Sam and get my dog fix. Went to the store and got our food, yada, yada, yada. And then went out front to try and catch the bus once again. This time to go to the Post Office. Guess what? Got it! Post Office taken care of and then contacted our new good friend Christina to see if she could drive us back to the trail. She had given us her phone numbers yesterday and told us to call if we needed help. She said she liked helping people.   Well, obviously! Because she helped two rather smelly people out yesterday with a ride. She was more than happy to! So we walked over to the nearby Burger King, a hikers got to eat right? She picked us up and drove us back to the trail.   That's a to AND from, I don't think we've ever had one of those before. And we truly appreciated it. Will and I were discussing it later and decided that the people on the trail are what makes this hike so special for us right now.So we started our hiking day in the early afternoon. We walked along with beautiful Creekside. It was narrow and it had the large rocks in it. The water was falling over these rocks in mini waterfalls. With those dark green mossy rocks along the way. I really love this kind of hiking along the riverside. And that's where today's title came from. Remember that old song 'I love the rivers I love the rocks and rolls I love the mountains I love the Rolling Hills I love the fireflies when the lights are low boomdiada boomdiada boomdiada boom boom.'A bunch of uphill again today. Will said it was over three thousand feet before we were done. It took us a while to find a campsite, because the roots and the rocks were prominent. But we finally found one we're camped in here next to the trail. Short hiking day for us but a good one. I'll call it a day. Catch you later Roadrunner","Williamstown, Massachusetts

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534942,This morning we had a gradual descent down to Highway 9. From there we climbed approximately 2500 feet up to the Glastonbury Mountain lookout tower. There was a nice pine forest in this area. We climbed up to the tower and we were above the trees. We had great panoramic views. The skies were gray and it was a cool day asthe winds gusted up top.From the lookout tower we descended to the Kid Gore shelter. We cooked dinner and as we were leaving we saw our first northbound thru hiker in some time. We last saw Padawan in the Smokies . He was coming in to spend the night.We decided to put in a few more miles and hike down to the Story Spring shelter where we found a flat spot to set up camp.We've had warmer temps the last few days and with the warmer temps the black flies have come out. Tonight they were swarming. Still all in a pretty good hiking day. For me the last week or two have been the dog days. We have done a lot of miles but we are still a long way from being through. Just have to try and stay in the moment and remember that the 'journey is the destination' . So far we have been enjoying the Long Trail.Will,"Consultation Peak

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534955,"Before I talk about today's journey, I want to give a quick mention of something that happened yesterday. Yesterday we met a young man, his name is Vince and this was his first day on the trail. He's doing a section hike from Vermont to Maine and he was so excited. Excitement just kind of hung around him like halo. Everything he saw was just wonderful and amazing. He was wearing a really cool green shirt and several times during the day, we would pass him he would pass us, this is called leap frog in hiker speak . So it came to me what his trail name should be. Kermit! I rarely name anyone on the trail. I maybe have suggested names for one or two other people. Our good friend Elevator is one of them. You can only suggest a trail name, you don't give it to someone, they decide whether they will take it. The next time we passed Kermit I told him what I thought his trail name should be and why, and he said he loved it. So Kermit he is. And now I feel like a trail name fairy godmother. Lol. Today would be a very social day as hiking days go for Will and I. The first person we bumped into was the caretaker for the fire tower at the Stratton Lookout. We had climbed up to the fire tower this morning and we're going over the back side. Apparently he's been the caretaker since 1963, that's an amazingly long time.The next people we bumped into were three guys doing some trail maintenance. We thanked them for all the hard work that they did on the trail and then chatted about the trail and also about our journey so far.We walked along encountering a few weekend hikers as we went. We stopped at a shelter to take second break. There were several people inside, trying to decide whether they wanted to go out and hike in the rain or not. Among them were three people. It appeared to be two brothers and one of the brother's wife. One of them appeared to have some knowledge of backpacking. The other one was definitely a newbie. This was his first longer hike. They plan to be out for about 10 days but he had stuffed everything but the kitchen sink into his pack. It weighed over 55 pounds. And he was not having very much fun at all. We took a few minutes to try to encourage him. We told him about a few things you could do to lighten his pack and a book he might read. I rarely do that kind of thing but he seemed extremely miserable. As we left it seem like he was a little bit brighter about the prospects of hiking.From there we hiked hard until we got to the turn off point for ManChester Center. Our plan was to try to go into town pick up some food for resupply go somewhere to eat and then if possible get back out and Hike the trail a couple more miles. It was raining, it was nasty and we weren't sure people would want to stop and pick us up.But we only stood by the road for maybe 3 or 4 minutes and a nice young man picked this up. He said we were the third group of people he had taken into town in the last week or two. Very cool. We went to the Outfitters got what we needed there, went to the grocery store got what we needed there, then went to McDonald's and ate a bunch of food.We decided to try and make it out of town. What we have found as we have been hitchhiking these many years is that as it gets darker or later people don't want to stop and give you a ride. Who could blame them? But again we were very fortunate. After about 5 minutes a couple in a van pulled over and told us to hop in. They themselves had hiked a good portion of the AT,They dropped us off at the traihead with plenty of time to hike a couple of miles. So we hiked up to the Bromley shelter and set our tent up on the wooden platforms they have there. At least it's level.All in all we feel it was a very good day in terms of getting things done. It can be very difficult to get in and out of a resupply town on the same day. Depending on how quickly you're hitching goes.So we are on a little wooden platform in a little tent and all settled in for a good night's sleep. Catch you later!Road Runner","Story Spring Shelter

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534972,"Yesterday was kind of a gnarly day for hiking, a lot of rain, dead trees, stunted forest. Today it was the polar opposite. It was a perfect hiking day. Blue sky, sunshine, warm, cool breeze, lakes and healthy pine forest.We left the shelter in the cool of the morning and climbed through the forest to Bromley Mt where we had some nice views.Then we descended to Mad Tom Notch, then back up about a 1000 feet to Styles and Peru peaks. We dropped down to Griffiths Lake and then had a short steep climb to Baker peak.From there it was easy hiking down to Lost Pond shelter. We cruised into Little Rock Pond which is actually a big beautiful lake. We walked along its shores in the midday heat enjoying the shade of the tall pines which dot the lakeshore.We stopped at Greenwall shelter for dinner where we met Bear Bait another NoBo thru who had started in Georgia.   He explained that he got his trail name due to his penchant for spilling food on himself. Whereupon he gave a demonstration. He tipped his jetboil with rice and spam all over the picnic table and himself. Thus Bear Bait.We finished dinner dropped down to Vt140. We then climbed to Bear Mt and called it a day. The only drawback today was the blackflies. They were out in full force. We picked up some Repel Lemon Eucalyptus at EMS yesterday. It is pretty effective as long as we keep applying it frequently.   Plus we smell good. We are cowboy camping tonight.   It is probably the warmest night we have had. An owl is out there hooting. It kept getting closer and then finally flew over about 20 feet away. Beautiful night, warm, bright moonlight through the trees.Will","Bromley Shelter

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534990,"This morning we came out of our campsite on Bear Mountain. We traveled all the way down the mountain, but we didn't see any of the bear that give it its name.We took our first break at the Clarendon Gorge suspension bridge. It was a nice flat spot beneath the Pines there. The river and a suspension bridge that was really beautiful. You can stand in the middle of it and watch the soft waterfalls work their way towards you.Of course it was a steep uphill from there. There were a couple of places we were hoping to stop and get our groceries or meal. One was the Pierce groceries on Old River Road and the other was Cooper Lodge on the summit. There's a great restaurant with a view. But this was not open for the season yet. We were a bit disappointed but weren't too surprised that it wasn't open this early.Of course it started raining like crazy about midway through the morning and continued pretty much throughout the day. We climbed up to the Cooper Lodge shelter. We decided to get out of the rain and take a quick break, get a few warmer clothes on as we were starting to get cold from the rain. There were a couple of hikers already there trying to keep dry. We ate a quick sandwich changed our clothes and headed on.This was supposed to be the downhill portion of the day but it turned out to be some uphill and then downhill. Made much slower by the extreme slipperiness of the rocks and the roots that were wet from the day-long rain.When we finally got to the bottom of the mountain and we're standing out by the highway. We had a very small percentage left on phone battery and so we made some quick phone calls. We had decided on the way down from the mountain that if we could get a room we would duck out of the rain for the night. The first place we called the Inn by the trail, was closed for renovations. The second one we called couldn't check us in until 9 p.m. . It was only 7 p.m. when we called. That took care of our phone battery. So we decided to Hitch into Killington and see if the lodge there had openingsIt was getting late again and the cars just passed us by. But we were taken totally by surprise when a young girl walked up behind us and asked us if we needed a ride. Her name was Brightside she had hiked the AT last year and she had been walking on the AT for a little evening stroll. She drove us into town.From there we found our way to the Mountain Meadow Lodge. Not only did they have have a room available for us, they also had an amazing dinner. Even though it was pretty much closing time for their kitchen. We of course inhaled that in no time flat all the while raving about the quality of the food.As we had been standing out by the road trying to hitch earlier in the evening in the cold wet chill almost night. Will turned to me and said, all's well that ends well. And I said, huh? What are you talking about. He said it's all going to work out. And I have to say that he was very right. This is the best place that we could have been. Situated on a lake it's a huge lodge with all sorts of amenities. But mostly it just feels like home.So I'm warm and clean and dry.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535639,"Ahhhhh, Spring has sprung! And so have the black flies. They are all around you as you hike each day. Fortunately for us, Kermit told us about a repellent called Repel. It has no deet. The main ingredients are Lemmon and eucalyptus oil. We picked some up and it has been working pretty well. Since we all know deet is very caustic, it can even eat through plastic, it's nice not to have to use it.My sister Brenda appreciates the hard bite of the black fly.   She still wears the scar she got on her arm from a black fly bite and Canada. We left the Mountain Meadows Lodge early this morning as usual. We were well satisfied with our zero day, and felt rested and glad to be out hiking again. Which was good because it was a very tough day climbing. We took our lunch break at a cabin called the Lookout. It is a private cabin. But they open it up to hikers. It has a loft and floor space for sleeping. It also has a great front porch. All they ask is that you keep it clean and do not start a fire in the fireplace. There is a ladder on the side of the cabin and a platform at the very top. From there you can see a great view. Hence the name for the Lookout. We ate our lunch on the porch since it was cooler there. It was a nice, quiet relaxing place to rest and eat. And we mentioned several times how very very nice it was of the owners to open it up to the hiking public.We stopped at a shelter to get some water. There was a gentleman there. He said he was not a hiker, but that he just wanted to get away for a few days and enjoy the outdoors. So, the life of leisure for him. He hiked 3.8 miles and then quit for the day. If only!We knew there was a little store called the Edge of the Farm up ahead. According to our sources it was only open until 5pm. We decided to make a run for it. The specialty there is homemade pie and you can have ice cream with it! Need I say more? Of course we made it to the Edge of the Farm before it closed. We split a blueberry peach crisp pie. With which we topped with a pint of ice cream. Oh, and that was after we ate a sandwich. I felt very sick when we finished it, but finish it we did.On our way back to the trail we met a very nice man named Dan Quinn. For the last 23 years he has opened up his barn slash hay loft as a place for hikers to stay. He calls it the AT House. He has very simple rules no partying and no cooking up in the loft. He told us he only lets the good people stay there. And he doesn't have any problem giving someone the boot. So if you're looking for a place to get rowdy, pass this one by.We waddled up the trail. Of course it was immediately a steep up hill. It's tough to do that when you are so full of pie that you cannot even breathe. But somehow we managed. We put in another four miles or so. Now we're camped off the trail a fair ways. We're on a nice soft hill with lots of leaves to cushion us for the night.   The birds are singing oh so sweetly in the trees.   So I must away to bed.

I will take the warmer mornings any day over those cold bone chilling mornings. So nice to get started in shorts and short sleeve shirts even though we were sweating as if we were hiking in a sauna.Today we had a little bit of everything. We walked through farmland and forests and then had a road walk through West Hartford. As we were walking the road a car pulled up next to me and the driver asked if I was Will. Indeed.The driver was none other than Bobbie the 'Hat Lady'. Bobbie works for social service in the area and keeps an eye out for hikers. She passes out candy bars to hikers. We had a short but sweet conversation. She gave me a couple of candy bars. Many thanks Bobbie.We then proceeded to the General Store which had reopened after being closed for a couple of years. This was a pleasant surprise.   We had a hot dog, pop, chocolate chip cookie and Toll House ice cream sandwich. We then climbed in the heat through the woods before starting our next road walk which would lead us eventually into Hanover. We walked down Elm Street and found a cooler in front of Betsy and Bill's home that was filled with Watermelon and Banana bread filled with chocolate chips. Thanks, a great treat in the soaring temps.We passed some beautiful homes as we hiked into Norwich, a nice little town. We went to the general store to see if we could score one of their free day old subs but came up empty handed.A long road walk took us on a bridge over the Connecticut river and the Vt/NH border. We made it to Hanover home of Dartmouth College.   The temp wax over 90, the heat noise and cars got to me. I was irritable. Sensory overload. It was too much after walking through the peaceful and tranquil forest. What a contrast.We hit a few stores, got some pizza at Ramuntos including a freebie. Hiker friendly place. We walked in and one of the staff yelled out 'hikers here'. They had our free pizza ready for us. We didn't even have to ask.We picked up some food at the co-up and then climbed up to the Velvet Rocks shelter. No water at the shelter. It was hot. Never really cooled down all night. I was sweaty and clammy. I had a restless night.So it was goodbye to Vermont which we loved and on into New Hampshire.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536004,"Before I tell you about my day, I want to talk to you about something. For some reason, on this Trail, Will and I are running into something we've never run into before. What is it? Well, people don't think that we are really through hikers. Usually it runs like this. We ask them where they are hiking. They tell us. Then they ask us where we started. And we say Georgia. Either their eyes get really big and they say I thought you were out for the weekend. You don't look like thru-hikers. When you ask them why we don't look like thru-hikers they say it's because we are too clean.We actually had one woman say no way! You're not thru hikers. You're not dirty enough. At first I took it as sort of a compliment. We are somehow staying cleaner than the average hiker. But after about the 9th or 10th time, I started feeling a little slighted.Or maybe defensive.   Like I need to pull out my phone and show them my Trail Journals diary to prove we really started in Georgia. Which is silly I know. Whether I look like a thru hiker or I look like a day hiker or Weekender, I'm still a thru hiker. I don't know, maybe I should get down on the ground and roll around in the dirt a little bit so I could be a real thru hiker.It was so hot last night. It never really did cool off. Will and I both woke up well before our usual time. So we decided to go ahead and get up and hit the trail even earlier. We were on trail by 5 a.m. this morning. We were also thirsty since there was no water at this shelter. We hiked for half a mile or so and came to the turn off for the water source.   Sometimes the water is right on trail and sometimes you have to hike a while to get to it. We try and avoid the off trail mileage whenever we can, but this morning it was a neccesity.   Turned out to be a really nice spring that had a clean, covered cistern to collect the water. Ice cold and you can drink it straight up without treating it. Now that's what I'm talking about. You know how I told you we were like little chipmunks stuffing the extra miles in our cheeks for tough travel in the White Mountains? Well, we are now in them. Sort of on the fringes. I'm sort of waiting to see if I agree with all the hype about their difficulty or not.As the day progressed the heat really ramped up. So we were glad when we got to the turn off for Bill Ackerlys house. Bill is 85 and is known as the 'Ice Cream Man' as he gives every one who passes by an ice cream bar. He also provides water, a place to charge their phone, a place to rest in the shade. He provides a place to pitch your tent, free of charge if you need to. He plays a mean game of croquet and places a sign taunting you to even attempt to beat him at it at the turn off. His life has been a labor of love for the hikers. I was really looking forward to meeting him. But it was not to be, for when we reached the turn off to Bills house there was a large poster with his picture on it announcing his death just a few days earlier.We still went up to the house and got a ice cream bar and some water. Rested in the shade and signed the hiker register. Thanks for everything Bill. Some people live their lives selfishly and some people change the world by giving themselves away. Bill was a world changer. Just ask any hiker who knew him.We left Bills feeling refreshed and made our way up the very steep, rocky uphill to the Fire Tower on Smarts Mountain. The wardens cabin has been made into a shelter. There were 5 or 6 other hikers there. All section hikers in various stages of their journey. Several had only been out a couple of days.   We made our dinner there then climbed the fire tower for an amazing view. After that we went to the Smarts Tent Camping area and set up our tent. We're pretty high up here and the tent spaces are near the slope, plus we have a breeze so it should be comfortable for sleeping temperature wise. So, I'm calling it a night. Catch you later!

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536011,"We started our hiking day with a descent down to South Jacobs Brook. After climbing over 5000 feet yesterday, it was a good way to start. The climbing and 93 degree temps zapped us and neither one of us was feeling like pushing hard today.We had mostly forested walking today and it was a continuation of the beautiful forests that we had yesterday.   Big pines and firs with nice shade and little undergrowth to give a nice feeling of openness.The shade was most welcome. It was at least 10-15 degrees cooler in the forest. Although it wasn't as hot as yesterday we still were dripping with sweat on the climbs.We had a nice climb up to Mt Cube our high point of the day at around 3000 feet. We dropped down to NH25A and then climbed up to Ore Hill and finally Mist Mt at 2200 feet. A little nub in the trees.We are heading into the meat of the White Mts with our first big climb tomorrow. The Whites have been the big 'carrot' that everyone has been dangling in front of us. 'Wait til you get to the Whites'. For some it is the crown jewel of the AT. We have been told that the miles come hard. Well, we have squirreled away our miles, so we plan to cut back on our pace and hopefully enjoy the ridges and peaks.The southbounders and weekenders that we have been meeting tell us 'you are almost there'. 400 miles doesn't quite feel like almost there. But I do remember telling someone when we had around 750 miles to go that it didn't seem that far. Sounds like something only a thruhiker would say.It is supposed to rain tonight. A young lady heading south looking fresh and clean after a stop at the hostel recommended a stay at the Hiker Welcome Hostel.We checked it out and got the last two beds. I am heading into town to get some food and after a good night's sleep we will tackle the 4000 foot climb up to Mt Moosalaukie in the morning. Heading into the Whites ready or not.We will be starting our 4th month in a few days and we are projecting a June 24th finish. Not etched in stone but we have to be back in Arizona by July 1st.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536006,"We got a late start from the Hikers Welcome hostel this morning.   6:20 instead of 6am, lol. We hit the trail made a quick pit stop early and were joined by an unwanted hiker. I spotted him right away. It was a tick. Riding along on Wills hiking shorts. I gave him a flick. (Rhymes with tick). The score is 9 to 0 by the way. I have found 9 ticks and Will has found 0. Six on him, three on me. My three were just riding along. But two of his were starting to embed. The first one I found just had a couple legs waving around outside. That's how I noticed it. It looked like a very small piece of dirt with flailing legs. I pulled it out with tweezers. It hadn't started engorging yet. Local people have been sternly warning us about the ticks and we have been doing thorough nightly checks. But I'll tell you, it gives you the Heebie Jeebies when you find them. Especially when they are waving at you. But seriously, if you don't catch them early they can transmit Lyme's disease.   And that is a potentiality debilitating condition. We sent our clothes out to be treated with a tick solution, Permethrin. But 9 ticks later I'm not sure it's working. If you are planning to hike this trail, make sure you check for them!Anyway, enough of that. We had been told the climb up Moosalaukie Mountain wasn't too bad. Well maybe it was the migraine I had, or maybe it was the fact that the person who told me that was slack packing (tiny day pack) but I thought it was tough enough. We worked really hard to get there only to find the mountain totally socked in a thick white mist. So the view to effort reward was really poor.However, the same person who got it wrong about the uphill, told me that the downhill was super steep and difficult.   Spot on for that one. It took us forever to go down this mountain. Not only was it boulder filled and steep, it had rained hard so it was super slippery. Will and I both slipped and fell a couple times going down it. But it was so steep they literally anchored wooden steps into the rockfaces in places to help you get down. When we made it down to the parking lot we took a little break to reevaluate. It had taken us eight hours to go about ten miles. It doesn't take a math major to figure out that that's slow! Do we push on or hitch into town from here. We are now a bit low on food since we planned to be moving along a bit quicker. But this is the Whites right?   We choose to keep hiking. The terrain is still tough but not quite as tough as the front part of our day. We make it into the shelter before dark and set up camp on a nice level area. That is when I find tick number 10 attached to the back of my upper calf. The first attachment for me. Ugh. So now the score is 10 to 0. But I would really like to stop playing this 'game'.

My shoes stink from walking through the mud, muck and bog. It was get your climbing shoes on right from the git go as we left the shelter.2000 feet up, sometimes straight up to the top of South Kinsman Mt where we had exquisite panoramic views of the surrounding mountains. We stopped for break up top enjoying the cool mountain air.We dipped down and then ascended to North Kinsman peak and that was it for our climbing for the day. From the peak we dropped down and passed a shelter and then found ourselves at our first hut. Lonesome Lake Hut by the Fishin Jimmy trail. We stopped in and were greeted by a friendly group of young employees who were going through orientation. A pretty good place to spend a summer. There is a nice lake below the hut and bunkhouse.We got some lemonade and candy bars and then took the AT toward Franconia Notch. There was a sign warning us that the bridge was out over Cascade Brook and could present a problwem in high water. It was no big deal as we rock hopped the brook.Easy hiking had us down at the notch in no time and we crossed under the xway and took the paved path to US 3 where the second car by stopped to pick us up and take us to McDonalds in Lincoln. We got a burger and frappe and called the Autumn Breeze motel in N Woodstock.Ann the owner said that she would pick us up in an hour after we did our chores.Any hikers reading this should check this place out. The best value on the AT so far. A clean room with two beds, refridge, microwave, shuttle, complimentary beverage and laundry for $60 including tax. Love it.Picked up a Golden Monkey Belgian ale at Wayne's next door. They have over 900 brewskis in store and am now in hog heaven. We went out to dinner at the N Woodstock Inn.

Makes you feel very welcome.She dropped us off in town so we could eat and go to the library and hit a few more shops for some things we found we needed. Then we walked back to Woodstock. Picked up a sub for dinner and just relaxed.

We had great views of the surrounding peaks under clear blue skies.We climbed another 800 feet along the ridge to Little Haystack Mt where we met a family of four with two young children out for the day climbing 4000 footers. They were trying to climb all 48 in NH. Today was number 11 and 12. They pointed out the names of the surrounding peaks.From Haystack we dipped down before ascending a few hundred feet to the top of Mt Lincoln.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536919,"I hope you don't mind if I go backwards a little bit before we talk about today. You know that family of four that Will told you about yesterday? Well, what he didn't tell you was that as we chatted with them and they asked about our hike, the mom told us that her youngest son had dreams of someday hiking the AT. I guessed him to be about 10 or 11 years old. As we were leaving, I said to him, hold on to your dreams of hiking the AT, there are boys out there not that much older than you hiking this trail.We hiked on a while and took our break at a saddle. While we were there the family passed by us. I began thinking. I have been carrying the AT patch that the ATC sent us when we pre registered for the trail. I put it on at home in Arizona and had never taken it off. So at this point I had carried it about 1,825 miles. I had planned to take a picture of it on my pack when we reached the northern terminus in Maine and send it to the ATC at Harpers Ferry. But another idea entered my head as I sat at break. If we caught up to this family, I would give it to the youngest son with a dream to hike the AT.We finished our break and we did catch up with them at the summit. I took the patch off my pack and sat down by the boy who was seated by himself. I explained what the patch was and how long I had carried it and told him I was giving it to him. That when he was old enough, if he hiked the AT he was to attach it to his pack and carry it all the way to Mt. Katahdin. His eyes got huge with wonder. It was a small gesture but a priceless moment. His mom had been listening in and said, you've started something now! I truly hope so. She took our picture together   It felt like I was Passing on the Torch for the love of long distance hiking. As I was leaving I asked him his name. William. The same as my grandsons.But now, today. Kind of a rough one for me. I had fallen towards the end of the hiking day yesterday and fallen with all my weight on my right knee. Super painful and giving me problems today. We had to pull out the big guns in our pain meds to keep me going.   We started out with a descent to the Zealand Falls Hut. We stopped in to the hut for a moment and picked up a piece ginger cake. When we came back outside to hike we were given a few bum steers for directions and wandered around for a little bit. But soon we were back on the trail and made our way past the Ethan PondThat's when we had a nice relatively flat stretch of Trail. We Savor these moments because we don't get them very often. We followed this into a descent into Crawford notch. We stuck out our thumb to go resupply the General Store. We were soon picked up by a nice gentleman and his wife. He did Trail maintenance. The General Store however was a total bust. We would not suggest that you resupply there if you're coming through. Very expensive and nothing to buy. Hitch back to the trail was pretty easy as well we were picked up by former thru-hikers Rambo and Tiny Giant. Very nice of themNext it was a very steep ascent to the Webster cliffs. The views were awesome from there. Then it was more steep boulder hand-to-hand rock climbing up Mount Webster and finally to Mount Jackson. We were thinking of continuing on to the Hut but we were pretty wiped out by then. There was a small clearing at the top of Mount Jackson and we pitched our tent there. Didn't look like much to start with but it turned out to be a nice spot. With a great sunset.So we're hunkered down here for the night. I guess I'll turn in.

We hiked through the Presidential range. It was spectacular. We started out under blue skies. It was an easy hike from Mt Jackson to the Mizpah Spring hut. We stopped to fill our water bottles and shared a piece of carrot cake.Climbing from the hut, we hiked over Mt Clinton, passed the Eisenhower loop, climbed over Mt Franklin before arriving at Lake of the Clouds hut. This was situated in a beautiful bowl under Mt Washington. We had a bowl of spinach basil tomato soup. Very good. By this time the wind had picked up and was whipping on us. After another pastry, we climbed up to Mt Washington.  Mt Washington is the high point in the Whites. At the top there is a big center with snack bar. More food. If you don't want to hike to the summit one can ride a train or even drive to the top. Go figure, It was windy and cold.   Being a Saturday the summit was packed.We headed down from the summit on our way to the Madison hut. We ran into Scorched Heels. We last saw him back in N Carolina. Some of the younger stronger hikers are catching up to us as our pace has slowed.The trail to the hut undulated. It was up and down with some hiking through boulders. We were in the middle of a beautiful wilderness surrounded by the mountains. We reached the hut and spoke with the caretaker and one of the seasonal volunteers. I asked about the upcoming trail and they warned us about an upcoming storm that was forecasted to dump up to 2 inches of rain. They said that tomorrow might be a good day for a rest day.We climbed from the hut to the summit of Mt Madison.   We had great views. Hikers were ascending to and descending from the summit. Trails went off in several directions. We began the long steep descent over talus down to the Osgood tent sites. The descent seemed to go on forever in the late afternoon sunlight. We reached treeline and left the talus behind.The steep descent continued through the trees. We finally arrived at the tent sites in the fading light.

We still hadn't decided whether to resupply and keep going or hunker down for the 2"" of rain people kept warning us about. We walked into the very hiker friendly lodge and were warned again about the heavy rains by the trail info guy there. That did it for Will. We called Paul at the Barn hostel in Gorham,NH. Not only did he have room for us, he picked us up! Scorched Heels came along after we called so we took him along with us.This turned out to be a very good plan all the way around because it did indeed rain, hard. And the next section is treacherous enough when it's dry but crazy treacherous wet we are told. Plus, it's a nice hostel. You get a free shuttle to and from the trail if you stay two nights, you get a $2.00 shuttle to Walmart to resupply and food is within walking distance. A very good vibe here.We got everything done here that we needed to. Will and I have discussed it. With the injury to my knee not really improving(hard to do when you are jumping down boulders all the time), I may stay here and rest it, while he hikes this section.

Today she finally decided to take a day off from hiking. We are hoping that with yesterdays short day and today's zero she will be able to continue.I decided to Fastpack the 20 miles between Pinkham Notch and US 2. Fastpacking is somewhere between carrying a full pack and slackpacking. I carried my gear and one day of food. It might be a matter of semantics and I don't have anything against others slackpacking. But I don't want to slackpack unless it becomes absolutely necessary.   I think slackpacking is more common on the AT with all the hostels than it is out west where we do most of our hiking.Paul drove Scorched Heels and myself to Pinkham Notch and we were on trail by 6:15. We were off in the fog. The trail was a creek today. We got our heavy rain with probably upward of an inch and a half accumulation. The trail was initially flat as I hiked around Lost Pond. Then it was straight up and up and up to multiple Wildcat Peaks. The last topping out at around 4500 feet. The sun burned off the clouds, there were good views down into the canyon. From the peak it was a quick drop down to the Carter hut which sat between two small alpine lakes. I stopped in to check out the hut and sample a bowl of turkey soup. Then it was a quick steep ascent up to Carter Dome a lot of climbing early on in the hike.I gained the ridgeline and the trail moderated with only two more climbs of any significance: N Carter and Mariah Mts. There was a long gradual descent down to Hwy2. I made it back to the hostel in time for a late dinner of lasagna from Mr. Pizza. Tough hiking with lots of climbing. I am beat. RR had a good rest day.

The start of this morning's hike was very nice. I guess it's all relative, but this seems to be smooth uphills with good tread on a nice trail.For the first couple of Miles anyway. After that it was back to super steep uphill with very large boulders and a lot of hand climbing. While we were in the Whites and now as we head to Maine, the trail follows old streams beds. You're walking on Old waterways for the AT Trail. This can be very dangerous. Especially after it rains . The rocks on these waterways get very slippery. And I'm not talking A flat river bed, these are mountains and the streams went extremely steeply downhill, or if you're traveling the other way, up hill. About halfway through our hike today Scorched Heels caught up with us. The next couple of days are said to be the hardest on the whole Trail. We are going through the Mahoosuc Notch. And Scorched Heels has been getting mentally prepared for this.Not too far before we hit the Carlos Col shelter, we came to the New Hampshire Maine border. This was very exciting for me. We had entered our final state on the Appalachian Trail. About 280 miles to go. Although the front end of those miles are very difficult as I mentioned. There has been very little in the way of spaces to stealth camp the last few days. So we kept hiking until we hit the shelter. It took all day until about 7 p.m. to hike 17 miles.

We had a good first day out of Gorham. We spent the night at Carlo Col shelter. It poured that night with high winds. We camped on the tent platform and some of our gear got wet. We slept in and got a later than usual start for us.We only had to climb about 700 feet to hit the high point at Goose Eye Mt but it was a nasty hike. The planks through the bog were under water and we were almost lifted off the peak by 70 mph winds. I have never experienced wind like that.We reached the shelter and decided to dry out our gear.

We 'slept in' then ate what was left of our food supply. Which wasn't very much let me tell you, and we were on half rations the night before. We had three options, try and go forward, try and go backward or if we could do neither, then we must call 911. I should say right here that Will is one of those people that instead of making a mountain out of a molehill, makes a molehill out of a mountain. But I am firmly determined to call 911 if I have to, there are no more let's wait and see moments left, either he hikes out on his own two feet this morning or he gets carried out. We decided to have Will put on his pack and walk around camp to see if he could hike. He did and he seemed a bit better. So now, show time. He decided that he would give going forward another try.Mind you, he has been super sick and we are getting ready to go through the Mahoosuc Notch and the Mahoosuc Arm today. This is considered the very toughest day of the AT by many. Certainly by the guidebook we're using, and my illness weakened husband will need to really pull out the stops to get through this.Which is what happened. The Mahoosuc Notch is that huge jumble of car sized boulders. You have a lot of jumping and climbing and squeezing between rocks. But when we finished it, we both thought it was more time consuming than hard. Will did amazingly well on that.   Then it was on to the Mahoosuc Arm climb. This was very steep as promised but again, no more so than other things we've done on this hike. We reached the top and were going over when we bumped into three women and their two dogs out for a hike. They had one car at one end of the trail and another at the trailhead we were coming out at, Grafton Notch. When they learned we were thuhiking they offered us a ride if they were in the parking lot when we came off the trail. While we thought it was super nice of these women to make this offer, we thought the chances that it would work out were pretty slim.We hiked on and came to Speck Pond.   The skies had been looking increasingly threatening and sure enough it started to rain. We stopped to put on our pack covers and rain gear. While we were doing that, who do you think came hiking up the trail towards us? It was Kermit!! Remember I had been his trail name godmother? We hadn't seen him since way back in Vermont. I had just asked Will a couple of days ago how he thought Kermit was doing. And now here he was! Pretty cool. We caught up on a few things and told him about Will being sick. When he found out that we were totally out of food he gave us each a bagel and some granola. How kind! This really helped us crank up our energy level to make it out to Grafton Notch.As we headed toward the Notch I started to notice that i was experiencing some of the symptoms Will had complained about. Sore throat, very hot with chills and a general feeling of weakness. Well, share and share alike I guess. We came out at Grafton Notch and headed to the road to hitch into Bethel.   Bethel is a 17 mile hitch so it can be a bit tough to get a ride. The sky was getting dark and it looked like it might rain,again.   There was very little traffic, but what cars there were just passed us by. I was starting to wonder if we were going to have to pitch our tent with no food to eat, when a young couple pulled up. They were camping for the weekend. They weren't even planning on going into Bethel tonight, but they saw we had a need and decided to help us out. And boy did we really appreciate it! !They dropped us off in the middle of town, near the restaurants, grocery store and motels. We got a room at the Bethel Village Motel. By this time I am dead on my feet. I get cleaned up and get in bed while Will gets us a pizza.

But when we asked which he would recommend, he said neither. He talked it over with Ruth and the next thing we knew he was handing us his car keys and telling us to drive down the road to a very good restaurant called tht Hub. Let someone you don't really know drive off with your car just to be nice and help them out? Not going to happen every day. Wow, we were blown away. And very grateful. The meal was fantastic too. We got the groceries that we needed and then walked the several blocks to the highway.I'm thinking that this was one of the toughest hitches we had on this trail. We stood there for about a half an hour watching the cars go by. There was plenty of traffic but no one would stop and pick us up. Finally, two college age girls pulled over and offered us a ride. As it happened, they were on their way to Grafton Notch for a day hike. They had never met thru hikers before and we're happy to meet us. We were super glad that they were willing to give us a lift.

Not really where you want to be in those conditions.   The tread on my shoes was just about worn off after 560 miles or so. It was very scary going down that wet, slick, steep rock face with no ability to grip the rock let me tell you.   But we did get down it.We hiked on until we got to the Frye Notch Lean to.

Yesterday we got caught in a squall on our descent down from Baldpate wet peak. RR was having a great deal of difficulty on the wet slickrock. It was obvious that her footwear was inadequate for the terrain and conditions. Our first order of business was to get to Andover over to see if we could get a ride to an outfitter in Rangeley. We went to Pine Ellis hostel in Andover but the shuttle would be over 50 miles and not doable at this time. So we would have to continue on trail to Rangeley. We had a good weather forecast in our favor so hopefully that meant drier trails and better traction.We got a shuttle back to the trail and enjoyed a cool afternoon of hiking under blue skies.

We made it by 4:45am.We also need to try and get me some new hiking shoes before I break my neck on some steep, slippery downhill rockface. I injured my knee by falling on it with all my weight on a boulder a couple of weeks ago you may remember. But we had a bit of a road walk around Andover and this has really made my knee angry.   Along with the maximum doses daily of Ibuprofen that I was already taking, I've had to resort to a daily hefty strength pain killer which we carry for emergencies.   Not a really bright thing to do I know, as it can cause you to injure your knee worse with the pain masked. The uphill is not too bad, it's the downhill on rock that I have to jump down and put my weight on the joint that's killer. But, I'm limping constantly and I can feel Wills upset growing. He has told me several times that if everything that happened to me had happened to him, he would have quit the trail long ago. Yeah, right.So we pushed really hard all day.

Not a lot of traffic going our way, hmmmmm. But the 2nd or 3rd car that came along stopped and picked us up! A very nice gentleman on a work vacation training time. He got us into Rangeley by 4pm! He dropped us off at the post office. Talk about service.That was the good news, the bad news was that our packages weren't there. Oh well. I went to the outfitters and was able to be fitted for some shoes which Will bought for me as a belated birthday present. Then we called Stacey at the Farmhouse. She picked us up and we got a private room there. Once we were cleaned up she took us and two other hikers back into town so we could get some supper. Then picked us up at the time appointed. We really enjoyed our stay there and definitely recommend it for anyone hiking by there.That pretty much does it for me. I am exhausted. So I think I'll turn in. Catch you later!

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538647,"We had a nice stay at the Farmhouse and a good dinner at Sarge's. After resupplying at the local IGA we got a ride from Stacy back to the trail. The woods were cool and there was a nice breeze. We had a gentle climb to Eddy pond and then the trail steepened on the way up to Saddleback Mt. The mountain had a broad round peak from which we had nice panoramic views. The wind was gusting and it got chilly fast. We had an easy descent and then another climb up to the Horn. The descent was very steep and although RR's new shoes were a big help, it was still slow going given the condition of her knee. I would say that she was only able to move half speed on the downhill because of the pain. But she is tough and hanging in there. She gets an A for effort.We climbed Saddleback Junior. Then we descended down to Oberton stream, crossed the stream and set up camp. Today was one of our better days of hiking. Great views. Big climbs. A sense of the surrounding Maine Wilderness.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538648,"This morning was climbing time. We left our campsite near the creek. It got chilly last night and the chill continued into the early morning.   We warmed up fast and were shedding layers fast as we started our climbs. We climbed about 1600 feet to Lonesome Mt but there were no views as the peak was covered in with trees.Up up and higher we climbed reaching Spaulding Mt. We traversed toward Sugarloaf and came upon a plaque commemorating the formal completion of the AT. We had a steep descent to the Carravasett river. We crossed the river and met a family with a 14 month old camping on the north side. We began a long climb to South Crocker Mt, dipped down and then climbed North Crocker. We had a 5 mile gradual descent down to Maine 27. Today we ran into about 10 SoBo thruhikers. On our way down to the road we passed the 2000 mile marker. It was noted by a sign made out of branches laid out immaculately on the ground.   We both were kind of taken by surprise and we took a moment to reflect on hiking 2000 long hard miles.We reached the road, stuck out our thumb and a nice lady and her pet boxer drove us to the Stratton motel. We had 3 packages waiting for us including a new phone, ground sheet and two pair of Injinji socks. My feet will be especially thankful.We picked up a pizza and talked with the southbounders. One more big climb and then the trail gets more moderate. We are under 200 miles to go. Now it is starting to sink in. Everyone has been telling us lately, 'you are almost there'. Almost there.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538842,"There comes a point when even the Uber hard headed and determined hiker with a high tolerance for pain must throw in the towel. The realization that I could not continue hiking through the pain as well as risk permanent damage to my knee came last night after I hobbled to our room. I decided to 'sleep on it '. However that was a misnomer because I couldn't sleep at all last night.When Will woke up I had to break the news. You can imagine I was weeping as I did so. To be within 190 miles of finishing and then to have to abruptly end your hike is agonizing.   We tried to think of ways that he could continue and finish. We were out of spare days. The chipmunks cheeks were empty so we couldn't just lay low and see if the knee would get better. If he went forward and I couldn't hike, that left me hanging out at Shaws for somewhere for like 9 days which he was not willing to do.He was a bit shell shocked by my announcement, and then a bit down. But he rallied and took care of getting our flights home and researching getting us to the airport.   I went to the office to let Kira know we wouldn't need a shuttle to the trail after all and to see if she had any ideas for getting to Portland to the airport. There were no buses and it was about 2.5 hrs by car. It looked to be a long day of hitch hiking if she didn't have any ideas. But it turned out she did. She was actually on her way to Portland to pick up a friend. She called it serendipity and offered us a ride.One small bright spot in an otherwise abysmal day. We made it into Portland and to the Days Inn near the airport where we had booked a room. We have an early flight out tomorrow.   A huge thank you again to Kira for helping us when we were down and out, we gave her some gas money but that doesn't begin to cover how much she helped us out.And so, to quote part of a Doors song 'This is the End my Friend '. It's funny, even though it's our hike and we are the ones that expended all the energy, time and money to do it, I still feel like I have let the readers of our journal down. I could feel you pulling for us to finish this trail at Mt. Katahdin but I just couldn't do it right now. Even though by all accounts we were ready to begin the easier section.   Ah well, I guess I'll just have to settle for the 2,000 miles that we did hike and be grateful for that, eh?Thanks for reading our journal and to those of you who did, for signing our guest book with such encouraging words.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542502,"""It ain't over till it's over"".                                Yogi BerraI lost count of how many times we fell on this trail. But I would be safe in saying that we have fallen more times on this trail than all of our previous hikes combined. Most of the falls are minor. You trip or slip and before you know it, you are down on the ground. You pick yourself up, dust yourself off, laugh it off and continue on your way.But every once in awhile you don't bounce up and laugh it off. I was reading about Moonbeam in Two Peas journal. She sustained a hike ending fractured femur in a fall. And quite honestly I thought 'that could have been us'. You're hiking to Katahdin and in a flash your thruhike is over.RR smashed her face on a rock in a full on face plant early on in our hike. That was by far the worst and scariest of the falls. After that it was a plethora of garden variety falls that got our attention. We got a lot of practice learning to fall. In that millisecond when you realize that you have reached the point of no return and you are going down, it is best if you can do a midair pirouette and land on your backpack or side. Of course this isn't always possible especially on downhills when you stumble forward and your pack and gravity smash you to the ground. It was a relatively 'benign' fall on June 2nd that put an end to our hike.RR fell with her full force on her knee. She tried to hike on it for two weeks. However the pain intensified in spite of Ibuprofen, strong analgesics and some rest when I was sick. Our hike ended in Stratton Maine about 190 miles from Katahdin.We were disappointed. We headed back home to Arizona. Believe me, the desert is the last place you want to be in the summer. It is an inferno. Temps have peaked at 118 degrees and for the most part our daily highs are 110-115. So we sat in our air conditioned home kind of moping around the first two weeks with a major case of thruhike trail withdrawal.Eventually RR went back to work. She got her knee checked out; xrays were negative for a fracture. Good news. She was still hobbling around but suddenly the knee got better. We talked it over and decided right from the start that we would like to finish the trail, the sooner the better. Maine is a long way from our home. If we let those last 190 miles dangle for a few hiking seasons, it would be less likely for us to head back to the AT.So with that in mind we took Yogi Berra's quip to heart and decided 'it ain't over'.We are heading back to the AT. We have our plane tickets. We fly into Portland on 8/9. We will rent a car and drive to Pinkham Notch. We will hike the 21 miles from Pinkham Notch to US2/Gorham. This will allow RR to pick up the miles that she missed when I fastpacked. From there we will drive to Farmington Maine and drop off our rental car. Then we will hitch the 40 miles back to the AT and head north to Monson.Neither of us has done any hiking since getting off trail, so we are planning a leisurely pace. If all goes well we'll see you back on trail in August. On to Katahdin!Will","Arizona Desert

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545480,"When you have an injury that sidelines you from reaching the finish line, or the finish mountain as it were, you don't really know what the future will bring. Will it end your hiking career permanently, or will you live to hike another day.   I sat around the house for almost three weeks, leg propped up, ice pack draped over my knee.   I hardly stuck my nose out the door. And still my knee hurt. We went to an Urgent Care and had it x-rayed. Not broken. And still it hurt. Until it didn't.   I picked up some shifts at work where I walked around all day pushing ER patients to Ultra Sound and back so I could scan them.   And my knee didn't really yell at all. So here we are, back in New Hampshire   We arrived via airplane in Portland, Maine on Tuesday. Picked up a rental car and went to our room. Wednesday we got our resupply boxes organized and then drove to Gorham, NH. I don't know if you remember, but the first time we came through here Will hiked the 21 miles from Pinkham Notch and I stayed at the Hostel and rested my knee. But since we are coming back to finish our thruhike, Will kindly made plans for us to hike the bit I missed. That way I can have a thruhike too. We went to the post office and then grabbed a quick meal. Then we headed out to Pinkham Notch. By the time we did all that and organized at the trailhead it was 12:15pm. Oh well we know we are way out of shape and plan to take it slow. Breaking what Will did in one day into two.   Of course it was tons of climbing up rocky and steep uphill. I should make a little disclaimer here and say that pretty much ALL my friends and family said ""please try not to fall and hurt yourself this time when you're out there hiking"". To which I replied, I'll do my very best, believe me I don't want to fall! Well, Day 1 and under two hours into our hike Will, not me, steps up a slanted rock face, his foot slips off it and he does   a face plant right before my very eyes. I can hear his head go KATHUNK as it strikes the rock. This all looks and sounds very serious. He hits the ground as I am rushing to him. He didn't pass out or break his skull open thankfully. But he has a couple of generous scrapes and a huge headache.   One of those things that could have been way worse. About 15 minutes later he starts laughing. I know immediately what he is doing since he has done it before. He has a mental picture of what that fall must have looked like and he thinks it is funny. Well, I didn't think it was funny but I can appreciate that he kept his sense of humor through it all.By the time we made it up to the gondola drop off point our legs were quivering from the strain. I think perhaps 'out of shape "" is way too mild a descriptor for us. In our defense, my knee had to heal and it is anywhere from 110 to 115 degrees in Arizona. A bit tough to train. We took a break at a picnic table there and then hiked to a spot near the Carter Notch Hut. We set up our tent and then hiked in to the Hut. We hit it just at dinner time but only picked up some tap water and returned to camp. We ate dinner and turned in. Which brings us to today, Thursday the 11th of August. Sore wouldn't even begin to cover it if you're asking how we feel. I told Will that the only thing that didn't hurt on my body was my hair! And he said 'me too' which is sort of an inside joke because he has a shaved head.   We left our campsite and headed up the Carter Dome trail. Of course it was super rocky and steep. Today would end up being one of those days when it felt you were always climbing steeply uphill but never reaching the top. Or if you did reach it, you would have a short descent and then you would resume climbing again. We did reach Carter Dome but it was encased in trees and so no view to be had. The same for Carter Peak. Today was super hot and we were feeling it. I was sweating but Will was sweating buckets. We would drink about a gallon of water during our hike today and still feel 'behind ' in our hydration. We hiked 6 miles yesterday with the late start, leaving us about 15 for today to get to US 2 and the hitch into Gorham. Which doesn't sound like much for us, however, between the difficult and slow going uphill and downhill and our out of condition state, I was seriously wondering if we would make it to the road tonight. But the last 4 miles eased up and we were able to make better time.We got to US 2 and stuck out our thumb. Took a little bit but a van pulled over to pick us up. They had hiked 1,000 miles of the AT last year and were out filling in some of the spots they had missed. They dropped us off in Gorham. We sure appreciated it. We then got a second hitch back to Pinkham Notch to pick up the rental car from a super nice guy. He wasn't even planning on going all the way out to the Notch, he just did it out of the goodness of his heart. Pretty cool hey?So we picked up the car and drove back to Gorham and got a room. We're clean, we've eaten and we're ready for bed. It's good to be back my friends.   And on that note, I'll catch you later!Road Runner","Pinkham Notch

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545928,"We left Gorham and drove to Farmington Maine where we dropped off the rental car. From there we had about a 40 mile hitch back to the trail. The forecast called for heavy rains. Just as we were about to leave the Enterprise car rental the deluge began. We had a torrential downpour unlike any since we began this hike. We waited out the first wave and then got a ride about 8 miles up the road.The next wave hit while we were hitching.   We got drenched but after about 45 minutes one of the locals who was familiar with the trail picked us up and gave us a ride to the trailhead. He had hiked the Bigelows and said that it was a beautiful area. Unfortunately with the cloud cover and rain we would not have any views.We allowed 4 full days of hiking to reach Monson. We are terribly out of shape. Our packs are heavy and the water from the rain only added to the weight. With a late start, the continuing rain and the steep climb in addition to sucking wind big time, we stopped at the Little Bigelow shelter and grabbed a tent site, made dinner and settled in for the nightIt rained all night and our little camp site turned into a lake. We broke camp in the rain. The tent and ground sheet were laden with water and we never got a chance to dry out as it rained all day. We struggled with the terrain. The descents were slick and treacherous.   We continued our penchant for slipping and sliding as we each had a couple of falls. No major damage. Our high points were Bigelow west and Mt Avery each at a little over 4000 feet. When we reached the West Carry Pond shelter early afternoon, we both had decided that we had had enough. We ducked into the shelter but it was full. So we set up our tent on a platform and changed in to some relatively dry clothes, had dinner and got warmed up. Today was one our most miserable days on the trail. Sometimes it feels like the trail is testing one's resolve. Today was one of those days where we had to pay our dues.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545913,"All the literature and guide books, as well as our fellow thruhikers, have been talking about how much easier the terrain will become on this section of the trail. I have been cautiously optimistic about these declarations. After all, in my book it's all relative. To one hiker certain terrain may be easy, while to another that same terrain may be very hard.Case in point. We were sitting at break a couple days ago and bumped into a hiker named Grandma. He is in his twenties and got busted knitting a hat for himself early on in his hike. We started chit chatting and he said 'it's supposed to get easier soon. The trail should level out. Let's see what mile are we at? Yeah, we have one mile left of the hard stuff and then it will all be easier. ' To which I replied what I have already told you. Easy is relative and he might not want to bank on that because it could mess with his head if it proved to be untrue. Bingo! You already know from Wills journal entry that between the combination of terrain and torrential downpour, it was anything BUT easy. I chose the title 'What a difference a Day Makes' for today because that about sums it up. When we left the shelter and started our hike we felt like we had been transported to another Trail via an alien space ship during the night or something.   Gone was the steep, boulder filled trail with nowhere to safely step. And in its place was a much smoother, leveler trail that was a relative pleasure to hike. Oh, don't get me wrong, there were still some smaller rocks and plenty roots of evil, but comparatively speaking, a veritable race track of trail lay before us.Not only that, but the woods had thinned out and we passed several large, very beautiful lakes along the way.   We met some hikers both at our rest stop at a shelter and on the trail. They seemed like very nice people all. We had been thinking about whether we would camp or get a cabin at the Harrison Lodge. Our gear is pretty wet still and it would be nice to get it dried out.   So we decided to check out the lodge. We had heard it was pretty rustic and it was. But, it had hot water for showers, a cabin on a beautiful river and a 12 pancake breakfast with eggs and sausage thrown in. Take a wild guess which we chose to go for. The lodge you say? Winner winner chicken dinner! Yep, we are staying at the lodge. And we feel like we made the right choice.So, we're clean, we've cooked our dinner and eaten, and we're in our cabin listening to the melodic sound of the river as it passes by our front porch.

Very important. It really helped that the terrain was again relatively flattened. Oh, it was undulating, but the key word is relatively. We had a bunch more for rested walking but had some lakes thrown in to sort of spice things up. We hit the road to Monson at about 3:30pm. We know we are still out of condition, but when there is food and the prospect of a shower and clean clothes involved, apparently we still have what it takes.

It may hurt our egos a bit but we know that we just don't have the conditioning we need right now to be in the state of zippy. It seems that they ran out of interesting names for mountains in this neck of the woods because they resorted to calling them Third Mountain and Fourth Mountain and stuff like that. It was while hiking the Fourth Mountain that Will came up with a trail name for himself.   We were in what is called the Fourth Mountain Bog, walking along the wooden planks provided for us by the AT trail crew. One moment we were walking down the planks, the next Will was flying through the air. He looked like an elite gymnast. He did a half pike rotation and landed on his back in the Bog.While he was soaking wet he was not hurt. So that was very good. He had actually rotated his body to land on his back so it would be a softer landing.   We didn't really talk about it right then he just picked himself up and we continued to hike.

The climbing was one big grunt. Annie could have easily tacked on another 5 miles but I was a big ball and chain slowing us down.We started out from our pretty site on the river with a gradual climb. We were going from 600 feet to 3600 feet at White Cap Mt. But in between there were 3 little ups and downs that added another 1000 feet of climbing. RR would get way ahead and then have to wait for me as I laboriously ascended, sucking wind all the way, my legs shot. BummerWe had exquisite views from the peak of White Cap. It was a popular rest area. From there we descended to 1200 feet at the east branch of the Pleasant River. Then we had one final climb up to Little Boardman Mt where we rolled out the ground sheet and set up our cowboy camp. Today was another sunny day. This is our 3rd night in a row that we have been able to cowboy camp. It is near full moon. It gets really bright after midnight. We could get rain tomorrow. We are thankful for the recent run of great hiking weather. Nice cooling breeze up high and the shade of the forest is most welcome, especially on a day where we climbed 5000 feet. We are already starting to see the leaves falling from the trees, so fall can't be too far off. We got some great views of Katahdin today. It dominates the landscape.

But the campsite we hoped for after the dinner lake we stopped at never materialized and so we did indeed make the unwanted climb.Fortunately, there was a small slanted spot at the top to cowboy camp or we would have had to keep walking. However, in the morning things looked brighter because we had already done the climb and our happy feet could scamper down hill to start the day.This would turn out to be one of our easier hiking days, relatively speaking. We hiked steadily until we reached the Nahmakanta Lake. It was a bit early for dinner but I spied an empty picnic table near the lake. What a luxury! Somewhere to actually sit down on to eat at. And you can spread out your food without putting it on dirt too! So we stopped and ate our dinner there. Very nice. We moved on, hiking just off the Lakeshore or sometimes the trail wound along the beach itself. Multiple brightly colored canoes were bobbing about the lake giving it a sort of festive feel. A lot of hikers told us that they were headed for the Wadleigh shelter tonight so we figured it would be fairly crowded in and around that area. So when we saw a very cool single campsite just off the lake we snapped it up. We can hear the waves gently lapping at the shore. We have set up our tent since the forecast is rain. As darkness covers the lake, the Loons begin their haunting calls. They have such a mournful cry and there is no mistaking who is making it. It echos across the water bidding us good night.

Fortunately it was warm so that the rain didn't present a huge problem.
We had another relatively easy day with  some undulating terrain but for the most part the trail was flat. Not as easy as yesterday due to the wet roots and rocks. The rain stopped around noon but it remained overcast most of the day so we never were able to dry out the tent.
As we hiked along the shore of Rainbow lake, RR must have stirred up a hornets nest with her trekking pole. One minute she was hiking peaceably down the trail, the next she was in a full blown retreat screaming and shrieking. She got about 10-12 hornet stings about her face and arms. She had dropped her poles and when I went to retrieve them, I got my share of stings. I retrieved my poles and one of RR'so but we had to leave one. The hornets won that round.
We cruised in to Abol bridge. We picked up some food at the CG store and then went over to the restaurant for dinner. The food was pricey but the quality was good. We each had a bowl of New England Clam Chowder and a Chicken Breast sandwich. We bumped into several thruhikers who had also sustained multiple hornet stings in the same area at Rainbow lake.

After dinner we moved across the road to Abol Pines CG. It was vacant. We found a nice shelter along the river. We strung up the tent to dry, hung up our wet clothes and hunkered down for the night.

We are set up perfectly for our summit attempt on Katahdin.   We fly back home to Arizona on the 25th, so we have two days to complete our hike. We are 10 miles from Katahdin Stream CG where one checks in with the rangers and begins the ascent of Katahdin.   If we get an early start tomorrow and make those 10 miles, get our permit and the weather looks favorable, then we will attempt to summit.   If the weather isn't all that great, then we will grab a campsite at the Birches Lean To Shelter, hang out and get some rest and then head up to Katahdin on Wednesday the 24th. It is nice to have multiple options and an extra day to sort things out.

Road Runner and Will,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546836,"We ended up getting an early start. We were on trail by 5:30. It wasn't raining and we looked at each other and said 'let's finish this thing' . So we headed out and hit the trail.








I would say that the tread would finally qualify as easy as we pushed toward the base of Katahdin. It was lovely too, with soft pines, river walking and beautiful lakes.
We did a true river ford also; I believe it was the first of this entire trip as we have been able to rock hop the other waterways that were bridgeless. This time we just stepped in; the water rising to a little over mid thigh on me.
We made it to the rangers station by 10am. The office was closed but we signed the register, looked for hikers we knew that had finished and transferred some essential items into day packs that the park provided.
About the time we were ready to leave the rangers showed up, so we had to fill out some forms and get our passes to climb Katahdin. The cut off time for starting your hike up the mountain is 11 AM. So we were anxious to get going. We headed over to the trail head. We signed the register there at 11am. We had 5.2 miles and 4100 feet of elevation gain to the summit.
The trail started out very smoothly and sweetly but picked up rocks and roots of evil as it went along. Then it was back to boulders that were increasingly difficult to get up. All the while we were still in the forest. 
About halfway up we broke out into the open. You could see tiers of huge boulders like the spines on the back of a dinosaur rising ever upward to what looked like the summit. This would turn out to be a false summit however.   And before us going forward and surging back towards us were lines of people. The early starting hikers were on the return trip. Many of which were fellow thruhikers. 
The white blazes on the boulders took creative turns. We reached a point where there were single (rebar) metal rungs anchored into the boulders. It was at this point that quite a few, usually older day hikers were wisely turning back. You would have to pull yourself up and through several tight spaces from here on up. 

We at last reached the 'false summit ' I mentioned.   From there it was along a fairly flat but rock strewn stretch for a bit. Then another climb and we were there! It was getting late and I was a bit worried that everyone would have left the summit and we would have no one I could ask to take our picture. But thankfully there were still a few left. When I told them we had started our hike in Georgia and we're ending it here today on Katahdin they were more than happy to assist us.
We sat and relaxed for a while, shared a Team Tyler victory hug and then started back down the mountain. 
Will quoted Yogi Berra back when we were home in July,saying it ain't over til it's over. Well, for the last 400 miles we kept hearing 'you're almost there'. Today we ARE there. We are done! And it feels wonderful. After experiencing today's hike, and thinking about it I feel strongly that climbing Katahdin is the perfect ending for this journey. It was both difficult and beautiful.
Thanks for following along on the roller coaster ride that has been Will and Road Runner hiking the AT. .Road Runner 
P.S. we decided that both of us should write about our final day so keep reading to see what Will has to say.
The sky was dark blue. It was a perfect day to summit Katahdin. We put the 10 miles from Abol bridge to Katahdin Stream CG behind us and started climbing through the woods. My legs were heavy and I was dragging as the trail got steeper. We climbed over and around big boulders. After about 2 1/2 miles and 2000 feet of elevation gain, we stopped for a short break. The tedium of the climb was getting to me and I was ready to be done. Hiking 2188 miles had taken their toll. 
Our rest over, we broke above tree line and then just like that BAM!!! everything changed. We climbed and scrambled over huge boulders using all 4 of our limbs. My heart was pounding as the intensity of the climb shifted dramatically shaking me from my doldrums and fatigue. What magnificent views. Blue skies and deep blue lakes for miles and miles; untrammeled forest for as far as the eye could see.
I had to stop and take it all in. I wasn't expecting this. It was a masterpiece. A grand finale. What a way to end a grueling hike. I was totally blown away. As the terrain steepened and we climbed up to the false summit. I kept thinking to myself. 'This is PERFECT'. A perfect ending. Out of all of our hikes, this had to be the most compelling end to a journey. This was the ultimate finish. A perfect 10.
We climbed up the false summit. From there I could see the hikers in a long line on the plateau that lead to the summit. We were the latest in a long list, including Thoreau, making a pilgrimage to the summit. It was here at 'Ktaadn' that Thoreau had an experience of the wild and sublime that would forever change the way he saw the world. 
As I hiked over the plateau, the wind picked up but I was comfortable in a short sleeve shirt. I had time to reflect. What was it about these mountains: Denali, Rainier, Whitney, Katahdin that they elicit such depth of feeling? That they could transport me into magical, enchanting, mythological realms of consciousness. 
We eventually reached the summit. We stood on sacred ground. We were enshrouded in the mysterious presence of the sacred. We had hiked 2190 miles. In the end, it was perfect.
