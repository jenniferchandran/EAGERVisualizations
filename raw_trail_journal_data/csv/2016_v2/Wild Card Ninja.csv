Wild Card Ninja,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521286,"So here I am four hundred and three miles from what I once called home. Hiking hundreds of miles does something to you that only those who have walked this journey understand. It forever alters your mind and heart. Being so close to so many wondrous things and meeting kind strangers who want nothing from you but to help aide you on your quest for peace restores your faith in humanity. We walk everyday with aching feet and knees to question all we believe. We wake every morning to see the sunrise and sit in silence as it sets. Relying on only our limited gear and strength of our will and bodies to get us to the next shelter. We are among the ten percent to finish. We are strong, resilient, and persistent. No one will ever be able to take this from us, and as we walk fear falls away again and knowing that we can create anything stands out amongst any other thought that might try and poison our existence. We are strength undefeatable. We are beautiful messes of human beings who know excuses live only in fear and insecurities of minds and hearts untested. We have tested our limits and found that there truly are no limits to what we are capable of. Only the false ones we create in our own minds and thoughts, that no longer exist in us.","

Wild Card Ninja,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521287,"The strong beat of a mad woman's heart""I have a weariness in my bones I've never known before and an ache in my brainI wake I walkAnd wake and walk againBut my thoughts of you late at night still keep me awakeAnd I don't know what I am doingBut I am happy and I am freeWhen I get back- but back to what? Is the question I keep askingI have no homeNo job, no truckAnd I'm down to just one pupMaybe I'll save upBuy a camper or RVMaybe I'll just drive around the US and write and drink until I'm used up. That would be just fine with meI'm living life and it's never easy being bold200 miles in and I still don't give two shits about what I'm toldI'm a mad woman with a heart as pure as gold and I'm walking 2000 miles just to test the strength of my mind and rebuild the beats in my heartMaybe that's where I'll finally startIn the strong beats of my mad woman's heartYeah, maybe that's where I'll start in the strong beats of my mad woman's heartAnd every story on this trail is the sameWe are all looking for something, life's filled us up with disdain And as we walk in winters snow Onlookers point assuming we're insane But I've never felt more saneI've never felt so sane So maybe that's where I'll startWith every step and every beat in my strong mad woman's heartYeah, that's where I'll start in the strong beat of my mad woman's heart","

Wild Card Ninja,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521288,"I would keep walking with your memory weighing down on my back, but you’ve grown too dense for my taste. Besides, I’m not going that way, no- I’m not walking back your way. No, I won’t stay.So I climbed to the top of Snow Bird to sit and watch as the last sliver of sun slipped out of view behind the ridge to bed.I unpacked our moments right there on that mountain top. I dumped them in a pile. I left you there, you always did like it at the top. And my face never could shine as bright as you would have liked. Then I packed up what was left of mine. Yeah, then I walked away. Walked away, leaving you behind. I walked away, without saying goodbye.And I can’t remember the last time my minds felt so lightAnd I can’t remember a time I’ve been this highAnd I haven’t held a stranger through the night in a long long timeBut I just might, yeah, I think I mightAnd with every step I take This heart of stone keeps melting with the snowNow that I’ve found my sense and lightened my loadAnd I know it’s hard for you to see but walking on my own has been good for meThis trails been good for meI have been good to me","
