Patcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524624,"Three days from starting my hike. I start on Sunday morning, May 27 at the Springer Mountain approach trail. My friends Mike/Clinita and family dropped off a mini Easter basket: some Peeps and Jelly Beans for me to eat on Easter. My backpack is ready. The pack base weight is 22.6 lb (everything except food and water). I will have 4 days of food and 2 lbs of water, so my total pack weight will be around 33 lbs. I have set up camp several times over the past few days (here at home) to make sure I have everything that everything works and I am proficient at setting up and taking things down, since some times i will need to setup/take down camp in the rain. Speaking of rain, weather forecast for Sunday and Monday (my first 2 days on the trail) is rain and thunderstorms (but not too cold.) On previous backpacks I have enjoyed hiking thru the rain. hard-driving rains are tough.","Still home

Patcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524783,"My flight to Atlanta is tomorrow morning. Dropped my cat ""Flash"" off at a friends yesterday. Flash as been hiding in their house all day, they are not even sure where he is hiding. He has not eaten since i dropped him off. He will be fine, just a new place for him. I will stop by and visit him today, just before I leave.I have every thing completed a day early: Home is all prepared, I have all I need for backpacking, so today will be a relaxing day, if nothing unexpected comes up. It takes 3 entries prior to the journal being posted on line, so these first 3 entries were just practice and preparation for using the journal during the hike.","stationary

Patcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524945,"Flew from Orlando, Fl. to Atlanta, Ga. The Hiker Hostle shuttled me and several others from the Atlanta airport to their Hostle in Dalogana. 
Weather report for tomorrow has improved some, although there is good chance of rain and thunder storms, it is not a strong front. Will likely hit the trail tomorrow morning 
The Hostle holds 27 folks, and it is full tonight. Most are started by their Appalachian Trail (AT) thru hike: 2175 miles. 
My shuttle also picked up Bryer, from Main and Evan from Florida. Both in their early 20s, full beards, burly and 6' tall. 
Hostle is nice. For sleeping areas, the Hostle has about 6 small rooms. Each room as 2 bunk beds: sleeps 4, a separate bath for each room, it also has a common-area kitchen and common-area lounge with TV and such. It's about $20 per night. My cost is $85 because it including the 2 hour shuttle from the airport. 
The hikers I have talked to appear new to backpacking. But I only talked to a few.",,"Hiker Hostle, Dalagonia,Ga.","Mar 26, Sat",0
