Marge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518451,"My name is Glenn Parker and I am 53 years old. I live in Pensacola, Florida with my wife Marlene, two dogs (Nola and Rosie), and one cat (Bella). We have a son (Joel) and daughter (Brittany) who both reside in Decatur, Georgia. I am retired from the Air Force after 24 years and another seven years as a contractor. Not only am I retired from the military, but I am retired period. After a few years of thinking about hiking on the AT, I've decided that 2016 is the year and I will be hiking solo starting at Amicalola Falls. At this point I have not decided to do a thru hike instead giving myself a week on the trail. After that time, I will then decide to move on or head home. After a very short time of consideration for a trail name, mostly trying to think of something that fits me, I've settled on Marge. Marge doesn't really fit me, but instead it's dedicated to my mom who passed away around 18 years ago. Her name is Margie.",,Introduction,"Dec 17, Thu",0
Marge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518504,"Living in Pensacola provides a great opportunity to HIT THE BEACH! If you've never been to Pensacola Beach, you're missing out. The beach here is so beautiful and blue. But, this journal is not about the beach, it's about my hike on the AT. There's not any mountains in Pensacola. Really, there's not. But, there is some trails located at the University of West Florida, and total about 25 miles.. These trails are used for mountain biking, hiking, and even horse back riding. So, that's where I will be doing all my prep hikes. My plan is to do a long hike every week. So far, this is what I've done:December 5, 2015 - 10.27 miles, 3 hours and 34 minutesDecember 10, 2015 - 12.72 miles, 4 hoursDecember 18, 2015 - 15.74 miles, 4 hours and 56 minutesOk, that's all for now, time to get back to my coffee.",,Prep Hikes So Far,"Dec 19, Sat",0
