Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512204,"I made a decision that I wanted to hike the AT about 30 years ago. It is a dream that I have never let go of. Lots of other dreams have come and gone. Some have been realized. Some were failures. Most just drifted away. The dream to hike the AT has never left me. I’ve backpacked sections of the AT. Mostly this has been in Virginia – Shenandoah National Park and portion close to the Blue Ridge Parkway, Mt. Rogers, as well as doing the entire Presidentials. I’ve done some monumental backpacking trips including Denali National Park, the Canadian Rockies, and Buckskin Gulch + the Paria River Canyon.    Backpacker names Buckskin Gulch as one of the top ten most dangerous backpacking trips. I think it is one of the most beautiful although I was glad to get out of the slot canyon without any rain falling. Besides those trips, I’ve done a lot of additional backpacking in West Virginia, Dolly Sods for example, as well as in Virginia and Pennsylvania.    All these trips have not lowered my desire to hike the AT, they have intensified it.I made a decision, with full spousal approval (thank you, Eric) on a flight home from my niece’s wedding about a month ago. It still hardly seems real.   In the mean time, I have taken a deep dive into all things AT including reading several books (favorite so far is AWOL on the Appalachian Trail), looked at the ATC website, read journals and packing lists here on Trails Journals, and corresponded with a 2014 thru hiker, Nubbins, who provided me with a lot of good information. Thanks to Nubbins for being my first virtual trail angel. My plan is to try a flip-flop starting in Pearisburg, VA starting on St. Patrick’s Day, March 17th. I am hoping that will give me time to head north, make a quick diversion to DC, be in Harpers Ferry for the ATC's Second Annual Flip Flop Kick Off and continue towards Maine. There are a lot of ifs in that plan with heading north as the only part of the plan.Well, here I am 30 years later, getting ready to live the dream.",,Getting Started ,"Aug 31, Mon",0
Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512274,"My quest for lightweight, but affordable, gear continues. For some reason, selecting a tent has been especially difficult. This is coming from someone who already ownes 5 tents! I quickly dismissed the idea of a tarp. Bugs love me, and I believe I have already donated my quota in blood. Hanging in trees in a hammock looked interesting until I started thinking about being stuck in one in the middle of a strong and prolonged storm - way too enclosed. So I decided on an ultralight tent and eventually narrowed down to a Mountain Hardware SuperMega UL1. I can actually sit up in it. Plus it was $100 off at REI. It is samll and weights in at 2 pounds 2 oz on my kitchen scale, a few ounces over the advertised ""trail weight"" which is expected.Shoes and socks are next on the list.

Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512276,"The reactions to my planned AT trip have been very mixed. The vast majority of people are excited for me even if coming from friends who consider getting into a pool as a nature adventure. There have been a few ""are you crazy"" reactions.   And, of course, there are the fears about bears and rattlesnakes. I guess people don't consider that I hike here in Arizona all the time and the Sornoran Desert is crawling with western diamonbacks. I see them on the trail. I've seen them on our driveway. We've had them visiting on our patio. Overall, the feedback has been great. I am so glad to have the support of my friends and family. It means so much.",,Reactions,"Sep 01, Tue",0
Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512432,"After dreaming of an AT thru hike for over 30 years, I made a decision to try a thru hike in 2016. My plans started before I knew about the upcoming, now released, A Walk in the Woods movie. And, I am guessing that most of you, like me, have some concern about how this movie will impact the AT going forward. Will the 2000+ starting thru hikers swell to 3000 or 4000? Will the all dire predictions of more overcrowding come true? Only time will tell. However, here is my take. I went to see the movie last night. First, there were only about 15 of us in the theater, the largest theater in a mega suburban multiplex movie house that often has waiting lines for opening night of smash movies. Again, a total of about 15 of us were there. The short version of my review is that the movie is just dull. It isn't funny. It isn't heartwarming. There really is very little to like or to dislike other than a handful of beatuiful shots of the AT and the Appalachian Mountains. Nick Notle was very good, excellent. Robert Redford was, well, perhaps a whole lot less than very good. I don't see this movie as lasting long in the theaters or bringing out big crowds to see it or bringing out hords of new hikers to the AT. I wanted to like this movie. I've loved the AT most of my life. I think Robert Redford has done a lot to increase environmental awareness. However, the movie was just boring and not engaging at all.
A pretty balanced review from the New York Times:

Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513378,"I've backpacked for over 30 years. During that time, I've seen ""the latest thing"" come and go so many times that I can't even remember all the things I could not possibly live without. Backpackers fall victim to advertising and self-appointed experts as much as any group of people. Magazine and websites that depend on manufacturing advertising dollars actually drive the consumerism. Most experts are sponsored, and many opinions expressed on website discussion boards are those of people who have limited experience beyond what they currently use or, in many cases, what they plan to use. Boots are a great example. They went from giant leather clodhoppers in the 1970s to synthetics with almost mandatory GTX and big clunky Vibram soles in the 80's back to ""light weight"" leather (which were actually heavier than the prior must haves - think Vasque Sundowner GTX at 3.3+ lbs) and now to trail runners. First strong ankle support was a must evolving to today's no ankle support. Loaded packs have gone from around 40+ lbs to well below 20 or even 15 pounds for the most Spartan ultra light backpacker. Light weight is great but often leaves no margin for error nor does it leave much room for comfort in many cases. Through all of this, I am attempting to find a balance between weight, comfort, and safety. An early March start date, even when starting in Virginia after Mt. Rogers, can involve straight up winter and snowy conditions. Perhaps worse is 35 degrees and rain. Staying warm is important. Avoid hypothermal is vital. I am also trying to avoid getting sucked up into opinions about “must haves” that did not exist a decade ago when people were successfully thru hiking the AT and the PCT. Some of today's must haves are great. Many will not last until the end of the decade. Sure, I can sleep under a tarp and have wind, rain, and bugs plague me all night, but do I want to? I think some type of real tent - dry and free from blood sucking bugs - would serve me better. A bivy is just too small, but I think I can live with a very small one person tent that I can actually sit up in. Having a decent stove (Jetboil Flash, for example) might be better than a super cat alcohol stove? I happen to have saved a good supply of Fancy Feast cans, so I am still pondering that question. Again, the quality of the experience is a balance among weight, comfort, safety, and convenience. I am working through my list as carefully as I can. Using lighterpack.com has been very helpful in getting my pack weight down. It is a great tool that is free. My current pack weight is 16.2 pounds with winter gear but without food or water. It includes what many consider a luxury item - my kindle. I think I would go crazy without it, so it seems more required than optional for me. All this obsessing over weight and comfort, safety, and convenience is a lot more fun than I would have ever expected. One person I've emailed with told me it was the second best part of her thru hike after the hike itself. I guess that makes me feel pretty good about the actual hike. I'm having a blast!",,"Ounces vs. comfort, safety, and convenience","Sep 14, Mon",0

On Friday and Saturday, we did some hiking. The first hike was Bright Angel Trail, 5 miles down to Indian Garden and 5 miles back up. The trail is switchbacks, but it is entirely down and then entirely up. There never is a break. On Saturday, we did about 8 miles on the Rim Trail which is essentially flat. The weather was perfect.

Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514003,"Since this is a 30+ year dream, I have to say that the idea of doing a flip-flop has not entirely settled well with me. My dream has never been to start in Harpers Ferry or in Marion. My dream has always been to have the full AT experience including the kind of crazy conditions at Springer. It is the AT thru hiker experience for the vast majority of people. With that said, I can see why the ATC is asking people to consider alternative starts. After over a month of flip-flopping on the question of to flip-flop or not to flip-flop, I finally resorted to the Magic 8 Ball. Although I have absolutely no belief in the Magic 8 Ball beyond it being a fun toy, it seems the ultimate way to make a decision when both options are about equally attractive with no especially strong downsides to either. I also know that the Magic 8 Ball is heavily weighted to answering Yes or Signs Point to Yes over No. So, I asked Eric to tell me what to ask the 8 Ball. He asked, ""Should he start in Georgia?"" The answer was YES, not even Signs Point To Yes. He could have just as easily asked if I should do a flip-flop or start in Virginia since I think outloud about this far too much. He is kind to listen.So I will having an early start in Georgia, February 23rd. I've already booked my shuttle and hostel for the 22nd at Hiker Hostel (hikerhostel.com).

Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514510,"Reading about and picking new equipment is so much fun. A lot of my backpacking gear is old and heavy. it is fine for a weekend or a week, but not for a thru hike. So, I've spent the past several weeks reading equipment reviews and journals to try to find the right equipment. I'm wearing out our kitchen scale! One of the things that has become very obvious to me is that I lack the opportunity to test this new gear out as much as most people do. Here in the Sonoran Desert, it is still pretty much full on Summer. The reality is that I really will have no local opportunity to test winter gear unless I go up to Flagstaff or some other area at a much higher elevation. We don't even get a frost every year here. The same lack of testing opportunity is true for my new rain gear - Outdoor Research Helium II rain jacket and Helim rain pants. Maybe I will get in the shower with it or put it on and run out into the next rain we get. That could be a month or more away; we only get 10"" a year.The one good thing about doing a lot of desert hiking is the idea of rattlesnakes really does not bother me at all. We have a lot here, and I see them while hiking enough that I am respectful but not freaked out by them. In reality, we get them on our patio, on the driveway, and I'm sure that there are always one or two some place in the yard. Bears and moose are another story, however, although I have had some close enounters with bears and bears with cubs while sections hiking the AT in SNP. They seemed to be less bothered by me than I was by them.

Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514521,"If anyone is willing, I would appreciate a review of my current gear list. My current start date is 2/25, so I am a bit heavy on the clothing weight.A few things I am not sure about: 1. Boots vs. trail runners (with or without gaiters?) for the start? Right now I am leaning towards boots with the idea of switching to trail runners after Mt. Rogers.2. For an early winter start, I feel like I need a full set of clothes for day and a dry set for night. That might be reduced when it gets a bit warmer and hypothermia is not as big a risk.3. My sleepipng bag is warm. I have a 4oz silk liner. Not sure if I need it or not in light of my camp/night clothes? Do I need it? On my list, items with a gold star means that I need to still buy them. If you have a better suggestion, let me know. If there is no gold star, it is unlikely that I am going to trade out a big ticket item for a similar big ticket item. For example, I got a smoking deal on a Thermoball jacket by The North Face and would not be inclined to trade it for a Patagonia Nano Puff, which is very simialr and gets similar ratings.

Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515913,"I do a lot of hiking here in Arizona. Although I am not a native, 11 years of living here makes the desert seem normal. Earlier this week, I was out hiking on the trail in the attached picture. It occurred to me that I'd be on the AT in a little over 4 months. Rather than it being dry and dusty, it would icy, snow covered, or wet. None of these options are typical here. Much of my equipment I'll be using for an AT thru hike is new. A lot of my old equipment is old and heavy, which has given me the ""chore"" of buying new equipment. It has been a lot of fun reading posts, watching YouTubes, and neurotically putting every item I plan to use on the kitchen scale and then entering it on my gear list. The downside of living here in Arizona is that testing equipment that I'll need in the late winter in Georgia is hard to test when it the highs here are still in the high 90s and the lows are in the high 60s. Since it almost never rains, I am not sure how I will test my rain gear. Every now and then I think about the possibility of arriving like Cheryl Strayed - gear still with the tags on. I guess I could always stand in the shower or under the garden hose.I have gotten so much good feedback on my gear list both from here and also from whiteblaze.netI am so appreciative of people who clearly took a lot of time and thought to provide detailed advice.

One hundred days – that is where my head is.    Right now, much of day-to-day life just seems like a distraction until I start. Dinner is great, but I'd rather be on the trail. Annalise Keating just got another killer off scott free, but I am too busy reading thru hiker blogs to follow the plot.   After dreaming of this trip for 31 years, my head is in Georgia. My body just needs to catch-up.   Thanksgiving.Christmas.Springer. I tweaked my gear some and, in doing so, was able to cut a few pounds off my base weight and actually get some better equipment. Currently REI has the Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 2 on sale for $259 which is $100 below the normal price. Roomier. Cheaper. Lighter. Not a lot of decision needed for that.After decades of having a house full of cats, it is finally paying off. I am joining the ranks of the Supercat Stove cult. My Jetboil Mini Mo will have to stay home for now. Maybe when I am able to offload some of my winter gear, I will be able to demonstrate some of my superior camp cooking skills. Until then, oatmeal and noodles like everyone else. I also decided to upgrade my backpack to an Osprey Atmos 65 AG from an Exos 58. Despite the increase in weight, I think it is well worth it. I've never had such a comfortable pack before. It fits me perfectly. At times, comfort trumps lighter. I mean, seriously, if all goes well I will be wearing the thing for about 6 months. Comfort cannot be measured on a kitchen scale. I did get a couple of items from ZPacks and have to say that they have outstanding customer service and very high quality items. The one thing I got that I really like is the rain kilt (1.9 oz) and a pair of gaiters (2.2 oz - Waterproof-Breathable Cuben Fiber-eVent). I hate rain pants and how I become a living petri dish after a day or two of high humidity steaming under Goretex (does it actually keep rain out or just keep sweat in?). So the gaiters and the kilt are likely to keep me and those around me a lot happier. Plus, the kilt and gaiters are lighter than the UL rain pants I was going to use. I'm sure I'll never hear the end of this decision from my brothers. I need to do a series of shakedown hikes soon. I am going to do them on the Arizona Trail, which is unfortunately about as opposite of the AT conditions as you can get. No need for rain kilts here. To test out my cold weather gear I am going to go the San Francisco Peaks near Flagstaff or over to the White Mountains. Despite the perception of Arizona being a desert with a giant ditch in the middle, it also has the biggest stand of Ponderosa Pines in North America, snow, skiing, and lots of mountains over 10,000 feet. Finding cold conditions is not difficult. Testing my rain gear is another story.If I cannot get out in the rain, and that is always a trick when living in the Sonoran Desert, I guess I can test my stuff in the shower or under a sprinkler.   A lot of people think this thru hike idea demonstrates poor judgment, at best.

Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518194,"The fear of being cold is much greater for a resident of the Phoenix area than rattlesnakes (we have loads of them) or black bears (I've already had several up close and personals with 'em on the AT in Virginia) or even AT shelters overrun with mice and hikers with highly offensive body odor. So, when there was a recent cold snap here in Phoenix, I headed out to Tonto National Forest to higher elevations to test my new sleeping bag - a Kelty Ignite 20 / EN 16.https://www.kelty.com/product/ignite-20-en-16I selected a site for an overnighter at about 3500' along a ridge line. There was a heavy breeze and, since much of Tonto National Forest has few trees to speak of, I would be well exposed. As I was setting up my tent at close to sunset, the temperatures had already dropped from the high 50s into the low 40s and the breeze would pretty much ensure that my tent was not going to get very warm from my body heat. It was a good site choice to maximize exposure.For the night, I slept in a Icebreaker Everyday Long Sleeve Crewe and Icebreaker Apex Leggings. I used a Therm-A-Rest Z Lite Sol pad (R value 2.6) which has a much lower R value than the Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XTherm pad (R value = 5.7) that Santa will be delivering later this month. The XTherm will go on the trip with me. So, overall, the sleeping system was not totally optimized to match what I would be using on the AT. About the middle of the night, around 2 AM, I woke up. The temperature was in the mid-20s but the wind had pretty much died down.   I was feeling nice and warm in the Ignite 20. It is a down bag, 600 DriDown fill, with a screaming red cover There really were not significant cold spots. My only complaint is with the hood which took a bit of work to get situated correctly. I am hoping that practice makes perfect on that point.Overall, I was very happy with the Ignite. I do realize that, with an early start, the Ignite 20 will likely be pushing the edge of its limits in the GSMNP where the lows could easily be zero.   i think the addition of the upgraded pad, a Sea to Summit Reactor Thermolite Mummy Bag Liner, and some additional clothes will do me good with this sleeping bag.   It did great very close to its temperature rating on a fully exposed ridge line.

I know, it has happened to me when I was a teenager in Pennsylvania. I think my car sustained more damage than the deer which just ran off. Here in Arizona, however, deer sightings are pretty rare. Hikers are much more likely to see bobcats, rattlesnakes, coyotes, or javelinas than to spot a deer.   In 11 years of living here, I think I’ve seen deer about 5 times. So, I was very pleased to see 4 mule deer cross the trail about 50 yards ahead of me while I was out on a training hike today.

Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518372,"Rain is word more often followed by a frowny face than an exclamation mark, or 3, unless you live in the desert. Desert dwellers are fascinated by rain. We sit outside and watch it rain; some people even get up in the middle of the night to watch it. I think that when you live in an area that gets 8"" to 12"" of rain a year, you have a strong sense of the relationship between water and life. When we see rain, we see life. Rain makes the desert smell wonderful. Rain makes the desert turn green and break out in flowers. Toads that spend almost their entire life underground dig their way up to the surface and mate and then dig back to their normal almost lifeless form until another rain. Trees and shrubs that look dead most of the year break out in bright green leaves. Rain awakens the desert in almost a mystical way. It is impossible to not have a very primal sense of the relationship between rain and life. Today, however, I did not see life when I saw rain. Rain was not a mystical experience. What I saw was a rare opportunity to put up my tent and don my rain gear to see if they actually are waterproof. OK, I admit it, setting up your tent in front of a suburban house isn't exactly a shakedown, but it is striking when the iron is hot, or in this case, wet. When the rain started, I ran and got my tent and rain jacket and headed out into the front yard.In the Phoenix area, where we often talk about rainfall in the 1/100th of an inch increments, my OR Helium II rain jacket and my BA Fly Creek 2 are doing their job at the current rainfall total of 0.17"".

I was out in the desert having a great time when, all of a sudden, it felt like a lightening bolt had just passed through my left heel. Crap, I thought, my plantar fasciitis just returned in a very dramatic manner after almost 3 years of it being gone. So there I was, at that time, about 3 months out from my start date with a new case of plantar fasciitis. The ticket to Atlanta is purchased, my gear is tested, the kitchen scale is just about worn out from neurotic weight checking, and the shuttle is booked. I am just counting days and hiking in the desert.""Wait four days to return to hiking"" was my podiatrist's advice after injecting my foot with cortisone. He also suggested that I recover my orthotics with a different material that was less likely to cause blisters. Not only had a gotten the go ahead on a thru hike from my podiatrist, he was maximizing my experience by upgrading my orthotics. After four days, I did start hiking and things seemed great. Then, a few days prior to Christmas, I quickly slipped on a pair of dress shoes without putting in my orthotics. I was in a hurry. We were late for dinner with some friends, and I did not want to be rude. Well, by the end of the evening I was limping. So here I am a bit back at square one. I've pretty much doubled down on all the things I should be doing - calf stretches 3X/day, night splint (7 oz. to add to my base weight, thank you), liberal doses of Vitamin I, no barefoot walking even to the bathroom in the middle of the night, and orthotics at all times. The plantar fasciitis seems to be much better than it was a week ago despite my inability to comply with resting my foot (I did a 6 mile hike yesterday and a 7 mile straight up and back down a nearby mountain the day before yesterday). What I noticed was that the pain was much worse after hiking. Duh. Mind you, I'm a nurse practitioner, and you'd think I would accept this simple fact - rest is necessary to cure plantar fasciitis. I guess living in the land of denial is a nice, but in this case, a self-defeating place to be.So my resolve for 2016 is consult with a physical therapist on Monday. Rest for a few weeks (I will hate it, but rest works) and do all the other things that have always gotten my plantar fasciitis to resolve in about 2 to 4 weeks. I've also come to the realization is that there are many ways to hike the AT. If an early Springer start does not work, I will do a flip-flop from SW Virginia or Harpers Ferry or the Delaware Water Gap depending on when I am better. If I am still not better for any of those plans, there is always the SOBO option. A former thru hiker recently told me that flexibility was the key to success, that the AT, if nothing else, will drive home the point that my best plans often have little or nothing to do with the reality of a thru hike. I guess this is installment #1 of that lesson.P.S. - In my life, when all else fails, there is always the Magic 8 Ball, Obviously, I don't really believe in it, but it is kind of fun. It is a great way to make a complex or overwhelming situation a little less serious. Well, when asked if I would have a 2/25 start at Springer, the Magic 8 Ball says, ""Signs Point to Yes"" which is exactly what my attitude is right now. Springer on February 25th?

Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520588,"Today is Groundhog Day and Punxsutawney Phil predicts an early spring which seems like very good news for all us early starters in the Class of 2016. I know I am getting really excited about my start whenever that happens.I am rapidly on the mend from my plantar fasciitis and am now wondering if my start date can still be on 2/25 or if I will need to push it back 2 or 3 weeks. I am almost without pain for the past couple days and have been rapidly increasing my hiking distance and using trails with a lot more elevation change and challenging surfaces. Like Pennsylvania (appropriate to mention my home state on Groundhog Day!), there is no shortage of rocky trails to hike on in Central Arizona. In either case, my original start date or a mid-March date, I am only a handful of weeks away from heading out. Acclimatizing to the cold is still my biggest fear. Fortunately, we are in the middle of a ""cold"" snap here in Phoenix, so I will be sleeping outside in temps that are at least near freezing. In general, a beautiful winter is not a bad problem to have. However, transporting yourself from days in the 60s and 70s to the reality of winter in the Appalachians does present some adjustment problems. Like most other things in my life, the worrying is likely to be much worse than the reality, but it does help with the proper planning!

Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521289,"Much of my recent posting has been about my foot which, thankfully, is on the mend. It could have been a deal breaker for this trip, but things have worked out well. However, that is not at all the reason why I am an unlikely thru hiker.About 8 years ago, I started to notice a very faint burning in my mid chest during the start of spin class. At first, I was not sure it was there or if I was imaging it. Over a couple of years, this pain increased and was present with less and less exertion. It got to the point where I had chest pain just walking up a flight of stairs. I had the million dollar work up – two cardiac catheterizations, nuclear stress tests, 30-day heart monitors, upper and lower endoscopies with a pH monitor temporarily implanted in my esophagus. Eventually, my first cardiologist started treating me like I was crazy and handed me off to the nurse practitioner despite the fact that I had very significant EKG changes during stress tests (it looked like I was having a heart attack) and no diagnosis, so I changed cardiologists.My new cardiologist treated me very differently. He stated the obvious that, crazy or not, crazy does not cause EKG changes like the one I had during a stress test. He worked with me trying different medicines. Eventually he found the right combination and I have been chest pain free for several years now. I can hike, ride my bike, or do any aerobic exercise that I am able to do without chest pain.So with about a week until Springer, I want to thank my cardiologist, Allan, for sticking with me and fixing me. You are the best! I would never be doing this without your care.To finish the story, I was eventually evaluated at the National Institutes of Health by a physician who specializes in research on unusual chest pain syndromes. I underwent some very expensive testing that is not done in normal clinical practice. What it showed was that I did indeed have ischemia (inadequate oxygenation) in my heart muscle when exercising; it just isn’t caused by a blockage of the major arteries which is what is normal for most people with chest pain.",,An Unlikely Thru Hiker,"Feb 17, Wed",0

Stopped by the Fontana Hilton - a shelter with a shower. I hiked for a while with Large, a man from Princeton, who is hiking with his daughter. Although the day was mostly climbing from Fontana, it was a fairly easy climb. Crossing the dam was spectacular. It is the largest dam in the East. At some point during the day, I run into Handles who had given me some liquid soap at the Fontana Lodge to help avoid the rumored norovirus in the GSMNP. There actually was a kid who had been very sick for a few days at Fontana. At camp that night were the Vagabonds (10 Degrees, Badger, Powder), Casey Jones ( who told me his grandfather had been a Deadhead), Baby Chicken, Optimistic Dreamer, and Nutella, I think. There were also a bunch of Spring Break students. Beautiful day. 
As we entered the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, there was a posted warning at the box where thru hikers drop their shelter permits. The warning was about possible GI/diarrhea illness. It said that water must be chemically treated or boiled. Of course, almost all thru hikers use Sawyer or similar filters. What I saw was most people getting water far from shelters and filtering. Most, not all, are avoiding water sources near shelters. I saw nobody boil water except me and then only if I got water near a shelter. Most hikers seem to have no concept of how dangerous severe diarrhea can be or have considered fully the idea of 3 days of severe diarrhea and vomiting while stuck in a tent in a wilderness area without even a privy. To be honest, the lack of privies at many shelters in GSMNP is likely leading to this problem. Honestly, the sanitation at shelters in the park is a disgrace. The blame is shared by the Park Service for not providing adequate facilities and lazy hikers who do no dig proper cat holes. The designated ""toilet"" areas near shelters is a mine field of poop and used toilet paper. The Park Service seems to just ignore these unsanitary conditions that have been a reality in the GSMNP for decades.","Zero Day at Fontana

The level of commitment needed to complete the AT is not part of my make-up. For me, and this is just for me, I had come to understand that the cost of being away from home and the effort to hike approximately six days a week was not being balanced by any type of equal reward. Again, this is just for me. Some seem to thrive in a life of hiking, eating, and sleeping. For me, it quickly became a monotonous routine. It was clear that I need to end while I still love the AT and backpacking. While I was laid-up in Gatlinburg, I decided that I really wanted to complete the portion of the trail in GSMNP. It was not clear to me if I would continue to Hot Springs or perhaps even beyond. On my first day back on the trail, 3/22, I realized that I just wanted to get through the Smokies and go home.I never mentioned this to anyone, as I really did not want to be a negative influence for those who were happy being thru hikers. It is an incredibly hard job, much more mentally than physically (and I do not want to diminish the reality that the hiking in the Southern Appalachians was HARD for me). On this morning, I did let Journeyman know it would be my last day and texted a few friends who were a day or two ahead of me.The 29 days and 237.9 miles I spent on the AT were a great experience for me. It allowed me to attempt a dream of mine that I've held for over 30 years. I met some fantastic people, some of whom are still on the trail and others who left the trail long before I did. As I said, attempting a thru hike on AT is physically difficult but even more psychologically challenging. At least that is how it was for me.My hope is that I continue from when I ended either later this year or next Spring. I'd hope that perhaps I can be a 2000 miler over a period of years and complete the entire trail. I think that 4 to 6 week blocks will suit me best. When I got home, I was wearing, of course, my day clothes for hiking. I have to admit that I was very sad to take these clothes off, what in reality has become part of my identity.

Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526063,"I got home about a week ago after making a decision to stop my thru hike after finishing up to the northern side of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Now, after some reflection, I've decided to restart in a couple of weeks from Harpers Ferry as a flip flop. This was one option I had considered before I started but opted for the traditional Springer start.Here are a few lessons learned that I might have better considered during my first month:1. If you feel bored or miss your family, address those issues. Have a friend or family member come visit. Use Skype or FaceTime. Take a trip home if necessary.2. Food is very important and most of us eat crap for our thru hikes. When conditions are challenging, poor quality food is not a relief but just another thing that gets under your skin. For me, raisins, dried figs, and prunes were a big relief from eating a protein bar each hour. Despite constant eating, I lost 12 pounds in one month - finding food you enjoy in vital.3. A kindle or a well stocked MP3 player might not be a luxury item but perhaps one of the keys to your success. When life is basically hiking, eating, and sleeping day after day, a bit of pleasant diversion might be what gets you through those 2189.1 miles. Remember that this is likely a once in a lifetime event. Going entirely spartan might be your ticket to an early exit.4. Make decisions when you are well rested, never at the end of the day, or in a hasty manner.5. Take time to enjoy the beauty of the Appalachians. Enjoy the trail towns. If you have time, take time. Day after day of looking down at the trail all day does not make for fun. 6. Leave early in the morning and stop for a half hour lunch and consider a short cat nap at lunch. 7. Take breaks especially when there is a view.8 Use sock liners and properly fitting shoes. I got shoes that were 1 full size too big and used Injinji sock liners. I never even had a hot spot (knock on wood).9. Find thru hikers that you can relate to. Constant discussion of the AT, gear, and what food you really really really miss gets boring very quickly (although the part about missing decent food seems impossible to not discuss).10. Pack light, really light, really really really light. I am doing a very aggressive shake down of my stuff. I have to say that restarting in April is a lot different than a Springer start in Feb.Finally, realize what an impact a thru hike has on you. For the first 5 days that I was at home, every night I would wake up, and, during those first few minutes of being disoriented, I would think I was in a shelter and or wonder how long my hike for the day would be.   Then, I 'd notice a ceiling fan or a lamp and realize I was not on the AT. Despite being happy to be home, I always had a very sad realization that I was not in my tent or in a shelter. I also have not slept nearly as well in my bed as I did in my tent regardless of the conditions - rain, snow, cold and windy, loud owls right over my tent, or hearing several people around me snoring.

Wazo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526656,"Before my return to the AT from Arizona, there were three equipment issues I wanted to have addressed. What I learned is that some outdoor gear manufacturers stand by their products and provide outstanding service; others do not.1. The North Face. I used a Thermoball jacket during my first month on the AT. It was plenty warm and very light. I loved that it was not down and, therefore, keeps some insulating properties when wet. However, a pocket zipper broke the first week on the AT - essentially the first week I used it since I live in Phoenix. I called TNF from the trail. Their only idea of help was for me to mail them the jacket. Obviously, I was not going to head toward the Smokies with no jacket.   When I got home, I hastily sent the jacket to TNF for repair or replacement. My mistake was not reading their entire policy. Their turnaround time is 6 to 8 weeks. When I made a decision to return to the trail I called them and they told me they could not return the coat, as is, until they had it for 2 to 3 weeks because ""it would not be in the system"" until then. When I explained that I was doing a thru hike....crickets. Customer service grade - D (only not getting an F because they do fix their defective equipment). Think about this, you buy a winter jacket, a zipper breaks, you ship it to TNF, and it is returned 8 weeks later when Spring has arrived.2. ZPacks. I had a problem with a pair of Challenger gaiters. First, before I get to my story, I just want to say that these are great gaiters, well designed, and very light (remember the old rule about weight on the feet). Unfortunately, my gaiters ripped during my first month. When I got to Arizona, I emailed them and got a prompt response from Will ""Red Beard"" Wood. He assured me that this was a unique event and that ZPacks would replace or refund, my choice. Then I got a second email from him stating that he verified that this was a unique event. My choice was to replace the gaiters because I really liked them a lot (they got a lot of attention from other hikers - the ZPacks Challenger Gaiters are outstanding looking and also functionally). They also promised to get them to me in time before I go back to the AT. Now that is customer service! Grade - A+. BTW, I have several additional ZPacks products and am extremely pleased with them. Note: I am not sponsored by ZPacks in any manner. I am just passing along my experience.3. REI. Not a manufacturer, obviously. I started with an Osprey Atmos AG pack. I loved the design and the suspension. It really makes a fully loaded 36+ pound pack (hey, I started in February) feel light. It did have a problem in that the velcro adjustments for the belt kept slipping on one side. It was OK early on as I had extra weight on (AKA being a little chunky). As time progressed, however, I needed to make the side that held as short as possible. With the weight loss I was experiencing, 12 pounds in a month, it would have been soon that the belt would have been too big. I took the pack back to REI and exchanged it for a Osprey Exos which, in reality, it more suited for going back on the AT in mid-April. Also, the Exos does not have the velcro waist belt adjustment system. As always, REI has great customer service and a outstanding return policy. A+ NOTE: The guy at REI told me that they get a lot of Atmos packs returned. I found that to be interesting as it is one of the most popular packs with AT thru hikers. Everyone I talked to loved their Osprey Atmos and nobody but me seemed to have the problem with the velcro.Bottomline of this post is that not all customer service is equal. I will avoid TNF products and will stick with manufacturers like ZPacks and stores like REI that provide outstanding service. 11 days until I am back on the trail.","Harpers Ferry on 4/17

At the train station in HF, I met 4 people about to start their hikes - Bill, Steve, Brenda, and Alicea. Together, we climbed up the steps from the station and made our way to our hostels or hotel. On the way, we stopped at the ATC and met some great people including Laurie Potteiger who planned the Festival.The Festival started Saturday with a talk just for flip floppers by the ATC CEO. There was live music all day, workshops, shakedowns, and food trucks. There was also a group of people from the 12 Tribes (of Yellow Deli fame) wandering around outside who gave me not one, but two, tracts. I guess I looked to need spiritual help to them.Saturday night, I went out to dinner again with the same people I'd met at the train station plus Ziptie who is from Vermont but now lives in Nebraska - all very nice people.I got a pair of gaiters from an outfitter for my friend, Fiona, who will be joining me for the first 5 days of this segment of my hike.I got my official AT pic taken and was assigned brown number 10. Brown is NOBO alternative route color. It seems that each color starts at 1, so there have been 9 people who started at Springer this year who have followed some alternative route other than the traditional NOBO path.   Laurie from the ATC told me that I was classified as a NOBO - Leap Frogger - Flip Flopper. So there you have it, my official classification for very much hiking my own hike.One very interesting thing I've noted about Flip Floppers is the difference in demographics than at Springer. The average age is much higher and there are more women. Women are still a minority but the percentage is much higher here.I have to give the entire Flip Flop Festival experience 2 thumbs up. The program was great, and I've met lots of really fun people.Fiona arrives at 730 in the morning and then I'll be back on the AT.","

Crossing the Juniata and Susquehanna Rivers was fun but far from a wilderness. After that, it is a long climb of very gentle switchbacks up the hill. The entire climb was full of traffic sounds from Rt. 322 and also a band playing at some club on the river.
I stopped at a shelter for lunch. There happen to be 20 Amish people there who were out for a day hike. They were pretty interested in the register. THey also asked me about my hike and one asked to see my gear. I was able to yogi (actually, they just gave me) a chicken sandwich which was quite tasty and on homemade bread.

I was hoping to get to the next camp before the rain.After about 6 mikes, my foot really started to bother me. I'd had trouble with plantar fasciitis since last November and typically was limping a bit after hiking more than 12 miles. Interestingly, Lost and Found told me she coukd tolerate about 12 mikes and then hiking got to be a lot more painful due to her plantar fasciitis.   Anyway, I decided to quit for the day and backtrack to the last road. I got a taxi to the Tuxedo Motel in Southfields. I came to the conclusion that this was the end of my AT adventure. For weeks, I realized thathat completing a thru hike was not a goal for me. I think that being a slow paced section hiker is more my style. Since Harpers Ferry, I've met a lot of section hikers. I actually relate to them better. I really believe that the outlook and goals of thru hikers are similar but different in subtle ways well beyond the distance goal. Thru hikers have a goal that is very hard to do and requires focus and discipline.   Section hikers seem more laid back; they don't have to walk 2189.1 miles in 4,6, or even 8 months. They might have a week or month to hike at a pace that fits them. They tend to take more time checking thins out. Thru hiking tasks strong motivation. It took me 3 months to finally be ok with the fact that I lack that motivation to be a thru hiker. In a way, this makes sense to me. I retired at an early age to relax after years of being on the work and school treadmill. I leave the AT feeling very good about my time and 450 miles. It was a great experience. I met some wonderful people and really learned a lot about myself. With that said, I have to say that I am ready to go home via a week at the Beach at Hilton Head.

After 15 years of night splints, orthotics, injections, taping, physical therapy, rolling my feet on orange juice cans, etc. I am hoping this will be the fix. I met a few people on the AT who had very severe plantar fasciitis which was only cured with surgery. I am very hopeful.

Almost none of the people I became friends with went off trail beside me. Their success makes me so happy. Despite having only done about 450 miles on the AT this year, I have to say this is was one of the best things I've done. I met great people, really great people, who really touched my life.",,Postlude - Fixing My Feet,"Aug 17, Wed",0
