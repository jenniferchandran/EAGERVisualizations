No Regret,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523972,"I choose to start in Virginia. There are six reasons for this decision.One, Virginia is my home state, where I grew up, a garden for my ancestral roots, a spiritual home. It will be a homecoming.Two, the AT in Virginia is beautiful as it rides the crests of long ridges rising above a landscape of forests and farmlands and small towns, some with Civil War legacies. When not on the ridges, the trail drops into gaps with easy access to towns for re-supply. In Virginia, the AT loses some of its wilderness character to become America's footpath.Three, a Virginia start means bypassing the big peaks in Carolina and the oppressive crowds and annoying trail rules in the Smokies. Save the Smokies for the end of my hike, if I get that far.Four, Virginia can be easy to reach from Minnesota. Amtrak's Cardinal Line runs out of Chicago every other day and will deliver me to Hinton, West Virginia, which is a short shuttle drive to Pearisburg, a trail town.Five, starting in Virginia the same time that thousands of thru-hikers are pushing off from Springer Mountain 400 miles to the south means my hike will be pleasant from the start, with vacancies in many trailside shelters.And six, if my AT hike is a short one and takes me to no other state beyond Virginia, then, at least, I will seen the best AT has to offer.Virginia it is.","

No Regret,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524309,"The baseball season begins in two weeks. It will be long, 162 games and 6 months, not counting the post-season. It is longer than any other sport and is called a season for good reason. It begins with soft, green hopes in spring and ends with the cold, hard facts of autumn. Fans' spirits are mirrored in this description, as they leave the shelter of their homes in April and rush outside to play in warm sunshine after a winter of hibernation, and then, in October, they say goodbye to the season by putting up storm windows.   Life is a baseball season, or vice versa. Teams play every day with few days off. With so many games each is diminished in individual importance. Whether a team wins or loses matters only in the aggregate. Slumps are unavoidable. Winning streaks don't last. No single game or series assumes the life-or-death imperative of a duel, or a gladiator in the arena, or a prizefighter in the ring. Bad day today? There's another game tomorrow. In the end the team that is crowned champion is the one that wins only 3 of every 5 games by bringing a discipline and attention to fundamentals to every game, day after day, win or lose. Hitting the cutoff man every time is more important than an occasional walk-off homer.Such is life. We go to work every day, and not every day is brain surgery or a rocket launch or Christmas. Seldom does one day rise in high importance over others. We show up and practice good routines, in life and at our jobs, good days and bad, until, in the end, we find that we had a great life and career because of our discipline to bring an equally honest effort to everything we did. Such is the AT. The AT is life, and, thus, a baseball season. It is the long season from April to October. Hiked south to north, it starts with the fresh promise of a budding Southern Spring and ends in glory on the cold, hard granite in Maine. No single day is more important than any other. If its great distance is to be won, fundamentals must be observed. Discipline and endurance and practiced routines, not speed, will be the difference. Not every day will bring sunshine, vistas, and grandeur. Some days will be faced alone. There will be rain and blisters. There are few days off.       ","

No Regret,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524833,"It's called a Pocket Rocket and it's not what you think. It's not a kid's toy. And it's not the nickname some cocksure teenager gave to the lump in his jeans.After hours of careful research I've chosen the Pocket Rocket to be my most vital kitchen appliance, my stove, the critical element that will close the gap every day between hunger and a bowl of cooked rice, or a hot cup of coffee. If it fails, dry instant oatmeal flakes will have to get me to lunch.The Pocket Rocket is a tiny contraption, almost a joke of simplicity. But at 3 ounces it is a backpacker's dream. It will burn that much weight in fuel every other day. Inserted into the nozzle of a fuel canister that acts as its base, the Rocket boils a pot of water twice its size with the BTU's of a blast furnace and then throttles down to a quiet simmer. The best part: when not in use, it folds like a praying mantis to fit inside a case the size of a bar of hand soap. I once thought a backpacker couldn't find a better stove than a Svea. It was brass, the size and shape of a small coffee can, and stored liquid gas in a bottom tank. Surrounded by a formidable wind screen, its blue flame was befitting of a welder's torch and at full throttle it chugged like a locomotive. I carried one for years and it never let me down.The Svea's only drawback was it was difficult to light. It could have benefited by a thumb pump to push gas vapor up to the burner, where it could be ignited by a lit match. But the Swedes who designed it put their faith in physics instead. Their instructions to the hungry hiker were to cup the gas tank in his warm hands until Boyle's Law took over to induce the vapor stream. Right. Sure. Even on a hot day this didn't work. So, I invented my own ignition plan. I used an eyedropper to transfer a milliliter or two of liquid gas--I bow to metric units out of courtesy to the Swedes--to the burner and then ignite the tiny pool. After waiting a few seconds for heat of vaporization, I would open the main valve and--presto--the Svea roared to life. Sometimes the transfer volume was a tad much and the Svea was engulfed in an eyebrow-singeing towering inferno. For a moment you could read by the light of the flame it made. Every Svea owner I met had the same experience, as he would produce a stove that had been blackened by too many bonfire starts.Now I'm a Rocket Man.","
