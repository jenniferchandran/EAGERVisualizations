David Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518986,"I've been dreaming about a thru-hike since I was in Elementary School. Some forty years later, it's time. 2015 was a crappy year for me. It could easily be summarized by the classic blues song line, ""I've had lots of luck, and its all been bad."". In March, I ended up at Maine Medical Center with a collapsed lung. All filled up with a white gunk. When you hear a Doctor call another over and say, ""Wow, come look at this!"", it's not a good thing.   They drilled a hole in me, hooked up an elaborate series of hoses and pumps, and spent a week or so draining it away. One of the Docs said I had a 25 percent chance of dieing. Yikes.   That said, I had a fabulous team of medical professionals that took care of me and sent me on my way. Cost of my two week ""vacation"" was $75,000 dollars. Damn, could of charted a yacht in the Bahamas for all that money. Even after I left the hospital, I had a good couple months recuperating at home.   What made things most frustrating is that I could barely talk, as when the gunk filled my lung, it was so full it moved my vocal cord over a bit. For three or four months, I wondered if I would ever talk again. So I returned to work in a few weeks. I had left a secure job with Maine's largest electric utility, Central Maine Power Company, to work for a small consulting company.   They have a contract with a quasi government entity called Efficiency Maine, working with Commercial Customers in efficiency improvements. It was a dream job for me, and I felt very good about going to work each morning. Unfortunately, the manager at Efficiency Maine responsible for our program was a real moron. (e-mail me if you want his name) He was defective in managing the pipeline of jobs being approved, and by the time he woke up, not only had we spent the current years budget, but also half of the following years budget.   Yup, you guessed it, time to tighten up the belt... which in business lingo means, ""you need to cut your staff"".   I was the last one in, thus, got called in to Tim's office where he nervously had to deliver the bad news. ""You're done, effective right now"". Sweet. Not only had I accumulated medical bills, and left a stable position at CMP for this, I now found myself unemployed, with no medical benefits. (which I really needed to treat the collapsed lung thing)Over the next few months, I built my resume, submitted to hundreds of positions, had some job interviews, and as of today, still remained unemployed. I actually had five interviews with one company before being abandoned. Seems like companies don't want to hire a 53 year old person, despite his extensive experience, B.A. in Economics, and an M.B.A. So what now? I could pick up a ""you want fries with that?"" type of job. I can continue to be pissed off at life. Or I can go for a six month walk in the woods to contemplate things further. I can't wait.","

David Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518987,"So why now? An AT Thru Hike is quite a physical endeavor. I'm 53. The thought of waiting to do it until I ""retire"", which due to the setback of 2015 will likely be when I'm 65 or more, is daunting.   So I'm doing it now, while I still can (maybe) and have no other excuses.","

David Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519050,"I'm amazed by the number of views in the past 24 hours. Guess I had better tighten up my writing chops. 
I've decided to purchase a Z-Packs Arc-Haul Backpack and 20 degree sleeping bag. 
Purchasing ultralight not only reduces your pack weight, but also your wallet.","

David Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519460,"There are lots of gear options out there. I'm trying not to overthink them. Going to order a bunch of gear this week. - Henry Shires ""Notch"" tarp tent- Zpacks quilt- Zpacks pack- Zpacks food bag- Zpacks hat- probably some other Zpacks stuff as well. Hope Joe will give me a ride in the new boat I'll be helping him buy! - Darn Tuff socks- Ex-Officiado clothing- stick pic- marmot precip rain jacket and pants- some layers of clothing- hiking shoes... still not sure what to do here... LLBean is only 20 minutes from my house, so I'll go try out a bunch of stuff there. I'm trying to keep the pack light. Things I'd like to bring but aren't include: - ukulele- skillet- smoothie blender- cast iron pot- wood stove","

David Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519676,"This is a good news/bad news post. Good news is that after eight months of looking, I received a job offer that I could not refuse. Bad news. No thru-hike. I'll definitely be out on the trails in Maine this Summer and will do some trail magic to those thru-hikers that make it this far. It's still on my bucket list. But I have a daughter entering college in a year, and some bills to pay.    This job provides a decent salary, full boatload of benefits, and so on.   I can't pass it up.","

David Burke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519863,"At first I was a bit disappointed that a job fell in my lap and my thru hike had to be cancelled.   After several days thought, that disappointment has disappeared. I will have time off, and living in Maine, have access to some of the finest trails around. My goals for this year are to hike to Grafton Loop Trail, the Gulf Hagas Loop Trail, Caribou Mountain, and explore Acadia once again. It will give me a chance to test my gear, and see if I really want to do a thru hike in the future. A thru hike may be about endurance, but there are locals trails that are even better without the crowds. Thad said, good luck to this years thru-hikers.","
