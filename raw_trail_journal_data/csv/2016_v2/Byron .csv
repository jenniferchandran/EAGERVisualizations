Byron ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552514,"I have my gear for the most part. I still haven't slept outside in the tent or the bag but will do that soon. It's cold out there, 20 to 30 degrees. But I need to test it out. I can put up the tent now. I have a Big Agnes tent and a Radiant mummy bag from REI and an air mattress and fusion bag I was talked into while at REI. Sleep comfortable, it is important at our age he said. December 16, I hit 61 years of age. Damn that's old! Don't feel that old except after working a few days at the hardware store lugging around merchandise and walking miles on the concrete floor.I usually recover after a day of semi-rest. But if Ii have a few days rest I like walking a few miles in the hilly park here in NashvilleSo why the trail. I need to get out of the box more than anything. I mean, I like my comfortable life, the life I've lived for the last few years. But Im really by nature a wanderer. I've wandered to Japan, Thailand, California from Georgia, taking trips most years, unemployment for a couple, and teaching school. Money, money money.Look forward to hitting the trail, roughing it, and just walking, taking in the sights and sounds, meeting folks. What's the purpose? I don't know. What's the purpose for living. I don't know. I am here. So why sit around watching TV everyday? Or whatever. I'll figure it all out tomorrow!","Georgia
