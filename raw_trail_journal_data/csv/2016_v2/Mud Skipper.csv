The Scouts stayed up cooking and singing scout songs in the drizzling rain Next morning was very foggy and we went up to MAX PATCH. Foggy and windy and it seem like we were hiking in the clouds!. we hiked to Ground hog creek shelter and met ""Grouchy Pants"" and had a good time in that camp site. good water source up the hill and the boy liked the primitive outhouse. After a rough hike (up hill bothways) the scout Bus was a sight for sore eyes. We ended our journey with a feast at Arby's and Hardies.","LEMON GAP
