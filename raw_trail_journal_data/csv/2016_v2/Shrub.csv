Shrub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/453285,"Will be doing a lot of hiking this year to test out my stamina and gear, see what the two can take. Trips planned are in the Rangely me area, the whites and the Metacomet Monadnock trail. The trips will be in the 40 mile range with the exception of the trip to Monadnock which I believe is 114 miles. The focus will be on getting the daily mile count up to the 15 to 20 mile total. I know I can do big miles, I just don't know if I can do it day in day out. I guess I'll find out in about 11 months. Thanks to those who have posted on my journal.

Tried on several light weight boots but they didn't even come close to the asolos in support or comfort. The soles were not very grippy on the store rock. By comparison, the 520's felt like they could walk up the wall without slipping!Also bought a thermarest neoair xlite sleeping pad.

Doesn't take up much room and its pretty warm for the weight and price. Should work out ok under the rain jacket or by itself in camp. Don't think I'll hike in it, too warm. Just layer up while hiking! Reserved a bunk at the hiker hostel with their hiker special, pick up at the north marta, bunk and meal. Get dropped off near Springer the next day.

On a recent trip my hiking buddy was wearing his hoodini during a steady day long rain and it kept him bone dry. I was impressed and at 3 oz it seemed almost negligent not to buy it. So I bought it. When my rain jacket is too warm to wear, this looks like a viable alternative.","

I don't know if my stove and fuel bottle will make it thru the scrutiny and be confiscated or the pack itself will be damaged or lost. I'm leaning toward boxing it up fully packed with the exception of fuel and mailing it ups to the hiker hostel. I'll wear my hiking clothes and boots for the flight which will give me the added bonus of not having to mail anything home when I arrive! The only thing I will have on the plane is awols trail guide which will give me something to do during the flight. Only 69 days left of a career of 30 years. I will not miss going to work, I'll be too busy enjoying the fruits of my labor. My wife will also be retiring at the end of the school year and meeting up with me here and there. I will have 5 weeks before I leave to dehydrate food, box up mail drops and attend to various chores on the home front. See ya on the trail!","

Shrub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479135,"Now that I have decided on all my gear and purchased it, my attention has shifted to other matters. I've been plagued with a case of plantar faciitus since around July. Icing and stretching helped some but it was still painfull. So I had a stiffer pair of orthodics made which, once again, helped but didn't take care of the problem. My doctor then gave me a pair of booties to wear in the evening after icing to stretch the ligaments. I fondly call them my Forrest Gumpers. The right heel is now pain free but the left has not improved much. I also have been doing stretching exercises which seem to give some short time relief. Back to the Podiatrist. Considering I'll be on the trail in about 3 months, he gave me a shot of cordizone in the left heel to get this thing cleared up. I'll be seeing him again in a month for assessment and either a clean bill of health or another shot. One thing is certain, I'll be on the trail on March 24th. I will be taking it easy as far as prep hikes go for the duration but after that its full speed ahead!   ","

Shrub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479482,"Went crazy at the grocery store yesterday. Bought enough energy bars and snickers to cover me for almost the entire trip. Also bought enough food for about 20 weeks worth of meals. Most are Knorr sides, pasta, rice, mashed potato and couscous. I'll be dehydrating up a storm after I retire on 2-13. I borrowed a couple of dehydrators so I'll have 3 of them going at once. Next stop will be staples and the post office to see which will be best for getting boxes for mail drops. Lastly, I'll get all the drop boxes filled, labeled and ready to be sent. Originally, I had planned on only about 9 drops, but it seemed like everywhere I'll be staying accepts drops. I figured my time would be better spent pounding food and beer down in town than wandering around Walmart, which I've never been in, or some other food store. Can barely contain myself, getting sooo close! --- Shrub","

Shrub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480090,"I was going to take advantage of the cold weather in ma. to spend the night in the tent and to see if my sleeping bag could still cut it. I'v got a nf cats meow 20* bag which has worked well for me. I was going to use it for the first part of the trip but when I put all my gear in the backpack, I had a hard time getting everything in. The cats meow took up a lot of space and its 20 years old so there was some question in my mind as to its ability to keep me warm. So after arguing with myself for a while, I convinced the part of my brain that doesn't like spending money to loosen up, a lot! I bought a bag from Feathered Friends. It's the swallow UL 20* bag. 900 fill, weighs in at 1lb. 10ozs and once packed in its stuff sack its 7x12 in. I figure in a compression sack I can get that size down to a smaller footprint and free up a lot of space in my pack. The cost was, with a 10L OR air purge compression sack about $500. A lot of cash but this bag will last the rest of my life, which will be a very long time I hope. 56 days to Springer, can't wait to start running into some trail mates!","

Only things left to do are repackage food for drop boxes and UPS pack to the Hiker Hostel. This retirement thing is still a little surreal. Hard to believe after 47 years I won't be punching a card.

I sent my backpack to Georgia. A year and a half of planning, 44 years of waiting, countless backpacking trips, section hikes, ice climbing, rock climbing, winter mountaineering, and, of course, day hikes, have brought me to the cusp of a dream! I'm going to thru hike the A.T. Did I forget to pack something, Oh well, I'll buy it when I can't find it in my pack. Didn't do my homework on a piece of equipment, Oh well, I'll figure it out before I get to Katahdin!

What a pain in the ass those turned out to be. Hopefully it will have been worth it. I ended up with 12 boxes, after that I'll be resupplying as I go. Once I get up around n.y. or ct my wife Sue will be seeing me about once a week so resupply will be easy. Got the dentist and doctor visits out of the way. Meds are updated and precautionary scripts have been bought. I can't think of anything I may have missed but I know that something was overlooked or forgotten. 11 days and it all starts.

Had laundry to do, resupply for the next 2 days and rest the body. Went to an ace breakfast at the 1st Baptist chuch. They picked us up at the Inn and drove us to their church hall. All you can eat pancakes, bacon, juice and coffee. They brought us back to the Inn after eating a pile of food. I think the hiker appetite is kicking in. Did laundry on site at the inn. Roadrunner told us there was a free lunch going on at an outfitter store in town so at noon we walked the half mile to the store and enjoyed ace hotdogs and chips and soda. They also had a small draft beer room neededwhich I couldn't resist an ipa waiting for lunch. Most of the hikers from our bubble were there. A bubble is a group of hikers who are doing the same milage so you see each other at the shelters and towns. On the way back to the Inn I picked up a six pack to split with Denmark. At 4:00 we were shuttled to Walmart to rwsupply. Now, I have never set foot in a Walmart before today because they are evil. However, I needed food and that was my option so what can I SAY. In the same area was an ace Chinese place so it was another food orgy. Nice thing about hiking every day, you can eat very large amounts of food and lose weight.

We stuck around for about a half hour and it being 3:30, we decided to keep hiking to the next shelter about 5.5 miles further.

They had soda, juices, candy, cookies, summer sausage.Dinner was baked potato, steak and grilled asperagus. We only stayed for about 40 minutes. Ate, had a couple of beers, raided the to go box and hit the trail with a little spring to our step. If I had 1 more beer, I think I would have been putting my tent up and indulging all evening.

Woke up freezing, put on what little clothing I had and that worked till about 3:00 am; I was not very comfortable after that. Started out at 8:00 and warmed right up! Another cold and wet day, gives you the incentive to keep moving. Climbed up St John's Ledges, very steep rocky ledge, hiking sticks were useless as it was hand over hand climbing. Staying at Wiley Shelter.","Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter

Shrub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515558,"Up and hiking at 9:00. Only going about 10.0 miles again. Feeling good, taking my time. Will be finished with Ct. today and into NY. Nice day today. sun was out with a nice breeze, perfect hiking weather. Last night was cold again but I put my silk bag liner in my sleeping bag and that made the difference. Still had all my clothes on but I wasn't cold. One person at the shelter when I got there. Made my first fire since I started in March. No youngsters making fires anymore. Cool! Water has been a problem, or I should say the lack of water. Some trail angles have left water caches along the trail so I camel up and fill my 3 liters. The guide book says there is water but when you get there the source is dry.   ","Schaghticoke Mt Campsite

Shrub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515834,"Did 14.4 miles today. Last night I set up my tent in the grass behind the parks concession bld. too bad it was closed. About 8:00 pm I hear a car pull in. It was the night watchman. They have a lot of renovations going on and some heavy equipment, hence the watchman. He must sleep all night because I never saw him the whole night! I was packed up and moving at 7:00 am, just as the construction crew was pulling in. Packed a wet tent, lots of dew settled on the Finding water is proving tough. Sources are few and far between. Arrived at a Franciscan monastery. They let hikers sleep at the monastery's ballfield where they have a pavilion with lights and outlets. I set up my tent outside the bld. and prepared my dinner in the pavilion and charged up my phone and I-pod.","Clarence Fahnestock state park

Shrub,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517162,"My quest to finish the trail this year is over. Only made it to NJ my 2nd time out. My knees were killing me and I believe I contracted Giardia somewhere in NY. I either boiled or filtered everything but must have cross contaminated something. I will finish up sometime next spring. Had a great time on the trail and met a lot of really nice people. Now I get to spend the winter anticipating finishing the last 500 miles and since I'm starting in NJ and heading south, I don't think I'll encounter the mob that is predicted for next year. See ya on the trail next year!","Graymoor spiritual life center
