JustPlainSandi -AT Class '16,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/124528,"13 months 2 days until ""Hike off"".I can't believe that I am actually doing this. I am. I need to. I'm afraid. I'm excited.I've been reading and reading and reading. I try not to hit the denial mode - ""It won't happen to me."" - when I read about the negatives. ie: blisters, exhausted, want to quit, run out of water, etc. I can't think it won't because it might and then what? If I quit will I be a failure because I didn't finish? Or will I be a winner because at least I tried?Questions, always more questions bring themselves to the forefront of my mind.Why am I doing this? Why am I contemplating walking over 2,000 miles with all of life in a pack on my back? Is it a romantic thought? Am I thinking idyllically? I don't think so. I don't WANT to think so. I am a romantic at heart, though, so I might be.My trip idea actually started in High School when other kids rode their bikes across the United States and had their pictures taken on the White House steps. My brother and a couple of his friends rode their bikes across Canada. I will admit that there was some jealousy. I have never heard about his whole trip and someday I would like to sit and hear it. I didn't want to just ride a bike, though. I wanted to walk. All the way across the United States. It didn't seem practical, though.As years went by, it redefined itself into the Appalachian Trail. However, my husband didn't want to hike it and thought that I was crazy to want to. So, I stuffed the ""want to"" down and tried to not think about it. It's very hard to not think about something that jumps out at you in bits and pieces. It's weird how little things made me think of the Trail (always capitalized). I used to always wear dresses and would find myself wondering how one could climb rocks in a dress. I started wearing pants. I thought about food and began eating more healthily in order to be able to hike further. I thought about shelter. I thought about the Appalachian Trail off and on for 20+ years, and always thought that it would only be a dream.Until 2003 when said husband wanted his own life and I helped him pack for it. The first year that he was gone was a year of readjusting and finding out who I am. I made a list of everything that I ever liked to do and ever wanted to do. I set out to find out if they were still wants and dreams. I learned to drive a semi and did it. Drove many places that crossed the AT and began thinking about IT again. Quit driving after 5 months. Like the driving, hate the job.So...am I a failure because I quit or a winner because I tried? Again that old question. One thing that I will say, I gained confidence in learning to do that very hard thing!Last January the Dream of the AT woke up again with a vengence! I would lurk AT sites. But, I was afraid to tell anyone what I really wanted to do because I just don't like the thought of rejection. And then, like a clear and cool stream on hot feet, I realized that I NEEDED to hike the Trail. If no one likes the fact that I am doing it, that's fine. I am going to hike it. I don't want to wake up one day and realize that I am at the end of my life and didn't do the one thing that I wanted to do the most because I was afraid of ""What if"". So, what IF I get bit by a rattle snake? What if I DON'T? What IF I get lost? What if I DON'T? What if I don't go and in my home I get electrocuted. A thousand what if's and I am never going to be afraid of ""what if"" again!SO, let the chips fall where they may, I am planning and learning and reading and watching DVDs and taking mini hikes and doing sit ups and running and I took a Wilderness First Aid course just in case that snake DOES bite me.When I tell people, I honestly hope that they think it's great, but if they don't it's ok, too. It's ME that's hiking. It's ME that is going to be facing the the hardest thing I have ever done.I'm not starting alone. My friend, Amy, has decided that she is wanting to walk with me. We will learn about ourselves and face the journey the best way that journeys can be faced....with a friend.",,View Entry,"Feb 13, Mon",0
JustPlainSandi -AT Class '16,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/124582,"On my kitchen window sill I have a framed quote by Theodore Roosevelt. I found it at a Thrift Store. It's not what I was looking for, but every day of my life, it's just what I need........""The credit belongs to those who are actually in the arena, who strive valiantly; who know the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spend themselves in a worthy cause; who at the best, know the triumph of high achievement; and who, at the worst, if they fail, fail while daring greatly, so that their place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.""I am in the middle of dehydrating shrimp. I marinated it in soy sauce and popped it in with my almost finished beef jerky. I am planning to rehydrate it with some rice and vegetables. Eventually. I try all of this stuff and sometimes not even my cats will eat it. :::Sigh::: The cats. I have to find new homes for my cats. Jack, Bobby and Peewee have been my friends since the day that Jeff left 2 and a half years ago. They provided laughter when I needed it. Jack rode in the truck with me. I feel so sad at having to give them up. Princess, Elbie and Toby came to me as teeny-weeny kittens found in the woods. The ""big boys"" and I nursed them to health and I can't imagine life without Princess purr-talking to me! Allie is afraid of her own shadow but she loves to be pet. They are family and have interacted with each other and me almost their whole lives and here I am planning to give them away so that I can chase my dream. Am I being selfish? For all that I love them, they are destructive critters and although I can't imagine life without them, I would love to not eat cat hair with every bite! I can't find any one person to take all of them. I've put flyers up, but was only able to find homes for 2. I don't miss them much and maybe it will as easy for the rest. But, I doubt it. The ones who are still here are MY cats. I think about looking into boarding them and then I ask myself if I am crazy. I almost thought about putting Jack back in his harness and leash training him, but that really wouldn't be sensible. If he got tired of walking, that would be another 15 pounds for me to carry....not going THERE!I am selling my home, quitting my job, and finding new homes for my pets. All to walk two thousand and some more miles. This is real for me.Some day, I will look back at think, ""It was worth it!"" But right now, it's scary and sad and exciting and a whole lot of other adjectives that I can't think of.The people that I have had the hardest time telling about hiking the Trail are my family. Amazing. I tell strangers and friends and acquaintances and dogs and squirrels and everyone else I meet ""I'm planning to hike the Appalachian Trail next year!"" But it was hard to tell my mother who thinks that it's crazy; or my kids who really aren't sure if I'm packing a full load. But, I've told them and whether they accept it or not, I will keep telling them until it's reality for them, too. Wouldn't it be cool if some of my family wanted to come along with me? For even part of the way?Who knows, maybe they will.",,View Entry,"Feb 14, Tue",0
JustPlainSandi -AT Class '16,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/125212,"Well, I guess that I need to explain that I am not selling my house in order to hike the Trail. I am actually hiking the Trail because I am selling my house.  It's part of the Divorce that I have to move out of my home and find somewhere to live in this overpriced and underpaid world. The attachment to my home is a little strong, but selling it is bearable knowing that at the end is my long awaited DREAM. Springer Mountain is luring me, calling me. How he ever knew my name, I will never know. I breathe in and breathe out the Appalachian Trail.  The shrimp that I dehydrated actually tasted ok. I rehydrated some of them with some rice and vegetables and they weren't bad. There, I've got a meal that I created myself. I've bought some spices to work with as I test out different recipes. I'm dehydrating oranges right now. I'm not thinking that I'll have great results since an orange is 95% water. But after I had them on the trays drying, I found a recipe for honeyed orange peel. Now THAT looks promising! I promise, I'll try it next.  Well, officially 2 of my cats have homes, and 4 are in the Shelter looking for homes, with the agreement that I can get them if they DON'T find homes. I found a boarding home-pet vacation place that will ""only"" charge me $3500 for two cats for 7 months. I can imagine that if I only had 1 or two cats that I could easily find a friend to ""board"" them, but 8 is asking too much. It has been a very emotional week as I am missing my pets. I am keeping two. I couldn't part with them all. I've cried and stayed wake in the night thinking about them, and I wonder if there has been anyone else who has felt this loss this deeply in order to fulfill their dream. There must be someone, somewhere.....  I've watched videos and read journals and books. I've been studying the Thru-Hikers guidebook, and the planner, and the Databook. I've studied gear until I have them all mixed up. I am on 3 lists, although only two are active...the Women's Hikers list and the UltraLightweightbackpacking list (I think that that's it). I'm thinking about mail-dropping; and I'm thinking about re-loading at stores instead. I have friends saving 1/4 rolls of toilet paper. (Mountain Money!) I'm making lists of outfitters to ""regear"" if I need to along the way. I've picked up boxes from the PO and am ""hiding"" some of the foods that I am dehydrating now to see if they will be good 7 months from now, or should I depend on a friend to prepare meals for me. I'm beginning to put boxes together for maildrops...toilet paper, soap, paper, pencil, etc. This and that and that and this. So many decisions! Do I really have enough time?? Will I be ready when it's time??  I may put off the Trail for a week or two in order to take a 9 week course that I wanted to take. Initially I was wavering because I wanted to start on the 15th and it didn't get finished on the 20th. I think that that extra week wouldn't hurt me, and I just might regret not taking the course. The Trail won't leave with out me. So....still considering my options.  I have friends and family getting more and more interested (""REALLY? THAT'S COOL!"") I've answered questions, I've directed people to Jan Liteshoe's journal (I don't know how to add the link here, sorry) and more and more friends are seeing that it really does sound like me. Amy seems to have the fever. Good. A friend from church was very excited to have bought me a Thru-Hiker's guide from the 80's. I told her that I had this year's book, but I was so thankful that she thought of ME! So, she's decided to read it, and maybe she and her husband will hike a section. HEY! Maybe with me! That would be awesome.  My 30-year High School reunion will fall during my hike. Is it still a thru-hike, if I leave the Trail for a week, fly to California and attend the Reunion and then fly back to where I left the trail? It's still the same year. (oh please say yes LOL)  So, I'm still planning for next year, but wishing it was THIS year. But in 12 months and 17 days, (or maybe 24 days) it will be ""this year's hike"", so I need to get ready! Y'all have a great one!",,View Entry,"Feb 27, Mon",0
JustPlainSandi -AT Class '16,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/125392,"I think that I may be the only one excited by this. LOL A friend of mine has promised me an endless supply of toilet paper quarter-rolls. I have been asking people to save me that last quarter of their rolls. No way can I save 7 months of paper in the year that I have left. So, that's what friends are for - right? So, ask and ye shall receive. Yippee!  I have a ""trying out my boots"" hike next weekend. Yes, it's in Florida....but so am I. My only ""ups"" around here are located on and off I-95. How do I explain that one to the nice officer who stops me? ""Uh, no, really, I'm not hitchhiking, I'm practicing mountain climbing for the Appalachian Trail."" I think I might find myself in a rubber room. So.....I'm going on a 13 mile hike in Ocala with some members of the Sierra Club.  I'm trying to break the boots in at work, but delivering pizzas in my work shorts and hiking boots makes me feel rather like Daisy Mae. The weird thing is that they feel great on my feet, my LEGS get tired of hauling the heavy weight around on my feet. Hmmm....maybe it's a GOOD thing!  12 months 16 days.

JustPlainSandi -AT Class '16,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/125484,"I've been thinking lately abut how I view things.Major events are viewed as capital letters. MARRIAGE, DEATH, DIVORCE, HIKE. I think them in big letters as if they alone are epic sagas in my journey of life.But, then, I started thinking that maybe I have it backwards! Maybe it should be LIFE and all of the events, marriage, death, divorce, hike, etc are just steps in the journey.I am planning to hike all of the Trail. Along the way, I will stay at shelters sometimes, tent camp sometimes, hostel sometimes and hotel sometimes, but all of it will be a part of the Trail as I hike towards my goal of Katahdin. I may get off sooner than I think I will. Katahdin is my goal, but it may not be my stopping place.What if, the Trail is a picture of LIFE? Marriage, divorce, death, children, financial stress or freedom, happiness, sadness, success or failure...all of these are steps along the journey of Life. A good long life and eventually Heaven are my goals, but what if my stopping place is sooner than I expected? I STILL had the journey of life and the steps in it!Paul said in Hebrews, ""Let us run with patience the race that is set before us; laying aside every weight and the sin that doth so easily beset us....."" yep, Step by step, I think that the TRAIL is a great picture of LIFE.",,Ponderance,"Mar 02, Thu",0

I don't have a tent or sleeping bag yet, nor do I have socks, boots, any winter stuff or really any sense.  So far, everything in that pack is almost 13 pounds. Not including food or water or sleeping system or the clothes I am going to need for my start.  Maybe I'm paranoid. Maybe I am not sure what I fear the most.  Losing everything so I want to take everything so I won't lose it?  Being cold?  Cutting myself?  Not being able to clean up properly?  I don't know. I know that I have to think and rethink all of this STUFF. Why do I need all of this stuff? See if you can help me.... my pack is 4 lbs and I'll have to use it for this hike  foam sleeping pad - full length 6 oz  ground cloth (I cut a shower curtain in half) 7 oz  lighter - 1 oz  knife - 1 oz  spoon - less than 1 oz  sink (LOL)yes, a sink - 8 oz Bible - 14 oz  playing cards - 3 oz  bug spray - 1 oz  camp towel (I cut it so that I have a wash rag and a towel) - 1 oz  headnet - less than 1 oz  baseball cap - 1 oz  fire starters - 3 oz  Isopro fuel canister (full) - 11 oz  pocket rocket stove - 3 oz  oral hygiene stuff - 3 oz  first aid kit (including plastic container) - 2 oz  headlamp - 4 oz  mylar blanket 1 oz  water treatment system - (will probably switch to good old fashioned bleach) - 2 oz  25 ft rope - 2 oz  30 SUV sunblock - 8 oz  Camp soap (washes me and my clothes and my hair or what's left after Locks of Love gets theirs) - 4 oz  sit upon/pillow - 1 oz  cook pans and salt&pepper - 4 oz  rain poncho - 2 oz scarf and hat ala Liteshoe - 4 oz  camp shoes (Croks) - 8 oz  that's it.

JustPlainSandi -AT Class '16,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/126572,"I have a very hard time finding good training grounds here in Florida. The on and off ramps just don't cut it.So, I took a long walk on the beach today. It was so lovely. I stopped and bought a slice of pizza from Bizarro's and ate it while I walked. I love Bizarros...you can't go to Melbourne Beach without stopping at Bizarros....it's a tradition. I had to go to the bathroom, (I almost thought about the cathole idea, and decided that it just wouldn't be cool on the beach with people around) so I turned around and walked back and into a little ice cream shop where they make all of their ice cream fresh daily. I had banana ice cream with a 1/2 banana cut into it. Very good. And they sang me this dopey song. They sing it to every customer. ""This is our ice cream song, it isn't very long ....."" and then two more lines. I looked at them and laughed. I couldn't help it.  Then I asked if they would sing me their napkin song because there were no napkins. They said that they didn't HAVE a napkin song....so I used their tune and sang, ""There's going to be a mess, dribbles run down my dress, I'll have a messy face, no napkins in this place."" (The tune is ""Howdy Doody"") I was hastily handed a napkin. hah hah hah As I walked out of the ice cream place, I saw something that I haven't seen since I was a kid in Puerto Rico....I watched the moon rise over the ocean. Oh...lovely. God spoiled me with delicious ice cream, a nice long walk, and a moon rise...oh and a silly song. All in one day. I guess that it has now been proven that I, of course, am His favorite kid. I'll pray for you to be able to withstand the jealousy.Heh heh heh  A friend told me about a rock climbing place around here so I can practice my mountain climbing. Hey, gotta use what you have, right? It's not hiking, but it IS climbing, so I can use those muscles.  My youngest son, Andy - the Marine, called and said, ""Mom, you do realize that you need to be training, right?"" I told him that I really just thought that I would sit on my butt for the next year and then all of a sudden decide to go walk 2000 miles. Everyone is an expert.  Ah, that's ok....maybe I can get some of these experts out with me.  I've been told that I need to carry at least 50 pounds. I've been told that I need to carry a satellite phone. You should SEE the first aid stuff that people think I need to take with me. I can't wait to get out of the advice columns and hit the Trail.  12 months 9 days - and I am still His favorite kid.

I couldn't finish planning my Hike until I knew when our reunion was....and since I needed to plan, I decided to take the bull by the horns and DO it!  Sometimes ya just gotta DO it!  In the meantime, I've been walking and walking, either at my Super Wal~Mart or at the beach. 6 miles is no longer a burn for me....at least not at Wal~Mart. 3 miles at the beach still causes bruning in my calves. My goal is to work my way up to 10 miles at the beach, because then I will have a chance on the uphills.  I've changed my leave-date yet again. In order to be back in California for 14 days, (including air time) I need to leave earlier. I am not going to make it to the intern program that I wanted to take. Money is too tight, and the time constraints are too pressing. So, I am changin my leave date....once again....to March 1, 2007. Hopefully this one will work. It will give me time to travel to Sac, days off if I need them on the Trail and lazy days to view the sights. I really want this to be The Trip of My Lifetime since I have wanted it all my life! My next most important thing to do is to get divorced. That's happening without me having to do anything but show up at the appointed times at the appointed places and be civil to the man who was most uncivil to me for 17+ years. The best thing that I can say about him is that he cured me of thinking that I need a romantic relationship in my life! Maybe by the time I end the Trail, I will have learned why I felt that I needed a toxic relationship in the first place!  Well, that's it for today. I wanted to check in. I am still here. Still planning. I am reading a bunch of March 1 from different years, and then March 2 from different years so I can find out what the weather can range. I need to figure out mpd so that I can decide mail drops and town visits. I need to find out where the internet places are in the towns so that I can plan to spend days connecting. So much to do....so little time!  I LOVE IT!  One more thing before I finish. Amy is still planning to come. BUT, having said that, I have decided to continue planning my hike. I don't know what tomorrow holds....but I do know that if I wait for someone else to do what I need to do, nothing is going to happen and I will waste my life being a lady-in-waiting.

This may seem like a little thing to most of the people reading this...but for me it was major. I sigh of longing, a breath of desire.  I've been so caught up in planning my 30-year reunion, getting divorced, looking for a home and everything else going on in my hectic life that I had almost lost site of the vision. I'm visiting Jamie and Gavin in Westfield, Massachusetts for Gavin's 3rd birthday. I've missed all the rest, and really felt like I needed to be here this year. I quit my job last Friday and headed up here Saturday. (Ok, I quit my job because I'm moving, too! I found 10 acres in Oregon that has a creek and a cabin and my name written all over it.)I wanted a place that they could meet me next year while I am hiking my Hike. So, I drove west on US20 and found Lee, Mass...about 2 miles from Upper Goose Pond. There was a parking area and a trail head. So.....I put a water bottle in my pocket and headed up the Trail. I wanted to head south....I thought I was headed south. Then, I started thinking about it and realized that since West was *that* way, and east was *THAT* way, then, by golly....I wasn't headed south! And I wonder why they call me ""Wrong Way"" LOL I was already pretty far up the hill, so decided to keep going.It was so very peaceful and serene. I took my shoes off about 1/2 up (I was wearing birks....not for hiking in...to be sure!) and realized how much I love walking barefoot....even on the Trail.   I sat down and smelled and listened.Yes, it's my Dream. I know that I'll need to work on getting more fit. I'll need to take it slow next year at first...had to take it slow this time. I do have asthma and I needed to stop and slow my breathing...but it's do-able and I found that if I paid attention to my ""body-language"" I didn't need the inhaler. My goal is to finish what I start, so I am going to need to listen to my body the whole way. I saw blue blazes and white blazes...and each blaze was exciting to me because I had never seen them...I took a picture of one that I will attempt to upload when I get home. I didn't see people. I know that hikers had been through at some point because there were leaves freshly knocked to the ground. Maybe next year I'll be with hikers when I come through...at least until I stop for the day or two to spend with Jamie and Gavin.But, for this year....I know where I am and what I need to do. And that is get ready for the carrying out of my dream. Finish planning. I've stepped back from the reunion planning and am putting it into good hands. This event comes first.
