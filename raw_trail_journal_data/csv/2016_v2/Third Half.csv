Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532179,"On the trail by 7am. 10 miles by lunch. Same as always with Charlie. The trail is pretty easy, relatively speaking. We hiked across one mtn and then up to the blue ridge. Lots of ridge walking, half smooth tread, half rocky. In a misty cloud all day - it got pretty cold on the windy side. Physically I feel pretty good; everything hurts the same. Charlie seems good: pretty mellow. Rhododendron, wild azalea (not orange), and mountain laurel all in various bloom.

Charlie watched on radar and we waited til it broke to pack up. my stuff got pretty dirty in splash zone but important stuff stayed dry. Hiked in mist then clear. Short hike (10) to meet ken,Lotta, and Peggy for four days hiking. lotta made great meal for us all; ken drove straight from NYC. They all hunkered down under a pavilion to avoid oncoming storm; I stayed in tent site. I'm feeling good and relieved of the need to _______ (fill in the blank).

Camped at stealth spot next to Sunset Field on blue ridge pkwy. Thinking a slow trip up the blue ridge in a van is in my future some autumn. Invasive garlic mustard is pervasive on many slopes. Rained really hard last night - had me sitting up in my tent wide-eyed from the lightning. All was well. Clear most of the day; a big, violent storm just missed us to the west and north about 6 pm. Thinking about music theory all day. Did a haiku on standard guitar tuning: Every Altruistic Deed Gives Back Everything.

Much of what we hiked today was ripped up by micro-bursts - some limbs down but mostly new green leaves littering the ground (more than last year's leaffall) when it's not raining its pretty hot and sunny without leaves on mtns. My south Asian rice farmer hat is great in rain, Sun, and conversation. I'm really glad I got nephew Kurt to 're-lend it to me this year. Ill try and post some pics when I figure that out. Trilliums and mayflower abundant today. Water is abundant needless to say. Had a good hiking day with all; Charlie's last.

Lots of ups (3500' up) - tough climbs but good switchback so just had to pace and breathe. Last two days came down then up James river valley, 4 miles wide. Longest pedestrian bridge on AT.

Stopped at us 60 @ men's car. I got my food drop transferred and off they went and up the mountain I went, cold and wet. I did get a banana and 7up trail magic in parking lot (thanks Storm) 3000' ascent. I'm stealth camping @ 4000' peak. I'm feeling pretty strong hiking and managing water and food well. Rain is a bit of a drag but it'd probably bother me more after I'm out for awhile. Very few hikers out and about - I am in front of the bubble by design. It's cold this afternoon (40's) and moist but rain seems to be subsiding. I'm dry in my tent - thank goodness I brought my silk liner for cold.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532194,Long day of small ups and downs. 3500' up and 3500' down (progress?) It rained all day and night. I started in the clouds and finished in the clouds. It was cold enough I didn't stop for fear of hypo-thermia. Cold and wet; bad combo. Plus at one point it started hailing on me. Not like thunderstorms hail; more like hard snow. So I figured the best thing to do in the cold and wet is hike. I'm bedded down and I think the rain may be over and beautiful tomorrow. It'll be low 40's tonight. George wash Nat forest is nice. Saw 4-5 red gets on trail yesterday. Tomorrow will be last 4000' elevation on AT until whites of my; bigelows of me for me.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532195,Today was a tough and beautiful day. Last nite got down to said 38 said the ridgerunner. I was comfy in my tent with silk liner and down bag. The rain stopped and skies were mostly clear. Hiking temps were 60's. Great weather. Hike was tough: almost 8000' vertical. That is at the high end of the scale. I'm beginning to think that's the best metric of difficulty. Lots of rock scrambling on top of elevation change and my feet were challenged. But my spirits are high. Late start - piddled around and didn't walk til 10:30. I like breaking routine. Poured hot chocolate mix on my peanut butter tortilla to help get it down. Think ill back off the pb for awhile although it's hi carb/g. Trail magic today : former pct thru gave an apple mid-hike. Helped a lot.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533491,"Today was another Nero (7.5) out of town to first shelter in Shenandoah Park. The shelter is packed with others also just having left town. There are at least 15 people here. I'm stashed in my tent. It's cold ( we're in the clouds) and it's supposed to rain tonight. Most of the nobo's will probably do big miles tomorrow and the section hikers short. I may do medium; just have to see what the weather is like and how I feel. I'm trying doing journal entry directly into my kindle for latertransfer. There is no writer on this device so I'm using the note writer on the calendar. That may be the only way without loading an app. Seems to be working. SNP is going to be a little different. They make you register (no fee) and they're pretty strict about where you can camp. Water is less plentiful and there's less wilderness. There's the Skyline Drive with several campgrounds, lodges, waysides, and stuff like power lines and communication towers. I haven't really seen it yet so it'll change, but the mountains aren't as tall and the woods seem like younger growth so far. The vegetation mid-story is dense and gnarly; probably good bear habitat. So far few large trees and a couple of the 'summits' are maintained bald. The early section seemed to be in mid-succession toward forest but was still early. Funny, I didn't see a single hiker; then they all showed up between 4-5 pm. Nice folks and everyone seems very positive and upbeat, although they're getting tired of the coldrain. I had a really powerful dream last night. I was hanging around a couple of guys and they said, hey let me show you our family pictures. The picture they showed me was taken in my parents house (long ago). Irecognized my folks but no one else. They began to point to each person, name them, and then, as they described each of their tragic deaths, that person's image would fade. Finally only these guys and my folks were left in the photo unfaded. Somehow it became clear that these were distant relatives but I didn't get to meet those who were passed. The emotion (isn't that what dreams really are) was overwhelming. I awoke to a desperately deep sense of sadness for not having shared life with some of my kinfolk coupled with joy at having discovered they existed. Maybe Ishouldn't eat calzone and antipasto salad right before going to sleep.Town day was over. I'm glad to be back on the trail.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533492,"A long, relatively easy day. The Shenandoah Park trail is groomed by the Potomac club. Lots of up and down but never long slogs or too rocky. I made 13 miles by lunch and finished last 6 miles in just over 2 hours. I tried to make it to a wayside for a burger but they're just getting cranking and closed early. Plus loft mtn was a whiteout so I wasn't willing to walk an extra 1.1 in the rain for a burger. These are the choices it comes down to. I plan on going for breakfast tomorrow am off a spur trail a couple miles north on AT. Dogwoods and azalea are in bloom and the woods are beautiful. I guess yesterday was the entrance tothe park and not representative. Today was much nicer. Most of the day it rained. It was a misty morning stroll in the park in the clouds followed by rain walking. In the pm it cleared for a while but then really socked in late afternoon. The cloud I'm in finally broke and I got to see sunset from inside my tent. I had no idea which direction it would set when I set up in the rain. Physically tired but everything is holding together well. I dodged a problem in town the other day: I bought new insoles at the outfitter. They offered more cushion protection on the frontof my feet; important for rocks. But they also had more structure in the arch and heel. I molded them by putting them in the oven and wore them around town. Too much structure. I'm certain my feet would have been screaming if I would have tried to hike in them. So I returned them on myway out of town. Soon ill have to get my next pair of treksta shoes as my current pair are giving it up. Ill keep looking for more support, hopefully before Pennsylvania (rocksylvania).Tomorrow is two weeks on trail. I feel like I'm just getting started but already approaching 20% of my trip. I'm happy taking one day at a time.","Cow Mtn Shltr

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533493,"The only thing better than the pancakes and bacon I walked an extra 1.6 miles for this morning was the mayonnaise packet I added to my summer sausage on tortilla for lunch. The Fritos and snickers I scored in the wayside were a close second. On another lousy weather day, high-calorie food becomes the highlight. I know my friend Jeff C will geta big kick out of the unusual (for me) things we eat out here. Among the top-five cal/oz foods are peanut butter, snickers, freetos, and olive oil. I carry and eat all of those. It was pretty nice weather this morning but the fog and clouds piled in quickly. I don't know if it's possible, but it seemed like thick clouds at the top, then slight clearing going downhill, then heavy fog at lower elevation. I couldn't quite figure out the physics of that. Less than a mile from the hut where I planned to tent, it started to rain and didn't let up. So I set up in the rain; a highly specialized process which involves several stages of unpacking and gradually getting into the tent (dry on the inside), getting out of wet clothes, jackets, etc., getting the sleeping pad blownup, and hunkering down in the sleeping bag to dry your wet undies and t-shirt while waiting for the rain to stop without getting chilled. That's just what you do if you don't like shelters (I don't) and you don't want walk anymore and it's raining and cold. So it was a good day although I was in a near white-out all day.","Loft Mtn Campground

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533494,"Culture shock: I'm in a natl park campground. Music, crying babies, dogs, .... But I pushed through today 20 miles so I could getthat hamburger I missed out on the other day. And resupply so I can keep moving through the park. It was a tale of two days: I stayed in the tent late after on and off rain all nite hoping to get some sun to dry things out. Then it rained again. So I started walking, planning to do ashort day to rest my feet a little and because these park regulations make it kinda weird to figure out stops (difficult stealths). It was misty and rainy all morning until just before lunch. Then the skies blew open and I saw blue for the first time in a while. My lunch was really pleasant and I became motivated to do another 10. Hiking conditions this afternoon were ideal. Mid -60's and crystal clear. The tread was smooth (mostly) and the grades were gentle (mostly). I sailed into the wayside @ 5:30 and they were still serving. Oh boy. I ate, powered up my device,and did a quick 2-day resupply, then walked to the campground. Yesterday I walked through the recent wildfire area that had closed a sectionof the AT. They re-opened it last week so I got to observe the fire results. It was probably a really good thing ecologically but freaked everyone around here out. Later in the day I came upon two deer grazing rightin the trail. They were completely unfazed by me and I had to coax themto move. No bears yet; I'm over halfway through the park. Maybe tomorrow.Hello to Ronnie and Ray in Palm Bay. Ronnie, I hope you don't mind: Steve was with me today. I know you miss him. We all do. Hiking isgood for clearing things out.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533496,"Note to self: don't stay in natl park campground again. 11-yr old running and screaming til 10, college-age talking and laughing around fire til midnight, 2 hrs of coffee-induced fitfulness, cryingbaby 2-3, idiot revving his diesel @ 6. Oh well; I got up and out early. And it was a beautiful morning. Crisp and clear. In the first mileI saw two deer and then, yes, my first AT bear. He was mid-size and mellow. We both seemed content to just stare at one another for awhile. Then he went back to sniffing around and I went on walking. A very beautiful animal. I felt just a bit like I was invading his space at first, but in the end, I wound up feeling more like him than the tourists. Thru-hikers seem to be a curiosity very similar to bears. People talk about their appearance, habits, and way. Nothing negative; it's just thatthe tourists only come a little bit out of their bubble while the hikersubstantially leaves his behind. Well, it's raining again. I got in 14 miles by 1:15 and the front arrived @ 1:30. I got my tent up and I'm hunkered down for the duration. They say it's going into the 30's tonight. Should be nice tomorrow though. Today's trail was the opposite of yesterday: it was rocky (mostly). Tough on the feet. That appears to be thelimiting factor for hiking for me: my feet. They just get tired. Everything else is holding up. Ergo only 14 today: vying for a little rest andrecovery. Shenandoah Park really is beautiful and it's wonderful to see people out walking and enjoying the park experience.

Fortunately I was tented just off the ridge on the leeward slope so I was pretty calm. The wind continued most of the day. It felt like it got colder as the day progressed (it was mid-30's last night). I started out with pants on under my shorts and my long woolen shirt over my t-shirt. I took of the extra layer around 10 (started @7) and got too cold so I added my long sleeve shirt. Did 12 miles by noon and went into my last Shenandoah wayside for a cheeseburger, fries, and a beer for lunch. Then I launched offto the shelter, another 5. Had to keep moving to keep warm.The surprise of the day was snow. Just flurries, but that's how cold it is. Probably be 35ish again tonight - thank goodness for silk liner. Headed intotown tomorrow afternoon.Getting to know some of the thru hikers I've been leap-flogging since daleville.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533506,"A relatively short day into town. Mostly downhill with no food in pack (light) made for quick hike. I blasted through the Shenandoah Nat Park quicker than I imagined. I feel tired but good. It is quite a workout day after day. One thing I know from marathon training is you have to rest and recover regularly. Well, walking all over a town completely designed for the car is not the way to rest and recover. But I did get a shower (#2) reapplied food and ate a huge burger and fries with pizza and ice cream for snack tonight while I do my load of laundry. I think I'll blast out of here tomorrow and book it for Harper's Ferry (4 days). Then find place to rest. Weatherman says it's going to rain the next few days. After yesterday snow flurries, I'm not sure what to expect. Today was a Blue Sky Day. We used to call the intangible value of a business (above asset value to reflect the ongoing extra value realized though reputation, contacts, customer base, experience, etc.) Blue Sky. In a high-quality business, the blue sky value is where the real money is. Anyway, today was big Blue Sky. Near perfect hiking weather: walking cold on the downhill and just below a sweat on the ups.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533655,"Boy does taking a zero feel like playing hooky. Especially when it rains most of the day. You feel like you are getting away with something. I think this is the first time I've paid for two straight nights lodging and just chilled. All previous zeroes (not many because frequently we don't take one on a section) have been with family or friends. It took me awhile to get my head wrapped around not pushing on, but once I did, it's been great. Time to eat some more, read the paper, do the crossword, go to the coffee shop, eat some salad, find the best milkshake in town (I'm 100% certain I'm not lactose intolerant), soak in Epsom salts, eat some more, email and pay bills, and eat some more. I must have had 20 strips of bacon (they were thin) this morning.When you're hiking, you're pretty much always monitoring everything: the temperature, your water supply, drinking enough, eating continuously, your physical response to hiking, the terrain, your breathing, the weather, distance to next stop, occasionally checking cell signal, etc. That's not to mention normal mental processes like memory, planning, music, wonderment, etc. On a zero, none of that is there once you've got your resupply, laundry, and shower. It's a chance to let go of the tension (it's not a bad tension) of hiking and just veg out. I have performed my vegging very well. Tomorrow I get a 10:30 am shuttle back to the trail and book it. Ill be in Harper's Ferry by Saturday am for my mail and then on to Pennsylvania. My next zero will be with cousin Cynthia and Bill. Uncle Jim will be there, too. I am truly blessed to be here.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535151,"Got a ride out of town @10:30 after a big breakfast. The rain was petering out just then so the timing was great. It was chilly and threatening all day which is good hiking weather. The tread was about one third smooth, one third rocky, and one third muddy. Ups and downs were modest and the lower elevation forest was further into spring. Actually fewer wildflowers and more leafed out trees. So it should have be an easy fifteen day. Except my feet were screaming. My left big toe was in full arthritic trauma and my right foot was just wrong across the top. I gutted my way through it, thinking it would work itself out. Finally at about mile fourteen I think I figured it out: I had purchased and placed in each shoe a cheap cushion insert. No structure, just a thin cushion. I couldn't believe that would cause so much pain but that's the only thing that's different. So I pulled them out and walked into camp with considerably less pain. The true test will be tomorrow. Hopefully I'll be back on track without the pain. I feel pretty dumb for walking so long in pain without doing something about it. Lesson learned. It doesn't take much to ruin your hike so I'll be more careful. There's at least 10 people in the vicinity of the shelter, many of them thru hikers.So it goes: I see noone all day and the shelter is full. I saw a few people I was leapfrogging in the Shenandoah Park. Everyone is friendly but pretty much into their nightly routine. From here on I think the hike is different. No more big mountains. Less wilderness. More roads, airplanes, lawn mower noises, less old growth forests. I think it'll be more about navigating to the next resupply or the next zero. More just filling the groove. But if my feet hold up, I'm psyched for the next section. I plan on doing 15/day for the next week until I get to cousin Cynthia and Bill's.","Front Royal

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535152,"Hallelujah. My feet hurt normally today. I was worried yesterday but taking those cushion insoles out of the shoes seemed to work. Which is not to say my feet didn't hurt. They did but in a normal way. Today's word could probably be Rocks. It started out as mud. But then we hit the section of trail near the northern end of Virginia they call 'the roller coaster'. It's only 13 miles but it gets its name from the continuous sequence of 300-600 ft ups and downs. The profile is not that tough, comparatively. It's the fact that almost all of those hills are piles of Rocks. So you are navigating Rocks for what seems like forever. I'm almost through the roller coaster and I still haven't taken any vitamin I (ibuprofen). That's a good sign. Most of the thru hikers seem in pretty good spirits. We passed the 1000 milemarker today, a real psychological lift. We're also on our last full day in Virginia as we pass into West Virginia tomorrow. Everyone will be going through Harper's Ferry tomorrow and Saturday. Everyone (myself included) will stop at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters for their traditional 'halfway' picture on the front porch of their building. For me, I reached the 2/3 point in my AT hike today. I have about 730 miles left. It seems doable as long as I hold up, feet and all. Also today: No Rain. And it's considerably warmer tonight. I saw my first mosquito this evening.I think we're going to get one more minor cold snap but the season is finally changing. I feel lucky to have had the cold and rain I have.

Seems like a lift to finish each state (there are 14) so this'll be a good week. Finish West Virginia tomorrow and Maryland Tuesday. Pennsylvania will take awhile. Trail miles seemed hard to come by today. I guess the roller coaster and the rocks just slow things down. It takes patience to navigate rocks, especially when they go on and on. And they did go on and on. It was a day of extremes, though as the trail was a runway when it wasn't rocks. After the roller coaster section, I hiked the devils backbone. It was a long (miles) narrow ridge with the top of it a pile of boulders. Thankfully the trail gods ran the path down below on a shoulder of the ridge where it was more manageable most of the time. So it was a day of flying down the smooth parts and grinding to a crawl on the rocky parts. There's a storm predicted at 2am with rain until midday tomorrow so most folks are booking it for Harper's Ferry to get a hostel. I pulled up 3 miles short and camped. I'm not into the town/hostel things unless it's time for a rest or the weather's really bad. I have mixed feelings about the technology-based hiking thing. It's nice to know what the weather's going to do but it makes it less of a wilderness experience to game the weather. Seems a bit soft.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535157,"Rocks, rain, and mud. They say to stay out of Vermont until after memorial day (they call it vermud) because it's a pain and it tears up the trail. This year, this may, I'm calling it Marymud here. When not navigating rocks, it was a mud slosh. It might sound like I'm complaining, but I'm not. The mud, the rain, and the rocks gave me a chance to prove out my gear changes and it was a fantastic success. First, a big shout out to my mom. I've decided she should have a trail name since she's such an amazing trail Angel. If she'll accept it, I'm going to call her XC. Remember your Roman numerals if you want the clue. Anyway, XC, aka Mom got my old hiking boots (Vasque ankle high gtx) sent to me in Harper's Ferry on really short notice. I was quite apprehensive about switching shoes at this point but my feet just were getting beat up by the rocks. Today was a very different story for the old feet and I'm thrilled. On top of that, my new rain kilt (I retired the garbage bag) arrived from ULA, the same folks that made my pack. Made out of sil-nylon, it has Velcro fasteners and an elastic waist. Best part: it's deep royal purple. I'm definitely stylin now (with dry shorts underneath. So hiking was great. I went to the ATC headquarters this morning and had my picture taken. I forget my number but they number section hikers separately from this year's thrus so the # doesn't mean much. Then I resupplied and ate: twice. I waddled out of town in the rain (oh yeah, it rained from 2 am all day with just a brief hiatus mid-morning). It was sort of cold as we were in a mist/cloud much of the afternoon.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535159,"Well, they said there'd be days like this. It rained all night and it was raining when I got up and it rained all day. So I broke camp, hiked, and set up camp in the rain. To top it all off, somehow I bought the one mountain house meal (beef stew) which I can hardly handle. I had a bad experience in Maine (it had rained all day that day) with their beef stew and swore I'd never buy it again. Perfect. Oh well, I added some sunflower seeds to it (helped the texture) and added some olive oil (helped the consistency) and I got it down. I'm in my tent at a stealth site and it's raining. As soon as I get a break (if), I'll go out and hang my bear bag. I saw zero AT hikers on the trail today. I guess they're hunkered down or I'm between groups. I saw a few weekend hikers and most of them didn't seem very happy. A very pleasant couple at the Washington monument (the original one in Maryland) gave me an apple and took my old shoes to take to the trash. So I'm hiking in my boots, like it or not. They really handle the rocks better but they create the typical round of taped toes and weird ankle and forefoot pains. I guess we all choose our poisons. I'm glad to have the boots. There were six young local fellows hiking the four state challenge today. They started at five this morning on the Virginia side of the va/wv line. Soon they should cross into Pennsylvania having traversed West Virginia and Maryland. Hence the four states. It was a muddy (did I mention the rain) 43 miles. I saw them at the halfway mark at lunch so I hope they made it.Marymud has been a bit rough so far (I finish it tomorrow) but the people seem really nice. There's oodles of history everywhere. Some of the walking today was along old woods roads; all of it was either muddy or rocks. I'm on a march to pine grove furnace state park for a pickup Thursday by my cousin for a zero in Lancaster, PA. Ill be ready. I've been told the weather is going to break and it'll be 'real nice'. That'll be 'real nice'.","Crampton Gap Shelter

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535162,"A long and adventurous day. I slept in a bit to wait for the sun to come up to dry some things. I wound up not leaving the campsite til 10:30, three hours later than usual. But I got most things reasonably dry. Considering I arrived in a downpour after two days and a previous night in the rain, I was in good shape by 10:30 today. So I set out. At some point, I finally just accepted there are going to be a lot of rocks. The mud will eventually dry, but the rocks are here to stay. I'm not sure of the geologic reason or if it's an ice age, glacial terminal morraine thing, but there's just lots of rocks. But the weather was nice, not too sunny but nice.I walked through a few grassy fields and went up and down various rock fields. Then, to my surprise, we had a bona fide climb. It was 'only' 800' or so but it was a good climb that felt like Tennessee or Vermont. The hike across the top was also more like other states. But the descent, wow, it was rock hopping, hard to find the 'trail', 'i can't believe they expect me to traverse that' kind of stuff for 600'. It was pretty radical (and fun). Then came the thunder. Against any notion I had about the weather for the day, the skies opened and drenched me for 1 1/2 hours. Crazy wind and blowing rain. Then, just as I arrived at the Maryland/Pennsylvania border (the Mason Dixon line), the rain stopped. Lucky for me, because I needed to go into town at the next road crossing.I took off my kilt and started hitching. First car took me to Wal-Mart.Resupply and subway done, I headed back toward the trail. First car to come by brought me back. Good thing because it was 7:30 and starting to get dark in the woods. I booked it for the first campsite (1/2 mile) and found a spot not taken by the outward bound group or a couple of thru's. Of course, just for good measure, it rained for the ten minutes it took me to set up. No big deal; just par for the day. Another good one on the AT.","Stealth campsite

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535164,"Pennsylvania is nice so far. Lots of shelters, picnic areas, and campsites. You can see where they have atv trails through the woods, too. The trail is generally nice, with some real ups and downs, but not brutally tough rock fields (yet). The first five miles this morning I heard loud gunshots sporadically for what seemed like a long time. My first thought was that they must not be a very good shot. But it kept up for a long time. I guess they like to shot guns up here. The big issue for the day was my boots. Or I should say my toes. Both little toes are apparently squished into these boots to the point of anguish. I had to stop midmorning and pop another blister and tape up. By lunch I couldn't take it anymore. I followed Charlie's lead; I got out my knife and cut a slit through the leather on each shoe to give my little ones some space. It helped a lot but now ill have to figure out a way out of this mess. Ill either get my treksta's shipped from Florida or go shoe shopping on my zero. What a rookie mistake. But I still am making my miles; 109 in the last seven days. That's a lot with normal feet. So, I think it'll work out. So you know the feeling of unease when you can't find your keys? More to the point, you know the sense of relief you feel when you find them? I realized that's the cycle I go through whenever I've got to survive some challenge out here, say setting up camp in the rain and getting dry and warm before losing your body temperature. Or any number of other examples. A situation is happening, I know it can be solved but I have to be smart and be very deliberate in completing the steps necessary to resolve, and then it feels really good and satisfying to succeed. It happens all the time. I also realized that, from above, my hiking movements in the rocks probably most resemble an ant. You know how they never go straight for more than a step or so and they seem to be shifting left and right almost randomly. If they're anything like me as a hiker, they are in a zone of continuously choosing the next few steps based on the complexity of the path immediately ahead. I always admired ants, now even more.","Falls Creek campsite

The theme for this morning was webs. That is, spider webs. The first guy out (me) gets to clear the cobwebs from the trail. I have adapted a technique where I wave my pole in front of me like a cowcatcher on a train to break up as many of the web's as possible. My special hat, with it's wide brim, catches quite a few. But I still wind up with the occasional face full. Not really full, but you know how it feels. It makes you really glad to see the first Sobo (southbounder), especially if they're tall. Got out by 7:15 and did most of my hiking while it was cool. There was a breeze most of the day and I only had one big up. I pulled into this shelter to find a campsite since cousin Bill is picking me up @ 3:30 tomorrow only 9 miles from here. So ill hike it in the morning cool. I may take the half gallon ice cream challenge while I'm waiting. It's another trail tradition to celebrate the halfway point on the trail (which I will pass tomorrow morning).Okay, so far Pennsylvania wins the prize for number and quality of shelters. There are double shelters almost once every five miles. And they're nice, although I still don't sleep in them. As for my feet, let's just say I'll be glad to walk the last 10 miles in these boots tomorrow. They're better with the leather sliced up, but they still hurt. I'm learning to tune it out and I don't think I've done any damage which won't heal. Tough lesson. Easy walking today.

My cousin (by marriage) Bill picked me up @3:30 to take me to the incredible hospitality of cousin Cynthia and Bill. It was an easy 9.5 here from shelter (I arrived by 10:30) and my toes didnt fall off on this last day in my boots. I'll be looking for a mountain to throw these boots off (ala Wild) now as I'm not keen on sliding my feet into their grasp again. After a brief visit to AT museum (highly recommended) I went back to the store/restaurant where they offer the 'half gallon challenge'. At the end table on the patio, five of us all successfully completed the challenge. For the privilege, we got to pay this establishment $8 each and we each received a little kiddie wooden spoon with the words 'member of half gal. club' stamped on them. What a Tom Sawyer picket fence deal but it was fun. Then, after a brief respite, I had a cheeseburger and fries. Much gear talk ensued and eventually we each went our own direction, some north, some to the campground and lake, some to the hostel. I waited for Bill back at the museum. After a very engaging 1 1/2 hour ride to Lancaster, PA, we arrived to a Shower followed by a meal-size salad followed by a full plate of rice, roast, and broccoli.

I've been trying to find one since frontroyal, va. They sell these massive canisters now that weigh 18 oz. And definitely don't fit in my pack system. That's all I could find anywhere. I survived for quite awhile on a cannister I found in the hiker box back in front royal. Trying to resupply on foot is a real challenge, especially looking for a have to have item like fuel. I survived since Waynesboro, PA, using a sterno can I found in that Wal-Mart. It didn't work very well but I 'cooked' 5-6 meals with it. Took a long time but you make it up as you go. Today's overwhelming theme is my feet. With the new shoes (new pair of tried and true treksta hiking shoes), I am definitely back in the pink. My feet hurt a bit but no new blisters and nothing screamed at me. To my poor little toes, which are recovering nicely,I say, with the deepest conviction, I am sorry and I won't pull another bone-headed move like that again.I skipped ahead about 12 miles from pine grove furnace because Charlie (willI?), Bill, and I hiked it in the fall of 2013. That felt kinda cool. The hike was pleasant. There were rocks, some loose and some large, but they were very manageable. There were two sections referred to as 'rock maze' in the guide. These were sections on the top of the ridge with bus size boulders through which you navigated around, over, and through following carefully placed arrows and blazes. It was very fun and nothing like mahousic notch in Maine(which was fun but scary). As I approached boiling springs PA, there was a cornfield walk of over a mile. Normally not a big deal but it's over 90 degrees today and humid. Lots of locals were out for a hike and they were seriously wilting. It didn't bother me much because I'm sort of used to it and I have my hat to shade me. It makes a big difference. We're hiking through the Carlisle Valley, a 17 mile stretch of flat lowlands where no camping is allowed. So I got a room on the far side of boiling springs and am waiting out the heat. Tomorrow I'll finish the valleywalk and then the rocks really begin the next day. Boiling springs seems like a cool little town (1st AT designated trail town) and it hosts the regional ATC office).So, finally, a big shout out to my cousins Cynthia and Bill.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536556,"Today was an easy walk through Cumberland valley, mostly along the margins of farm fields. Midway, it became a stroll along a couple of creeks, with footbridges and plank walkways. There were several stiles to climb, and plenty of thrashing through tall grass. The trail passed over 2 interstates and several roads, crossed a bridge and went through a tunnel. Finally, near the end of a short day, I climbed a comfortable 800' ascent to my campsite at a shelter. I started early (6:45) and was here by 1:45. But stop I did. The way PA lays out for the next several miles with water availability, severe rocks, and shelters,there's not a good next place to stop for maybe 10 miles. Plus I'm committed to giving my feet a break and not pushing it. So, against my normal tendency, I stopped. I feel very good about that and hope it will help me make it all the way. If I don't get to Dalton, MA by July 1, I'll just come back to finish after Charlie and I get finished with Maine. That's my commitment to myself. How the ATC (Appalachian Trail Conservancy) sets it's agricultural policy is of great interest to me. I need to learn more about the nature of age lands owned, but it seems like they are content to have the farm fields continue in use as large-scale agriculture with genetically modified seed stock and full range of chemical application. Their fields are indistinguishable from the surrounding farms except for a footpath traversing the fields. There's corn, spring wheat ?, and hay fields. Just like in Virginia near catawba, I'm very intrigued by the notion that the ATC could go a very different direction with their ag lands use policy and, working with nrcs (fed ag conservation agency) again local, progressively minded farmers, explore some organic and more sustainable options. I think it could become integrated with the trail and hikers through farm work centers with a hostel/work for stay element. When I get done, I think I'll approach the ATC about this and it seems like the boiling springs office is the most likely interested region. As the summer weather and daylight timing continue, I am feeling good about waking up around 5:15, cooking breakfast and packing, and getting miles in early. I may add an afternoon fiesta followed by more miles as my mile budget increases. That will largely depend on the terrain and my physical readiness for more miles. There has definitely been a transition in the weather and I'm adjusting my hike to stay healthy and happy. I'm thrilled to be here.","Boiling Springs

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536557,"A relatively pleasant day. First 11 were very comfortable walking. The guidebooks said ""trail very rocky"" for 6 miles across the top of a ridge. I've been anxious about that stretch for days. Well, it turned out to be tamer than much of what I've walked already this year. Not sure what they were thinking. Finished the rocky section in the town of Duncannon where another trail icon is located: the Doyle Hotel. It's been a trail institution for years. The word on it now is the burgers and beer are good but the rooms are a dump. So I had a burger and beer, did a little resupply across the street, and moved on. The thing is, moving on in duncannon means road and bridge walking for 2.3 miles. It's a very depressed community and it was hot and noisy with major roads and trains. That was followed by a pretty tough uphill and a mile + of very difficult rock hopping atop the next ridge. By the time I got to the next camping spot, I called it a day. It rained pretty much all last night but not today (so far). It feels like it might do the same tonight. Cool breeze right now. I fell for the first time this year towards the end of my hike today. No injury and it was in a pretty hairy spot but I fell well. I had just changed my hand grips on my poles to the ski style which I started doing on tough rocks in New Hampshire. Good thing I did, it avoids you getting twisted up with your trekking poles. It happens really quickly. Today is dad's day; miss him all the time. But I always smile when I think of him. Happy birthday, dad. Pacing myself across PA.PostScript: It did, in fact, begin to rain. A pretty good thunderstorm. I wound up cooking/eating in my tent (again).

First water was @ 13 miles so I pressed to get there by lunch. The trail was pretty friendly;ridge walking with some rocky top sections, but pretty fast tread. I walked carefully to minimize foot bruising and it seemed good. After lunch, I kept moving at pace and headed for a 20. It felt good. The highlight of the day was a grouse attack. I was walking along, minding my own business, when off to my right, maybe 15 feet ahead, all hell broke loose. It was like when you flush a quail or a pheasant except the bird didn't fly away. It came screaming out onto the trail, directly in front of me, in full tail display. At first, I was startled and thought it was a turkey. But it was too small and didn't have a turkey neck or face. It looked like a medium-size chicken with tail feathers. And it was hissing and squawking and flapping and showing all it's armor. It rushed me and for a second I thought I was going to have to whack it with my pole. He sized me up and I sized him up face-to-face and I guess he figured out he may be in a little deep. He sidled back into the woods, raising Cain the whole time. Then, in one last move of aggression (or fake injured bird routine for distraction), he came back out onto the trail and scuttled off to the left. Wow, was that cool. On a much mellower level, this morning was hiking in the mist of a cloud in a primitive feeling forest. All morning, little paper moths would fly out, seemingly brand new and emerging in flurries of 5-10 at once. They reminded me of fairies in the morning, a kind of story book feeling. The trail maintenance crew on this section gets the Paul Bunyan award. They cleared at least a dozen blowover trees 10"" to 2' in diameter, with an axe. That's a lot of axe work; no chain saws for these guys. Another fun day on the trail.","Clarks Ferry Shelter

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536559,"Today was another early, fast morning. I did 10 by 10, including a pleasant wash up by a cool stream. At about 11am, I reached a road that was 2.3 miles from I-81 intersection where I planned to do a mini-resupply so I hitchhiked in. That went pretty well. I went to three fast food places and a truck stop, purchasing a cheeseburger and fries and checking email, buying lousy 2-day resupply (truck stop?), getting a subway for dinner, and enjoying a milkshake. Then, hitch back to the trail. The second hitch was much hotter and longer, but I got there. Then, Pennsylvania began to unveil a preview of Rocks to come. After finishing the ridge I was on the last couple of days, I descended to the above-mentioned stream. Then I climbed up and over Second Mountain which was a bit of a challenge rockwise. But then I climbed a tough climb onto the ridge I'll be walking the next several days. Wake up, here we are. I walked many rock fields which were pretty difficult. Usually in rocky stretches you slow way down and choose each step so you don't fall orland awkwardly. There were many spots today where I slowed to a crawl,looked for my next foot placement, and there just wasn't any. Or a seemingly good rock to hop would shift when you step on it kinda jostling the entire rhythm of the walk. And gazillion small, loose rocks (scree??) create a pretty unstable path. For long stretches. I actually did pretty well with the rocks. It's a matter of patience and slowing down. I did seemingly somehow strain my left lower shin today, though. It started hurting at about mile 15 or 16. Maybe I need to back off a bit. Ill work on that. Not a whole lot of thru-hikers in my midst but I have spent quite a bit of time talking and walking with a mother/daughter team,and two different young women hiking solo on two different days. So I've been getting plenty of social time. I feel like my hike is progressing well; I'm nearing my personal halfway point for this year.

My shin felt pretty good at first today but by lunch it hurt pretty badly. So I soaked it in a cold spring run, put some tape on it, took two ibuprofen, and kept walking. After several delays, I finally pulled into the shelter area at 6:15, much later than is my preference, having walked 19 miles. The way towns, water supply, and shelters line up, somehow it made sense. But I do need to rest my leg so tomorrow I plan on 10 miles and then find a place to stay and rest until at least the next afternoon. Not sure two short days will help, but it's better than two long days. I'm not worried it'll be a serious issue, but I need to pay attention to it.Meanwhile, it was a beautiful day. Not too hot with a breeze. Much of the terrain was relatively friendly; much of it not so. I will try not to complain too much about the rocks but they have some wicked rocks here, and I'm told they keep getting worse. Stopped at a shelter this morning with a shower (2 large barrels filled with water elevated over an enclosure) so I took one. Soaked feet at lunch, had a conference call with the lawyers on a cohousing matter from in the woods, talked to a trail magic guy, and walked a lot. Some stretches today were overgrown with laurel, wild rose, and poison ivy. Others were wonderful, sparsely wooded forests with solid ferns for understory. Another kind of magic fairyland.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536561,"Ok, it's official now, I am injured. Still not sure what's going on; I just know my left shin is increasingly painful and swollen. Walking is a real chore so I feel good about having made it to town (Port Clinton). When you do long-distance running, you learn the difference between little pains, which will work themselves out, and injuries.Usually the remedy is rest and ice. I think that's the case this time. The question is always, how long? I could be surprised, but I think this one needs several days. So, those of you who know me know what that means: I'm in planning mode. The only challenge is I couldn't get the WiFi to work at the tavern where I had a late lunch ( yes, hiker cheeseburger with French fries and yeungling beer ( we're about 15 miles from the yeungling brewery)). So, at this point I'm tented in a free camping park/pavilion here in town. Tomorrow I'll figure out next steps, but it probably won't be on the AT. At a minimum, tomorrow will be a zero day. It took me awhile, but I'm quite sanguine about the possibility of taking some rest. I know it's a thousand times better than continuing to try to push through this thing, only to wind up with a stress fracture or something while having a terrible time hiking in pain. I'm confident I will heal quickly. The irony is my feet are feeling great, in spite of some pretty rough rocks. So let's talk about rocks. There are many sizes, shapes, and types of rocks. PA seems to specialize in relatively small and medium, sharp rocks. Up in Maine, they have huge rocks and boulders. They have sheets of granite, slippery as can be. But not here.There are boulder fields, which go on for a quarter mile or so, which is a pile of mixed-sizes of rocks across which you navigate rock by rock, often hopping from the top of one to the next. It can be fun; it is exhilarating; but it is also where the most falls seem to happen (I fell again today - no damage done).Next, in PA they have rock fields. Here, very few large boulders exist. It is simply a continuous pile of rocks sized from finger-size to suitcase-size. Most every rock is pitched at a severe angle, almost all with sharp edges and pointy corners. There seem to be very few rounded corners on PA rocks. Rock fields may be the worst for walking. Every step is perilous and any rock which appears to be near horizontal is not to be trusted. I have yet to figure out the intelligent design at work here, but there seems to be a strong prejudice against flat, horizontal surfaces. So, you embrace what you're given; you learn to walk on pointy rocks. Where your foot lands on a pointy rock determines the difference between success and anguish. If you land on the heel, your foot is typically thrown into a rather violent twist which proves the worth of strong ankles. If you land on the forefront, control is good but it doesn't take very many forefoot landings to start feeling quite bruised. A side-foot landing (inside or out) frequently leads to getting your foot wedged between the target rock and it's neighbor, often leading to a painful sudden squeezing of a tender part of your foot between two rock-hard surfaces (rocks). So the goal is to land squarely on the hard-plastic mid-foot sole of the shoe. This provides the best chance for successfully navigating to the next rock. Next are trails full of random rocks, often pitch at precarious angles and obscured from view by leaves or dirt. This is pretty good walking but you must maintain vigilance to avoid a sudden, painful surprise. Hiking poles help a lot here as a quick jab into the ground can avoid shifting weight onto the ill-placed foot before damage is done. There are all variants you can imagine to the above types of features in PA but the common factor is sharp-edged rocks. Oh yeah, sometimes these features are at a severe incline or decline, adding complexity.So, PA is a wonderful place, I suppose, but, if I were to be critical of the trail experience here, these are the things I'd talk about. Noise: it seems we are seldom out of earshot of a highway, train, airplane, or small motor.Road crossings: goes with road noise. Some days you cross five or six roads (many of them heavily travelled).Poison ivy: it's everywhere. Rattlesnakes: lots (at least they rattle to warn you) Gunshots: I'm not sure what the deal is; I don't think it's even hunting season but I hear them every day. Trail maintenance: maybe I'd gotten spoiled, but there are sections where ankle high weeds and head high shrubs and trees are constant. Obviously they don't have the 4X8 sheet of plywood clearance standard here. Farmfield walks: avoid heat of the day. Truckstops advertised as resupply options: c'mon. Rocks: there are a few. But I'm not going to be critical of the trail here because it's a gift and I'm grateful to be here.","Eagles Nest Shelter Camp

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539019,"The good news is I'm back on the trail. The less than good news is the trail here is pretty rugged and I'm worn out. After 10 days of laying around as much as possible and drinking milkshakes every day, it was a whirlwind return to the trail. I got the ok about 2 pm yesterday and I was on the road by 3. 500 miles later, at 1:30 this morning,I stopped in an el cheapo hotel for some sleep. At 7, I headed for Delaware Water Gap, the Pennsylvania/New Jersey border. I had breakfast there and started to look for a place to park sister trail Angel Carol's car. I was coming up empty so I walked up to two guys painting the yellow curbs in town. I asked about parking and the guy said I could park at his house up the street. He said he was the mayor of the town and he'd look over it. How cool is that? The mayor paints the curbs in that town and he's a really nice guy: Mayor Bob. The hike today started with a mile sidewalk/bridge walk over the Deleware River. Very loud and always tiring. Then the fun began. So far, New Jersey is really quite beautiful. The weather was exquisite. There was a gentle, park like climb up to the top of the ridge. But then there was almost continuous rocks for the rest of the day. Not the worst rocks ever (close) but the thing that wore me out was there was no break. Virtually every step was trying to land successfully on a rock or avoid a rock. There was a rock involved in every step. Really slows me down and gets mentally taxing after awhile. So, tomorrow I hope to be a bit more tolerant of the rocks and try to enjoy the trail. It seems quieter here than Pennsylvania so far and more wild. I think I have another 2 days along the top of this ridge system. But today I'm grateful for all the help I got over the last ten days, especially from sister trail Angel Carol. She really stepped up. Many others have helped me with encouragement and concern. Thanks. I just have to remind myself that, for the first day back on the trail, things are good. My legs and joints feel good (ish) and my stomach and metabolism will catch up in a day or so. Onward toward New York.","Delaware Water Gap

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539020,"A much better day today. The terrain wasn't that much different, but my attitude and rhythm were much improved. I realize there is an attitude which comes from hiking everyday that is very different than off the trail. You only have one thing to do and, no matter how you approach it, it's going to take all day and the trail is what it is. If you allow it, a certain kind of calm happens. My calm was disrupted by my injury and all the anxiety of figuring it out, including being off the trail for ten days. And I was tired and not acclimated to trail conditions (food, water, sleep, temperature, effort, etc).So today I just tried to remain calm. The rocks did seem a bit friendlier and there was more diversity in the trail. There were sections along old ridge roads which were gravel (easy). There were several ridgetops which were slabs of rock (granite) slanting along the hillside which the trail followed. It reminded me of Maine on a smaller scale (without the roots). There seemed to be more space between the rocks and more sections where walking wasn't constant rocks. This morning there were entire hillsides covered in grasses in full seed. It looked like baby's breath in an ornamental flower vase for acres. Later there were sections of laurel in full bloom. This afternoon I saw a bear scampering away through the woods. They really are beautiful creatures. So, it is truly good to be back on the trail. I imagine tomorrow will be even better. I just hope my shin finally heals and I'll feel normal again. Two more days of antibiotics. We'll see.","Rattlesnake Spring Campsite

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539021,"New Jersey is really neat. Today's hike was small ups and downs from rock ridge to ridge. I finished in high point state park from which I'm told you can see the skyline of NYC. I wouldn't know because it rained virtually the whole day. Made rock hopping a bit precarious but I just slowed down. The big issue for me today is my leg. I don't want this journal to be a recitation of woes, but I also want to highlight what's going on so here it is. My shin still hurts pretty badly and the infection just doesn't seem to be going away. It gets progressively worse as the day goes on and the swelling increases around it. Today felt like Thursday two weeks ago. Tomorrow morning is my last antibiotic so I'm pretty convinced it didn't work on this infection. So what's next? I cannot continue with this degree of pain. The doc said if it didn't improve to call her and she'd prescribe a different antibiotic. I'll be close to a pharmacy in a couple of days so that's a likely scenario. Meanwhile I'll try to go easy and take more ibuprofen. It's a drag to hike in pain. In spite of that, I did enjoy the scenery and terrain today. Hopefully I'll get this figured out and I can keep going. I'm seeing very few thru hikers. I've been leapfrogging one group of four but that's about it. There are maybe six local hikers each day. So it's mostly just me and the bears and birds. I did see a beautiful male turkey two days ago.","Glen Anderson Shelter

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539022,"Today was excellent. I was on the trail by 6:10, heading for Unionville, N.Y. The trail straddles the NJ/NY border for 20 miles or so. First, we descended high point mtn, the end of the wild part of NJ. Then there was a series of short climbs and descents across rolling hay fields and quite a bit of boardwalk through mostly dry swamps. The fragrances of the lower elevation were alluring. Wildflowers, hay, wet woods. And the weather was perfect. Then I went into Unionville. At the post office, I picked up my package from Leki (trekking pole company). Not only did I get a replacement lower shaft for one pole, I got both lower shafts, each with new tips. Score. I had an excellent sandwich at the General store, resupplied, and charged my kindle. I also ordered a 2nd antibiotic for my leg to be picked up Sunday. Then I walked the rest of a short day through more fields, a mile and a half along a levee through a natl wildlife refuge, along a long section of boardwalk, and up a steep climb.I'm operating under a plan to do short days until Monday, when I'll be going to stony point center for three days of rest and slack packing. If I use ibuprofen and take it easy (slow, 12-mile days), the pain is tolerable. By next week I hope to have my leg back and I can crank up the miles again. I have a contingency plan, but I hope I don't need to trigger it. I felt another shift in attitude today. I am more focused on things other than walking. Probably because the terrain was so much easier and diverse, it is a good feeling to not feel like I'm completely absorbed in rock hopping or pain management. So I'll enjoy the slower pace for a week or so.","High Point Shelter

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539025,"What a great day, full of surprises. Last night not a single hiker even passed the shelter where I camped, let alone stayed there. An unusual occurrence, probably because there were hostels a little behind and a little ahead. No matter to me. Up early, I walked across and then down pochuck mountain and then ambled up and down some moderately strenuous undulations. After crossing the first of three really nice creeks today, there were several sections of boardwalk. Then, after some farm fields, I came to what must be the most photographed boardwalk on the trail. This about two mile boardwalk/bridge system was built by the N.Y./N.J. AT group to eliminate a long road walk section through Vernon. It took 14 years to complete (7 to permit, 7 to build) and included a really cool suspension bridge. I met the guy maintaining this section and we had a good talk. Then @ a road crossing I saw a note for a freshfood market nearby. Perfect timing as I was already finished my morning snack and I was hungry. So I had watermelon, coffee, and a wrap, followed by a milkshake and an apple. Maybe that's why the last couple of days have been so enjoyable, that is, because I found places for good food for early lunch/ second breakfast. Anyway, it was a good thing I fueled up because next came 'the stairway to heaven', a challenging approx. 1000' climb that include lots of rock steps (I didn't count them but it was vigorous). There were lots of town folks out for the challenge of climbing this imposing looking rock face and that was good to see. About halfway back down the backside of the mountain, I passed three college-age girls and they asked if I knew if we were to the overlook yet. I directed them back up the mountain to where there had been a sign which said View on it. Seemed like the fact we'd been going downhill for quite awhile would have been a clue but they were having fun. One girl asked where this trail went if they kept going. I told her: Maine. Later I came to another beautiful stream where I washed and cooled off. Several climbs and descents today were challenging but fun. Now I'm camping at the last shelter in NJ. Just like I wasn't going to complain about states (if I was it'd be PA), I won't pick favorites. But if I did, NJ would be on the short list. It is a really cool state to hike, with lots of diverse trail types, some surprisingly rugged, lots of wildlife, and lots of good amenities near road crossings. It also is surprisingly wild, given how close we are to millions of people. Part of it may be there aren't any major highways in earshot. Anyway, I do like the trail in NJ. I'm sticking to my 12 mile/day healing plan and the leg pain is bearable.In AWOL's guidebook, it says of tomorrow: Despite its unimposing profile, rocks and abrupt ups and downs make this section challenging. Oh boy.","Woodchuck Mtn Shelter

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539026,"What a great day. New Jersey finished with a bang and new York started with an even bigger bang. Per the warning in the guidebook, there was very little change in the profile but the rocks and abrupt ups and downs made for lots of challenges. But these were not rocks that test your patience. These were long, low slab rock ridges we were crossing perpendicular to the ridge. So up and down we went, each time a challenging, somewhat technical climb or descent. Never more than 50 or 100 feet, but always a challenge. Poles were abandoned in favor of balanced rock hopping and hand climbing. At one point there was a rebar ladder. On the tops, sometimes you'd traverse the top of the ridge (like being above treeline) for several hundred yards. It was great fun. And did I mention it was challenging?I hiked part of the way with a couple I met way back in the Shenandoahs and ran into another guy I hadn't seen since va. It is fun to see people again and catch up on things and compare experiences. I was out of camp before 6 and took a spur trail down into town at about 11. I had to go to town to pick up antibiotic #2. So of course I had to have a bacon cheeseburger and fries and coffee followed up with a pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream. I bought enough food to get me through tomorrow and headed out.So here was a classic hiker dilemma. Should I go backwards through town and back up the spur trail to where I got off or road walk north the 1.8 miles to complete the triangle to get back on the trail. Absolute purists (I know that's redundant) refuse to miss a white blaze and go backwards and up the spur trail, an extra 1.5-2 miles. Pragmatists reason that taking the road (yellow blazing) covers more miles than not having come into town at all (it is two sides of a triangle) and take the road. I chose the road this time. And it was no cakewalk. It had gotten hot by this time (I dilly dallied in town til 2),it was the same uphill, and the shoulder was narrow on a very busy road. I had to stop and cool off when I made it back into the woods. So you hike your own hike; I'm completely at peace with that decision today. So about the antibiotic; I really don't want to take anymore. I'm painfully aware of how much trouble they caused Dad and the side effects can be pretty debilitating. So I'm thrilled to say that, while my leg is still painful and swollen, it is improving. My intention is to wait and hope for continued improvement, in which case I'll pass altogether on the second round. Fingers crossed. I got kinda sentimental today thinking about Dad (it is father's day). I found great relief and joy when a flock of crows started squawking and I remembered how Dad used to love to caw like a crow and have a good laugh. He had such a simple joy in things like that, I laughed out loud there in the woods, sharing the moment with him. It was a good laugh. Today was a good day to be hiking the AT and I'm grateful to be here.","Waywayanda Shelter

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539027,"New York is tough so far. Fun, but tough. For a low mileage day with modest cumulative vertical, I was tired. Of course it was 90 degrees and humid. It was more progressing perpendicular to a series of low (50- 200 feet), rocky ridges. Sort of like an ant walking across a ruffles potato chip. Up and down and up and down. And many of the ups and downs were vertical. Lots of hand climbing and rock hopping. Some long slabs along sections of ridge. But all fun. I really like new York so far. There were 2-12 gallon jugs of water at just about every road crossing. Plus some Gatorade and fruit trail magic. Natural water sources are scarce and often outlets from ponds which seem kind of sketchy so the jugs are very welcome. I've been in a bit of a bubble the last several days and enjoyed lots of good camaraderie. But the best part of the day was getting picked up by the shuttle at the Stony Point center where i'll be most of this week. They have reasonable accommodation, good food,and offer slack-packing shuttles. So while friend betty is here from Florida, we will enjoy a different way to hike a section of the trail. My leg did well today and the swelling continues to improve so I'm staying on the go low go slow course to healing. As long as the trajectory is favorable, that's my plan. So another section done (90 miles this week) and the countdown continues. I'm at about 450 miles left and working on figuring the best way to get to the three separate sections I have left (here to Mass, skipped PA, and 2 weeks in Maine) .

Jaw dropping beauty in the forested meadows occupying the ridges coupled with the open slab rock bands on top. The sky was blue. The breeze was stiff. The Lemon Squeezer was fun. And I had my first wild blueberries of the year (one bush was just early). Harriman State Park is the first section of the AT laid out and some of the oldest rocks in the world. It is spectacular not for its vistas (although at one point I could see the NYC skyline 35 miles away) but for its sheer beauty. The grasses swaying in the wind amongst the baldrocks and the mature northern forest was photographic. The second half of the hike was a bit rougher but still very enjoyable. And my leg barely hurt. Things are looking up.I've decided to go back to PA this weekend and finish the 75 miles I skipped; every week I wait it gets hotter and drier.

It was different in that it was highly groomed, including lots of steps. Some of (the?) the best steps on the AT. Today I hiked bear mtn, the last mountain west of the Hudson River on the trail and the earliest blazed section of the trail. At the bottom of the mtn was the lowest point on the AT, where we walked through a zoo. I ran into two of the hikers I did the half gallon ice cream challenge back in pine grove furnace, pa. We had fun walking and talking for awhile this afternoon, making the miles go quickly. The hiker community really is nice to be part of, drifting into and out of familiar faces. I've enjoyed this respite this week: one zero and two slack pack days. This Stony Point Center is a cool place to base and it has worked out great for Betty's visit. It's been a welcome mid-hike break and I'm stoked to get back on the trail full-time. Tomorrow I head back to PA to bite the dog that bit me.

After two train cancellations, they sent a bus to transport all the train waiters to Hackensack to get back on track.

All the locals scramble off the bus and run onto the train destined for who knows where. Betty and I stayed with the bus and we wound up getting a chauffeured ride all the way to Hackensack in a full size bus. Just the two of us. She chatted up the driver and it was fine.

Having a gap to fill was weighing on my mind and this way I'll be able to return Carol's car and not have that dangling out there. Plus I just couldn't get comfortable with the idea of finishing the trail in PA. Got started at 11:30 today so I was uncertain how far I would go. My original target was a shelter at about 15 miles. The first 5-6 miles were pretty comfortable; only occasional rock fields and the one climb was well graded. I was feeling much more positive about PA. I'm not saying I particularly like it; I just have a better attitude. Part of that is feeling better physically and part of it is knowing it's only 75 miles. The weather should be reasonable this week and water sources seem like there's still enough to collect it. I think new york is already drier than here. After a late lunch, I climbed to The Pulpit, a popular vista. There were lots of people enjoying a weekend outing. Seems like they get out here and are surprised at how difficult it is but most of them make it to the top. It was a good, challenging climb. Then came over a mile of rock hopping. It was difficult and really slowed me down but I kept my cool (only 75 miles). Then the trail took a sharp left turn onto a woods road and followed it in a westward direction for 2-3 miles. It felt odd going 'backward' but the gravel road was a welcome break. There was one stream all day and it was really nice. I felt like I could make it to the shelter by 7 so I kept going. Unfortunately, I didn't realize the shelter was at a road crossing so I kept going. By the time I figured out I had passed it, I was 0.5 beyond. It was getting late, my water supply was low and I was approaching another climb. This is not a situation I like to put myself into. But I reasoned my way through and kept going. I didn't want to go backwards, especially because it had gotten rocky again. Sure enough, on the summit of the mountain 2 miles beyond the shelter I found an ok stealth spot to set up. I was set up and in my tent by 8 with a second lunch (so I didn't have to use water to cook). I should be ok tomorrow as there is a spring within 4 miles. Ill eat a dry breakfast too and ration out my remaining water. Kinda sketchy, but I'm within the safety margin so all is well.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540241,"Pennsylvania rocks. I just had to say that. Today started out with uncertainty. I was almost out of water and the next spring was labeled 'unreliable' as are most of the few springs in this area. Things started off at a slow pace as it was pretty rough going with lots of rocks. But the spring was good so I stopped and had breakfast and got restarted from my unusual night last night. I felt normal again and the rocks didn't bother me nearly as much. Yesterday was easy hard easy. Today was hard easy hard. After five miles or so, I was on old woods roads for the middle five. I stopped at a road crossing tavern and had a burger, fries and a beer. It was pricy but worth it. I watered up at their faucet(there's almost no water out here) and headed out. Then I hit the third third and it was rough. They seem to have a thing here where they call sections things like Pinnacle, Knifes Edge, Bear Rock, and Bake Oven Knob but they are all just enormous piles of giant rocks over which you have to rock hop. It's kinda fun but today reminded me that I am not fearless. Navigating car size boulders all topsy turvy piled up can be unnerving. Some sections reminded me of mahousac notch in Maine, which is said to be the gnarliest mile on the AT. It's tough when these features just appear and you don't know what to expect or how long you're going to have to deal with it. Anyway, I made it to the shelter. Originally I was going to go on for a few miles to make the next couple of days line up better but I was ready to stop. It turned out the first two springs down the hill were dry. I had to go over a half mile through overgrown brush to get to spring three. It was excellent, flowing water and that's just what you have to do for water in PA in the summer. It was sorta hot today but not brutally so. I think it's going to continue to not be oppressive my last three days in PA.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540243,"For a short day, it sure was hard. But enjoyable. Probably the best day in PA so far, mainly because it was diverse. Lately it's been green tunnel rocky roads with intermittent gnarly rock sections. Not today. The day started pretty much the same rocks and roads. But then I went down a bit and started having open meadows of ferns or bushes with woods in between. It wasn't too bad walking and I started to see some different plants. And then, score, I found ripe blueberries. What a treat that was. After about 6 miles, I came upon the only water for the day. It was near the Lehigh Gap so it was time to get ready for some challenge. I'd read about the climb out of the gap: 1000' in 0.9 miles up a steep pile of rocks, all exposed in the hot sun. I had a snickers bar and camelled a liter of water and went for it. It was hot. It was steep.It was mostly in the exposed sun. It was windy. And it was a pile of rocks. The first half or so was small rocks and mostly just a tough climb.The second half was all rock hopping over huge and small rocks. It was well marked, and there were several required hand lifts although no rebar and nothing too daunting. Knifes Edge yesterday was scarier. It was actually a pretty fun climb. But then we got to the top: the palmerton superfund site on former zinc mined land. There was a 4-mile diversion around the restoration area. About 2 miles was along an old road, easy walking but hot in the open sun. I stopped for lunch near the end of that when I found some shade. Then it was 2 miles of tough rocks. Since there are essentially no water sources, I decided to hike into town to get a few food supplies and some water. The forecast was for rain at 3 and I'd read about a place you could pitch your tent so I did. I got everything set up by 3 and ate my pint of ice cream in my tent as the rain began. It is a good, soaking rain and I hope things will be dry tomorrow. I'm not sure of the forecast. So I had a nice afternoon nap with the rain tapping on my tent. Tomorrow I hope to carry out a bunch of water so I can make 15 without going way off the trail for water. Then Wednesday I should finish PA. Ill probably stay in the hostel in Delaware Water Gap and get in the car early Thursday to head for Ohio. I can almost see the end of PA.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540244,"The highlight for today was a box turtle. While it was probably the second prettiest pattern I have seen on a box turtle (after the one cousin Bill rescued and transferred to his pond), the fact that it was the highlight of the day should give an indication of how unremarkable today was. It was 14 miles of tough, rocky flat between a short, tough up and a longish, easy down. It rained most of the night and then again about 4 am, so it was wet. I had a 0.8 road walk up the mountain to the pass and about 3/4 of the way up, I entered the clouds. I stayed in a cloud until 1:30 this afternoon. It probably was a good thing as there were no views and it moderated things so I could go long on little water. I made it 16+ miles on 3 liters. I don't recommend this but water is so scarce out here and you have to go down 1/2 mile of rocks to maybe find some, it prompted some unusual behavior. I monitored my urine for color (sorry if that's too graphic) and everything went well. The walking was miserable, bordering on boring. At least 90% of the steps I took today required me to have my head down to make sure I landed on a rock or found space in between rocks which wouldn't injure me. Then about every hundred yards or so, a tree limb (saturated with the rain) would catch me in my face, on my head or shoulder, or force me sideways if I was attentive enough to see it first (remember my head was down). It was mentally challenging and mainly required a degree of patience and presence which are unusual. So maybe the highlight of the day was finishing 15 AT miles without injury. I hitched a ride into town at wind gap because town is the best place to get water here and I really felt like a shower. I got a hotel room. Once again, I dodged significant rainstorms as this system lolled through from 6-8 tonight. I'm glad not to be out fighting the elements tonight. And tomorrow I arranged a taxi to get me back to the trail for what should be the last day in PA. I'm told it's a killer stretch so I'll put my patient hat on one more time and praise the rocks.

I was reminded this morning of a country song about how the woman at the end of the bar got prettier and prettier as the hour approached closing time. It was rocky, but somehow I found a rhythm with it and thought about lots of things other than rocks. The miles rolled by quickly and there actually were some sections of old woods road and one cool rock hopping section called wolf rocks. Maybe PA wasn't so bad after all or maybe I was just getting close to closing time. I walked for awhile with a British couple and chatting always helps the time fly. The hike finished with a 2-3 mile section of old road and a 1 1/2 mile descent down a comfortable bunch of switchbacks. Some sections were actually pretty. There were rhododendron blooming on the way down. I got sort of emotional as I entered town. It's always a sense of relief and accomplishment when you descend into town after a long section but this was the end of PA, which has been my nemesis emotionally for the last month plus. I was mostly happy to have maintained a positive attitude through the whole state. My lesson from the trail so far seems to be that I can overcome every adversity that comes my way; I just have to stay calm and positive and things work out. That felt good coming down the mountain. In the end, the rocks were more of a mental challenge than a physical one. I also felt good because I knew I was headed for a hot dog and a piece of fresh cherry pie for $2.95 in Delaware Water Gap.

No more returning to fill in a gap or returning borrowed cars or seeing doctors; I can just hike again. Plus I'm doing miles with brother Charlie again. We've done over 1200 miles together so it's good to be sharing the experience with him again. Typical to our past, we went long today. But not necessarily by design. We had the chance to stop at 12 miles but it felt too early and too short. So on we went, planning on another 3-4 miles. But water issues and lack of good tent sites led us to an 18. We were both pretty worn out as today was seemingly always going up or down; very little level. No long ups or downs; just a lot of short, sometimes rocky ones. I think that can be more tiring than a few big mountains. Anyway, it was a good day and the farther north (east) we go, the smoother the trail seems to get. We hiked for a few miles all the way around a lake today just up the mountain. It is weird to be hiking through the woods and hearing people playing on the beach, swimming and in boats just below. It's July 3 so we keep hearing small bursts of fireworks as the sun is going down. I dont think we're going to see a fireworks show this year. But we get to hike on the AT, a trade ill take anytime.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541319,"Double 18.1's for first two days with Charlie. We need to dial it down a bit. Tough hiking both days and unintentional 18's both days. Water and campsites just aren't laying out right yet. Tomorrow looks like a chance to get on a better pattern so we'll quit beating ourselves up. It was a pretty walk today, not stunning, just nice. It was up and down again but more parallel (to the contours) and less perpendicular than yesterday. The tread had quite a bit of dirt and leaf walking, something I haven't seen in quite awhile. Some fun, rounded rock slab ridge tops and lots of huge boulders and rock cliffs to walk in between and around. Walking with someone again is different; you're more considering their pace and goals and we seem to pay more attention to where we are. But it's a welcome change and I'm glad to be with Charlie (Will I?) again. We are talking about how to figure a way to finish together, which would involve another delay but would give me the chance to have time with my whole family in mid-July for a couple of weeks. Lots of logistics; we'll see how it shapes up. For now, I'm focussed on finishing and enjoying N.Y., C.T., and M.A. To all who have commented on my guest book, thanks loads. It gives me a big lift to receive your encouragement. If you have any questions, just ask. Keeping this journal has been fun and it's a way to feel connected to my friends and family and I think about what's going on during the day a bit differently as I anticipate what I might say each night. Tomorrow, I go under 300 miles to completion. I'm still living in the day to day but it's getting more and more fun to think of the finish line. I certainly will miss being out here.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541320,"Great day today after a difficult night. What a difference 24 hours makes. We're in a wonderful tent area next to the ten mile river. It is flat and you can hear rushing water and birdsong. Last night we were tired from too many miles, we were on a terrible slope, and then it rained almost all night. Today, we slept in til 7 while the rain petered out and then made it the three miles down the mountain and through the swamp (cool boardwalk), and past the only AT railroad stop. We walked the 0.4 to Tonys deli and had an omelette. We got a couple of food items (after an awesome bunch of free food from a hiker who had too much from a mail drop) to give us an extra day or two to resupply and started walking. The trail today was the easiest I can remember with mostly packed dirt trails with few roots or rocks. We had a couple of good 600'climbs and accompanying downs but it was short and smooth. We pulled into this cool campsite with time to get things dried out and I had a swim in the river (that counts as a laundry day). We walked through several hay fields and pastures with 3 or 4 stiles to navigate. A very pleasant walking day, in spite of the really high humidity and some heat. So far the bugs aren't too bad so we'll keep our fingers crossed. Saw lots of hikers on the trail today and there's about a dozen tents in this site. As usual, everyone is pleasant and in a good mood, especially as we finished N.Y. today and entered Connecticut. This is my last entire state with just pieces of Massachusetts and Maine left after this short state. Countdown: 293 miles to go.","Telephone Pioneer Shelter

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541321,"You know how after a front pushes through and you have crystal clear skies, low humidity, and fantastic weather? Apparently that's not a summer sequence in Connecticut. Summer arrived. High heat, high humidity, almost no breeze or air movement, challenging climbs, wicked descents, and a long day made this a particularly difficult day. I think we managed it well (6 liters water each) and we got a ride into town (Kent) for a resupply and a ride back to the trail in the midst of it all. Connecticut definitely is not a lightweight state. The trail climbs and falls over a series of mountains which rise from the river running along the western edge of the state. The first climb was like Vermont; well graded. The first descent, all of a sudden we were climbing down a rock field. The next climb was steep and long. The last descent was like being in N. H. or Maine, an almost vertical climb down a cliff. It was kinda fun. In between were lots of short climbs and descents. So all in all a hard day (but aren't they all) ?As great as last night's campsite was, tonight's is equally bad. We hoofed it late to reach another tent site, imagining it would be like last night. What we found was a long climb to three, uneven tiny pads. I snagged the only decent spot and Charlie found one down next to the trail. There is a brook here with water so we'll make it work. Tomorrow's supposed to be hot again so we're going to try to take it easy; we are in no hurry. Countdown: 276.8 miles left.","Ten Mile River Tent Site

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541322,"So if you were at home watching your tv in your air conditioned room and the weather was like it was here this morning, warnings would be issued to avoid strenuous activities. Another hot and humid morning. We wisely decided to go low today; we are not in a hurry, we are not 20 years old, and Connecticut is steep. There's no good reason to push it and I think the first few days 18's are having a lingering effect.So we took a good break mid-morning and cooled off by a beautiful stream, drank lots of water, and climbed some tiring ascents. The trail wasn't too brutal today but the heat made it work. Right as we were finishing lunch by another stream, thunder started to rumble nearby and it wasn't long before menacing storm clouds rolled in. No surprise with so much energy in the sky. We donned our rain gear to protect from getting over-cooled and started up our last significant climb of the day. Boy did it rain! It poured like crazy all the way up the mountain and for the next half hour. It actually made hiking easier since it quelled the heat. But it was climbing up a gushing stream. By the time we made it to our planned stop, the rain had ceased and we set up drying lines to try and get ready for tomorrow. It's nice to get into camp by 4; it gives you time to get stuff done, eat dinner, relax and recover. Connecticut continues to impress; it's a serious hiking state so far. Oh, I forgot to write the other day about an incident. We were walking through some really tame, flat land and so we were making good time. I was sort of zoned out and, bam, I banged into a large tree limb hanging over the trail with my head at full speed. Never saw it. Like a boxer taking a punch, I went down to my knees in a daze and then fell back on my butt. It didn't knock me out but it knocked me down. I was ok but once again reminded you can never let down your guard on the trail. We are about halfway through our160 mile trek and it's tough but going well. Tomorrow night we are going into Salisbury, CT where we will eat, resupply and stay in a local house where a lady puts up hikers for a fee. Showers and charging of electronics are included in the fee. That'll be a nice break. Speaking of breaks, Charlie asked work today if he could schedule 2 weeks around labor day off so we could finish Maine together. If that works out, I will take a month break between finishing Massachusetts and starting my final segment in Maine. Hike your own hike, as the saying goes.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542164,"Today was a day the way days on the trail are meant to be. It was hot, but not horribly so. It was humid, but not oppressively so.There was a breeze, slight but present. The mosquitoes were there but succumbed to a mild swat. There was one big up and one big down, neither very radical. In between, there was about 4 miles of level walking (some road) and 4 miles of modest woods walking on top of the ridges. There was a huge waterfall in the husatonic river, after which it seems we entered new England. There was a moment when we came off the top of a mountain into an open pasture with a vista north to a great mountain range. We haven't seen a view like that since Virginia and it was awe inspiring. For thru hikers, this was their first glimpse of what will become the green, white, mahousic, and bigelow mountains which make up the last 700 miles of their journey. The long slog through the mid-Atlantic states is over. We got a good start and managed another short day into the town of Salisbury. We are staying with a special hiker host, Maria McCabe, who has been inviting hikers into her home for over 15 years. 87 years young, she thrives off the energy of the trail and seems to live to make our lives more comfortable and entertaining. After showers, laundry, and a burger, we stopped for a minor resupply and ice cream. It's amazing how refreshing these small things are after sweating profusely for several days. Happy with the 'break', we're off in the morning, bound for Massachusetts. Countdown: 251.7 miles left.","Sharon Mtn Campsite

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542165,"Massachusetts starts with a bang. It's marvelous. Bear Mtn, Mt. Race, Mr. Everett. These are real mountains with gnarly climbs, beautiful summits of slab rock and dwarfed trees, blueberries (not quite ready), and mountain laurel (just finishing this year's bloom), and eye popping descents with hundreds of feet of vertical drop you have to pick your way down, frequently using your hands to keep from sliding. I imagine they provide wonderful views as well but I can't vouch for that as we hiked in the clouds all day. It rained much of last night, really cooling things down. When we left town at about 8 am, it was 60 degrees. As we started to climb, we entered a zone of white: hiking inside of a cloud. It was mercifully cool all morning; great hiking weather. As we were about a third of the way down Bear mountain, it began to drizzle and it rained intermittently the rest of the day. Bear mountain descent is so gnarly, there is a bypass trail in the event of bad weather. It is a lot of near-vertical rock and it gets slippery and potentially dangerous. We did fine getting down and had a wonderful walk along a rushing mountain stream for a couple of miles. Somewhere along the way, we passed into Massachusetts. We wound up hiking 3500' up today, the most for me since Virginia. So, it's hard to believe, but just as brutally hot as we were a few days ago, it's actually chilly (and wet) in camp tonight. A nice change of pace and a reminder why I carry a couple of layers of dry, warm clothes and a sleeping bag. When it's raining like this, there's not much to do but hang out in the tent, so taking a nap, journaling, eating, and reading fill the evening. It's really fun to be back to mountain hiking in New England. I'm psyched to finish Massachusetts and pass 2000 miles in a few days. Countdown: 237.5 miles.","Salisbury

Yesterday, my insoles to my shoes delaminated and today my squeeze bag for filtering water sprang a leak. I've got stopgap measures in place so no big deal (can you say duct tape?) but it's weird that these things are happening. Three more days hiking to Dalton, MA, and then another round of logistics. Right now it looks like an afternoon train back to N.Y. and then drive back to Ohio. There's still a chance I'll head to Maine to finish up now but I won't decide that until Wednesday. It continued to rain pretty much all night last night. There was a window of drizzle this morning and we decamped but I wound up eating breakfast in the rain under a tree. We were in a wet cloud again through our initial hike which was pretty easy going. Until we hit the descent. It was slippery and hairy but we made it down. It was on again off again with the raingear as the showers came and went. We had quite a bit of easy hiking across the valley, though much of it was through pretty bad mosquito laden wet areas with boardwalks. At mile 8, we hitched into Great Barrington for a resupply. Just like the other day in Kent, CT, we got offered a ride back to the trail from out front of the market. The good news is we got in and out quickly and back on the trail. The bad news is: No town food. I was looking forward to that but there's plenty of time for that at the end of this week. After town, we climbed up a rather easy mountain and roller coasted to the shelter. For the first time in awhile, we had views as the clouds broke up. Charlie scored a primo tent platform out on the rocks looking east across a big valley to the next mountain range. Maybe by morning this rain will stop (yes, it's raining again) and he'll have a beautiful sunrise.Hiking was pretty easy today although an easy day is still hard work.

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542168,"An easy, short day on the trail. It was either go long short or short long today and tomorrow and short long set up better. The weather was absolutely beautiful. The rain finally stopped and the swirling wind abated. Temps were in the 60's and it was mostly clear. Hiking was a breeze; no hard rock climbs or gnarly sections. The one up was steep but intermittent and the down was steep but with several switchbacks. Most of the walk was through beautiful northern woods with lots of pines, ferns, and gnome-like feeling. We made good time. We camped in a site that was a Shaker village 100 years ago; now it's just some ruins. We had time for a nap and some two-handed Spades with miniature cards Charlie carries. We're planning an early start tomorrow for our last full day. Much of the time this morning I was thinking about what's next. Up until now, I've been thinking I have two choices: go on to Maine and finish the remaining 180 miles or travel back with Charlie and go to Maine in September to finish. Both have been framed by a notion that I am committed to finish this year. It dawned on me this morning that there is a third choice: go back with Charlie now and finish with Charlie next year. On reflection, I realized that it's more important to me to finish with Charlie than it is to finish this year. Finishing with Charlie this year would be tough for him logistically and I have to travel from Florida to Maine whenever I do it. So I think it'll be a 2017 finish. That would mean this year is all about closing the 800 + mile gap between Daleville, Va, and Dalton, MA., and reaching 2000 miles. These feel like really good accomplishments to me and I will be content to achieve them. But first there's 30 miles left to cover. Then busses, trains, and cars to get back to the other world.","Tom Leonard Shltr

Third Half,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542169,"Today started with wonderful, cool weather and smooth trail. We had two almost 1000' climbs today but they were pretty easy. We blasted 12 miles by noon and had good trail magic. The last six miles were like we'd been transported to Maine all of the sudden: roots and rocks in northern piney woods with tons of mosquitoes. It got hotter and more humid as the day went on but it wasn't as bad as the other day. All in all it was a good hike and we got to our camp by 4:30. Time for a nap and then dinner. The mosquitoes are wicked so everyone is in their tent early. Well, this is my last post from the woods for 2016. I decided not to skip ahead to Rangely, Maine to finish my last 186 miles. At least not this year. I will wait until next year when Will I? and I can do it together. It's a bittersweet decision but I feel right about it. Section hiking is disjointed but it gives you the flexibility to choose when you do which areas to maximize good weather and companionship. I have a mixed range of emotions. First is a bit of short jolt as, up until two days ago, I was intent on finishing this year so I still had my 'nose to the grindstone' mentality: nothing can stop me. I feel very positive to have reached the conclusion that being with family is more important than individual goals. I feel a bit of a void for where to put my mental energy after focussing so long on one thing: hiking. I'm sure that won't last long. I feel a sense of accomplishment for seeing it through to here with nary a doubt. My attitude has been positive every day I've been out here. I guess the biggest emotion I feel is gratitude. I'm grateful for the good fortune to be able to do this adventure. I feel grateful that I made it all this way with no injuries or misfortune (other than that 10-day blip of a leg infection). I am grateful for all the visionary people who conceived and put together this trail and to all the committed folks who take care of it every day. It is truly a national treasure. I am grateful to all the folks who helped me along the way, from the unknown drivers who picked up a hitchhiker to the unknown angels who put out magic at road crossings, but especially XC (mom) for maildrops and support,sister Angel Carol for rescuing me and lots more, to cousin Cynthia and Bill for hospitality, rides, and sharing, to Firefly, 30+, and Peggy for hiking with me and giving me a proper sendoff, to Bette for logistic support and a wonderful visit in N.Y. , and to Will I? for continuing to make it a priority for us each to realize this dream of a hike and to do as much of it together as we can manage.

Until today.Today is the last day for 2016 AT. A normal morning's walk; 12 by lunch through northern mountain woods of roots, rocks, short rock climbs,tall grassy rocky meadows, and boardwalk wet areas full of dark water and darker (black) soil followed by a descent into town with hot road walks and a hamburger. But it was not a normal day. At about 9 miles, I hit 2000 miles for my personal trek. There was a moment of euphoric recognition and fist bumping between brothers and then more walking. I had a personal special moment a mile or so later when I (Will I? had gone ahead) started down off the mountain and came to a crystal clear stream,the first nice water in quite awhile. I stopped for awhile, filtered some water (pouring out the skanky water I got from Cookie Lady's house faucet), and took a sponge bath by the creek. This has always been one of my favorite parts of the trail day and I was grateful to have the chance to do it once more. Refreshed and full of relief and satisfaction for where I've been, I prepared to pass through the portal out of the woods and back into the insanity we call normal life. As I descended into town, I had this overwhelming sense of apprehension, knowing I wouldn't have the security and simplicity of the woods and simply walking for quite awhile. My mind raced with thoughts of the logistics of getting out of this trail town back to civilization and, on a larger scale, what to do with myself after I land. In one sense, now I am actually entering retirement and all the choices to be made about how to make it meaningful. I have had a clear purpose for 76 days (66 'on trail' plus 10 off for leg injury) and now I'm entering a world of a thousand possibilities.I've learned that it'll work out; just be honest, positive, and pay attention and good things will happen.
