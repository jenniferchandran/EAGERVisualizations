""While adventure reading is thrilling and adventure watching is exciting, nothing compares to living your own adventure and having your own story to tell."" - Big Steve
On March 12, 2016, I will depart Springer Mountain, Georgia, and attempt to thru-hike the 2189.2-mile Appalachian Trail. During a family visit, my dear mother-in-law inquired about my plans and motivations for hiking the AT. I spent a solid ten minutes explaining my rationale to her. I made a thorough and compelling case. It was so convincing that, upon finishing, I was certain she would not only heartily endorse my trek, but might even join me. Instead, she looked at me, shook her head, and said, “Now why in the world would you want to go and do something like that?”
Why in the world? That’s a fair question…one that all aspiring thru-hikers should try to answer at some point. Here then, in no particular order, are my Top 10 reasons…
1. I love adventure. In my mind I have traveled across the continent with Lewis and Clark, thanks to the novel Undaunted Courage by Stephen Ambrose. I have mentally journeyed into space with the crew of Apollo 13, battled snakes and Nazis with Indiana Jones, and scored the winning goal in Quidditch with Harry Potter. I have imagined picking up giant-slaying stones with David in a hundred Bible classes, and floating with Rose on the raft as Jack sank to the bottom of the ocean in Titanic. In my mind’s eye, I have hiked the AT a thousand times through countless movies, journals, YouTube clips, and books. In fact, the original seed was planted while reading A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson and later Through Hiker’s Eyes, Volumes I and II, by Larry Alexander. While adventure reading is thrilling and adventure watching is exciting, nothing compares to living your own adventure and having your own story to tell. Whether my story will be a tragedy or comedy, featuring a devastating injury or a thrilling final summit, remains to be seen. Either way, it will be an adventure.
2. I love the outdoors. Nothing lifts my spirits, gets my blood pumping, and connects me more with my Creator than a good hike. Lil Jan and I have hiked some impressive trails this year and each time have been amazed at God’s handiwork. His presence is whispered to me throughout the day in all sorts of ways, but God seems to shout his awesomeness when I’m out hiking and thinking in nature. I know I will live to regret this next statement but…I even enjoy hiking in the rain. I will walk two thousand miles in all sorts of conditions. I will get wet and dirty, and will carry a stench like none other. But I’ll be outdoors, staring at countless stars from a mountaintop on a clear night, hanging out with wild ponies and squirrels…and it will be amazing.
3. I love a challenge. Thru-hiking the AT is really, really difficult. It ranks somewhere between running 83 marathons and clothes shopping with your wife while your favorite football team is playing. The total elevation change on the trail is the equivalent of hiking Mount Everest 16 times! Of the 2000 or so crazies who attempt an AT thru-hike each year, about 75-80% fail. Those are bad odds. It has to be difficult in order for the eventual summit at Maine’s Mount Katahdin to mean something. There’s little joy in accomplishing the “Easy” Sudoku puzzle or beating a 5-year-old in chess. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. As my friend, Terry Reeves, once said about mission trips to 3rd world countries, “If it were easy, everybody would be over here doing it. There’s a reason why most people haven’t done it.” Or as a hiker in the movie Everest said, “You suffer for a few days. But for the rest of your life you’re a guy who got to the top of Everest.”

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519741,"My Top 10 Reasons for Thru-Hiking the AT (continued)...4. I love meeting new people, seeing new places, and then writing about them. What will I find around the next bend? Can I run faster than the approaching bear (no), or at least faster than the person hiking next to me (maybe)? Who will I meet at the campfire tonight? What’s their story? What can I learn from them? Can I encourage them in some way, or will I be the one needing encouragement? Will the shower be hot at the next trail town, and will there be an all-you-can-eat buffet to devour? I look forward to the unexpected twists and turns on this journey as much as the expected ones.5. I love planning. I don’t know if this is my military background or what, but I love “assessing variables” and making or revising a plan. In fact, I’m pretty geeky about it. If you want to get the most out of 24 hours in Paris, or 3 days in Italy, I’m your guy. My AT prep has been an obsession…a truly magnificent obsession. I spent over 3 months researching sleeping bags and over 3 hours researching sporks. That’s right…3 hours on sporks. The very thought that I have to get from Point A to Point B, in the forecasted weather, with the projected elevation changes and terrain, using nothing but prayer and what I can carry on my own back…and that my survival depends on it…well, I find that all rather intriguing.6. I love getting in shape. I hope to lose at least 20 pounds on the trail and get a resting heart rate in the 50s. The AT will do that to a person. It’s one of the few activities where you literally can’t eat enough to replenish the 5,000-6,000 calories burned each day. Six months of pigging out and losing weight? Sign me up!7. I want to help Amber and Julio Colon adopt a child. I hope my hike and blog will raise awareness, and some money, to help a really awesome Christian couple fulfill their dream of having a child. More on that later.To be continued...",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Thu",0
Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519742,"My Top 10 Reasons for Thru Hiking the AT (continued)...8. I hope to inspire some 5th and 6th grade students at Foundation Christian Academy. Yes, two Florida classrooms full of students will be tracking my journey and completing some related geography and history assignments. With each hundred miles trekked and each state traversed, they’ll get to move a thumbtack on an AT map on the wall of their classroom. More than that, I really hope that in some small way, I can encourage them to dream big dreams and then go after them. In the Everest movie, Jon Krakauer asks Doug Hansen, “It hurts. It’s dangerous. I gotta ask the question, you know I do. Why?” Hansen responds, “I have kids. They see a regular guy can follow impossible dreams, maybe they’ll do the same.” I hope that’s what at least a few of the FCA students will see in me. Perhaps their first assignment should be to answer the question, “What is a really big dream that you’d like to achieve some day?”9. The timing is right. Carpe diem, folks. It’s time to seize the day. My wife has lovingly and graciously given me the green light. I will embark on this journey less than one month after turning 50. The body and mind aren’t getting any younger. I need to do this before the urge to lie down and grab the balance beam, click on “safe mode”, and coast to the end of my life kicks in. On my deathbed, I want to be able to look back on my life and know that I took some risks and didn’t always play it safe.10. I told my mom I would do it. I don’t know if people can watch things from heaven, but I will hike as if she can. For this hike, and for my life in general, she is among my “great cloud of witnesses” (Hebrews 12:1) I doubt she would be all that concerned whether or not I finish, but I think she would be disappointed if I didn’t follow my dream and make an attempt. As added incentive, my dad has agreed to let me take a teaspoon of her ashes with me, which I will spread at the final summit. I hope some day one or both of my sons will thru-hike the AT and do the same thing with my ashes. (No pressure, fellas.)So there you have it…my reasons for attempting a thru-hike of the AT. I’m not a recently graduated guy in his early 20s trying to figure out what he wants to do in life. I’m not a guy in his 50s facing a mid-life crisis or trying to escape something. I have a great life and, hands down, the greatest wife. And yet, I have my reasons. This is something I must do. I must find out if there is something inside of me superior to circumstance. I must learn to rely on God like never before.Some of you will identify with one or more of my reasons. A few of you will identify with enough of them to join me on the hike…in 2016 or perhaps some day in the future. As for my mother-in-law, I suspect she will read this blog, shake her head, and say, “Now why in the world would you want to go and do something like that?”",,View Entry,"Jan 08, Fri",0
Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520376,"“There is no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing.” –        Sir Rannulph FiennesAs previously mentioned, compiling my AT thru-hike gear and clothing has been a magnificent obsession. Facing 6 months in the wilderness in all types of weather, I must carefully and deliberately choose what I wear and carry on my back. The consequences of poor choices include hunger, hypothermia, injury, chronic discomfort, and possibly quitting the trail. Given the many times I’ve already been asked, “What’s in the backpack?” I thought I’d go ahead and answer that.There are many different philosophies and variables to consider when deciding on backpacking clothes and gear. There are those on a tight budget, whose main consideration is cost. They will sometimes sacrifice quality or functionality in search of the good deal and saving money. They also tend to pride themselves on homemade, old school solutions, like using an old dog food can as a cooking stove, or tree branches as hiking poles. For other hikers, the main consideration is weight, and they will invest in usually more expensive ultra-light gear. They may also go without a stove or sleeping pad, or cut a toothbrush in half, in order to travel as light as possible. Every fraction of an ounce counts and the lighter the load, the more likely you are to make it to the other end. Just as the cost cutters might boast on how little they spent, the ultra-lighters might boast about how little their pack weighs. At the other extreme, there are those who over-pack with too many luxury items or duplicate items. Some falsely assume that what works on a weekend camping trip with the family will work on a 2200-mile journey. Many of them end up sending stuff home or quitting altogether.My approach was to get mostly high quality, lightweight gear, but to bring enough of it for a little more comfort and functionality than what a pure minimalist would have. Yes, I could have gone lighter and I could have gone cheaper. But if I fail, I don’t want it to be because I had insufficient or crappy gear. Here, then, is a breakdown, along with some insights on my rationale. I’ve gone into some detail for the benefit of those who may plan a hike and because I appreciated previous thru-hikers who did the same.The Big ThreeBig Agnes Flycreek UL2, with footprint – 34.4 ounces; ultra light, 3-season, freestanding, double wall tent. Technically a 2-person tent, but better suited for a solo hiker + gear (especially a 6’ 2” hiker). Sets up quickly and kept me dry overnight in a recent torrential downpour. Ideally, the vestibule would be a tad larger, especially when entering/exiting the tent in the rain. I prefer the privacy and quiet of a tent to a shelter unless rough weather dictates otherwise. Also, while I find hammocks a tad more comfortable, I still prefer the privacy, weather protection, and ability to spread out gear and clothing in a tent.ULA Circuit Backpack with pack cover – 41 ounces; 4200 cubic inches (68 liters) in total volume; lightweight, durable, very comfortable. Love the large side and belt pockets. In fact, I love everything about this pack. Designed by a successful thru-hiker and he clearly put a lot of thought into every ounce of it.Western Mountaineering Alpinlite – 33 ounces; 20-degree, 850-fill down sleeping bag; roomy, breathable, and compressible. The most expensive and comfortable piece of outdoor gear I’ve ever owned. The days may be brutal, but I should be warm and comfortable at night.To Be Continued...",,View Entry,"Jan 27, Wed",0
Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520377,"Continued...Other Gear & StuffSea to Summit Reactor Thermolite Mummy Bag Liner – polyester, insulated sleeping bag liner will add up to 15 degrees of warmth to my sleeping bag and help keep it clean. It can also be used on its own as a warm weather sleeping bag.Therma-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm Sleeping Pad – inflatable, soft, warm, and comfortable. Only complaint is that it’s noisy when you move on it. The upside: when people hear “noises” in my tent I can blame it on the sleeping pad.Leki Corklight Trekking Poles – adjustable, sturdy; anti-shock system; comfortable cork handles. Can be used to spear trout.Duct Tape – Tim DeBoef, a friend of mine, once told me that success in life is mostly a result of “duct tape and prayer”. I believe him. I’ll have a few feet worth wrapped around my trekking poles.Black Diamond Spot Headlamp - lightweight, very bright, dimmable, multiple modes. Bring on the night hiking! A gift from my friend, John Walsh. Thanks, John!Sawyer Squeeze Water Filter – light, compact, easy to use.Platypus Water Bladder (2 Liter) – water reservoir, primarily for use in camp.Potable Aqua Chlorine Dioxide Water Purification Tablets – Plan B in case water filter fails. Plan C involves an airdrop from a Charleston C-17.MSR Pocket Rocket with MSR IsoPro fuel – simple, compact, and lightweight canister stove. Boils a liter of water in less than 4 minutes.Fire Starters – Bic lighter, 24 matches in waterproof case, and a UST Mini-Flint Sparker. May be overkill, but I like having multiple ways of making fire that don’t involve rubbing sticks together. Snowpeak Trek 900 Titanium Cookset - set includes a 30 fl. oz. titanium pot, a small titanium fry pan and a nylon mesh storage sack; fry pan doubles as a pot lid. Store stove and fuel inside it. Only complaint is that the pot lid/fry pan doesn’t fit securely on the pot.Snowpeak Titanium Cup – a man has got to have his coffee.Snowpeak Titanium Spork – for eating; can also be used as a shank to kill wolverines.Classic SD Swiss Army Knife – I resisted the urge to buy a big, cool, unnecessary hunting knife. This small, 7-function, lightweight knife has all that I’ll need, including scissors. I can also use it to skin the wolverine that I shank with my spork.Rechargeable Stun Gun Flashlight – Backup light source. Also, mess with me and I’ll put 1 million volts of pure electricity through your veins. (Or, if used incorrectly, through my own veins…which might reverse my sterilization procedure.)Glasses and sunglasses (both prescription) – can hike without them, but prefer the 20/20 vision with them…and not falling off a mountain. Will also bring some contact lenses and solution, although I suspect I will prefer the glasses or going with nothing.Triple-A Batteries – extra for headlamp and flashlight.Shammy – multi-use towel…clean pots, wipe off tent, dry tears, etc.AWOL’s Guide to the AT, by David Miller – full of useful information on shelters, elevations, towns, water sources, etc. I have this in hard copy and another guide downloaded on my phone.Pen w/ small pen light – for note-taking, writing in shelter journals, and writing sentimental heartfelt letters to my wife. 50’ Utility Cord + Small Stuffsack + Carabiner – used together, with a rock, to hang food bag (OPSAK Barrier Bag inside Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil 20L Drysack) on a high enough tree branch so bears won’t get it.Trash Compactor Bag – lines the backpack, providing an extra layer of water protection.Gold Bond Extra Strength Medicated Body Lotion – this gets its own entry because I fear chafing more than I fear bears. This is a result of psychological trauma from literally chafing my nipples off during the 2007 Marine Corps Marathon. At the finish line, I was handed a medal and two Band-Aids. Fortunately, they regenerated like salamander legs. By that, I mean both processes involve regeneration…not that salamander legs grew where my nipples once were. I’ll move on.Toiletries – small toothbrush and toothpaste, wet wipes, sanitizer, earplugs, toenail clippers, Chap Stick w/ SPF. In lieu of toilet paper, I’ll be using wet wipes in conjunction with sage leaves and pinecones, a technique recommended by my friend Larry Alexander. He said I must learn this technique on my own, preferably in a quiet, wooded area far from camp, while listening to Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moon. As for rookies prone to select the wrong type of pinecone, well, that’s where the medicated Gold Bond comes in.First-Aid & Medicine – Band-Aids, gauze pads, sterile bandage, moleskin, blister pads, athletic tape, Neosporin, DEET Insect Repellent, razor blade, needle (to pop blisters), tweezers (tic removal), Vitamin I (Ibuprofen), Tums, Imodium, antihistamine, sting and bite pad, acetaminophen, and Nexium (to be taken in Pennsylvania during the Half Gallon Ice Cream Challenge at Pine Grove Furnace General Store).To Be Continued...",,View Entry,"Jan 28, Thu",0

Patagonia Capilene 2 Lightweight Crew Top & Capilene 2 Lightweight Bottoms – quick drying, highly breathable, moisture-wicking polyester; synthetic base layer top & bottom; 20-UPF sun protection. Ideally, these will remain dry and used at camp/as pajamas. Could also be used as an added layer of insulation in extremely cold weather.Patagonia G1 III Zip Off Pants – tough, lightweight, nylon-taslan pants with zip-off legs; durable water repellent finish and 50+ UPF sun protection.Northface Paramount II Cargo Shorts – abrasion-resistant midweight nylon; large cargo pockets with secure Velcro closures.Marmot Essence Rain Jacket – waterproof, breathable; attached hood, integrated cooling vents; chest pocket. Good in rain and wind; wear alone or in combination with any of the above shirts, depending on conditions.Northface Venture Full-Zip Rain Pants – waterproof, breathable, full-zip pants. Good in rain and wind; wear alone or in combination with any of the above shorts/pants, depending on conditions.Mountain Hardwear Hooded Ghost Whisperer – ultralight (2.1 ounces) nylon insulating jacket; wind and water-resistant.Darn Tough Vermont Men's Merino Wool Socks (2 pair) – Comfortable, well cushioned, moisture wicking.REI Smartwool Merino Wool Sock Liners (2 pairs) – soft, silky merino wool blended with stretch nylon for durability and a good fit; helps prevent blistering.Smartwool Hunting Heavy Crew Socks (1 pair) – Warm, comfortable, cushioned. Mainly for use at camp. Can also be worn as mittens on particularly cold days.ExOfficio Underwear (2 pair) – soft, durable, breathable, moisture wicking; 1 for hiking; 1 for camp.REI Smartwool Balaclava – soft, snuggly, pure merino wool. Keep the head/face warm while hiking or at camp. It makes me look like a cross between a stealth ninja warrior and a dry erase marker.REI Buff – helps keep sweat off face and prevent sunburn.Outdoor Research Versaliner Gloves – Breathable, 100-weight fleece insulating liner and removable waterproof ripstop fabric shell. The zippered back-of-hand shell-storage pocket doubles as a heat pack pocket when conditions turn unexpectedly icy. Oboz Sawtooth Mid Hiking Boots – lightweight, waterproof, comfortable out of the box. These boots have served me well hiking, on mission trips, Habitat projects, etc. Provide some extra ankle protection in the early GA/NC Mountains. Will wear these for the first 1/4 to 1/3 of the hike.Salomon XA Pro 3D Trail-Running Shoes – will switch to these for the second 1/4 to 1/3 of the trail. Synthetic mesh uppers/lining, EVA midsole, rubber outsole. Comfortable, durable, quick drying. These things are beasts. May go with a new pair of these for the last portion of the trail or may go back to the Sawtooths. Spenco PolySorb Walker/Runner Insoles – probably unnecessary, given the quality Sawtooth insoles. But thought I’d give them a try. Increases shock absorption and helps prevent blisters.Crocs – lightweight camp shoes. Important to make a fashion statement at Laundromats.Under Armour Fishhook Cap – helps prevent sunburn and keep rain off eyeglasses.Coghlans Mosquito Head Net – worn over ball cap in heavy bug traffic areas. Can also be used to strain pasta noodles.Chums Surfshorts Wallet – lightweight, durable ripstop nylon.Food and Water 1-Liter Smartwater Bottles – durable, fit nicely in backpack side pockets, easily replaceable. I’ll typically start with 2 full ones, although I could adjust that depending on the projected distance/reliability of the next water source.Food – although a bit more expensive, I will re-supply food in the towns I come to, rather than send multiple mailings to post offices along the way. I like not being tied to a post office schedule, i.e., needing to hike 25 miles in the rain today to get to the post office before it closes for the weekend. I also like the flexibility of buying whatever type of food I’m hungry for in that town, versus the Ramon noodles in a package I sent 2 months ago. Thus, I’ll pay a bit more for food, but that’s offset some by not having the cost of mailing multiple packages. Having said that, I may have Lil Jan mail me just a few food packages (with love notes) at locations which are notoriously expensive or lacking in food options.Loksak Garbage Bag – to pack out garbage.To Be Continued...",,View Entry,"Jan 29, Fri",0

Sir FoB W.

They have huge hearts for God, each other, and kids. They are one day going to be AWESOME parents. Only one significant hurdle remains...raising the remaining funds. $6645 to be exact. That's where you and I come in. Among my 10 previously blogged about reasons for thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail, I want to try to help Amber and Julio close the financial gap so they can bring this adoption to fruition.Before you consider investing in the future of this child, I'd like for you to get to know Amber and Julio a little better...Q: So tell us about yourselves?Julio: My childhood was a blessed one. I was born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico and moved to Cranston, Rhode Island when I was 6 years old. I have one older brother (Ricky) and two younger sisters (Rosa and Gretchen). My father and mother, who met in New York City, provided the best they could for their four children. My dad was the sole provider for the family as my mom was a homemaker. My parents always provided a safe, loving, and God-fearing home. Growing up in my home, we knew that every Sunday and Wednesday we would be going to church. As a young teen, I remember some really great weekends at church youth rallies held throughout the state (and sometimes in other nearby states). My mother made the most amazing food! (recipes and methods that I am happy that she shared with Amber). As I entered my high school years my parents were also very supportive of any extracurricular activities. Friday nights meant that they would come see me play football, or they would try to catch a track meet whenever possible. Deciding to go to a Christian University really impacted my future as it was where I met my wife, Amber. Harding University was truly a blessing for me in many ways. While at Harding, I traveled to Australia and Venezuela on mission trips supporting local churches. Those experiences really opened my eyes to the happenings of this world at a relatively young age (19-­21 years old). While at Harding, I also had the privilege to meet Christians from all parts of the U.S. and even the world. To this day, my time spent at Harding allows me to have connections with brothers and sisters in Christ all over the country. I am now into my fourth year as a teacher at Foundation Christian Academy and just this year also became the Dean of Students. The school has truly been a blessing and has allowed me to grow as a person, a leader, a manager, a role model, a mentor, and a Christian.Amber: My childhood was a happy one. I was blessed beyond measure with a second chance at family via adoption by my mom at age two and my dad at age ten. My Dad and Mom both worked really hard to support us. My dad is a full-time Hospital Pharmacist and unofficial part-time hospital comedian (one of the funniest men I know). He was a huge encourager at my track meets and Show Choir performances. He also encouraged me to join the youth group and introduced me to Church Camp (Highlight of my childhood). My mom is a Respiratory Therapist who spent her time making sure that my 3 other siblings and I had everything we needed. She hosted sleepovers, planned birthday parties, cleaned up after us and made sure we learned tidiness and manners. She would quite literally do anything for any of her children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews.I am the oldest in my family of four children that I grew up with, (three girls and one very lucky well mothered little brother.) I also have four sisters from my biological parents that I have enjoyed reconnecting with over the past few years. I grew up in Northwest Ohio in a pretty small town. My graduating class only had 62 people in it. We lived out in the country for most of my childhood. I have fond memories of running around in our woods with my siblings and cousins, building teepees, hunting for crawfish, and celebrating every holiday with both sides of our families. I graduated from Van Buren High School in 2001 and went to college at Harding University where I met the love of my life, Julio Colon, and graduated with my MRS. Degree. In all seriousness I left college about a semester short of my Bachelors in Business to pursue a career with The Buckle. Which as it turns out, worked out really well for us. (Sorry parent readers, kids stay in school as it might not work out as well for you!)TO BE CONTINUED...",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Fri",0
Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521080,"Continued...Q: When did you become a Christian? Who was the most influential person in you becoming a Christian?Julio: I was raised in the church and do not remember a time when we did not go to church growing up. When I was sixteen years old I decided to be baptized. The most influential people in my walk with Christ have been my parents. My father and my mother have both set an amazing example of what daily Christian living looks like.Amber: I was also raised in the church and have quite a few people who were instrumental to my faith in so many ways. Dauri Shank ,who taught me the basics of the Old and New Testament and showed me unconditional love during a tough transition when my biological dad left. Kathryn Kelly, who humbly demonstrated to me how women and their redeeming stories can be used to lead in the church. Ed and Claudia Beeson, who demonstrated transparency and boldness and showed me what God's grace looks like in the way they were transparent while living their lives as a ""Real"" family in full display of the church as Minister and Minister's Wife. Also, my Grandma Evelyn who embodied what it meant to be a Proverbs 31 wife and who helped me fall in love with singing and acapella music. Last but not least my father, Steve, who showed up, stepped up, and stayed. Without his influence and time and attention he gave me, I wouldn't be who I am today. I also wouldn't have known what to look for in a spouse. He baptized me on Sunday, August 18th, 1996.Q: How did you meet? Was it love at first sight? When did you get married?We met at Harding University during Julio's freshman year and my sophomore year. With a group of mutual friends, we spent our spring break in Daytona Florida. It was there that Julio and I first began to see each other as more than just friends. We spent the next several weeks speaking to each other for hours on the phone. One Wednesday night at a church service we held hands for a prayer (we still hold hands for every prayer). We spent time going to Social Club events, visiting our friend's family homes and hometown congregations, and hanging out at Heber Lake. After about a year and a half, it became clear to both of us that we were better together than on our own and we were ready to get married. Actually, I came from our first date gushing to my roommate that Julio would be who I would marry!  In the summer of 2004, Julio hiked me all the way to the top of Sugarloaf Mountain and proposed under a beautiful pink sunset.Q: What do you do for fun? Any hobbies?Julio: I enjoy exercising and being out in nature. I enjoy working on vehicles and, in fact, do many of the repairs on our vehicles myself. Along with vehicles, I truly enjoy fixing almost anything. I will try to fix things that break in our home before replacing them. Recently, I have also taken to woodworking and have built three different types of tables for Amber as gifts. I also have a deep interest in stocks, investing and financial topics in general.Amber: I also enjoy nature and being outside, exploring parks and hunting for shark teeth on the beach with Julio. I like to metal detect when I get a chance. I love to hike, canoe, and adventure out with my sister. We recently swam with manatees and it was insanely fun and intimidating. I have also recently begun to learn how to fish. I've only caught a sunburn so far, but I still have fun. I have a little homemade sign/craft business called ""The Polished Anchor"". Last year I did four local craft shows to help raise funds for our adoption. I love to cook and love to try new recipes.Q: When did you decide you wanted to adopt a child? Was there a particular moment or was it a gradual process?Amber and I have always wanted children, but deciding to adopt was a gradual process for us. Early in our marriage, Amber wanted to adopt before having any biological children because of the impact adoption had on her own life. After a couple of years of attempting to start a family, we began to pray and seek advice on the matter. In December of 2014, we announced to our parents that we were hoping to adopt and began making plans to make it possible. Amber stepped down as a store manager with her company and found a position that would make the transition into motherhood possible. We knew that if adoption was within God's plan that He would make a way for us financially. In August of 2015, with the support of our family, friends, and colleagues we began to raise funds for an adoption.Q: Take us through the adoption process. What agency are you using? What hurdles have you cleared? What steps remain?The adoption process can be described as a long journey. The process has its emotional ups and downs but in the end it will all be worth it. We are blessed and overjoyed to be using Christian Family Services as our agency. They are truly a Godsend and are a strong Christian support for both the birth mother and the adopting family. We have cleared several hurdles so far including: having our application accepted, having so many kind people write in reference letters, filling out all kinds of forms, meeting for the first half of our home study, and being on track to raise enough money to make this adoption possible. We still have several steps to go including: filling out many more forms, continuing to raise money, completing the second part of our home study, creating a book that birth mothers will view to get to know us, having a birth mom choose us, and filing legal paperwork for the adoption. There are also many little things that need to get done by the time we complete the adoption. Throughout this adoption journey, Amber and I continue to pray and hope in a God that has this adoption and all things under His control.

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521081,"Continued...Q: What are the costs involved in adopting a child? How much have you raised so far and how much remains? Is there a deadline involved to raise the money?Infant adoptions can range anywhere from 30k - ­45k.Thankfully, some friends from church led us to Christian Family Services where we were so excited to find out that our adoption will be around 20K.We set a goal back in September to raise $12,000. As of Feb 1st we have raised $5,355.We still need to raise an additional $6,645.As for a deadline, once we publish our family profile book it will be shown to potential birth mothers. We need to have the rest of the funds to match and then finalize. We are fully trusting God and His timing.Q: You’ve done some crazy things to try and raise the money. Tell us about some of them. What’s the weirdest or craziest suggestion you’ve gotten so far?Oh my Goodness... did ya'll know Mr. Colón can do the Stanky leg? Video link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vXV4I6K7FfgAlso, he can sculpt a flawless #cheeklineVideo link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=psVjD4sjeKMWe have been asked to make more dancing videos!! Including songs like ""Hit the Quan"".Q: Why do you want to be parents? Do you see yourselves adopting a second child further down the road?We have been married going on 12 years and we have had so many adventures with college life, careers, reaching goals and enjoying every moment together. Now we are excited to become a loving family for a child and share life with them.I see us adopting another and, Lord willing, perhaps even a biological baby someday (after all Abraham and Sarah were around 100 years old!).Q: What type of family environment do you hope to have? Is there a particular aspect of your own upbringing that you hope to incorporate into your family life with this child?Amber and I are both in clear agreement that this child (and God willing future children) will be raised in the nurture and admonition of The Lord. As children of parents that raised us in the knowledge of the truth of God, we believe in giving our child a firm foundation in Christ. We hope to instill in our child a love for nature and the beautiful things that God created. We also want our child to pursue their dreams. We hope to nurture both by exposing them to many adventures such as exploring state parks, canoeing, camping, enrolling them in athletic teams, Bible Camps, youth group, and taking them on mission trips (local and international), etc.Q: Are you wanting to adopt a baby or an older child? Why? Will you have a choice in which child you adopt?Lord willing, we are adopting an infant. Yes, we do get a choice in age.We have given much thought to this matter. To be honest, we thought about foster care and that might be something we do the second time around. Many kudos to Foster Mommas and Daddies. It takes an immensely strong faith, thick skin and strong heart to wear both of those hats.As for no, I am not sure I could face giving a child back. We are so excited to become a family and we couldn't enter down the foster care road until we are certain that we are doing it with the right hearts and motives.Q: Will you get to choose the name? If so, any ideas for a boy's name or girl's name?We are deciding the name together, although Amber has a pretty long list of names that she adds to daily with both boy and girl names. What are your ideas, we would love to hear them!?!Q: Will you know the birth mother? Will the child have an opportunity to know or visit its birth mother down the road? What are the pros and cons of that?We hope to have an open adoption. This would mean that we will support and nurture a loving relationship with our birth mother. As an adoptee myself (Amber) I feel that each child is so different when it comes to how they process their family story. So ultimately our child will make those choices.The PROs of open adoption are so many. For the child, a sense of knowing your complete story and not having any secrets or shame to your story. Often times secrets breed feelings of shame.For the birth mother, she has a chance to learn to trust her decision and heal. For the adoptive parents, they get a chance to convey their gratitude and understanding of the gift that the birth mother entrusted them with. We also get a chance to shine our lights for Jesus and love her the way that He does. There is so much negative stigma about birth mothers. We are excited for a chance to love ours.The only CONs in open adoption are the risks of hurts and disappointments but at the end of the day openness, transparency, and love always wins.Q: If Big Steve breaks his leg or gets eaten by a bear on the Trail and thus the pledges don’t materialize, will you forgive him?Amber: Of course, but Lil Jan might not, so you had better play it safe.Julio: Amen to Amber's response! Also, remember that extra hold hair gel mixed with leaves and large sticks makes a great splint for serious injuries. Big Steve: Amber and Julio told me they are already ""blessed beyond measure"" to have your prayers and emotional support. For those who are in a position to help financially, here are some options for you... 1. Pledge a certain amount per mile that Big Steve hikes on the AT. One cent per mile (@2189.2 miles) would come to $21.89, if I complete the entire hike. A nickel per mile would come to $109.46. A dime per mile would come to $218.92. etc. You can pledge by commenting on this blog, commenting on the Facebook post, private message, email (janetandboys@yahoo.com), or text (703-403-8492). Lil Jan will keep track of all that, and once I'm finished , we'll notify you of miles completed and amount pledged. Then, assuming you're able to fulfill the pledge, you can go to the website below to donate.2. Donate a certain amount now, regardless of how far I make it on the trail. Donations can be made at:            www.gofundme.com/babycolontobeEither option is greatly appreciated, but Option 1 will certainly give me added incentive to finish this massively long hike. Thank you for whatever help you are able to provide. Your prayers are especially appreciated. And a huge thanks to Amber and Julio for their willingness to adopt...and allowing us to help them reach that goal.Big SteveQuestions for Miss Walsh/Mrs. Wilkinson's and Mr. Reeve's 5th & 6th Grade FCA Classes:1. Assuming Big Steve hikes all 2189.2 miles (a big assumption), what total amount would have to be pledged per mile to raise all $6645?2. Come up with 3 recommended girl names and 3 recommended boy names for Amber and Julio's adopted baby. Compile them as a class and give them to Mr. Colon.3. What dance would you most like to see Mr. Colon do to raise money? Would it mean more if he did it in front of the whole student body?4. What are some reasons you think Amber and Julio will make good parents?5. Do you know anyone who is adopted? If you are comfortable doing so, please share his/her/your story with your class.",,View Entry,"Feb 13, Sat",0
Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522220,"""With music, you don't often have to translate it. It just affects you, and you don't know why.""    - David Byrne""Ah, music! A magic beyond all we do here!""    - Albus DumbledoreI have the most eclectic taste in music of anyone I know. Survey the couple of thousand songs in my iTunes library and you'll have a hard time pinning down a particular favorite genre or artist. You'll find everything from George Jones to Van Halen, and from The Commodores to the Electric Light Orchestra. A recent training hike music shuffle took me from Kirk Franklin to Frank Sinatra to Def Leppard. That’s a little weird, I know. Although I've been inspired and motivated by music during each of my five decades of life, I suppose I like the 80s music of my teenage years the best. In fact, if you're putting together an 80s music trivia team, you’d be well served to pick me first.While I'll have access to thousands of songs to listen to on the Appalachian Trail, I decided to put together a 15-song playlist to listen to as I begin each morning's hike. (After that, I’ll listen to birds and talk to other humans.) Each song has a special and unique meaning to me. Together, they will energize me as I take on rain, pain, and elevation gain. Yes, after prayer, coffee, and a bagel covered in peanut butter, it's music that will fuel the first few miles out of the gate each day. Hunter Thompson puts it this way:“Music has always been a matter of Energy to me, a question of Fuel. Sentimental people call it Inspiration, but what they really mean is Fuel. I have always needed Fuel. I am a serious consumer. On some nights I still believe that a car with the gas needle on empty can run about fifty more miles if you have the right music very loud on the radio.”Here then, are the songs that will fuel my journey as I hit the trail each morning for the next 6 months, and why they made the cut.Revelation Song – This amazingly uplifting song, awarded Worship Song of the Year at the 2010 Dove Awards, was recorded by contemporary Christian group Phillips, Craig and Dean. Band member Randy Phillips explained the group’s rationale: “This song captures the moment of looking up into Heaven, peeling back the curtain of eternity so we can peek in. If you keep your eyes on the Dow Jones or nuclear weapons in North Korea, you’ll always be nervous. Look to the awesomeness of God instead.”I can’t think of a better way to start the day than to look up to the heavens at the awesomeness of God and sing, “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, holy holy is He. Sing a new song, to Him who sits on, heaven’s mercy seat. Holy, holy, holy…the Lord God Almighty…who was and is and is to come!” I get chills every single time I hear this song. It’ll be even chillier when I hear it on Mount Washington.I Lived – This inspirational song was recorded by American rock band One Republic in 2014. Band member Ryan Tedder, who wrote this song for his 4-year-old son, said “The whole idea, to quote the late great Robin Williams from Dead Poets Society, is 'carpe diem'."" He said, ""It's absolutely universal and applicable to everybody."" Regarding the lyric ""With every broken bone, I swear I lived,"" Tedder said, ""So for every day that you're on this earth, for every minute that you have, the whole idea is doing nothing less than exactly what you feel you're supposed to do and squeezing every last drop out of life every day, regardless of the difficulties or trials that you face.""As great as the song is, the music video is even better. It’s dedicated to Brian Warnecke, a 15-year-old fan of the band, who suffers from cystic fibrosis.   Just as the song inspires Brian to keep fighting and to live every day to its fullest, it will inspire me to keep hiking and to try to live my life to the fullest as well. To Brian and my fellow thru-hikers, I hope we each can say, “I owned every second that this world could give. I saw so many places, the things that I did. With every broken bone, I swear I lived.”To Be Continued...",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Sun",0
Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522221,"Continued...Mighty to Save – This 2006 worship song was released by Hillsong Church, although I’m going with the Hallal Music version. As a hiker, I love the line, “Savior, he can move the mountains” although I really just want him to help move me over the next mountain. The song reminds me of God’s love, mercy, compassion, and forgiveness. It also reminds me that, despite my fears and failures, I need to try to let my light shine…to help and encourage others whenever I can. If I don’t do that on the AT, it will have been a failed walk, regardless of how far I go.Home – This 2012 song was the coronation song for American Idol winner Phillip Phillips. According to co-writer Greg Holden, “the song is about a friend who was going through a very difficult time, and it was his way of reaching out and saying that ‘you know someone's here for you’"".When I hear this song each morning, I’ll think about Janet. As a highly mobile military family and now full-time RVers, we think of home not so much in terms of brick and mortar, but relationships and experiences. I’ll be motivated to finish the trail to see her, because to me she is “home”…at least until I get to the home sung about in the Revelation song.As a thru-hiker, I also find meaning in the lyrics, “As we roll down this unfamiliar road”…and “just know you're not alone.” Later, he says, “Don't pay no mind to the demons they fill you with fear. The trouble—it might drag you down. If you get lost, you can always be found.” So I’ll think of my wife and remember that she’s right there with me in spirit. If I keep walking, and block out the “demons” of fear and doubt, I’ll eventually find my way back to her…to home.Mirrors – Justin Timberlake recorded this song in 2013 for his 20/20 Experience album. According to JT, it’s a love song about a person's other half and is inspired by the marriage of his grandparents. He said, ""One of the most valuable things in a relationship is being able to constantly change and be individual, but look to the other side to the person that you're with and know that they're changing as well individually, but somehow you two can mirror each other and be the other half of that world that you both create.""That is really cool and deep and meaningful, but honestly, I just like the way the song sounds. Rolling Stone critic Jon Dolan describes Timberlake's singing on the song as ""replete with laidback soulfulness, mountain-climbing croon and falsetto butter.” Falsetto butter? Did he just call JT margarine? I have no clue what that means but I think I agree with it…especially the mountain-climbing part! All I know is this song became popular as I was training for the Disney Marathon, and it got me through the final mile on many, many training runs in and around the Fishhawk subdivision of Lithia, Florida.Beautiful Day – My first experience with U2 music was listening to Sunday, Bloody, Sunday in my friend Jeff Goss’ car as we drove to school and around McGuire AFB, NJ during our senior year of high school. Windows rolled down. Music blaring. Yes, that was us. By the end of the year, the lyrics “how long, how long must we sing this song?” began to take on new meaning. Although that song is a classic 80s song, I instead went with the more recent Beautiful Day. Lead singer Bono explained that the upbeat track is about losing everything but still finding joy in what one has.On the Appalachian Trail, I will temporarily lose an awful lot, but not everything. This song will remind me that no matter how bad the day may seem (weather, hunger, homesickness, etc.) it can actually be a beautiful day if I look for the joy in it. Psalm 118:24 states, “This is the day the Lord has made; We will rejoice and be glad in it.” In fact, if (when) I start whining, I hope someone out there will remind me it’s a beautiful day.Don't Stop Believin' – For starters, Journey’s Escape album came out in 1981 at the height of my music listening teen years. It would become my most listened to album of my high school years, a title held by Styx’ The Grand Illusion during my middle school years. Escape was the first album that I remember thinking that every song on it was really good. While loudly singing Open Arms alone in my room as a 9th grader, I realized just how bad of a singer I was. Even the dog walked out.Steve Perry was inspired to write Don’t Stop Believin’ while on tour in Detroit in 1980, staring out a hotel window at 2 a.m. Perry said, “I was digging the idea of how the lights were facing down so that you couldn’t see anything. All of a sudden I’d see people walking out of the dark, and into the light. And the term ‘streetlight people’ came to me.”Anyway, I jammed to Don’t Stop Believin’ as a high school student. Then, thirty years later, I watched my own students at Foundation Christian Academy jam to the same song as part of a campus-wide lip dub. Thus, the song reminds me not only of my high school years but the fun that I had teaching and getting to know the youngsters at FCA.To Be Continued...",,View Entry,"Feb 29, Mon",0
Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522222,"Continued...The Spirit of Radio (Live) – This song was released by Canadian rock band Rush towards the end of my 8th grade year. I had a room to myself down in the basement in our Dover, Delaware home and I would listen to Rush and Cheap Trick at Budokan (“I want you…to want…ME!) on my totally cool 8-track tape player. I played air guitar and air drums while singing along with Geddy Lee’s high-pitched voice. Years later The Spirit of Radio would become an “insanely hard” song to master on Guitar Hero. On the trail, I will focus on just hiking and singing the song, but will imagine my friends Jeff Hernandez and Jonathan Smith right behind me, deftly handling the air guitar and air drum portions of this song, respectively. If I make it to the halfway point (approximately Harpers Ferry, WV), I will replace this song with Rush’s Limelight and/or Tom Sawyer for a little variety.Counting Stars – A second One Republic song made the cut for two reasons. First, it’s got a great rhythm to it that makes you want to hike fast. Second, I love the opening lyrics… “Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep, Dreaming about the things that we could be. But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard, Said, no more counting dollars…We'll be counting stars, yeah we'll be counting stars.” For me, it’s a reminder of a process that Janet and I worked through a couple of years ago, and a decision that came out of it. We were comfortable, making okay money, buying increasingly nicer homes, and accumulating material possessions. I guess you could say we were living the American dream. Most of my military peers retired and then returned as well-paid contractors, with the potential for double pensions down the road, tremendous wealth, and an even more comfortable retirement. We made a conscious decision to divert from that path, sell our house, and unload most of our possessions. Rather than work another two decades accumulating wealth and things, we decided to travel the country by RV, serve others, and accumulate experiences/memories. Metaphorically speaking, we’ve chosen “counting stars” to “counting dollars”. While that decision is not possible, practical, or desirable for everyone, it has worked out well for us so far and we have no regrets.Lose Yourself (Radio Friendly version) – Rapper Eminem wrote this song while filming his first movie, 8 Mile, and the song is featured in the movie. The movie is based on his life growing up in a poor Detroit neighborhood, dreaming of rap stardom.The first time I heard the song, I had no clue what he was talking about. The best I could tell, a Globetrotter named Rabbit was throwing up his mom’s spaghetti on his sweater. Over time, I have come to appreciate his passion and borderline anger in the song. Elite runners and other athletes, of which I am not, often use anger or a “killer instinct” to succeed. As strange as it may sound, you can get “angry” at the runner in front of you, generating a little extra fuel to catch him, especially at the end of a race. In the movie, the young rapper is trying to succeed and make a name for himself in the highly competitive rap world, and he’s facing a once-in-a-life opportunity. He realizes the magnitude of the moment, and he is, quite simply, all in. His passion, anger, desperation and focus combine to help him achieve his dreams.Like the previously mentioned song Mirrors “fueled” the training for my second marathon, Lose Yourself did the same for my first. I’m hoping I will find it just as inspirational going up and down the 400 mountain ranges of the AT. The last 10 words in the song are perhaps the most inspirational...""You can do anything you set your mind to, man."" Powerful words. Like Rabbit, I feel like I realistically have one shot, one opportunity, to thru-hike the trail. Will I capture it, or just let it slip? Yo.Crazy Train – This heavy metal offering from Ozzy Osbourne is supposedly about the Cold War and learning to love in a world gone mad. For me, it’s just a fun song with a lot of energy. I picture a bunch of us crazy thru-hikers getting up to head out each morning aboard our own “crazy train"". I imagine the guitar player from Mad Max Fury Road out in front of the pack, and I’m in the back yelling, “All aboard! Hahaha!”Fun Fact: The sound at the end of the song is a studio engineer saying ""An Egg"" through an oscillator. Ozzy had asked him what he had for breakfast that morning.   Now you know.What Goes Around…Comes Around – This second JT song to make the cut is about a relationship that collapses because of cheating. Specifically, JT’s friend Trace Ayala was dating the actress Elisha Cuthbert (known as Kim Bauer in the television series 24). Ayala let a friend crash at his place, and the friend took up with Cuthbert, which Ayala found about later in a tabloid. The lyrics “Don’t want to think about it. Don’t want to talk about. I'm just so sick about it. Just so confused about it” were actually spoken by JT to Trace as they discussed the sad situation.The closest connection I have with that situation was my relationship with Karen R. in 5th grade at Reilly Brown Elementary School in Dover, DE. She was the prettiest girl in our school…long brown hair with a darling Michael Strahan-ish gap between her front teeth. She was way out of my league. Still, I had the guts to call her and ask her to “go steady” with me on a Monday of Spring Break week. Amazingly, she said, “Yes”. I think it might have been my 8-track tape player. Anyway, she called me back on Wednesday to tell me that she thought we should see other people. It had been two days, folks! I hadn’t even seen her that week! Am I still bitter? You bet I am! I told my best friend, Jeff Ensslin, about it as we headed to the creek behind Fiddlers Green to go fishing. He said something to the affect, “Don’t want to think about it. Don’t want to talk about. I'm just so sick about it. Just so confused about it.”As for the song, though, I mainly like it because it has a good hiking rhythm to it. It’s also a song that reminds me of my two awesome sons, Jason and Kyle, as together we have jammed to that song hundreds of times since it came out in 2006.To Be Continued...",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Tue",0
Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522224,"Continued...I Was Brought to My Senses – Sting is one of my all-time favorite artists, and I could have chosen any number of his songs as a solo artist or during his time with The Police. His Mercury Falling album, and this song in particular, is about appreciating nature, the changing of the seasons, and relationships. Although the song wasn’t a big hit for him, I absolutely love it…especially while listening to it out in nature.One of his fans perhaps said it best…“I think this is just one of the most beautiful songs in the world. Lyrically, musically, the voice, the guitar...It's about when you first fall in love with someone and suddenly the world is brighter and more beautiful. You notice everything and just appreciate it all. The first verse he is wondering what could happen between them, he sees the birds, takes it as a sign, and makes his move. The rest of the song is that first morning after telling her he loves her. He sees everything even more clearly and wonders why he did not notice the rest of the signs before.”I especially like the lyrics, “I walked out this morning…it was like a veil had been removed from before my eyes. For the first time I saw the work of heaven, in the line where the hills had been married to the sky. And all around me every blade of singing grass, was calling out your name and that our love would always last.” The song, and that line in particular, remind me of an awesome God who created the sky, mountains, and grass…and of an awesome lady who God also created and gave to me as a very special gift.Paradise – Coldplay’s Chris Martin explains that the album Mylo Xyloto is a story. “It's supposed to be about two people who grow up separately in a very big oppressive city, and they each are a bit lost in their lives. The pair meet in a gang and fall in and out of love before getting back together at the end. Paradise is about a girl really, the female half of the album, just about being a bit lost in the world and escaping through fantasy.""The girl in the song has high expectations for life and dreams about them. But she grows ups, faces difficulties, and becomes disillusioned. Ultimately, she responds with optimism and hope for the future…”I know the sun must set to rise.”I suspect thru-hiking the AT is something like that…high expectations, followed by difficulties and some disillusionment. That's followed by optimism, hope, and perseverance…or pessimism, hopelessness, and quitting. I’m hoping for the former, so that I can reach the final summit singing, “Para-para-paradise, Para-para-paradise, oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh.”Give Me Your Eyes – Last but certainly not least is perhaps my favorite song of all-time (slightly edging out Don’t Stop Believin’). The song's meaning originated with a discussion between Brandon Heath and his friend and fellow songwriter, Jason Ingram. “We had a conversation over Chinese food that we wished we could have God’s perspective on things"", Heath said. ""If we did have His perspective, we'd wish we could have it for long periods of time, rather than just for a few seconds. That was the beginning.""What a powerful concept…wanting to see the world as God would, and having a desire to view people with more compassion. We…well, let me just say I, have a real tendency to go through the day focused on myself. Am I comfortable? What and when will I eat next? Am I happy? Are all my needs being met? Jesus, on the other hand, went through life focused on the needs of others, showing compassion at every turn.In 1 Corinthians 9:19, Paul says, “Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible.” Making oneself a slave to everyone is a foreign concept in the self-centered, big ego, materialistic world we live in today. Few choose Christ and His others-centered path, which may be why it’s called the narrow path.So my hope is that this song will remind me, every morning, to try to live a little more like Jesus. “Give me your eyes for just one second.?Give me your eyes so I can see,?everything that I keep missing.? Give me your love for humanity.?Give me your arms for the broken-hearted…ones that are far beyond my reach. Give me your heart for the ones forgotten. Give me your eyes so I can see.”I’d say that’s pretty good advice to end an AT thru-hike playlist with…and a blog.P.S. 10 days till launch!",,View Entry,"Mar 02, Wed",0
Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522765,"While Steve does most of the blogging about our adventures, I wanted to share my thoughts as I get ready for Steve to begin his AT thru-hike on Saturday. Thru-hiking the AT has been a bucket list and dream of his for so many years. Way back in 2004 when we lived in Virginia and would talk about it, I secretly never thought it would come to fruition. Well, I’m eating those thoughts now!Steve plans to depart on March 12th from Springer Mountain, GA and, if all goes well, will be gone for about 6 months. Many of my friends and family have asked me how I feel about this whole thing, so I decided to jot down my thoughts. I typically joke about it and say I’m glad he’s finally getting to do it so I don't have to listen to him talk about it anymore and so he can quit obsessing over it all the time. And to set the story straight, he has assured me that this is not his attempt to get some time away from me after literally living together for 10 months in 480 square feet in “a van down by the river.”I also have been asked many times why I’m not going with him. My answer to that is… “It’s not my crazy bucket list item!” Although I do enjoy hiking and being out in nature, I just don’t feel the draw to go that far and spend that many nights in a row in a tent on the ground! Even though I'm sure I would enjoy much about the experience, for me, the cons far outweigh the positives. Having said that, I know Steve’s experience will be much better if he’s not having me around to slow him up and complain about how my feet hurt, or I'm too hot, or I really need a bath!I’m actually excited for him to be able to begin this bucket list adventure because I know how much he wants to do it, but I’m also very anxious and worrisome about it. Dwelling on the “what ifs” and negatives of his hike is something that I struggle with every day. In all areas of my life I try not to be a “Negative Nelly” but it is something that I have to fight against. In reaction to his hike, I will have to remind myself everyday to think about the positives (the nature experience, the camaraderie with his fellow hikers, the majestic views he will enjoy, his sense of accomplishment, and of course, the protection of the Almighty watching over him). I will have to keep my mind away from the “what ifs”, like “what if he gets lost, what if he gets hurt, what if he gets mugged by some crazy hiker, what if he’s in the middle of a bad storm, what if he runs out of water, what if he gets bitten by a snake and of course, the obvious…WHAT IF HE GETS MAULED BY A BEAR like Leo DiCaprio in The Revenant!” Those kinds of thoughts will only make my next 6 months miserable. Therefore, I am going to try very hard not think about those things! He has told me that I cannot start worrying unless I haven't had any contact or text from him within 7 days. I can't promise not to worry, but I promise not to call the Forest Ranger to go find him before the 8th day of no contact!As for my plans for the next few months, I plan to spend quite a bit of time with my family in SC and visiting with friends around the country. One of the added blessings will be spending several weeks with my aging parents, which I know will be something that I will cherish for a long time. I plan to meet Steve 3 or 4 times at various trail towns along the hike and will mail him a few care packages along the way. We also have a wedding coming up in May that gives me something to be excited about! As a military wife, I was lucky to only have Steve gone on one long deployment for about 5 ½ months in his 23-year career. When he was in Afghanistan I had many things to worry about regarding his safety, but I had a house to keep and the kids at home to keep my mind and life busy. This time around, it’s just me and I don’t even have a typical “home” to hang out in. I will have to depend on my friends and family to house me and keep me busy! I like to think of myself as a pretty independent woman, but I’m sure doing things on my own for the next few months will get old after awhile. I will certainly miss my best friend that I’ve been living life with for the past 28 years!I am happy that so many of our family and friends, new and old, are following Steve’s journey and supporting him while he’s living out this crazy dream. He will certainly look forward to reading all your posts and supportive comments on our blog or through Facebook, as will I. We solicit your prayers for both of us as we embark on this journey.I guess I will finish up my thoughts here with a note to my dear, sweet husband…I am so proud of you for having the determination and drive to follow your dreams! I’m glad that we are at a point in our life that this dream is becoming a reality for you. I can promise you that I will pray for you daily (most likely multiple times each day), that I will miss you terribly (the good and the bad), that I will try not to worry TOO much (can’t promise that I won’t worry at all), but most importantly I promise you that I will LOVE YOU FOREVER!Be safe, my love, and come back to me in one piece as soon as you can!!Lil Jan",,View Entry,"Mar 03, Thu",0
Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523533,"The mountains are calling and I must go. - John MuirI don't know how this hike will end, but the beginning was fantastic! A fellow sojourner, Maureen, arranged for Lil Jan and me to spend 2 nights in a cabin not far from Springer Mountain. The cabin belongs to her friend, and our new friend, Arlin...thank you, sir! Turns out Arlin is the father of Terry Chapman, who we know from our FL Bible Camp days. Small world. The cabin was right on the Toccoa River and a perfect place to be.On Friday, we headed to Amicalola Falls State Park with Maureen and Arlin, and met up with a bunch of family...my Dad, sister Ellen, her hubby Vin, her daughter Lizzie, Jan's sister Carol, her hubby Scott, and Vin's brother Tim. We hiked up the Falls (killer steps!), ate at the lodge, and checked out the visitors center. I also registered for my hike...I'm hiker #564 to start the trail this year. That night Janet carbo loaded me up with chili and pasta. I slept surprisingly well, even though I was a tad anxious.Saturday morning we all rendezvoused at the Springer Mountain parking lot. That was no small feat as the 6 mile Forest Road 42 leading to the parking lot was gravel and full of potholes. Thankfully we were in a Honda Fit.    We then headed up the .9 miles to the Springer Mountain summit and southern terminus of the AT. We took some photos, I signed the logbook and then I took the first of what I hope will be about 5 million steps. Back down at the parking lot we circled up and Vin led us in prayer. I then hugged everyone, kissed my wife, and almost cried. So many emotions were going through my head. I can't express how cool it was having all those folks there. Or the texts and Facebook posts from all over...even high school friends that I haven't seen in 30+ years! I have truly felt the love and support and encouragement. I carry a piece of each of you with me. If you want that piece back, see my son Jason...he does prosthetics!About 100 yards down the trail I sensed a guy on my tail. I turned and asked him if he was going to Maine. He said yes so I gave him a fist pump and we've been hiking buddies ever since. His name is Matt and he recently graduated from UNC-Wilmington. Loves jazz music and reminds me a lot of Luke Larsen, for those who know him. He decided to take a year off before starting law school. He's a competitive rifle and pistol shooter which I thought might come in handy hunting wolverines but he's not packin. He has a slightly faster motor than me on the up hills...probably because hes's not 50 and chunky.Our first day of hiking was beautiful and unseasonably warm. I stopped at the Stover Creek Shelter privy to relieve myself because apparently the thousands of trees in every direction weren't good enough for me. We met several other hikers there and later at the Hawks Mountain shelter. We learned that a woman had to medically evacuated from there because she spilled boiling water on her leg while cooking. Sorry to hear that. Matt and I ended up camping on the top of the first hill north of Hightower Gap. I had beef stew and peanut butter and crackers for supper. We hung our bear bags, built a fire, and set up camp. It had been a near perfect 8.8 mile day 1 and I dozed off to sleep about 9pm.","Springer Mountain

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523539,"The heavy rain and wind gusts started about midnight. I was kind of excited about it because I wanted to test everything out early on the hike. I stayed warm and dry in my UL Flycreek 2 tent. Matt didn't fair so well in his hammock and tarp. In fact he got soaked. I felt bad for him but he bounced back pretty quickly.I got up at 7:30, packed up in the rain, and ate the pop tart that had been sitting in the bottom of my food bag for the past 2 months of training hikes. It was basically brown sugar cinnamon sawdust. Sassafras Mountain, at 3347 feet, was my first butt kicker. It's not as difficult as what lies ahead, but it's difficult because your lungs and legs are still getting acclimated to these altitudes. The moderate rain didn't help. My glasses were fogging up so I took them off...causing my vision to fog up.Our luck improved around noon as the sun came out and we had lunch and got water at the beautiful Justus Creek. Later we paid a visit to Gooch Gap shelter and talked to several hikers. One guy was a 50 year old pastor from Belleville IL (where we used to live) who has a son who spent 2 years at Harding University where Kyle and Jason go/went. A short time later, at Gooch Gap, we got our first trail magic!!! A former thru hiker, Sticks, is spending his Spring break making hot dogs for hikers. He asked if I wanted one. That answer will always...ALWAYS, be yes! Pretty cool, selfless thing to do on your week off. I ate it in 2 bites.We finished our 10.2 mile day atop Ramrock Mountain. It's the 2 of us and 2 young ladies from Indiana University. Don't worry honey we're only sharing a bear bag line as they didn't have one. It's been a good day...the only downside being Matt's soaking hammock (which eventually dried out) and a couple blisters on my heels which I treated tonight. And I miss Lil Jan. Supper tonight was 2 packages of Ramen noodles (beef and chicken) with a packet of tobasco sauce. I haven't pooped in 2 days so I'm hoping that will stir the pot. (If that's TMI for you, you're reading the wrong blog!)Very grateful to be here, and grateful for the folks cheering me on. Looking forward to tackling Blood Mountain tomorrow and possibly getting to Neels Gap, where we may stay the night to shower and re-supply.God is good all the time.","Hightower Gap

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523668,"TMI Alert -- You've Been WarnedDay 3Since about the time I turned 40, I've had 2 health things to deal with...acid reflux and frequent urination. Both problems joined forces and made for an interesting night on Ramrock Mountain.The Beef Ramen noodle, Chicken Ramen noodle, and tobasco sauce trifecta began working their magic both north and south of my stomach. I popped some Tums at 2 a.m. which quelled the reflux. The real issue that night, though, involved urination.Apparently as men get older, their prostates grow. I believe mine is probably about the size of a can of tuna. The doc told me it pushes on the urethra (which, quite frankly, sounds like something only women should have) and this irritates the bladder walls, which contract, making you have to pee. So for most nights over the past decade, I get up at 3 a.m., shuffle to the bathroom, relieve myself, then crawl back into bed. In an RV this is really easy because you just take one full stride, do a left face, and fire away.That's all well and good in a house or RV, but not so fun in the wilderness at 3 a.m. in all sorts of weather. So I brought a Mountain Dew pee bottle. Before judging me, hear me out. It's ultra-light. It fits neatly in the side pocket of my backpack. I'm in a Flycreek 2 tent, which implies pants fly and creek or stream. There's a technique that can work...and did work at 3 a.m. on our first night on the trail. First you get up on your knees, placing the top of your head at the top of the tent. Ideally you'd have 3 hands...one to hold the bottle, one to aim with, and one to hold a small flashlight. (Headlamps are not recommended as they illuminate the tent and may cast an awkward silhouette.) With only 2 available hands, this must be done in the dark. You assume the position, aim, fire, put the lid on tightly, and go back to sleep. Then empty the bottle the next day. Why no one has written about this technique in all the AT guides and books I've read is beyond me. It's called The Johnson Method and it worked beautifully on night 1 near Hightower Gap.Night 2 at Ramrock...not so much. I made a critical mistake. As I rose up on my knees, they were on the air mattress rather than straddling it. I grabbed the bottle, aimed, and fired. About 6 ounces in, all was well. As the Mountain Dew bottle warms up, you know good things are happening. Then disaster struck. About mid-stream, my left knee slid off the side of the air mattress, sending me in to a topple. Your instincts are to reach out and catch yourself, but there were no available hands! In moments like this, mid-stream, job 1 is to keep the Mountain Dew bottle connected to the mother ship. So I held on for dear life and fell over sideways with my head and shoulder hitting the side of the tent. But I kept firing. At age 50, there's no way to turn off the spigot until the tank is empty. I laid there for a moment...relieved that I wasn't injured...and just relieved in general. As I lay there on my side, my next issue was that the bottle cap was on the other side of the tent. So with all the energy I could muster I swung my legs around while maintaining the link up with the mother ship. I grabbed the bottle cap with my toes like a ballerina and swung back around. I then leaned the bottle up, capped it, and rolled back onto the air mattress. Tragedy averted! It's the unexpected things on the AT, the surprise moments, that will make or break you. Ya gotta rise to the occasion or urine big trouble.Matt and I left Ramrock about 8:15. About 20 minutes into the hike, I got that rumbling in my stomach. The tobasco-laced Ramen noodles had worked their way through my digestive track. I knew Woody Gap was near and had an actual toilet. And so, in answer to the question, ""Woody finally go on day 3?""...the answer is he would. In honor of the occasion, I renamed the location He Would Gap.After a peanut butter, trail mix, and beef jerky lunch at Jarrard Gap, we made our way toward Blood Mountain. It is the 6th tallest mountain in Georgia and the tallest AT mountain in Georgia. Some say the mountain was named after a bloody battle between the Cherokee and Creek Indians. Others say it's based on the reddish color of lichen and Catawba near the summit Others say the Bloods beat the Crips there in some gang warfare. (Just 1 person said that.) Sadly, what's for certain is that it was the location where a hiker named Meredith was murdered in 2008. The killer is in prison for life.We ascended blood mountain in the rain. On the way up, we saw a few birds...the first wildlife of any kind so far...besides one salamander. It was a long ascent but not too difficult other than my right heel was bleeding a bit. We hung out with some hikers at the Blood Mountain shelter for awhile and shot a video clip that wasn't audible due to the wind. The descent was more challenging due to the wet rocks (lots of them to scramble over) and the wind. I'd hate to be a south-bounder going up that side. On the way down we passed 3 New Yorkers also planning to stay at the Walasi Yi hostel for the night. That would prove to be a key pass, as when we got there around 5, we got the final 2 remaining bunks.First order of business, even before showering, was to eat. I drank a Diet Coke that was magical. Matt and I then split a large 3-meat pizza. I then ate a burrito and then an apple and then drank a Ginger Ale and a PowerAid. I was just starting to fill kinda full when 15 students from Armstrong State University in Savannah came rolling in with baked ziti, salad, and bread. So I ate it. These youngsters do this on Spring Break as part of a Christian ministry outreach and we really appreciated it.We got a shower, did laundry, and got to know a wide assortment of humanity. Among the cast of characters was Book in Boots, an Australian lady who bunked below me. There were two Indiana University ladies who we shared a bear bag line with on Ramrock...one is a competitive cyclist and one wants to be a brain surgeon. Next there was Emily, a very kind and interesting transgender photographer from Houston. A lady about my age named Driftwood was there with Wildwood, her 20 year old special needs son. They are attempting a thru and I really admire that. Several of us stayed up til 10:30 watching The Matrix and burping ziti.My final challenge of the night was climbing up to the top bunk with sore feet and a sore body. I finished off the day listening to an excellent sermon by my friend and former fellow teacher, Donald Ballard. (Thanks Ross and Crafton for putting these on the web.)I was in a warm bed, with a bathroom nearby, and my Mountain Dew bottle was securely tucked away in my backpack.Big Steve","Ramrock Mountain

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523991,"After much reflection and consideration, I have accepted the trail name...Sir Fob W. Pot. It can be shortened to Sir Fob or simply Fob.I will share the back story, or at least a version of it that I know. I don't know all the specifics, but I think I have the general gist of what went down. Several years ago, when my youngest son Kyle (now a college senior) was in about 9th grade, he went on an Adventure Trek with Larry Alexander and 20 or so other teenagers. Larry is an AT and PCT thru hiker (trail name: Baro), friend, author, and my AT mentor. He takes groups out into the wilderness for several days of team-building, hiking, and rappelling.One evening, as the group descended into their campsite, Kyle was left with the impression that they would be hiking out the opposite way the following morning. About 10pm, nature called in a big way. Kyle felt the rumble in his tummy and needed to act quickly. As there was no privy, the proper procedure was to go into the woods, a good 30-50 yards away from camp, dig a hole, do your business, bury it, and return to camp. Above all else, you are to ""leave no trace."" This is an established camping principle dating back at least to the time of Noah.Kyle, with a still developing frontal lobe, decided to divert from the operating manual. Maybe he was scared...or lazy...or simply trying to beef up his résumé to get into the Knights social club at Harding one day. Whatever the motivation, he headed back up the same trail the group came in on, dropped his trousers around his ankles, and in a moment of moral weakness, in the light of the moon, took a massive dump in the center of the trail. Perhaps immediately realizing his grave mistake, he sprinkled a few leaves on top for good measure and walked back down the trail to camp.The next morning, Baro assembled the young hikers and told them they would be hiking back out the way they came in. Kyle's eyes widened and he immediately got a big lump in his throat (but not nearly as big as the lump he had criminally left sitting 50 yards up trail with a few leaves on it).As they approached the Kyle pile, Baro immediately spotted it and tried to shield the eyes of the younger hikers, but it was too late. An avid outdoorsman, Baro closely examined it and revealed what others suspected...this was a pyramid of human waste. So he circled the troops around this disgusting mound of filth, and gave a short speech on the sanctity of trails, leave no trace principles, and accountability. They weren't leaving until someone owned this horrendous trail violation. After a few awkward moments of silence, Kyle shrugged his shoulders and sheepishly raised his hand. Baro sighed, shook his head, and gave Kyle his official trail name: Trail Pooper.Fast forward to last week...as I began my AT trek, Baro suggested I be named Fob W. Pot...Father Of Boy Who Pooped On Trail. My first hiking partner, Matt, loved it. He suggested I add Sir in front of it to make it more dignified...and because I was the oldest person he'd seen in 3 days. I discussed the name with several other thru hikers and they loved it and the story behind it.In addition to the great story, it connects me to family (Trail Pooper), to my AT hiking mentor (Baro), and to my first AT hiking partner, Matt. It's a name I earned by virtue of being partly responsible for the birth of Kyle, the Trail Pooper himself.And who knows? Maybe someday Kyle and Laci will have a son, an adventurer type, and all the hiking world will come to know him as Sob W. Pot.Fob","Neels Gap

In my first week on the trail in Georgia, I have experienced zombie-like stretches when all I thought about was food.Fortunately, as I awoke at the Walasi-Yi hostel on the morning of day 4, hunger was not going to be an issue. A friend and fellow sojourner, Maureen Welch, arrived with her family at 9am with a ton of McDonalds food and coffee! God bless her dear soul! There was enough for Matt and me and others to devour sausage and egg biscuits and cinnamon thingies. I enjoyed meeting her family. After sharing a few hiking stories, we prayed together, and I specifically thanked God for Maureen being a true trail angel early in my journey.Matt's legs were really bothering him, so he decided to take a zero and stay another night. Since the weather was nice and I was feeling good, I decided to head on out. As I left Neels Gap, I thought of my Uncle Phil who hiked the 40 miles from Amicalola Falls to Neels Gap as a 65-year-old about 15 years ago. (Mad respect for you, Uncle Phil!)It was another warm day and I was glad I had done a good bit of my training in Florida. Mid-afternoon, I descended into Tesnatee Gap and discovered more trail magic! King Tut and Angela were serving snacks and drinks, answering questions, and offering crochet winter hats courtesy of the Crochet Group from Bethlehem Georgia's United Methodist Church. I took one and now use it as my clothes bag cover, which is also my pillow. Thanks, ladies!The climb out of Tesnatee was the toughest to date, especially for my blistered right heel. I missed Matt, but enjoyed taking a few breaks and getting to know other hikers. First there was a guy from California who sold all his possessions and is traveling around the country in a van with his dog. (I thought, what kind of a nut job goes and does something like that?) Next were two ladies hiking together, one of whom lives near Tinker AFB, OK (our first AF assignment). At Blue Mountain Shelter, I met a medically retired Marine and his girlfriend. We shared stories of our time in Afghanistan. He was in the lead vehicle of a convoy in Helmand Province when an IED exploded, sending him and others flying through the air. His face was torn off and had to be reconstructed. Kudos to his docs, because his face looks really good. He doesn't have a trail name yet, but it would be alright with me if people called him Hero.After 10.5 miles, I called it quits atop Sheep Rock Top mountain. It was a good warm day of hiking. In fact, as I settled in for the night, I noticed salt formations from my profuse sweating had formed on my backpack straps.Fob","Neels Gap

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524116,"Day 5I woke up to a beautiful sunrise this morning. Before heading out, I spent a fair amount of time building moleskin patches for my blisters on both heels. I descended into Low Gap Shelter to get water and then spent this 12.1 mile day doing a series of small ups and downs.At the Blue Mountain summit, I spoke with a young, fast-hiking, red-bearded guy from Murfreesboro TN. He spent 22 years affiliated with the churches of Christ and then moved on to the Baptists and then another group. He said he was out here to find himself and figure things out. I hope he finds what he's looking for and can use this experience to re-connect with a God who loves him and is evident at every turn.The final climb of the day out of Unicoi Gap was intense. I try to take those fairly slowly and just keep putting one foot in front of the other. I also think of weird things to focus on. For example, I wondered what it would run me to have my friends Adam Key and Mickey Shrader do mold remediation on my body after the hike.Exhausted, I set up camp on Rocky Mountain, with wonderful views from 4017 feet. I fired up some chicken and rice on the MSR Pocket Rocket and gobbled it down way too quickly...a losing play in The Hunger Games. I called Lil Jan and was thrilled to hear her voice. Unfortunately, as she updated me on happenings back in the real world, I had to put her on speaker as my acid reflux kicked in and I started throwing up. It was like, ""Yes, dear"" (barf)...""that's good news"" (gag), etc. Sorry, honey! And sorry I missed out on those carbs! It wasn't the most romantic, mountain top phone conversation I'd ever had...but then again I guess it was.Fob","Sheep Rock Top Mountain

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524505,"""Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time.""   - Stephen WrightDay 6As I broke camp on Rocky Mountain, two hikers came by with their dog and stopped for a rest. The older bearded guy, Relic Hunter, was straight out of Deliverance...and I mean that as a compliment. He completed half a thru hike several years ago. While on the trail in Virginia, a bear grabbed a hold of his backpack which was leaning next to a tree by his tent. He got out, changed underwear, and followed the bear at a distance. It eventually dropped the foodless pack and moved on. Today the pack, with 3 bear claw punctures, hangs in his garage.The younger, thin guy, Loud Owl, looked pretty tired and worn out. I asked him where the trail name came from and he explained that ""owls can get pretty loud."" Fair enough. I reciprocated and told him about a time my offspring defiled a trail and that made him smile. I also learned that he was about out of food. So I gave him my relatively heavy bag of trail mix. His face lit up like a Christmas tree and he said, ""thanks, Fob."" It seemed like a good and decent thing to do, but I had some other motives: 1) I've learned out here that I never crave trail mix...especially the sweet, messy kind. I was just carrying it up and down mountains; and 2) Reducing weight whenever possible is always a good thing. It was a Win-Win for me and young Loud Owl.Later, I came across Driftwood who is hiking with her 20 year old special needs son, Wildwood. He doesn't speak, but can communicate with basic sign language. I spent some time with them at Neels Gap and observed how good and caring and patient she is with him. It was good to see them and I find them very inspirational. I really want to see them finish this hike.I descended Rocky Mountain and then began the long climb up Tray Mountain, the 7th tallest in Georgia. On the way up, I squeezed water out of a stream while a nearby brother and sister ginger team, straight from Hogwarts, washed their hair. It just never occurred to me to wash my hair in a Georgia stream in March. Next, I stopped for a break and met a French-speaking Canadian from Quebec with the trail name Diguidou!, which is slang for ""everything's good"".   Neither of us spoke the other's language, but I wanted to impress him and make him feel at home...so I said the only French words I know...""Oui, Oui, omelette du frommage"" which means, ""Yes, yes, cheese omelette."" He looked at me, understandably puzzled, and decided break time was over. I probably set U.S.-Canadian relations back by 20 years, and for that I'm truly sorry.At mile 60.9, I stopped and had a candy bar at Young Lick Knob which is followed by a dip at mile 62.2 called Swag of the Blue Ridge. I'm guessing the Native Americans who named these parts had a pretty wild party that night. At Addis Gap, I hung out with Castaway, a sailor who I met on the trail on Day 1. He's trying to make it to Virginia in the time he has off from work.After a final climb over Kelly Knob, I descended into Deep Gap Knob and set up camp near the shelter there. There were around 25 tents set up in the vicinity, and some lively dinner conversation around the picnic table. Most hikers were in their early to mid 20s, and the topic that evening was student loan debt and how to avoid paying it. Options ranged from ""just vote for Bernie Sanders"" to ""just don't pay it...education is not like a house they can foreclose on...once you have it you have it."" A ginger, with remarkably vibrant hair, suggested college was a complete waste of money. I had thoughts on these subjects, like one should only borrow money if one has the intent and ability to pay it off eventually. But I kept those thoughts to myself and instead focused on keeping my fettuccine Alfredo down. It wasn't the time and place for a lecture from an old conservative guy sitting on a log with salt formations in his Spanish Moss-looking beard.Later, I noticed 2 German guys sitting off by themselves so I went and talked to them about trail names and my time stationed at Spandahlem Air Base. Even later, I struck up a conversation with an impressive young man from Jackson, MS, who turned out to be The Beaver...the son of a friend of a friend who I had been asked to track down. I only wish Diguidou from Quebec had been there to see that I had tracked a beaver in the wilderness.Fob","Rocky Mountain

I packed up everything in the dark and departed at 6:45am while everyone else was still in their tents. I got a chance to use my headlamp for the first hour, and enjoyed hiking in the dark. Just gotta watch the steep ledges. About a half mile from the pickup point at Dicks Creek Gap, I went by a trail maintainer who was blowing leaves off the trail. I knew these folks removed trees and limbs, but it never occurred to me they used leaf blowers to keep the trail clear. I thanked him.I arrived at the Budget Inn and signed up for 2 nights, in order to get a full zero day on Saturday, give my heels some time to heal, and to hopefully get to church services on Sunday. It's not a race and I plan to enjoy these trail towns while I'm here. While waiting for my room to get ready, I met Pat and Meagan, a mother-daughter thru-hiking team from Vermont. Meagan graduated from Dartmouth, taught English for awhile, and is getting married in October.   It was her birthday, and we were all craving coffee, so I took them for some coffee and conversation at the nearby Dairy Queen. They filled me in on the Green and White mountains I'll face up north. Fun, random fact: the Asian guy who made our coffee was the first non-Caucasian person I had seen in a week.Once my room was ready, I took a long hot bath followed by a long hot shower, did some laundry, and then headed straight for Daniel's All-You-Can-Eat Steakhouse! It was so, so very good! I had a salad, bread, potatoes, fried chicken, fried fish, fried shrimp, pees, Mac n Cheese, baked beans, strawberry dessert, 2 waters, 2 diet cokes, a tall glass of chocolate milk, and a cup of coffee. Did I mention it was really good? Maybe I won't lose weight after all!As I walked back to the hotel, I re-supplied at a Dollar General and then headed back to the Budget Inn. Several 20-something hikers were gathered around a campfire next to the Inn drinking, smoking and sharing hiking war stories. I stopped by for a few minutes to chat, then headed off to bed...actually a sleeping bag on top of the bed. It was good to be in civilization.Fob","Deep Gap Shelter

They even extended the invitation for me to teach in their Sunday School class, so I taught on ""spiritual applications from hiking the AT.""Meanwhile, there was the issue of getting from church back to the trail...about a 20 mile journey. How would God come up with a ""lucky twist?"" Well, from out of nowhere I hear from Mark Crum, a high school (and Facebook) friend I haven't seen in 32 years. He said his family would be in the area and would love to take me to lunch and then deliver me back to the Trail. Cha-Ching! He has an adorable and extremely kind wife and 2 children....such a sweet family. They took me to Brothers at Willow Ranch where I feasted on the Chicken Alfredo and salad. Then, before dropping me back on the trail, they gave me a bag of assorted Girl Scout cookies! Thank you, Team Crum!I got on the trail at 2:20 and banged out 7.4 miles to Rich Cove Gap (elevation 3532 ft). The temperature was dropping quickly and my watches barometer was trending downward. As I pitched Big Agnes, the snow began to fall. Just after getting camp set up, eating, and crawling into my tent, the snow turned to freezing rain. Perfect timing, and luck had nothing to do with it.Sir Fob","Dicks Creek Gap

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524867,"""The cold never bothered me anyway.""    - Elsa, FrozenDay 10Elsa lied.I awoke at Rich Cove Gap to brutally cold temperatures...mid-20s with winds gusting at about 20-25 mph. The good news is that my Western Mountaineering Alpinlite 20 degree sleeping bag + Sea to Summit Thermo-Lite Liner form a cocoon that keeps me warm at night. The bad news is that if I'm ever going to make it to Maine, I have to be willing to depart the cocoon and take on the elements.After getting dressed inside my tent, I stepped out to find an inch of snow on the ground, howling winds, and freezing temps. Job 1 was to relieve myself in the snow by a nearby tree. (TMI Alert). I took my gloves off causing my cold hands to get the kind of cold where they start hurting. Trembling, I unzipped my fly and reached in. To my dismay, there was nothing there. Felt around...nothing. It seems the body part I was looking for had recessed into my body cavity and was lodged in a defensive position somewhere behind my gall bladder. I was not a happy camper. Shaking all over, I sang a couple of Mountain Dew ditties to coax him out...and then spelled ""AT 2016"" in the fresh coat of snow. Only I ran out before I got to 6, which left the impression of a 3rd Century hiker.I packed up camp as quickly as possible, knowing the best way to warm up is to hike. The snowy scenery was gorgeous, but I was focused on not falling, and trying to get the pain out of my hands by squeezing the trekking poles and wiggling my fingers. I was so focused, in fact, that I missed the iconic sign marking my crossing of the border into North Carolina. 1 down, 13 to go! As I climbed Bly Gap, the snow deepened and would run 1""-4"" deep for the next several hours. At the top of the Gap, I stopped, out of breath, hands hurting, wind blowing...and decided this was easily the low point of the first 10 days. I celebrated this low point by gobbling down brown sugar cinnamon sawdust (aka, a pop tart)...which instantly stuck to and dried out my mouth. I reached back for my water bottle and discovered it was frozen...thus creating an all-new low point. (Lesson learned: put at least 1 liter of water in the tent with you on cold nights. Just don't confuse it with the other bottle.)So with sawdust stuck to my tongue and cheeks and snot running unabated down over my mustache, I decided to...hike! You just keep walking. You suck it up and remind yourself that things will get better...and they did. By the time I reached Standing Indian Shelter, the sun had come out and my hands had warmed up. I met two Aussies while squeezing water. They live in a desert and had never seen or been in snow before that morning. Looking over at me, they also saw their first American snotstache.I continued hiking and passed Once a Day, who I had met a few days earlier. She is from The Netherlands. She fell several times on each of her first few days on the trail. A fellow hiker told her that if she must fall, she should try to do so only once a day...and the name stuck.The afternoon was slightly warmer and manageable...high 30s. After a fairly exhausting 13.7 mile day (longest so far), I pulled into the Beech Gap tenting area (mile 90.7). One thing I've learned about myself on the trail: If I interact with a lot of people during the day, I tend to like the solitude of a remote mountain top at night. However, if I've had minimal human contact during the day, then I kind of like being around others at night...at a tenting area or near a shelter.This would turn out to be an enjoyable night with several interesting hikers. Introductions...Maine Mike - older guy, from Maine (duh), told lots of interesting stories about hiking in Maine.Night Whisperer - so named because he talks in his sleep. From Connecticut. Handed out mini-Reece's peanut butter cups to arriving hikers. Built a great fire that night and the following morning!Bert - young guy from LA. Near-term goal is to get drunk in Franklin. Bummed a highly coveted (for smokers) cigarette off Maine Mike, and then another...behavior which eventually will earn him a trail name.Maia - pastry maker; 120 lb young woman carrying a 40+ lb pack...not good. From Colorado, now lives in Indiana. After the trail plans to move to Poland where her mom is from. Hadn't slept in 3 nights because of the cold. I lent her my sleeping bag liner for the night...no worries, I didn't come with it.Sir Fob W. Pot - older dude, reeks of manure. Misses his wife. Handed out Girl Scout cookies around the fire, courtesy of the Crum family. Big hit!After sharing war stories around the campfire, we retired around 9 p.m., aka hiker midnight. The bonding around the campfire drowned out the brutally cold morning we had all endured.BTW, here's the final Georgia AT tale of the tape:Toughest climb - out of Unicoi gap (due to slope, heat, and heel blisters)Toughest descent - off of Blood MountainFalls - 0Wildlife seen - 1 squirrel, 1 salamander, ~ dozen birds, including 2 owls, 0 bearsBMs in the Woods - 1 (@ newly named Quesalupa Gap)Weight gain/loss- UnknownFinally, a contest...by comment on this blog or on Facebook or on Trailjournals, guess when Fob will see his first bear.

You can't go for a jog and then call yourself a marathoner...or take a few courses and then put a ""PhD"" after your name. I'll be a thru-hiker when I reach Katahdin.""   - Sir FobDay 11I awoke refreshed, re-charged...and to a roaring campfire. (Thanks, Night Whisperer!). Albert Mountain notwithstanding, this had the potential to be a big mileage day. My heels felt much better and I wanted to get within striking distance of Franklin and a hot shower and meal.I ate a pop tart and half a Baby Ruth candy bar, turned on my AT Playlist, and motored out of camp. I played Leap Frog with Once a Day...not the actual game as that would have been awkward and inefficient...rather, we kept passing each other as we stopped for water, snack time, etc.As we approached Mooney Gap, I spotted a car, some chairs, and a table of food...yes, it was time for some Trail Magic, courtesy of The Wanderer! I had a Coke, a glazed donut and a hot dog with 2 Advil and mustard on it. Bert arrived shortly after me, and bummed 2 cigarettes off The Wanderer...gutsy move. As I sat there in pure hiker bliss, I told myself that somehow, somewhere, someday, I'm going to set up a magnificent trail magic stop along the AT and encourage others the way these stops have encouraged me. Little did I know I would shortly be burning every one of those calories to conquer Albert Mountain.Albert Mountain...where to begin? I measure difficult climbs by the number of times I have to stop, catch my breath, and wipe the dirt off my tongue. Albert...Big Al...Fat Albert...takes the prize, so far, as the toughest climb for me. It was also the first time I had to scramble, i.e., put the trekking poles up and climb hand over hand up and over boulders and things. I climbed to what I thought was the summit, only to find there was another section. After grinding up the second phase and thinking I was done, I looked up and saw a fire tower still another quarter mile ahead and straight up. Halfway through the vertical scramble, as I gasped for air, 2 young day-hikers with Fannie packs blew past me talking and laughing. I tried to trip the second one with my pole but wasn't quick enough. In another moment of exhaustion and moral weakness, I may have, under my breath, called them ""loser punk kids."" My reward for grinding it out was a magnificent view, although the top of the fire tower was locked.On the long descent off Albert, I paired up with Maia, the pastry chef from Indiana. Over the next hour, I learned more about the pastry business and kitchen drama than I ever thought possible. As she talked, I seriously considered changing my trail name to Creampuff or Strudel Steve. I also learned that Maia hasn't slept well and has way too heavy a pack...so she's wondering whether to continue. I tried to encourage her and we discussed ways to lower her pack weight.I stopped for the night at about mile 108.2, on the mountain between Wallace Gap and Winding Stair Gap. It had been a fun 17.5-mile day, my longest yet. And I had positioned myself for a short hike to Winding Stair Gap in the morning to catch a shuttle into Franklin.I zipped myself into my cocoon and put my earplugs in. Then, as I laid there alone on that mountain top, my thoughts turned to my wife...and warm pastries.Fob","Beech Gap Tenting Area

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525212,"Day 12I awoke highly motivated to get to Franklin, my next trail town. I broke camp and hiked 1.6 miles to Winding Stair Gap. As I approached the parking lot, there was a couple set up to provide some Trail Magic!!! Not just any magic, but piping hot breakfast burritos...courtesy of Jim and Beth! He is a former Special Forces soldier who worked at Joint Special Operations University...so we knew some of the same people and shared some stories. Really cool of them to be out on a chilly morning feeding hot food to hikers.A short time later the shuttle arrived, driven by the one and only Ron Haven. Talk about an interesting guy. He's been a professional wrestler. He promotes gun shows. He's run for County Commissioner. And he's well known to hikers for offering a free shuttle and owning a hiker friendly hotel and hostel in Franklin. On the drive in, he gave us an overview of Franklin and key points of interest. He made it clear that he offers the shuttle to one and all, regardless of whether you stay at his Budget Inn or hostel.I ended up getting a room at Ron's Budget Inn and began working the trail town checklist...hot shower...check. Laundry...check. Chopped sirloin steak wrapped in bacon + fries + salad + bread + 2 waters + 2 diet cokes at Normandie restaurant...check. Re-supply at Ingles...check. Outfitter to replace carabiner I gave Matt...check. Print $20 Smoky Mountains National Park permit...check. And then I spotted a t-shirt shop across the street and had an idea...I'll leave that one for you to figure out. I returned to the room to rest and get caught up on March Madness.Being a Wednesday afternoon, I researched options to attend Bible study that night. I found a Westside Church of Christ and called its contact number. John, the preacher, answered. He and his wife, Joan, were not only willing to pick me up, but insisted I let them treat me to the restaurant of my choice. Wow...just wow! God is so good. I chose a local Mexican place and devoured 5 scrumptious enchiladas and enjoyed chatting with then. We shared a lot about our respective families. One of their sons has written a Christian evidences book, Unraveling Evolution, which I plan to read. Another son has faced some challenges related to his prior military service and time in war zones. I plan to call him to tell him about his awesome parents and see how he's doing. After dinner, I enjoyed our Bible study...ironically, it was on benevolence. As John taught the class, I kept thinking here's a guy who, along with his wife, just practiced what he preaches. I'm thankful that, once again, God has put people in my path to encourage me.Verdict: A+ grade to Franklin, NC...this town loves and supports its hikers. And they would have one final parting gift the following morning...Fob","Near Winding Stair Gap

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525633,"Day 13I awoke ready to get back on the trail, but Franklin had a final parting gift for us hikers. A local church picked us up at 7:20 and took us to their church building for a full-up pancake and bacon breakfast! (On the bus, I met Cahootin, who earned that classic trail name because that's how he pronounces Katahdin. He also has earned the title of worst smelling hiker, amongst many worthwhile contenders, including myself.) The church serves this breakfast every morning during the 2 months or so of the main AT hiking season. On top of that, they took a picture of each of us to send with a note to a loved one of our choice. (I narrowed it down to Lil Jan and Jason Witten but Jan won out.) On top of that, one of the ministers shared a brief devotional message about God's love and the saving power of Jesus' blood. I love how this church uses their position along the AT to support and encourage hikers and share the Good News with them.They returned us to the Budget Inn where Ron Haven loaded us up and returned us back to the trail. Interestingly, several hikers stayed behind to take a zero because of the likelihood of strong thunderstorms/possible tornado conditions later that afternoon. The next several hours of hiking were especially beautiful in that there were more meadows and balds than usual. At Silers Bald I met Moose, a high school student from Clemson SC. As a former Dean of Students, I asked him why he wasn't in school and where his hall pass was. (Private school...took extra courses to finish 11th grade early...I bought it and didn't give him a demerit.) I also stopped to treat another right heel blister. At mile 119.9 I reached Wayah Bald and was rewarded with a cool stone tower and the best views of the day.After 11 miles I reached my target, Wayah Bald Shelter, and called it quits about an hour before the thunderstorms began. Thunderstorms are the main reason to stay in a shelter...added protection and not having to pack a wet tent the following morning. My first shelter experience was a doozy. I was joined inside by T-Rev, Squid, Stitch, and 3 Swiss hikers. The third Swiss dude fit by laying sideways along our feet. Several later arrivals, including a dog, tented in the thunderstorms which lasted off and on throughout the night. We all ate, laughed, shared stories, and even made a short Happy Anniversary video for Lil Jan.As I tried to sleep along a row of hikers, I kept thinking about all the shelter mice I had read about in AT books. Would they crawl over me? Would they get in my sleeping bag? To my knowledge that didn't happen. What did happen was my usual urgent need to pee at 3am...in a crowded shelter, with no bottle, and Mr Swiss family Robinson at my feet blocking my exit. I crawled out of my sleeping bag, flipped over, and did a crab walk over this young foreigner, here on a 6-month visa. As I passed over him, with my butt a mere 6"" from the tip of his nose, I kept thinking...keep the hips high and don't cut any (Swiss) cheese. In the morning I awoke with a clever collective trail name for these foreigners...ABBA! As I proudly shared it with them, the young lady responded, ""We are from Switzerland, not Sweden."" Switzerland... Sweden...whatever.Fob","Franklin, TN

My feet ached along with my left knee. To make matters worse, I switched my music to shuffle mode and Always and Forever came on...perhaps the worst song ever to listen to while hiking uphill. At the shelter a section hiking couple offered me a cup of coffee. Later, after the long climb out of Tellico Gap, I reached the Wesser Bald observation tower and was rewarded with arguably the most scenic, 360 degree view to date. As I made the long, wet descent, I came across my first...(drum roll)...snake! This black snake was just hanging out in a tree stump. I told him my name was Fob and took his picture.After a pretty grueling 15.5 miles, I arrived at A. Rufus Morgan Shelter and set up my tent downhill from there by a stream. Up at the shelter, T-Rev and The Hikers Formerly Known As ABBA were settling in for the night. A short time later, BooknBoot, the friendly Aussie who had slept in the bunk under me at Neels Gap, arrived and set up her tent. Later, Stitch arrived...she's a really cool former Army troop from Gainesville, GA (not FL) who laughs like Stitch...and does so each of the 10 times she's heard me tell the story behind my trail name.I built my first campfire of the trip and then retired to my tent to enjoy a heartwarming 28th Anniversary phone call with my wife.

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526482,"""The hero is commonly the simplest and obscurest of men.""    - Henry David ThoreauDay 15I broke camp and descended 1 mile to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC), a paradise for outdoorsmen. Across a sprawling campus with a river running through it, you'll find an outstanding outfitter, restaurant, general store, white water rafting, kayaking, and more. It's the kind of place that sucks you in and makes you want to stay awhile and raise a family and then retire.My first stop was to the Outfitter to pick up my first food mail drop...3 days of food I didn't need. Between Trail Magic food and eating less than expected on the trail, I way over-estimated food needs and wish I hadn't sent either of my two food mailings. I then headed to the restaurant to chow down on some Fontana Hash Browns...onions, peppers, broccoli and tomatoes sautéed and placed over home fries with 2 eggs and melted cheese...and several shakes of tobasco sauce. As I devoured it, along with four cups of coffee and five glasses of water, I watched kayakers practicing their craft in the raging rapids below. I thanked God for carrying me this far on the journey and for this moment of being warm, full, and dry.After a few rejuvenating hours at the NOC, I began the long...LONG...ascent up to Cheoah Bald. In fact, it's rated the 5th longest climb on the AT...3000 feet of elevation gain over 5.8 miles. It's not technically difficult...it just keeps going and going...like a hiker in the NOC restaurant bathroom after eating Fontana Hash Browns with tobasco sauce. On the way up, I came across Simba and Firecracker, aka the Weasleys of Hogwarts, the ginger brother and sister team with sparkling hair.At mile 140, near Grassy Gap, I found the Wade Sutton Memorial. On December 7, 1968, about 783 feet southwest of the memorial, Mr. Sutton of the North Carolina Forest Service ""gave his life suppressing a forest fire, that you might more fully enjoy your hike along this trail."" I stopped and paid my respect to this man and considered the horror he faced as he succumbed to a fire on that steep mountainside when I was two years old. He didn't become a hero that day...he was already one because he was willing to go into harms way to protect lives and natural resources. I also thought about my nephew, David Watts, and friend, Les Rydl...two men who have made similar commitments to fight fires and respond to emergencies and are heroes as well.After 7.7 uphill miles, I reached Sassafras Gap and tented behind the shelter. Around the campfire that night, I met some new friends including...Stone - his trail name comes from 2 sources. First, he hikes really fast downhill, like a rolling stone. Second, he's a Christian and loves Matthew 21:42, which reads, “Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: “ ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?” So the trail name reminds him of who he is and whose he is. He is from Roanoke, Virginia, and is hiking the AT as a missionary, supported by his church.Abbie - likes to rotate continuously around the campfire, but rejected my suggested trail name of Rotisserie.Amelie - hails from Birmingham and Hoover High...friend of Abbie...teaches 2nd grade...just out here for a week supporting Abbie's thru-hike attempt.The Hikers Formerly Known as ABBA - from Switzerland or Sweden or maybe Swaziland. Individually, I call them Swiss Miss, Fernando, and Dancing Queen.Moses - another Christian and fast hiker from Louisville Kentucky.Stitch - a really fun, friendly hiker and ex-Army gal from Gainesville, GA.Around the campfire, I learned that Wildwood, the 20-year-old special needs hiker, out here with his mom (Driftwood) injured his feet and had to get off the trail for X-rays and a couple days of rest. Also, Maia, my pastry chef friend, went to the NOC outfitter to get new shoes. The foot guy told her that her toes were infected and she needed to get off the trail for a couple of days. Please pray for Wildwood and Maia.It was a rough nights sleep because I mistakenly thought that tenting at an angle would be fine. As I crawled onto my sleeping pad, I slid to the bottom of my tent like a fat man on a greased slip and slide. I basically had to keep my tired legs extended throughout the night to avoid being in a fetal position at the bottom of my tent. Lesson learned.Fob","A. Rufus Morgan Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526483,"Day 16I awoke on Sunday morning, Easter Sunday, and realized how weird it was to be out in the wilderness on Easter Sunday. As I crawled out of my tent, I heard someone talking over at the shelter and went over to investigate. Turns out it was Stone, giving a thoughtful, encouraging sunrise message about God's love, Christ's sacrifice, and the meaning of the resurrection. Great stuff! He also reminded us all that what Christ did is a gift, a present, and each of us has the option of whether to open/accept the present or leave it wrapped and in the box. What have you done with Christ's gift?Today I would hit the toughest, short, non-scramble section of the Trail so far...Jacob's Ladder, at mile 151.7. Brutal! As I gasped for air and felt the burning in my calves, I did what any child of the 80s would do...I put on some Def Leppard and climbed the ladder! At the top, I looked back and told Jacob I was his new daddy.After 15.2 miles I tented near Cable Gap Shelter with Stone, Moses, Stitch, the Hikers Formerly Known as ABBA, and Terrible Lizard...who got that name when a salamander somehow managed to crawl down into her 2-liter Platypus bag.As I crawled into my tent, two thoughts came to mind: 1) I was less than 6 miles from the Fontana Lodge and all that would bring; and 2) I had unintentionally and creepily placed myself directly below the privy, giving myself an awkward view of the knees and ankles of hikers doing their business. I quickly zipped up the tent and put in my earplugs.FobP.S. Thank you to all who have made comments in my guest book. I read and appreciate all of them.

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526797,"Bubble - noun - ""a good or fortunate situation that is isolated from reality or unlikely to last.""Day 17I awoke, broke camp, and ate a granola bar dipped in peanut butter...another breakfast of champions. After climbing out of Cable and Black Gum Gaps, I began the long descent into Fontana Dam. Halfway through this 5.5 mile hike, Moses zoomed past me like I was standing still. (Moses was trail named by members of a church youth group as he sat in all his bearded glory atop Preaching Rock (mile 21.8). He's a Christian from Louisville KY who hikes fast and posts great AT thru-hike YouTube videos on the Phollowing Phil channel.) Initially troubled by the disparity in our hiking speeds, it occurred to me that in the wilderness, it's always best to let Moses lead. On the other hand, would following him result in 40 years of wandering on the AT? That's a lot of granola bars. Regardless, the plan was for Moses to get to Fontana Lodge first and book a room for me, Stitch, Robi Dobi (named after an elephant in her favorite children's book), and himself. He delivered as promised, as one would expect from a Moses.Fontana Dam is a great touristy place for families to vacation and for tired hikers to re-charge and re-supply. It's also a great place for hiking bubbles to take shape as you prepare to enter The Great Smoky Mountains. A hiking bubble is a group of hikers who will generally travel together over the course of several days, weeks, or in rare instances, even months. You may or may not actually hike near them during the day, but will camp with them near the same shelter or campsite at night. Being a part of a good, fun, mutually supportive bubble is, without a doubt, one of the very best things about hiking the AT. It's within those bubbles that friendships are forged, burdens are shared, and memories are made. With each successive shelter, campfire, or frigid morning shared, the bonds grow tighter. You tend to ride the bubble until your hiking pace, be it slower or faster, causes you to fall behind or get ahead. If you're fortunate enough, you'll eventually catch on with another bubble and ride it for awhile.At the Fontana Lodge, the first order of business was to pick up the second food package I had mailed to myself. It contained a 6-day supply of food...about double what I needed. (Lesson learned: no more food mailings.) I then took a long hot shower and ate fish n chips with Moses and Stitch. (To clarify, I was alone in the shower and together with them at the restaurant.) We then walked down a hill to do laundry and re-supply at the General Store. Later, we had dinner (Pasta Primavera!) and were joined by Patricia (trail name Mom) and Megan (trail name Orbit...because she has a big beautiful open-mouth smile like the girl in the Orbit gum commercial). This was the same mother/daughter team from Vermont that I had shared a cup of coffee with on Megan's birthday back in Hiawassee. As we enjoyed dinner and conversation, little did I know I was sitting in the nucleus of what would become my first incredible hiking bubble!","Cable Gap Shelter

When you walk into it, then you see it in a completely different way. You discover it in a much slower, more majestic sort of way."" - Bill BrysonFor the first time in my life, I awoke with a bearded Moses in the bed next to me. (Words last spoken by Zipporah several thousand years ago.) I got up and, in Macgyver-esque fashion, made oatmeal by heating water with the coffee pot. I then hitched a ride back to the trailhead where I hiked a couple of miles to and across the beautiful Fontana Dam. I immediately entered the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and walked along an asphalt road several hundred yards with Big Bird, a retired military officer who dispenses advice like the big yellow fellow on Sesame Street.I then re-entered the woods, placed my GSMNP permit in the hiker permit box, and began a 2700 foot climb over the next 10 miles. Despite the tough climb into the Smokies, it was a gorgeous, cool, sunny day...tailor made for hiking.At mile 170.8 I came face to face with the terrifying Shuckstack Fire Tower...the scariest thing I'd encountered since hearing at Fontana Lodge that our next President would likely be another Clinton or Trump. As my wife will tell you, I don't like heights. The older I get, the less I like them. I nearly wet myself watching The Walk, a movie about the guy who tight-rope walked across the World Trade Center towers. I don't like steep roller coasters and so I'm usually the guy designated to sit on a Six Flags bench, watch everyone's stuff, and eat a $9 corn dog. However, before starting my AT journey, I told myself I need to face my fears and do the fire towers...even Shuckstack.Years ago, my eldest son, Jason, preached a sermon that, to this day, has had a profound impact on me. Entitled ""20 Seconds of Courage,"" it's based on this line from the movie, We Bought a Zoo: ""You know, sometimes all you need is 20 seconds of insane courage. Just literally 20 seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I promise you, something great will come of it."" In the movie, the boy needed just 20 seconds of insane courage to express his feelings to a girl that he liked. Maybe you need it to jump out of an airplane, or go on a mission trip, or simply invite your neighbor to go to church with you. You don't need an hour of bravery...just 20 seconds.As I approached the base of the long set of stairs, I was digging deep to find my 20 seconds. I was also hoping for a miracle...a ""closed for repair"" sign...or maybe a sudden lightning strike...reasonable requests from a guy who had just slept next to Moses. No such luck...it was time to dig deep and face my fears. As I took my first step, I noticed the right rail was missing on the first set of 20 steps! Are you serious? How could North Carolina, a state which brought us the Biltmore Estate (not to mention Krispy Kreme doughnuts and the Venus Fly-Trap), not have the common decency to put another rail up on the Stairway to Fob's Death? Unbelievable!So with my palms sweating, my heart pounding, and my knees already weak from the climb into the Smokies, I took my first step onto Shuckstack and stopped six inches off the ground. That wasn't so bad. I then took my second and third and fourth steps and the fear began to slowly creep in. I hated it. And I hated myself for hating it. I gripped the left rail so tightly that a vein popped out of the back of my hand. If I was Jacob's (Ladder) daddy, then Shuckstack was his grandfather. With each step, the earth moved farther away, and I wondered why I wasn't sitting, watching the other hikers' backpacks, and eating a corn dog. At the top of the first set of stairs, I looked down and nearly pooped myself. I needed a new strategy. Rather than live in the moment, I decided to distract myself by making up new words to a church song...specifically the song, My God and I. Weird as it may seem, with each step, the song in my head went something like this...My God and I, we'll climb these stairs together;We'll walk and talk; look down and maybe puke.We'll grasp the rail, and wish there was another;My God and I, will climb to Shuckstack's view...That song, whether it was a God thing, simply a distraction, or both, got me to the top unscathed. For the rest of my life, that song will always remind me of the climb up Shuckstack. Unfortunately, the climb down Shuckstack was just as terrifying, and the only song I could think of was Free Fallin'! I eventually managed to make it down to solid ground, even though the rail on the final set of stairs had still not been replaced. I was relieved and maybe a little proud to have stared down one of my greatest fears..at least in this instance. But the Smokies weren't done with me yet...not by a long shot.At mile 174 I passed the side trail to Gregory's Bald and then the idyllic Doe Knob, two very special places to my friend, John Walsh. It was on or near Doe Knob that, years ago, John took a nap, and was awakened by a deer licking him. A true story...and quite plausible once you've seen the amount of hair on John's back. Ironically, and just as true...a few miles later, as I approached the stream at Ekaneetlee Gap, I spotted two deer in a clearing off to the left about 40 feet from the trail. As I tried to discreetly reach for my camera, one of my trekking poles dropped and the deer darted off into the deep woods. Bummer! I never had the chance to ask if one of them had once licked a guy named John.After a 12.6 mile day, I arrived at Mollies Ridge Shelter for what would easily be my favorite night on the AT so far. My previously introduced hiking bubble had picked up some familiar faces, like BooknBoot, the Aussie lady out here working on her dissertation who I first met as she bunked under me at the Neels Gap hostel. Additionally, our bubble expanded to include...Nesquick - single southerner, last name Quick, great massive beard, early 20s, great sense of humorDeadwood - married southerner, early 30s, also incredibly funny; thinks Fob looks like Robert Downey, Jr.Elle - 28-year-old engineer from the northeast; self-described ""adorable"" and she is; a trail diva with princess-like qualities; near-term goal is to be reunited with her boyfriend at Newfound GapConductor - previous AT thru-hiker; shares his considerable trail knowledge; earned his trail name by the graceful manner in which he swats at spider webs when entering shelters/roomsMaster Wayne - real name Bruce; section hiker; green hiking jacket makes him look like The GrinchI built a massive campfire and we sat around laughing and eating and telling stories and jokes. Really, really good times. Yes, it was just a bubble...""a good situation that is unlikely to last."" And yet it was our bubble and it was a good one and we were living in the moment.As I was about to doze off on the top level of the Mollies Ridge Shelter, Deadwood crawled into his sleeping bag in the spot next to me. He looked over and stared into my eyes and proclaimed, ""I'm sleeping next to Ironman. The fantasy I've had since I was 7 years old has finally come true!"" Everyone laughed.Ironman, aka Fob, finally dozed off to sleep...happy to have found a spot in the shelter...but even more so in the bubble.Fob","Fontana Lodge

Just write.""    - Melodie RamoneDay 19Today was a nostalgic day of hiking for me. I would be covering familiar ground, as a result of a 2011 Smokies section hike with my friend John, his brother Scott, and my eldest son, Jason. The morning of Day 19 was chilly and windy, considerably colder than the last time I was in these parts.Near privy-less Russell Field Shelter, I stopped to take care of some business behind a tree in the recently named Oats n Dark Chocolate Granola Gap...just across from Nature Valley. (For those keeping tabs, that was just the #2 tree-side #2 in 180.4 miles. Also, for those keeping tabs, no need to...I am doing it for you.)At mile 183, just south of Spence Field Shelter, a 2-mile stretch (to Thunderhead Mountain) constitutes what I consider to be the prettiest section of the first 250 miles of the AT...stunning views, sprawling grassy balds, birds chirping, interesting rock formations, etc. The only thing missing was Julie Andrews streaking across the landscape singing Climb Every Mountain. (I don't think ""streaking"" was the word I was looking for there. Try getting that visual out of your head now.) Anyway, I decided to stop, take my pack, boots and shirt off, lay down on a sun-baked grassy bald, and eat an entire package of sliced salami. If John, Scott, and Jason had been there, they'd have done the same.I continued the climb up to...(drum roll)...Rocky Top! Rocky Top, you'll always be, home sweet home to me, good ol' Rocky Top, Rocky Top, Tennessee! Go Vols! Okay, I got that out of my system. As I stood on top of Rocky Top, I had a flashback to 2011 when Jason and I stood on those same rocks. I learned from Elle that later that day, some Tennessee hillbillies were up there serving shots of moonshine and singing Rocky Top. That would have been something to witness. The only trail magic I got was a handful of tic tacs from some section hikers from Cincinnati.As I descended Thunderhead mountain, BooknBoot was on my tail and we started picking up speed. For no particular reason, we wanted to see how fast we could go. Like alpine skiers, representing the USA and Australia, we tore down the mountain, with rocks and roots serving as poles or gates to dodge and maneuver. Near the bottom, we stopped to catch our breath and get water. It was there that we had a really interesting conversation. First, she told me about her doctoral dissertation. It's based on the book Suttree by Cormac McCarthy (whose other works include Blood Meridian, All the Pretty Horses, and No Country for Old Men). She's hiking the AT, in part, to gain some perspective on the character Cornelius Suttree, who left a life of privilege with his prominent family to live near Knoxville in a dilapidated houseboat on the Tennessee River (probably next to the guys who were singing Rocky Top and giving out shots of moonshine earlier in the day). She spoke passionately about her research and made me want to read Suttree and her dissertation.She then mentioned my blog and said she had read several of the AT entries. She looked me in the eyes and said, ""Fob, you need to write a book. Seriously, your stories are quite good and funny and people will read it. Not everyone can be out here hiking the AT. Tell your story for them."" This sweet little Aussie, with a big brain, striped leggings, and a giant winter owl hat, couldn't have been more sincere. I found it all rather touching. So, I told her I would. Just like that, at a watering hole at the foot of Thunderhead Mountain, in the Great Smoky Mountains, I gave my word that I'd write a book about my AT story. So I will.After 12 miles, with the temperature continuing to drop, we arrived at Derrick Knob Shelter. One by one, members of The Great Smoky Mountain Bubble came rolling in...Master Wayne, Nesquick, Stitch, etc. The Smokies are conducive to hiking bubbles because stealth camping (tenting wherever you want) is prohibited in the park. You must sleep in a shelter if there is room in the shelter. If not, then you are allowed to tent near the shelter. Also, section hikers with shelter reservations are allowed to bump thru-hikers out of the shelter...because they have reservations and because most aspiring thru-hikers would prefer tenting anyways. All these rules left some hikers with a bad impression of the Smokies, but I understand the need for some rules given that it is the most visited national park in the United States.After eating some Mountain House Beef Stroganoff, gummy bears, 3 Advil, and a Little Debbie, I sat on the grass feeling tired, stiff, and cold. Then, from out of nowhere, I spoke 6 words that I had never said before: ""I want to do some yoga."" Before I had the chance to take it back, Patricia (Mom) offered to guide me through a yoga session. Next thing you know, I'm on my back, contorted like a pretzel, trying with all my might not to shoot beef stroganoff at the bear bags hanging nearby. After watching me struggle through the first exercise, Mom mercifully suggested we stop there and build on that progress in future sessions.That night, we packed ourselves into the shelter and hunkered down as the temperature dropped, wind gusted, and rain fell. Little did we know that for the next four days, at elevations from 4700 to 6700 feet, we would endure not only rain but some of the coldest temperatures any of us had ever camped in. If Spring had sprung, someone forgot to tell the Smokies.Sir Fob","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527572,"Day 20The cold, windy and rainy night carried over into a cold, windy, and rainy morning. I didn't sleep well because one of my shelter mates (whose trail name I won't mention but it sounds like one of the seven dwarfs) snored loudly and non-stop from 9 p.m. until 7 a.m. It sounded like a freight train had gotten off track and was loose in his nostrils. Had he been next to me, I would have shoved a hiking sock down his esophagus. Of course, I would have used one of Deadwood's socks in order to maintain my innocence. Deadwood would gladly take the fall for his beloved Ironman.We hiked about 6 miles in the nasty weather and sought refuge at the Silers Bald Shelter. It was so cold that Stitch decided to build a very rare, midday fire inside the shelter. As we huddled around the fire, we checked the weather radar. A line of heavy thunderstorms was closing in...perhaps about 30 minutes out. Decision time: stay at Silers Bald by the fire and call it a day...or make a run for Double Spring Gap Shelter, just 1.7 miles away? I took one more glance at the radar and said, ""I'm going for it!"" I then took off hiking/running as fast as I could, with a few others behind me. We got to the shelter just as the thunderstorm hit. We were cold, tired and a little bummed over the wimpy 7.4 mile day. We were also very thankful to have dodged a massive thunderstorm.Fob","Derrick Knob Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527573,"""I had come to realize that this whole place and experience is what you make of it. Your attitude and frame of mind determined everything. It wasn't hard to see how this undertaking could be the worst or best experience of a person's life."" - Kyle S. Rohrig, Lost on the Appalachian TrailDay 21We awoke to yet another very cold, rainy/foggy day. I heard a few grumblings that folks were already sick of the Smokies and just wanted to get through them. That was a shame because the Smokies are a beautiful, magical place. It's just hard to appreciate that when your hands and face hurt and visibility is only 30 feet.Elle, the late 20-something engineer who is part princess, part trail diva, and self-described ""adorable,"" was one of the first out of the shoot, and I was a few minutes behind her. Despite the crappie weather, I was looking forward to climbing Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the AT.Towards the end of a long ascent, in the vicinity of Mount Buckley, I spotted something in the woods out of the corner of my eye. It stood out because it was Aqua colored and only about 15 feet off the trail. As I got closer, I realized (to my horror) what it was. It was Princess Elle, embracing a thin tree, assuming the 90 degree position, and taking a dump! Yikes! Gracious sakes alive! Katy bar the door! I looked away, following the lead of a nearby squirrel, and hiked on. But the scene kept running through my mind, haunting me. First of all, I didn't even know princesses pooped. (Cinderella? No. Snow White? Absolutely not. Ariel, Princess Jasmine, and Sleeping Beauty? No, no, and no. Peach? Technically no, she only drops bananas from her Kart to slow down Bowser. Middleton? Unlikely, she's not the Duke of Earl. Fiona? Okay, I'll give you that one but she's an ogre.) And why so close to the trail, Elle...behind a small pooplar tree? Some things defy explanation.As I neared Clingmans Dome, there was a fork in the trail and I mis-read the poorly worded and positioned sign...and entirely missed the single white blaze down low and off to the left on a rock. Turns out half the hikers in our group would do the same and wrongly veer right, adding an unnecessary quarter mile round trip to the parking lot. We all agreed this fork could use one of those warning double blazes common elsewhere on the trail. Clingmans Dome is always impressive, but I'm glad I'd been there before on a day that wasn't cold and rainy with poor visibility. I walked around the top with BooknBoot and a friend who met her there. Eventually Princess Elle arrived, smiling, as if a heavy load had been lifted. As she talked on the phone with her dad, I interrupted and called her out for what she had done to that poor tree. She'll be getting the bill for my eventual therapy.With the ice having been broken in a most unfortunate way between Sir Fob and Princess Elle, we decided to hike together for the next few hours. I learned that Elle would be meeting her boyfriend at Newfound Gap in order to spend some time together in Gatlinburg. We brainstormed some April Fools jokes we could play on him, like having me arrive first to tell him she had met another guy and decided to stay at the last shelter. As the day wore on, Elle sensed that my 50-year-old body was starting to tire. So she began singing a series of Jack Black songs to motivate me. I wasn't familiar with any of them but appreciated her efforts. At the Road Prong Trail parking lot, we stopped with Master Wayne to rest and dry out our socks on a grassy slope.We eventually arrived at the popular, touristy Newfound Gap, a mountain pass dedicated by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1940. After so many days of solitude in the wilderness, it was odd seeing so many cars and people there. One person not there was Elle's boyfriend, but I defended him and assured her that he was probably in town making preparations.I have read many, many books by AT thru-hikers and several of them talk about the ""rock star"" treatment that aspiring thru-hikers get at points along the trail. I hadn't experienced any of that until Newfound Gap. As we organized our backpacks, dumped our trash, and ate a snack, several families and individuals approached us like you might approach a wild, smelly emu. ""That's a thru-hiker, dear,"" whispered one mother to her young daughter, as she held on to her to keep her from getting too close. ""Aspiring thru-hiker,"" I clarified. ""You don't earn the thru-hiker title until the final summit in Maine."" From a variety of young and older folks, we got the usual questions about where we began, how far we had gone, and whether we had seen any bears. I so wanted to answer, ""No, but I saw a princess poop in the woods this morning."" I showed restraint, not wanting to cause confusion for the young tourists and aspiring princesses listening and staring.Honestly, after hiking 207 miles, recently in the cold and rain, I appreciated the rock star treatment, even though I'm just a smelly hiker. It brought back memories of the last time I had felt that way. I was on a plane full of troops on our way to Afghanistan. We stopped to refuel at 1 a.m. at Bangor (Maine) International Airport. As we exited the plane and walked down the ramp for a 2-hour break, we saw rows of people lined up on both sides, 25 to 30 of them...clapping, shaking our hands, and patting us on the back. It was 1 a.m., most of them were elderly, and we hadn't even stepped foot into a combat zone. They handed us cell phones to use and had snacks and drinks set out for us. I felt like a rock star, even though I hadn't done anything yet. And I felt so very honored to be among these troops, some of whom had been on multiple deployments...perhaps a few of whom would be called on to give their last full measure of devotion on this deployment. I truly appreciated the kindness and appreciation of fellow Americans that night (you can read more about them at http://www.flybangor.com/troop-greeters )And I appreciated the kindness and interest shown on my hike by those at Newfound Gap. Memo to self: Do as much as you can, as often as you can, to make those around you feel like rock stars.I said farewell to Princess Elle whose boyfriend would arrive just after I left. I hiked uphill a few more miles and settled in at Icewater Spring Shelter along with the rest of the Great Smoky Mountains Bubble. It had been another cold, rainy 13.4 mile day...and yet a wonderful day.

In addition to our core Great Smoky Mountains Bubble, we were joined by...- John E. Just from Peoria, Illinois - he's out here attempting a thru-hike to draw attention to a rare genetic disease that he has. It's called Fabry disease and it affects 1 in 40,000 people, including 6 in his family. To stay alive, he has to get an IV transfusion every 2 weeks for life. And he's hiking the AT! After each transfusion, he begins working the logistics for the next one. (And here I am complaining about a sore knee.). He said, ""Fob, I hope my hike sends a message to people with this disease and others that you can still get out and do things and enjoy life. I want to raise awareness."" Message received loud and clear, Mr. Just...hike on!- Kole McKeown from Union, SC, where Janet's family is from- A couple and their young daughter who mistakenly thought that when they reserved the shelter, they would have it to themselves. The mom was not a happy camper when she realized their family getaway trip would be shared with a dozen stinking hikers. They brought a guitar and a telescope but no sleeping pads...all marks of section hikers.The weather was slightly better for today's hike. It was arguably the best day in the Smokies in terms of stunning, mountaintop views...Charlies Bunion, The Sawteeth, Bradleys View, Eagle Rocks, etc. At Copper Gap, mile 218.9, I stopped and reflected on having reached the 10% milestone. That seemed like an awfully low percentage for what I had been through.After 12.1 miles, I arrived at the Tri-Corner Knob Shelter (elevation 5897 feet) for another fun night with The Bubble. Deadwood and Nesquick began doing Monty Python movie impressions, and soon everyone was saying those phrases and using those accents around camp. As the wind picked up and temperature dropped, we all worked our way inside the 3-sided shelter to eat and share stories. Oddly, almost everyone had some form of potato, including the highly popular Ramen Bomb (Ramen noodles with potatoes). At one point the sweet, kind, mild-mannered Master Wayne stepped just outside the hand-hung tarp which comprised the shelter's 4th wall. He then ripped the loudest, bat cave-shaking fart I had heard since the one Daniel, my brother in law, launched during Christmas week of 2012. We all started laughing and applauding Master Wayne for his Master Piece, even while he remained outside to compose himself and assess the damage to his hiking pants. It was unclear why he felt the need to step outside, since we are in a hiking environment where such grand noises are not only allowed, but celebrated.Fob","Icewater Spring Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528097,"Day 23We awoke to yet another very cold morning. Despite my love for the Smokies, it was time for me to end this relationship and move on. I looked at my guidebook to see how far I'd have to hike to get to a hot shower. The answer was 18.4 miles, to the Standing Bear Farm Hostel. Game on!After an initial climb, I began a long descent down to Camel Gap. At mile 225.9, I passed the barely visible plane wreckage of an F-4 Phantom jet that crashed in 1984. To date, there have been 54 plane crashes within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. They are usually private planes flying in bad weather. The pilot becomes spatially disoriented, not knowing up from down, and hits the side of the mountain or trees.As I hiked that afternoon, the weather continued to improve, but I was growing weary. My feet ached and pain was shooting across the front of my left knee. At mile 236 I sat down on a log with Master Wayne. He was preparing to take a side trail and head home, as his section hike was over. Physically, I had bottomed out, but still had four miles to go to exit the park and get to the hostel. I wasn't in a good place. After a long break, with 2 hours of daylight remaining, I said a prayer, popped 3 Advil and stood up. I put my backpack back on and it felt like someone had added 2 bricks to it. I then slowly put one foot in front of the other and continued my descent, eventually walking under Interstate 40. After a tough, painful final mile, including some killer stairs, I staggered into Standing Bear Hostel just before sunset.Standing Bear Hostel is a really odd place. It's managed by Lumpy, a legitimate mountain man who's a mix between Swamp People, Duck Dynasty, and Deliverance. It's a wonder they aren't already filming a reality tv series based on Lumpy and this hostel. With a long beard and slow, drawn out speaking style, it almost seems like he's playing a movie character...but he's not. He's the real deal.After a brief tour of the place, Lumpy and I sat down on the porch of the old wooden bunkhouse for a chat. I learned that he got that nickname because he was a ""fat kid"". I told him I really liked his beard, and hoped that one day the mangy crop of Spanish moss on my chin would grow into something that impressive. He then proceeded to tell me a true story about his beard. Years ago, Lumpy agreed to let a local organization use his famous beard for a fund-raiser to raise money to pay the hospital bills of a sick child. The organizers used an auction format, and the highest bidder would get to decide whether to cut Lumpy's beard or preserve it. After several minutes of competitive bidding, a local businessman ultimately won out with a bid of $2800...and wanted the beard cut off. As Lumpy talked in his slow, Lumpy voice, I thought it was such a cool, heartwarming story of rural compassion. I loved how he willingly used one of his greatest assets, his beard, to help a sick child in need. But Lumpy wasn't through yet...not by a long shot. In fact, his tale was just getting started. He continued... ""They brung me and my beard over to the gal with the scissors who would do the cuttin'."" He paused for a moment and smiled. Then, in a higher octave, excited voice, he declared, ""and that gal had the biggest hooters I've ever seen!"" (He gestured just how large so I could get the magnitude and longitude.) I was speechless. We had reached the purpose for the story...the main take-a-way. It didn't end with a sick boy in a wheelchair being wheeled across the stage to hug and thank a teary-eyed Lumpy. Rather, it ended with a well-endowed country gal taking Lumpy's beard, but giving him a thrill in return.As for the hostel, your $20 gets you a bunk bed with a foam mattress and linens. There's a resupply store with reasonably priced, mostly not expired food (including pizza!) and other hiker amenities. There are laundry facilities...well, 2 tubs, a hose, a washboard, and soap to hand wash clothes, and a normal dryer. There's also the option to tent camp for a lesser rate, although at least 2 of the tent campers were drinking, smoking pot, and had taken 6 consecutive zero days in Gatlinburg to party, recover, and party some more. No thanks.I soon learned of 2 downsides to this place. First, the hot water was out, so my only option was an ice cold shower that took my breath and other things away. A hot shower, the very thing I had hiked a personal best 18.4 miles for, simply wasn't there at the finish line. Second, the port-a-john had not been emptied since Nixon was President, and was literally filled to the brim. Truly disgusting. Thankfully there was a privy by the camping area that could be used. (As I exited the next day, the new port-a-john was arriving.)After showering and doing old-school laundry, I ate a large supreme pizza, 2 cherry pie packets, a Gatorade, Diet Coke, Mountain Dew, and package of string cheese. I then shot a video clip, available on my Facebook page, of Lumpy and my hiking buds quoting Monty Python lines. Before going to bed, I weighed myself, and discovered that I had lost 31.6 lbs! I had reached my weight loss goal for the entire trip in just 23 days! It was a bit of a psychological boost to realize that I was no longer carrying around a ""frontpack"".As we laid there in our bunks and started to doze off, a rooster started crowing loudly. Lumpy yelled, ""Sorry y'all...the bird gits his nights n days confused sometimes."" It was the perfect way to close out a peculiar evening at a peculiar place. It will also be how we close each episode of the new reality tv show, ""Lumpy at Standing Bear.""Fob","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528312,"Day 24I awoke with the weird sensation of being in a bed...because I was! The first voice I heard was my tibial collateral ligament telling me we were taking the morning off. One thing I've learned out here is to listen to your body. You have to be able to hike with a certain amount of pain, but you also need downtime to rest your body and mind and regroup for the next section ahead. Over the long haul, I'm not going to be able to out-tough or out-ego the AT. It is far superior on the toughness scale. But as a 50-year-old, I may have a chance to beat it by making wise choices related to rest, nutrition, hydration, mileage, and weather. That's really my only chance.As I rolled out of bed, I also realized that we were out of the Smokies and the Great Smoky Mountains Bubble was about to burst. Some folks (Orbit, Mom, Stitch, and Deadwood) were departing that morning. I was departing mid-afternoon and still others (like NesQuick) were taking a Lumpy zero. On top of that, Princess Elle and BooknBoot had been sucked into the great Gatlinburg vortex, and Master Wayne was at home eating Cheetos and watching Netflix. Such is the nature of hiking bubbles...you love them, appreciate them, and ride them while you can. And if you're lucky, you'll cross paths with one or more of your friends again further down the trail. I also found it interesting that in 5 days in the Smokies, under tough conditions, I had learned more about these people than many of my casual acquaintances back in the real world. You can learn an awful lot about a person during a 5-hour, uninterrupted hike with him or her.I gave Lumpy a final fist pump, thanked him for his hospitality, and coveted his beard a final time. His parting words to me were, ""In case anyone hasn't told you lately, I'm proud of you."" While I suspect those are his parting words to all his customers, he sounded sincere and I appreciated them. In fact, I may have gotten a little lumpy in my throat.I got back on the trail about 2:30 p.m. After a 5 mile, 2500 foot climb, I was standing on the beautiful grassy bald of Snowbird Mountain. I looked up and saw a really interesting facility. It looked like a building one would enter in order to solve a puzzle and unlock a new world in the computer game Myst, one of the most popular PC games of the 1990s. I was tempted to enter, throw some switches, and be instantly transported to Katahdin. Unfortunately, it was just an FAA Control Tower, with a warning sign that if you mess with anything, people could die.After a 6.9 mile afternoon, I arrived at the Groundhog Creek Shelter and set up my tent nearby. As I cooked my 2.5 servings of New Orleans-style Rice with Shrimp and Ham, I became acquainted with a whole new cast of characters, including...- Lindsay and Patrice - 2 ladies who are making a movie about women thru-hikers entitled Thru. Be sure to check out the trailer at thruatdoc.com. I told them that if they changed their minds and decided to include a token man in the film, I would like the character Fob to be played by Bear Grylls.- Little Bear, Squirrel Nut, and two friends both named Tyler who made great fires.- Tree Hugger - a man who wears the same hiking shirt as me along with a kilt. He literally stops and hugs every tree with a white blaze on it, and says a short prayer asking that God will protect him and keep him on the right path. That's a lot of trees, folks...and a lot of prayers. I can only remember hugging one tree...a double blazer at Quesalupa Gap, but that's ground we've already covered.Fob","Standing Bear Farm Hostel

PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528315,"The reward of a thing well done is having done it. - Ralph Waldo EmersonDay 25I got an early start this morning and was thankful the pain in my left knee had subsided. As I began the descent into Brown Gap, I came across an old man with a white beard just wandering along the trail. He had no pack or gear and we were several miles from civilization. We exchanged hellos and he smiled and told me he was fine. I found it kind of odd but I hiked on.About 10 minutes later, I caught up with Lindsay and we discovered some Trail Magic! Yes, there was a case of cold Cokes along the side of the trail by a tree. I can't be certain but I believe the bearded man was a Trail Angel who had hiked way out into the wilderness carrying a case of cold sodas for me and my fellow hikers. I suspect he wasn't looking for praise, which explains why he had walked southward from the Cokes. His reward was intrinsic, because he knew that he had refreshed and encouraged some hikers. That might also explain the big smile he gave me as I passed by.The highlight of the day came at mile 253.9 when I summited Max Patch Bald. Several years ago, my family decided on a Christmas vacation in the mountains. I insisted we take a day trip to Max Patch, a place I had read about in various AT books. The family was reluctant to say the least, but I told them the view would be well worth the 30 or so minute trip to get there. It ended up taking an hour and a half to get there. When we arrived at the parking lot, the temperature had dropped to 20 degrees and the winds were gusting. Half of those in our group refused to get out of their cars. The other half begrudgingly followed me up the bald. With each step, the temperature dropped a degree and the wind picked up. At the summit we all were frozen to our core and looked like Jack Nicholson in the maze at the end of The Shining. We took a two second look at the view (which was spectacular!), and then rushed down the mountain to get in our cars to warm up. The family was not happy with me. I knew this because they told me so. I was the butt of jokes for the rest of the vacation and still get grief over Max Patch. So it was great to return on a somewhat warmer, low 40s, day and think about my sweet family.As I descended toward Lemon Gap, I entered a beautiful section featuring rolling hills, stream crossings, birds chirping, and mountain laurels. I remember thinking that the place looked like how I would imagine the Garden of Eden. Ironically, not even 5 minutes later, I came across my second AT snake! He was a little fellow, scurrying across the trail. Had he offered me an apple, I would have been really tempted to go for it.After a personal best tying 18.4 mile day, I stopped at a stealth camping site on a ledge by a stream. I was alone, but fortunately Rocky, a really cool section hiker, strolled by to snap a photo of me and the site. I dozed off to the sound of the stream, with visions of Hot Springs dancing in my head.Fob","Groundhog Creek Shelter

PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528842,"""Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, quality of the imagination, and vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life."" - Samuel UllmanDay 26I awoke, packed up, and began the 7.8 mile descent into Hot Springs. Or should I say, Hot Springs!!! A couple of miles out, I passed a rare Privy Tree that I named Deuce McLarty. They really should plant these about every 10 miles along the AT for hikers on the go.I arrived at the Hostel at Laughing Heart Lodge just after noon. Tie, the amazing caretaker, welcomed me and gave me a tour of the place. There is a nice lodge, perfect for romantic getaways...along with a hostel, perfect for hikers who just need a shower, bed, hot coffee, and some food. The first order of business was to get my mail. My wife, Lil Jan and sister, Ellen, had both sent me care packages! Among other things, I was blessed with homemade cookies with Hershey kisses on them (thanks, El!), beef jerky, gummy bears, cards, and notes. After reading Lil Jan's encouraging card, I kept hoping Survivor's Jeff Probst would pop his head in and tell me I had a special visit from a loved one. That didn't happen...but will soon.After showering, I walked a half mile to take care of the usual trail town business...doing laundry at the Wash Tub and resupplying food at Bluff Mountain Outfitter. Several hikers, including Stitch, Orbit, Mom, Moses, Deadwood (and his visiting parents) and me gathered at the Spring Creek Tavern for some food, fun, and story telling. Oddly, it felt like a family reunion. I devoured a giant cheeseburger with jalapeños and French fries, in an attempt to slow up my weight loss. I learned that Moses melted his insoles while drying them by a campfire, and that Jenga (who wasn't with us) earned that trail name after getting drunk in Franklin and toppling over. I also learned that, sadly, a sight-seeing helicopter had crashed in the Smokies on April 4th, killing all 5 people on board. What I didn't know, yet, is that Deadwood's parents would be bringing Trail Magic donuts to the hostel while I was in the shower! Well done, Mr. and Mrs. Deadwood!I was especially glad at dinner to sit next to Fisherman, aka Fernando, one of the Hikers Formerly Known as ABBA. He got delayed in Hot Springs waiting on a late-arriving hammock that he ordered...and plans to crush some big mileage days to catch his Swiss hiking partners. He confirmed for me what I had suspected...that Switzerland, Sweden, and Swaziland are, in fact, entirely different countries. He is a Swiss architect specializing in mountain chalets, and said he'd hook me and Lil Jan up in one next time we're in Gothenburg. I'm holding him to that. He also loves to fly fish and ties his own flies (thus the trail name), and plans to do some fly fishing along the AT. His favorite Swiss food is fondue and his favorite American food is steak...which costs $60 and up in Switzerland for 12 ounces. By the end of the night, he was my best Swiss friend ever.Day 27I had three priorities on my zero day in Hot Springs. First, I made several phone calls to the family to let them know I was alive and well. It was great to hear their voices and get caught up on family matters. Talking to my wife is like Ramen noodles with potatoes and Tabasco sauce for my soul. My dad continues to adjust to life without mom, and I'm proud of him. I also got to FaceTime with Mrs. Wilkinson's class back at Foundation Christian Academy (where I used to teach). They are one of two classes following my journey and doing various assignments related to it. It was fun to talk to them and answer their many questions.Second, I decided to invest $20 for a 1-hour soak in a hot spring-fed hot tub/whirlpool at the Hot Springs Resort. After walking there for my 3:00 appointment, I realized I had no swim trunks and none were available at the front desk. The lady told me, ""You won't need any swim trunks. You'll be alone and the tub has three sides to it, with the open side right on the river."" I looked at her and in my best Austin Powers voice said, ""Oh, behave!"" Based on her reaction, either I do bad impressions or she hasn't seen the movie.The attendant then led me to the river, turned the jets on, and handed me a towel. As I stripped down and lowered myself into the wondrous tub of healing waters, I got that feeling you get when you're naked in a hot tub in the woods. (If that's not on your bucket list, it should be.) As my bare behind submerged and then floated to the top, I wondered if the local Boy Scouts ever canoe down this river. (""Look away, Joey, that's not a rare albino manatee, that's Fob's behind!"")I decided to send a hot tub selfie to Lil Jan, but only from the shoulders up. In light of FCC Rule 438-09-b, Obscenity on Commercial Airwaves, and National Forest Service Pamphlet 10-8, Sexting from the AT, I had to be very careful what I sent. Even my chosen pose was arguably ""overly sexy"" and in violation of federal law.After my 1-hour relaxing soak, I got dressed and walked to the Smoky Mountain Diner for a large, supreme pizza, my third priority for the day. For the first time on my AT journey, I was unable to finish a meal. (An embarrassing shame for a long distance hiker.) As I returned to the hostel with half a pizza in a box, I saw two tired, weary young hikers descend from the mountain and approach the hostel like I had done the day prior. I asked if they wanted half a large, still warm supreme pizza. Their faces lit up and they said, ""Are you serious? Absolutely!"" Watching them close their eyes and gobble it down in under 3 minutes, it felt good to be on the giving end of trail magic for a change. In fact, as awesome as it was to get the two care packages, I felt an even deeper satisfaction watching those two guys smile and devour that pizza. Perhaps that's the kind of thing Jesus had in mind when he said, ""It's more blessed to give than to receive.""Fob","Stealth Campsite

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528997,"""Difficulty is the excuse history never accepts."" - Edward R. MurrowDay 28Refreshed and recharged, I crossed the French Broad River, hiked along it for a few hundred yards, and then climbed the mountain out of Hot Springs. At mile 278.5 I came across Dammed Pond, the first mountain pond on my journey. It was the kind of place where you'd want to get engaged, catch a fish, or spend a Sunday afternoon reading a book.At Tanyard Gap I passed Tree Hugger as he stopped to pray and hug a white-blazed tree. If he completes his thru-hike, he will have hugged 165,000 trees and offered 165,00 prayers in about a 6-month period. Let that sink in for a moment. A while later, I came across several miles of a controlled burn area on the west side of the trail. Controlled burns are a technique used in forest management to reduce fuel buildup (leaves, brush, dead trees, etc.) and decrease the likelihood of serious hotter fires. It also stimulates the germination of some desirable trees, thus renewing the forest. I was impressed to see hundreds of square miles of burned forest to the left of the trail, while the right side was untouched. I was also impressed with the placement and wording on several tombstones/memorials at scenic spots along the ridge.As the day progressed, the temperature dropped and light snow began to fall. At Allen Gap, near the conclusion of a 14.8 mile day, I headed .2 miles west on NC 208/TN 70 to get water under a bridge at Paint Creek. (That's just water under the bridge now.) I found a campsite nearby around 5:00 p.m. and checked the forecast. The snow had stopped but, here at lower elevation, rain was expected in 15 minutes. Three minutes later, as I was unpacking my backpack, the rain started to fall. Quickly setting up a tent in the rain, while keeping your gear as dry as possible, takes some practice and precision. The goal is to get your tent, gear, and self under the rain fly as soon as possible. I did fairly well but will become more proficient with practice. I sat there in my tent, feeling cold, wet, and alone...holding my food bag as a special invitation to bears to come get me. Fortunately, I had warm, dry clothes to put on and a warm sleeping bag to crawl into.Fob","Hostel at Laughing Heart Lodge, Hot Springs

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529000,"Day 29I awoke to a cold, wet, see your breath inside the tent kind of morning. Just a few hundred yards into my climb out of Allen Gap, I came across some...Trail Magic! Yes, the good people of Chuckey (Tennessee) United Methodist Church had placed a cooler of ice cold Gatorade along the trail which gave me a much needed morale and electrolyte boost. Less than a mile later...more Trail Magic! Someone had placed a pile of oranges on the trail. With the cold temperatures, I wasn't quite ready to take my gloves off and peel an orange, so I placed it in my front pants pocket. As I hiked, the single orange swayed back and forth, reminding me of what it must feel like for my youngest son, Kyle, to hike. (Inside family joke involving... ""imbalances"". Guess it's not so inside any more!)At around mile 296, I began a stretch of beautiful, scenic, rocky, and strenuous cliffs...specifically, Blackstack Cliffs and Big Firescald Knob. I took a quick break on Howard's Rock and read his story. (I invite you to do the same...see photo.) The section along Firescald involved a brief hand over hand scramble, the first since Albert Mountain.After celebrating the AT mile 300 milestone with a Snickers candy bar, I climbed over Big Butt Mountain. (I liked Big Butt, I cannot lie.) Shortly after, I met two section hikers from Alabama...Hiccup (who does so after eating trail mix), his unnamed friend (who works for NASA), and their dog, Blaze.As the afternoon progressed, the temperature dropped and there was light snow on the ground. To pass the time and keep my brain from freezing, I began brainstorming what the Pisgah in Pisgah National Forest stands for. I came up with...- Perhaps I Should Garner A Heater- Place I Should Generally Avoid, Honey- Peasants In Scotland Get Awful Hernias- Pastor In Skivvies? Gross! Avoid Him- People In Straight-jackets...Great AT HikersI welcome your own ""Pisgah"" acronyms.In addition to playing mind games like what Pisgah stands for, I also pondered other questions like:- Is there a Guiness World Record for ""Longest Running Nose""? (By that, I mean duration of drip, not size of probiscus.) Mine has been running virtually non-stop for 29 days.- Given the popularity of the movies/books Wild and A Walk in the Woods, what percentage increase (if any) will there be in attempted AT thru-hikes this year? Also, will the 20-25% success rate remain the same? (I predict a 15% increase in attempts and a similar success rate.)- Percentage-wise, how much of a successful AT thru-hike is physical and how much is mental? (For me, so far, 70% physical, 30% mental.) How much does that vary between hikers, and does it vary by month on the trail? (I'd say wide variance between hikers, with the physical % increasing with age. I'm guessing mental percentage increases during the middle third of the trail...then back to more physical for New Hampshire and Maine. We'll see.)After a long, cold 17.9 mile day, I arrived at the Flint Mountain Shelter with several other hikers. We built a huge campfire and gazed up at constellations in the clear night sky. Just before dozing off, I pulled the orange out of my pocket, pealed it, and ate it. Because nothing takes your mind off the cold better than sticky hands that reek of citrus.Fob","Allen Gap

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529347,"""We can't expect people to act like Jesus when they don't know him."" - Rachel Elizabeth JohnsonDay 30I awoke to yet another cold morning and decided I was about ready for Spring to kick in. I heard from a fellow hiker, who heard from a foot guy at an Outfitter, who probably heard from an African witch doctor, that it takes 300 miles of hiking for your ""hiking muscles"" to form, and 600 miles for your ""hiking tendons"" to do the same. Having just hiked 300 miles, I was anxious to see if I noticed any difference in my hiking stamina.After a few miles of downhill hiking, I saw a sign posted on a tree. It told hikers not to befriend or feed any dogs that they were about to see, and to even throw rocks at them if necessary. Apparently some dogs that lived there had followed some friendly hikers northward and never returned. It wasn't five minutes later, as I approached a foot bridge over a creek, that I saw a pack of dogs barking and charging toward me from a distance. I have been bitten twice by dogs in my life, while jogging in Prattville, Alabama and Swansea, Illinois. I wasn't about to be bitten again. Testing out my new 300-mile hiking muscles, I made an adrenaline-fueled 50-yard sprint for the footbridge, crossed over it, and spun around in a defensive position with hiking poles extended. My former colleagues at the National War College would have approved of this rarely used, single troop phalanx formation. As the sound of the pack of dogs drew near, the voice in my head said, ""Spartans, prepare for glory!"" The pack of six dogs arrived seconds later, barking ferociously at me from across the narrow creek. Their leader was a dirty poodle, flanked by a couple of schnauzers, an old hound dog with a limp, and two ugly mutts. I ran from these sorry misfits? Not a single Pitbull or German Shepherd or Doberman. I stood up, stared at my adversaries, and shouted, ""Shut your pie holes, you sorry bunch of losers,"" then turned and hiked on.I climbed 4541-foot Lick Rock with a guy named Orange Pacer. He got that name due to a tendency to mix in a little vodka with his orange Gatorade. It helps him ""set just the right pace"". I have no doubt. Later, I met 2 sweet ladies from North Carolina out on a section hike. They dream of hiking the AT someday and I told them to go for it. At Sams Gap, one of the ladies gave Orange Pacer and me her last two homemade chocolate chip cookies! Where there's a gap, there's often magic!As I climbed out of Sams Gap, I was feeling pretty good about my stamina and 300-mile leg muscles. Then, from out of nowhere a young, blond, highly attractive gal zoomed passed me with a weiner dog in tow. I don't mind being passed by a woman, especially one half my age wearing amazing, woman-smelling deodorant. But having a weiner dog with four 3-inch legs blow by you...totally demoralizing! If I had been carrying a bottle of mustard, I'd have squirted it down the length of his back as he went by. So much for having my trail legs.After a 14.9 mile day, I tented with about 15 others at Low Gap, mile 321.3. There was good and bad around the campfire that night. The good...I met Cambria who not only is from my birth state, Delaware, but was born in the same hospital at Dover Air Force Base! Since leaving Delaware at age 12, I've never met anyone from Delaware, much less from the same hospital where I was born. We shared a few stories and she brought me up to date on the football rivalry between Caesar Rodney and Dover High Schools and other important matters. It was great to meet her and talk to her.Not so good around the campfire...the pot smoking, which was accompanied by heavy cursing. Several in this group were dropping F-bombs like a common adjective, with the frequency that most people would use the word ""the"". Drug use and cursing are really not compatible with my Christian faith. I don't do it and I don't like being around it. I also find it incredible, and a bit sad, that in an environment like the AT, with amazing sights, sounds, and sensations in every direction, that that's not enough for some. They need additional artificial stimulation to enhance the experience, be cool, or perhaps escape something. I'm not judging them...God handles that and I need to worry about the planks in my own eyes. However, it's my belief that the empty space in their lives that they are trying to fill with drugs can only be filled by a relationship with Jesus Christ. Such a relationship would likely do wonders for their vocabulary as well. I didn't make a scene or go all ""campfire preacher"" on them. I did decline their offer of drugs, and retired early to my tent where I said a prayer for them.Like the rest of society, the AT has its good and bad. Fortunately, my experience to date, including interactions with other hikers, has been overwhelmingly positive. Positive interactions with attacking dogs...not so much.Fob","Flint Mountain Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529715,"Day 31I began this thankfully warmer day with a 1200-foot climb up to the incredible Big Bald, every bit as scenic as Max Patch. After taking a few photos, I descended toward Bald Mountain Shelter and felt nature's call. As I approached the shelter, I asked a fellow hiker if there was a privy. He told me no. Bummer. So, for the 3rd time on my AT journey, at mile 325.3, I found a nice secluded spot behind a tree on a hill to take care of business. Upon returning to the shelter, that same hiker said, ""Oh yeah, there is a privy...just found out. My bad."" Seriously?! Before departing, I renamed the area Mount Unnecessary 90 Degree Angle.Just after noon, I descended into Spivey Gap and discovered some...Trail Magic! Yes, Trail Angel Bob was serving drinks and goodies, and my Coke and Twinkie hit the spot. Thanks, Bob! A couple of hours later, I came to No Business Knob Shelter and visited with Poptart, SpongeBob, and GungaDan, who had stopped for the night. Poptart, a fellow Air Force retiree, was having the common hiker problem of too much food based on unnecessary or poorly timed food mailings. I ended up trading some of my tortillas and pepperoni to him for some of his excess electrolyte tablets and Gatorade mix. Lewis and Clark would have been proud of me.With my legs feeling good and a trail town just ahead, I decided to push on. After hiking a personal best 20.8 miles, I arrived in Erwin, Tennessee and took a shuttle over to the Super 8. This economy hotel beat out camping by the river or staying at a hostel, because rain was in the forecast and I wanted a hot bath. As I was doing laundry, I noticed a hiker box, where hikers leave items they don't want/need for others to have for free. In retrospect, I made one really good selection from the hiker box, and one really bad one. The good one was an unopened bag of Epsom salt, which I would use in three hot baths over the next 36 hours, much to the pleasure of my aching feet. The bad choice was the package of Bear Creek Country Kitchens Darn Good Chili Mix, 9.8 ounces, 8 servings. I'll come back to that later.After doing laundry, cleaning (back-flushing) my Sawyer Squeeze water filter, taking a shower and bath, and cleaning my cookware, I walked to Erwin's Huddle House restaurant, adjacent to a gas station. I feasted on a rib eye steak, 2 eggs, hash browns, bread, water, and Mountain Dew. It was marvelous! Not wanting to walk further to the grocery store in Crocs, I got the few crackers, energy bars, and Ibuprofen I needed at the gas station, then returned back to the hotel. I then called my wife and both sons to check in and get updated on their lives. It was great to hear their voices and know they are doing well. I dozed off for a Super 8 hours of sleep.","Low Gap

As a bit of a news junkie, I'm surprised I haven't missed daily dosages of news, and I certainly haven't missed politics and election coverage. I care about elections and world events, but hiking the AT consumes most of my physical and mental energy. Television wise, I've only missed watching some March Madness tournament games and watching Survivor with my wife while eating a big bowl of buttered popcorn. Oh, and I miss watching sappy Hallmark movies with Ken and Syndi Butler and saying ""see, I told you so"" when they invariably kiss at the end of the movie.

The first few miles featured several streams, springs, and footbridges surrounded by mountain laurels...really a pretty section. As I continued the climb, a 2700 foot elevation gain, I really felt the heat and the weight of my fully loaded, post-trail town backpack. Sweat poured off me and I was drinking a liter of water with electrolytes every 2 hours. Once again, I was glad that I had lived, trained, and ran in Florida for several years before my thru-hike attempt. That doesn't make it easy, but you learn how to deal with and adapt to the heat by being out in it a lot.At Beauty Spot Gap, mile 353.9, Tetris, Mumbles and I stopped for some...Trail Magic! Brother Tom, a Trail Angel, hooked us up with some coffee, lemonade, and snacks. Thanks, Brother Tom!After a 12.3 mile, mostly uphill day, I tented at the base of Unaka Mountain, along with two twenty-somethings...Tetris (former auditor for the Department of Education in New York) and Mumbles from Lexington, Kentucky. Given the exhausting day and and my belief that my pack was too heavy, I decided to eat the heaviest food item I had. After reviewing all of them, the winning contestant was the previously mentioned (Day 31) Bear Creek Country Kitchens Darn Good Chili Mix, taken from the hiker box at Erwin's Super 8. Weighing a whopping 9.8 ounces, and featuring three kinds of beans and a blend of spices, it seemed like a perfect choice.Folks, the devil is always in the details. Fine print matters. As a sat there on a log, at the base of Unaka Mountain, starving and licking my salty face, I read the instructions. I noticed that it called for 7 cups of water, a 6 ounce can of tomato paste, and a simmer time of 20-25 minutes. Realistically, none of that was going to happen. That is why it was in the hiker box. That is why, if I could live Day 33 over, I would have violated Leave No Trace principles and chucked the Darn Good Chili Mix into the forest for the ants and squirrels to deal with. But no, not Fob! I was going to be creative, to adapt, to take matters into my own hands. I intended to eat those 8 servings of chili on my own terms, following my own instructions. Translation: all 9.8 ounces of the Darn Good mix, only 2.5 cups of water, no tomato paste, and just 8 minutes of simmer time. For you cooks out there, including my brother-in-law Scott, warning sirens are now going off. I had no clue. I was a stupid, exhausted, hungry hiker. And I was about to create what Hispanics call Chile Bola De Fuego Nuclear...the highly toxic Nuclear Fireball Chili! My creation smelled terrific, but was thicker than a DQ Blizzard made with 10W-40 motor oil and the brown sugar cinnamon pop tart sawdust at the bottom of my food bag. You could set fence posts with this stuff. To make it just juicy enough to swallow, I added my final three packets of Tabasco sauce. If this were a movie, the scary music would be starting now.As I slowly ate, a process that took 40 minutes (about 5 minutes per serving), I ignored the warning signs, including a mountain-shaking belch after every third or fourth bite. I was a hungry long-distance hiker, this was my own recipe, and I was going to eat it. All of it. In retrospect, I was being Fobstinate. As Tetris looked on, that's exactly what I did. He remained silent, but had a concerned, ""Is he really going to eat all that?"" look on his face. A closer friend would have intervened.(TMI Alert: Sensitive readers should bail out now.)I finished off the last of the eight Darn Good servings, said good night, and crawled into my tent just after 9 p.m., hiker midnight. At 9:05, my stomach made the sound of a mother grizzly bear mourning the loss of her cubs. I rolled over onto my stomach on the appropriately named air mattress. My opening salvo was a burst of about nine trouser clouds, as if to announce the arrival of royalty. I heard giggles outside and laughed myself. Then came a 7-second long, high pitched squealer that sounded like someone letting air out of a ballon. I had become a human fart app! I could fart at will, but much more so when not willed.Moments later, the partially cooked, partially digested, Tabasco-coated beans in my large intestine began colliding at high speeds, like atomic nuclei. My bowel matter was fusing quicker than I could say Darn Good Chili, and the highly charged particles were converted to photon energy. In other words, I had inadvertently created a nuclear fusion-powered wind tunnel in my digestive track. If I hadn't donned my emergency travel Depends, escaping Darn Good beans would have been ricocheting all over the inside of my tent. By 10:30 p.m. when I stopped counting, I had farted more than 220 times. Not just any farts...Darn Good ones.As embarrassing as the noises were, that wasn't the real issue. Pungent doesn't begin to describe the smell in my tent. I was nesting in a Chernobyl I had created. Each time I raised my behind, I buried my nose further into my clothes bag. It didn't work. Do I suffocate in my clothes bag, or die from toxic fumes? What would they write in my obituary? I considered opening the tent's zipper to create a backdraft, but that could invite mosquitos, mice, and other creepy crawlies. (Although technically only the American cockroach could survive in such a toxic environment.) As the minutes passed and the salvos increased in frequency, intensity, and pungency, I became desperate. I didn't want my thru-hike attempt to end this way. And desperate times call for desperate measures. In times like these, I ask myself, ""What would Larry Alexander (my AT mentor) do?"" And that's when it came to me! I reached up with two hands, pulled both earplugs out of my ears, reversed them, and jammed them up my nostrils! Problem solved!

I had survived and had learned a valuable lesson.Powered by Darn Good Chili after shocks, I began the climb up the enchanting, extremely cool Unaka Mountain, which would turn in to my favorite forested summit hike of the first 400 miles. Half in Tennessee and half in North Carolina, it featured dense spruce and hemlock forests, grassy patches, and fog and mist. I kept expecting Frodo Baggins to emerge from behind a tree, on his way to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Near a campsite at the summit, around mile 355, I stopped to take care of AT Business #4...at the recently named Darn Good Patch.I descended Unaka Mountain and then began a series of ups and downs, including the picturesque Little Bald Knob. After a 13.9 mile day, I rolled into the Clyde Smith Shelter with Tetris, Mumbles, and Old School. After the noises coming from my tent last night, I was surprised Tetris and Mumbles let me stay in the shelter.Old School is a dentist from North Carolina who recently moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma. He began a thru-hike attempt last year, going from Harpers Ferry to Maine, and then heading southward from Harpers Ferry. Unfortunately, severe winter weather ended his bid, so he's back this year to finish his hike to Springer. He got the trail name Old School because most of his hiking gear is from the late 70s/early 80s. In fact, he said he went into some museum along the AT that showed a sampling of hiking gear by decade, and several of his items were in the 70s and 80s cases. Around the campfire, he not only answered questions about brushing and flossing, but a series of questions about what we should expect in New Hampshire and Maine.

PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530696,"""Regret for the things we did can be tempered by time; it is regret for the things we did not do that is inconsolable."" - Sydney J. HarrisDay 35I awoke and added a Little Debbie Oatmeal Cream Pie to my usual pop tart breakfast lineup, because today we would climb the massive, 6285 feet, highly popular Roan Mountain.Roan Mountain can be divided into two sections, divided by Carvers Gap. Hiking from the south, the first section features Roan High Knob Shelter (the highest backcountry shelter on the entire AT) and the peaks Roan High Bluff and Roan High Knob, which are blanketed by a dense spruce-fir forest. Tollhouse Gap lies between these two peaks and features the Rhododendron Gardens, the largest of its kind in the world. The climb up to the summit was long, hot, and taxing...and the climb down was covered in foot-jarring rocks. Aside from the amazing Tollhouse Gap, I preferred Unaka Mountain over this first section of Roan.As I descended the mountain towards Carvers Gap, I was tired, hungry, thirsty and my feet and left knee ached. It had been a beautiful, but rugged, several hours of hiking. I thought maybe...just maybe...there would be some magic at the Gap. And there was! Like angels sent from heaven, Haynes and Janice Miller from Bluff City and the Tri-County Church of God had set up a magnificent Trail Magic stop. Janice had been a life-long blood donor and that was an important part of her Christian faith and community service. Unfortunately, she suffered a stroke last Fall and her doctor told her she could no longer donate blood. He said she could find new ways to give her time and her money, so long as she didn't donate blood. After doing some research and thinking about needs in their community, it dawned on them that perhaps they could serve the AT community as Trail Angels. They did research on things hikers crave, and this was their first day as Trail Angels. They nailed it! Comfortable chairs for multiple hikers...check. A variety of ice cold sodas...check. Grilled hot dogs with buns, homemade chili and mustard...check. Asking if the hikers are ready for another hot dog...check. Homemade brownies...check. A variety of bags of chips and sweets (like Ding Dongs)...check. Hand sanitizer and napkins...check. Trash bag for hikers to unload their trash...check. Good conversation and knowledge/advice about the upcoming towns and section of trail...check. Sufficient cold water for hikers to drink and fill their bottles...check. It was pure bliss and entirely changed my attitude and disposition for the day. The only thing missing was Haynes offering to give me a foot bath and pedicure, but if you've seen my feet, you know that's a bridge too far.With a full belly and a smile on my face, I continued on toward the second section of Roan Mountain known as Grassy Ridge. It is the longest stretch (7 miles) of grassy bald in the Appalachian Mountains, featuring Round Bald, Jane Bald, and Grassy Ridge Bald. And guess what else it is? Our new champ! Yes, I would place this section as my favorite section of the AT so far, surpassing even the section north of Spence Field Shelter in the Smokies. If you want to take the family on a day hike of the AT, park at Carvers Gap, head AT north toward the Balds, and thank me later.On Grassy Ridge Bald I stopped and visited with day hikers Erik and Belle from Milwaukee along with their dogs, Bo and Gabe. We (the people, not the dogs) discussed my thru-hike attempt, and they suggested I pose for an ""REI photo"" on a rock ledge...so I did. I then took photos of them doing the same.As I descended the Balds, I hiked along with another hiker previously mentioned in a blog, but I'll protect his identity here. He asked if I had heard the rumor at Carvers Gap that a section hiker was bringing PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon) to the Overmountain Shelter that night, and whether I drank alcohol. I told him I had heard the rumor but didn't drink alcohol. He asked why not. I told him it was for a variety of reasons related to my faith, family history, and really just wanting to set a good example and have credibility with the many youth groups I've led over the past 2+ decades. I have many friends and family members who drink socially, I just think my life will be better off in the long run without alcohol and the baggage that often comes with it. In short, I don't need it. I get enough of a buzz hiking the AT, living in an RV, and being married to Lil Jan.He then asked how long I'd been a Christian (was baptized in frigid waters at Dover (DE) Church of Christ on Christmas morning, 1977...age 11) and whether I had been raised going to church (yes). He told me he had an interesting story to share with me about his faith, but would save that for tonight's campfire (he is a much faster hiker and was ready to accelerate). Sadly, that didn't happen, but perhaps I'll run into him again down the road so he can share his story with me.After a 15.6 mile day, I stopped at Overmountain Shelter, a true AT classic. The shelter is a converted barn with a stunning view, the best shelter view on the AT. The barn appeared in the 1989 movie, Winter People, starring Kurt Russell (a widower) and Kelly McGillis (the unwed mother he loves). The area also has historical significance, as it was traveled by the Overmountain Men, frontiersmen who took part in the Revolutionary War. They are best known for their role in the American victory at the Battle of Kings Mountain in 1780.I chose to sleep in the loft out of the wind, rather than down below to view the sunrise. Just when I thought there would only be a few of us up there, ten college students arrived, members of a recreation/hiking club from the University of Florida. I explained that I was a Tennessee Volunteer fan, an aspiring thru-hiker, and an Overmountain Man, and there would be no Gator chomps or Florida fight songs in the loft or by the campfire that night. They agreed.Between conquering Roan High Knob, hiking the stunning Balds, devouring the fantastic trail magic, conversing with hikers and angels, and sleeping at the famous Overmountain Shelter, I would say Day 35 was my all-around favorite day on the trail so far.Fob","Clyde Smith Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531168,"Day 36I awoke and quietly got ready in the loft as the University of Florida students snoozed nearby. On the other side of them was Lost Gear, an African-American, retired Marine who was doing a 3-day section hike with an eye toward a thru-hike with fellow Marines some day. He was out of water and didn't have a filter, so I hooked him up with some filtered water and enjoyed our brief conversation.I then climbed the incredibly scenic Little Hump and Hump Mountains. As I climbed, I started channeling my inner Secret Life of Walter Mitty. I imagined being Mitty (played by Ben Stiller) as he climbs the Himalayas in search of Sean O'Connell (played by Sean Penn), who is on a summit photographing a rare snow leopard. Halfway up Hump Mountain, I stopped for a selfie. I glanced at it and asked myself, ""When did you join the Taliban?""Later on, I met a hiker named Chopper who got that name from having to be medically airlifted to a hospital while hiking. They told him he had drank plenty of water, but not enough electrolytes. He was a huge proponent of putting electrolyte tablets in your drinking water while hiking, and I've been doing so ever since. At mile 390.1, Doll Flats, I left North Carolina for the last time on my AT journey.After a 9.2 mile day, I arrived at US 19E (Roan Mountain) and hiked .3 miles west to the Mountain Harbour Bed and Breakfast/Hiker Hostel. Upon arrival at the hostel, Hightop and his dog were kind enough to share their pizza with me. Sharing the hostel with us were Bevo (from Austin, Texas), Not a Bear (has a black backpack that sometimes other hikers mistake for a bear), Ptarmigan (named after a Colorado hiking club...and a bird), Morning Lori (from Maine), and Cactus (from Dallas). Cactus got that name by falling on a prickly pear cactus while hiking in the hill country of Texas. The cactus needles stuck into him all over his rear end and thighs. In severe pain, he dropped his shorts and underwear and bent over so that a friend/fellow hiker could pull out the imbedded cactus needles. Unbeknownst to Cactus, once all the needles were gone, the ""friend"" continued pulling out his butt hairs for several minutes, as others looked on smiling. That's just wrong.At the hostel parking lot I ran into Lost Gear, the Marine I had shared a loft with. He offered me a ride into town, where I picked up some groceries at Redi Mart and had a filling steak supper and peanut butter milkshake dessert across the street at Bob's Dairyland. Needing a ride back to the hostel, I approached a young local guy filling up his pickup truck with gas and asked him for a ride. He agreed but said he'd need to clear out a spot for me. We walked to the passenger side and the seat was filled with what appeared to be his life possessions...pictures, glasses, clothes, thermos, lampshade, etc. I helped him move the stuff to the bed of his truck with his other possessions, and felt bad that he was going to this trouble for me. During our 5-minute drive, I learned that he and his girlfriend had just had a fight and that she had kicked him out, along with his stuff. He said, ""it was all my fault,"" to which I thoughtlessly responded, ""probably so.""Fob","Overmountain Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531172,"""Dedicate some of your life to others. Your dedication will not be a sacrifice. It will be an exhilarating experience because it is intense effort applied toward a meaningful end."" - Thomas DooleyDay 37By far the best thing about the Mountain Harbour Hostel was the optional, $12, all you can eat breakfast buffet. That's about six times what I normally spend on breakfast, but I'd have to say it was the most satisfying breakfast I've eaten in my 50 years. Watching ravenous, hairy, rough-looking hikers walk up the stairs from the hostel to the up-scale B&B to line-up for breakfast was quite the sight. Like ornery 7th grade boys lined up outside the principal's office, we were anxious, fidgety, and drooling just a tad. We finally were allowed in where we devoured a simply magnificent breakfast. I ate and ate and ate some more, and drank at least 20 cups of orange juice, cran-Apple juice, and coffee.In my desire to attend worship services whenever I'm in a trail town on a Sunday, I did some Google-ing and eventually stumbled on a potential lead...Tom and Sandra Johnson from Roan Mountain, Tennessee and the Centerview Church of Christ of Elizabethton. I called them and explained my situation and they graciously agreed to pick me up at the hostel, take me to church, and then deliver me back to the trailhead. That's what you call a very sweet couple and a very successful phone call. My brothers and sisters in Christ were so kind to me. The services were uplifting and they invited me to the front of the line at their potluck luncheon! While Catholics are known for rosary beads and Jews for the menorah, members of the churches of Christ can do casseroles better than anyone! Romans 12:13 reads, ""Share with the Lord's people who are in need. Practice hospitality."" My heartfelt thanks to Tom and Sandra and the rest of this church family for your warm hospitality!I got back on the trail at 2:20 p.m. and was able to get in 8.8 miles of hiking. At mile 396 I passed a scenic wilderness cemetery and regretted no other hikers were nearby to tell my cemetery joke to...""Did you know none of the locals are buried in that cemetery? Yeah, it's because they're not dead yet."" At mile 398.5 I took a short blue blazed trail to get a picture of Jones Falls. At 399.2 I began a nice section along the Elk River, the longest riverside hike to date. I stopped for a moment and pulled my first ramp out of the ground, wiped the dirt off of it, and ate it. Ramps are delicious wild onions that can be eaten raw or cooked with Ramen noodles or pretty much anything. They trash your mouth out, but that's not really an issue out here. At mile 400 I stopped to take a picture of a mile 400 milestone that someone had left. On the one hand, 400 miles seems like a long way to hike. On the other hand, I've gone less than 19% of the AT, so there's a lot of work left to do.That night I decided to sleep in the Mountaineer Shelter, a rare 3-level shelter. I was joined in and around the shelter by Black Bear (from Maine), SpongeBob, Sunshine, and OutStanding. As I prepared to climb up to the second level, I noticed shelter graffiti which read, ""Brooks was here. So was Red."" Just for the record, so was Fob.Fob","US 19E, Roan Mountain

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531394,"Day 38I got an early start on our warmest day yet. As I crossed a footbridge near mile 404, I saw my first AT rabbit. He glanced at me and hopped away, not wanting to be spork-shanked, field dressed, and eaten by Sir Fob.At mile 406.7 I crossed U.S. Forest Service Road 293. Little did I know that just 24 hours later, hikers would be diverted down this road to avoid a forest fire in the area. I cleared this section of trail just in time.By late morning I caught up with SpongeBob and we hiked together for about an hour. He is a recently retired doctor from Hawaii out living his bucket list dream. He wants to transition from working with humans to working with animals as a biologist. A friend of his has a job that includes doing autopsies on dead whales to determine the cause of death. He's helped her with that and wants to do more of that kind of thing. At my request he also gave me a rundown on the pros and cons and touristy things to do at each of the major Hawaiian islands. Now I just have to figure out how to get the RV there.As I descended White Rocks Mountain I saw my third AT snake slithering across the trail. After a warm, muggy 16.3 mile day, I headed .3 miles west on Dennis Cove Road to the popular Kinkora Hostel, operated by the legendary Bob Peoples. As hostels go, it's pretty primitive. The suggested $5 donation gets you a bunk to sleep on, a hot shower, a shuttle to town, and access to a kitchen.What sets this hostel apart is Bob Peoples, one of the most interesting people I've met on my AT journey. In addition to running the hostel for the past 20 years, he is an avid trail maintainer who takes hikers (on their days off) and other groups out to repair sections of trail. He loves the AT like few others, and loves interacting and sharing his experiences with hikers. While eating a large pizza (thanks, Stitch!), I sat listening to him with my fellow hikers. Here is just a sampling of some of his tales...- The worst hiking injury he's seen is a woman who broke her femur so badly that it dislodged her artificial knee. Sounds really painful. She had to be airlifted out.- He explained how decisions are made regarding the building of shelters and privies. There are plants and animals that are considered endangered by one state (like North Carolina) but not another (like Tennessee). So at the top of a mountain shared by both states, that might affect where you place a shelter or privy. He also discussed the 2-foot long earthworms that live atop Roan Mountain.- He explained the detailed, 3-year, multi-agency process to re-route a new section of trail, and some of the requirements involved, like maximum slope. (The folks at Jacob's Ladder didn't get the memo!)- When you depart the Kinkora Hostel and get back on the AT northbound, you'll soon come to a Pond Mountain Wilderness sign. If you travel six more white blazes (at about mile 418.8), an unmarked trail will break off to your left (the river will be on your right). You can take that unmarked trail to a ""private, secluded swimming hole"" perfect for you and your honey. (Being honey-less, I didn't explore this side trail, but expect The Brimberry's to do so on their 2018 thru-hike and report back.)- Some privies have worms in the drop zone (my term, not his) to aid in the breakdown of solid matter. The reason hikers are asked to poop, but not pee, in said privies is because too much urine will drown the worms. I can't think of a worse way to die for a worm than by urine-drowning in a poop filled privy. I started to explain that when I do #2 in a privy, there's no way to stop #1 from happening, but that seemed like TMI at the time.- He explained how wood used to build shelters and footbridges is carried up and down mountains. In situations where it's necessary and feasible to use a 4 wheeler, they will do that build in the winter on snow, so as not to tear up the trail.- He cautioned us about the upcoming Laurel Falls, the biggest and best waterfall on the entire AT. It's important not to swim at the base of the falls, to the left as you look at them. Several have died doing so, including a father and son on July 4th, 2012. There is a whirlpool there that will submerge any and everything in its path for four to four and a half minutes. (Bob has tested it with a backpack.) They believe the dad went in to try to save his son, because dad was recovered with hiking socks on. Really tragic.- He met one hiker who was attempting a thru-hike despite stage-4 cancer and a prognosis that didn't look good. On his day off, the hiker volunteered to deliver a toilet seat to a privy that had just been built. On his way, he convinced several other hikers that he was taking the toilet seat with him on his thru-hike as a comfort item. Nice! (By the way, said hiker is not only still alive but said to be improving.)- He gave us updates on the forest fires that were burning, or had been burning, at locations both north and south of our present location.- He explained the back story on the closing of the Wautaga Lake Shelter (in 2014, 2015, and recently) due to aggressive bear activity. It seems a local hunter (and jerk) began placing food at the shelter to bait a bear. During hunting season, the hunter returned and killed the mother bear. However, her two male cubs survived and associated that shelter with food. Recently, some section hikers tented there and hung bear bags, but kept a few snacks in their tents and were harassed throughout the night by the bear brothers. So due to the actions of a thoughtless hunter, none of us get to camp on the portion of the AT that runs along Wautaga Lake.-His wife returned from a horse show several years ago and wasn't feeling well. She died from cancer just 9 months later. She was the love of his life. It taught him to do the things you want to do in life, because you can be gone just like that.- One time as a teenager in Alabama he and some friends went skinny-dipping at a stagnant pond near Squalid Hollow. As they lay there eating Moon Pies and sunning themselves in all their glory on the muddy bank, a shadow appeared from the woods on the opposite side of the pond. Just then, a hairy creature, about 7 feet tall but hunched over, emerged from the woods. It was, without a doubt, the legendary Sasquatch. It walked along the edge of the water as the boys gazed in amazement. It then stopped, turned its head toward them, grunted, and then headed off into the woods. Wait...my bad. That wasn't a Bob Peoples' story...I heard that one from Rex Dutton, a preacher friend of mine.- And finally, Bob told us a story about ""Hike Naked Day"" which occurs every year on the AT on the summer solstice, the first day of summer in the Northern Hemisphere. It's traditional to hike at least a portion of the day in the nude, although compliance varies. A few years ago a group of four young, male 20-something hikers were cruising along on Hike Naked Day wearing nothing but boots, their backpacks, and a bandana hanging from the front of their hip belt to at least partially Fobscure their junk. Their butts were exposed. Well it just so happens Hike Naked Day that year fell on the same weekend as one of the local town'sRhododendron Festival. This festival brings together hundreds of mostly geriatric women from around the country to celebrate Rhododendron (however one goes about doing that). Among the activities is a few mile hike on a Rhododendron-heavy section of the Appalachian Trail. You can see where this is going. Yes, reportedly there were several ""interactions"" between these nude hikers (and probably other naked hikers) and the sweet little old ladies who hadn't signed up for the Dangling Pear Festival. Word of these encounters caused the mayor, festival planners, and AT officials to worry that this could harm the festival and cause hard feelings toward the AT community. Those concerns turned out to be unfounded, as Rhododendron Festival attendance tripled the following year!After story time was over, I went to sleep upstairs at the hostel about 10:30 p.m. At midnight I woke up tossing and turning, with Bob Peoples' trail stories still stirring in my head. I turned on my headlamp and wrote a song, the previously blogged ""My Favorite Trail Things""...then turned off my headlamp and fell into a deep sleep.Fob","Mountaineer Shelter

PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531451,"""Then He said to them, 'Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.'"" - Matthew 4:19Day 39I slept in today because I had only 8.2 miles to hike to put me in striking distance of the rendezvous pick-up point with Lil Jan the following day. By the time I rolled out of bed, all but two of the other hikers were long gone.As I relaxed and ate breakfast, I got into an interesting discussion on religion with a fellow hiker taking a zero to rest his feet. Like a few of my fellow students, and more than a few hikers I've encountered, he's somewhat skeptical on matters of faith. He's big into science and looks more for scientific explanations for things, rather than a Creator-God. I told him I was a believer and that the things I'd seen on the trail had only strengthened my faith. I shared a story with him that I have found helpful on my faith journey. A man hikes way out into the woods, far from civilization, and stumbles upon the most magnificent, million dollar cabin he's ever seen. The perfectly manicured lawn and landscaping draw him closer and he discovers the cabin is unlocked. He steps inside to an immaculate interior with all the latest furnishings, expensive hand-crafted furniture, marble hot tub, computer-operated controls for heating and lighting, big screen TV with theater seating, state-of-the-art appliances, etc. He's never seen such an incredible place where clearly no expense has been spared. He steps outside, sees a man pass by, and inquires about the cabin. The man tells him there had been a massive explosion in the woods, a Big Bang, with wood and rock flying in every direction. The cabin, and everything in and around it, just happened to land that way...nothing but pure chance. It was a freak of nature and no one designed any of it. As crazy as that sounds, imagine a universe, or just a human body, or just an eyeball, that is infinitely more complex than that cabin. To me, the AT has simply presented more evidence that there is a Creator-God behind our magnificent universe. I think it actually takes a greater leap of faith to believe this universe all came about by chance. I enjoyed the discussion with my fellow hiker. There was no judging or condemning or name-calling. We were just two hikers processing all that we have seen out here, respectfully sharing some thoughts, and trying to work out our salvation with fear and trembling (Philippians 2:12). We each gave each other some things to think about.Just 1.3 miles into the day's hike, I descended upon the beautiful Laurel Falls, which lived up to its hype. I saw the dangerous whirlpool and a nearby plaque on a tree honoring Dwight and Dagan Cope, the father and son adventurers who died there. Rather than swim, I hiked a hundred yards or so downstream to try to catch a fish. Catching a fish while hiking the AT, without using a rod and reel, was on my AT bucket list. Using a spool of string, lead weight, hook, bobber, and tiny piece of Snickers, I tossed the hook out into some rapids that had water pooling at their base. No luck. After a couple more unsuccessful tosses, I switch to a tiny piece of Slim Jim for bait. Bam! On the first toss I landed a trout! I'm not gonna lie...I felt like a Hunter-Gatherer saving his tribe from starvation, despite the three days worth of food in my food bag. I let the fish go, saw AT snake #4 on some rocks near my backpack, and continued hiking.After climbing one final mountain in hot, humid conditions, I tented at a campsite with Gentle Ben from Idaho. I enjoyed talking to him, but I couldn't stop thinking about Lil Jan, my wife and best friend for the past 28 years. She was going to drive 3 hours in the morning to pick me up at the Shook Branch Recreation Area on Wautaga Lake. I was beyond excited. I was like a kid trying to go to sleep the night before Christmas, knowing he has been a (mostly) good boy and Santa was about to deliver the goods!Fob","Kinkora Hostel

Although it had only been 40 days in the wilderness, I missed her even more than I did while I was deployed to Afghanistan for nearly six months. I can't explain that, but maybe it's because there is more solitude on the trail, and I'm more in love with her today than I was in 2007.At the bottom of the hill, I discovered some... Trail Magic! Yes, some 2015 thru-hikers had left a cooler of ice-cold sodas and I helped myself to a 7-Up. After a whopping .4 mile hike that took all of 10 minutes, I sat down at a picnic table near the swimming area at the scenic Shook Branch Rec Area on Wautaga Lake. For the next 2.5 hours, I would feed crackers to ducks and geese and their offspring, inventory my food, and think about the arrival of my gorgeous wife!I've been thinking 'bout this all day longNever felt a feeling quite this strongI can't believe how much it turns me onJust to be your manAfter 2.5 hours which felt like 10, Lil Jan pulled up in our Lil Honda Fit! I was curious to see if she would be in a yellow springy dress like I had requested. (I have a thing for yellow springy dresses even though she tells me they are out of fashion.) Like an angel sent from heaven, she jumped out of the car, wearing a stunning yellow springy dress, and came running toward me faster than I've ever seen her run! Wow! Just wow!There's no hurryDon't you worryWe can take our timeCome a little closer Let's go overWhat I had in mindWe embraced and kissed and my heart just melted. One of the geese teared up. She looked sooooooo good! I felt bad that I was a stinky, nasty hiker who hadn't showered in days. If that bothered her, she didn't let on.Before heading to the lakeside cottage she had rented for 3 nights (3 nights!), we went into Hampton to grab lunch and then to a small country grocery store. She was getting our food for the cottage and I was re-stocking my trail food. As she perused the food options from aisle to aisle, I couldn't take my eyes off of her. I was stalking her without her knowing it. She looked so good. Someone once said, ""Life is not measured by the number of breaths you take, but by the moments that take your breath away."" I had four such moments just watching her check the expiration dates on sandwich meat an aisle over. Her yellow dress was the brightest thing in the store, maybe even the town, and I was the luckiest man alive.As we drove toward the cottage, we stopped by our pickup point and gave ice cream sandwiches to Brief Thief and another hiker....I think it was Bevo. The 30 minute drive seemed to take 3 hours. I was torn between wanting her to drive safely on the curvy mountain roads and wanting her to go all Crazy Taxi. We finally arrived to an adorable cottage overlooking Wautaga Lake. It had everything we needed, including a secluded hot tub with a view of the lake. I had planned to pick her up and carry her across the threshold, but was too exhausted after lugging her 90 pound suitcase up the stairs. Once inside, my mind raced as I processed so many competing priorities...close the sliding door I had just opened, put the ice cream in the freezer, take a hot shower, drink a quart of milk, get caught up on family news...Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low Put some music on that's soft and slowBaby we ain't got no place to goI hope you understandI've been thinking 'bout this all day long (40 days actually)Never felt a feeling quite this strongI can't believe how much it turns me onJust to be your manThe next 3 days would be the most relaxing and satisfying I've ever had. Lil Jan fed me all of my special food requests, pampered me, massaged me (even my feet!), and stretched me. The hot tub was piping hot and quite refreshing for my aching body. As for the conversation, it was exhilarating and breathtaking (even for a long distance hiker). She brought me up on family news like never before.Ain't nobody ever love nobodyThe way that I love youWe're alone nowYou don't know howLong I've wanted toLock the door and turn the lights down low Put some music on that's soft and slowBaby we ain't got no place to goI hope you understandI am so richly blessed being married to Lil Jan. She has encouraged me so many times in so many ways in the 3+ decades I've known her. The three magical days and nights on Wautaga Lake are just the latest example. She is a wonderful Christian mom who raised two outstanding young men. She is the kind of friend that everyone deserves to have at least one of in their lifetime. She is a nurturer, a giver, and a leader. She is sexy, funny, and a talented singer and speaker. I learned recently she is even comfortable handling weapons at a firing range! Who knew? She is the only person on the planet I could live in a 32' house on wheels with and never grow tired of it. It's a cliché, but without a doubt she makes me want to be a better man. She dazzled me the first time I met her and has only grown more beautiful through the years. If you are wondering whether 6 months on the AT can hurt a relationship, I say ""not this one"". We're in it for the long haul...til death do us part. So just how does it feel to be her man?

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532278,"""A good character is the best tombstone. Those who loved you and were helped by you will remember you when forget-me-nots have withered. Carve your name on hearts, not on marble."" - Charles H. Spurgeon (1834-1892), English PreacherDay 43Sadly, my reunion with Lil Jan had come to an end, and she drove me back to the Shook Branch Recreation Area. Her parents (MawMaw and Papa) and sister and brother-in-law (Carol and Scott) were in the area visiting Janet's other sister and decided to stop by and hug my neck. It was great to see them if only for a few minutes. After saying our goodbyes, and giving Lil Jan a final kiss, they departed.One thing that will help take the sting out of saying goodbye is a bit of...Trail Magic! Yes, right there at the Rec Area a group of 2015 thru-hikers had reunited from different parts of the country to set up a magnificent cookout. I knew it would be special because those who have hiked the trail know just how to serve up some magic. Among many possible options, I went with a bacon cheeseburger, chips, soda, and dessert. I sat there for 30 minutes picking their brains about their experiences and what to expect as I head northward. So, I want to give a big shout out to Rock Boat, Forward, Jeopardy, Doc, Klank, and Poboy for the conversation and the magic. (I would learn later that Forward is friends with Karen King, a church friend from our Virginia days.)One of the last things said to me by Rock Boat was, ""There were lots of good and bad things that happened on the trail, but I only remember the good stuff."" His comment gave me something to think about as I headed out for the beautiful, several mile long hike along Wautaga Lake. Did he actually forget the bad stuff that happened on his thru-hike? Or, was the bad stuff, in the context of the overall hike, eventually considered to be part of the good stuff? For example, was the hike through a thunderstorm (considered ""bad"" at the time) ultimately considered part of the ""good"" because he had overcome it, survived, and developed a closer bond with other survivors as a result? In James 1:2-4, James writes, ""Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything."" I'm trying to take these verses to heart and really apply them out here. I'm trying to find joy in the thunderstorm, the foot/toe numbness, the homesickness, and other trail trials, knowing that God will somehow use them to make me a more mature and complete person and Christian. Overcoming some ""bad"" stuff has already increased my trail perseverance, resolve, and ""bad"" tolerance levels, and a goal is to have that translate back in the real world. I want to more consistently find joy in the seemingly good and bad, and know that God will use both to mold me into the man he wants me to be. I also want to have a much higher percentage of bad stuff...daily annoyances, perceived slights, inconveniences, traffic jams, cold showers, etc...be small stuff that I don't sweat.As I hiked along the lake, I passed the Wautaga Lake Shelter that has been closed due to bear activity. I also passed a 1/2 mile long section of the trail which had burned in the recent forest fire (arson suspected). Later, a group from the Centerview Church of Christ, where I had worshipped the preceding Sunday, passed me from the other direction. It was great to see David Irick, one of their ministers, and other familiar faces, out on a day hike. We spoke for a few moments and David was kind enough to give me my first Yoo-hoo chocolate drink. Later, near Wilbur Dam Road, I enjoyed one final parting gift from the Centerview congregation...a cooler full of Throwback Mountain Dew!After a fairly easy 9.1 mile day, I stayed at the Vandeventer Shelter with a gorgeous view behind it. The shelter and surrounding tent sites were full that night, with a cast of characters including 5-Star, Odysseus, and NesQuick (my hiking buddy from the Great Smoky Mountains Bubble). There was also a rather odd fellow (section hiker) who said he and his fiancé had been robbed of their food and money while getting water at a shelter a few days prior. Then they had a big fight and were now hiking in opposite directions, even though they were ""on their way to Texas."" I wondered if he knew the AT doesn't go through Texas. He had no food, no stove, his phone was dead, and he never got out of his sleeping bag. This all seemed rather bizarre to me. Although he didn't ask for any help, the aspiring thru-hikers passed around a large ziplock bag at campfire that night and filled it with snacks for him. That night, I did my best to find joy in the loud snoring of the hiker right next to me in the shelter. Maybe his snoring kept the mice away.Fob","Shook Branch Rec Area

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532472,"Day 44I awoke and immediately had two things working in my favor: an early start (6:50 a.m., to get away from Sir Snores-a-Lot) and a relatively flat topography ahead. This had the potential to be a big mileage day, although that's rarely my goal.At mile 444 I passed the Uncle Nick Grindstaff Monument. According to his tombstone, he was born December 26, 1851 and died July 22, 1953. He lived as a hermit on Iron Mountain the last 40 years of his life, and his tombstone reads, ""He lived alone, suffered alone, and died alone."" For more on his life and story, check out... http://appalachiantreks.blogspot.com/2012/07/uncle-nick-grindstaff.html?m=1As I descended Iron Mountain, I looked down at my sweaty right forearm and noticed my first AT tick walking along it. I brushed him off and spent the next mile running my fingers through my hair and checking various body crevices. I fear ticks and the diseases they carry more than I fear snakes and bears combined. (Although a combined Snake-Bear would be fairly intimidating.)At mile 447.3 I began a peaceful, scenic walk through a pasture. Out here on the AT, I love how God can just flip a switch and send us from mountains to pastures, from wind to stillness, and from shady laurel valleys to sunny ridges in mere moments. If you don't like the scenery, keep hiking and wait a few minutes. Halfway across the pasture I stopped and visited with Mountain Man, a rare southbound hiker. We exchanged trail notes and our beards posed for a selfie together. Later, I came across a metal cage full of...Trail Magic! I had a soda and a snack, courtesy of the Girls in Action, a 4th-6th Grade mission group from the Nelson Chapel Baptist Church, Mountain City, Tennessee. I hope my fellow hikers and I don't just see and appreciate the magic, and the Trail Angels, but also the faith in Christ and desire to live like Him that motivates much of it. In other words, I hope they receive not just the Mountain Dew, but ultimately the Gospel Message that can really change their lives, and mine.As I descended Locust Knob, I met a couple from Johnson City out on a day hike. They have hiked local AT sections and other area trails for the past decade and have set up numerous off-trail secret campsites behind rock formations and other barriers for their own use. He asked if I noticed the two mating butterflies floating around about 30 yards south. I told him I had, but wasn't sure if they were mating or just holding hands. He asked, ""Did you notice they were two different species? That's just wrong."" I suggested maybe a third species would result, but that didn't satisfy him. He also told me the green plant I had been seeing in abundance all day long was a May Apple.After a 20.2 mile day, I stealth camped near a spring at mile 456.1. A short time later, NesQuick (who is having serious foot issues) and Dawn (aka Slim Rim, from Vermont) joined me and tented nearby. As we ate supper (for me, that meant Mountain House Pasta Primavera with 2 Parmesan cheese packets), she asked about my family and I bragged on my sons for a few minutes. She replied, ""That's really cool. I hope my dad talks that way about me when I'm not around."" I hope he does too.Fob","Vandeventer Shelter

A few miles into the day's hike, I saw AT snake #5, a little guy slithering across the trail. At mile 465.1 I crossed the border into Virginia, the 4th of 14 states on the Appalachian Trail. I'll be in Virginia for over 500 miles...over one fourth of the AT.After a 12.9 mile day, I entered Damascus, Trail Town America, with NesQuick, Buckles, and Dirty Deed just behind me. We celebrated our arrival at arguably the best trail town on the AT by posing at the town welcome sign. After putting our shirts on, our first stop was Pizza Plus, where I ate a medium meat lovers pizza and a salad and drank 8 glasses of Mountain Dew. My eyes would remain wide open for the next 12 hours.Among many good town lodging options, NesQuick and I shared a room at Dave's Place, a cheap, basic hostel associated with the Mount Rogers Outfitter. After a hot shower, I crossed the street to spend some time with the foot guy at the Outfitter. I explained my foot pain and showed him the blisters on the edge of my feet. He listened and examined my feet, boots, socks, liners, and insoles in detail. He said my boots (Oboz Sawtooth Mids) were excellent choices, still fit well, and had plenty of tread on them. The socks and liners were also fine, but he recommended I rotate them with my other set about mid-day, and hang the sweaty ones on the back of my pack to dry. The issue was my insoles. They were too soft/squishy and had flattened out which can happen after 468.5 miles. He recommended I try Superfeet Green Premium Insoles. I did and I felt an immediate improvement! In fact, I jumped up and down in the store with no pain, and came awkwardly close to hugging the foot guy. Count me among the Superfeet fans. I wish I had started with them.NesQuick and I re-supplied at the Dollar General. Then he, Conductor, several other hikers and I went to Bobo McFarland's where I feasted on some fish and chips.

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533117,"""Long friendships are like jewels, polished over time to become beautiful and enduring."" - Celia BrayfieldDay 46Let me tell you about my dear friend, Jeff Battreall. When I arrived at McGuire AFB, New Jersey in 1981 (Christmas week of my 10th grade year) Jeff was one of the first people I met. He was a few years older, but we formed an instant bond. Our dads were both colonels and he lived a few houses down from me on Orly Place (Colonels Row). He was incredibly funny, witty, and sarcastic, and he had a license and really nice Ford Mustang. We shared a similar taste in music and sports (including neighborhood dunk contests on a 9' rim), and dated the same girl (at different times). He has a larger than life personality and an infectious positive spirit. We would spend hours driving around, sometimes with our ladies, listening to and singing loudly with Queen, Duran Duran, Prince, Styx and the Little River Band. We've had extended arguments over who sounds better singing Styx' Mr. Roboto and the meaning of Prince's Little Red Corvette. More than anyone else, Jeff made my high school years fun. Beyond the fun, he is a loyal friend and we have remained in contact for the past three decades. He has even visited on a few occasions, including my Air Force retirement ceremony at MacDill AFB, Florida in 2011. I don't know of a civilian who loves and appreciates the military more than Jeff. It was no surprise when Jeff heard that I was hiking the AT, and said he wanted to meet me in Damascus and hang out.Before his noon arrival, I had two priorities to attend to. First, I went to a hostel down the street to do laundry. Second, I Face-Timed with Mr. Terry Reeve's 6th grade class at Foundation Christian Academy. They are one of two classes following my AT journey and completing some related assignments. I enjoyed talking with them and answering their questions, half of which related to bears and going to the bathroom in the woods.While waiting for Jeff's arrival, NesQuick and I ran into my hiking buddy, Moses. He was considering hiking out, but I told him Jeff was coming and that meant we had wheels and a fun night in store. He decided to stay and join in on what would become a crazy fun night. Jeff arrived, hugged me, and said, ""Here's your duct tape. See ya later."" I introduced him to Moses and NesQuick and the four of us walked to Hey Joes Tacos and More for lunch. Jeff treated, which was cool of him. Whether it has been five days or five years since I've last seen Jeff, we always pick up right where we left off. I told him that in trail towns, hikers are either eating or planning the next meal. It's what we do. We decided the next stop was the grocery store to get some ice cream, so Jeff drove us there. We then went to Beaverdam Creek and, like the Little Rascals, sat on the creek bank eating Ben and Jerry's, talking, and enjoying a few moments off our feet.We decided Jeff needed a trail name because ""Jeff"" as a trail name is as boring as they come. Jeff had an eye injury as a child which eventually resulted in him losing the eye as an adult. It was devastating to him at first but, consistent with his nature, he's learned to take it in stride and even have fun with it. He looked at us and said, ""How about Cy Clops?"" It never occurred to us to name him after a race of savage, one-eyed giants, but in retrospect it was a brilliant choice. It also signaled that his one eye was fair game for some friendly banter. Eye, for One, loved the name. It's a (Stevie) wonder we hadn't thought of it sooner.After stopping by another Outfitter and then a coffee shop, Cy Clops drove us back down to the center of town. Moses, appropriately focused on the next meal, suggested we drive to Abingdon for supper. That night we went into Abingdon and had fantastic BBQ at Bonefire Smokehouse. It was so good that NesQuick, a vegetarian who hasn't eaten meat in three years, ate a plate full of pig and cow! As Cy Clops discussed the menu with the waitress, she suggested he consider the 3-meat combo...to which I replied, ""he's had his EYE on that ever since we got here!"" NesQuick and Moses nearly spit water out as we laughed uncontrollably.On our way back to Damascus, Cy Clops reached for the radio. I just knew he was going to play Eye of the Tiger, Hungry Eye, Don't It Make My Brown Eye Blue, or For Your Eye Only. NesQuick was expecting Brown Eyed Girl, When You Close Your Eye, Private Eye, or Betty Davis Eye. Moses was holding out for In Your Eye, Eye Without a Face, You Can't Hide Your Lyin' Eye, or anything from Third Eye Blind. Instead, we returned to our roots and started rocking out to Queen, Prince, Michael Jackson, and the Backstreet Boys. Cy Clops and I shared lead vocals, while NesQuick and Moses handled backup vocals and lead air guitar and air drums from the backseat. We sang our hearts out. Prince would have wanted us to. It felt like 1983 at McGuire AFB all over again. We could have only sounded better had we been in a recording studio...and had talent. Cy Clops circled the grocery store parking lot two dozen times as we sang Bohemian Rhapsody. (See the video at https://youtu.be/ZeMyEXRbxbY )As we sang, ""Momma, just killed a man...put a gun against his head, pulled the trigger, now he's dead"" with the windows down, three concerned young skateboarders picked up their boards and left the parking lot. We cruised the ""backstreets"" of Damascus several times singing I Want It That Way. To Cy Clops' credit, he kept one eye on the road...for he could do no more.Cy Clops and I returned to the hostel and talked for a couple more hours. He told me about some of the celebrities he had met and interacted with during his many years as a flight attendant. The list includes Dr J (enormous hands), Kate Beckinsale (during a 30-minute conversation, he offered her his thoughts on a character in a tv series her husband produces), Nelly (charged his phone using Jeff's portable battery), Larry Bird (told him he could lie down in the aisle if his back hurt), Prince Andrew, Vanilla Ice, Cheap Trick, George Carlin, Darryl Dawkins (Chocolate Thunder), Ron Howard, and Bo Jackson.The conversation then became a little more serious. We shared our experiences and pain related to the deaths of our mothers...and he discussed the difficulty in losing his eye and the end of his marriage. It was a good ""bro talk"" and felt good to share some deep thoughts, something ""bros"" are not always good at. He showed me the SOCOM coin I had given him at my retirement ceremony, and then reciprocated by giving me a set of his flight attendant wings and a Paracord Survival Strap Bracelet with OEF (Operation Enduring Freedom) Veteran written on it. It was a very thoughtful gesture and I will wear the bracelet proudly on my thru-hike attempt.I've said it before and I'll say it again...hiking 2189.1 miles and reaching Katahdin's summit is my ultimate bucket list goal. But the AT is so much more about the journey...the interesting people, the views, the trail towns, and all the crazy things that happen along the way. That's why I try hard not to get caught up in the mentality of having big mileage days and getting the trail done quickly. The AT is a magnificent, 22-course meal that is meant to be slowly savored a bite at a time. The last one from the dinner table wins. While I'm sure many great memories and experiences remain in store for me, I doubt there will be a more fun night than the one had by Fob, Moses, NesQuick, and Cy Clops as they cruised the Damascus roads and partied like it was 1999.Fob","Damascus, VA

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533539,"Day 47Cy Clops and I awoke and got packed up. I gave him my winter gear (base layer pants and shirt, winter gloves, & thick socks) along with my prescription sunglasses (not used) and rain pants (not used enough) to mail to Janet for me. This will lower my pack weight and volume until I need these items again later on up north.We then headed to Mojoe's Trailside Coffeehouse for breakfast...Cyclops by car and me my foot, as I had not yet hiked that section of the trail through town. Moses and Conductor joined us for breakfast. Conductor informed us that 25% of aspiring thru-hikers never make it beyond Neels Gap (mile 31.7) and another 25% never make it beyond Damascus (mile 469). While it feels good to have achieved that milestone, being in the ""top 50%"" isn't the goal. The goal is to reach Katahdin's summit and earn the title Thru-Hiker.Moses and I took a few photos with Cy Clops, said our farewells, and headed north out of Damascus...with Bohemian Rhapsody still ringing in our ears. Near mile 474 Moses, Conductor, several other hikers and I stopped for second breakfast and to ponder a warning sign. It told us that a bridge was out .5 miles ahead and thus, to avoid having to ford a river, an approved (and shorter) detour could be taken. Moses, the only one among us with any chance of parting the waters, chose the detour. I had waited a lifetime to ford an AT river and, along with several others, chose not to take the shortcut. I got to the river and saw that there was a moderately risky path across on boulders, but they were slick, wet, and spaced such that trekking poles would be needed to jump from one boulder to the next. It was a water and rock Fobstacle Course. I estimated that I could probably make the journey 3 out of 4 times without falling in. Liking those odds, I just went for it without taking my boots off. I made it! That wouldn't have happened 30 pounds ago. As I reached the other side, the other hikers were putting on their shoes and socks so I assume they walked across in their water shoes.Light rain fell off and on throughout the day. At mile 481.3 I stopped to eat the second half of my Subway spicy Italian sub from Damascus and soak my feet in a stream. A couple miles later I passed the long and beautiful Luther Hassinger Memorial Bridge. After 15.8 miles I called it a day and tented with Moses, Conductor and others near the Lost Mountain Shelter. Just as I got in my tent and zipped up inside my sleeping bag, the sky opened up and a massive thunderstorm hit.

Near mile 490.6 Moses caught up to me near the summit of Whitetop Mountain. As we sat there on a couple of rocks having snacks, two deer approached fairly closely, froze, stared at us, and then wandered off. I was able to video that and post it to my Facebook page. After descending the mountain, Moses, Olive Oil and I took a long break at the VA 600 parking lot. I spread out my wet rain fly and ground cloth so they could dry out in the sun, and laid in the thick grass picking granola crumbs out of my beard.After a 12.3 mile day I stopped at Thomas Knob Shelter, well within the southern boundary of wild pony country. While I'm really not much of a horse guy (that's Lil Jan's domain), for some reason I was pretty excited to see and interact with some midget wild ponies. Unfortunately, my first interaction was anything but positive. As I traveled for water at a spring 50 yards behind the shelter, I approached a momma pony just standing there a yard or two off the path. At her feet was her dead baby pony or foal. We believe it died in the heavy thunderstorm the night before. A hiker returning from the spring told me the mom had been standing over it for the past three hours. She would occasionally nudge it, trying to wake it up. It was the saddest thing to watch. I wondered how long she would stay there before realizing all hope was gone. Whether it be humans or ponies, there is something very special about the love and care of a mother for her offspring.As I went to hang my bear bag near the shelter that evening, two wild ponies emerged from the woods and walked right by me. It was strange, exciting, and magical, and I started channeling my inner Dr. Doolittle. I wondered why I was hanging a bear bag, when surely a bear would choose a fresh wild pony over packaged Beef Stroganoff. In my unbridled enthusiasm, I asked if they were from Filly and whether they were Spurs fans. They didn't speak, but I could tell they thought I was a stud, maybe even the shelter mare. I told them I had Ramen noodle-induced trots, was not stable, and couldn't talk furlong.A bit later, just before sunset, I explored an area north of the shelter and came across a campsite with more wild ponies. All I could think of was that every dad (or mom) with a daughter (or son) who loves horses really needs to camp here and give them the experience of a lifetime. I decided it was time to fulfill another sub-AT bucket list item and interview Mary Brook, a wild talking pony. I chose her because of her pleasant disposition, wide girth, and ability to speak English. Video of the interview is posted on my Facebook page. I harnessed my courage and asked her if she had ever seen a long distance hiker better looking than me (answer: nay); whether it bothered her being a midget horse and having people call her names like Colt Shorty-Five (answer: nay); and whether she would like to go to ""mane"" with me (answer: nay). Off camera she told me, ""I canter do this interview any more,"" and then left the area with a handsome mustang.I returned to the shelter, ate some cheese with thorough bread, and then took a position next to Conductor in the shelter's hind quarters. All horsing aside, I needed a good night's sleep in order to get out of the gait early and get a leg up on the other hikers.Fob","Lost Mountain Shelter

As I exited the shelter full of sleeping hikers with regular sized prostates, I heard a sound over by the picnic table. I looked up and there was a wild pony grazing only 10 yards from the shelter. That was an early indication that this was going to a magnificent day 2 on the magical wild pony mystery tour.I packed up and headed AT north towards Grayson Highlands State Park. So without further ado, let me go ahead and announce that we have a new champion for best AT section! Yes, the 5-mile section from the Mount Rogers side trail (mile 497) to the northern end of Grayson Highlands State Park (mile 502.4) is, in my humble opinion, the overall best section of trail to date. The Roan Highlands north of Carvers Gap moves to second place and the section of trail in the Smokies from Spence Field Shelter to Thunderhead Mountain moves to third. What makes Grayson Highlands so special? Start with wonderful vistas in every direction. Add in varied terrain, including rock climbs, rolling balds, majestic forests, and even Fat Man's Squeeze. Finally, top it off with dozens of midget wild ponies roaming freely. I stopped and visited with several of them. It's the kind of section you might come up with if you were designing a perfect AT section on a computer. I will be bringing my wife and future grandchildren here someday. You can count on that.Near the end of this incredible section, I crossed the 500 mile mark on my AT journey. Like so many hikers who have gone before me, I paused for a moment, took a picture, and joined The Proclaimers in singing, ""I would walk 500 miles, and I would walk 500 more."" Then I added, ""And then I'd walk 500 miles, and then I'd walk 689.1 more."" Shortly after reaching this milestone, I came across trail maintainers from Konnarock, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy's flagship crew program. The crew, volunteers of different ages and backgrounds, work on the AT from Rockfish Gap, near Waynesboro, Virginia, to the Trail's southern terminus at Springer Mountain in Georgia. I stopped for a few moments to thank them for their service and discuss their plans for the day and week. I just really appreciate people who volunteer their time to cut fallen trees, move rocks, shovel dirt, and do whatever else is necessary to give us hikers a much better path to traverse.As I approached The Scales livestock corral at mile 505.5, there was a longhorn bull standing in the middle of the trail, just looking at me. I know almost nothing about farming and cattle, but assumed those horns could be used to defend against a coyote, scratch itself, or gore a long distance hiker. I gave him some space and apologized for all the beef I had eaten, and will continue to eat, in my lifetime. He eventually moved on a few feet and I quickly hiked by without incident. As I passed through The Scales corral, I stopped and read a display about the history of the place. Long ago, ranchers determined their cattle were more profitable if they were weighed heavy at a corral atop a mountain, rather than herding them to the valley where they would weigh less. That makes sense.Around mile 515 it was good to see Cambria and a few other hikers who had stopped along the trail to eat some supper. Cambria, you may recall, is the young lady who was not only born in the same state as me (Delaware), but at the same hospital at Dover Air Force Base. However, since I am roughly thirty years older than her, I suspect our mothers used different Fobstetricians.After an incredible, 21.1 mile, wild pony-filled day…my longest mileage day to date…I stealth camped by a stream with Conductor, Tumbleweed, and Princess Grit. I learned that Grit is a section hiker from Nashville, Tennessee who models for Nissan at car shows around the country. I waited for her to ask if I, too, was a model, but the question never came.Fob","Thomas Knob Shelter

I arrived there just before 3 p.m. and went in on a large pizza and family-sized cheese bread with Reading Man. We devoured it at the shelter picnic table and shared some with Dirty Deed, Buckles, Grit, Olive Oil, and others.Around 4:30 p.m. I checked the forecast and saw that rain was expected to begin in 3 hours and last for 3 days. Given the somewhat crowded shelter and Fob's Law #1...""shelters with 7 or more people will have at least one loud snorer who needs to be stabbed in the temple with a spork""...I decided to hike on.As I climbed Glade Mountain, I could feel the storm approaching and kicked it into high gear to get to a flat spot at the summit. At mile 537.6, after a 19.4 mile day, I pitched my tent, hung my bear bag, and crawled into the tent just as rain started to fall. Before dozing off to heavy rain, I received a message from my friend, Darrell Brimberry, with a video clip of Heart performing Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven at the Kennedy Center Honors. Great stuff!I would estimate that the closest human being to me to the north was more than 1.5 miles away at the next shelter...and more than 5 miles away to the south. That brings up a question that I'm frequently asked by friends and family: Does it bother you to hike alone or sometimes camp alone atop mountains and other remote places?I will attempt to answer that in a way that only my youngest, Myers-Briggs loving son, Kyle, aka The Trailpooper, aka B.W. Pot, can appreciate. Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother, Katharine Briggs, developed a personality inventory to make C. G. Jung's theory of psychological types understandable and useful in people's lives. (I used to teach AP Psych so bear with me as I geek out a bit.) By answering a series of questions, you can find out to which of the 16 personality types you belong. It turns out both Kyle and I are ENTJs...Extraverted, iNtuitive, Thinking, and Judging...aka, The Commander...aka, The Executive. That's one reason he and I are so much alike. That can be both a good and bad thing on the AT:The Good...- Driven, determined...loves a big challenge (probably explains why I'm out here).- Confident...given enough time and resources, believes any goal can be achieved, sometimes through sheer willpower.- Extremely rational...helps with AT decision-making related to logistics, mileage, etc. For big decisions, B.W. Pot and I will typically (and nerdily) write out pros and cons on a sheet of paper to help in our analysis. If I'm feeling especially nerdy, I'll put said pros and cons into an Excel spreadsheet. What gets me into the Nerd Hall of Fame (and sucks the joy out of life) is when I weight each factor by importance, and then multiply, and then sum the columns to mathematically compute the right, rational, best choice. I still make plenty of bad decisions, but rarely because I didn't analyze the pros and cons involved.- The Extroverted (E) nature, which I'm just barely (52%/48%) makes me comfortable and able to draw energy from groups (at shelters, campfires, etc.). I enjoy good conversation and being around people as much as anyone.- The 48% Introverted (I) nature makes me just as comfortable and able to draw energy from being/hiking alone, solo camping atop a mountain, reading by a quiet lake, etc. Some of my best thinking and writing happens in solitude. Don't ever worry that I'm unhappy when I'm alone on the trail. Still, I miss my wife whether I'm alone or with people.- Thinks strategically, with a long term focus (summiting Katahdin), while executing each step of their plans with determination and precision (5 million steps actually!).- Strong-willed - unlikely to give up when the going gets tough (time will tell)- Inspirational - hopefully to some...at least my two sons who are my pride and joy and the two folks on the planet I most want to inspire, encourage, and mentor. If I leave any legacy after I'm dead and gone, it will be those two fellas. Well, them and a couple of ladies who have written incredibly encouraging things to me on my Trailjournals guest book.The Bad...- Sometimes not emotionally expressive...more likely to analyze/rationalize with a fellow hiker who's hurting than to give them the hug and shoulder to cry on they actually need.- Low tolerance for people viewed as inefficient, incompetent, or lazy (""of course you're struggling, you have a 12-lb. stove!"").- Can sometimes be condescending, insensitive, and arrogant...not me, but other ENTJs. :-)- Too much willpower/confidence can lead to pushing their vision/agenda, and theirs alone. As a mostly solo hiker, it's probably good that I don't have to regularly confer/negotiate with others on when to start and stop, where to stay, and the myriad other daily decisions that couples/groups hiking together deal with. All decisions out here are mine alone, however good or bad they be.- Sometimes impatient and intolerant. More likely to confront (rationally, of course) or walk away from a pot smoker, than to sit there breathing it in and ""tolerating"" it. Also, I have to take the AT golden rule, ""Hike Your Own Hike,"" to heart, so as not to be judgmental towards people going about things contrary to my approach (like those who slack pack).Among the famous ENTJs in history are Julius Caesar, David Letterman, and Jeb Bush...and I can see a bit of each of them in me and Kyle. Other famous ENTJs include Adolf Hitler and Hillary Clinton, the knowledge of which keeps me up at night.Anyway, I would encourage everyone to take the Myers-Briggs test and see how well it captures your personality. It can help you to leverage your personality strengths and be aware of potential weaknesses. If you disagree with me, you are clearly irrational and need to reconsider your position. I have a spreadsheet you can use.Fob","Stealth Campsite

PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535013,"""Into each life some rain must fall.""    - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow""The best thing one can do when it's raining is to let it rain.""    - Henry Wadsworth LongfellowDay 51Light rain, particularly on a warm, muggy day, is a refreshing thing on the AT. Heavy rain and rain that lasts for several days gets old pretty quickly. It makes everything more challenging...the trail can become muddy (or even turn into a stream), the hiking pace slows, rocks become slicker, and visibility drops making the ""money"" views not so grand. For wearers of glasses, your choices are to take them off and have blurred vision, or leave them on and drive in the rain with no windshield wiper. While the contents of a well-packed and covered backpack can mostly stay dry, the same cannot be said for the hiker carrying it. You end up soaked to the bone by the rain and by your own sweat forming under any attempts to cover yourself with rain gear. Wet socks/feet make you more susceptible to blistering. If it's rainy and cold, the misery factor increases as does the chance of getting sick.Four upsides to all this: 1) water sources will be more frequent and reliable; 2) you appreciate the sunshine that will eventually appear so much more; 3) overcoming shared rainy misery bonds hikers; and 4) like other AT challenges, overcoming extended rain makes you a tougher, more resilient person.Day 51 was a rainy day. My approach was to wear very little (shorts, sometimes a shirt, and boots), spend time in prayer, think positive thoughts, and keep moving. Near a stream at mile 540.1, two rabbits hopped by alongside the trail. That didn't lift my spirits much but here's what did...Trail Magic! The historic Lindamood School, part of the Settlers Museum, is a one-room schoolhouse from the 1890s. A local Baptist church stocks it with free food, drinks, and supplies for hikers. It would have been magic enough to simply have a place to get a break from the rain. All the goodies inside were a much appreciated bonus. Yet another church group letting their light shine on the AT!After a short, rainy 6.2 mile and day, I decided to stop in Atkins and dry out at the Relax Inn. After checking in, my first stop was the delicious All-You-Can-Eat buffet at the nearby Barn Restaurant, a hiker favorite. By mid-afternoon the rain stopped and I was able to lay out my wet tent and boots in the parking lot while I did laundry. Since the laundry room was next to my room, I was able to put all my clothes in the washer and then sprint to my room wearing just a towel. As I entered my room, I noticed a trellis on the far side of the parking lot that would be a perfect spot to hang my tent. Not seeing anyone around, I grabbed my tent and ran across the parking lot in my towel. After hanging it and beginning the return sprint, I looked over and Princess Grit was entering the parking lot. She yelled, ""Is that you, Fob?"" and I yelled back, ""Never heard of him!"" and ducked into my room.That night Buddah Jim, Princess Grit, several other hikers and I ate at a Mexican restaurant attached to, appropriately, a gas station. Buddah Jim told me all about his work at a psychiatric hospital. Based on his description of some of the patients, I believe most aspiring thru-hikers would feel right at home there.Fob","Glade Mountain

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535281,"Day 52Before leaving the motel, I picked up a couple of items from the hiker box, including some beef jerky. A few miles after crossing the I-81 underpass out of Atkins, I reached mile 547.275...the one quarter mark on the Appalachian Trail! Later that day, near mile 556, I saw my 6th harmless AT snake.At mile 557.3, atop Brushy Mountain, I started getting hungry and remembered the beef jerky I had picked up from the motel's hiker box. That sounded good so I reached into the package, pulled out two pieces, and stuffed them in my mouth. Instantly, I knew something was wrong. They tasted like wet cardboard that had been sautéed in bacon grease. I gagged for a moment and then swallowed them simply for the calories. A little while later, I commented on the disappointing beef jerky to a fellow hiker. He looked at the package and said, ""Dude, you're eating dog treats!"" I couldn't believe it! There was no mention of dogs or pictures of dogs on the package. There were some Spanish phrases on the package, but nothing about perros (dogs). Later, I complained to Conductor about the misleading labeling. He asked who made them and I told him Gravy Train. He told me Gravy Train is a well-known dog food company, so the package really doesn't need a warning label stating, ""These are dog treats. Not to be consumed by hikers."" And yet, having stuffed the bacon-flavored cardboard in my mouth, I would say it does. They were so bad, in fact, that I'm not even sure our dog, Mandy, would eat them.As I ascended Lynn Camp Mountain, I saw and got video of AT Snake #7, a black snake. I checked the forecast and saw that heavy rain was due to hit in about 30 minutes. It was time to descend the mountain in full beast mode. I kicked it into high gear and made it to a pretty campsite right on Lick Creek with enough time to pitch my tent, heat up some instant potatoes to accompany my Mike n Ikes, and hang my bear bag. Then, with the sun setting and a light rain beginning to fall, I caught my second AT fish using a piece of Slim Jim. I would have used some beef jerky for bait, but Gravy Train is really just for dogs.Fob","Relax Inn, Atkins

At every fork in the road, you make a choice. And it is those decisions that shape our lives.""    - Mike DeWineDay 53Shortly after breaking camp and beginning the long ascent up Chestnut Knob, it began to rain. Once again, my strategy (when it's not too cold) was to wear as little as possible. It may sound strange, but I rarely wear my rain jacket in the rain. With enough rain, you still end up wet and the rain jacket only adds to the wetness by making you perspire more. I'd rather just have my quick-drying synthetic t-shirt get wet, and have my dry rain jacket available for duty around camp at night.As I reached Chestnut Knob Shelter, a fully enclosed concrete shelter, a heavy rain began to pour. I quickly stepped in and ended up staying three hours with Hopscotch, a southbound section hiker. He was on his way to Damascus for Trail Days, and we shared notes on the trail ahead. He is a military Intel analyst/cryptologist, so we shared a few war stories. The rain eventually subsided and I headed back out and across a very long, rocky ridge at Garden Mountain. The rocks took a toll on my feet and legs, with the feet alternating between pain and numbness. After an 11.6 mile, rain filled day, I headed 25 yards downhill from the ridge and stealth camped at mile 573.8. Shortly after hunkering down in my tent, the rain began to fall again.This is as good a time as any discuss the popular and somewhat overused AT expression, ""Hike Your Own Hike."" It basically means each person ""owns"" their AT hike and gets to decide the right way to hike it for them. It also means hikers shouldn't criticize others who hold different views. Still, you'll find some friendly banter between hikers as they discuss their respective positions on a host of issues. Here, then, are my personal opinions on some of these issues. This is how I'm ""hiking my own hike"". I don't judge or criticize others for holding different views...at least not to their face.1. Must one hike the 8.8 mile Approach Trail from Amicalola Falls State Park to Springer Mountain in Georgia? My view: Absolutely not. Rationale:- Quite simply, it's not part of the 2189.1 mile AT. I'm attempting to hike the AT, not trails that feed the AT. I wouldn't hike the 8.8 miles leading to the start of the AT any more than I would continue north for 8.8 miles after summiting Katahdin.- I'm told it's a very difficult, strenuous way to begin the hike, making a raw hiker susceptible to injury. A fellow hiker, Dirty Deed, who did the Approach Trail, in retrospect called it a complete waste of time.- I had a group of 10 family and friends who wanted to join me and hike the first mile of the AT with me. Thus, it was easier for everyone to meet at the Springer Mountain parking lot and hike to the southern terminus together.- So I didn't do and wouldn't recommend the Approach Trail, although I joined with a few family members and walked up the killer stairs at Amicalola Falls (part of the Approach Trail) on our way to lunch at the lodge.2. Is it acceptable to take blue blazed shortcuts (to dodge a difficult section or hit a prettier section) or Aqua blaze (canoe parallel to the trail)? My view: Absolutely not. Rationale:- A successful thru-hike, to me, occurs when one hikes all 2189.1 miles. I would forever regret taking any shortcuts that lessen that mileage by even a foot. In fact, I always exit a shelter on the same path I came in on so as to not miss a single white blaze.- Also, I'm hiking the AT, not canoeing, kayaking, horseback riding, or snowmobiling it. My goal is to be a thru-hiker, not a thru-traveler. Using any method other than my legs (and butt, occasionally) would cause me to have to put an asterisk by my name in the honor roll. To me, hiking it all means HIKING...IT ALL.3. Northbound or Southbound or Flip-Flop (typically, Harpers Ferry to Maine, then Harpers Ferry to GA)? My view: Northbound. Rationale:- Most importantly, I want to be standing at Katahdin's summit, with my hands in the air, at the END of my journey. That's the iconic photo. In fact, at photo boards at hostels and elsewhere, I've not seen one of a hiker concluding a thru-hike by summiting Springer or strolling into Harper's Ferry on a flip-flop.- Some say Katahdin is the most difficult of all the climbs on the AT, and I like the idea of saving that final big test for last.- Most hikers go northbound, and I like interacting with others. While that causes occasional crowding at shelters early on, the herd quickly thins out and there is as much solitude as you want.- The last hundred miles on the AT in Maine is reportedly difficult and barren wilderness. I'd rather end there as an experienced hiker with trail legs rather than begin there as an inexperienced, overweight rookie.- All that said, I recognize there are benefits to going southbound or flip-flopping, including weather, family reasons, more solitude, etc. SOBOs who complete the AT are most certainly thru-hikers and I wouldn't put an asterisk by their name. I just prefer being a NOBO.4. Is it okay to ""slack pack"", which means you have someone else (a friend, family member, hostel owner, etc) carry (drive) your backpack for you for a day or more so you can do an unencumbered, bigger mileage day? My view: Absolutely not. This would earn me the dreaded asterisk by my name. Rationale:- Part of the AT's appeal is the high level of difficulty and a big part of that is carrying a 25 to 35 pound backpack. That's my job...not someone else's. I wouldn't go whitewater rafting and have someone else paddle for me, or go on the world's fastest roller coaster and have them apply a brake throughout to make it easier. If I wanted an easier challenge, I'd have chosen an easier trail...or just gone bowling.- Almost without exception, slack packers have to rush to hit the big miles and rendezvous with their backpack. Rushing is the last thing I want to do. Big, easy miles isn't my goal. It's about enjoying the journey. One female slack packer zoomed by me to reach her 30-mile day, with thunderstorms forecasted. I asked her what her intentions were regarding (not yet blogged about) McAfee Knob, arguably the second most famous landmark on the trail. Out of breath, she said, ""Don't have time to stop there. Gotta hit pickup point. Will have to return some day to get a pic and enjoy."" Seriously? If I were to skip (or rush) McAfee Knob, lookouts, waterfalls, etc., due to a time pressure to have a big mileage day, I'd be missing the main purpose of hiking the AT. I'm not suggesting all slack packers miss all the cool sights. I am suggesting you are more likely to miss cool things when you're rushing.- Along those same lines, I came across this note in an AT shelter log by a fellow hiker named Arrow: ""How many of us gazed off Black Rock, splashed in the waters of a 200' falls, relaxed in the sun on Apple Orchard Mountain, and scrambled over the massive boulders of the Devils Marble Yard? Since when did big mileage become so important that we are willing to skip wonderful side adventures? Since when did we begin to focus so much on a number that we miss the things that make the AT so beautiful and exciting? Many of us came here to escape the busy, over-productive, hurry-hurry civilization, but perhaps we have brought it along with us?"" He nailed it!- There is often a fee for the shuttle service, and possibly also for a second night at the hostel if you hike back to it.- No flexibility to stop early for the day in real bad weather. You simply have to get to the pickup point.- Most importantly, for me, is that my mom's ashes are in a pouch inside my backpack. She will remain in it, and it will not leave my sight. My pack is an extension of me on many levels, and it will remain with me to the end.So those are my personal views on what it means for me to hike my own hike. Each hiker resolves these issues in a way that works for them. So long as we all can look ourselves in the mirror at the end and feel good about our hike (however we defined it), that's the main thing. I guess that same principle applies to how you live your life, and how you'll feel about your life as you reflect on it towards the end of the journey.Fob","Lick Creek

Do what you can."" - Sydney SmithDay 54I awoke, checked my beard for ticks, threw down a pop tart, and headed out. It didn't take long for light rain to begin to fall, and it continued for most of the day. Mentally, I played a little game and told myself that every drop of rain that hit me today was going to make me stronger and more determined. That may sound silly, but it beats letting multiple days of rain wear you down mentally and physically. You play whatever mental games you must to stay motivated and hiking. I know of several hikers now off the trail, essentially because multiple days of rain took a heavy toll and they were no longer having fun.By mid-afternoon, the rain let up just a bit, and I passed a series of poster board signs on trees announcing Trail Magic ahead! Signs are not necessary to draw hikers in, but they did build anticipation and made me drool just a bit. After all the rain, it couldn't have come at a better time. As I approached the tent and chairs, I could tell this was going to be something special. They had a generator going to charge hiker electronics. Anyone who goes to that level of trouble to meet hikers' needs is about to deliver some magic...and they did!The Trail Angels were DeAnn and Dave Werner, from Pennsylvania, along with DeAnn's sister, Deb, and her husband, Vince. Dave informed me that their daughter's fiancé, trail name J-Bird, thru-hiked the AT in 2010 and had a wonderful experience. He especially appreciated all the Trail Magic and wanted to return to the AT in 2011 and serve as a Trail Angel himself. Unfortunately and sadly, he was diagnosed with colon cancer, died in 2012, and never got the chance to be a Trail Angel. In his honor, DeAnn and Dave have been returning to the trail as Trail Angels every first week of May since he died, giving the magic to hikers that J-Bird himself so badly wanted to give. Their Trail Magic was magnificent and truly honored J-Bird's memory. There was a lot of food, including fruit, vegetables, hot dogs, and scrumptious meatball sandwiches. They also offered a mini-hiker store, with everything from batteries to wet wipes to hygiene supplies yet it was all free. There were all sorts of drinks and desserts. To top it all off, they had cards and pens so we could write messages to our loved ones, and also took care of putting the postage on and mailing them. Thanks to them, I was able to send a Mother's Day card to Lil Jan. I thanked them from the bottom of my heart, and told them they truly had honored J-Bird's memory in a big way. I left with not only a re-charged phone and battery, but a full belly and just an overall better outlook on life. That's what Trail Magic can do for a tired hiker who has been busting his butt up and down mountains in the rain for several days.After 16.1 miles, I rolled into Bland, Virginia and hitched a ride with Bubba to the Big Walker Motel. I was initially reluctant to stay at a town called Bland, but after looking at the map, I realized it was a better option than Boring, Iowa or Mediocre, Minnesota. Bubba was quite the character for a Bland guy. As a shuttler of hikers, he has seen his fair share of interesting things. Two of his experiences are particularly noteworthy:- He once shuttled two female German hikers who rode in the back of his pickup truck with their gear. He noticed a car swerving behind him and looked back and the girls had removed their wet tops to let them air out. (In this context, I'm not entirely sure what ""them"" refers to.) He told them public highway nudity was not allowed in this country (except maybe in Mississippi) and they acted surprised. They were probably from Boobvaria. I told him it's a good thing he handled the situation, otherwise the town would've been renamed Notso Bland. More on Bubba and this story at http://m.swvatoday.com/news/article_d8c02b40-f5eb-11e5-b883-531ab1bda78c.html?mode=jqm- He also gave a ride, and later received a thank you card, from a hiker with the trail name Bismarck. He found out later that Bismarck had been hiking the AT for six years, to avoid being arrested for embezzling $8.7 million from Pepsi, his employer. The law eventually caught up with Bismarck at Trail Days in Damascus, Virginia, and he ended up in prison. Bubba told me they recovered less than $1 million and there are rumors that Bismarck stashed the money at various spots on the AT. I'll begin looking immediately. More on Bismarck, the AT fugitive, can be found here... http://www.sbnation.com/longform/2015/7/1/8861183/james-hammes-appalachian-trail-bismarckI checked into my room at the Big Walker Motel and checked the forecast. It was supposed to be cold and rainy all day the following day. Thus, I decided to take a zero day. That night, I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, a salad, and a large, family-sized order of cinnamon rolls and had them delivered to my room. After eating a few thousand calories worth of food, I took a hot bath and shower, and then hand-washed my clothes in the tub. I went to bed that night thankful for the Trail Magic I had received, and thankful to be clean, out of the rain, and full of pasta and countless cinnamon rolls.Fob","Stealth Camp, Mile 573.8

Some days are just like that. When you hit a wall, physically and/or emotionally, you just have to grind it out and keep your head up.Just a couple of miles into the morning hike, I took a side trail .3 miles west to check out the beautiful Dismal Falls. The scenic waterfall and the surrounding campsites may very well be the best water-based place to camp on the AT thus far. On my way to the falls I saw Dawn, aka Slim Rim, hiking out and we chatted briefly. At the falls I had the place to myself. I set my pack and trekking pokes down, ate a snack, took some pictures and video, took care of some business, and then decided to check out the place. Specifically, I wanted to walk along the edge of the water and look for fish. And that's when it happened. As I nonchalantly walked around some large, wet, flat rocks, not really paying attention, my feet slipped out from under me and I went airborne, landing flat on my back! Actually, my back, butt, and right elbow all hit at the same time, with my elbow bearing the brunt of it. I was in immense pain and was somehow embarrassed, even though no one else was around. It was my first fall on the AT, at mile 610, and it happened on a side excursion with my backpack off. I felt very thankful that I didn't crack my skull. If I had, instead of my blog, you might be reading my Fobituary.I gathered myself, felt around for damage (bruised elbow, muddy shorts, dislocated ego), and then continued northward. It was an overcast day, with occasional showers, and I walked alongside various streams and crossed bridges throughout the day. In the afternoon my feet started to ache all over. They became especially sensitive to stepping on sharp rocks, which happens hundreds of times throughout a typical day. On top of that, the elbow pain from my fall worsened and I wasn't able to push off on my right trekking pole during climbs. As a hiker who relies heavily on forearms and trekking poles for power and balance during climbs, this is a problem. I felt like someone had popped me in the elbow with a hammer.On top of of the physical pain that afternoon, I felt really sad that I was missing my son Kyle's and future daughter-in-law Laci's college graduation. Realistically, to hike the trail I had to choose between their graduation today or their wedding the following weekend and the wedding won out. Although they understood and supported that decision, I felt terrible about it. They had both had such remarkable college experiences. It's one of those family sacrifices you have to make to hike the AT, and emotionally it hit me pretty hard. Exhausted, bummed, and in foot and elbow pain, I had simply had enough and just stopped in my tracks. Time to set up camp. It had been a tough 17.1 mile day, mentally and physically. As I sat there cooking Chili Mac, Dawn and then later Conductor and Whistler (aka Mowgli) passed by and asked how I was doing. I said, ""Fine, thanks."" I lied.Fob","Stealth Camp, Mile 606

As I crawled out of my tent that morning to retrieve my bear bag, pain shot through both of my feet. It was the sorest I ever remember them being. I brought my food bag back into my tent, ate a pop tart, and sat there rubbing my feet. I then remembered that it was Mothers Day, the first one since my dear mother passed away. I'm not much of a crier (ENTJs tend not to be all that emotionally expressive) but I laid back on my air mattress and had my first good long AT cry. It was a combination of thinking about mom, missing my wife, missing graduation, nursing an injured elbow, and dealing with foot pain that made it difficult to take even a step. Of my 58 days on the AT so far, I had reached my lowest point. I took a few Advil, poured out my heart to God, and then wrote a poem for my mom. Writing has always been therapeutic to me as it allows me to unscramble and process my thoughts and emotions. Prayer has a similar effect because I know God knows my heart and struggles and is ready to give me whatever I need to get through the day.I eventually pulled myself together and counted my blessings. I am an immensely blessed person and I wouldn't trade lives with anyone. Still, just like the AT, life has its peaks and valleys and I was in a temporary valley. I thought about people and families I know courageously dealing with cancer and brain injuries and other things far worse than the sadness and foot pain I was experiencing. I realized I simply needed a break from the trail and, fortunately, a break was coming! All I needed to do was hobble 11.1 miles along a flat, and then descending, section of trail into Pearisburg. So that's what I did.Conductor caught up with me and we hiked together for the last few miles. He is one of my favorite hikers and I'm glad our paths have crossed several times. As a guy who previously thru-hiked the AT several years ago (and had an injury-riddled failed attempt last year), he has tremendous credibility in answering trail questions. He does that very humbly and only when asked, so he doesn't come across as a know-it-all. We both are retired military and love the AT, so there are always plenty of things to talk about. After hiking into Pearisburg, checking into the motel, and showering (separately), we headed across the street for some great Mexican food and more conversation. He really lifted my spirits, as did the motel manager who offered to do my laundry for free.That evening, after a hot bath, my feet were feeling a little better so I decided to walk to the other side of town and attend worship services at the Pearisburg Church of Christ. I arrived a few minutes before 6:00 p.m., the start time according to my google search. No one was there. I called the number listed as the contact person to get more information and got no answer. Oh well. I hiked back to the motel, stopping at Pizza Hut along the way for some pizza and salad.My original plan was to take a zero day in Pearisburg on Monday, and then rent a car and head to Alabama on Tuesday for the wedding week activities. While sitting at the Pizza Hut, I decided to accelerate that by a day because I missed my wife and family, and an extra rental car day would be less than an extra night at the motel.I decided to keep my day early arrival a secret to Lil Jan, and just told our friends, the Diamonds (with whom she's staying) about the plan. In just a matter of hours, I had gone from the valley of pain, exhaustion, and sadness to the mountaintop of anticipation in seeing my wife, other family, and friends. I needed rest, a break from hiking and some normalcy. I needed my family. I needed to be a part of the wedding festivities. I needed some extended time on the mountaintop. And God was about to pour out all those blessings on me big time.Fob","Stealth Camp, Mile 623.1

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536618,"""When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.""    - When Harry Met Sally""I love you, not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you. I love you, not only for what you have made of yourself, but for what you are making of me."" - Roy CroftDay 59I awoke in a much better mood than the previous two days. In fact, I was giddy. I checked out of the motel and walked downhill about a mile to the rental car place. They put me in a brand new car with under 100 miles on it and I headed west toward Alabama and wedding week. It felt really weird to drive a car again, but I quickly adjusted. I cranked up the radio and sang my heart out for the next 7+ hours. One song, The Proof of Your Love by for King and Country, hit me especially hard. It talks about the importance of love, and that without it, it doesn't really matter what you believe, say, or do. I decided to add it to my every morning AT playlist so maybe that message will be driven deep inside my brain over the next several months. At noon I stopped to refuel and grab a quick lunch at a gas station. Oddly, the thing I craved the most was cereal, so I got some sugar pops, a quart of milk, a pint of orange juice, and a banana.The closer I got to Birmingham, the more excited I became about seeing and surprising Lil Jan. About 10 minutes out, I picked up Starbucks coffee for her, my friend Brad, and myself. Just before entering the driveway, I texted Lil Jan to tell her I missed her and that I hoped she was having a good day. Right after she responded, I came walking through the basement door where she, Brad, and Jenny were working on wedding signs. I asked, ""Did someone order coffee?"" and she looked up in shock and came running over to hug me. Surprising her with something that makes her happy is one of the greatest joys in my life. It was so great to see her and the Diamond family, who kept my early arrival a surprise. The only downside was that she wasn't in the yellow, springy, reunion dress, but she still looked amazing!Days 60-66 - Wedding WeekThe entire week, with one exception, could not have gone more perfectly. We had a great, informal pasta dinner with the wedding party at Wes and Melissa Self's home on Thursday night. It was refreshing to sit among people who were clean, smelled good, and peed indoors. I had to really focus on eating slowly, using utensils, and not doing anything socially inappropriate. After dinner, against my better foot-resting judgement, I went outside to play knock-out basketball with the fellas. As I went for a rebound, a long distance shot ricocheted off the backboard and smacked me in my face, breaking my glasses and scratching my face. Lately, it seems I'm in the most danger when I'm off the trail, not on it! Fortunately, Wal-Mart was able to repair my glasses the next day.On the health, hygiene and appearance front, Lil Jan and I, with the help of mediators, agreed that I would get a haircut and ""clean up"" my beard a bit, but not make it go away. That was a win from my perspective, although the beard mice didn't like being disturbed. Another win was getting a 50-minute, deep tissue massage from a local spa, with the masseuse focusing on my feet, legs, and shoulders.The Mexican-themed rehearsal dinner on Friday night went really well. I appreciate all the work put in by Lil Jan and her helpers to make it a fun, festive, and filling evening. It was so great to spend time with so many family and friends. They had plenty of questions and comments about my AT hike so far. The slide show video we put together to honor Kyle and Laci went over well. Jason, my eldest son, gave a terrific Best Man speech that not only roasted Kyle, but offered some on-target marriage advice. Olivia, Kyle's ex-girlfriend and the Maid of Honor (weird, huh?) also delivered a sweet, heartfelt speech. The amazing Diamond family singers sang a song that I wrote, My Favorite Trail Things, along with a song of blessing for the bride and groom. It was a wonderful evening with love bubbling over between two families, friends, and the wedding party.A few other highlights of the week included hanging a wedding poem (a series of wooden signs on posts) at the wedding venue with Scott (my brother-in-law), going to a local town festival with family and friends, and playing poker with Brad Diamond, Kyle and Jason, and the other groomsmen until late in the evening. I was thoroughly enjoying this extended time on the mountaintop!The wedding itself was magnificent in every way possible. In Laci, Kyle has found himself a Christian wife, beautiful on the inside and out. Her parents have modeled a Christian marriage for her and others, and she has three terrific brothers who have welcomed Kyle in and think she hung the moon. This is an answer to many prayers by Janet and me going back decades. The wedding venue, featuring mature trees, ponds, rolling hills, a lodge and barn, provided a perfect setting. The weather cooperated and even featured a nice breeze. Mark Adams, who hired them both as youth interns years ago (where they developed feelings for each other) officiated and did a wonderful job. This young couple is so in love and you could just feel that in everything said and done. In a society where Biblical purity, saving oneself until marriage, is scoffed at and considered unrealistic, this couple stayed true to their values and pulled it off. I'm proud of them for that, and the commitment they made before God to be faithful to each other and Him for the rest of their lives.The wedding reception was so much fun! There was food, dancing, conversation, and lots of celebration. The venue owner commented that she had never seen such a wildly fun night that didn't involve alcohol. Interesting observation. I opted for more conversation than dancing, as my feet were still tender, yet improving. I had some really encouraging and motivating conversations about the trail, my blog, and hopefully future book with several people I'd never met before. It's just weird to think that something I wrote alone atop an AT mountain can impact someone thousands of miles away.On Monday, I said my farewells, kissed my wife, and drove back to the trail rested, restored, and rejuvenated. As previously planned, I made the switch from my Oboz Sawtooth hiking boots to Salomon XA Pro 3D trail running shoes. These would be lighter, quicker drying, and more agile, while giving up some stability in return. I was anxious to try them out in AT conditions. That night I also laid out all my clothes and tent and sprayed them with Permethrin, an insecticide that not only repels but kills ticks, mosquitos, chiggers, and other insects. After spraying them inside my motel room, I noticed the instructions said to do the spraying outside. So I went to bed that night on a bit of a Permethrin high, assured that any bugs in my ears, nose, and mouth had been decimated.I was in a good place mentally and physically, and it was time to get back on the trail and continue my journey to Katahdin.Fob","Pearisburg, VA

PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537038,"""What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value."" - Thomas PaineDay 67With more rain in the forecast, I decided to start the day wearing my new Salomon XA Pro 3D trail shoes without any socks. They worked like a champ right out of the gate, easily handling the climbs, mud puddles, and rocks. As I climbed the first hill out of Pearisburg, I passed a hiker who asked for my trail name. I told him the whole 3-minute story of how Sir Fob W. Pot came to be. I asked him about his trail name, Stan. He said his parents gave him that name when he was born and it stuck. I wasn't sure if that was a joke or not so I half-laughed to cover my bases.As I approached the Rice Field Shelter at noon, the Virginia skies opened up and the rain began to fall. I ducked into the shelter along with Cambria, Two Souls, Blade, a German Shepherd, and several others. I started eating a Slim Jim which caused the dog to jump up into the shelter, get all in my face, and start drooling. I gave her half a Slim Jim, overly generous by hiker standards, and she licked me on the mouth. That seemed like a fair exchange. Once the rain lightened up, I headed back out and continued along fairly level terrain. While climbing Dickinson Gap, I saw and spoke briefly with Princess Grit and she asked me to tell the story of my trail name to a hiker she was with. I've told the story so many times that I think it's time to start changing it up. I may have B.W. Pot be on different trails and amusement parks around the world, defiling them at various times of day, even with people watching. Sorry in advance, Kyle.A short time later, after a 15.9 mile day, I stopped for the night and stealth camped among some tall trees at mile 650.1. My new trail shoes had passed their first test, even without socks. Still, I plan to wear socks on most non-super rainy, non-stream fording days as that makes the shoes a tad more comfortable. Despite the mud splashes from my knees to ankles, it had been a good, mostly rainy day on the AT.Fob","Pearisburg, VA

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537041,"Day 68Today was dark and cloudy the first half of the day. I spoke briefly with Sasquatch, a southbounder, at Stony Creek Valley. I thought he'd be taller and hairier. In the early afternoon, the rain started falling again, and would continue off and on the rest of the day. About a mile after Bailey Gap Shelter, I hit a several mile long section of really rocky terrain. I had to concentrate on each step to keep from rolling an ankle. The rocks and mud slowed my pace considerably.After a 16.7 mile day, I camped with Two Souls, Grit, and others near the War Spur Shelter. The talk around camp centered on the tremendous amount of rain we'd experienced in Virginia so far. Someone said they talked to an elderly local man who said it was the rainiest month of May he could remember in the past 80 years. I was once again asked about my trail name and told a story about the time Kyle, a third grader at the time, pooped himself on the Runaway Mine Train at Six Flags over Georgia. I felt a bit regretful later over this fabrication, but that should subside with each false re-telling of the story.Fob","Stealth Camp near Mile 650.1

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537042,"Day 69The climb up to Kelly Knob was brutal this morning. I climbed nearly 2000 feet over a little more than 2 miles. It wasn't raining, but the terrain was muddy from all the previous rain, and the vegetation I frequently brush up against was wet. All that plus the humidity and my profuse sweating led to one soaked, muddy hiker by 9 a.m. As I guzzled a full liter of water and caught my breath at the summit, two deer darted by off to my right, a small reward for a tough start to the day.At mile 676.3 I passed Keffer Oak, an 18' around, 300-year-old oak tree. It's the largest AT oak tree in the South, with Dover Oak along the AT in New York being slightly larger. I thought to myself, if that 300-year-old tree could talk...well, that'd be really weird.A little while later, on a rock scramble near Sarver Hollow Shelter, I met a hiker named Crisco. Before starting the AT, most hikers are aware that it's not possible to replenish the 5000-6000 calories you burn on a typical day. It's simply tough to carry that much food because food is heavy. Well, Crisco took that as a challenge and began the trail carrying and consuming pure Crisco vegetable shortening which provides 110 calories of pure fat per tablespoon eaten. Thus, the trail name. So if he carries and consumes three cups of Crisco, he's getting...well, I really don't want to do that math.At mile 682.3, the north end of the ridge crest on Sinking Creek Mountain, I arrived at a sign marking the Eastern Continental Divide. Curious, I decided to conduct an experiment by relieving myself on a large boulder near the sign. Sure enough, the flow went evenly in each direction down the sides of the boulder. I plan to contact a scientific journal in order to publish my findings. If they like my work, I may replicate the experiment on the Runaway Mine Train at Six Flags.I finished this 18.2 mile day sleeping in the Niday Shelter at mile 685. Joining me in and around the shelter were several hikers, including Tennessee Troy, Little Bear, Patrice, Crisco, Sprinkle Toes, ETA, Future Dad, and White Owl. We covered a lot of ground in the camp conversation that evening. First, Little Bear, who you may recall is helping Lindsay and Patrice film a movie/documentary about women thru-hikers, informed me that Lindsay had to get off the trail to have surgery. She hopes to return and will continue with film editing and such while she recovers.As for Sprinkle Toes, she earned that name during a cold, very windy afternoon in the Smokies. As she relieved herself behind a tree, she didn't realize the wind was blowing her pee all over her left shoe and sock. She ended up with a pee-soaked sock and a trail name.And that brings us to the fascinating, 70-year-old White Owl from Maine. We immediately hit it off and began trading stories. He has a great sense of humor and looks like my Uncle Phil's twin brother. He recently saw two crawdads trying to eat a fish that was being digested by a snake. That's awesome! He shared a picture he snapped after the crawdads scurried away. We also traded vasectomy and colonoscopy stories, much to the delight of the younger hikers around us who are just a few years removed from puberty. I don't remember all the details from his colonoscopy story (a good thing) but his last sentence was, ""And then, after raising my bare butt up in the air, the nurse looked at me and said, 'That's where I remember you from!'""Fob","War Spur Shelter

PotThe LORD is my Sherpa, my Leader, my Model, my Defender and my Protector. He hikes out in front of me, showing me the path to follow to reach the finish line and the crown that awaits. He hikes behind me, nudging and encouraging me to stay focused and to take it one step at a time. He walks beside me, as a friend, and we talk things out, like good friends do. He surrounds me with Trail Angels, both seen and unseen. I don't want Him on my team; rather, I am on His team...a team that has already defeated Satan and this fallen world.With Christ as my LORD, I have all that I need and many of the things I want. I trust that I'm better off without some of the things I want, as they might distract me from more godly pursuits. I need to keep my focus on Him, not the temporary trappings of this world.Each and every evening, there is a safe place to lay my head. I may set up my tent in a green pasture or on a rocky mountaintop. Or perhaps I'll find myself in a shelter, a hiker hostel, a hotel, a friend's home, or even the loft of a barn. I may be alone or surrounded by others. It may be snowy, rainy, or sunny. Regardless, without fail, every night I am eventually safe, dry, and warm, and I thank God for that.God has provided life-giving water. Sometimes the water is fast moving, a place to get good drinking water. Sometimes it is a hot shower, a place to wash my tired, dirty body. Sometimes the waters are calm, a place to fish, soak my feet, or just sit and reflect on this marvelous world He has created. I have been thirsty, but never for long. I have been hungry, but have never run out of food. God sustains me.Each morning, I'm renewed and restored. I feel the prayers of family and friends that have been lifted up for me and my fellow hikers. I feel a sense of purpose that goes beyond just hiking miles. He has put me on this earth, and this amazing trail, with a mission in mind. Perhaps I can help someone to see that this incredible beauty and amazing design around us is the result not of chance, but the work of an amazing Designer. Perhaps today I can encourage someone with a kind word or good deed. Or maybe today I will be the one needing encouragement. Regardless, God will fill my soul today as only He can.He leads me on the right, true path, because that path leads to Heaven, my final summit. Katahdin is a goal, a dream, and I hope to get there. But it is an earthly pursuit, with only temporal benefits. If I fail, so be it...most do. But Heaven! Majestic, glorious Heaven! May I always strive to follow His Holy Word, the Bible, as it provides the path, the white blazes if you will, that lead to that final golden summit and an eternity with Him! God's Word teaches, comforts, instructs, rebukes, and challenges me. May I take its messages to heart and encourage those around me to follow it as well.Even though I hike in and through some dangerous conditions...lightning storms, heavy rain, freezing temperatures, and searing heat...with bears, snakes, and ticks posing potential trouble, I'm not afraid of ANY of those things. God has my back. He comforts me. He calms me. He protects me. His Holy Spirit lives and moves and works within me. He'll bring me home to heaven when He is good and ready and not one moment sooner. Even if tragedy were to strike me, do not worry about me, friends. All is well with me and will remain well with me. My future is secure.There are a few enemies out here on the trail, or at least scoffers, who doubt my faith, reject God's Word, and on occasion put temptations before me. God is there even then...especially then. He picks me up and dusts me off and forgives me when I fail.God provides spray to prevent insect bites, ointment for scratches, sunscreen for protection, and bandages for blisters. Like His Word, they must be applied to be effective. I have all that I need, and then some, thanks to God.As He has watched over me in the past and now on the Appalachian Trail, my hope and assurance is that He will be with me until the very end. I have experienced and benefitted from His goodness my whole life. He has shown mercy to me as a sinner in need of grace. I am sad that Christ so willingly paid my debt, but I am oh so thankful for it. May I show that appreciation in the way I live my life and treat others, even here on the trail.And some day soon, may Christ return and bring me home, along with other Christians who have staked our hope and future and eternity on Him. We want nothing more or less than to live forever, together, in the home Christ has prepared for us. Come quickly, Lord Jesus!Fob","Niday Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537865,"""We never repent of having eaten too little.""    - Thomas Jefferson, 1825Day 70I hit the trail, crossed several footbridges, and began the climb up Brush Mountain. At the summit was a wooden bench, which is uncommon and highly appreciated on the AT. Along the Brush Mountain ridge line, at mile 690.1, I took a short side trail to the Audie Murphy monument. Murphy was the most decorated American soldier of World War II. After the war, he acted in movies for over twenty years and eventually got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On May 28, 1971, Murphy died when the private plane he was in crashed near the monument in his honor on Brush Mountain. He was 45 years old. I stopped to pay my respects to this hero, a great soldier from what has been called the greatest generation.As morning turned to afternoon, I set my sights on the famous Dragons Tooth. Like Albert Mountain, Jacobs Ladder, and other notable trail challenges, it has a reputation for being a very tough climb with rewarding views. The climb to it wasn't steep, but was long and extremely rocky. I eventually arrived and was impressed with it and the views from it. I also thought it was a bit over-rated in terms of level of difficulty. It was tough, but not super tough. And then came the descent, and I realized what other hikers were talking about and where Dragons Tooth's reputation comes from. It was very tricky, especially as light rain began to fall. I had to scramble down and around rocks using both hands, at one point passing the 700 mile marker on my journey. In a few spots I had to slide down rocks on my rear. In other places, metal rungs were inserted in rocks to provide a foothold. It reminded me, on a smaller scale, of some of the rock scrambles I've heard about in New Hampshire and Maine.At the bottom of the mountain, at Newport Road, after a 16.8-mile day, I decided to hike .3 miles east and stay at the Four Pines Hostel. The lodging is a 3-bay garage with shower (no towels), along with a separate barn with sleeping platforms. There's no fee but they accept donations. The place was packed when I arrived, with people on cots, couches, and the floor...playing cards, drinking beer, eating, checking each other for ticks, sharing stories, napping, picking at their feet, and airing out tents and clothes. It reminded me of the kind of place where Charles Manson would have recruited. I managed to find a recliner that wasn't yet taken, next to a couch occupied by a sweet lady hiker in her mid-60s with the trail named Gamel. That's a combination of ""Georgia (GA) to Maine (ME)"" and her nickname, Mel, which is short for Melanie. She is from East Tennessee and filled me in on the towns and things to do there, as it is a region where Lil Jan and I have discussed putting down roots someday. I also met the owner, Joe Mitchell, and his wife handed me some sort of brownie/cookie dessert that was delicious.The highlight of the evening, though, was set in motion moments later when the shuttle driver asked if anyone wanted to go to the all-you-can-eat, family style Homeplace Restaurant. Uhhh...yeah!!! Certain words and phrases excite hikers, and can even cause frenzies when we're in groups. The list includes...- All You Can Eat- Trail Magic- REI Sale- Hot Shower- Reliable Spring- Free WiFi- Free {fill in the blank}- Easy Hitch- Flat Terrain- Milkshake- Ramen Bomb- Summit- Campfire- Hot Tub or Hot Bath- Trail Legs- Outfitter- Buffet- Zero Day- KatahdinMy personal list would also include...- Lil Jan- Yellow, springy dress- Outback- Mountain Dew- Darn Good Chili- Gold BondA gaggle of hikers piled in the large van and a truck and headed to the Homeplace. One hiker was on the floorboard and two were in the trunk. It felt like a prison work crew, only smellier. Upon arrival, eleven of us were seated at one table, including three other Air Force veterans (sponsored by a program called Warrior Hike) and four Marines. It was probably the most heavily defended restaurant table in Catawba that evening. We were a scraggly, hairy bunch, and most of us had not yet showered or eaten.What happened next will go down as one of the most prolific displays of eating in American history. The sweet country waitress brought out the initial round of roast beef, chicken, ham, mac n cheese, pinto beans, green beans, mashed potatoes, biscuits, and cole slaw. She told us to let her know when we wanted seconds on anything. I pulled her aside and said, ""Ma'am, we haven't eaten in like three hours. You'll want to go ahead and get started on seconds and thirds now."" We were like vultures at a fresh highway roadkill. The large bowl of pinto beans was passed around, and was empty by the third person. As the ranking military guy at the table, I didn't pass the mac n cheese at all. Instead, I selfishly made the family-style bowl my personal bowl. What good is it to make rank if you can't leverage it for a private bowl of mac n cheese on the AT?The Marines were sucking on chicken bones and then piling them up in a mass grave at the center of the table, as grease ran down their chins and hands. The former Air Force TACP (Tactical Air Control Party specialist, aka a special ops guy) sitting next to me had nine helpings of roast beef, six pieces of chicken, and four large pieces of ham. I started to ask him if this was his first time eating. I also looked under the table by his feet to see if it was coming out the other end. Each time the waitress came by, we were out of something and ready for more. Each time, I would point at TAC-P and tell her, ""And he'll need some more roast beef."" He would then grunt and nod his head, too busy eating to speak. It was the least I could do for a special ops guy with the most epic trail beard to date.There was very little table conversation as we were too busy stuffing our faces and asking for more, as if our very survival depended on it. The whole spectacle was fun to watch and more than a little embarrassing. Later, the waitress, in perhaps the most unnecessary question of the evening, asked if we'd like some peach cobbler with ice cream. I said, ""We would, please, with coffee, and my friend TAC-P here would like his cobbler with just a couple more slices of roast beef."" TAC-P looked up, nodded, and grunted...and for just a moment, all was right in our hiker universe.Sir Fob","Niday Shelter

Without backpacks, they were rushing to do 27 miles to Troutville where the shuttle driver would pick them up, return them to the hostel, and then return them to Troutville the following morning. As previously discussed, I don't slack pack as a matter of principle. The AT is meant to be enjoyed, not rushed, and that was especially true of this section of trail.Around noon I stopped at Catawba Mountain Shelter to get water. While there, I met and got information on the trail ahead from Matt, a friendly and helpful ridge runner. An hour later, I was standing on McAfee Knob, the most famous ledge and among the top two most photographed spots on the AT. I have been reading about this ledge and looking at hiker photos on it for more than two decades. This is the ledge Robert Redford and Nick Nolte are standing on in the movie poster for A Walk in the Woods (a photo-shopped picture as neither actor has been to this spot). It all felt a little surreal. I waited my turn for a photo and then a young man named Terrence took several pictures of me on the ledge. It was cloudy out so there was limited visibility, but even the clouds provided a neat backdrop for this iconic spot. The final few pictures involved me sitting on the edge of the ledge, the scariest thing I've done since climbing the Shuckstack fire tower in the Smokies. It was another medium sized step in overcoming my fear of heights.At Campbell Shelter, I stopped for water and met some young Tennessee Volunteer fans out on a section hike. Towards the end of the day, as storms once again threatened, I made a final climb to the stunningly beautiful views from Tinker Cliffs, passing ETA, Training Wheels, and their tents. (She earned that name after falling down several times during the first two weeks of her hike, including once just walking by a campfire.) Apparently Revolutionary War deserters hid out at Tinker Cliffs repairing pots and pans for money and acquired the name ""tinkers."" The trail follows right along the edge with drops of 150 feet. It was a perfect spot for tenting with a view, so I called it a day after 14.9 miles. I cooked some Ramen Bomb on a large, flat rock on the edge of the cliffs. As I dozed off to sleep, I wondered what it must have been like to live up there as a war deserter, repairing pots and pans, while others were down below fighting for independence and the creation of a new nation.Fob","Four Pines Hostel

In fact, the hike from McAfee Knob (yesterday, mile 711.4) to today's Hay Rock (mile 723.5) comes in at 4th place, so far, on my favorite sections of the trail. There were at least five scenic overlooks with views stretching for miles. Having exhausted most of my water supply up on the cliffs, I stopped at Lamberts Meadow Shelter to get more. This was yet another shelter that had been closed indefinitely due to bear activity. As I filtered my water a little faster than normal, I had my head on a swivel in anticipation of a bear arriving and going all Revenant on me.Of the 10.8 miles hiked today, the final few into Daleville/Roanoke were scenic and relatively flat. I was looking forward to getting there because the plan was for Debbie Freeman, a longtime family friend, to pick me up and treat me to some southern hospitality. Long ago, my family got to know the Smyth family (Debbie's maiden name) through the school friendship between Debbie and my oldest sister, Ellen. My mom and Debbie's mom also became close friends and kept in contact for over forty years. My first memory of the Smyth family was as an 8-year-old, in 1974, when my family returned from our military assignment to Germany. Before moving into our home in Dover, Delaware, we stayed with their family in a big home out in the country. My main memories are of a house full of cute girls of various ages, a bumper pool table that I was allowed to play, and a rope swing. I love this country! Their dad was a newspaper editor and I remember him constantly sitting in his big chair with a newspaper and pen to mark it up. Their family was very kind to us, and it's interesting that 42 years later, Debbie and her husband Bill would once again show hospitality to a tired long distance hiker like me.The first treat was seeing and learning about her latest hobby, beekeeping. I learned the ins and outs of starting and maintaining a hive and the role of each type of bee. The magnificence of their design, roles, and coordinated effort to survive once again pointed to a Grand Designer. It was all fascinating and now I'm thinking about getting Lil Jan a beehive starter kit for her birthday. If I ask for her permission, I bet she'd say, ""No honey.""After starting my laundry, I headed straight for a shower and bath. Debbie provided me with muscle-soothing Epsom salt and lavender bath oil. I had never had a bath with an essential oil before (or even a nonessential oil) and it was luxurious! I laid back, took a deep breath and closed my eyes, and all was right in the universe. I imagined snapping my fingers and having two eunuchs in togas enter, one holding a platter with grapes and cheeses and the other a cold Mountain Dew. I snapped back to reality, put on Bill's bathrobe, and headed down to supper feeling like a million dollars. Debbie prepared a scrumptious meal featuring chicken, asparagus, bread, and more! It was so, so good. It was great catching up on what our respective family members have been up to.Fob","Tinker Cliffs

She then returned me to Daleville and the trailhead. She and Bill were excellent hosts and I truly appreciate their kindness to me. After eating some pasta and salad from Pizza Hut, I got back on the trail at 2:15 p.m.The rest of the day was uneventful. I hiked 11.2 miles and then tented near the Wilson Creek Shelter along with several other hikers. It was good to see and chat with Gamel again, and also to meet Tree from Indiana. He received that name from fellow hikers after knowing and sharing too much information about AT trees while under the influence of something.As I dozed off to sleep about 9:00 p.m., I caught a final faint whiff of lavender and then it was gone forever.Fob","Roanoke, VA

If your dreams do not scare you, they are not big enough."" - Ellen Johnson SirleafDay 74Just a few miles into the hike this morning, I saw the first of what would be many views and crossings of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Given the beauty and popularity of that road, I was surprised not to hear or see any traffic on it. I would learn later that they occasionally shut down sections of it to trim branches or do maintenance on it.The Virginia rains that I had become accustomed to had been replaced by high humidity and oppressive heat. Sweat was pouring off of me at an alarming rate. I decided to take my shirt off, which didn't cool me off much, but did provide a scary sight for southbound hikers. The hotter it got, the more motivated I became to reach today's big goal...Jennings Creek! Two words in my AT guidebook drew me like a magnet to the creek: ""swimming hole.""I crossed over the VA 614 bridge and arrived at Jennings Creek by 4:15 p.m. As two male hikers eating lunch on a large creekside boulder watched in amusement, I stripped down to my synthetic, quick drying underwear and waded out into the frigid waters. Once I got over the initial shock of the cold water and caught my breath, it was a wonderfully refreshing moment. I swam out to the whirlpool and fobbed up and down like a manatee playing in a tidal pool. I eventually waded over to a large boulder and stretched out across it to nap and dry out. Later, as I waded back to shore, I caught a large crawfish, named him Cajun, and looked for another in order to have a crawfish duel. I couldn't find another so he remained the Jennings Creek champ, uncontested and undefeated. As you might suspect, the next item on the agenda was fishing. Unfortunately, I was shut out, moving my record versus AT fish to 2-1. I think they might have been spooked by my earlier frolicking in synthetic, quick drying underwear. As I walked a few yards from the creek, I spotted and got a picture of a bird's nest, a final gift from this excellent AT watering hole.Refreshed, I felt like hiking a while longer, so I did. Five minutes into my ascent up Fork Mountain, I saw a 6' long black snake (#8) right on the trail. Knowing they can bite but are non-venomous, I reached out and grabbed his tail and he spun around. I chose to show him mercy and not make a belt out of him.After a 20.8 mile day, I stopped at a deep ravine and stayed in the large, 20-person Bryant Ridge Shelter, along with Tree, Big Stick, and several others. One hiker about my age, while going down 15 or so steps to the water source, lost his balance and wiped out. All the other hikers, myself included, started laughing out loud at his misfortune. Then we went over to the bushes to check on him and confirm that he wasn't injured. We probably should have checked on him before laughing.Fob","Wilson Creek Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538467,"Day 75Today was a really tough day of hiking. First of all, it was unbelievably hot and humid, and there were no swimming holes to provide relief. Second, the morning featured a 3000-foot climb and the afternoon featured a 2000-foot descent. All day there was almost no flat terrain to catch a breather. Third, I awoke with a small outbreak of poison ivy on my right forearm, which served me right for laughing at the hiker who fell yesterday. I'm very susceptible to getting poison ivy, so I'm surprised my first bout on the trail didn't happen until 75 days in. Fortunately I have my trail legs and there were plenty of water sources, so I just drank a lot, powered through the climbs and descents, and tried to ignore the poison ivy.Today's top man-made sight was a large Federal Aviation Administration tower/facility at the top of Apple Orchard Mountain. Less than half a mile later, I hiked under The Guillotine, a large boulder hanging right over the trail between two even larger boulders. After passing the Thunder Hill Shelter, which was closed indefinitely due to bear activity, I saw snake #9, a harmless fellow about a foot long.After a hot, exhausting 17.1 mile day, I tent camped at Marble Spring along with Big Stick, Smiley (epic snorer), and David and Sarah from DC. I also met Tree Beard (who has a long beard in a pony tail) and Waterfall (who fell earlier on his journey while trying to position himself higher up on a waterfall).The story being told around the campfire that evening was that an aggressive bear had been harassing hikers at the Thunder Hill Shelter. The bear also knew how to knock most bear bags down and one evening helped himself to several bags of hiker food. Then the bear followed/stalked a group of hikers from the shelter down to the Harrison Ground Spring camping area. Once that was reported to authorities, the bear had to be put down near Petites Gap. I can't confirm whether all the details of that story are actually true, but it was certainly the talk around the campfire that night. There was also a rumor that a male model was posing in his underwear for a GQ photo shoot at Jennings Creek. I don't know where all these crazy rumors come from.Fob","Bryant Ridge Shelter

It reaches into where I cannot hide, setting my feet upon the road.""    - Kyrie, by Mr. Mister, 1985Day 76For 4-year-old Ottie Cline Powell, November 9, 1890, began as a typical day. The 5th of Edwin and Emma Belle Powell's eight children, little Ottie awoke, got dressed, and headed out with his siblings to the one room schoolhouse near his family's farm. It was a chilly, overcast day in Amherst County, Virginia. A few inches of snow had fallen the week prior.Upon his arrival at the Tower Hill schoolhouse, his teacher, Miss Nancy Gilbert, probably welcomed little Ottie, an intelligent young man with blue eyes and a fair complexion. She also noticed that she had used up her supply of firewood during the recent snow. During recess, she instructed her students to return with some sticks to fuel the school's wood-burning stove. Little Ottie, barefoot at the time, went looking for wood, wandered off, and didn't return. Miss Gilbert couldn't find him and became increasingly concerned. She sent her students home with instructions to tell their parents that little Ottie was missing. More than 1500 locals and several dogs began searching for him, in the rain and then ice, in ever-widening circles. ""Ottie! Ottie Powell! Where are you? Come here, Ottie!"" There was no sign of him. The entire community was baffled by his disappearance and his parents were heartbroken.When I was young I thought of growing old, of what my life would mean to me. Would I have followed down my chosen road? Or only wished that I could be? On April 5, 1891, nearly five months later, a hunting dog picked up a scent and led a hunter up an old hunting and Indian trail to the top of Bluff Mountain. It was there, seven miles from the schoolhouse, at 3372 feet, that little Ottie's remains were found. Experts believe he got lost, panicked, and started to run. After climbing the mountain, he collapsed and succumbed to the freezing temperatures. An autopsy showed he had undigested chestnuts from school in his stomach, an indication that, thankfully, he didn't suffer for long.On Day 76, I made the long descent from Highcock Knob and crossed the James River footbridge, the longest foot-use only bridge on the AT. I then began the exhausting, very difficult, 2700-foot climb up Bluff Mountain. It would turn out to be the toughest climb for me in Virginia, partly due to the humidity and partly because there were no water sources and I carried a woefully inadequate two liters of water. I eventually arrived at the summit, completely drained and soaked to the bone with sweat.My heart is old, it holds my memories. My body burns a gemlike flame. Somewhere between the soul and soft machine, is where I find myself again.At the summit I looked over and saw the memorial to Ottie Cline Powell, placed on the spot where his body was found over 125 years ago. A lot of emotions ran through my mind. First, I felt sad for little Ottie, and imagined the despair and panic he likely felt as he ran and ran and yet couldn't find his schoolhouse. I so wished there wasn't a 125 year gap between our Bluff Mountain summits, so that I could have rescued that little boy. Second, I was amazed that such a young boy, just one month shy of his 5th birthday, in his bare feet, in those conditions, could have traveled seven miles, much of it uphill in rugged wilderness. That is simply remarkable. Finally, I felt thankful that it was likely he didn't suffer for long up on that mountain. I'm also thankful that he's in heaven now. Perhaps someday I will meet little Ottie and give him a fist pump, the standard greeting between long distance hikers.Kyrie eleison down the road that I must travel, Kyrie eleison through the darkness of the night, Kyrie eleison where I'm going will you follow? Kyrie eleison on a highway in the light.I descended Bluff Mountain and arrived at Punchbowl Shelter after a physically grueling 18.2 mile day. The first priority at camp was to filter and consume nearly 2 liters of water. I was clearly dehydrated. The second priority was to retrieve my fishing gear and try to catch a fish at the nearby mountain pond. I got some nibbles but ultimately struck out, bringing my record versus AT fish to 2-2. I then ate dinner at the shelter picnic table, along with Training Wheels, Shoe Leather, Big Stick, and Uno. One of them, reading from the shelter journal, informed us that the shelter was reportedly haunted by the ghost of Ottie Cline Powell. Someone else said the ghost was probably carrying firewood. Too soon.Since a light rain started to fall toward the tail end of supper, and I hadn't yet set up my tent, I decided to sleep in the shelter. I was joined in the shelter by Shoe Leather (a south bounder) and Uno. This would turn out to be one of the worst decisions I've made so far on the trail. As I settled into my sleeping bag about 9:00 p.m., the bugs descended on Punchbowl Shelter. First came the mosquitos. I could hear them loudly buzzing my ears. Each time they came close, I slapped myself in an attempt to kill them. I probably slapped myself upside the head 25 times between 9:00 and 9:30. I didn't kill any mosquitos but gave myself a slight concussion. Next came the black flies. I hate black flies with a passion. They targeted my arms, already in bad shape from poison ivy. I was miserable and fighting a losing battle. My only option was to pull my sleeping bag liner up and over my head. This technique kept the bugs at bay, but also meant sleeping in a 100 degree, sweat-filled cocoon. It was easily my worst night on the AT. I might have slept an hour. I told myself to never again sleep in a shelter, especially one near a bug-producing pond. If I could live that night over again, I would have summoned the ghost of Ottie Cline Powell and had him club me over the head with a piece of firewood to put an end to my misery.Kyrie eleison down the road that I must travel, Kyrie eleison through the darkness of the night, Kyrie eleison where I'm going will you follow?

I was also glad that today would be a short day, just 11.3 miles, as I was heading to Buena Vista to shower, do laundry, and resupply.After crossing the Pedlar River Bridge, I crossed the AT 800 mile marker, spelled out in sticks. While on the surface insignificant in the context of a 2189.1 mile journey, I have come to appreciate these little milestone markers. They are good opportunities to pray, eat a candy bar, reflect on the progress made, and consider the physical and mental work that remains. Whether you've embarked on a goal to write a book, lose some weight, raise a child, or hike a trail, I'd suggest breaking it up into a series of smaller pieces and celebrating each one of them. I'm not sure I can hike 2200 miles, but I might be able to hike 100 miles 22 times.Shortly after crossing the 800-mile marker, I approached a historical sign with a bench next to it. The sign informed hikers that the next 1.4 mile section of trail featured the remains of the Brown Mountain Creek community. In the early 1900s, freed slaves built and lived in this community. They worked hard, lived in small homes, and ate simple but nourishing food. Living as sharecroppers, they raised tobacco, corn, wheat, and oats. It was a simple life and, most importantly, they were free. The community disbanded when they sold their land to the National Forest Service in the early 1920s. I didn't see any remnants of their community as I passed through, although it was overcast and fairly dark in the woods and I wasn't sure exactly what I was looking for.I emerged from the woods at a parking lot on US 60, 9.3 miles east of Buena Vista. I tried hitchhiking for 15 minutes, but all 50 or so cars and trucks passed by. It wasn't a great first impression of the town, but then again I was a smelly, sweaty male hiker so I can understand the reluctance. Tired of waiting, I called a shuttle service and 45 minutes and $15 later, I finally arrived at the Budget Inn. I was so hungry that I chose Burger King (across the street) over a shower, which doesn't happen often. I managed to spend $16 at Burger King, eating a variety of food from each section of the large overhead menu. I stepped outside, belched loudly, and smelled myself. It was quite possible I was the most disgusting living thing in Virginia that afternoon.After showering and doing laundry, I walked up the road to re-supply at the Family Dollar and the Amish Cupboard, which has a variety of canned and dried foods, jerky, etc. I then ate some excellent Mexican food for supper at Don Tequilas. After dropping my stuff off at the hotel, I walked next door and finished off the day with some shaved ice.Fob","Punchbowl Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538983,"Day 78Job 1 today was to walk back downtown and be the first customer at the barber shop when they opened. The barber lady was very nice and quite interested in my hike. I told her to basically cut all my hair off but don't touch the beard, because it grows only one centimeter per year. She told me about the town, its economic struggles, and history of flooding. After the haircut, I ate a footlong sub at Subway and then walked up to the town intersection to try to get a hitch. This time it only took two minutes! Kara, a very kind lady in a convertible, pulled in and offered me a ride to the trailhead, restoring my faith in humanity.Given my late start, I only hiked 6.3 miles today, but half of that was up a fairly steep mountain to Bald Knob, which isn't. I tent camped at Hog Camp Gap, a sprawling grassy meadow, along with Gamel, Verge and Legs (really cool sisters), Pantry and his dog, Jelly and Peanut Butter (another dog), and several others. Pantry easily has the largest food bag on the AT this year, with a wide assortment of food, herbs, and spices.About 25 yards from us was an impressive encampment of Boys Scouts...specifically, BS Troop 27 out of Newport News. Just prior to sunset, Scoutmaster Tommy, their leader, walked down to us and said, ""Hey guys, we have plenty of leftover spaghetti and bread if you guys are interested."" We looked at each other, grinned from ear to ear, thanked him, wiped drool from our chins, and made our way up the trail to the Troop 27 encampment.

At mile 818.2 I crossed the north fork of the Piney River, an area one hiker accurately described as a Yoda marsh. Described, he did.I was initially surprised by the large number of day hikers on the trail today, and then I remembered it was Memorial Day weekend. I spoke with several of these clean, smiling people with Fannie packs and answered several questions about my hike. I also passed most of them on the uphills. This provided a small boost to my ego which had taken a hit earlier in my journey when I was passed by a woman and her wiener dog. Along with thirty other people, I stopped and scrambled up the scenic Sky Rock at mile 822.8.By mid-afternoon the rain started to fall. Rather than take on Virginia's steepest descent in the rain, I ended my 14.3 mile day at The Priest Shelter atop Priest Mountain. I was joined in and around the shelter by an assortment of hikers, including Hawaii, Clancy and his dog Findley, Spaghetti Legs, Gamel, and Pantry. The Priest is one of the more famous shelters along the AT because it is a tradition for hikers to write confessions to The Priest in the shelter log book. As the rain fell, I blew up my air mattress in the shelter, got out of my wet clothes, and began nibbling on and sharing the dried, salted green peas I'd purchased from the Amish Cupboard in Buena Vista. I started to wish there was an Amish Cupboard near my house, and then I remembered my house is on wheels and I can drive and live near an Amish store whenever I want.I spent the next hour reading confessions from the log and writing several of my own. Other hikers confessed to things like...- Not digging their cat holes 6 inches deep- Getting another hiker's Nalgene ""pee bottle"" out of a hiker box and using it as their drinking bottle for a month- Not liking certain other hikers...even hiding in the woods to avoid them- Not believing in God- Not having showered or brushed their teeth in several weeksI added my own dozen confessions, including...- Attempting to smell southbound women hikers as they pass by just in case they're wearing perfume- Never having voted for a Democrat, or anyone pro-choice, my entire life (actually proud of that)- Fishing without a license in various states along the AT- The only time I can recall cheating on a test was a music test in 8th grade at Caesar Rodney Junior High School. One of the questions was a series of musical notes written on the chalkboard, and we had to figure out the song. While the teacher stepped out of the room for a second, a fellow student hummed the tune and that gave me the answer. That's bothered me since 1978. I'm letting it go now.Later that evening, I had a good chat with Hawaii, a mid-20s guy from...well, you can figure it out. We began by torturing ourselves by naming the food we most crave. His number one craving was duck, a food introduced to him by his Chinese girlfriend. I went with the Victoria's Filet Mignon at Outback with the horseradish crust on it...with a Blooming Onion, bread and butter, a loaded baked potato, and salad. I'm counting that as one item...deal with it. We also discussed why, according to him, older people tend to complete the AT at a higher success rate than the younger, fitter crowd. His theory, and experience from hiking with many in their 20s, is that there are 3 main reasons:1. Younger hikers tend to let their egos go wild and make unwise decisions about mileage, causing injury. They go for too many miles, too soon, and their bodies don't play along. Older, wiser hikers generally have aged, less fit bodies to work with, and yet they know how to get more out of them without injury.2. Younger hikers tend to run out of money, and that is often the result of vast sums of money spent on beer in trail towns.3. Many (but not all) younger hikers begin the trail not having experienced many hardships in life. They may not have experienced the kind of physical and emotional challenges (serving in combat, dealing with loss or loneliness, etc.) that harden and toughen those who have. While I agree with Hawaii's perspective on this, there are certainly exceptions. I have met millennials out here who are as tough as nails, having survived domestic violence, horrific war wounds to the face, and other hardships much more daunting than anything I've been through.As I laid there in the shelter with rain falling outside, I thought of a few more confessions I should have made. I relieved myself too close to Ottie Cline Powell's memorial, and for that I am truly sorry. I also might have loudly spoke an inappropriate word when I landed on my back and elbow at Dismal Falls.Before dozing off to sleep, I coughed up a dried, salted Amish green pea onto Hawaii's air mattress. I must confess to reaching over, picking it up, putting it back in my mouth, chewing it some more, an then re-swallowing it. I'm not proud of what I did, but when it comes to confessions, I guess we rarely are.Fob","Hog Camp Gap

It was rocky and not easy, but I was better off than those climbing The Priest from the south. At the base, I crossed the Tye River suspension bridge and then reversed the process, climbing 3000 feet over six miles. Whoever said the AT in Virginia is flat has never hiked the AT in Virginia.Halfway up the mountain, I caught Gamel and the two of us got water and finished off my dried, salted Amish peas at the Harpers Creek Shelter. She is a very sweet, East Tennessee lady in her mid-60s who lost her husband to cancer not long ago. I told her I was proud of her for being out here doing what she's doing. Her face lit up and she said, ""Thanks, Fob, you are the first person to tell me that!"" It was a reminder to me that taking just a few seconds to recognize someone and show appreciation can really give them a lift. I have been on the receiving end of such kindness from family, friends, blog readers, etc., but need to make more of an effort to be a giver of such kindness. As I got ready to leave, a young, section hiking couple from Sterling, Virginia arrived to feed their infant, who was riding on her mom's back. Future AT thru-hiker there, I bet.Our long climb to the top was rewarded with a spectacular view from Hanging Rock Overlook. I met another young couple there on a weekend section hike. I agreed to take their picture but declined their offer of a beer. Speaking of beer, Gamel and several other hikers decided to get off the trail at Reeds Gap and go to a nearby brewery for dinner and to camp. I decided to press on, and ended the 17.3-mile day camping alone at mile 844.After a tortilla with hard salami and sharp cheddar cheese supper, I felt a pain and sharp rumbling in my stomach. I mostly blame the Amish and their dried peas for this. Nature was calling and I was the only hiker around to answer. I rarely have to do my business in the woods these days, as I can usually can wait to get to a privy, hostel, or trail town. There would be no waiting tonight. I grabbed my toilet paper and quickly travelled around some bushes and found a nice, secluded tree about 20 yards off the trail. I dropped my shorts and underwear down around my ankles and assumed the 90 degree position with my back up against the tree. With my recent weight loss, and trail legs firmly under me, I can stay in that position for as long as I need to...even overnight.About mid-movement, I just happened to glance down and, to my horror, noticed that my left foot was firmly planted in a nest of fire ants! They built their mound under the leaves I was standing on, and they had every intention of defending it. Faced with a contingency I had never considered or prepared for, I did what any other aspiring thru-hiker would do...I panicked! My first instinct was to hop directly toward their position, so I did. Then, as the lead fire ants set up a perimeter on my underwear, another platoon began scaling my left hiking sock toward my bare shin. I took a deep breath and dropped a bomb on their home base, striking the edge of their nest. The impact knocked several off their feet, and completely ruined the day of several others.As the first ants summited my left sock, I raised up that foot and started shaking it, and swung my left hand down to swat at them. I then did a second hop, positioning myself directly over enemy lines, as hundreds of ants emerged from the nest. Just as the first ant stuck his mandibles into my left shin, I carpet bombed them, complete with sound effects. This was Day 3 at Gettysburg, and they were General Pickett. Their scouts were firmly entrenched all over my underwear and shorts now, but the villagers were in a full sprint to avoid the heavy bombardment. Once again, I raised and shook my left foot, and swung my hand down to swat at their antfantry maneuvering through my leg hair.My counter-offensive continued for a solid minute...hop, drop, shake, and swat. Collectively, this technique is called doing The Fob. Put it to music, and you have a dance that could be every bit as popular as the hokey pokey. Sometime when you're alone (or with that special someone) give it a try...hop (with half turn), drop (simulate by bending knees and wiggling rump), then raise and shake a foot, and then swat your ankle or knee. I find it works best while listening to You Dropped a Bomb on Me by The Gap Band...or the American Idol classic, Pants on the Ground.Out of ordnance, I hopped away from the carnage, swat killed the remaining ants from my drawers, and then cleaned up. Although they inflicted a dozen bites on my left leg, I rendered their entire community uninhabitable. I suspect the survivors will move to Reeds Gap and start over again.Fob","The Priest Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539700,"Day 81I was motivated right out of the gate today because my destination was Waynesboro, a popular trail town. Wayne's-boro! Wayne's-boro! Party on! Excellent! Near Humpback Mountain I passed a mother and daughter who were looking for and photographing butterflies. They were having the best time together and it made me miss my family. Jason and Kyle used to love going into the woods with me looking for butterflies. Not true.At mile 856.3 I stopped to get water at a stream near the Paul C. Wolfe Shelter. The water source, Mill Creek, has a waterfall and an area deep enough to soak. If I hadn't been so focused on getting to Waynesboro, I would have spent a couple of hours there.After a 17.3 mile day, I emerged from the woods at Rockfish Gap. Waynesboro, to their credit, has a sign posted where the trail exits the woods and you enter civilization. It contains the names and phone numbers of locals who have identified themselves as Trail Angels and are willing to give free shuttle rides into town for hikers. I greatly appreciated the handy list and wish all trail towns would do the same. I walked down a highway ramp and stopped at a roadside gourmet popcorn vendor's stand. Hungry, sweaty, and tired, I quickly consumed a hot dog, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade. I then called Tom ""Southerner"" Brown who said he'd be there in 10 minutes to shuttle me to town. How cool is that?!Southerner was there in under 10 minutes and gave me a quick driving tour of the town, pointing out restaurants, the grocery store, laundromat, etc. He's been giving rides to hikers for more than a decade and was very personable and helpful. He served in the Army Reserve, the IRS Criminal Division, and some other security related positions I'm not at liberty to share. I started to confess to him that on my 2013 federal tax return, I may have overvalued a Goodwill charitable donation. Specifically, the bag of old clothes probably wasn't worth the $30 I claimed. I decided to keep that to myself, so that Southerner wouldn't feel any pressure to make a phone call to his old office and make that problem go away.I decided to spend two nights in Waynesboro so that I could take a full zero day. I also decided to take advantage of a hostel run in the basement of Grace Lutheran. Good call! They open the doors at 5 p.m. and provide cots in their air conditioned Fellowship Hall, showers (best I've had on the AT so far), Internet, breakfast, and a hiker lounge. It's free, although they appreciate donations to cover their costs.After showering, I walked across town to do laundry and then had a terrific Western omelette dinner at Weasie's Kitchen. On the way back to the hostel, I re-supplied at a grocery store. Other hikers taking advantage of the hostel included Gamel, Legs, Verge, Hawaii, Tailspin, Chicken Feathers, Arrow, Apollo, and Two Ton. As I sat in the hiker lounge thinking the evening couldn't possibly get any better, a fellow hiker popped in a VHS of The Shawshank Redemption...one of my Top 5 all-time favorite movies. I sat there on the couch with Legs and Verge (sisters) and a few others, happy to be off the trail for awhile, and happy to be enjoying a great movie.Fob","Stealth Camp, mile 833

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539721,"Day 82I started my zero day with a wonderful breakfast courtesy of Grace Lutheran. I then showered and headed over to the YMCA. They didn't have a hot tub, but they did have scales, and I came in at 199.5...down 35.1 lbs since starting my journey. I haven't been under 200 lbs since college and it feels great.That sub-200 weight wouldn't last for long as I headed for lunch at Ming Garden's all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet. I had four full plates of food and two desserts. I dare any ants to attack me now! I then spent the rest of the afternoon at the library...digesting, resting and blogging. I also did some research and tracked down John and Linda, a sweet couple willing to give me a ride to Wednesday evening Bible Study at Waynesboro Church of Christ. It is always nice getting back on the trail after having been fed spiritually, physically, and emotionally. John and Linda not only drove me back to the hostel, but stopped at The Cook Out restaurant on the way so I could get some dinner to go (great burger and shake, but 4 small onion rings do no make a good side order of onion rings).That night, I called Southerner and he graciously agreed to pick me up in the morning and return me to the trailhead. I went to sleep that night thankful to have stopped in Waynesboro. I was also excited to take on the next leg of my journey...the magnificent Shenandoah National Park!Fob","Waynesboro

Quitting wrinkles the soul."" - General Douglas MacArthur""Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever."" - Lance ArmstrongDay 83After having breakfast at the hostel, I headed over to the Waynesboro library. I was able to call (FaceTime) with both Mr. Reeve's and Mrs. Wilkinson's classes at Foundation Christian Academy where I used to teach. I can always count on these youngsters to encourage me, ask good questions, and make me laugh. One of them asked if I have been scared of anything out here on the trail. The answer is no, although I have been stressed a few times trying to find a flat spot to camp with a thunderstorm bearing down on me. I hope in some small way I can inspire these amazing young people to dream big dreams and push the boundaries of their comfort zones. Perhaps some day one of them will grow up and decide to hike the AT.At 11 a.m. Southerner picked me up and returned me to the trailhead. As I was getting out of his truck, he said, ""Fob, I've been giving rides to hikers for more than a decade. You've hiked over 860 miles. People who make it this far rarely quit. A family emergency or injury could take you out. But just don't quit."" I appreciated his little pep talk and the two rides he gave me.Just don't quit. There is a lot of power, and potential, in those three words. I have only quit (resigned from) one thing in my life, and that was something I felt I needed to do. It was among the most difficult things I've ever done. Out here on the trail, there is always...always...a voice in your head giving you a good reason to quit (tired, homesick, lack of funds, rocks, bugs, bitter cold, gear failure, heat and humidity, etc.). There is also another voice giving you one or more reasons to stay. My reasons to stay are on my very first AT blog which I refer to regularly. My strategy, which has worked so far, is to have an overwhelming number of reasons to stay, which counteract and muffle the voices suggesting otherwise. In other words, leaving has to be more painful than staying. So, barring an injury or family emergency, I'm staying. I'm not quitting. Ever. Just typing those words and publicly making that pledge has given me yet another reason not to quit. The voice telling me to stay just got louder.One mile into today's hike, I filled out a registration form and entered the 103.2-mile long Shenandoah National Park (SNP). If you want to get an idea what hiking the AT is like, don't base it on hiking the SNP. Hiking the AT in SNP is like spending a week at Disney World. For starters, the terrain is fairly easy, with only a few moderate hills. At times, it feels like you're walking through an airport on a moving walkway. On top of that, you have several eateries throughout the park...just bring some cash as they aren't cheap. I brought three days worth of food and only ate two days worth. You also have various campgrounds and resorts available along the way. If that weren't enough, the park is full of bears, deer, and other wildlife. After 862.3 challenging, sometimes grueling, miles on the AT, I was ready for a week of pampering...or so I thought.Given my late start, I only hiked 11.2 miles today. I passed a couple of Southbounders getting water, along with a day-hiking couple from the Netherlands. At mile 870, I passed a somewhat interesting milestone as that is how far Bill Bryson hiked (across various sections) before stopping to write his book, A Walk in the Woods.That's also when I heard the first rumblings of a massive thunderstorm headed my way. I had about 30 minutes before it (and sunset) would arrive, so I picked up my pace and began looking for a spot to camp. The first two spots I came to were perfect, except that hikers were already there and set up. I hiked on.With about 15 minutes to go until the ""yellow/red band"" (severe thunderstorm) hit the blue dot (me) on my weather app, and with the thunder getting louder, I climbed toward Turk Gap as fast as I can hike uphill without actually running. At mile 872.5, the wind picked up, lighting struck nearby, and I felt the first drop of rain. I was tense, out of breath, and in an increasingly dangerous situation. So I stopped. I took a deep breath, gathered myself, and went through my options. The only good option was to go into the woods and carve out a place to camp...quickly. I dropped my pack and set up my tent in record time. I grabbed a few granola bars out of my food bag and then hung it in a nearby tree...also in record time. (Surviving a thunderstorm does you no good if you're eaten by a bear.). As the leading edge of the thunderstorm hit and the heavy rain began to fall, I jumped into my tent and zipped it up. A minute later, lighting struck nearby. I can't say how close, but it was loud and there was a flash-bang.While I was still in some danger from a lightning strike or tree falling on me (see http://appalachiantrail.com/20150316/appalachian-trail-hiker-jason-parish-suffers-fatal-injury/ ), I felt safe and secure inside my tent. I stripped off all my clothes, blew up my air mattress, and stretched out across it.As heavy rain, thunder, and lightning continued, I ate three granola bars for dinner. I thanked God for, once again, providing relative safety, warmth and comfort inside my tent. I thought about my first ten miles in Shenandoah National Park, the supposed Disney World of AT hiking, and wondered whether I should have vacationed on a cruise ship instead. I thought about my wife, sons, and daughters-in-law. I wondered whether lightning hitting my food bag would cause my pop tarts to be warm in the morning. I thought about a lot of things that night, but not about quitting. Why? Well, as my friend Southerner might say, you ""just don't quit.""Fob","Waynesboro

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540004,"""The man who has accomplished all that he thinks worthwhile has begun to die.""    - E. T. TriggDay 84After a night of thunderstorms, I awoke to an overcast, humid morning. The trail crosses Skyline Drive several times and that's often where the best views are. At mile 882 I stopped for water at Blackrock Hut. As I filtered water at the spring near the hut, I looked up and saw AT snake #10 about 15 feet away on a pile of rocks. As I stood up and got my phone out, he slithered between two rocks and out of sight.Back at the hut, I met a hiker and his injured dog. The dog's paws were torn up from the trail and the hiker was cutting way back on miles to give them time to heal. Although I understand a hiker's need for companionship, I'm personally not a big fan of taking dogs on long distance hikes. Logistically, they make everything more difficult...provisions, rock scrambles, stores, hotels, etc. It can also take a major toll on them physically. The same is true for hikers, but the dog doesn't get a vote. So I wouldn't recommend bringing a dog along, even though I enjoy petting them and receiving an occasional lick on the mouth.A half-mile later, I climbed Blackrock, a massive pile of boulders and perhaps the most interesting geological feature in all of Shenandoah National Park (SNP). I'm told the boulders are there, rather than trees, because they are still shifting/moving. Later that day, at mile 891.5, I took a .5 mile side trail to my first SNP eatery, the Loft Mountain Wayside! I downed a cheeseburger, fries, and milkshake in under five minutes, got water, and charged my phone. I kept waiting for Mickey Mouse to appear and give me a big Disney hug but that never happened.Partially full and happy, I hiked on and crossed Ivy Creek. That's when I entered the area that had been burned by the April forest fire. The fire, second largest in SNP history, burned over 16 square miles, causing the evacuation of hikers and the temporary closing of Skyline Drive. I decided to stealth camp in this area, at mile 893, finishing up a 20.5 mile day. As I set up camp, Tree and Big Pea passed by and we spoke briefly. After crawling into my tent, I had a good SNP milkshake belch, breathed in the light smell of burnt forest, and dozed off to sleep.Fob","Stealth Camp, SNP, mile 872.5

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540125,"""There are no strangers here; Only friends you haven't yet met.""    - William Butler YeatsDay 85Choosing the most difficult section of the AT in SNP is like choosing the ugliest Dallas Cowboys cheerleader. But for me, I would go with the section between miles 892.1 and 911.9. There were a few moderate climbs, enough to cause me to break out into a full sweat. I saw a few deer and a few hikers going in each direction. Most hikers reported having seen one or more bears in the park, but so far I'd only seen large mounds of bear poop.As I hit the 19-mile mark on the day, I was tired and more rain was in the forecast. I looked at my guide and saw that the Lewis Mountain Campground and Cabins, featuring a camp store with laundry and showers, was only 3 miles away. Decision time. Option 1 - stop now and camp, stay dry, rest tired feet and body. Option 2 - press on, risk getting wet, further tire the body, but reach the campground. My feet voted for Option 1, but they were overruled by the rest of my body. I pressed on and hiked to the campground, just as rain started to fall. It had been a 22-mile day, my longest on the AT so far, and my 6th 20+ day overall.At the Lewis Mountain Campground store, I met the manager, Randy, who has been working there more than 30 years. He's a friendly, outgoing person who loves telling stories and jokes to hikers. My first priority was to take my first-ever coin-operated hot shower. As the rain continued to fall, I put in a load of laundry and purchased a Stromboli and chocolate ice cream. As I sat there on the porch eating, Tree Beard approached me and said, ""Hey, Fob, a bunch of us went in on the hiker cabin if you want to join us. It's rustic, and all the beds are taken, but you can sleep on the floor or on the covered porch under a picnic table. It would save you from having to tent in the rain."" I replied, ""Yes! Absolutely! Thank you so much! I'll be over in 10 minutes.""It's funny how perspectives change on the AT. In the real world, it's so easy to complain if the hotel room temperature is a little cool or warm or the church pew isn't soft enough. Here I am, on the AT, absolutely thrilled to be offered a 6' by 3' section of dirty floor in a small, rustic cabin with 5 other tired, smelly hikers. That, my friends, is how the AT can change your perspective and make you appreciate what you have rather than complain about what you don't have. Mission trips, by the way, have a similar effect.Several of us sat around the small cabin porch that night telling stories and enjoying each other's company. I met Happy, an older military veteran doing a section hike. We were joined by Tree Beard, Waterfall, Pantry, Too Tall, Tree, and Arrow. Arrow, a short, friendly hiker in her early 20s, is considering a military career, and asked for my advice on the differences between the services, types of jobs within the military, pros and cons of military life, etc. Having grown up as a military kid and then having served a 23-year Air Force career myself, I had some opinions on these subjects. Among other things, I told her the most successful people I knew in the military had two things in common:1. People skills...the ability to understand, relate to, and get along with people. No one likes to work for or with self-centered jerks. On the contrary, people who respect you and enjoy working with/for you are generally going to be highly motivated...which makes it easier to accomplish the mission.2. Communication skills...the ability to sell your ideas through speaking, writing, or giving a presentation. If you have good ideas on how to fix things, how to ""work your boss's problems"", and you can effectively pitch your solutions, you are going to stand out.As an Air Force personnel officer, I have given career and other forms of counseling to hundreds, maybe thousands of Airmen through the years. It felt good to wear that hat again and try to help out a young lady who is trying to plan out her life while on the AT.As we sat there, I checked tomorrow's forecast. It was supposed to rain most of the day. Tree Beard, who is quickly turning into one of my favorite hikers said, ""You know, we could take a zero tomorrow and avoid the rain. One of the nicer, regular cabins is available. If we split the cost it'd be cheap. And I talked to Randy, the manager. I think I might be able to convince him to loan me his truck so we can go into town for some grub and re-supply."" He had me at ""zero day and avoid the rain"". Yes, we can hike in the rain, and sometimes we need to. But sometimes you audible to a day just hanging out with friends, staying dry, not hiking, and resting the body. Everyone wholeheartedly agreed with Tree Beard's proposal, as did my feet.Fob","Stealth Camp, SNP, mile 893

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540281,"Day 86I slept well last night on the floor next to Tree and an old wood stove. When I awoke, Tree Beard was on the porch in deep thought, plotting a strategy. I have been amazed out here with the boldness with which hikers ask for things. I know a hiker who saw an older woman working on some landscaping and other yard work on the main drag in Hot Springs. He approached her and offered to do whatever yard work needed done in exchange for a bed or couch to sleep on. She counter-offered that in exchange for his work, she would pay the $20 fee for his hostel stay that night. Deal! That's how you do the AT on a budget.I don't know what he said or how he did it, but somehow Tree Beard convinced Randy to loan us his truck not once, but twice, today! I wouldn't loan a vehicle to a just passing through thru-hiker in a million years. We smell and we haven't driven a vehicle in awhile. Still, I appreciated Randy's kindness and the trust he put in us. Perhaps after thirty years of doing this, he has a good sense of who he can trust. I repaid the favor by filling up his truck with gas.We all piled in the truck and headed to the Big Meadows Wayside for a delicious hiker's breakfast. At the gift shop, I got several SNP postcards for family. Tree Beard dropped $40 on a red bear onesie with a trap door opening in the back. It reminded me of something Jason, my eldest, would have worn to play club softball in at Harding University.We returned to the campground and checked into our new, upgraded cabin. This one had two bedrooms with queen beds, and a bathroom in the middle. It's designed for four people. Our plan was to double that number, plus a dog, by bringing in two cots and using the remaining floor space. Tree Beard offered the 8th and final spot to Fire Starter, a rare late 30s/early 40s female hiker. We spent the afternoon resting, reading, napping, blogging, calling family, and snacking.That evening, we all piled back into Randy's truck as rain started to fall. Tree, bless his heart, volunteered to sit in the bed of the truck and endure the rain for our 20-minute drive to Elkton. I was scrunched in the back kiddie jumper seat with two other hikers, including Fire Starter. With our knees semi-painfully jammed next to each other's, I asked her where she was from (near Nashville) and what college she went to (Harding University). Imagine that! She graduated in 2006 and won some awards as editor of the school newspaper, The Bison. I'm in the backseat of a truck in the rain with a fellow hiker, and she graduated from the same university as my two sons. I thought...it's a small world. In fact, here on the AT in SNP, you could say it's a small world after all.After a delicious meal at Ciro's Italian restaurant in Elkton, we stopped at a grocery store and then returned to the cabin. Since I slept on the floor the previous night, I qualified for a highly coveted spot on the queen bed. Tree Beard earned the other spot by virtue of having suggested the zero day and for acquiring the use of the truck. Pantry and his dog were on the floor, Arrow was on the cot, and the four other hikers were in the adjoining cabin.As I laid there on the bed, Tree Beard emerged from the bathroom wearing his red bear onesie with a trap door. Of the roughly 4000 people who will attempt an AT thru-hike this year, I somehow managed to be in bed with a guy named Tree Beard wearing a red onesie. I can't make this stuff up. As he crawled into bed and we turned the lights off, I told him I appreciated all he had done for us today. I also reminded him that I'm happily married and he had better keep his trap door shut!Fob","Hiker Cabin, Lewis Mountain Campground

As I descended Hazeltop near mile 919.5, I saw the first of more than a dozen deer I would see in Shenandoah National Park (SNP).As I approached the Big Meadows area, I saw another deer sitting in the grass off to the right. I decided to stop for a snack, so I sat down by a tree about fifteen yards from her. She looked at me but didn't move. I chugged some water and then pulled out a Clif energy bar. As I did so, the deer stood up and stared at me. She had that ""Fob, I want a bite of your Clif energy bar"" look in her sultry eyes. Then she cautiously took a step toward me. With my heart racing just a tad, I pulled out my phone and started recording her. Next, I violated the principle of ""keeping wildlife wild"" by holding out my Clif bar. Intrigued, she took another step toward me and then another. At this point I should have stood up and left. After all, she should eat natural food. She should fear humans. She could get spooked and injure me or maybe get a disease. My head told me this maybe wasn't a good idea. My heart told me it was a once in a lifetime opportunity and I should go for it.My heart won out. I wiggled the Clif bar and she kept moving closer. Just a couple of feet from me, she stuck out her neck and licked the bar. I didn't have a good grip on it and it fell, causing her to jump back a step. Continuing to film, I picked it up and held it out again. She approached and gave it a few more licks. She was so close I could almost smell her breath. She then decided it wasn't for her. Or maybe she smelled my breath. Clif bars are nutritious and delicious, but they require a lot of chewing to get down. Perhaps she wasn't up for that. She eventually slowly walked away. It was a really cool wilderness moment that I will never forget. It wasn't necessarily the right/textbook thing to do, but it was certainly the fun, cool, and memorable thing to do. I won't do it again because I've done it once. But would I do it again a first time? Absolutely! How often can you live a happy, magical moment that you will remember the rest of your life?Fresh off this wildlife encounter, I took a short side trail to the Big Meadows Lodge where I had a Caesar's salad and seven glasses of pink lemonade. Why? Because I could. This is SNP, the second happiest place on earth...just behind Disney World. I hiked on, passing two more deer and a small snake (#11) near Fishers Gap.After 16.7 miles I arrived at the Skyland Resort and Restaurant around 4:30 p.m. This is a fairly upscale place so I assumed a room would be out of my price range. But since I was close, it was worth a shot. The normal price was well out of my range. The ""thru-hiker rate"" was substantially less, but still more than I wanted to pay. Then I thought to ask if they had a military rate. Bam! Bada-Bing! It was even less than the hiker rate and within my fair and reasonable range. So I got a 1-room cabin and took a nice hot shower.I put on my less funky set of clothes and headed to the Skyland Restaurant for the fried chicken basket (1807 calories, according to the menu) which included half a fried chicken, garlic mashed potatoes, cranberry relish, and steamed cauliflower. The waitress brought me the dessert menu and I selected three large scoops of ice cream...vanilla bean, chocolate, and signature blackberry...coming in at 1026 calories. As I swallowed the last bite of ice cream, a guitarist took the stage and sang and played for the next couple of hours. He asked the audience where we were from. I didn't answer because I don't know. It's complicated. I'm just an American. He then asked the thirty audience members...day hikers, vacationers and me...who had seen a bear this week. Every single hand went up but mine. This hardly seemed fair.As I laid there that night in my soft cabin bed, I reflected on my near perfect day. Where in the world do you have a close encounter with a deer, a Caesar salad with lemonade, a fried chicken dinner, three scoops of ice cream, live music, a hot shower, and a soft pillow and bed to sleep on? At Shenandoah National Park, I say, the second happiest place on earth.Fob","Cabin, Lewis Mountain Campground

Before leaving the Skyland Lodge area, I couldn't help but think about the 1996 murders of two female hikers just 1/2 mile from the lodge. I did a fair amount of research on AT murders and other crimes before starting my journey. While one is safer on the AT than in a city or on a highway, bad stuff can and does still happen. If you want to read more about the murder of these two ladies, check out this link... http://www.readthehook.com/85806/cover-murder-park-rice-release-revives-memoriesAt mile 942.6 I approached the Pass Mountain Hut to get water and use the privy. A fellow hiker standing by the hut looked at me and said, ""Hey, you're Fob! Do you know Larry Alexander?"" I answered, ""Maybe. What did he do?"" (One must always be careful in associating oneself with Larry in case any sort of crime has been committed.) The hiker replied, ""We have something in common. Larry gave both of us our trail names. I'm now called Little Brother but on the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail) I hiked with Larry (trail name Baro) for awhile and he named me Young Gun. And I know through your blog post on Larry's Facebook page that he named you Fob W. Pot."" I said, ""Wow! It's a small world (after all). Larry is a great dude.

He got up and ran but the bear got away! He was lost with no tent and no food but there was a creek full of clean water. He saw his yellow tent but it was about 7 miles away. He got to his tent but it suddenly burned. I don't know why or even how. He found his food and picked it up and it burned. 'Wow, I can't even make a fire but I burn everything I touch,' he said.

A real life Shenandoah National Park black bear! Yes! Finally! I had joined the club of aspiring thru-hikers who've seen a bear in the wild! No longer would I be made fun of a shelters, campsites and lodge restaurants. Instinctively, I crouched to one knee and, for just the second time on my AT journey, raised both trekking poles in the air in the single troop phalanx formation. I bowed my head and whispered, ""Spartan, prepare for glory."" I'd seen The Revenant and now I was Hugh Glass, about to be charged and mauled by a bear in the wild. The bear, still a good 25 yards away, continued to calmly forage for berries and grubs along the trail. She (or maybe he, I didn't check for parts) just completely ignored me. Like the attitude of the girls at most middle school dances I ever attended, I didn't exist. There was not even a warning growl or threatening glance. I eventually stood up and returned my trekking poles to a non-defensive position.I guess this was not my day to die. But a problem remained...the bear was directly in my path, right on the AT, and was taking her sweet time foraging and enjoying the day. So I got a little closer for the obligatory photo and video, and then sat down on a rock to wait her out. I ate a granola bar, drank some water, wiped the sweat off my arms and face, and waited. And waited. I started to throw a warning rock or yell, ""Excuse me, Winnie the Pooh, hate to bother you...but I'm hiking the AT...trying to survive out here in the wild by living off the land...and I need to get to the next SNP eatery for a blackberry milkshake before they close. Any chance you could move it along and forage elsewhere?"" Eventually, on her own schedule, without regard to my feelings or agenda, she moved her black hairy behind along. I continued northward, but I was a different Fob now, a battle-hardened Fob who had survived a close encounter with a distant, non-threatening, berry-eating wild bear.Delayed by my near bear attack, I kicked it into high gear in order to make it to Elkwallow Wayside before they closed. I arrived just in time and ordered a pretzel, grilled cheese, and blackberry milkshake. Why? Because I could. This was Shenandoah National Park, the second happiest place on planet earth. And this is how we roll here...no apologies. I was joined at the Wayside picnic table by a trio of aspiring thru-hikers...Happy Feet (from Germany), Pharmacist (from Laurens, SC), and a guy from Idaho. I enjoyed talking to them, even after they told me they were hiking on Skyline Drive some of the time because it was ""more scenic"" than the actual AT. They are right about that, but as a white blaze loving purist, this was like hearing someone's nails scraped across a chalkboard. But hey, hike your own hike.It was starting to get dark, so I ended my 19.2 mile day stealth camping at mile 950.9, near Rattlesnake Point Overlook.

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540828,"Day 89About mid-morning I stopped at the Gravel Springs Hut to get water and use the privy. Just after exiting the privy, I heard a loud cracking sound and spun around just in time to see a large tree branch fall on the privy! Had the branch fallen 3 minutes earlier, I would have been trapped inside the privy. Within seconds, my skin would have started to peel off. Within minutes, the putrid privy smell would have caused asphyxia-induced hypoxia. They eventually would have found Fob in a fetal position, moldering away at the bottom of the tank.After removing the branch, I hiked on. Near Little Hogback Mountain and South Marshall Mountain, I saw my second and third (final) SNP bear. I was a little more confident following yesterday's encounter, so I attempted to pose for a selfie with the second bear. However, by the time I got my phone positioned and the angle just right, the bear had scampered off. Thus, I ended up taking the worst bear selfie in history, as there is no bear in it! By the way, some of the selfies I post on my blog appear upside down on some computers. Sorry about that. It looks right side up on my phone. Anyway, the photos in my eventual book will all be right side up.""So one day Fob wanted to hike the Aplachin Trail so he did but when he got there he felt a tickle in his backpack so he turned around and saw a bear taking a samwhich so he chased him for awhile and gave up so he saw a deer and tried to get a selfie but the deer hid in the pond and Fob was not happy but he went to get his phone and it fell in and he said why did i do this.""    - Aldon L, 5th GraderAt mile 965.5 I exited and said farewell to Shenandoah National Park. It had lived up to its lofty reputation and my memories of the friendly deer, ferocious bears, and delicious blackberry milkshakes will remain with me forever.Not quite ready to give up my week of comfortable backpacking, I decided, after an 18.2 mile day, to stay at the Mountain Home Cabbin (yes, with two b's) near Front Royal. The owners, Scott and Lisa, were extremely helpful and friendly. After he thru-hiked the AT, they bought the abandoned, dilapidated historic property and are renovating and restoring the various structures a piece at a time. The property was once owned by Samuel Gardner, a magistrate and horse and cattle farmer. He owned 3000+ acres and used the hostel where I stayed, which dates to 1847, as slave quarters and later as the tri-county courthouse. Scott and Lisa are still renovating the main house which will one day become an upscale bed and breakfast. He ran me into town to grab a bite and resupply, and she gave me a great tour of the property and historic buildings.We had quite a mix of folks staying at the hostel that night. Four of us were upstairs, including another hiker with a leg injury who will seek treatment in Front Royal. Next to him (in nearby beds) were Matt and Sarah, who are finishing up a 3-week long archaeological dig at the nearby Belle Grove Plantation. They are trying to locate the plantation's slave quarters in support of Matt's doctoral work at Syracuse University. Scott and Lisa were downstairs, since their living quarters in the main house are still being renovated. They were joined by a Fulbright scholar who was on her way to a conference in Washington D.C. She will eventually teach English in Indonesia. Each of these hostel guests are on missions, and had compelling stories, and getting to know them certainly enriched my own AT story.Fob","Stealth Camp near Rattlesnake Point Overlook

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540957,"""The only normal people are the ones you don't know very well."" - Joe AncisDay 90I left the hostel and headed north. There was a massive fenced in area nearby, which I learned is the Smithsonian Conservation Biological Institute. The 3200-acre campus houses a variety of endangered species, including the cloud leopard, mane wolf, American Bison, and cheetah. As a conservative Christian, I probably should have been on that side of the fence as well. Prior to its use for conservation, the area was used to train war horses during World War I.My priority today was to coordinate a time and place to meet my friends, Darrell and Alicia Brimberry. My wife and I met, went to church with, and became friends with the Brimberry's during my military assignment at the Pentagon. We share a love of the outdoors, and they plan to thru-hike the AT themselves in 2017 after he retires from the Army. Their plan was to set up a trail magic station for me and other hikers and then Darrell would hike with me for a couple of days. Alicia would then pick us up in Harpers Ferry and take us to their home on Bolling AFB in DC for some rest, recuperation and resupply. Needless to say, I was really excited about all of this.Plan A had them setting up at Manassas Gap, but the timing worked better to shift that northward. I suggested Plan B which involved them setting up at Ashby Gap, mile 989.1. It seemed to make sense as the map showed the AT crossing a road there. My job was to hike at least as far as Dicks Dome Shelter, so I would be within 5 miles of their position the following morning.Here, then, is how the best laid plan can unravel. When I got to Dicks Dome Shelter, I called an audible. Rather than face a mile ascent and five mile hike in the morning, I decided to go an extra mile. This would shorten my journey tomorrow and my AT guide showed a spring up on Signal Knob. Being nearly out of water, finding some was paramount. So I climbed the mile up Signal Knob only to discover the spring was completely dry. Not good. Not good at all. Given my increasingly desperate need for water, I had to hike on. A mile later I entered Sky Meadows State Park. It's a beautiful park, but unfortunately camping is not allowed there along the AT. There are also no water sources there along the AT. Thirsty and tired and with no place to camp, I hiked on. A few miles later I arrived at Ashby Gap, our Plan B meeting point. The good news...there was a little creek so I could get much needed water. The bad news...this was a terrible spot for the Brimberrys to do trail magic. It was among the most dangerous, divided highway road crossings on the AT. So with the sun starting to set, I called Darrell and told him we needed a Plan C, but my priority at the moment was to find a place to set up my tent before it got dark.Exhausted, I continued northward and eventually found a nice spot by a stream at mile 991.1, just as it got dark. After settling in, I called Darrell and he proposed a new Trail Magic and rendezvous point at Snickers Gap, about 12 miles north. I agreed, mainly because I heard him say Snickers. After my 21.7 mile day, I just wanted to go to sleep...and so I did.My takeaways from the above narrative:1) It's not easy coordinating a time and place to meet someone on the AT because there are so many variables involved. I'm glad the Brimberrys were patient with me and flexible.2) You can't always rely on water being available where your AT Guide indicates, unless it's a major source like a river. Thus, it's good to have a backup plan, preferably one that doesn't require hiking at night or in bad weather.3) The butterfly effect is alive and well on the AT. One seemingly small decision (like hiking just one more mile) can have a much larger ripple effect, like having to actually hike 7 more miles (bad effect) and discovering the planned rendezvous point needs to be changed (good effect). I find it interesting to think about how my life might have been different had I made different decisions and flipped different levers.4) Romans 8:28 says ""And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."" I think this verse tells me, among other things, that if I love God and try my best to live faithfully, he is going to ultimately bring about good outcomes in my life...regardless of which specific lever I flip (college choice, career choice, choice of spouse, etc.). I can (and do) make bad choices on the AT that have bad consequences, but I feel like God just figures out a way to have some good come out of them.Fob","Mountain Home Cabbin

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541103,"""Excellence in any pursuit is the late, ripe fruit of toil."" - W. M. L. JayDay 91After getting water near the Rod Hollow Shelter, I strapped on my proverbial seatbelt and began the famous AT Roller Coaster! The Roller Coaster is a 13.5 mile stretch of non-stop ups and downs. There is a total gain of more than 5000 feet as you make your way over more than a dozen steep, rocky hills. It's a parting shot from Virginia before entering West Virginia.A little more than halfway up and down the Roller Coaster, I came across a simple sign marking the 1000 mile point for northbound AT hikers. I had to stop for a minute and let that sink in. I just hike 1000 miles! I took a picture, of course. I also said a prayer of thanksgiving. I didn't ask God for anything in this prayer, I just thanked him for bringing me this far on the journey without serious injury or incident. I posted the photo on my Facebook page, and received a comment from Rex Dutton, our preacher from Florida, which I found quite profound. Rex wrote:""Congratulations! These adventures are going to make an awesome book one day soon. God will work through this journey of yours to do many great things! I have so enjoyed your posts! And for the rest of us who will never accomplish anything so significant, and may feel useless from time to time, I could not help but think about that tree behind you bearing that sign... It has never been anywhere, and yet, there it stands and it still serves an important purpose.""By ""anything so significant"" I think Rex is referring to noteworthy, out of the ordinary physical feats. I reminded him that preaching 40+ years, as he has done, is an amazing, world-changing accomplishment that far exceeds hiking a trail...even a really long trail. I really appreciate his final point about the tree holding the sign. No glory. No fanfare. It's not the biggest or oldest or prettiest tree on the AT or even that mountain. But it has a job to do and does it well. By doing its job, it allows the sign, and the thousands of hikers who stand in front of it, to get the glory.I suspect among my readers there may be a few folks who feel useless or unappreciated at times. Maybe your life seems boring. You may think, ""All I do is (fill in the blank)."" Maybe it's been awhile since your boss, customers, children, or spouse have thanked you for what you do. Let me remind you your life has significance because God made you...in His image! Your life has significance because Christ made the ultimate sacrifice, giving his own life, to make your salvation possible. God has a plan and purpose for each one of us. Ecclesiastes 9:10 says, ""Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might..."" Whether you are a plumber or teacher, a janitor or doctor, a tree or a sign, be a good one...do it well. Whether you aspire to hike the AT or just aspire to get through the day, know that what you do matters and makes a difference. You are a hero to someone, so keep on keeping on.By mid-afternoon, at mile 1003.2, I arrived at Snickers Gap. I crossed the road and made my way over to Darrell and Alicia's Trail Magic station. She came running up to hug me, which means she'll probably need to throw her outfit away. I was that funky from my Roller Coaster ride. The two of them had been there for a few hours, giving out drinks, fruit, cookies and other goodies to hikers. There was quite a crowd there when I arrived. Alicia had prepared a private cooler of drinks and goodies just for me which was way, way cool!After resting, eating, drinking, and visiting a bit, we said farewell to Alicia, and Darrell and I headed northward. For the first time in my journey, I was hiking with a long-time friend. He was eager and fresh, in part because he had missed most of the Roller Coaster and hadn't hiked 12 miles in the heat that morning. I really enjoyed hiking with him and getting caught up on children, career, future plans, etc. Not surprisingly, he had several AT-related questions for me as he continues to prepare for their 2017 thru-hike attempt. At mile 1005.7, we stopped for a photo at the sign telling us we were crossing over into West Virginia, state #5!At mile 1010.6, after a 19.5 mile day for me, we stopped for the night at the Blackburn AT Center. It wasn't quite a challenging first night with me on the trail for Darrell, as we slept on the large screened-in porch of the Center and were offered big bowls of soup by the caretaker.It had been an interesting couple of days, featuring a 1000-mile marker, Trail Magic, a Roller Coaster, a border crossing, and multiple changes of plans. Ultimately, God worked everything out for me, as I knew he would. I'm especially thankful he saw fit to provide me with a good friend to hike with, if only for a couple of days.Fob","Stealth Camp, Mile 991.1

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541323,"""Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.""    - Leo BuscagliaDay 92""Hey, Fob, the coffee's ready when you are,"" Darrell whispered in my face.I slowly opened my eyes and tried to focus them. Darrell's eyes seemed disproportionately large for his face and his voice was disproportionately eager for someone over the age of seven. Before responding, I looked at my watch. It was 4:37 a.m. That's early, even for AT hikers. Really early. It was so early that it was almost yesterday. There are clearly differences between an active duty Army colonel his first morning on the AT and a retired Air Force colonel on his 92nd AT morning. I didn't know whether to thank Darrell for the coffee, or stab him in the temples with my carbide-tipped trekking poles. Not wanting to squash his enthusiasm for the AT, I half-heartedly thanked him for waking me in order to enjoy fresh coffee. I was sure it would taste good after I slept four more hours.Shortly after 7 a.m., Morning Coffee (Darrell's temporary trail name) and I left the Blackburn AT Center, along with a hiker named Hammer. Just as we got on the trail, I asked Morning Coffee if he would lead the three of us in a prayer and he obliged. (Just before getting on the AT, I received a call from Darrell and he said a prayer over the phone with me. After 1000 miles, it made sense for him to say another one.)The morning hike was mostly flat but it was hot and humid. I didn't have a lot of energy which may have been a result of hiking a combined 80 miles, including the Roller Coaster, the previous four days. We enjoyed hiking with and talking to Hammer about his past business successes and difficulties, along with politics, religion and other topics.By mid-afternoon, we crossed over into West Virginia (again) and made the descent, climb, and descent into Harpers Ferry. It had only been a 12.5 mile day, but I was exhausted, completely soaked, and my butt was chafing. At the famous Jefferson Rock, where Thomas Jefferson once said something profound while scratching his own chafing butt, we stopped for a picture. We then headed down the hill into downtown Harpers Ferry where a smiling Alicia was waiting for us.Our next stop was Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters which, unfortunately, was .6 miles uphill. That may not seem far for a long distance hiker, but I was completely spent and had two loggers in my underwear sawing my butt crack with sandpaper.After trudging along behind Morning Coffee and Alicia about 50 yards, a woman got out of a car parked on the side of the road. She said, ""Hey, Fob, it's Kailah! Wanna ride?"" ""Is there room for the two loggers in my butt crack?"" I started to say, but though better of it. Kailah, in addition to being an angel sent from heaven that day, is the niece of Chuck and Jana Leasure, some friends from our Virginia days. I met her years ago at a wedding and she has been keeping up with my AT journey through my blog. She knew about when I would be arriving in Harpers Ferry and figured I might want a ride up that hill. She figured right! She handed me an ice cold Gatorade (pure magic), a bag of snacks, and some unnecessary but appreciated lunch money. I thanked her from the bottom of my heart on the way up the hill and invited her to lunch with us. Unfortunately, she was on her way to a wedding and had to decline. But she wished me well on my journey and told me to finish strong. If I finish at all, it will be because of people like her and the Brimberrys and others who came along at just the right time to meet a need.Despite my exhaustion and being drenched in sweat, it was pretty cool walking into ATC HQ with the Brimberrys and the loggers in my underwear. Although I'm more into actual halfway points than psychological ones like Harpers Ferry, it felt really special being there. I had been there a decade earlier with Janet, and I told her I would be back some day as an aspiring thru-hiker. Today was that day. I had my photo taken and signed the hiker book with my information. I was northbound hiker #607. Ninety-one days to Harpers Ferry isn't bad for a 50-year-old who has taken two weeks off (for a wedding and spousal rendezvous) and is attempting to write a book along the way.The Brimberrys and I invited Hammer and another hiker named Pocahontas to have dinner with us at a nearby Italian restaurant. Upon arrival, I headed to the restroom to rinse the loggers and sandpaper from my nether regions and to apply a copious amount of Gold Bond. It stung in a good way, like watching your final child graduate and leave the nest. I then changed into the clean set of Morning Coffee's clothes that Alicia brought me. They will need to be incinerated.We headed back to the Brimberry's lovely home on Bolling AFB where the magic continued. I took a hot shower and then a cold one and then a hot bath. Not just any hot bath but a bubble bath, featuring their daughter, Holly's bubbles from Frozen (the movie). I laid back and closed my eyes, just extremely blessed to be in that place at that moment. After dozing off for a few minutes, I opened my eyes and Frozen's Elsa was staring at me from the bubble container at the other end of the tub. Like Morning Coffee recently, her eyes seemed disproportionately large for the rest of her head. I didn't appreciate her bug eyes staring at my fobness, so I reached up and turned the bottle around. Little Frozen creep.After my long hot bubble bath, I stepped on the scales and weighed 192.5 pounds. That puts me at my college weight, 44 pounds lost so far on my journey. I suspected Janet was going to tell me to eat more, and she did. The gorging would begin moments later as I sat down to a magnificent steak dinner, courtesy of Team Brimberry! Her instructions from Janet involved feeding me a lot, and I would end up gaining six pounds during my 32 hours with the Brimberrys.As I laid in a soft, comfortable bed that night, I read the Fathers Day cards sent to me by my family. It was a great ending to a great day with two very special people.Fob","Blackburn AT Center Porch

Everyone you meet is your mirror.""    - Ken Keyes Jr.Day 93Today would be a very special zero day because I was headed to worship at the Manassas Church of Christ where Janet and I were members from 2004-2008. It was great to see some familiar faces, especially brothers and sisters in Christ. After services, I went to lunch with the Brimberrys, Leasures, and Paul and Trish Johnson. It was good to be with long time friends and eat a filling pasta meal. I also appreciated the two bags of cookies that Jana Leasure gave me. After lunch, I went to a movie with the Brimberrys (where I ate a large popcorn) and then to Dunkin Donuts for a coffee and donut. After evening worship, we headed back to Bolling AFB for my final night of pampering.I got my laundry together and made a few gear and clothing adjustments. Since I haven't used my stove in a couple of weeks, I left it behind. While I enjoyed cooking at night when it was cold out (or even cool), I don't feel the need in hot, humid weather. I'm perfectly content to have tortillas with salami and cheese, or peanut butter and honey, or peanut butter and coconut oil. It means a quicker dinner and no clean up. Not carrying a stove and fuel also saves some weight and space, and I don't mind waiting until the occasional trail town for hot food. I also left behind my gloves, thick socks, and puffy winter jacket, which will eventually be sent to me with the stove when it starts to get cooler again up north.Alicia and Morning Coffee had a final surprise for me. They set up a vibrating, heated, bubbly foot bath in the living room, which made me consider quitting the trail and moving in with them. As I sat there relaxing and soaking, I downed two large bowls of Corn Pops. Just before going to bed, Morning Coffee informed me we could sleep in and didn't need to leave until 8 a.m. He seemed less eager than before, and his eyes were in proportion to the rest of his head. Maybe I'll start calling him Darrell again.Fob","Bolling AFB, DC

I thanked them again for their generous hospitality and then headed northward. I entered Maryland, my 6th state, by crossing the Potomac River on the Byron Memorial Footbridge. Next up was the C&O Canal Towpath, a perfectly flat, 3.2 mile stretch that runs between the railroad and the Potomac River. During this stretch, I added one deer and fifty or so turtles to my wildlife total.At mile 1029.4 I hiked past the Ed Garvey Shelter where, just last year, a dead tree fell on a 36-year-old hiker named Jason Parish, killing him. Jason was just about to leave the shelter at the end of a 3-day camping trip with two friends when strong winds brought the tree down on him. Like me, he was born in Dover, Delaware and had a love for the AT. It was another reminder that you just never know when your time is up, so make the most of the time God has given you.While the AT in Maryland has a reputation for being a tad boring, I actually found it pretty interesting. It has some terrific parks, campgrounds, and Civil War history. Today's highlight was a visit to beautiful Gathland State Park, which sits on the former estate of war correspondent George Alfred Townsend. Townsend, who wrote under the name Gath during the Civil War, had the impressive War Correspondents Monument constructed in 1896. Still standing, it was the first monument in the world dedicated to journalists killed in combat.While the War Correspondents Monument is a fitting memorial and quite grand, I found my lesson for today at the nearby remnants of Townsend's mausoleum. The sign outside says:""During the 19th Century few people bought burial lots in public cemeteries as we do today. Instead, a small parcel of their own land was usually set aside as a private cemetery. If enough money was available, a mausoleum (tomb) was often built for certain family members. Gath, concerned with his own burial, built this lonely tomb about 20 years before his death, which came on April 15, 1914, in New York City. By this time his great wealth had dwindled and a near penniless Gath was buried in a Philadelphia, PA, cemetery instead of his own tomb as he had desired. Gath's empty tomb mutely symbolizes the uncertainties of life, fame, and fortune and the certainty of death.""The expensive, empty tomb of a once rich man who died nearly penniless reminded me of Matthew 6:19-21 which reads, ""Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.""As I headed for the Gathland State Park exit, I stumbled upon a pavilion with...Trail Magic! A gentleman in a wheelchair from a local veterans group was serving hot dogs, chips, drinks and other assorted goodies. Well done, sir.I exited the park and continued my journey along South Mountain, an area rich in American Civil War history. The Battle of South Mountain is considered one of the most decisive events in the war, as it was the key battle in Confederate General Robert E. Lee's failed first attempt to invade the Union. Had the Confederates won on northern soil, Great Britain and France may have intervened on the South's behalf, and persuaded a war-weary north to negotiate a peace settlement.So at Turner's Gap, Fox's Gap, and Crampton's Gap (Gathland State Park), I was hiking on the hallowed ground where approximately 6,100 soldiers were killed, wounded, or went missing in a single day. This reality was brought home as I stood in front of the memorial marking the spot near where Confederate Brigadier General Samuel Garland fell mortally wounded while leading his men. It's interesting that the military general who valiantly and selflessly led his men in battle ends up with a nice memorial tombstone for all to see. Meanwhile, the fancy tomb set aside by a man to honor himself is now in ruins and empty.After a 17.2 mile day, I ended up camping near the Dahlgren Campground. A female camper about my age approached me and started watching me set up my tent.Female: ""I hope you don't mind me watching you. I'm fairly new at this and I have a Big Agnes tent also.""Fob: ""No problem at all. I've set it up many times and I love it.""Female: ""So, you're a thru-hiker?""Fob: ""I will be when I summit Katahdin. Right now I'm just an aspiring thru-hiker. You have to earn the title.""Female: ""My trail name is Ru. That's 1/2 of Thru because I'm trying to hike half of the trail this year. There's no way I can do the whole thing yet.""Fob: ""I'm Fob. My youngest son poops on trails.""Ru: ""Hmmm.""Fob: ""It's a long story. So where are you from?""Ru: ""I'm a retired sheriff's deputy from Riverview, Florida.""Fob: ""No way! My wife and I lived in Fishhawk for seven years, just down the road from you! You've probably given me a traffic ticket!""Ru: ""Wow! Small world.""Fob: ""And then you put in the final stake, at an angle, just like this.""Ru: ""I'm impressed. Your Big Agnes is so taut.""Fob: ""I get that a lot.""As I laid there alone in my tent in the woods, I remembered that I was just west of Burkittsville, Maryland. Why does that matter? Well, it was in the woods near Burkittsville where they filmed parts of the original Blair Witch Project movie. Yes, folks, I was in the Blair Witch Woods! As it got dark, my initial inclination was to make a scary, Blair Witch Project-like video and post it on Facebook, so I did. For some reason the volume wasn't on, so the video will mainly seem scary to those who read lips. I was a little spooked myself, and went to sleep that night wondering if any witches would bother me in the middle of the night.That night I had the strangest dream...Blair, a witch, hovered outside my tent, along with Sarah, her reluctant sister. How did I know she was a witch? Because she looked like one...she had a crooked nose. Sensing my fear and vulnerability, Blair ripped open my (tent) fly and snatched me. I was so scared. She and Sarah took me to their coven next to a Hogwarts looking castle owned by their rich father, Big Daddy Warlock. (These are the kind of dreams you have when there's too much granola in your diet.).Blair put me in a cage down the hall, gave me a handful of oats to eat, and left me alone with Sarah. ""Watch out for my sister,"" Sarah warned. ""She's gone, but she'll be back, and she's a man eater. Watch out, Fob, she'll chew you up!"" ""Say it isn't so,"" I replied. ""I can't go for that. No can do. I need to get back on the trail."" Just then Blair, clearly out of touch, returned and hit me with a stick. One on one, I was no match for her. I said, ""You're a witch, girl, and you've gone too far, 'cause you know it don't matter anyway.""Blair left again to prepare her witches stew, which calls for the eye of a newt, a pinch of garlic, and a Fob. It's a primitive recipe, but she's never had any adult education. I looked at Sarah and said, ""This is my last chance. Can you help me escape?""{My dream was interrupted by an urgent need to pee in a bottle, so I did. I then returned to my dream.}Sarah replied, ""Helping you is risky. Even though Blair is gone, her private eyes are watching you. They watch your every move."" I said, ""Help me escape, and you'll make my dreams come true."" ""But, Fob, I like having you around,"" she admitted. ""Every time you go away, you take a piece of me with you."" ""Don't worry, Sarah,"" I said softly. ""Your kiss is on my list for the rest of my life.""With tears in her eyes, Sarah reached out her warty hand and placed it on my shoulder...Sarah: ""If you feel like leaving, you know you can go...""Fob: ""I feel like leaving.""Sarah: ""But why don't you stay until tomorrow?""Fob: ""Actually, now is fine. I just heard a newt scream.""Sarah: ""And if you wanna be free...""Fob: ""I really do. I hear Blair coming.""Sarah: ""All you have to do is say so.""Fob: ""So.""Just then, Sarah unlocked my cage and I made a run for it. As I exited the coven towards safety, I looked back over my shoulder at a crying Sarah and said, ""It's you...and me...forever! Sarah, smile...oh won't you smile awhile for me, Sarah.""I awoke from my dream in cold sweat. It had been a memorable night in the Blair Witch Woods, but it was time to eat a granola bar, put on some more 80s music, and hike on.Fob","Bolling AFB, DC

The 34-foot tall Washington Monument tower, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, honors our nation's founding father and first President. It was also used as a signal station by Union forces during the Civil War. I climbed to the top for a terrific 360 degree view. As I hiked down Monument Knob, I met a hiker aptly named Trouble heading southbound. His backpack was busted wide open and, sadly, he was returning to Harpers Ferry to get a new one. At mile 1045.3 I crossed the I-70 footbridge and then US 40.The temperature continued to climb throughout the day, as did the humidity. I was sweating as profusely as I can ever remember, and there weren't even any major hills to climb. Then the gnats came, first a few and then in swarms. It became obvious to me that ear sweat is crack cocaine for gnats, and I was the AT's biggest dealer. For the first time on my journey, I donned my head net and watched the flying pests circle my head in frustration.After a 20.2 mile day I stealth camped at mile 1060.5.

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542094,"Day 96As expected, it rained much of the night and into the morning. I slept in and finally broke camp to clear skies at 11:15 a.m. A few miles into my day, I arrived at Pen Mar County Park. I glanced over at a pavilion and saw there was Trail Magic! Yes, some dear ladies and children from a local Methodist church were providing sandwiches, fruit, and drinks to us weary hikers. It's interesting that I got trail magic (on the trail) twice in Maryland (40 AT miles), which is the same number of times I got it in all of Virginia (550 AT miles). The only negative at this stop was a rude park employee who was giving them a hard time for setting up there, even though no one was using it and there was only a handful of people in the park. Come on, man!Shortly after exiting the park, I crossed some railroad tracks and reached the Pennsylvania border and the Mason Dixon line! I'm anxious to see how trail towns, trail magic, and people in general differ in the northern AT states. It didn't take long to find out. Just 2.6 miles into Pennsylvania, at the crossing for PA 16, there was a cooler full of cold sodas and a box full of bags of chips. As I sat there eating Cheetos and drinking a Mountain Dew, it occurred to me that this was Pennsylvania's way of saying, ""I'm about to rip your feet and shoes to shreds with miles and miles of sharp rocks, so go ahead and have a soda and snack on me."" Then it occurred to me that states don't actually talk.Late in the day, at mile 1072.3, I stopped at the crowded, popular, side-by-side Tumbling Run Shelters. I saw a few familiar faces, including Brief Thief, along with several section hiking teenagers. The caretakers for the shelter were there talking to hikers and giving out cold, Trail Magic sodas! They live nearby and have been checking on and maintaining these shelters for more than twenty-five years. I got water at the stream that runs by the shelter. As I sat there on a rock, a crayfish surfaced, climbed a few inches on the small rock next to me, looked over at me, and then headed back into the water to tell his family about a Fob sighting. He would have been good boiled with hot sauce.Since the shelters and surrounding tent sites were pretty crowded, I hiked on up the hill towards Chimney Rocks. About halfway up the hill, as I planted my foot on a rock, I slipped and fell on my side. This was my first fall on the actual AT with backpack on and trekking poles in use. Fortunately, I didn't injure anything. I just got back up, called myself an ""idiot"" in my Napoleon Dynamite voice, and kept climbing.Up at Chimney Rocks, mile 1073.6, I set up my tent after a 13.1 mile day. I hung my bear bag and then crawled into my tent at 8 p.m. At 8:40 p.m. heavy rain began to fall and was projected to last until mid-morning.Fob","Stealth Camp, mile 1060.5

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542186,"""Each of us makes his own weather, determines the color of the skies in the emotional universe which he inhabits."" - Fulton J. SheenDay 97After the Bible, the two books which have had the greatest impact on my life are Crazy Love by Francis Chan and The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by the late Stephen Covey. I've read Covey's book many times and have even incorporated it into a high school Leadership class I used to teach. For some reason, I just connect with the principles in the book and find them highly practical in everyday life. I have also found them useful out here on the AT.Habit 2 is to Begin With the End in Mind. Whether you are starting a career, building an engine, or baking a cake, you start by visualizing what you want it to look like at the end. I illustrated this to my class by having them work together on a 1000-piece puzzle without looking at the picture on the box. It's not very motivating sorting through puzzle pieces for hours when you don't know what you're making. Once the picture on the box is revealed, the students gain focus and intensity because they know what they're working toward.Covey also suggests closing your eyes and imagining being at a funeral. You look around and see your family, friends, coaches, co-workers, etc. You then realize it's your own funeral. As each of them takes the podium to speak about you, what do you want them to say? Given that, how do you need to live your life now in order for them to be able to say those things one day? That's beginning (even starting today!) with the end (of your earthly life) in mind.This principle plays out in at least two important ways on the AT. At the macro level, I have envisioned what it will be like to summit Katahdin and earn the thru-hiker title over and over again. That final prize is very motivating so I keep it in the forefront of my mind and think about it often. With that vision of the end firmly in place, I can work backwards to plan my rough timeline, gear that I'll need, and many other things.At the micro level, I begin each day with the projected end of the day in mind. If I want to get to x location, when do I need to depart? How much water will I need and where will I find it? Do I need to hit a trail town to resupply? Having a projected target in mind is more motivating to me than just hiking out in the morning with no plan.My target today...the end that I had in mind...was Caledonia State Park. It had several things going for it, including a public swimming pool, concessions stand, bathrooms, water source, etc. Focusing on it would make my 97th day of hiking more purposeful. I once again got a late start due to rain, but was on the trail by 10:00 a.m. It took me a little under four hours to make the soggy 8.7 mile journey to the park.With a thunderstorm approaching, I arrived at the park just in time to hear the lifeguards blow the whistle to clear the pool. There would be swimming for Fob this day. Outside the concession stand, several hikers were already seated and devouring lunch. I met Count, Doc, Patches, Boss, and Sam Squanch. Boss and Sam Squanch are a 20-something adorable girlfriend-boyfriend team from the United Kingdom. I absolutely love their accents and would be very content just listening to them read a phone book out loud.After ordering my cheeseburger, hot dog, French fries, and Mountain Dew, there was a long thunder roll and a heavy rain began to fall. The lady running the concession stand said, ""We're hiker friendly here. You all come on in to stay dry."" God bless her soul! We all entered the side door with our gear and food and spread out on the floor and some chairs. I was seated next to the ice cream freezer and ordered a large one after finishing off my food. As the rain continued to fall, we sat around getting to know each other and just enjoying the moment. After about an hour Tyler, the cook, told us it was time to close the grill and he had several hot dogs left over. ""Do you want them?,"" he asked. In unison we answered, ""Yes!"" and divided them amongst ourselves.The rain eventually stopped and I made my way over to the swimming pool bathrooms to freshen up. There were several lifeguards walking around in red Baywatch swimsuits which was a little overwhelming for a guy who has been living in the woods for three months. After getting water, I got back on the trail heading north. I stopped by the nice, but crowded, Quarry Gap Shelters and visited with Tree Beard, Waterfall, and Training Wheels. A few miles later, after a 15.5 mile day, I stopped at the Three Points campsite, mile 1089.1. I set up my tent and ate some tortillas with pepperoni and Swiss cheese. Just after getting into my tent, the rain once again began to fall.The day didn't turn out exactly like I had planned it. The final puzzle didn't match the picture on the box. There was no basking in the sun after a refreshing dip in the pool. And yet, eating leftover hot dogs and ice cream with other stinking hikers in a concession stand kitchen during a torrential downpour will always be a great, great memory. In fact, looking back now, I'd say it was even better than the picture on the box.Fob","Stealth Camp, Chimney Rocks

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542382,"""It takes an endless amount of history to make even a little tradition."" - Henry James""Tradition does not mean that the living are dead, it means that the dead are living."" - Henry MacMilanDay 98One of the neatest aspects of hiking the AT is taking part in longstanding trail traditions. Using a trail name, writing confessions at The Priest Shelter, hanging my feet off McAfee Knob and having my photo taken at ATC Headquarters are among the traditions I've participated in so far on my journey. By doing so, I connect myself in time with the hikers who have gone before me and those who will come later.Day 98 was special for two reasons. First, I crossed the official AT midpoint at mile 1094.5. I stopped for a picture, said a prayer, and ate a candy bar. That's how I roll.The even bigger event, though, was strolling into Pine Grove Furnace State Park...home of The Half Gallon Challenge! This was perhaps the AT tradition I was most looking forward to. I have read many, many stories of past hikers who have taken the challenge and either passed or failed. I was incredibly hungry. I had spent my whole life eating ice cream to prepare for this moment. And if that weren't motivation enough, those who conquer the challenge get a tiny wooden spoon with ""Half Gallon Challenge"" written on it. I wanted that little spoon very badly.There was also the issue of a recent hot dog eating contest at a minor league baseball game. My youngest son, B.W Pot, represented Harding University against a contestant from another school. With a crowd of supporters cheering him on, he not only took second (aka last) place but managed to consume zero (0) hot dogs! Apparently he started laughing and choking and couldn't get a single hot dog down in 30 seconds. Not one. For a family with a proud history of overeating, this was not acceptable. Tears were shed and we considered cutting off his share of the inheritance. He's a good kid, though, and will probably bounce back from this and have a productive life.So I arrived at the General Store focused on restoring the family honor and earning a tiny wooden spoon. Surprisingly, of the nine or ten other hikers there, only two others attempted the challenge with one (Hawaii) succeeding and one (Long Strider) failing. I selected my first flavor, 1.5 quarts of cookies and cream. There's no official time limit, you just have to do it in ""one sitting"". Still, I wanted to complete the challenge in under an hour. I worked methodically as various hikers and vacationers looked on. About half way through, I belched and took a short breather. I struck up a conversation with five Pennsylvania teens who come to the park with their dads every year to celebrate Fathers Day (another cool tradition). One of the teens told me that his dad comes up with a challenge for them each year, and they earn money if they complete the challenge. This year his dad brought live goldfish in a tub and later that night the boys would be bobbing for goldfish. If they get a live goldfish in their mouth, they get $20. If they swallow it, they get $50. I said, ""Dude, sounds like you have a pretty cool dad."" He smiled and said, ""Yeah I do.""I finished off the 1.5 quarts of cookies and cream, belched loudly, and moved on to the .5 quart of raspberry ice cream. I was already beyond full and it had the look and consistency of Barney's diarrhea. 35 minutes had elapsed and pressure was building on several levels. On my third bite of purple mush I cracked the little plastic spoon they give you and had to get a new one. With .2 quarts to go, I hit the 42 minute mark. I felt queasy and began to lactate from my armpits and brow. With just a few bites remaining, the teens and some of the hikers gathered around me shouting ""Fob! Fob! Fob!"" I dug deep. I put the team on my back. And I finished the ice cream! I conquered the half gallon challenge in 48 minutes! I restored the family's overeating honor! Ten minutes later, I went back in and ordered a quesadilla and ate it with no problem. I probably could have eaten even more, but I wanted to save room for a goldfish.As I sat there with my stomach tossing and turning, a young lady from Shippensburg University approached me and asked if she could interview me. She is working on her degree in Sociology and is doing a big research project on aspiring AT thru hikers. I agreed and she hit me with a wide variety of questions for about fifteen minutes. About every third question, I leaned forward in my chair and silently broke wind, without breaking my train of thought. As she recorded my answers, a faint whiff of rotting raspberries permeated the air around us. Thankfully, ""Did you just Barney fart?"" wasn't on her list of questions.In no condition to hike, I called it a 12.6 mile day and decided to stay at the nearby historic Ironmasters Mansion Hostel. $33 got me dinner and breakfast, laundry service, a hot shower and a bed to sleep on. The mansion was built in 1829 for Peter Ege, the longest serving ironmaster at Pine Grove Furnace. Later, they believe the mansion was a stop on the Underground Railroad. The caretaker even showed me the secret trapdoor that leads to a basement where there are tunnels exiting the property.Later, some late arriving hikers told me that Sam Squanch, the U.K. hiker I rode out a storm with in a concession stand, had just conquered the One Gallon Challenge, which I didn't even know existed. The record for consuming a full gallon of ice cream had been broken the previous Sunday after standing for 12 years. The old record was 48 minutes and a fellow hiker named Legs did it in 28 minutes. Sam Squanch, determined to outdo his friend Legs, broke it again with a time of 24 minutes! He basically ate twice as much ice cream as me in half the time. Afterward he went to the bathroom and vomited but they still gave him credit. He's probably the most accomplished Brit since Austin Powers.Later that evening, hikers were hanging out in the dining area, the parlor, and the bunk rooms. Mountain Goat, a 20-something Australian hiker, sat down at the piano and began to play. She was magnificent and the songs were mesmerizing. In fact, every hiker stopped what they were doing and listened. Some walked to the edge of the doorway to watch her play. It reminded me of the scene in The Shawshank Redemption where Andy finds a record of two Italian opera singers singing The Marriage of Figaro. He locks himself in the warden's office and plays the beautiful song on the prison's loud speaker. The prisoners and guards alike stop what they're doing and listen in awe. My fellow hikers and I were in awe listening to Mountain Goat play the piano. After being in the uncultured wilderness for so long, it was quite the treat to hear her play and feel normal for a change.Fob","Three Points Campsite

The most salient characteristic of life is its urgency, ""here and now"" without any possible postponement. Life is fired at us point-blank."" - Jose Ortega y GassetDay 99Still a tad hung over from the ice cream challenge, I hiked out shirtless to face the heat and rocks. I once thought that Pennsylvania's reputation for having excessive trail rocks was probably a little exaggerated. Surely it can't be that bad. Well, it's starting to get that bad. I don't mind the climbs or scrambles over large boulder fields. My long legs are made for that. What is challenging are the sections with sharp little pointed rocks everywhere. There are several mile long stretches where every step is some sort of rock pointing up. This puts a beat down on your shoes and feet, not to mention your attitude and mileage. The other consequence is that you're having to always look down to watch your step and choose the hopefully less painful rock to step on. So you tend to miss some of the trail scenery around you. I won't continue complaining about the rocks as that affects my attitude and doesn't change anything. It is what it is and I have to take the bad with the good.Towards the end of the day I broke out into a clearing and walked a few miles across pastures and corn fields. The sun was pounding down on me mercilessly. After 18.9 difficult miles, I stopped at the Backpackers Campsite on the outskirts of Boiling Springs. It's cool that they've established this little campsite with a port-a-potty in the woods right outside the town. The only downside is that it is within an easy stones throw of a very active railroad track. Like a Bruce Springsteen song, I was going to wake up at night ""with the sheets soaking wet, and a freight train running the middle of my head.""After setting up camp, I made two phones calls and left two messages to designated points of contact at a local church, hoping to get a ride the next day. Neither were ever returned. I then walked less than a mile into beautiful downtown Boiling Springs. I had driven through the town years earlier with Janet and it was every bit as pretty as I remembered it. I walked around the lake and stopped for a lasagna dinner at Anile's Italian restaurant. I then stopped at Getty Food Mart to resupply my food stock. I returned to camp at sunset to the loud roar of a passing train. With my earplugs in, a tired body, and a belly full of lasagna, the occasional train roar didn't keep me from sleeping well that night.Fob","Ironmasters Mansion Hostel

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542632,"""Do not wait for leaders; do it alone, person to person."" - Mother TeresaDay 100I woke up and pulled out the sleeve of mini powdered donuts I'd purchased in Boiling Springs. After eating the first two, I noticed the third one was covered in mold. Bummer! It will be awhile before I'll be able to eat mini powdered donuts again. I broke camp, hiked back into Boiling Springs, took a few more pictures near the lake, and then hiked out of town.The next ten miles out of Boiling Springs were as flat a section as you'll find on the AT. If the elevation profile in my guidebook was a heart monitor, the patient would be dead. About one third of the day's miles were in open pastures and fields. I loved the change of scenery, but that also exposed me to several hours of continuous sunshine. By early afternoon, at mile 1131.3, I arrived at the Scott Farm Trail ATC Crew Headquarters. It provides hikers with a much needed water spigot, port-a-potty, and picnic table next to an old barn. I stripped down to my underwear, got down on all fours, and took a cold, refreshing 20-second shower under the water spigot. I felt like a dog but that's not a bad thing sometimes.After a long afternoon battling rocks (which I'm not going to complain about) I arrived at the Cove Mountain Shelter. After hiking 22 miles, much of it in the open sun, I was completely exhausted. At the shelter I met Allan, a hiker from Colorado in his 70s. We were the only two there that night. After returning from my long downhill hike to get water, he told me about some of his many hiking adventures.I was sitting on the ledge of the shelter when Allan returned from getting water. As we continued talking, Allan began taking off his clothes by the picnic table, just ten feet from my position. As he contrasted the AT with the PCT, he shed his underwear and stood before me completely naked. I've been in plenty of locker rooms and have seen plenty of naked men (myself included), but never one alone at a campsite in the Pennsylvania woods. It was awkward to the power of infinity.He continued, ""You won't find pointy trail rocks out west on the PCT like you find here in PA. They won't allow it."" He then grabbed a washcloth and his Nalgene bottle and began giving himself a sponge bath! It reminded me of what my 80-year-old Uncle Phil would look like naked and bathing himself in the woods, although that's something I try never to imagine. As he spoke, he raised his privates with one hand and ran the wet washcloth under them with the other. He took the unfortunate washcloth to regions of his body I had only seen diagrams of in 8th grade Health class. I didn't know whether to maintain eye contact (appropriate when someone is talking to you), or look away (appropriate when someone is determined to sponge off every single body crevice). I started to ask if he and his washcloth were enjoying the hike up Gooch Gap, but it was obvious they were. Ultimately, I decided to look down, pick at my feet, and respond with the occasional ""Oh really? That's interesting.""The conversation and sponge bath finally and mercifully ended and we crawled into bunks at opposite ends of the shelter. I was tired and a little rattled. Allan was clean. Every single inch of him was clean. I'm sure of that.Fob","Backpackers Campsite Near Boiling Springs

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542820,"""He answered, 'I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.'"" - Adam, Genesis 3:10Day 101I was excited about the morning hike because I was headed to Duncannon, a trail town with a reputation of being hiker friendly. Unfortunately, timing is everything and Monday morning is not the time for a hiker to stroll into town. First stop was a popular breakfast place...closed on Mondays. Across the street was the famously run-down Doyle Hotel, a cross between a hiker hostel and a slum. I didn't need lodging and their famously good restaurant doesn't serve breakfast. Ice cream place...closed. Laundromat...doesn't exist. About the only thing open was a little mini-mart where I grabbed a banana and coffee and did some basic resupply. I asked the manager if there was a place in Duncannon that serves breakfast on a Monday morning. He looked at me as if I had asked for the secret password to unlock all bank vaults worldwide. I'm pretty sure he's the same guy who answers the phone when you call computer tech support.The AT then took me down the main drag, a residential street with no hiker services. At the far edge of town I found a campground...with no vending machines and no manager (was out on a shuttle run). I did find a bathroom and got water from the sink. Needless to say, Duncannon was a huge disappointment, although most of that was due to my Monday morning arrival. At least there were no sharp pointy rocks on the sidewalks.As I left town and crossed over a river, I saw a gas station that had a Subway. Yeah! I went there for a foot-long Spicy Italian and five cups of lemonade. Hiking on, I arrived at Clarks Ferry Shelter and cameled up because the guide showed limited water options for the next several miles. At the shelter I met a hiker named Deuces Wild. He told me he got that name because he poops 5-6 times per day. Lovely.At mile 1157.6, after 15 miles, I called it a day at the Peters Mountain Shelter. I met and talked to Fresh Breath and two lady hikers, Eggplant and Parmesan. As I laid there in the shelter that night, I remembered that tomorrow was the Summer Solstice, the first day of summer and longest day of the year. That also meant it would be Hike Naked Day, another AT tradition! Leave it to Fob to end up on Peters Mountain in the Peters Mountain Shelter on the eve of Hike Naked Day! Realistically, I had no plans to hike naked. I couldn't afford to have my swinging vine get poison ivy or get caught in my hip belt. Besides, hiking naked would be major eye pollution to my fellow hikers, including Eggplant and Parmesan who were tenting nearby. As an alternative, I decided to sleep naked, and so I did...on Peters Mountain...in the Peters Mountain Shelter.Fob","Cove Mountain Shelter

In short, it was a bust...no pun intended. I didn't see a single hiker that day, northbound or southbound, who was hiking in the buff. I learned later of one boyfriend-girlfriend team who night-hiked naked for a few hours in the dark.Today was a long, hot, rocky day. Rocksylvania opened up a small seam on the bottom of my trail shoes and I made a mental note that I would need a replacement pair soon. Near Rattling Run, mile 1168.3, I got some video of a deer as I walked by her, just a few feet away. My presence didn't bother her a bit.Throughout the day I heard the occasional sounds of distant explosions. I assumed I must be near some sort of military training base, and that would turn out to be true (Fort Indiantown Gap, an Army post). At mile 1171, near Yellow Springs Village Site, an old coal mining settlement, I saw my friend Tree laying in his hammock between two trees by the side of the trail. On a trail where it seems far too many hikers are focused on obtaining big mile days and finishing the AT quickly, I love to see a young guy chilling in his hammock and reading a book in the shade in the middle of the afternoon. He's enjoying the journey and hasn't gotten caught up in the competitive mindset of who hiked the most miles that day or finished the trail the quickest.After an 18.5 mile, Hike Clothed Day, I stealth camped near Rausch Creek at mile 1176.1. Rausch Gap was a coal mining town that began, flourished, and died between 1830 and 1910. Today, all that remains are some building foundations and a small cemetery near where I camped.

Best Western won the bidding war, and was right next to a Subway, Wendy's, and Burger King. This was going to be a high calorie stay!

After breakfast at Wendy's, I grabbed a Subway sub for later and re-supplied at a gas station food mart. I really didn't want to walk 2+ non-AT miles back to the trailhead. Fortunately, two Air Force Master Sergeants walked into the store. That was just the break I needed. Airmen have been helping me out since 1988 and I was about to call on them again. ""Excuse me, MSgt Corl, I was wondering if there is any chance you and your friend could give a ride to a retired Air Force guy who is hiking the AT."" He replied, ""Maybe...you're not a mass murderer are you?"" ""I'll be on my best behavior,"" I answered.

In addition to being communicators with the 193 Special Operations Wing, they are now officially Trail Angels.The day was mostly overcast, weedy and, of course, rocky. I ripped a part of the fabric on the upper side of my left shoe, and the right heel continued to peel along the edge. After 11.4 miles, I hiked into the very lively and full 501 Shelter near PA 501. This shelter is 4-sided with a solar shower. The nearby caretaker's house has a water spigot and outside electrical outlets. In addition to all that, a local pizza place delivers to the shelter. I arrived too late to order pizza, but accepted my fellow hikers' offer to finish off some leftovers.The shelter was full of hikers including Mountain Goat (the Aussie piano player) and Pinto/TinkTank (the daughter of my sister Ellen's friend). I overheard one hiker say, ""Poor Two Pack got Giardia. He went into town for meds but returned quicker than the doc recommended. That night he diarrhea'd all over himself, his tent, and his gear. The next morning he threw away everything soiled, gave away the rest, and quit the trail for good.""

These are the folks whose daughter was engaged to an AT thru-hiker (trail name Jay-Bird) who died from cancer a couple of years after hiking the trail. He never got a chance to be a Trail Angel so, in his memory, the Werners provide Trail Magic each May in Virginia. After I wrote about them, DeAnn contacted me and offered to take me out to eat whenever I got to their home state of Pennsylvania. Honestly, I thought it sweet of her to offer, but doubted it would ever materialize.I've since learned never to doubt the sincerity or intentions of the amazing Werners. They tracked my progress across several states and offered to drive more than an hour to meet me at Port Clinton. I made a steep, waterfall descent into the town and walked across several railroad tracks. Next to them were the famous and massive Reading anthracites. I crossed over a bridge into Port Clinton and immediately saw Dave and DeAnn waiting for me. It was so great to see them and the cooler of cold drinks they had with them! Dave said, ""This day is all about you. We have all the time in the world. Tell us where you want to go. And we have room for one or two more if you see any other hikers.""Port Clinton had a community yard sale going on and our first stop was at a booth manned by the Blue Mountain Eagle Climbing Club. These are the trail maintainers for this region and they appreciated having an aspiring thru-hiker stop by. After eating a hot dog and Coke, we started heading out of town when I spotted a hiker on the corner. I didn't know him but had a hunch what he wanted. With the Werners' permission, I rolled down the window and asked if he needed a ride to Cabela's. ""Heck yeah,"" he said and hopped in. We introduced ourselves and learned that his name is ET, because he has an extra toe. We headed to the largest Cabela's store in the world in Hamburg where I purchased a new pair of Salomon XA Pro 3D trail shoes. Our next stop was Hoss's Steak and Sea restaurant where the Werners insisted on buying ET and me a steak dinner, salad bar, and dessert bar. I was thrilled and ET was in a state of shock as this was Trail Magic of the highest order.After stuffing our faces, we headed to a local grocery store to re-supply our food. As I was about to check out, DeAnn cut in front of me and paid for my groceries. She didn't want to hear any of my objections. She said, ""Fob, you hike the trail. We do food. We want to do this for you, so let us do it."" I wasn't going to win that battle so I thanked her and accepted her generous gift. The Werners then returned us to Port Clinton where we thanked them again and said our goodbyes. As I reflect on the day, I can't find the words to express how much their kindness meant to me. They made ET and me, a couple of stinky hikers, feel like royalty. My only regret is that I never got to meet and know Jay-Bird before he died. He would be happy to know his trail legacy lives on through Dave and DeAnn, two of the kindest people I've ever met.I made the steep climb out of Port Clinton and camped with ET and a friendly, section hiking couple from California. Altogether, we had three tents, two cook stoves, and forty-one toes. I had logged 11.2 miles. More importantly, I had seen a real life example of a couple going way beyond the call of duty to help someone they barely know. I hope Janet and I can be that kind of couple in the years ahead.Fob","Near Eagles Nest Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543363,"Day 107A few miles into my morning hike I traveled through Windsor Furnace, the site of a furnace dating back to 1768. This region of the Appalachian Mountains possesses limestone deposits, iron ore, and hardwoods. Consequently, furnaces sprang up to produce iron for the colonists and later for American Civil War combatants. Pennsylvania alone had over 500 furnaces or forges. Later, Americans discovered Home Depot and the furnaces were shut down.At mile 1224.5 I reached Pulpit Rock, an outcropping with a pretty view and the Pulpit Rock Astronomical Park nearby. I stripped down to just my hiking shorts, hung my remaining sweaty clothes on a tree branch, and laid down for 30-minute nap. When I woke up and stood up, my body sweat had created an outline on the rock, like a crime scene. A mile later, several other hikers and I missed the side trail to The Pinnacle and its panoramic view. Surprisingly, there was no sign to indicate the turnoff to this scenic spot, as you find at many famous vistas.Near Panther Creek, mile 1230.2, I saw my first AT rattlesnake! Yes! He was about 40 inches long and just off the trail. We respected each other's personal space and thus neither of us felt the need to rattle.After a 12 mile day, I arrived at the Eckville Shelter on Hawk Mountain Road. I decided to call it an early day because this shelter had a shower and flush toilet nearby. After 3+ months on the trail, I find it quite fascinating and special to be able to pull a lever and watch my waste swirl around and disappear like magic. It's a luxury we take for granted in our society. Upon arrival, I saw the freshly showered Pocahontas hiking out to do some more miles. Long Strider, Torch, One Feather and a few others also stayed at or near the shelter that night. Torch is a recent high school graduate attempting a flip flop hike...Harpers Ferry to Maine and then Harpers Ferry to Georgia. He wants to study Aerospace Engineering and become a pilot or join the military or both. I shared some of my Air Force experiences with him.Long Strider and I were hungry for pizza and set out to find a place that would deliver to Hawk Mountain Road. We called several places within a 20 mile radius and struck out time and time again. Bummed, I took a shower and flushed the toilet because I could. I also told myself that someday I was going to return and deliver a pizza to this shelter, like I so wish someone had done for me on my 107th night on the AT.Fob","Campsite, Mile 1220

They are your big chance!"" - Fritz ReinerDay 108Today was another long, hot, rocky day. Don't even get me started on the rocks. I started to switch to my new Salomon trail shoes but decided to stick with my current ones awhile longer because I wanted to get through Rocksylvania on them and they were still minimally serviceable.This desire to get that last ounce of service out of a product runs in my family. My parents taught my sisters and I how to be thrifty and hoard things. I have fond memories of my mom discreetly stuffing her purse with salad bar crackers before we'd leave a restaurant. I guess she figured that if you do that over a lifetime, you might have to buy one or two less boxes of Saltines. I once looked in the freezer belonging to Ellen, my oldest sister, and found frozen Halloween candy from six years earlier! Nothing satisfies the sweet tooth like a 6-year-old frozen piece of Bit-O-Honey.And then there's my dad, bless his heart. I've never seen such a wide variety of stuff, ranging from junk to really nice antiques, in one house. He and my mom were masterful flea market, yard sale, and thrift store shoppers. Last summer I tried to help him clean out the garage, and the conversation went something like this...Fob: So, dad, I noticed you have four new toilet seats in the garage.Dad: Yes, got them at an auction several years ago. They were in a box of goodies.Fob: In the interest of downsizing and cleaning out, I was thinking maybe we could get rid of three of them. What do you think?Dad: Hmmm. Well, we have three toilets in the house, and these things can break.Fob: Yes, but is it likely you would need to replace all of the toilet seats?Dad: I don't know, but if I do, I'll have them, plus a spare.Fob: But what if you just went to Wal-Mart and bought a new toilet seat whenever you need one?Dad: That wouldn't make sense because I have four in the garage.Needless to say, we didn't do much downsizing. And then there was the time our old toaster died when I was in high school. Rather than just go buy a new one, Dad went to his massive filing cabinets and came back an hour later with what appeared to be the Magna Carta. Unfortunately, the yellow, faded warranty had expired twenty years earlier and he was forced to get a new toaster. He placed the old toaster in the garage next to four new toilet seats. With this family history and genetics, I'll be carrying my new hiking shoes until the current ones totally and completely die.Speaking of warranties, I stopped at the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter to make some phone calls related to gear issues. Thanks to Rocksylvania, one trekking pole tip was completely gone and the other was about halfway rubbed off. A nice lady from Leki's customer support team said she's send me new tips free of charge. Also, near the center hub on my tent frame, one of the extensions has started to crack. I can still set up the frame and tent using the emergency sleeve, but I'd rather not do that for the rest of my hike. So I called Big Agnes and they are sending me a new frame. Once you tell a hiking gear company you're an aspiring thru-hiker, they will generally bend over backwards to remedy your situation. The only other noteworthy event at this shelter stop was meeting a friendly hiker named Calorie. He is the first African American aspiring thru hiker I've met on the trail so far, and earned his name due to a tendency to know and share the number of calories in his food.Late in the afternoon, the wind started picking up and I heard thunder. I checked my weather app and sure enough, a big storm was heading toward me. I estimated I had 30 minutes before it was right on top of me. I was on rocky, uneven terrain, still four miles from the next shelter. Even worse, I was one mile from the dangerous, narrow rocky ledge known as Knife Edge. This was a really bad situation to be in. I was mad at myself for not having enough situational awareness on the storm while I still had good options. Now all of my options were varying degrees of bad. I just wanted to blink my eyes and be home next to my wife, eating popcorn and watching a Netflix movie. Or have it be a video game, where you just run your doomed character off a cliff, knowing you have three more lives. I only have one life to work with.I decided to hike as fast as I possibly could on the rocks and try to get over Knife Edge before the storm hit. This decision fell somewhere between gutsy and stupid, but I couldn't come up with a better one. I quickly approached Knife Edge just as the first rain drops started to fall. I didn't panic, per se, but my heart rate was way up and I said, ""God, please get me through this."" I scrambled over the narrow rock ledge as quickly as I could in those conditions. I took five minutes getting through a section that would normally have taken me at least twice that time in safe and careful hiking mode. Just as I cleared the worst part of Knife Edge, the rain began to pour. I sought refuge by sitting under a large boulder at the edge of Knife Edge, which kept the rain off my head but not my knees and feet. I never saw lightning, but there was plenty of thunder and very heavy rain. I took a selfie to capture the moment, although a picture won't be necessary for me to remember this crisis.After sitting under the boulder in the rain for five minutes, I realized I was already completely soaked to the bone from rain and sweat, and was starting to get a chill from the drop in temperature. I decided my best move was to hike on in the storm, but to move slowly due to the slick rocks literally all over the trail. I was willing to risk falling in order to get to the shelter and not remain under a boulder getting chilled.Just as I emerged, I heard, ""What's up, Fob?"" Shocked, I turned around to see Hammer descending from Knife Edge in the downpour. I turned and said, ""Hammer! Good to have somebody here to die with!"" We smiled at each other, recognizing we were in a horrible predicament. Yet, oddly, we both felt a sense of relief knowing we were not alone. He said, ""After you, sir..."" and I headed out over the rocky trail, in a downpour, with Hammer just a few paces behind me. For the next hour, we hiked in heavy to moderate rain over all sorts of rock scrambles. We talked the whole way and, at least for me, that took some of the sting out of the situation.The rain finally stopped just before we arrived at (Easy) Bake Oven Knob Shelter. Long Strider and a few other hikers were already there, seeking refuge from the rain under the shelter. Hammer and I made a really long and steep downhill hike to get water, and then set up our tents and hung up our wet clothes. Before sunset, a late arriving hiker stumbled into the shelter with a bleeding leg and some other scrapes. He made it through the wet and dangerous Knife Edge but then fell on a slick rock moments later. We helped him out with an antibiotic and bandage for his leg wound, after he rinsed it with contact lens solution.It had been a tough, physically and emotionally draining, 17.4 mile day on the Appalachian Trail. The phrase ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"" seems to apply here. Persevering and overcoming situations like this makes us mentally tougher and bonds us together. When the next storm comes, real or figurative, maybe I'll be better positioned to overcome it, knowing I overcame this one. Maybe I'll know to check the weather forecast more regularly. Maybe I'll remember to ask God for help again. In life you and I can only dodge so many storms. Eventually, we're going to be in one. Maybe you're in one now. In the midst of the storm, when hope starts to fade, I try to remember that somehow, some way, God is going to get me through it and will use the situation to make me a better person.Fob","Eckville Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543725,"""Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind."" - Ecclesiastes 12:13""That's what a good wife does, keeps your dreams alive even when you don't believe any more."" - Michael J. Sullivan""Living the Christian life isn't always easy, but it's always worth it.""    - Sir Fob W. PotDays 109-111I awoke, packed up, ate a pop tart, and was ready to hike in just thirty minutes. I was highly motivated because today was...(drum roll)...rendezvous with Janet day! This would be our third and final get together during my AT hike. We chose the town of Slatington as our afternoon pickup point which meant I had a 7.3 mile downhill hike and she had a four hour drive from the DC area. The most notable thing on the hike was the presence of thousands of gypsy moths along the trail. To pass the time, I tried to see how many I could step on and eventually killed nineteen of the hardwood eating pests.There are basically three types of towns along the AT. The first are trail towns that the trail runs through that love and cater to hikers. Damascus, Virginia is an example of that. Hikers fuel their economy and they fuel hikers with their enthusiasm and support. The second type of trail town is off the trail some number of miles but still loves hikers and wants their business. They go out of their way to get hikers into town by offering free shuttles or posting the names of Trail Angels willing to offer rides. Franklin, North Carolina is an example from that category. The third category of town either doesn't care or outright doesn't want hikers in town. No attempt is made to help hikers get into town. I would put Slatington into this third category. The lady at the counter of the auto repair place at the trailhead was unfriendly and not interested in hikers using their restroom. If I were the owner, I would at least have a cooler of water outside for hikers or maybe a soda machine. How difficult would that be? No one offered a ride despite my hitching efforts. There were no signs about Trail Angels or town services. And to top it all off, the two mile walk into town was on a narrow, dangerous road to be hiking along.The only friendly or helpful person I encountered was the manager of the laundromat who was interested in my hike and glad to have my business. I'm not suggesting everyone living near the AT needs to bend over backwards to cater to hikers. I am suggesting that towns, especially those in economically challenged areas, could make a lot of money on the thousands of hikers who travel through each year. It's just interesting how some towns take advantage of their proximity to the trail and others seem pretty ambivalent.After doing laundry I walked across the town to a Chinese restaurant and got a plate of General Tsao chicken and two spring rolls. During my hour at the restaurant, I made four trips to the restroom, which may explain why some trail towns would prefer hikers just hike on by. After my fourth trip, Zhang Wei, the owner, emerged from the restroom saying, ""Nemo air freshna, some ting wong in air."" I quickly exited, crossed the street to a gas station, got an ice cream and a drink, and awaited the mid-afternoon arrival of my wife.I just have to say that I have the best wife! When I think back over my half century old life (something I've had plenty of time to do on the AT), I think I've made five really good decisions that have impacted my entire life. First and foremost, I decided that God is real and I needed to become a Christian. So I did. That's a decision you can't afford to get wrong, as eternity is riding on it. Second, I chose a Christian wife who I love and who loves me. More on that in a minute. Third, together we decided to raise our children in a Christian environment. That meant a lot of things, including teaching our children about God, regularly attending Bible class and worship services, and being heavily involved in church work. That gave (and continues to give) our lives purpose and generally puts us around pretty awesome friends who share similar values. Fourth, I chose careers, in the military, as a teacher, and as a youth minister, that have intrinsic value and involved helping people. I'm glad I never had to grudgingly work just to earn a paycheck, although I would have done that if necessary to feed my family. Finally, together we decided that the best way to spend the next chapter of our lives is serving others, rather than accumulating and maintaining possessions. Whether that takes the form of RV-based domestic mission work, building houses with Habitat, doing disaster relief, or overseas mission work, it really is just about helping others and letting God's love shine through us.I say all that not to pat ourselves on the back...we are sinners and we struggle with issues as individuals and as a family. We need God's grace just like everyone else. I say all that because I have run into a lot of young people out here, and a few older ones, who weren't raised in that sort of environment. Many are searching for something. For many, God is sort of an abstract concept and the Bible is certainly not something that needs to be followed. The feeling is you just sort of believe in some higher power and be a nice person and that's enough. Careers are often chosen based on income potential, with little regard to any larger purpose. Throw in a good looking spouse, a big house, fancy vacations, and ""fun friends"" and everything falls into place. Except that it frequently doesn't, at least not over the long haul. A life with self at the center, rather than God, is a life which may eventually leave a person feeling disillusioned or empty. Some of them are hiking the AT for just that reason. I know that because they've told me so. Some are asking the same question asked by a Jack Nicholson movie character, ""What if this is as good as it gets?"" Peggy Lee expressed a similar concern in her song, Is That All There Is?Several millennials I've spoken to have given up on religion because they've had bad experiences with boring, inactive churches that are in maintenance mode and aren't really engaging their community and world. I say try a different church. Go on a mission trip. Serve food at a homeless shelter. Focus not on what your church can do for you, but how you through your church can impact your community and world. If your faith is boring you're not doing it right!Hiking the AT and being out in nature for so long can and should point people to God and illuminate his creative power, rather than just be an end unto itself. My hope is that the many folks I've talked to on the trail who are searching for meaning will find it in a loving God and a relationship with Christ. If this post can help influence even one person out there to consider or reconsider a God-centered life, then it will have been worth it. If I could just convince one of these millennials, or anyone reading this, to give God and faith and church another try, then my AT hike will have been worth the effort. I pray that it will, and that God will help me to more fully and completely live the ideals I've just laid out. I'm still a work in progress.Back to Little Miss Janet, she is just an incredible wife! I feel like I won the marriage lottery and chose to have the prize spread out over a lifetime. We have been through a lot together...a miscarriage, her major kidney surgery, a robbery, a flooded house, the spandex pants she wore on Kyle and Laci's engagement day, multiple Air Force moves, my mom's illness, etc. She has always stood right by my side and held me up when life was making me wobble.How many wives let their husbands be gone for six months to hike the AT? She hasn't complained once or even hinted that I should consider quitting. How many wives let their husbands volunteer to deploy to Afghanistan for six months? How many are willing to be dragged all over the country and world, being uprooted every few years, as a military spouse? How many, when you ask, ""Hey, what if we got rid of almost everything and lived full-time in an RV?"" answer, ""Let's do it!"" She has been nothing but good and loving and supportive to me, and that theme would continue with our little rendezvous.After a wonderful gas station hug and kiss, she drove me to Pamela's Forget Me Not Bed and Breakfast in Kempton, PA. Instead of wearing the usual yellow springy dress, she purchased a yellow nighty thing that made my jaw drop. (She wore it later that night, not at the gas station.) We spent three wonderful nights there, enjoying the jacuzzi tub, delicious breakfasts, and just being together. As with our previous rendezvous, she restored me and made me feel normal and whole again, if only for a short while.While out running errands, we went by a Pizza Hut and I remembered being at the Eckville Shelter recently, frustrated because we were unable to have a pizza delivered there. I checked the map and saw that we were just a 20 minute drive from the shelter. Figuring there were probably some tired, hungry hikers there, we got a large pizza, large breadsticks, and two liter Mountain Dew and headed that way. We also had the remaining cookies given to me by our friend, Jana Leasure.Sure enough, there were several hikers sprawled out on the lawn as we pulled up. I recognized one of them, Tree, a hiker with whom I've shared a cabin and shelters. I got out of the car and, already knowing the answer asked, ""We got any hungry hikers here?"" In unison, they shouted, ""Yes!"" It was so cool to see the huge smiles on their faces and to be on the giving end of Trail Magic for a change. It was also neat for Janet to see a shelter and meet some of my fellow hikers. I started to take her over and let her flush the rare AT toilet, but then realized that may not be too impressive to her. We said our goodbyes to the hikers and headed back to the B&B for a final night of marital bliss.I guess this particular hiking blog was more about faith and family than hiking. I'm okay with that. I write what's on my heart. And besides, in the grand scheme of things, faith and family are a lot more important than hiking.Fob","Near Bake Oven Knob Shelter

PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543838,"""To be elated at success and disappointed at failure is to be the child of circumstances; how can such a one be called master of himself?"" - Chinese ProverbDay 112After our incredible time together, Janet drove me back to the trailhead near Slatington. It was tough and emotional to say goodbye again, but I told her I loved her and would think about her every day until I see her again in Maine. She told me she loved me and would pray for me every day. We then hugged and kissed and I headed out over the bridge.My sadness transitioned to bewilderment as I stared up at the climb out of Lehigh Gap that was ahead. The task was to climb 1000+ feet up the steep rockslide known as Blue Mountain, often going hand over hand. It was easily the most challenging rock scramble on the AT thus far, but it was also one of the most fun. I was glad the weather was clear, that I had long legs, and that my footing held on each precarious step.From 1898-1980 the zinc mining industry took a heavy environmental toll on Palmerton, Blue Mountain, and the surrounding area. The New Jersey Zinc Company, our nation's largest producer of zinc, left 33 million tons of slag (rocky waste) as a byproduct of their mining operations. The smelting operations also released heavy metals into the air and water, killing 2000 acres of vegetation on Blue Mountain and contaminating the Lehigh River and Aquashicola Creek. The Environmental Protection Agency added Palmerton to its National Priorities List in 1983 and since then there has been a concerted effort to grade and revegetate the land and clean the water and residences. As I climbed up and along Blue Mountain, I could tell it had taken a beating, but I was also impressed with the obvious effort underway to bring it back. Just to be on the safe side, I brought an extra bottle of Gatorade to avoid having to filter water from this area.After summiting Blue Mountain, I continued along its mostly flat ridge for a few miles. At mile 1262.1, Little Gap Road, two former thru-hikers, Flapjack and Tunes, were under a canopy giving out Trail Magic! I was surprised to see a hiker named Black Bear sitting there. I shared a shelter with him a couple of months ago and know that he routinely does 20+ mile days. I'm going at a much more leisurely pace so it made no sense for us both to be in the same location. It turns out he got a severe back infection and had to get off the trail, rest and heal for two weeks and was now back at it. I also met Scarecrow, Hot Toddy, and Terodactyle. After having a cheese sandwich, some fruit and topping off my water from their water jugs, I thanked them and hiked on.As I climbed out of Little Gap, a light rain began to fall. It made the rocks slippery but felt quite refreshing. I don't like setting up or breaking down camp in the rain, but don't mind hiking in it unless there is lightning.A little later I passed a monument to Monmouth Air Flight 98. On October 24, 1971 a Beechcraft 99 crashed at this location, killing both pilots and two of the six passengers. The accident report concluded the pilot executed a nonprecision instrument approach in instrument flight conditions. The report also stated the pilots' extensive on-duty time and resulting fatigue likely affected their judgement and decisions during the approach.Late in the afternoon, the rain stopped but it was still overcast and dark in the woods. I stopped and relieved myself on a tree and then sat down to take a break and drink some water. About 20 minutes after resuming my hike, I saw Black Bear heading towards me. He said, ""Fob, what are you doing?"" ""Hiking to Maine,"" I answered. ""Not in that direction,"" he replied. ""You're going southbound!"" I have read of hikers doing this before but never imagined doing it myself. Apparently during my last water break, I wasn't paying close enough attention and headed out the wrong way. In a dark section of forest that all looks pretty similar, I just never realized my mistake. I thanked him for helping me out and mentally wrote ""stupid"" on my forehead before turning northbound and continuing my journey.After this 40 minute mistake and a 10.2 mile day, I stealth camped near the intersection of the AT and the Delps Trail. I had only been away from my wife for six hours and was already missing her. I also thought about fatigue-induced errors and their consequences. My earlier error had cost me 40 minutes of time and unnecessarily hiking an extra 1.5 miles. The Monmouth Flight 98 pilots' error, near the same spot as mine and for the same basic reason, had cost them their lives.Fob","B&B, Kemper PA

I felt fatigued throughout the day and saw very few other hikers on the trail in either direction. At various points I felt like a zombie, mentally checked out and just mindlessly churning ahead like a sweaty robot stuck on autopilot. It was that rare day on the AT that was void of fun. Some days on the trail are just like that. A bright spot was some unattended Trail Magic at Wind Gap, featuring several bottles of water and a container full of dehydrated food.As I took off my socks that evening and stretched out in my tent on my air mattress, I noticed my first ever visible bruise on the bottom of my foot.

After helping them pitch the tent, I sat down and had a Coke and some chips. While I was visiting with them, Terodactyle arrived and sat down. He told me that he stayed at yesterday's Trail Magic stop for five hours drinking beer, and then headed up the hill on wet rocks after the rain. He slipped on a rock and fell, landing on his head. He sliced open the top of his head and blood started pouring out. He applied direct pressure and finally got the bleeding to stop. I took a look at it and gave him some Tribotic ointment to put on it. He'll have a nice scar but otherwise should be able to continue hiking. I guess the lesson to be learned is not to drink alcohol and hike, especially on slippery rocks.There were at least fifty day hikers on the trail today, out getting some exercise on the 4th of July weekend. Most were headed to or from the scenic Lookout Rock at mile 1291.5. Just north of Lookout Rock, I looked down and saw the strangest looking insect. From a distance it looked like it had huge eyes, but they are just part of its shell. Curious, I did some research and learned that the insect is an Eastern Eyed Click Beetle or Alaus Oculatus. God apparently designed this insect with large fake eyes as a defense mechanism to ward off potential enemies. In effect, it wears a mask to pretend to be something it's not. I guess we all do that from time to time.On the AT, I can't count how many times a passing hiker has said, ""How ya doin'?"" and I've donned the mask and said ""Fine,"" rather than more truthfully respond, ""Well, I have moderate chafing today because my shorts and underwear are drenched in sweat...my scalp itches because I haven't washed my hair in a week...I can't feel the bottoms of my feet...I miss my wife to the point of crying...and 15 minutes ago I smashed a sweat bee on the side of my head and I believe its remains are lodged in my ear. Thanks for asking!""I'm afraid too often ""How ya doin'?"" is just a greeting, something to say, without really the slightest interest in how the other person is doing. ""Fine"" is just something to say back and is hardly indicative of how the fellow hiker is actually doing or feeling. I'm afraid back in the real world I'm also guilty of this, both as the insincere questioner and less than truthful responder. Too often I'm nothing but an Eyed Click Beetle, wearing a mask and pretending to be something that I'm not.So I'm going to work on that. I'd like to be more like my friend Jeff H. from Florida who is much more transparent about what he is facing in life as a husband, father, church deacon, etc. He's less concerned with image and more concerned with genuinely telling it like it is. My new approach: After asking someone ""How ya doin'?"" and them answering ""Fine"" I'm going to look them in the eye and say, ""Now tell me how you're really doing?"" I'm going to slow down life's pace a tad and try to sincerely listen more and care more. I hope my family and closest friends will hold me accountable.After 9.3 miles I arrived at the beautiful town of Delaware Water Gap. This town easily places in my Top 5 trail towns so far. For starters, the AT runs right through town so there's no hitching or long side hikes required. Next, throw in the Church of the Mountain Hiker Center, a church hostel which offers free bunks (donations accepted), a shower, hiker lounge, lemonade, hiker box, etc. As I walked up its driveway, a friendly church couple exiting in their car rolled down the window and said, ""Welcome! Make yourself at home in our hostel! There's a gentleman up there who will shuttle you to Walmart or a grocery store or laundromat if you need that. And there's a 4th of July concert on the lawn tonight...hope you can make it!"" I thought they would just say, ""How ya doin'?"" to which I was prepared to say, ""Fine"".After claiming a bunk, showering, and weighing myself (188, down 46.6 lbs), I walked down the street to Edge of the Woods Outfitter for a new pair of hiking socks, backup trekking pole tips, and electrolytes. My next stop was the Village Farmer and Bakery where they offer, among many things, a hot dog and slice of pie for $2.95. While tempted to get three of those, I instead went with the barbecue brisket with mac n cheese and baked beans. That would be quite filling for a normal human. I am currently an abnormal human so I went next door to the Water Gap Diner for coffee and apple pie a la mode. As I turned around to speak to Foxfire, my 67 year old hiking friend, I spilled my hot coffee on my lap and dropped the cup on the floor. It was embarrassing and made my hiking shorts and underwear smell like Folgers for the next five days.That night, my love affair with Delaware Water Gap continued as I dragged a lawn chair over to the pavilion and joined mostly older folks in listening to a local band put on a patriotic July 4th concert. At intermission I had two hot dogs, chips, a brownie, and lemonade. Towards the end of the concert they played a military medley. When the Air Force song was played, I stood (alone) and sang out like a proud Airmen. I got a few strange looks and a few laughs. That's what happens when you take your mask off, show genuine emotion, and choose to be more then just an Eyed Clicked Beetle.Fob","Stealth Camp, 10 miles from PA border

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544281,"""Life is raw material. We are artisans. We can sculpt our existence into something beautiful, or debase it into ugliness. It's in our hands."" - Cathy BetterDay 115After a pancake breakfast at the Water Gap Diner, I said farewell to Delaware Water Gap and crossed a long bridge over the Delaware River as traffic zoomed by. Halfway across the bridge I saw a painted sign on the walkway marking my departure from Pennsylvania and entrance into New Jersey. It felt good to check off another state and be back in the state from which I graduated from high school. I have fond memories from my years at Northern Burlington High School and truly appreciate the high school friends who are following my journey and offering their encouragement. It was also kind of interesting to be returning to New Jersey at the same weight as when I left.Just over the bridge I stopped at the Kittatinny Visitor Center to top off my tank from their water fountain and purchase a Gatorade for later. As I walked around looking at their displays and talking to the Park Rangers, I was sort of dreading going back out into the heat and humidity. Just then a wheelchair-bound man came in with a friend to re-charge his wheelchair battery behind a bench. It was a quick and necessary reminder that some folks would give anything to be able to stand and hike even a few feet, so I should appreciate the ability and opportunity I have to hike this magnificent trail.My first real task of the day was a five mile, 1100 foot climb with a few dozen mostly day hikers up to Sunfish Pond. This section of trail, up to the Kittatinny Mountain summit, will likely find a home in my Top 10 sections of the AT, and the glacial pond was easily the prettiest to date. Sunfish Pond is a 44-acre glacial lake and a U.S. National Natural Landmark. Just standing there on its banks felt very special. The AT in New Jersey was off to an impressive start!After descending the mountain, I stopped at the Mohican Outdoor Center for a Reuben sandwich, chips, Coke, and rest. I talked to Arrow and Mountain Goat, my piano playing Aussie friend. Mountain Goat was preparing to spend a week in New York City to allow an earlier hiking companion to catch up with her. As I ate my Reuben, she emerged from the restroom and in her adorable Aussie voice said, ""Fob, I'm kind of weak and have the worst diarrhea...do you think it's Giardia?"" I had no clue how to respond, but wanted to continue the conversation about her diarrhea because I love her accent. I told her to rest, drink fluids, see an NYC doc if the trots continue, and try not to have an accident in Times Square.At mile 1305.9 I passed the Catfish Lookout Tower and spoke to a group of teens and Foxfire, who was tenting there for the night. I continued on despite an approaching storm. About out of water, I stopped at a pond which is described in my guidebooks as a ""swamp"" and beaver pond. The water was unusually warm and I just hoped that my water filter would filter out the bad stuff. After a 14.9 mile day, I stealth camped at mile 1307.9. Thirty minutes after crawling into my tent, the rain started to fall and would continue throughout the night.Fob","Delaware Water Gap

It was another hot and humid day. The New Jersey gnats, black flies, horse flies, and sweat bees formed a federation and aggressively swarmed my head. I once again had to don my head net for much of the day, which frustrates them to no end.At mile 1321.4 I descended into Culvers Gap near Branchfield, NJ. The guidebook map showed three eating establishments just off the trail. The first, Sunrise AT Diner, was closed. The second, Stokes Steakhouse, had gone out of business and is up for sale. Facing my final strike, I nervously approached Gyp's Tavern and it was open! The first thing I noticed inside was a t-shirt on the wall featuring a deer squatting on a plant and the title...""Hey Vegetarians... My Food Poops on Your Food."" I laughed harder and longer than the joke warranted. Inspired, I ate a pizza, hot dog, and onion rings while talking to fellow hikers Scott, Jersey, and Boston.I hiked a few more miles to the Gren Anderson Shelter, and called it a day after 16.5 miles. It was a beautiful night with no rain in the forecast so, for the first time, I tented without a rain fly. It was neat to feel a slight breeze in the tent and be able to look up and see the stars above.Fob","Stealth Camp, Mile 1307.9

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544501,"Day 117In case you're wondering, the rocks don't end at the Pennsylvania border. They continue into New Jersey for awhile, and that included my hike on Day 117. The motivational goal today was reaching High Point State Park, the summit of which is the highest point in New Jersey. Even more important to me was the existence of a concession stand at the park's popular beach and swimming area.Based on a tip from a southbounder, I visited High Point SP headquarters, where signing their hiker logbook earns you a free Coke. Nice touch, Jersey. I then hiked over to the beach and swimming area and located the concession stand. The prices were high, but I was extremely hungry and in desperate need of calories. Over the next hour, while drying out my clothes and gear, I ate an ice cream appetizer, cheeseburger, hot dog, French fries, two Gatorades, two Cokes, and another ice cream. The total came to $400. I then hopped in the bathroom shower to rinse off the salt formations that had formed on my beard, earlobes, and elsewhere. If I were rich and it were allowed, I would have spent the rest of my summer at this park, eating, swimming, and showering.After an 18.4 mile day, I reached the Murray property, also known as the Secret Shelter. For the past nearly twenty years, Mr. Murray, an AT thru-hiker, has graciously let hikers camp on his beautiful grassy farm. It's not an official shelter, but has a cabin, tenting area, privy, outdoor shower, and well water. After setting up my tent in the soft grass and visiting with several other hikers, two donkeys came up. At first I thought I was hallucinating from the heat. My mind was racing with questions. Are there wild donkeys? Does Mr. Murray own these? Can you eat them? If so, how would you go about killing them? Are they friendly? Will they make waffles in the morning? Does Mountain Goat have Giardia?They turned out to be very friendly. In fact, while I ate dinner on the porch, one came over and put his head on my shoulder and then began scratching his neck against my shoulder. This was the most affection I'd experienced since the bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. I captured the bizarre moment on video. I also realized that the AT had basically reduced me to nothing more than a fence post.Fob","Near Gren Anderson Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544636,"""Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears."" - Marcus AureliusDay 118I crawled out of my tent and the donkeys were gone. My guess is that some of the other hikers butchered and ate them. I broke camp and headed north. Two miles into the hike I took a side trail .7 miles west to the town of Unionville. I've read and heard that New York and New Jersey have periodic AT road crossings with delis nearby and that the sandwiches are wonderful. I went to the End of the Line Grocery to find out for myself. I threw down a delicious egg, ham, and cheese sandwich along with coffee, orange juice, and chocolate milk. I also did some basic re-supply of food. Out on the front porch I met Big Al who lives in an apartment with his wife above the store. He asked lots of questions about my journey and told me that he and his wife were about to move ""up north"" to start a farm. He was super friendly and I hope his new farming venture works out for them.At mile 1347.3 the trail turns east for a flat, open, 1.2 mile walk along the Wallkill Reserve. I appreciated the flat part, but hiking 1.2 miles in direct sunlight in the middle of summer with a 30+ pound backpack felt like about three miles. Thankfully, the trail turns back into the shade of the woods. Just a few minutes later, I stopped with a hiker named Journeyman for some Trail Magic! Some good soul left a cooler of cold sodas, jugs of water, and several cartons of raspberries.Later in the day I enjoyed the nearly mile long walk on a boardwalk over a massive swamp. Although I was once again exposed to direct sunlight, sometimes it's nice to get a break from the long green tunnel.Late in the afternoon I made the somewhat challenging climb up the ""stairway to heaven"" to the summit of Wawayanda Mountain. At mile 1358.1 I looked up and 15 yards ahead was a large black bear foraging for berries along the trail! It was the largest black bear I've ever seen in the wild. Although New Jersey has the highest population of black bears per square mile of any state, it is always surprising, unexpected, and tense when you encounter one. I stopped, reached for my phone, and took two steps backward to position myself behind a tree. On the second step, the bear looked up, saw me, and took off into the woods at full speed. It was obvious that Fob was the new mayor of Wayawanda Mountain.I went another .4 miles and, after a 15.8 mile day, found a nice stealth camping spot by a footbridge and stream. I dipped my sweaty clothes, and then self, into a pool in the stream. After eating supper I went to hang my bear bag which seemed like a smart move given my recent encounter. Hanging a bear bag involves putting a rock in a small duffel bag and attaching a fifty foot piece of parachute cord to it by a carabiner. You then throw the rock-filled bag over a branch at least twelve to fifteen feet in the air and about six feet from the trunk. The branch needs to be big enough to support the weight of your food but not big enough for a bear to crawl out on. Using the branch as a pulley, you replace the rock back with your food bag and pull on the loose end of the rope to suspend your bag in the air by the branch.I've gotten pretty good at hanging bags but tonight was a big fail. For the first time on my journey, the rock bag didn't clear the branch and got stuck in it. I mean really stuck. It was almost dark, I had just seen a bear, and I was holding an eight pound bag of food. This was not good...not good at all. I tugged and tugged at different angles but the bag remain lodged. I decided to give one final tug with both hands and all the strength I could muster. As I yanked on it, I heard a snap and the rock bag came flying at me at warp speed! Before I could even say Wayawanda, the rock struck me violently in the stomach. It hurt so bad that I went to one knee, certain it had done some damage. Fortunately it struck the softest, fleshiest part of my body (with my buttocks a close second), and would just leave a painful bruise for several days. Had it struck above my neck or below my waist, it could have been lights out for my thru-hike attempt.Tired and bruised, I crawled into my tent. Before dozing off, I called my wife to check on her. I told her I had survived my encounter with a New Jersey bear, but was less successful in my encounter with a bear bag.Fob","Secret Shelter

At mile 1365.4 I crossed a rocky ridge and took a break at the sign showing the border between New Jersey and New York. I posed for a sexy shirtless photo because I knew Janet not only wanted that, but needed that.The trail in southern New York is very challenging, despite the modest looking elevation profile in the guidebook. The rocks, endless ups and downs, and hot humid weather made the first few days in New York some of the toughest hiking since Virginia. Just after crossing the border I climbed over Prospect Rock, the highest point in New York. Atop the rock someone had raised an American flag and I stopped to salute it. Despite all of our nation's problems, this is still a great country, founded on freedom and God-given inalienable rights. I am still proud to be an American.Just north of Greenwood Lake, the AT passes near a hot dog stand and Bellvale Farms, reportedly some of the best ice cream in the state. With storm clouds approaching, I went to Hot Dog Plus and ordered the hiker special, two long hot dogs, chips and a soda. It was so good I ordered a second one. As I started into the second plate, heavy rain started to pour. I was sitting under one of those vinyl umbrellas which kept my food and head mostly dry. However, rain hit my neck and back, drenching the back half of me. The owner wisely closed the stand and departed. So there I was...alone, in a downpour, getting drenched, and eating four delicious New York hot dogs. These are the less than glamorous moments that don't always surface on Instagram. These are also the moments that I'm glad Janet is not out here with me, as she would be miserable and I would hate to see that. Still, it was a scene I will always remember.With a momentary break in the rain, I walked just up the hill to Bellvale Farms for some ice cream. Several hikers were huddled inside, including Torch, Sunshine, and Moxie. As heavy rain began falling again, I ate a large cookie dough ice cream and talked to young Torch some more about a military career. I asked the lady at the counter if I could charge my phone and she said there was a hiker charging station outside, seemingly oblivious to the fact there was a torrential downpour underway outside. While waiting for the rain to stop, I had second dessert, a large chocolate milkshake. I may have looked like a wet, homeless Amish man, but for the first time in awhile, I was a full one.Once the rain stopped I hiked north two more miles and tented near Wildcat Shelter, completing a 14.9 mile day. I was glad to see Torch, Wheels, Waterfall, and onesie-wearing Treebeard all staying in or near the shelter. Despite more rain in the forecast, I hung up my wet clothes, hoping to replace some of the sweat with water. It had been an interesting day, and it was good to feel safe, dry, and warm inside my tent.Fob","Stealth Camp, Mile 1358.5

PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544772,"""It is difficulties that show what men are."" - EpictetusDay 120I awoke at 6:00 a.m. to the sound of rain, so I rolled over and slept some more and then listened to an iBook entitled Kingdom Man by Tony Evans. After the rain stopped I headed north on a wet, puddle-filled AT. Near mile 1378.3 I passed the Long Distance Trails Crew on a break and gave them a fist pump and my thanks for their important work on the trail. Later, near West Mombasha Road and again at the Orange Turnpike, sweet souls had left jugs of water for hikers they may never meet.While descending Arden Mountain, I slipped and fell on my behind. After not falling for about the first 800 miles on the AT, I've fallen about eight times since. No harm was done other than some dirt on my shorts and pack. At NY 17, I caught up with Foxfire, who was enjoying some water and apples, our third trail magic of the day. Is that too much? Absolutely not, especially when you're talking about water... in mid-summer...on a stretch with notoriously unreliable water sources. Good job, New Yorkers!Late in the day, I arrived at the Arden Valley Road parking area and saw a tent set up. Yes, it was full-up Trail Magic, the fourth of the day, courtesy of Uncle Rog. Uncle Rog asked if I wanted a burger, sausage, or both. I'll bet you already know my answer. He also had a tub full of all types of snacks and a cooler full of drinks. He previously thru-hiked the AT and, like so many others, does trail magic to give back and stay connected to the AT community. After filling my stomach, emptying my trash, and grabbing a few snacks, I thanked him and hiked on.A short while later I entered Harriman State Park which is jaw-droppingly gorgeous and will easily make my final Top 10 AT sections list. There are several things that set it apart. First, the forest is less dense than elsewhere on the trail, allowing sunlight beams to shine through and cast beautiful shadows. Next, it has long, vibrant green grass that makes you want to plop down on it and take a nap. Third, throw in scenic lakes and large boulders spread throughout the park. Finally, the trail itself is not overly rocky or strenuous, which allows a hiker to glance up more often to enjoy the views.At mile 1385.1, after a rain-shortened 11.7 mile day, I pitched my tent in a terrific spot overlooking Island Pond. After setting up camp and having supper, I took a good close look at my trail shoes. They had served me well for hundreds of miles, but it was time to say goodbye. I set them in the fire ring, put a match to them, and sang Ring of Fire as they quickly went up in flames. (Yes, I know that is bad for the environment. So are the fumes produced in my tent each night.) With the fire still burning, I pulled out my new Salomon XA Pro 3Ds, a full size larger because the trail has swelled and flattened out my feet. Strangely, it was a bit of a morale boost being in this beautiful spot and knowing I would start tomorrow on fresh new treads.Fob","Near Wildcat Shelter

Actually, it wasn't a tough challenge for my feet but did, for the first time, require me to remove my backpack and carry it over my head to get through it.I set my sights on Lake Tiorati Beach which, according to my guidebook, would offer free showers, restrooms, vending machines, and swimming. At mile 1388.8 I took a side trail and arrived at the beach. Dozens of families were lined up grilling and having picnics, although there would be no magical offers of a burger for the passing Sir Fob. Job 1 was to hang up my wet tent to let it dry in the sun. I then showered, hand-washed a few of the nastier clothes, re-charged my phone, and consumed three ice creams and two sodas from the vending machine. The only downside to the pretty beach and picnic area was the incredibly loud noise caused by the large groups of motorcyclists who came storming by every ten minutes. After a nice two hour break, I headed back up to the trail and continued hiking.Later in the day, at mile 1395.4, I made the mistake of not stopping to get water at a brook. I still had a little under a liter and figured there would be more ahead. That was dumb, because when it comes to water on the AT, you don't assume or hope...you check and calculate. While climbing West Mountain, considered the toughest climb in New York, I stopped and talked to three southbound day hikers. They were Jewish and asked if I was also Jewish on account of my beard. Little did they realize this was a huge compliment for a guy whose goal of growing a respectable, visible beard ranks just below summiting Katahdin.My climb up West Mountain was rewarded with a great view of the Hudson River in the valley below and the New York City skyline far off on the horizon. I needed water but noticed that it was a .6 mile blue blazed trail to the shelter and even further to water. Altogether that would be about 1.6 non-AT miles round trip and I wasn't feeling that so I hiked on. My next opportunity for water was vending machine bottled water at the top of Bear Mountain, about 4 miles away. It was 6:30 p.m., I was tired, almost out of water, and now had to descend and then climb a mountain to buy water and find a place to camp before dark. Doable, but not ideal, it was the kind of stress I like to avoid whenever possible.I made the climb up the widely popular Bear Mountain and spent $10 on PowerAde and bottled water at the vending machine. I instantly chugged two of the bottles, as the sun started to set. There was a beautiful view from the summit and a deer stood nearby watching me breathe heavily, drink, and belch. I'm sure she also was impressed with my new trail shoes. I quickly found a stealth camping spot near the summit, set up my tent, and hung my bear bag.My new trail shoes had survived their first 15.3 mile day on the AT and three Jews had complimented me on my beard. What more can you ask for? Well...As I prepared to enter my tent, a couple of Hispanic teenagers at the rocky lookout above me shouted something in Spanish (something about Vamos a destruir Fob) and began shooting off fireworks. Great stuff, amigos! In fact, I hadn't seen fireworks like that since my time at the bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania.Fob","Island Pond, Harriman State Park

When necessary, use words."" - St. Francis of Assisi""Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible."" - St. Francis of AssisiDay 122As far as I could tell, I was the only person on Bear Mountain last night. They close the road and there didn't appear to be any other hikers. During my descent, I walked by more litter than I had seen on my entire journey. Apparently the mountain is a popular getaway for people from New York City and elsewhere, and more than a few of them just toss their trash along the trail. At the base of the mountain I walked by an otherwise beautiful park with lots of litter, next to scenic Hessian Lake. There was a tiny little island on the lake just a few yards from the shore and even it had litter on it. Come on, people!Since the Trailside Museum and Zoo weren't open yet and I needed to re-supply, I decided to hike over to Fort Montgomery. This is when things started to get interesting. I came to a large, busy traffic circle and walked by an accident scene. The police were there interviewing one driver, while the other driver, an elderly man, leaned against his car in obvious distress. I went over and started talking to him. He said the woman cut into his lane and hit him and he was on his way to a doctor's appointment. Exasperated and with no phone, he said, ""What am I gonna do?"" I told him everything would be okay, the police were there, no one was injured, the car could be repaired, and the doctor would reschedule his appointment. He declined my offer to use my phone to call the doctor. We then started talking about my hike and the story behind my trail name. By the time I left, he at least had a smile on his face to go along with his damaged Buick. I guess he figured as bad as his day was going, at least his children don't poop on the trail.The normal bridge and passenger walkway to Fort Montgomery were under construction and closed, but I was told there was a footpath through the woods and over a footbridge to the town. I headed down the footpath near the Hudson River and came to a fork in the trail. The main path seemed to break left but the right fork would take me toward the water and what appeared to be a bridge over it. I chose the right path which would turn out to be the wrong one. The path became increasingly rough and rocky, and then I came to a ""No Trespassing"" sign. There's your sign, Fob! Undeterred by this warning, and feeling unusually stupid, I kept going, certain there was a footbridge ahead that would take me over the water and into town.When I finally got to the water, I discovered that what I thought was a footbridge was actually a railroad bridge. I was on private railroad property which explained the No Trespassing sign. Determined to see how many dumb decisions I could make in a row, I decided to cross over the railroad bridge rather than turn around and backtrack. It was just wide enough to fit me and a train, I figured. If not, I could always jump off the bridge into the water, like the scene in the movie Stand By Me. With my ears listening for a train, I kicked it into high gear and sped along for a few hundred yards across the bridge. My next Fobstacle was a railroad tunnel going under the mountain for a couple hundred yards. It was wide enough for me and a train, but was pitch black. I donned my headlamp and headed into the tunnel, knowing Janet would disapprove. It was super creepy in the tunnel, the kind of place where Injun Joe might go to murder Widow Douglas. I didn't see any rats in the long dark corridor but I'm certain they were there and saw me. I finally cleared the tunnel, breathed a sigh of relief, and then hiked another mile or so uphill into Fort Montgomery.After resupplying and having a few snacks at a convenience store, I decided to tour historic Fort Montgomery along the banks of the Hudson River. Back during the Revolutionary War, both sides understood the strategic importance of controlling the Hudson River. It was the major means of transporting troops and supplies throughout much of the northeast. The Continental Congress directed that fortifications be built along the Hudson to maintain control of navigation on the river. (Pay attention...this will be on the final.) I walked by the location where the good guys placed a river battery of six 32-pound cannons, pointed toward the Hudson River. Unfortunately, on October 6, 1777, a combined force of about 2,100 British regulars, Loyalists, and Hessians attacked the fort and neighboring Fort Clinton from the land side. By the end of the day the British defeated the grossly outnumbered colonialists, burned the forts, and tore down the stonework buildings. This was a Pyrrhic victory for the British, though, as the campaign delayed their arrival to Saratoga, where the Americans won a big victory. Class dismissed.I exited the historical park and found the correct path and pedestrian footbridge over the water. Next on the agenda was to visit the Trailside Museum and Zoo. The zoo only houses permanently injured or orphaned animals that would be unable to survive in the wild. They also must be native to New York State. I think this is a good thing, although when I walked by the injured Bald Eagle, I wondered about his quality of life sitting on that perch 24/7/365. I wondered if he had ever known the joy of soaring over a mountain or swooping down and catching a field mouse (and bopping it on its head). Would it be better to have those memories to think back on or to have been injured and rescued early in life so you don't know what you're missing? Or do bald eagles even have memories like that? I don't know.I made my way over to the bear exhibit which is the lowest point on the entire AT. The bear was laying in a hammock taking a rest, surrounded by fifty or so vultures. It was truly a weird scene, like when you walk in on your parents kissing. He just laid there watching the tourists and we just stood there watching him. The vultures were still and silent, as if posing for an Addams family Christmas card photo. I felt uncomfortable and would have to agree that it was the lowest point on the AT.With my re-supply, historic tour, and zoo trip complete, I got back on the trail and crossed over the majestic Hudson River. I climbed 700 feet and then descended to the intersection of US 9 and NY 403. I stopped at the Appalachian Market, conveniently located by the AT, and consumed a double cheeseburger, onion rings, slice of pizza, milkshake, Coke, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade.""For it is in giving that we receive...It is in pardoning that we are pardoned."" - St. Francis of AssisiLess than a mile later, at mile 1409.6, I arrived at the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center, a monastery that allows hikers to camp at their softball field pavilion. Known formally as the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement, they have been called, in the words of Saint Francis of Assisi, ""to heal wounds, to unite what has fallen apart, and to bring home those who have lost their way."" In the summer of 1972 the first AT hiker stumbled upon Graymoor and asked to spend the night. Since then the Friars have graciously welcomed hikers to stay on their grounds, seek shelter under the pavilion, access their well water, and use their port-a-pot. Each day a Friar comes by the field to check for sick or injured hikers. I think Saint Francis would be happy about that. It's a special place with a special vibe, and I can see why people with addictions come here to walk the grounds and find healing and peace. At the top of every hour, the beautiful sound of church bells played over the loud speaker.Normally at a campground or shelter in early evening, hikers would be sitting around talking and laughing and sharing stories from the day. At Graymoor, the fifteen or so of us hikers were spread out along picnic tables and across the field journaling, thinking, and meditating alone. At least one of them was praying, thanking God for a special campsite on an amazing trail in a wonderful country. It had been an interesting day, featuring an accident scene, the scary crossing of a railroad bridge and tunnel, a historic battlefield, and a bear surrounded by vultures. As I lay in my tent, I thought about the elderly man at the accident scene and hoped that he was safe at home and at peace. I wasn't at home, but I felt safe at Graymoor and very much at peace.Fob","Bear Mountain

It was a warm day and the trail was like a kiddie roller coaster with short ups and downs. I set my sights on Clarence Fahnestock State Park. Just after World War 1, an influenza epidemic hit the United States. While treating patients with the disease, Dr. Fahnestock became sick himself and died. His brother Ernest later donated the property to the government as a memorial to Clarence, and they turned it into a 14,337 acre state park and recreation area.I arrived at NY 301 at 3:10 p.m. and saw a sign posted on a tree that there was a snack bar at the park, that it was two miles away, and that it closed at 4:00 p.m. I took off down the trail like Forrest Gump when he was being chased by the bullies. I went about as fast as I could go given the terrain and weather and my fifty-year-old feet. When you live off of crackers, granola bars, and tortillas, the very thought of a concession stand burger can make you salivate and hike like a mad man. At 3:52 I arrived at the edge of the lake in a full sweat. I ran up the sidewalk by the beach, dropped my pack, and stormed into the snack bar at 3:58 p.m. ""Can I still get a burger?"" I asked, huffing and puffing. ""Sure,"" the young lady at the counter replied. ""We don't close until 5:00."" I was elated they were still open. I was also frustrated that I had unnecessarily gone into sprint mode for nearly an hour. I stayed there 90 minutes, drying out while eating a bacon cheeseburger, ice cream, and Gatorade.I traveled another five miles and ended my 18.8 mile day at the RPH Shelter. I arrived too late to order pizza, but once again earlier arriving hikers had plenty of leftovers and offered me some.

That trend continued today when I arrived at NY 52 and travelled .4 miles east to enjoy two slices of pizza. While sitting there eating and surfing the Internet, I came across an article that would serve as my inspiration today.Thirty-three year old Drew Houston founded Dropbox, the file-sharing and storage service, at age twenty-four. He was a billionaire by the age of thirty-one. While giving a commencement speech in 2013 at MIT, his alma mater, he said if he could give a cheat sheet to his twenty-two year old self, it would have three things on it: ""a tennis ball, a circle, and the number 30,000."" The tennis ball is about finding the thing you're infatuated with. His dog gets obsessed and goes wild when you pull out a tennis ball and the most successful people he knows are obsessed with solving a problem that really matters to them. The circle represents the idea that you are the average of your five closest friends, so be sure to surround yourself with people that bring out your best. Finally, 30,000 represents the number of days the average person lives. So you have to make each of those days count.I left the pizza place full, motivated, and with 3 liters of water, because water sources in New York are infrequent and unreliable. My afternoon hike featured a snake sighting, a deer sighting, and a stroll around the north end of beautiful Nuclear Lake. In 1958 the federal government set up a secret experimental nuclear fuel research lab along the shore of this lake. The site was fenced in and guarded and the experiments involved uranium and other radioactive materials. In the early 1970s two serious accidents occurred at the site, both resulting in the release of radioactive material. Although the site has since been given a clean bill of health, I opted not to get water there or fish for a 3-headed trout.One of the most interesting parts of hiking the AT to me is not knowing how a day will end. What will the weather do? Will there be a flat spot to set up my tent? Will there be a water source? Will I see anybody I know? You see a day playing out a certain way and then all of a sudden something very different transpires. It is really important to be flexible, keep a sense of humor, and go with the flow.I envisioned arriving at the Telephone Pioneers Shelter, getting water, and tenting there. When I arrived late in the day, I discovered there were no good, level tenting spots and the nearby stream was completely dry. Apparently this spot wasn't meant to be. Little Rhino and Loligag from Arkansas were there and kindly offered me some of their water but I declined. Their water is for them and I was not yet in an emergency situation. My guidebook said if the stream is dry, hike .7 more miles and get water from a purple house just east of the trail on West Dover Road.I arrived at the purple house and saw that a hiker named Rasputin was already there getting water from a spigot on the side of the house. The house was vacant and it was starting to get dark. We would hike on a footbridge, across a swamp, and then along a long boardwalk if we continued further north. So, we decided to go to the far side of the house, not visible by the neighbors, and camp there in the yard. Technically, we were trespassing as the only thing expressly allowed is access to the spigot. I was willing to take the chance of being cited for trespassing in order to have a nice, flat grassy tenting spot near a water spigot. In fact, as it got dark, I went back and used the warm water spigot (there were two) to give myself an Allan from Colorado-style full-body sponge bath.Day 124 (one of about 30,000 in my life, if I'm lucky) didn't turn out like I had planned, but it turned out just fine. Tomorrow would be a new day and I looked forward to what was in store. Why? Because right now hiking the AT is my passion...my tennis ball...and I know I will need a lot of that to make it to the end.Fob","Near RPH Shelter

As I crossed the street to get back on the trail, I walked by Dover Oak, the largest oak tree on the entire AT. I believe I am the largest Fob.A short time later, I crossed a series of footbridges and boardwalks over creeks and swamps. I decided to listen to some tunes on my phone, and the first song that came on was Imagine by John Lennon. It's a classic song about mankind living in peace and harmony, but Mr. Lennon takes us to such an idyllic place by removing heaven and religion from the equation. As I hiked, I thought about how the lyrics might have been different had Lennon been a Christian and held a Christian worldview. We'll never know as he was against religious teaching and organized religion, and according to his song God, didn't believe in Jesus or the Bible. Well, I happen to believe in God, Jesus, and the Bible, so I thought I would rewrite the song from a Christian perspective...Re-ImagineBy Sir Fob W.

I briefly considered a day trip into New York City, but decided I'd rather wait and do that in clean clothes with my wife. I did stop at the hiker-friendly Native Landscapes and Garden Center for an apple, two sodas, and two Klondike bars. The lady at the cash register was very friendly and interested in my hike. She probably sees ten to twenty hikers each day and yet made me feel like I was the only hiker on the trail. That's a gift.Around lunchtime I stopped at Wiley Shelter and visited with Loligag and Little Rhino, the pride of Little Rock, Arkansas. They offered me a cookie and I accepted, because one must accept all food offers while hiking the trail. About a mile later, I crossed the border into Connecticut!At 4:00 p.m. I arrived at a beautiful campsite on Ten Mile River.

The original Bulls Bridge was built across the Housatonic River by Jacob and Isaac Bull in 1760. Legend has it that George Washington crossed the bridge while it was under construction. The current bridge, one of three surviving covered bridges in Connecticut, was built in 1842 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Legend has it that in 2016 Sir Fob W. Pot crossed the bridge before and after consuming a muffin, banana, Gatorade, and cup of coffee.At mile 1466.7 I considered going into Kent but decided not to. Two different hikers told me it's not a hiker friendly town. One hiker said the laundromat isn't hiker friendly. I can't imagine what they would have against hiker laundry. Another hiker said hello to some people downtown and they replied, ""just keep on hiking."" While it's not fair to write-off a town on the basis of two reports, it was enough for me to push on to the next town.Late in the day I descended the St. John Ledges, steep stone steps leading down to the Housatonic River. I then began a long, flat walk along the river. It was pretty but I had dozens of gnats swarming my head and sweaty body, by far the worst attack of my journey. I declared war on them. I put my trekking poles up and pulled out my DEET. I sprayed them with my left hand while hitting myself in the face and side of the head with my right hand. As I flailed around swinging wildly, I suspect I looked like the Gerasene demoniac Jesus encountered in Luke 8. The gnats and black flies fell from the air in masses, as more smashed casualties piled up on the sides of my face. My right hand was covered in bug splats, even as more gnat reinforcements arrived. It was an epic battle with no clear winner.After a 15.6 mile day, I tented along the river near Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter. I was joined by Loligag, Little Rhino, and Count, who got that trail name by carrying and reading the large Count of Monte Cristo novel early in his hike. Later, I was happy to see Brits Sam Squanch and Boss come into camp. I asked how their two days in New York City went.

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546092,"""I still need more healthy rest in order to work at my best. My health is the main capital I have and I want to administer it intelligently."" - Ernest HemingwayDay 127I woke up today and realized I needed a break. It had been 17 days since my last zero or near-0 and a recharge was overdue. I've previously blogged about Stephen Covey's Habit 2, Begin with the End in Mind, and how that principle is useful on the AT. Day 127 was all about Habit 7, Sharpen the Saw. According to Covey, sharpening the saw is about preserving and enhancing the greatest asset you have--you. It is critically important to renew yourself physically, socially/emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Doing so allows you to stay fresh, have energy, and take on the challenges that life deals you. If you fail to sharpen the saw, according to Covey, your body becomes weak, your mind mechanical, your emotions raw, your spirit insensitive, and your person selfish. That's a bad position to be in, especially out on a long distance hike.Here's how I've gone about sharpening the saw on the AT:- Physically - taking zeros and near-0s and staying off my feet. Getting a massage in Birmingham while in town for my son's wedding. Soaking in a hot tub in Hot Springs. Enjoying various hot, Epsom salt, essential oil baths at friends' homes and hotels. Especially during the first two months, taking breaks during the day and soaking my feet in a cold mountain stream. The AT pounds you physically, all day long, for five to seven months. You simply must create opportunities to rest and rejuvenate your body.- Socially/Emotionally. I have been renewed socially many times simply by good conversation around a campfire, in a shelter, or on a lunch break. When you hear five different and funny stories about people falling in the mud, you start to view it as something funny, not a hiking disaster. I have been encouraged, strengthened and renewed by some amazing people out here. I have also been emotionally renewed from phone calls and texts with my family, and wonderful comments on my personal and Trail Journals blogs. Emotionally, I've tried to just let my emotions run wild. I've cried thinking about my mom. I've gotten angry at rocks (which does a lot of good!). I've laughed with people, at people, and about people. Letting these emotions run their course sort of resets me.- Mentally. I try to keep my mind sharp by thinking about all sorts of things. Sometimes I'll calculate my average miles per hour, or number of days until the end at different daily mileage averages, or the number of bugs I can kill per hour, or how long to a shelter going 1.75 or 2.25 miles per hour. Sometimes I write songs or blogs in my head or analyze the lyrics to songs. I've tried to remember the names of all my past teachers, all the tight ends the Dallas Cowboys have ever had, my Top 10 favorite songs and movies and places, and other useless information.- Spiritually. For me, the AT has been a highly spiritual environment, even more so than I anticipated. God's creative power and awesomeness is so overwhelmingly evident all day long. How anyone could hike the AT and end up an atheist is beyond me. For 127 straight days I have said at least one long prayer every day and usually several each day. Sadly, that's not something I did nearly as well in my pre-AT life. I think my prayers have been more conversational and less formulaic. I've also been renewed by attending worship services whenever possible, participating in an online Bible study, and listening to inspirational iBooks. Although I will return to the real world a flawed, sinful man, I think this experience has made me a stronger Christian.So it was time for some renewal. I made an easy 4.1 mile hike to CT 4 and then hiked .9 miles east to the town of Cornwall Bridge. It was a nice little town in which to sharpen the saw. I stayed and did laundry at the Hitching Post Motel. I ate three massive meals at the Cornwall Country Market while talking to the locals. I also visited Housatonic River Outfitters/Bookstore and bought a bottle of Permethrin to spray my clothes with.My time in Cornwall Bridge was certainly rejuvenating for my body, mind, soul, and spirit. My saw was sharpened and I looked forward to a good night of sleep in a bed before hiking on.Fob","Near Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter

The weather was nice and I felt really good. That's what hiking with a sharpened saw does for a person.After 14 miles of hiking I arrived at the quaint town of Falls Village, founded in 1840. Falls Village, the second smallest town in Connecticut, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It's the kind of place you'd go to get away from it all and write a book.My guidebook said that tenting was possible behind the hiker-friendly Toymaker Cafe, so I headed that way. Greg and Ann Bidou run the cafe, which was unfortunately closed for the day when I arrived. However, Greg kindly offered to fill my water bottles and showed me where I could tent behind the cafe. Greg's side business, T100 Toymakers, imports parts for vintage British motorcycles. A red barn behind the cafe is filled with frames and matching motors for old Triumphs just waiting to be rebuilt.I tented in the backyard along with a few other hikers including Lou and Julie. Before dozing off, I looked in my guidebook and noticed tomorrow I would cross the 1500 mile milestone and enter a new state.

Some consider them the best falls on the AT. I think they are the loudest and most powerful, but as for pure beauty, I would give the edge to Laurel Falls and Dismal Falls.At mile 1498.8 I took a .5 mile side trail west to the cute little town of Salisbury, founded in 1741. Like my wife in a Sunday dress, it looked upscale and classy but not pretentious. Meryl Streep and her family live here, and it was also the home of Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch of the West) prior to her death. As I walked down the main drag a construction worker holding a sign asked how I was doing and how my hike was going. I told him I was hungry and Salisbury was about to solve that problem. At the Salisbury pharmacy, a kind young lady helped me find Turmeric and then, without prompting, told me where to find groceries and a place to charge my phone. She knows and loves hikers (or maybe just dug my beard) and is a good Ambassador for the town. I got some groceries and a large sub, and sat down next to Torch to eat lunch. Another hiker named Taskmaster walked by to warn us that a big storm was due in that afternoon. I filed that away in the things to possibly care about later in the day part of my brain.I left Salisbury, got back on the AT, and hiked along a really pretty and not too difficult section of trail. With storm clouds threatening, I climbed Lions Head and got water with Smiley (a retired NASA rocket scientist) at the Riga Shelter. A mile later I stopped at the Brassie Brook Shelter to have dinner with Long Strider, who showed me a picture of a large bear that he spotted a mile up the trail. It's interesting that Long Strider does a lot of slack packing (hiking without a backpack) and routinely passes me and yet he never stays ahead for long. His approach also includes the use of a fellow hiker's cars to position themselves so that they can go in the easier direction that day. He'll end up having an easier hike than me but I'm not sure his approach will get him to the end any quicker. Maybe his goal is just an easier hike.Since the storm had passed and I still had some fuel in my tank, I hiked on and made a tough descent down to the Sages Ravine Campsite. Just prior to arriving, I entered the state of Massachusetts, although the welcome sign is incorrectly placed a bit further down the trail. As I entered the state, I couldn't help but loudly say some words that I heard many times growing up as a young Philadelphia 76ers fan. Prior to their home games, the announcer's final player introduction, which I always said along with him, was...""Number 6, from the University of Massachusetts...Julius Errrrrrrr-ving!"" Julius Erving (Dr. J), Roger Staubach (Cowboys), and Mike Schmidt (Phillies) were my three main childhood sports idols. I also had crushes on Marianne (from Gilligan's Island), Julie (from the Love Boat), and the Cheryl's (Tiegs and Ladd). I digress.This popular camping area has a caretaker on site giving instructions on where and where not to camp and answering hiker questions. I sat my tent up next to Josh, an artist from near Hartford who makes a living as a handyman. He's out on a section hike but is considering a thru-hike some day.

LeeDay 130The morning hike along Sages Ravine was absolutely gorgeous. There were dozens of small waterfalls and swimming holes. Massachusetts was off to a great start. As I made the tough climb up to Mount Everett, I passed a group of young trail maintainers preparing to drill and insert metal rebar steps into the side of boulders on the most difficult portion of the climb. They are known as the Greenagers, and I thanked them for what they are doing. Many future hikers will benefit from their work. As for Fob, I had to scale the boulders sans rebar, and I did it like a Mountain Goat after getting into a case of 10 Hour Energy shots.At the Guilder Pond Picnic Area, about halfway down Mount Everett, I came to my first Massachusetts Trail Magic! During hiking season, a local woman comes to this spot every single day to refill two dozen jugs of water. What a cool thing to do! While sitting there taking a break, a van came zooming up a forest road and whipped into the parking lot. ""Great Scott!"" said I. I just assumed they were Libyan terrorists trying to get plutonium from Doc Brown. I was prepared to tell them that Doc had already used the plutonium to power his DeLorean Time Machine. But that proved to be unnecessary, as they were not terrorists. On the contrary, it was Rob and Nomad, who had arrived to do some Trail Magic! The back of Rob's van had drinks and snacks for me and several other hikers, including Long Strider, Josh, and Steve and Eric, who collectively go by the trail name Sega. They are former Special Operations troops and we know some of the same people at Special Operations Command (SOCOM).At mile 1518.8 I crossed Sheffield Egremont Road and came to the Shays' Rebellion Monument. In 1786 and 1787 Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays led 4000 rebels in rising up against perceived economic injustices and the suspension of civil rights by Massachusetts. Although the rebels suffered a military defeat, their rebellion had two history changing consequences. First, the rebellion brought George Washington out of retirement to help resolve the conflict. That eventually led him to becoming our first President. Second, national leaders called for a stronger government to deal with future rebellions, which led to the convening of a Constitutional Convention. So Shays' Rebellion was a big deal, and it came to an end in the field I walked through.A couple of miles later I arrived at US 7. Although the towns of Sheffield and Great Barrington were just a few miles away, I didn't need a re-supply. However, I did walk .2 miles west and charged my phone from an outlet on the front porch of a closed furniture store. While it was charging, I sat down under a nearby oak tree and ate supper and watched the cars go by.I hiked a couple more miles and began looking for a place to stealth camp. It was getting late, I had hiked 18.1 miles, and I was low on water, so stopping near a water source was paramount. I noticed in my guidebook that an approaching footbridge might have water underneath it. When I arrived at the footbridge I looked down and the little ravine appeared bone dry. I was really bummed as that meant I would have to hike three more miles in the dark to the next water source or get by with just a few ounces of water that evening and the next morning. Not liking either option and really needing water, I decided to look harder. I walked way up under the bridge and into a dark, narrow ravine. I saw something shiny at the base of it and that something turned out to be a just a few inches of spring water! I was so happy that I filmed a video of the water source there. I drank nearly two liters of water before going to bed.As I laid there in my tent next to the footbridge, I reflected on what had just transpired. I think there are two takeaways. First, I think some of God's blessings are near us and available to us, but it takes some extra effort on our part to find them. He showers us with countless blessings, but not all of them are dropped right in our lap. I found the water because I kept looking for it. I was borderline desperate, but I was also determined and showed some initiative. You won't find water in every seemingly dry ravine. However, you will find it occasionally simply by not giving up and making a little extra effort. I wonder how many blessings I've missed out on in life simply because I gave up too soon, not willing to try harder or look under a seemingly dry ravine.My second takeaway deals with prayer. When I get on the trail each morning, I make some very specific requests of God, based on my plans and desires for the day. I'll ask God to remove my foot numbness or to hold off on an anticipated thunderstorm until I'm in my tent that night. But since my second month on the trail, I began daily (on my first AT step of the day) asking God to ""Please give me whatever it is I need today to get through it."" Because God knows what I need better than I do. Maybe I need a little foot numbness to slow my pace to avoid injury. Maybe I need a mid-day thunderstorm, however scary, to replenish water sources that are about to dry up. Maybe he needs me to stop after 14 miles, rather than 18, because there's someone I need to meet and talk to at the campsite 14 miles away. God has the big picture and the whole picture. So I'll ask for things based on my narrow perspective, but ultimately I want the God of the big picture to give me whatever it is I need. On Day 129, I prayed that prayer. And on Day 129, God gave me what I needed...an extra ounce of energy and initiative late in the day to go looking for water under the footbridge. He placed it there, in a natural spring, and I think he might have smiled a bit when I found it.Fob","Sages Ravine Campsite

Although it was a warm and humid day, I at least crossed several streams and ponds. I played leapfrog with Sunshine and Moxie throughout the day, and enjoyed talking to them on a couple of breaks.At mile 1531.1 I went by Benedict Pond. A local section hiker told me they stock the pond with trout via helicopter. I would love to have seen a helicopter trout dump while I was there but that was not to be.My goal today was to reach and camp at the Shaker Campsite, mile 1538.2. Ann Lee, a charismatic young woman, founded the Shaker religion in Manchester, England in 1747. She claims to have had a vision that taught her that humans must renounce carnal knowledge in order to gain entrance to heaven. Thus, the Shakers practiced pacifism, celibacy, communal living, and gender equality. As someone who has practiced all four of those things on the AT, I consider myself somewhat of a Shaker and a mover. After facing persecution in England, Lee and her followers fled to America in 1774 and settled in Albany, New York. The utopian group claimed 5000 believers by the mid-19th century and spread around the northeast, to include a small settlement in a wooded valley near modern day Tyringham, Massachusetts.After 14.1 miles, I called it a day at the Shaker campsite, with a couple of remnants of their stone structures still visible. A section hiker's clothes line full of undergarments and a stuffed animal only slightly detracted from the historic feel of the area. I talked with fellow hikers ETA, Foxfire, and Apple Jack for awhile, and then gave myself a mini sponge bath at the nearby creek. I wasn't sure if standing in my underwear sponging myself by the creek was consistent with renouncing carnal knowledge, and feared my doing so might get me expelled from the Shaker Campsite. On the other hand, the sight of an emaciated Fob dripping wet in his underwear all but assured my celibacy for the foreseeable future, consistent with Shaker doctrine.Fob","Stealth Camp by Footbridge

I walked over and discovered that the enterprising young man had established a little business selling drinks, snacks, eggs and other products to hikers. The little hut, a self-service, pay as you go store, was even wired to power a refrigerator. I purchased and consumed a couple of drinks and snacks, and bought a couple more for later. It occurred to me that this young fellow, maybe around 12 years old, works harder to stock his store and earn a living than some in our country who do very little and live off welfare. A mile later I reached Main Road and discovered a cooler full of ice-cold watermelon slices. It had been a good morning.Shortly after seeing a snake at Baldy Mountain, I crossed paths with a southbound group of hikers known as the Silver Scramblers. They were a fun, motivated group of somewhat older hikers, and I enjoyed stopping and talking to them for a few minutes.At mile 1548.1 I faced a decision. Option 1 was to take a .5 mile side trail to popular Upper Goose Pond Cabin. This would give me an easy 10-mile day and an opportunity to swim in a beautiful pond and have blueberry pancakes in the morning. Option 2 was to take advantage of the relatively flat terrain and decent weather and hike eleven more miles to Washington Mountain Road. This would allow me to camp in the popular Cookie Lady's yard and enjoy her cookies (complimentary) and option to purchase hard-boiled eggs, sodas, blueberries, raspberries, and Klondike bars. Tough win-win choice, but I went with Option 2.I reached US 20 by early afternoon and went .1 mile east to a hotel to get a soda and re-charge my phone. I then pounded out ten more buggy, muddy miles and finally reached the Cookie Lady's house! Foxfire, ETA, and a couple other hikers were already there. ETA had just finished mowing some grass, something I would also have been willing to do to help the family out had the sun not been setting. For supper, I purchased two cokes, a Klondike bar, a pint of raspberries, and six hard-boiled eggs. Don't judge me...I'm a long distance hiker. The couple is in their 80s and he is in poor health and in the hospital. They have been serving cookies to hikers for decades and also offer their soft lawn for tenting. Their property is gorgeous, featuring a blueberry patch, shade trees, and a picnic table and chairs for hikers to use. Although the patriarch is ill, they had at least one child and a couple of teenage grandchildren there serving cookies, selling the other products, and keeping the tradition alive. Good on them.It had been a great 21 mile day, my tenth 20+ mile day on the AT. I like to stay under 17-18 miles per day as much as possible as that is easier on my body, more sustainable, and more enjoyable. However, I can and will go longer occasionally to reach a trail town or other special destination, and the Cookie Lady's property definitely qualifies. My only regret on the day was consuming six hard-boiled eggs before and after drinking a Coke.

I hoped he would slip and fall off a branch just as I went by so I could look at him and say ""plop goes the weasel.""In Dalton I checked in to the Shamrock Inn and showered and did laundry. Fun fact: Dalton's largest employer, Crane and Company, is the only supplier of paper for the Federal Reserve Note, the United States' paper money. Okay, so that fact isn't very fun...I'll try again later. I had a steak sandwich and salad at Angelina's and then re-supplied across the street at Sav More. I spent the rest of the evening resting and catching up on news. A side benefit of being on the trail is not having to listen to the endless political banter of this election season and other bad news. After the trail, I hope to enjoy more sunrises, sunsets, and walks and take in less news and political rants. Before bashing either unpopular presidential candidate, maybe we need to drop to a knee and pray for the eventual winner. He or she is going to need it. Just a thought. Later I ordered some House Special fried rice and spring rolls and ate dinner in bed while leaning against a soft, fluffy pillow.Fob","The Cookie Lady's Yard

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547070,"""Discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought."" - Albert Szent-GyorgyiDay 134Today was a fairly easy day of hiking with gradual climbs and descents. Near The Cobbles, a marble outcropping with views of the Hoosic River Valley, I crossed paths with Hammer and another hiker. They were doing a southbound slack pack and we shared notes on our respective upcoming terrain.At mile 1577.5 I arrived at Chesire, Massachusetts. Fun fact: in 1800 the town, known for its dairying and cheese, sent a 1,235-pound chunk of cheese, made of curds from every farmer in town, to President Jefferson. The big chunk of cheese, moved on a sled drawn by six horses and then on water, resulted in a thank you letter from President Jefferson to the Chesire farmers. Historians disagree on whether the President cut the cheese himself, or delegated the responsibility to the White House chef, Myron Toots.My only stop in Chesire was a terrific ice cream place called Diane's Twists. Upon arrival I noticed several hikers sitting at the picnic tables outside. Long Strider was finishing off a banana split. Gusteau (an LSU grad and science whiz) was sitting under a shade tree licking his ice cream cone. Other hikers had little globs of ice cream in their scraggly beards that didn't bother them a bit. Suddenly a familiar looking hiker with a thick, German, Hans Gruber from Die Hard accent approached me and said, ""Your son poop on trail."" While it's common for parents to live vicariously through their children or to be known for their children's accomplishments, it's less common to be known by the inappropriate placement of a child's bowel movement. Such is the trail life of a Fob W. Pot. I met and talked to the German hiker, Dream Catcher, at the Low Gap shelter a few months ago, and it was good to see him doing well and enjoying his great American hike. It was also good to eat a large Cookie Dough ice cream and wash it down with a cold Mountain Dew.I spent the afternoon making the 2500-foot ascent of Mount Greylock, the highest peak in Massachusetts, coming in at 3489 feet. The summit features a 93-foot-high Massachusetts Veterans War Memorial Tower, Bascom Lodge, Thunderbolt Ski Shelter, and a television and radio tower. In addition to being on the National Register of Historic Places, Mount Greylock is the location of Ilvermorny, the North American School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the fictional world of Harry Potter. Now that is a fun fact!After consuming a Coke and chips from the Bascom Lodge snack bar, I descended the mountain and ended my 20.5-mile day sleeping in the Wilbur Clearing Shelter. I met several section hikers and southbounders, including Mission, Raven, and Angel. My friend Foxfire was also there, and together we sat around a campfire sharing stories of life on the AT. Someone in the group reeked of hard boiled eggs and I couldn't get away from them, regardless of where I sat.Fob","Shamrock Inn, Dalton

About halfway down the mountain I saw Foxfire talking to two southbound hikers. It turns out they were a Canadian couple from Quebec on a section hike, and were out doing trail magic. After eating some of their raspberries, I thanked them and hiked on.At MA 2 I headed west 1/2 mile to a grocery store on the outskirts of Williamstown. I did a big food resupply and had a couple of blueberry muffins and chocolate milk for second breakfast. I returned to the trail, crossed the Hoosic River, and began a long gradual climb out of the valley.At mile 1596.3 I arrived at the Vermont border and celebrated with a Snickers bar and good conversation with several southbounders. This is also the southernmost point of the Long Trail, as it runs concurrent with the AT for the next 105.2 miles before breaking off toward Canada. A mile later, around 3 pm, I crossed paths with Long Strider on another of his southbound slack pack hikes. Little did I know that I would not see another human being for the next 24 hours.After a 12.9 mile mile day I stealth camped near Roaring Branch Pond. I was glad to be in Vermont and excited to be hiking in its famed Green Mountains. Fun fact: Green Mountains is the literal translation of the French Verts Monts, which is how Vermont was named. The idea was suggested in 1777 by Dr. Thomas Young, an American revolutionary and Boston Tea Party participant. Remember that, as it will be on the final AT exam.Fob","Wilbur Clearing Shelter

The shelter was a dump and in need of attention. I learned later that Foxfire tented near the shelter the previous night and battled mice throughout the night. They got into her food bag hanging from a tree branch and were crawling on her tent. Bummer.By mid-afternoon I reached Harmon Hill and saw a group of girls in their early teens from a day camp taking in the view. Although they were the first humans I'd seen in 24 hours, I didn't stay long because all twenty of them were talking at the same time and no one was listening. Too much humanity in one spot. It made me dizzy. I may have become an INTJ. Later, at the footbridge at Hell Hollow Brook, I caught up with Foxfire and Pigeon Toe, a retired coal miner from Kentucky.I ended my 18.6 mile day near the crowded Goddard Shelter, just as a light rain began to fall. There was an interesting combination of hikers there, including northbound and southbound AT hikers, Long Trail hikers, and day hikers. I enjoy the friendly rivalry between AT NOBOs and SOBOs. SOBOs trash talk us for not yet having done the most difficult sections of the AT, the Whites and southern Maine. We trash talk them because we have hiked a thousand more miles than they have and are smarter and better looking.Fob","Stealth Camp Near Roaring Branch Pond

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547605,"Day 137""What is a cynic? A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing."" - Oscar WildeI looked forward to today's hike because I would be climbing the 3936-foot Stratton Mountain. The mountain holds a special place in hiking history. While on the mountain in 1909, James P. Taylor came up with the idea of a trail from Massachusetts to Canada which would become Vermont's Long Trail. While on Stratton's summit during construction of the Long Trail, Benton MacKaye, a forester, planner, and conservationist, conceived the idea of a trail spanning the entire Appalachian range. His grand vision would eventually culminate in the completion of the Appalachian Trail.I have always admired visionary leaders and I have worked with and for some great ones. Jonathan Swift, an 18th century Irish writer, said that ""Vision is the art of seeing things invisible."" I love that. I think it starts with talking to people (customers, family members, etc.) about their challenges and problems. What's not working in our family, company, church, or even society? And then you start using your imagination and brainstorming about what could possibly be done to address that problem, even if it would require considerable resources, has never been done before, or initially sounds absurd. You then have to sell your vision, acquire the resources, and champion the cause until it comes to fruition.Benton MacKaye, like Thomas Jefferson, Albert Einstein, Steven Jobs, and others, was a visionary. He had a big idea and saw a really long Appalachian Trail in his head. I'm sure there were cynics coming up with all sorts of reasons why his idea wasn't realistic or plausible. There will always be cynics. Sometimes the cynics are right, because not all grand visions succeed. And yet, some grand visions do succeed. Some big dreams become a reality.So what's your vision? What do you want your family, business, church, or community to look like in 5, 10, and 20 years? What's the biggest challenge each of them faces? Have you ever really thought about it? Have you sat down with a pencil and paper and brainstormed solutions? Better yet, have you gone on a long walk in nature to think deeply about the challenges and possible solutions? You may not be the next Steven Jobs who revolutionizes an entire industry. But not all visions have to be grand. Maybe you start by just solving a persistent problem facing your family.I grew up in a family that had problems like any other family. But I always knew that my dad was somehow working on them. He was the family visionary and big problem solver, whereas mom ran the daily operations of managing the household and keeping everyone clothed, fed, and alive. As a youngster, knowing that gave me a lot of comfort. Is your vision and your approach to solving problems bringing comfort to your family, business, church, classroom or others that you may be called to lead? Or are you satisfied with the status quo, thinking the problems are too big to solve? Something to think about.So as I climbed beautiful Stratton mountain, I thought about Benton MacKaye up there dreaming big dreams of an Appalachian Trail. I also spent some time thinking about my future after the trail. I prayed about it. I thought about some things, big and small, that I'd like for Janet and me to do. I thought about some problems that need tackling and brainstormed solutions. It was a fun exercise that took my mind off the grueling climb.At the Stratton summit I walked by the tiny caretaker cabin and met the sweet couple who live there and keep an eye on things during hiking season. They grow their own food, get water from a spring, and offer helpful advice to hikers. I walked by the fire tower but decided not to climb it because I was tired and needed all my energy to get down the mountain before it got dark.At the base of the mountain I took a .5 mile side trail clockwise around Stratton Pond to the campsite on the north shore. I tented there along with Foxfire, Other Brother (an Air Force veteran and former C-130 crew chief) and a few other hikers. I built a big campfire and sat there with Foxfire discussing today's hike. It had been a good 19.5 mile day of hiking and thinking and dreaming big dreams.Fob","Near Goddard Shelter

It was a warm, muggy day but what slowed me the most were the opportunities to forage blueberries and raspberries. I love snacking on them in the wild but that does slow my pace considerably.I realized it had been 27 days since my last zero day so I decided to take a zero in the wonderful, 4-season resort town of Manchester Center, Vermont. After a 10.5 mile day, I arrived at the trailhead and stuck my thumb out. Immediately, a driver (Mr. Pike) who was about to exit the parking lot waved for me to come over and gave me the 5.4 mile ride into town. Thank you, Mr. Pike! I instantly fell in love with this quintessential New England town. It has all sorts of shopping, ranging from outlet stores to small gift shops. My sisters would love this place. It also has restaurants, ice cream parlors, bookstores, and coffee joints. Throw in a grocery store, movie theater, historic buildings and barber shop...all within easy walking distance...and you've got yourself a great town for visiting hikers.I began my afternoon with a delicious pizza at Manchester Pizza. Next, I crossed the street and got a haircut after apologizing to the barber for my dirty hair and smell. She said she couldn't smell me but I don't think that's possible. After a nice summer buzz cut, I went next door to do laundry. In the corner of the laundromat was a hiker changing area with loaner clothes to wear while you do laundry. Yes! Those are the little things that really show a town values and is attuned to the needs of its visiting hikers. I found the manager and told her that and she appreciated the feedback.After doing laundry I headed up the hill to the Palmer House. Awesome hotel! It's nicer than most places hikers stay, but I was due a decent place and their hiker rate made it reasonable. The hotel features indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a par 3 golf course, tennis courts, trout pound, and a great breakfast. After showering I walked down to Gringo Jack's for some steak and shrimp fajitas. Yum! I went to bed clean, full, and looking forward to my day off in this neat little town.Fob","Stratton Pond Campsite

He chose the name not so much for the song, but more for the idea that he is free out here to think and learn and grow. After breakfast I walked into town to do a little shopping and then had a pasta lunch at Christo's Pizza. It was good, but would have been a tad better had they not charged for soda refills. I then stopped by the Mountain Goat Outfitter in search of a new set of earbuds to replace the set I lost. The only available ones were small purple ones that are ""designed especially for women."" I bought them anyway. Had that happened earlier in my hike, I might have earned the trail name Ladybuds or Soft Lobes.I spent the rest of the afternoon at the Roubdabout Cafe, drinking coffee, blogging, and eating a salad. After some dessert at Scoops Ice Cream, I headed back to the Palmer House. I finished off a great, restful day talking to my wife, sons, and dad on the phone.

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547828,"Day 140As I made my way toward the grocery store, a car pulled up next to me and offered a ride. The driver hiked the AT a few years ago and she figured I could use a lift. After loading up on groceries, I went to a traffic signal and stuck my thumb out. Within just a few minutes, Cheryl stopped and gave me a ride to the trailhead. Manchester City gets two thumbs up in my book for being a hiker friendly town.I went right to work with a 1300-foot climb up Bromley Mountain. For the first time in my life, I was hiking up a ski run in the summer time. I tried to picture the scene in the winter with snow on the ground and downhill skiers zooming by me. At the summit I stopped for first lunch with several other hikers and then took a short rest on a ski lift chair.I descended Bromley and then climbed Styles Peek where I saw another snake. By late afternoon I arrived at the beautiful Griffith Lake. I considered tenting and swimming there, but they only had wooden tent platforms (I prefer the earth) and I still had daylight and some gas in the tank.A few miles later, after a 14.8 mile day, I arrived at Lost Pond Shelter and set up my tent. I was joined by Freebird, Gametime (from Massachusetts) and 17-year-old Black Hole, a southbounder from California. At the entrance to the camping area were two large tents full of 10-12 year old girls and two chaperones from the Plymouth Girls Club. I enjoyed talking to them and learning about their program and wilderness section hike. Later, a couple of the girls came down to the aspiring thru-hiker tenting area and said, ""We have a ton of leftover rice and beans that we don't want to pack out tomorrow. Do you guys want some?"" ""Yes, we would,"" I answered for the group and just like that, the leftovers were gone.I was not able to get a picture of all the girls because that requires parental permission. However, I got a picture of their chaperones and thanked them for the delicious rice and beans. Their generosity made me feel like an honorary member of the Plymouth Girls Club.

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547912,"""Things do not change; we change."" - Henry David ThoreauDay 141I'm starting to see now why it is so difficult for thru hikers to award AT superlatives. How can one possibly settle on a best section, view, trail magic, or anything else? Much of what makes something extra special depends on other factors such as weather, my attitude, location and intensity of body pain and/or numbness, who I'm with, etc.That being said, Vermont's Green Mountains are among the greenest, healthiest looking, and best smelling forests I've ever been in. It's a special place even though it lacks the grand views you find in the Smokies and elsewhere. Throughout today's hike, the alpine smells reminded me of the many Christmas tree shopping trips I've been on in my life. I grew up in a live Christmas tree family, unlike Janet and her artificial tree family. I enjoyed our family's tradition of picking, transporting, trimming, setting up, watering, and smelling the tree.My dad and I always ended up with sticky sap on our hands and a line of scattered needles running from the car to the living room. I remember my dad under the tree with his butt up in the air, turning the screws that held the tree in place. From my vantage point, he looked more like a plumber than an Air Force officer. Then we'd spin it to hide the bad side and then we'd hang the lights. Once the lights were operational and the tree watered, we'd turn it over to my mom and sisters to decorate it. Invariably, one of the ladies would say the tree was leaning, and Dad would go back under, with his butt up in the air, and strategically place pieces of cardboard under the appropriate tree stand legs to fix the problem. It was a sticky, time-consuming and wonderfully messy process, one that artificial tree families sadly miss out on. Those were good times and I'm happy that Janet agreed on us being a live Christmas tree family and continuing that tradition.Vermont's Green Mountains are full of perfectly looking and smelling Christmas trees. On today's hike, they were complemented by a series of rock cairn gardens that have been accurately described as a scene from the Candyland game. Over the years, hikers have added their own cairns, sometimes with a purpose in mind and sometimes not. I decided to build a small cairn in honor of Harrison and Hayley Waldron. Harrison sustained a serious traumatic brain injury in a 4-wheeling accident and has spent more than a year courageously recovering from it. Hayley has been by his side throughout the process, supporting him and keeping the faith. I have been greatly encouraged and inspired by their example as I deal with my own, much lesser challenges on the trail. So I built a rock cairn in their honor and prayed for them before hiking on.At mile 1676.8, VT 140, I arrived at some Trail Magic courtesy of the Green Mountain Club! These trail maintainers had an assortment of things to choose from, and I helped myself to two hot dogs, two brownies, and two Gatorades. After resting for 30 minutes and thanking them, I hiked up another Bear Mountain. On the way, I stopped and talked to a group of Philly teens and chaperones out on a section hike. They, like many others, are now aware that my son once pooped on the trail.The last mile of the day offered great views of the Rutland Airport and the Clarendon Gorge. The suspension bridge over the Gorge was just high and wobbly enough to make my privates tingle. Just beyond the bridge I headed half a mile down VT 103 to Qu's Whistle Stop Restaurant. In addition to great food and breakfast served all day, Qu's allows hikers to camp in the backyard of the restaurant. I met and sat with another AT hiker named Tough Love from North Carolina. He got his trail name while hiking with an M.I.T. graduate and another guy. The M.I.T. graduate was complaining about how tough it is being as smart as he is. Tough Love responded that rather than worrying about being too smart, he should focus on using his brains to better society. The third hiker, just behind them, commented, ""That's some tough love right there,"" and the name stuck.Sitting at the table next to us was Hollis Squier, the Official Town Hugger of Tinmouth, Vermont. Yes, this man's primary purpose is to give hugs to people who need them. He even has business cards. Some time ago a newspaper ran a story on him and it was read by a woman who was seriously ill and in need of a hug. Mr. Squier drove 90 minutes to meet her and her husband and give the lady a hug. After 1683 miles of hiking, Tough Love and I decided that we too could use a hug, and Mr. Squier obliged and also gave us his business card. If you're ever in Vermont and need a hug, give this guy a call.I tented that night with Tough Love and a few others in the soft lawn behind Qu's restaurant. I was warm, dry, full and had been recently hugged. At this stage of my long journey, that's about all a hiker can ask for.Fob","Near Lost Pond Shelter

After just a few miles, I began a long, challenging climb in light rain toward Killington Peak. About halfway up the mountain I stopped at the Governor Clement Shelter to get water and talk to some section hikers. I continued the grueling 2600-foot climb and eventually arrived at a crowded, dilapidated Cooper Lodge Shelter near the summit.With a big thunderstorm approaching, I quickly ate supper, hung my bear bag, and set up my tent not far from the shelter. Had the weather been nicer, I would have hiked an additional .2 miles uphill to the summit to eat at the Killington Peak Lodge, take in the views, and ride the gondola. None of that sounded appealing in a thunderstorm. Instead, I ended my 11.4 mile, all uphill day listening to the sound of heavy rain pounding my tent.

PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548708,"""In skating over thin ice, our safety is in our speed."" - Ralph Waldo EmersonDay 143Today was what most people would consider a miserable day for hiking. It rained all night, guaranteeing a muddy, slippery descent off Killington. Then, shortly after breaking camp and heading down the mountain, it started raining again. For the first time on my journey, I put on a rain poncho, more so to keep me warm rather than dry. Also for the first time, I made no effort to avoid the mud puddles. I was like a big rig driver whose brakes have failed. If I was going to get wet and muddy, I might as well have some fun with it...so I did.I have previously discussed my fondness for Stephen Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. I have related how I have applied Habit 2, Begin With the End in Mind, and Habit 7, Sharpen the Saw, while hiking the Appalachian Trail. The trail conditions on Day 143 present an opportunity to discuss Habit 1, Be Proactive. This habit involves taking responsibility for your life and owning your behavior and your response to situations. Rather than blame your parents, genetics, conditions, or circumstances for your behavior, you realize you have the freedom to choose how to respond to external stimuli. In effect, you and you alone are response-able. You focus on things you can control (your circle of influence) rather than on things beyond your control (your circle of concern).I was on a long, wet, muddy descent in the rain. It was chilly out. I was far away from my home and my loved ones. I really should be miserable. I should hate the day and the fact that I'm cold, wet, and muddy on the AT. But I don't have to feel that way. As a human being, I get to choose my response. I don't have to follow the normal, natural response to such situations. So on Day 143, I chose to be happy. I chose to splash in the mud puddles like a 10-year-old. Each of the three times I fell, I chose to laugh and give myself a score based on my technique and how well I stuck or didn't stick the landing. I chose to remember I am blessed to be on this trail and need to embrace the bad along with the good.Habit 1 can theoretically work in every situation, but we humans aren't disciplined enough to apply it in all situations. We get gloomy when it's rainy. We take offense when someone says something mean to us or about us. We get frustrated when stuck in traffic or in a slow-moving checkout line. And yet, we don't have to respond that way. We can choose something better, and I decided Day 143 was going to be a fun, memorable day of hiking.At the bottom of the mountain the rain finally stopped. I hiked through Gifford Woods State Park, crossed VT 100, and reached Kent Pond near Killington. Wet and muddy, I called the Killington Motel and the owner came and picked me up at the trailhead. I showered, did laundry, and devoured a 12"" sub at the nearby Killington deli. It had been a good, fun, rainy, muddy day on the Appalachian Trail. At least for today, I decided not to let it be miserable.Fob","Near Cooper Lodge Shelter, Killington Peak

I tried his bold Kenyan roast and loved it. I also loved the motel's all-you-can-eat breakfast featuring blueberry pancakes. My day was off to a good start.The breakfast came in handy as I powered my way up Quimby Mountain. Shortly thereafter, I was passed by a familiar looking hiker and his dog. It was Pantry, who I had not seen since we shared a cabin in Shenandoah National Park. I love these random encounters with people I met earlier in my hike.After getting water at Locust Creek, I climbed up to the Lookout, a private cabin with fantastic 360-degree views. The owner lets hikers use it as a shelter. It has a long ladder that leads to a small platform, The Lookout, on top of the roof. I climbed up it for the views and hoped that maybe James Taylor would be up there escaping from a world that's been getting him down.I hiked on and, after a 16 mile day, set up my tent near the Wintturi Shelter, mile 1720.7. I was happy to see Pantry there, as I always enjoy watching him pull various ingredients out of his massive food bag. As he prepared some sort of fancy soup concoction, I ate two tortillas with peanut butter and honey. Since he's known as Pantry I should probably be known as Cupboard's Bare. As we sat there eating by the shelter, he told me about two interesting experiences he has recently had. First, he hiked with a guy who bought too much at a trail town grocery store and ended up hiking with two large summer sausages duct taped to each of his trekking poles. Ingenious...almost. That night a bear came and took the poles from beside his tent with the sausages still attached to them!At another campsite Pantry stayed at, an anonymous person called 911 and said that someone at the campsite had a gun. Next thing you know a ""mini SWAT team"" was on the scene, going from tent to tent looking for the nonexistent hiker with the gun. Pantry had no weapon for them, but could've given them dried lentils, kale, and more than a dozen herbs and spices. By the way, they investigated, determined who made the call, and arrested that hiker at another campsite for filing a false report.Fob","Killington Motel, Vermont

I headed .2 miles west off the trail to visit On the Edge Farm, where I ate my first homemade rhubarb pie, along with a chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and Mountain Dew. Loved the rhubarb pie, even though I'm not exactly sure what a rhubarb is. I think they also use it to reinforce steel.After six miles of roller coastering on a hot day, I arrived at Cloudland Road with plans to make another .2 mile diversion to Cloudland Market. However, this proved to be unnecessary because I hit some Vermont Trail Magic! First there was a cooler with drinks and goodies just before the road. And then at the road, Gas Tank was set up with a full complement of snacks and drinks. A southbound AT hiker, he fell and tore his meniscus in the Whites and decided to provide some magic during his recuperation at home in Vermont. I'm not entirely sure what or where a meniscus is. It sounds like something a woman has or does that might make her grouchy. I will look it up after researching rhubarb and report back on both.I received word from several SOBOs about an awesome couple, Randy and Linda, who live in a house by the White River in West Hartford. (Not to be confused with Big Steve and Lil Jan, who live in a van down by the river.) This amazing couple feeds and shelters over 1000 hikers each year. I was also told they have a dog who will come after you barking, but will return peacefully to the porch after you pet him. Sure enough, at mile 1737.1, after a 16.4 mile day, I crossed the White River and headed toward the house with the big AT symbol on its barn. I heard barking and then saw Cujo's grandson charging at me as he slobbered. I quickly jumped out of his way, nearly tweaking my...meniscus? After petting him, he returned to the porch to wait for the next hiker.Linda and Randy feed hikers breakfast, lunch, and dinner...whatever meal you're there for...at no cost (optional donation jar). They also offer free lodging in the barn's mattress-filled loft or you can camp in their yard. On top of that, you can swim/bathe in the White River across the street or even take a 30-foot jump off the bridge into the water. After eating four grilled hot dogs and drinking two orange sodas, I claimed a bed in the barn's loft, and then headed to the river. I stripped down to my faded, oversized, pathetic, droopy, synthetic underwear and swam out into the rapids. Being full of rhubarb and already having tweaked my meniscus, I opted not to jump off the bridge. I enjoyed a peaceful rest of the evening along with Tough Love, Tin Man, Task Master, and several other hikers. It was good to be in West Hartford, a town flooded and nearly wiped off the map in 2011 by Hurricane Irene. It was also good to meet and receive kindness from Linda and Randy, two of Vermont's finest citizens.Fob","Near Wintturi Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548888,"Day 146The trail seemed a tad easier today and I frequently heard the sound of loggers in the distance. I often wonder if they hear me when I fell the occasional wilderness log.By mid-afternoon I reached the adorable, upscale town of Norwich. Bob Keeshan, better known as Captain Kangaroo, was from there, in addition to many other of Vermont's wealthiest residents. I headed .1 mile west to Dan and Whits General Store, known for its decent prices, good selection of groceries, and narrowest aisles on the AT. They also give hikers any available day-old deli sandwiches for free, so I downed a free roast beef sandwich after re-supplying. Three of my fellow hikers were asked to help an elderly woman across the street move a piece of furniture, and she rewarded them with some leftover food in the fridge, unaware it had mold on it. Awkward.After purchasing a 50 cent cup of lemonade from a young man in front of the store, I continued my journey over the Connecticut River...and into the great state of New Hampshire! Any state with the motto ""Live Free or Die"" is alright by me. After taking and posting the obligatory new state photo, I climbed the state's first hill right into the bustling college town of Hanover.I could have spent a week in Hanover taking in all of its sights, sounds, eateries and shops. Instead, I spent about four hours. My first stop was to an outfitter to pick up a package Janet mailed to me. I now have my stove and winter gear again. I then had a free slice of pizza and large salad at Ramunto's Brick Oven Pizza. I stopped into the nearby Verizon store and upgraded my phone with more storage. Not quite full, I headed back to the main drag and had a large ice cream at Morano Gelato and then two pastries (one free) at Umpleby's Bakery Cafe. I hit a couple of gift shops which were of course full of all things Dartmouth. On my way out of town, I stopped at the Co-Op food store for a couple of Gatorades and bananas.The AT goes by the Dartmouth stadium and practice fields and then up into the woods. I hiked about 1.5 miles and then, after an 11.3 mile day, set up my tent near Velvet Rocks shelter. I overheard a fellow hiker tell another hiker that a third hiker he knew had received a goat as a present from his parents and intended to hike with it the rest of the way to Katahdin. I laid in my tent considering the pros and cons of hiking the AT with a goat. There are some upsides, but overall I'd say it's a b-a-a-a-a-d idea.Fob","Barn Loft, Mile 1737.1

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548969,"""I'm your ice cream man, stop me when I'm passin' by, oh my my..."" - Van HalenDay 147Today was a record day for meeting SOBO hikers. I greeted all of them and spoke a bit longer with a few of them. They were glad to have survived The Whites and offered me some key tips that would pay dividends later. After a fairly tough climb up Holts Ledge, there was a turnoff for the Trapper John Shelter, apparently named in honor of the MASH character. Some day I hope to have a dilapidated, porcupine-infested privy on a blue blazed side trail named after me. It will be called The Fob Pot.At mile 1764.6, just passed Dorchester Road, I took a short side trail to the home of the late Bill Ackerly. Mr. Ackerly, who passed away just a few months ago, was known in AT circles as The Ice Cream Man. After filling hikers' bellies with ice cream, he would then beat them at croquet on his perfectly manicured backyard croquet course. According to a note on my AT Guthook app, his family plans to continue the ice cream tradition for one more year. It also said hikers could get water, use the outhouse, access the free WiFi, and ask about camping in the yard. When I arrived at about 4 p.m., no one was home and there were no cars in the driveway. I debated what to do. Should I stay or hike on? I asked myself, what would The Ice Cream Man want me to do? So, I set up my tent in the backyard at the edge of the croquet course, got water, accessed the WiFi, and made myself at home. I suppose I was technically trespassing, but it seemed like a risk worth taking. As the sun began to set on his still perfectly manicured croquet course, I regretted that I was not able to meet Mr. Ackerly, eat his ice cream, or lose to him at croquet. If it's possible to miss someone you've never met, I suppose that's how I felt about The Ice Cream Man.Fob","Near Velvet Rocks Shelter

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549056,"""And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased."" - Hebrews 13:16""Keep learning about the world. Use your mind to the hilt. Life passes quickly and, towards the end, gathers speed like a freight train running downhill. The more you know, the more you enrich yourself and others."" - Susan TrottDay 148Prior to entering The Whites, hikers are presented with a couple of 3000' appetizers known as Smarts Mountain and Mount Cube. It is New Hampshire's way of saying, ""Welcome suckers! If you think this is bad, you ain't seen nothin' yet!"" The climb up Smarts Mountain runs along quartzite-covered Lamberts Ridge and is tough to navigate in a few places. It also lacks water for eight miles, so I was glad that I had cameled up at the spigot at The Ice Cream Man's house. After descending the mountain, I stopped and got water at South Jacobs Brook and talked to a couple of SOBO Aussies for awhile.After climbing over rocky Mount Cube in the heat of the late afternoon, I was drenched in sweat and exhausted. I finally reached NH 25A at mile 1780.6 with about 30 minutes of daylight remaining, after a 16 mile day. I happened to see a hiker's note in my Guthook app that said there was a sweet elderly couple nearby who take in hikers. It said they have a sign to that effect at the trailhead and that they were .3 miles west up a hill, then a right on East Cemetery Road, and then the second house on the right.At the trailhead I looked around and there was no sign. I debated what to do. I could drop my tent right there at a soccer field by the trailhead...the safe, easy option. Or I could follow the directions of some unknown hiker and try to find an elderly couple's teal home about .3 miles away, in the hopes that they still take in hikers. I decided to go for it and headed west on 25A in search of elderly people who may take in hikers. After a fairly steep, .3 mile climb up the paved road, I came to...absolutely nothing. No neighborhood. No humanity. Nothing. Maybe it was bad Intel. With the sun starting to set, I decided to continue on for just five more minutes before returning to the soccer field defeated. Two minutes later, I spotted a sign indicating a right turn ahead! Could it be East Cemetery Road? I quickened my pace and, sure enough, it was East Cemetery Road! Just like the seemingly dry ravine of a prior post, the seemingly road to nowhere would also bear fruit, thanks to a little extra effort late in the day.I turned right and walked up to the teal house, the second one on the right. I rang the doorbell and got no response. I rang it again and suddenly the second floor window opened and a little grey-headed woman stuck her head out. ""Can I help you?"" she asked. ""My name is Fob and I heard that you and your husband might take in hikers,"" I replied. She said, ""We normally do but we decided to take this week off. We took the sign down at the trailhead."" ""That's okay, no worries,"" I replied. ""I'll just set up down at the soccer field. I'm sorry to bother you."" ""No, that won't be necessary, just come on around to the porch, we'd love to have you,"" she said. After apologizing for even being there on their week off and confirming that it wouldn't be a problem, I made my way over to the porch and met her at the door.Rita Pease, in her 80s and better known as ""Toni"", invited me in and told me to have a seat on the couch next to the recliner where her husband was sitting. Her husband, Jerry, is in his mid-80s and very friendly. He seemed like a cross between John Wayne and Paul Bunyan. I felt bad sitting on their couch because my profuse sweating made it seem like I had just gotten out of a swimming pool.Grandma Toni (as I call her) returned from the kitchen, handed me a ham sandwich, and sat down near her husband. ""Fob, here's your appetizer,"" she said. ""You can eat this while we watch Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. We have the whole first season on DVD!"" ""Oh good!"" said I, for no apparent reason. Still soaking wet, I sat there on the couch, eating a ham sandwich while watching a very attractive Dr. Quinn administer medicine in 1867 Colorado. If I lived in Colorado in 1867 and Dr. Quinn was my doctor, I think I would come down with the sniffles every day.As I sat there with my two adopted grandparents, I wondered whether the main course Grandma Toni had planned for me would happen at the end of episode 1 (the sooner option) or the end of season 1 (the later, binge watching option). I also wondered whether all this...being in an elderly couple's home...in a New Hampshire town I didn't even know the name of...covered in sweat...eating a ham sandwich...watching Dr. Quinn...was real or just a bizarre dream. It felt like a tv episode that might result if the writers of The Twilight Zone collaborated with the writers of The Andy Griffith Show.At the conclusion of the quite good episode of Dr. Quinn, Grandma Toni brought me a TV dinner featuring chicken pot pie, green peas, and peach cobbler. It was delicious, although it made my stomach a little upset and I was afraid we might have to call Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, to check me out. After dinner, Grandma Toni showed me my upstairs bed and bathroom and asked for my dirty laundry so she could put a load in. Bless her soul. She told me to come back down after showering because they had a video for me to watch.Feeling full and clean, I returned to the family room, hoping it would be to watch the next episode of Dr. Quinn. I'm curious as to whether the obvious chemistry between her and the rugged outdoorsman, Byron Sully, will ever amount to anything. Or is my curiosity just the byproduct of wearing women's earbuds for several days?Instead, Jerry showed me a 30 minute documentary done by the Discovery Channel a decade or so ago about their family. It turns out Jerry was a 4th generation sugarer, and his son now runs the business in its 5th generation. Sugaring, I learned, is the process used to create maple syrup, and the video shows Jerry walking around the family farm and explaining the process from beginning to end. There is so much more to it than just squeezing Aunt Jemima at your local IHOP. I learned they have 1200 taps across the farm, half using buckets to collect the sap and half using tubing. I learned how they transport it, boil it, and package it. I learned that it takes 40 gallons of sap to make a single gallon of real organic maple syrup. I peppered Jerry with questions and he happily answered all of them. I found it all quite fascinating. He explained some of their family traditions, like the children pouring newly made, still warm syrup over snow to make candy. I wondered if Dr. Quinn ever tapped a tree to make organic maple syrup but didn't ask.Grandma Toni then joined us to tell some more stories, of which I'll share one. She and Jerry were traveling the country by train in 2001 and were scheduled to meet a friend and tour the South Tower of the World Trade Center on the morning of 9/11. While on a 4-hour layover at a Chicago train station, they overhead a fellow passenger say that she would be catching a train to New York City in an hour. They went to the ticket window and inquired about changing tickets in order to depart for New York in an hour, rather than four hours. They were able to change tickets and were on their way an hour later. With this earlier than anticipated arrival, they called their friend in New York to see about touring the South Tower the afternoon earlier, on 9/10. The friend agreed and they ended up on the last South Tower tour of the day on 9/10. The next morning at their hotel, they watched in horror with the rest of us as the World Trade Center fell to the ground. They felt like their lives had been spared for a purpose and that they had been given a new lease on life. If their treatment of me is any indication of the way they treat the dozens of other hikers who stay at their home each year, I think they have found that purpose.As disappointed as I was to never meet Mr. Ackerly, The Ice Cream Man, I was thrilled to have had the opportunity to meet, talk to, and be hosted by Jerry and Toni Pease. When I return home after my AT hike, I plan to send them a thank you note along with Season 2 of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. After I finish watching it, of course.Fob","Ice Cream Man's Yard

Sir FoB W. PoT,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549235,"""You can do anything you set your mind to, man"". - Eminem, Lose YourselfDay 149I awoke to the wonderful smell of sizzling bacon. I followed my nose downstairs where Grandma Toni had prepared a huge breakfast. She brought me a plate with four pieces of French toast, two eggs, and three strips of bacon. Grandpa Jerry explained that the syrup on the table was ""the good stuff"" from their own farm. It was the best syrup I've ever had. Sorry, Aunt Jemima. Just as I finished off my first plate of food, Grandma Toni brought out a second plate identical to the first one. ""You're not my first thru-hiker,"" she explained. I ate everything but the 8th piece of French toast. After packing up, I thanked this amazing couple for their generous hospitality and gave them each a huge hug. I then returned to the trail and continued my northbound journey to Katahdin.Near mile 1782.4, Cape Moonshine Road, a gentleman was set up right along the trail in the woods providing Trail Magic! It had been over an hour since I had Grandma Toni's breakfast so I was definitely ready for the 4-egg omelette Big Tom was offering. He has been doing Trail Magic on this spot throughout the hiking season and had an obvious love for hikers and the AT.After a fairly easy 9.8 mile day, I arrived at NH 25 and headed east .3 miles to the Hikers Welcome Hostel. After eating and re-supplying at a nearby gas station, I joined Firefly, Pyro, Tin Man, Kiwi, Virginia Creeper and several others in the hiker lounge. Later, my hiking buddy Foxfire came strolling in and said, ""Fob, John says hi."" ""John who?"" I replied. Foxfire answered, ""Some guy named John in a pickup truck pulled up by me as I crossed a road earlier today and asked me if I knew Fob. When I told him I did, he said he loves reading your blog on Trail Journals and to tell you hello and keep hiking and writing."" That's just crazy. John, whoever you are, thanks for that message and for reading my blog and following my journey. You and others who have posted comments on Trailjournals or Facebook have had a huge impact on me at some times when I really needed it. I read and appreciate every comment.After some discussion on which two movies to watch of the hundreds of options, we settled on the rather strange combination of Road to Perdition and Joe Dirt. If the United States ever ceases to be and a future civilization studies our culture, may they never unearth a Joe Dirt DVD and judge us based on it.Fob","Pease Home, Near mile 1780.6

With every broken bone, I swear I lived."" - One Republic, I LivedDay 150As the dozen or so hikers found seats around the table in the hiker lounge, there was a little more excitement and nervous anticipation than normal. Part of that may have been due to the smell of dozens of pancakes about to be served to us by the hostel staff. But even more than that, our minds were on the mighty White Mountains that awaited us. We were like a bunch of anxious football players in the locker room moments before the big game.Most AT thru hikers consider The Whites, which run from New Hampshire to southern Maine, to be the most difficult section of the entire trail. New Hampshire has forty-eight 4000 footer mountains and most of those are in The Whites. They include 6288-foot Mount Washington, home to the worst weather on the planet, and Mount Madison, which some consider the AT's toughest climb. The Whites are also home to Mahoosuc Notch, a mile long boulder field that is considered the toughest and most fun mile on the AT.So The Whites are a huge test and challenge for AT hikers. The Whites are where you most need your 2000-mile, rock hard trail legs. The Whites are where you tap the reservoir of courage and determination you've been building up since Springer Mountain. The Whites are where you're glad you had that 4th egg, 6th piece of bacon, and 7th piece of French Toast.Fueled by pancakes, coffee, and adrenaline, I exited ""the locker room"" and excitedly made my way to the base of 4802-foot Mount Moosilauke, the first of the mighty White Mountains.And that, dear readers, is where my AT blog comes to an end. I have decided to shift my energies from writing a blog to writing a book! The book will hopefully be released some time in 2017. It will cover my entire journey, to include the not yet blogged about last 35 days on the trail. It will detail, among other things...- A devastating fall in southern Maine that left me bloodied, shaken, and minus a trekking pole.- A crazy mile-long rock scramble through Mahoosuc Notch, and a brutal climb up and over Mount Washington in high winds and rain.- An incredible final week in Maine's 100-Mile Wilderness.- An amazing reunion with my wife, dad, and a life-long friend.- My final climb and (spoiler alert) summit of Katahdin! That's right, Fob is now officially an AT thru hiker! On September 13th, I became the 650th NOBO hiker to summit Katahdin! I hit every white blaze on the 2189.1 mile AT and carried my own pack the entire way.- The final moments and my thoughts as I delivered my mom's ashes to their final resting place.- How my faith in God has changed as a result of my hike.                         - The results of our collective fund-raising efforts to help the Colon family adopt a child.- My AT superlatives, lessons learned, and recommendations for future hikers.- My plans for the future to include a few new bucket list items.- A long list of people to thank who have helped me, cheered for me, enabled my AT journey, and encouraged me to write a book.If you would like to receive an email when the book is ready for ordering, please send your email address to thebigsteve66@gmail.com. I will not share your email address or use it in any way other than to notify you of the book's release.Hiking the AT has been the most challenging, difficult, and interesting thing I've ever done. It was everything I hoped for and more. I'm thankful to God for sustaining me in every way imaginable on this incredible journey. And I'm thankful to each of you for joining me on this journey and encouraging me each step of the way. Thank you so much for reading my blog!
