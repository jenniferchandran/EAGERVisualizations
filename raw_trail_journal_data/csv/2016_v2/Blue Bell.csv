Blue Bell,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540940,"Last weekend a friend and I went to Waynesboro with a load of soda, fruit, snack cakes and sandwich fixin's.   This opened the door for us to meet and talk to hikers on the Blue Ridge Parkway and on Skyline Drive in the Shenandoah. Every one of them were friendly and took time to answer my questions about the trail and their hike.   They were very happy to get the treats. I hope that I built up some good Karma toward my 2017 flip-flop out of Rockfish.   ",,"Waynesboro, VA","Jul 05, Tue",0
Blue Bell,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541729,"Last night, a friend asked if she could go with me. I really thought she was joking. But the more we talked, the more I realized she might be serious. She said yes, she is serious. So it looks like we might be hiking together.",,View Entry,"Jul 06, Wed",0
Blue Bell,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543021,Country Girl has committed to hiking the trail with me.   This is going to be so much fun. The waiting for April 2017 is the hardest part.   The gear is ready and the girl is ready.,,"Waynesboro, VA","Jul 07, Thu",0
Blue Bell,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544745,"Country Girl and I headed up to Castleton, Indiana to visit the REI store there.   It is a 3 hour drive but well worth it. These amazing people patiently answered all my questions including several really dumb ones, I am sure.   I now have a new Osprey pack which fits amazingly, Lexi poles and La Sportiva Surround Gortex boots.",,My Favorite Store---REI Castleton,"Aug 05, Fri",0
Blue Bell,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550035,"Country Girl, her husband Bear Bait and I did a overnight shakedown at Land Between the Lakes in western Kentucky over the weekend.   We made camp on the ridge above Lake Barkley after hiking about 4 miles from the trail-head.   It was an amazing campsite. Yesterday morning we broke camp and hiked another 6-7 miles before ending the hike because Country Girl got sick.   I highly recommend a shakedown. All three of us have backpacking experience.   I had hiked a few times already with my new pack and gear, but still I learned a lot.   There are lots of little things that I had just not thought of when planning on paper.   Having experienced the ""little things"" and worked out fixes leaves me confident that I can do this.   I am even more excited about my 2017 thru hike than ever.   Just 28 weeks.   Bring it on!",,Shake down,"Oct 04, Tue",0
