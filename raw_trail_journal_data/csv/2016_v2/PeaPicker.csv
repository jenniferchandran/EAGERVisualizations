PeaPicker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/426082,"Today begins my journey.I have made the decision,have talked it over with my wife Mairlyn(apprehensive),and started training.This is certainly going to be a challenge.A thru-hike of the Appalachian trail. First just the logistics of it all.Secondly I'm a little worried about how well my body and heart will hold up.I have a pacemaker/defibrillator which will add a challenge to the hike.After all, how many people hike with an electric start, and a device to speed up or slow down the heart.In fact this should be an advantage.I have ask my daughter(Shawna) to go with me,she has tentatively said yes,but I'm not sure she is convinced.Would be something very special if I could have her all to myself for six months.I have spent the last 2 months devouring everything I can find on the trail and visiting with people online.What a wonderful group of people.Open arms and positive encouragement from all.Will now start shopping for gear to train with.Lightweight seems to be the common thread for everything.More to follow as I progress thru a journey of a lifetime.",,The Greatest Mountain,"Jul 18, Thu",0
PeaPicker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/426885,Ordered my backpack today.Have made a good decision I think. Osprey Aether 70.A little heavy at 4lbs12oz but planning on making up for it on tent and sleeping system.Continue to read all I can find and talk to anyone who is willing to answer my questions.,,View Entry,"Jul 20, Sat",0
PeaPicker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/426886,"Talked to my daughter again and sent some information via Facebook,videos of the trail and some personnel stories of other people.I am still hopeful she will go,but will not push her this MUST be her choice.I am starting to feel the trail whisper to me,if you believe that sort of thing. Kind of a beckoning to my spirit.Have looked at many sleep systems but the one I'm considering most is the quilt and pad.The tent is still a toss up the choices being MSR Hubba and Big Agnes Fly.",,View Entry,"Jul 21, Sun",0
PeaPicker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/427450,"My backpack has arrived and I am very excited.I opened it up tried it out for fit and of course the hip belt is a little tight...ok a lot tight.I will need to swap this out for a little bigger one, to get the right fit on the hips.I remember them asking for torso size but not hip belt size, they probably did.Called Osprey and they will exchange for me no problem.This for me helps the AT thru hike start to take on real meaning.I am still reading everything I can get my hands on,evaluating all the gear,sleeping bags,stoves ,footwear,clothes,rain gear,and on and on.However it's so much fun. Have discovered www.whiteblaze.net and really like it.I know there are more like it, and hope to find them, as I will have read all of this site soon.",,View Entry,"Jul 26, Fri",0
PeaPicker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/429780,"After much reading,I have decided my pack was too heavy at 4lbs 12 oz, and will return it for a lighter pack,more on this later.I continue my training and reading.I am up to a 1 1/2 mile a day walk and am considering joining a gym for some weight lifting to boost a little muscle mass.I am intrigued by the ultra light concept in backpacking, and will continue to try and adopt as much of it in my hike as possible.I would like to average around 30lbs for my pack at start and resupply,to include food, water, and gear.I think this achievable without giving up much comfort.Thanks to all who have signed my guestbook and look forward to meeting those of you who will be hiking 2015 AT.",,View Entry,"Aug 12, Mon",0
PeaPicker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/432369,"Sent my backpack back and exchanged it for a Therm A Rest NeoAir Xlite large and a Sea To Summit bag liner Compact Plus.Happy with the exchange, and will purchase a sleeping bag next.For now,I'm going to hold off on another backpack and work on purchasing a tent, and some clothes, and accessories like stove and other small stuff.Exercise is going well I'm very please with my progress to get in shape.So far I'm doing it all in a gym setting,but will in about six months start to make transition to outside activities.Read an interesting article on budgeting here is the link...http://blissfulhiking.blogspot.com/search/label/Budgeting .My saving plan IS NOT going as planned. Need more discipline or a bigger income.Better work on the discipline part.My daughter going with me is seeming less likely from month to month.We shall see.The more I read about the Appalachian Trail the more I'm thinking solo not a bad idea anyway.",,View Entry,"Aug 30, Fri",0
PeaPicker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/434626,"Got a little bad news from my devib/pacemaker doctor.She does not recommend a hike of the AT. Reasons are my heart failure past, has done so much damage to the lower (ventricle)part of my heart, that the daily calorie loss, and the daily cardiac stress, in her opinion is just too risky. She however, likes the fact that I'm doing daily walks ,and moderate cardio exercises, and encourages me to continue. I will. Have made an appointment with my doctor to discuss the subject a little more. His nurse who did the initial interview is very familiar with the Appalachian Trail and sees no reason I could not do little parts of it at a time,some in the spring and some in the fall.I have an appointment with him at the end of September. At this point I'm am not completely convinced, that if I just take my time, and do not push out too many miles a day ,that I can still do this.",,View Entry,"Sep 18, Wed",0
PeaPicker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/436199,"September 30 2013 I visited with my Doctor, and the results where not what I had hoped for. His exact words where ""you look better in person than on paper"" and based on what I'm looking at on paper it's just not advisable .I am not going to spend time here with the particulars ,suffice it to say the team says no. I've spent the last couple days, a little down, to say the least. My daughter, and my wife, have both said to do little parts at a time. I love them both so very much. I am not sure just yet, how I'm going to hike the trail,but I""M GOING TO HIKE THE TRAIL. I'm going to continue to train, prepare, put together my equipment, take my shake down hikes, and come March 2015 I'm climbing those damn stairs in Georgia and if or when I get to the top it's one foot in front of the other and I'll go from there.",,View Entry,"Oct 02, Wed",0
