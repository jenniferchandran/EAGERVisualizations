Hoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516359,"One tip: You have heard of how much hungier you will be on the trail, that is true, but it won't happen at the start. So make sure you don't over-think the amount of food you will eat and carry tbat first week. It is a good idea to have eaten the dinners you plan to eat that first few days before the hike to ensure you like it and will want to eat it again. My first two days I had made was more then I wanted to eat and wound up carrying it until I could dispose of it properly.","

Hope none of us planning to hike, come as badly prepared as Katz. I know that reading past journals and books written by past hikers has been a great deal of help to me.Wishing all safe training as we prep for the spring.","

Hoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516609,"Like many of you I have searched out journals of those who might be around my age, to see mileage weight, gear, etc...    hope there are some who will start out slow and we can share the ups and downs at least. HYOH, I know.Following is a verse, taken from ""On the Loose"" by Terry and Renny Russell's book on adventure and the environment.So why do we do it?What good is it?Does it teach you anything?Like determination?Invention?Improvisation? Foresight?Hindsight?Love?Art?Music?Religion?Strength or patience or accuracy or quickness or toleranceor which wood will burn and how long is a day and how far is amile and how delicious is water and smokey green-pea soup?And how to rely on yourself?Food for thought...","

Hoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517963,"To those who have decided to hike the trail, do not allow others to tell you about what sucess is measured by. Even if you don't make it all the way, you have attempt what many others have not. I submit to you (both men and women) the words of Teddy Roosevelt,""It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled or were the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly, who errs, and comes short again and again - - - who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and at worst, if he fails, at least fails so greatly so that his place shall never be with those timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.""I have found it to be of great help remembering this during tough times. I hope it will strengthen your resolve when you get frustrated and discouraged on your hike.Hoot","

Hoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518197,"First, very disappointed that there was little or no acknowledgement in paper or TV about the significance of this day in our history. To any World War II veterans who just might read this, thank you for your service, I won't forget this day.Second, I have found a great way to while away some hours during a cross country flight. I took an AT trail guide, an AT map, pen and paper, and started an imagined hike. I reviewed various scenarios as if I could actually make it from shelter to shelter, or even further. This took my mind far afield and the time , excuse the pun, flew by. At the end I had a good idea of how many meals I wou,d need between resupply or nero/zero days. Unfortunately, I only got as far as Fontana Dam before the flight landed!!Fortunately, my wife and I are headed to Australia for Christmas, to visit her family, soooo I will have plenty of time to finish my imaginary thru-hike as I think the flight lasts about 16 hours!!Hoot","

Hoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520019,"Just flew in and boy are my arms tired! Hit the cymbals! Had a great time downunder, summer in the southern hemisphere was perfect. If you ever get the chance you must go to Australia, if you want to hike, go to Tasmania, the island state, best known for the many hiking trails. Additionally you would get to fly 15 hours in an Airbus 380, 4 turboengines, which carries 450 or more people. They have 1st class and premium business class and then they have economy. As a frugal shopper, economy works for me, you even get your own entrance onto the plane, no meeting up or seeing what your missing by not going 1st class. The airline makes you feel right at home and made the flight although long passed quickly. I had plenty of time to go over AT plans, equipment, mileage and meals. I have enjoyed catching up with reading journal entries and looking forward to following all already hiking, wish them warmer days ahead.","

So, plans for late March start has slipped to mid-April, for family reasons. Happily they are good family reasons, my wife has decided that we need to spend some time in Portland, OR with our three granddaughters, one whose birthday is April 3rd, and springbreak is also occuring. Wishing all already hiking and those preparing the very best weather and safe trek, will be following your journals until I get on the trail.Hoot","

Hoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528233,"No signal last night. Stayed a Hogpen gap after 7 miles. Met two young men Ohio, sat and talked by a small fire. We were sung to by a barred owl, made the day. Lots of trillium, violets and juncos, others. Today was a lot of PUDs, pointless ups and downs.   That's all until I figure how to send pictures.","Low Gap shelter

Hoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529227,"OK, My bad, I have been writing but not hitting the POST emblem????!!!Started 15 April, went from Neels Gap to HogPen Gap, water source, so tired so went for water and met two young men from Ohio, we had a small fire and talked of careers and plans. After telling my Trail name, Hoot, we heard a Barred Owl, soo cool!16 April: Moved on toward Low Gap Shelter, pretty sunny day wound up going over two ""mountains"", Poor Mt(3620) and Sheep Rock Mt(3576) with a gap between, obviously. This site filled up quickly, few level spots, so I am very please I have decided to hammock!17 April: Blue Mt shelter; Weather has been perfect, lots of PUD's(pointless ups and downs) Very slow on the downhills, but seeing lots of flowers, and great views as I get to rest frequently.18 April: Cheese factory; site of an old goat farmer who made cheese back in the early 19th century, nothing there now but flat ground and a water source. Meet a couple with a dog, from near Bedford, where I went to High school. Heard Barred owls again. Nice enough to hang without tarp over head, so looking at stars and moon.19 April: Too far to next camping area with water, so stopped at SWAG of the BLUE Ridge, flat area with this sign and a campsite. Since I was low on water, planned to eat lunch and conserve my 700 ml of water. The Al and 2 time thru hiker came walking up and decided to stay, shared his water and stories, we had a fire and a long talk. He has been living in southeast Asia for the last 10 years. Needless to say he has some wild stories and has sticker shock on the price of things in the U.S.20 April: Deep Gap shelter; just short of Dicks Creek Gap, over 25 folks here waitng for short 3 mile hike into the gap and enjoying a chance to go to town.I plan to take what is called a Zero day, no hiking,reload food for next 40 miles, before getting to the next town, Franklin, NC.21 April: the Top of Georgia Hostel, (2 years old) OUTSTANDING facility, highly recommend staying here. Went to all you could eat buffet, $8.95, fried chicken, ribs, mash potatoes/gravy, Yes, Deb I ate a huge salad!!Thanks to those who have tried to follow, and have messaged me. Really has been fun. Will get a better idea over the next week, may be able to look ahead to where I might be to meet up with you Bill, Robin.Hoot","Top of Georgia Hostel

Hoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530529,"Because of my worries of losing battery power for making contact with the wife and being too tired to write at the end of the day, I stopped trying to keep this updated daily.24 April; back on the trail, up,up, up out of Dicks Creek Gap, heading North, hike all day and went past Plumorchard Gap shelter to a little used camping site, with water at mile 76.3, spent evening with 6 others. Nice evening getting to know a little about everyone as we sat by the small fire. No rain in the forecast so I went without my tarp and had a great view of the stars, and many fireflies.25 April; Al and I were the last ones on the trail, so off we go hiking up and over a few ""hills"", ending at tbe next shelter for the night, this one is Muskrat Creek shelter,(81.4) entirely different group of hikers. We are attempting to get to shelters as my hiking companion presently has no tent or tarp. At this shelter we have met our first foreigner, Swiss, huge guy with a huge pack! I don't see how alot of the folks are doing this hike with 40, 50, even 60 lbs. I have hung by a stream, and will again go without tarp for more night sky viewi g as I nod off to sleep.26 April; Long, hard uphill climb up Standing Indian mountain, arriving at below the summit at 4pm (86.3), very windy site, most of the dry wood for a fire has been used by earlier hikers, no fire tonight. Met a couple in their 70s doing a two day hike in the area, both have hiked lots of the AT, gave us good idea what to expect tomorrow. Rain possible so up goes the tarp, no rain during the night.27 April; Hiked up and over Standing Indian Mountain , down to the small sign marking GA/NC border, then a little further to the most photographed tree on the AT at Bly gap. Then we go up again until we go down into Carter Gap shelter (93.9). Today I was feeling minor pains in my left knee on the downhills, and it was slowing me down a good deal. I felt that this might be the end, next morning it was still very difficult on the downhills, so I decided to call this hike at an end. Walked on to Mooney Gap (98.8). Just before Albert Mountain, where we were able to get a ride into Franklin, NCI am confident that in my mind I could do a thru hike, but my chronic RA, and need to step carefully when going down will keep that from occurring. Hopefully, the knee pain will diminish and I will do more of the trail.I really enjoyed these days out on the trail, the people I met, the trail magic, the wild flowers, the scenery, the night sky and hearing owls at night!!!!Thanks to all who tried to keep up with my travels, I appreciate your support on facebook.Hoot","

Hoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518432,"Shout out to Replay, for meeting up and talking AT over lunch! To those planning to hike I submit the following;This I have been told with some regularity that by walking out and away I am "" 'escaping from reality."" I admit that the question puts me on the defensive. Why, I ask myself, are people so ready to assume that chilled champagne is more real than water drawn from an ice---cold mountain spring? Or a dusty sidewalk than a carpet of desert dandelions? Or a Boeing 707 than a flight of graceful white pelicans soaring in unison against the sunrise? Why, in other words, do people assume that acts and emotions are values that stem from the city life are more real than those that arise from the beauty and the silence and the solitude of wilderness?----Colin Fletcher, from The Complete Walker","
