I have a new adventure planned for this year - the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu! This has been a dream of mine for many years, and I decided to do it this year.I also hope to continue section hiking on the AT after I return from Peru. I have an amazing trip planned that will also include delivering school supplies along the Amazon River.Once my work slows down a bit, I will start training in earnest. I look forward to reading all the trail journals from this year's group of hikers.God bless!",,Time for Planning,"Jan 04, Mon",0
