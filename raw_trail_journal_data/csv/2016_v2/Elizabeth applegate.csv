Elizabeth applegate,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/444629,"I've been thinking about the AT since I was a kid. My dad had a copy of Ed Garvey's book, and I'd often thumb through it, dreaming of being out there, free, for such a luxuriously long amount of time. Now that I've reached a point in my life where I'm (almost) free of other commitments, I've taken the step of announcing to friends and family that I WILL be doing this. I've started to save money, research logistics and gear, and walking about 10 miles a day. Step One has begun: Doing Something!",,Making a commitment,"Mar 13, Thu",0
Elizabeth applegate,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/444667,"Why do I think I could successfully do a thru-hike?1) I can tolerate pain for extended amounts of time. For years I've lived with foot pain at work, chronic migraines, and back issues. It's something I've learned to handle and I can manage to keep going about my day- even enjoying it!2) I'm giving myself plenty of time to save funds for the trip, so lack of money for resupplies and comfort stops shouldn't have to drive me off the trail. 3) I genuinely enjoy solitude and don't mind monotony. I'm clearly an introvert, so endless days of hiking appeal to me as a chance for hours upon hours of thinking time. I'm actually considering a southbound hike for this reason.",,Aiming to be the 1 out of 4,"Mar 14, Fri",0
Elizabeth applegate,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/444687,"I asked friends about ideas for a trail name, and a few options came up. The first was Turtle, for my affinity for the animal and my slow, long day approach to hiking. Another was Freedom, a major theme in my life. For years I was ""trapped"" for different reasons (jobs I didn't like, bad relationships, materialism), but lately I've been learning to take back the reins of my own life. That suggestion led to Liberty, which is actually a play on Libby, one of the versions of my name, Elizabeth. It fits perfectly, so Liberty it is. I am free, and soon I will be free on the AT!",,Why Liberty?,"Mar 15, Sat",0
Elizabeth applegate,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/445323,"My hike is still two years away, and to satifsy my curiousity I've been reading a number of books about the Appalachian Trail and other long distance hikes. The following are the most recent:Awol on the Appalachian Trail, by David Miller    So far this is my favorite read. He left his stable job for a grand adventure, much like I'll be doing. Miller does a wonderful job of describing beauty and kinship on the trail, as well as balancing it out with a healthy dose of reality in the form of blisters and mud.Becoming Odyssa, by Jennifer Pharr Davis    Another great read about the A.T. She starts out as a nervous but positive single gal thru-hiking, and ends up confident and ready to tackle the world.Five Million Steps, by Lon Chenowith    My least favorite read about the A.T. so far. While there are moments of trail life that are inspiring, and while he appreciates the blessings of such a beautiful place, the author ends up being too judgemental for my tastes. He tends to lump anyone not like himself into vague groups (""He was a Jew"" or ""She was a Zen Buddhist""), dismiss them, and then go into painful detail about what brand and flavor of noodles he ate that night.Wild, by Cheryl Strayed    This one is about a single woman's long distance hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. She is lost in the world and trying to find some meaning and direction. Throughout her hike description, she also explores her past losses and mistakes, and comes out in the end actually learning to believe in herself.",,Reading while waiting,"Mar 19, Wed",0
