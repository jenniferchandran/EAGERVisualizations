Longstory and Breakaleg ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521963,Ordered my new tent from Zpacks on 2/24/16. I have been advised that Zpacks will be able to get the tent to me just prior to the start of my hike.If the tent arrives with no quality control issues I should be in good shape with a few days to practice my set up.,"

Longstory and Breakaleg ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521965,"As May approaches quickly I'm struck with all the little things that I have to get together prior to my hike.There are the domestic chores that must be caught up and so many other preparations to be make.I feel fortunate to have backpacked for so many years,confident in my skill set and with my choices in gear that have evolved over the years.I've sold off much of my gear that I had collected over the past few years to other backpackers in need of good equipment at a fair price and in return I was able to offset my new tent expense.I'm going to attempt to do something towards the cause every day so that I'm not overwhelmed closer the beginning of my hike.Wish me luck on that.I have forgone my garden this year as I won't be around to tend it, which frees up a lot of time.","
