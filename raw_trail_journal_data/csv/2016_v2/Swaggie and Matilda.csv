Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548507,"After driving up the night before, we set out to drive over to the last section completion point at Crawford Notch and park the car, then shuttle back to the Falling Water trailhead to hike up to the AT where the two trails meet at Little Haystack Mountain. 

I'd forgotten just how steep the Falling Water trail is, this is the trail I walked down back in 2013 with a blocked small intestine, stumbling along like a zombie in great pain, severely dehydrated, barely able to walk. Coming up this same trail now I could scarcely believe that I was able to do it, it's so steep and rocky.


It's a beautiful sweeping vista along the Franconia ridge, above the treeline, with virtually a 360 degree view as you cruise along. We have a quick break and a snack before moving along the narrow ridge line, the highlight will be Mount Lafayette and it appears fairly close, but you can't actually see it and the hike takes much longer than we think.


It's down down to the Mt Garfield campsite, we have to set up on a platform, which presents some issues for a pole-less tent, there's no where to drive stakes into the ground to support the tent, so we have to figure a way to attach it to the wooden platform or on the sides. There's a nice SOBO couple setting up on the next platform and we chat for a minute.","Little Haystack Mountain

Matilda in the Falls


The trail north from the campsite is basically a small stream as the spring runs down the rocks, it's very steep and slippery and I have to inch down, one of those scary New England descents that I'm not used to yet, one slip and yer gone.

It's looks like rain, and in fact its misting a bit, we approach the Galehead hut and decide to stop in for a break and see what happens with the weather. They have yummy ginger muffins and hot chocolate to warm us up, we can water up as well, but as we leave the rain comes down in earnest and we don rain gear and pack covers.

It rains into the afternoon, stopping for a break means getting cold so we gotta keep moving, the faster the better, but the rain makes the trail slippery and caution is advised.

We get to Zealand Falls Hut and decide to check out if there's space for the night, we're cold as we stop and hot meal and a warm bed would definitely be the prescription for the night.


Rainy PM View From the Hut


There's space, happy days, we get some hot water for soup and tea to warm us up, and then head to check out the falls, the rain has eased up but it's still dark and cold, that doesn't mean the falls aren't gorgeous though and we get some photos just in case the weather is worse in the am.

As the temps drop with the sun I'm starting to feel cold, didn't bring enough clothes for the weather in New England, I see someone wrapped in a blanket and think it's a great idea so get a few and wrap myself up, it helps a bit but still shivering.


Trying to Stay Warm at Zealand Falls Hut


Dinner is Beef Stroganoff, it's definitely an AMC version, no sour cream, just a kinda thin sauce, but I like to get some beef and eat as much as possible.

After dinner there's a short educational lecture by the resident geologist who describes how the Zealand Valley was formed by glaciers a mile thick, you can see the U shaped valleys in the distance. He talks about some of the beautiful hikes down in the valley, and I'm wishing we had more time to explore."," Garfield Campsite

Pancakes and bacon for brekkie at the AMC hut, it's a beautiful sunny morning by the falls, which look really spectacular in the early morning light, more like ledges actually, with the water sweeping over the rocks. We bask in the morning sun for a few minutes before heading off for Crawford Notch and more real food.

 The trail goes down steeply for a bit outa the hut then is flat as it winds around the opposite ridge, there's lotsa blueberries along the side and we stop several times to pick, a nice complement to the skimpie breakfast. It's a bit stingy of AMC to charge so much ($110) for a night and not offer a hiker sized breakfast to keep us going for a while.

Matilda Catches a Dip in Ethan Pond

Ethan Pond beckons, I need water and Matilda wants to swim, so we head in for water and a dip, it's warm as we are to discover. like most of the ponds. Then it's just a cruise down to 302 to finish the section, a last bit of a road walk to get to the car.
We drive into Gorham to check into the Top Notch Inn, looks pretty nice and the guy knows the local area well, then to Mr Pizza, one of the few places to eat in Town, not great food but great view of the river with a deck almost on top of it, and good draft beer. It's a buffalo chicken salad for me.","Zealand Falls Hut

Matildas Second Swim of the Hike

We already know this will be a tough day, up Wildcat Ridge from Pinkham Notch, so we need a good brekkie. It's gotta be the White Mountain Cafe, bagels and expresso, great way to start the day, then we head around to Pinkham Notch to the long term parking area, it's almost full and as we walk off, the last few spaces fill up, just in time.


Sunset on the Ridges of Carter Notch

It's typical AMC, the trail outa the parking lot is not marked at all, so we wander around for a bit, lost in a parking lot, OMG, end up by the road and I have to drag out my phone to see if we're on the trail or not, it's not, so we walk by the road for a bit to pick it up, it follows a small stream before heading up to the ridge line. Not bad for a while, it's just a generic AT steep climb, a thru-hiker blows by like he's running up the mountain, then another with audible music from a phone, we hear him from a ways back. It's the rock scramble that this mountain is famous for, it's really scary as you hang over Pinkham Notch, pack swinging on the breeze and the traffic and lodge visible below, if you dare to look down-I don't.It's a V shaped angle in the rocks that you have to wedge yourself in to get through, one slip is all it will take.
There's a chair lift at the top, tourists abound, some day hikers, we coulda put our packs on the chair lift and picked them up at the top.We hear later that some hikers go up with just a snack and water bottle and take the chair lift back down to pick up their packs, why didn't we think of that?
We ramble along for a while, there's an overlook of the notch with a bunch of SOBOs sitting around, they start a pipe and offer us some but we gotta get down to the bottom of the notch so we press on.The descent isn't too bad, just steep, nothing technical, we see some stealth sites trail side but keep going to the hut to check, they tell us of some nice sites behind the hut out of the Forest Protection Area (no camping zone), and we find a nice site.
Back to ??? hut for Matilda to swim and get water, then to the ramparts (a rocky overlook) to watch the sunset over the mountains in the distance.","Pinkham Notch

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549194,"Early AM Light up Carter Dome


It's a steep climb to start the day off, up to Carter Dome with some nice views of the valley below us as we gain altitude. There's a bunch of Carter mountains on this section, middle, south, etc and also Mount Hight, which has tons of berries to snack on and keep us going up all these mountains.


Rest Stop on Mt Hight


It's the Imp Shelter for lunch and a huge aggressive fly arrives to share our meal, a real nuisance it buzzes around and around and really annoys us until I slow it down with a slap from a sweat towel and stomp it when it slows down.

We have trouble finding a campsite for the night, we see some nice spots but they have dodgy looking water supplies, or no water at all, so keep going but getting very tired late in the day, we finally find a so-so spot off to the side of the trail, it's not exactly flat and a bit buggy, there's a nice stream nearby though so it'll have to do, the good news is it shaved some miles off from tomorrow, where we head outa the mountains and into town.

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549822,"Great Swimming Hole in the Rattle River


Easy day, we're ahead of schedule, the trail follows the Rattle River for a while, there a great looking swimming holes dotted in the river as we follow and cross it, the area around the shelter is rumored to have the best though so we wait.

The trail is very easy now, just a gentle grade down, we dump off our packs and head down to the river to check out swimming, it's indeed a great spot, the water rushes over some rocks into a deep pool, it's too cold for me but Matilda jumps right in, I bathe my feet and wash a bit, get some lovely pix of the swimming hole.

We were gonna stay at the White Mountains Hostel just down the road a bit, but as I hike the thought came to me that the next section is one of the most difficult on the AT, Mahoosuc Notch with it's infamous 1 mile boulder scramble, so the brilliant idea is for us to skip it for now and do it together, it's a bit risky alone and it means Matilda can finish New Hampshire, strike another state off the list, so the plan is to drive to Andover and pick up the trail there.


Pine Ellis Hostel, Andover Maine


We head into the hostel to pick up a supply package that was mailed, it looks like a great hostel, very clean and they a wonderful system for doing hiker laundry-you take off your dirty stinky clothes and dump them in a hamper, then they supply clean clothes to wear until the laundry is done, the place is very clean and neat and the staff are all very friendly.


Festival in Andover


We shuttle back to Pinkham Notch and have some lunch, it's still early so we don't need to rush, soup and sandwich, then about an hour and a half to Andover to the Pine Ellis hostel, it's definitely an AT style place, a bit dirty and cluttered, very cheap is the good side, we hear news of prime rib for dinner and head over to the Little Red Hen.

There's a festival going on, just our luck, a band is playing at the commons till late and there are local artisans displaying there wares, with food as well, the prime rib wasn't so great and I'm regretting we just didn't come here to eat. A bottle of Jamieson helps the evening pass.","Stealth Campsite

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549196,"A zero day in Andover, very nice, the festival is going on with a parade, a chicken BBQ at the fire station and a vintage car show, should be fun.

The parade is kinda weird, there are lotsa military vehicles, including a tank with rubber tracks, but also some old restored farm machinery and fire equipment, and last comes a big horse and cart, the driver seems to be having trouble controlling the horses, it looks like at some point they're gonna plow into the crowd until someone grabs one of the lead horses and wheels them around away from the crowd.

The BBQ looks great, it's minus beer though so we decide to get it to go and buy a six pack from the General Store-all these little towns in Maine have a general store, pretty cool. Back to the hostel to sit on the grass and eat our BBQ washed down with some cold beer.

Then it's off the check out the vintage car show, there seems to be lotsa old cars for such a small town, they must be coming from miles around. There are some nice old Chevelles that somehow remind me of Norm Beechey's race car back in Australia in the late 60's, but when I look it up it seems Norm drove an earlier model. He was know as Stormin Normin for his flamboyant driving style, and his contests with Pete Geoghegan in the Mustang have passed into Australian motor racing legend.","US Route 2, Gorham NH

Near the end I bump into a couple and the guy is having some issues, when I tell them we're staying in Rangely that night he decides to bail and catch a ride.

Matilda comes bouncing down the trail as we near the road crossing and, there's a short steep climb up from a stream, at the road there was apparently some trail magic earlier but alls that left is a cooler of cold beer, not bad just the same.

The Town and Lake motel in Rangely is great, there's a beautiful lawn in the back that opens onto a lake, really pretty. For dinner we find a nice restaurant in town, they ask if we have reservations even though the place is empty, later it fills up and we see why.","South Arm Road, Andover

I'm hankering for a steak and we find a hibachi at a general store. It's easy to just assemble one of grills that come with it, and there's a crude BBQ at the motel, we pick up some fast start charcoal and firewood and get a nice fire going, it's a bit late when we eat but tastes great, and we have a warm fire for the evening. The $12 hibachi will go back to DC to be used post hike for grilling steaks, it works better than gas for that.","ME 17 Oquossoc/Rangely

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549824,"Back with a backpack, Matilda drops me off in the morning at the trail head and we say a sad goodbye as she's headed back to DC to continue work.It's a 4 day section so have enough food for that, but 3 days is also a possibility.

First stop is Eddy Pond, a lovely quiet spot, the guide says there's no camping by the lake shore, despite obvious signs of stealth campsites. I sit and listen for a moment, enjoying the silence.

Then there's a climb up Saddleback mountain, a downhill ski area, luckily the ski trails don't spoil the view. The trail opens out above tree line, it's a rocky scramble, not too steep though.

There's a small group of backpackers sitting on rock ledge having a snack, they invite me to join them and I do, it's sunny and outa the wind, very pleasant.

There are blueberries along the trail, getting thicker as we go up, very low bushes to avoid the brutal winter wind. Nearer to the summit there are more berries and crowds of day hikers picking berries, at the same time tramping all over the bushes, tsk tsk, it's an alpine environment and signs encouraging hikers to stay on the trail, lady backpacker admonishes them to stay on the trail.

Then it's up and over the horn and on to Redington Campsite, planned stop for the night, it's only 3 o'clock so decide to continue on to Poplar Ridge, another 2.7 miles, maybe 3 days is possible for this section.

At the Lean to there's already 2 hikers in situ, one sitting by the fire ring and another dead to the world on the shelter floor. It's Tuna Roll, I'll bump into him several more times, he's totally beat, so tired he can't even raise himself up.

More hikers stream in, the couple from Saddleback and 2 more women, Ninja who's doing a vacation section for 3 weeks, a claimed SOBO who doesn't have any fuel left, then she dumps her empty fuel canister out on the ground.

Tuna Roll and the male half of the Saddleback couple are ex-military and they get into a boring discussion over where they've been posted to, yawn. I doze off listening to music and playing Sudoko on the phone.","ME 4, Rangely

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550132,"Get up early, Ninja has almost left, fire ring guy left early. Forgot to clean the granola pouch, ouch, not sure how long since it's been washed and has some old wet granola in it, doesn't smell or look moldy so rinse it out and cook new batch of granola in it.

2.5 miles to Orbetron river, lovely spot to wash up a bit, feels great to be at least a little clean, then just across there's a side stream that's also very nice, get some water, looks like a great camping spot.

I find out later that this is the spot an older hiker disappeared last year, the official story was she want off the trail just a few feet to pee and got disorientated, but a searcher told a different story that fro this spot, instead of following the AT by the stream she turned left and followed a woods road for a while and ended up close to US Navy property about a 1/3 of a mile off the AT, where she set up camp and stayed for a month before passing away. A guard or someone checking the navy fence found her, she was too far off the AT for the searchers.

Trail follows this small stream, it's pretty easy here, a nice break. There's a water source supposedly coming up, getting very hungry so stop by the first one, not quite as big but will have to do, make some hot soup and goes well with Lorissas jerky.

Next up is Mt Abraham side trail, it's 1.7 to summit so decide to skip it and keep going. Next stop the Spaulding Mountain LT, there's a bunch of Quebecois kids there and soon they leave to go to Mt Abraham for the day, there's a nice water source so get some for tea and a snack. Ninja rolls in as I leave, she went up Mt Abraham. 

Thinking about where to stop for the night, there's a steep descent coming up down to the Carabassett River where there might be campsights but don't wanna do the descent at night.

Passing the sugarloaf trail and get confused about water sources, there's one close by and I think it's on the AT, but actually on the side trail so miss out, keep going and a SOBO passes and has info on water and a stealth campsite coming up before the hellish descent. 

There's indeed soon a very small stream with a trickle of water, it has some tadpoles floating around but works anyway, fill up everything and lumber under all that weight for a bit till the stealth campsite comes up, not a great campsite but rest is the most important now, it's the first set up of this tent for a long time in the backcountry. Ninja comes along and asks if I mind if she stay, no worries, some NOBO's go by and don't even notice the site.","Poplar Ridge LT

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552638,"A hiker warned about a steep descent to the Carrabaset river, was feeling a bit, tired and hot and eyes crusty, no where to wash up high. 
Down descent and hear poles clicking and clacking behind me, maybe a thru-hiker but not catching up too quickly, they're usually so fast. It's reading man from Andover, he's a bit whiny and looks dangerous on the descent, wobbles all over the place and almost falls several times, he reports that conductor is back there somewhere too.
The river is a beauty, tons of water and nice and clear and cool, feels great to a hot dusty hiker to splash cold water all over, the road runs right next to the river, we were thinking of using it as a shuttle point earlier, doesn't look too rough.
Up to the Croker campsite looking for the privy, hoping it's not too far off the AT, and it isn't, joyful feelings and relief, didn't have much of an appetite for breakfast, now feeling hungry, so sit down by the trail on a log, get some nice clear cold water from the stream nearby with a squeeze bottle and have brekkie 2, very thirsty as well.
Conductor rolls up just as I get up to leave, it's a very steep tough climb up Croker Mtn, Conductor is too quick for me on the up but stops at the summit to rest and have a snack, not a great spot, no view at all.
It's down a bit through a bit of a saddle and then up the next Croker, a day hiker with a dog is there and reports that the descent isn't too bad, it's only partly true though, it's not steep but rooty and rocky, slow and difficult, starting to feel very tired again but catch up to Conductor anyway and somehow that helps me focus.
Matilda is on her way to meet me at the traihead so texting progress, meanwhile Conductor calls his wife to get permission to stay in Stratton, it's a budget thing apparently, and the weather isn't looking good for the next few days, offer him a ride into town.
The final bit is a drop nuisancy off, Conductor has run ahead a bit and immediatley crossed the road to try and hitch, he seems anxious to get to town, he yells that Matilda may already be there, a car just pulled up, indeed and great timing, sweet embrace and we hang out for a bit catching up, drink a cold OJ to refresh and meanwhile Conductor has already caught a ride.
Short drive into town for a cold beer, the White Wolf is the place for the moment but they don't have salads so it's a lobster roll, Conductor appears after a bit and offers to buy us a beer, it's too late though, we waste no time in getting a cold one.
We're staying at a lodge outa town, it's called Tranquility, right on Flagstaff Lake (how funny that I'm writing this in Flagstaff AZ), beautiful spot, need a shower and clean clothes badly, the owner is a very strange and fussy New England lady, she makes a big fuss about opening the windows with a crank and gets really annoyed when Matilda appears not to be paying sufficient attention.
We head back to the plaza hotel for a salad and more cold beer, back to the room and it's quite warm, no A/C in this part of Maine, that makes me feel hot and tired as well, need a pill to help me sleep.","Stealth Campsite near Sugarloaf

One chore for sure is laundry, Ninja is there too, it's a hikers ritual.
We go in search of the best lobster roll in Stratton, reportedly at the Loose Moose, a cafe just down the road a bit, definitely better than yesterday, have a beer too and then a nap, it's hard to wake up, feeling groggy for a while.
The lake looks inviting even in the rain, which has eased up a bit, so we go to check out Kayak rentals but they don't have hourly rates and it's already late in the day and the rain begins to threaten again. 
Matilda has met another Russian staying at the lodge, his name is Alex of course and he's doing peak bagging in Maine, very friendly guy and pretty tough to boot, hiking up those peaks rain or shine, we bump into him back at the lodge, still hiking up those peaks.
As we get back into town, blue sky appears, bummer, maybe we should a kayaked anyway, oh well, we drive out around the lake instead to check it out, there are some really nice campsites scattered along the road with some RV's parked there.
We drive up a small road towards the lake for a bit, the road ends and we walk towards the lake, there's a nice little beach with picnic table and BBQ, maybe tomorrow when the weather clears up a bit and we have more time.
I need to get my re-supply in order for the next few days on the trail, head to the Stratton Motel to drop supplies and book shuttles, plan is to hike the Bigelows Sunday/Monday, shuttle back Monday PM to Stratton, then shuttle back to East Flagstaff Road early afternoon Tuessday and hike to West Carry Pond LT to meet up with Tuesday group from PATC.
There's a fancy restaurant in Stratton, it's a really small town and doesn't look at all well healed so it's a bit surprising, one of these deals of a big city chef escaping to the countryside to wow the locals and de-stress a bit.
There's no seating in the restaurant itself, folks come from miles around apparently and you need a reservation, there's a pub attached though and we can sit a the bar, so we do just that, it's called the Tiger Lilly pub and they have 2 locally made pate's yum, and chicken fried steak, it's enormous even for hungry hikers and Matilda have a huge Giffords Ice Cream for lucnh, Wild Maine Blueberry flavor of course. 
We manage to polish off the steak anyway and head back to the Plaza Hotel for music and drinks, they play mostly Beatles covers, not very original but they play with lotsa gusto, I order a scotch and soda, it comes in a huge pint beer glass, enough to get a horse drunk.","

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552641,"Early breakfast at the Loose Moose, many hikers there getting ready for a trail start. Didn't eat too much, musta been the nice dinner the night before, so had plenty left over for a lunch on the trail.
Sad goodbye to Matilda at the Maine 27 trailhead, feeling good early on (courtesy of 2 days off) and the first few miles are easy, before the trail goes up into the mountains. It's very wet and humid in the woods after all the rain of the past 2 days, and the mozzies are active.
Trail goes up to a view, an old shelter and 2 peaks can be seen in the distance, then down to a very old (1936) shelter, now for day use, has an earthen floor, not great for sleeping. the site is big with a cute diagram, have the rest of the brekkie sandwich for lunch, and then some soup and peas and nuts.
Rest for a bit but there's a mouse afoot so hard to rest and leave before 1. It's a steep climb up to South Horn, not great right after lunch, then another steep climb to Big West with great views of the lake, very exposed above tree line with high winds on the North side, it's really too windy to sit very long and enjoy the views.
It's a short drop down into the Col and the Avery campsite, the highest on the AT, a very lonely spot partly because the water is a bit scarce, it's still a bit early so take time to scout the site and find the water sources.
They're listed in the guide and there are markers, they are indeed meager, just a trickle into a little rock pool, one is under some rocks and not easy to access, get about half the water I need from that one and then go looking for the next one, it's right on the trail and a bit North, has a cover to keep the animals out I guess, also very little flow, hope no one else needs water cause they won't get much.
There are tent platforms situated all around the campground, it's a steep mountainous place and there's almost no flat ground to set up a tent, so the platforms help, not easy to set up a poleless tent though, gotta attach the ropes to the side of the tent platform somehow, there are some loops but not in the most convenient places.","Maine 27

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552642,"Cold and foggy on the mountain in the am, and just a little bit of rain. The fog is so thick, you can only see about 30', and the wind is blowing hard, blowing the fog around.
Got up early and felt congested and cold and couldn't figure out what to eat for breakfast. It's a steep climb up Avery peak and the howling winds don't make it any easier, hang on to your hat, and the wind catches the pack and pushes it around and threatens to blow the pack cover right off.
It was cold so dressed up a bit, and it's sure to be even more windy and colder up on the peak so try to keep layers on and move slowly so as not to overheat, moving slowly doesn't seem to be a problem on this morning. It starts to rain a bit so stop and put poncho on, it makes the trip even more difficult in the wind as it blows it around. I take the chin strap on my hat and put it under the chest strap on my pack so it doesn't blow away.
Avery peak is completely fogged out, no view at all, and surprisingly not as windy, there's some shelter from the rocks on top, no point in lingering because of the fog.
Down to Safford Col, very slow progress, 2 hours 15 minutes to do 2.3 miles, very careful on the descent, stop for a bite at the bottom, it's sunny now and pleasant, I can see the upcoming ridge ahead, can't linger too long because the bugs are out for a morning feast and I'm on the menu.
The ridge ahead is called Little Big ridge, where do they come up with these names? The Northern end has a great view and there's a peregrine about, it puts on a truly amazing show, swooping and diving right overhead on a quest for it's own breakfast, I sit and watch enthralled, one of the most amazing displays ever on the AT.
A young Canadian from Montreal shows up, not Quebecois, very nice and I tell him about the peregrine, which has now moved on to greener pastures. It's .8 to the other end of the ridge, the peregrine shows up here but the display is not as stunning and the bird is higher so don't get as good a view.
Along the way a SOBO shows up, he started from Katahdin with little knowledge of the AT and didn't bring enough food for the 100 mile wilderness, lost 20 lbs doing it and I can imagine was really painful and maybe even dangerous, he looks really scrawny, he lost muscle and became delirious at some point, it's a wonder he made it at all, true grit.
It's a fairly easy descent off Little Big, lotsa sloping rock faces to walk across, these are nice and pleasant to walk on. Sit on a rock in the sun waiting for the shuttle back to Stratton, it's late and I'm hungry and anxious, a shuttle has never in all my years on the AT not showed up.
A car pulls up to disgorge a hiker, Jincko I think, I don't talk much to him, he seems in a hurry to get moving, pack on and off he goes, I chat with the folks in the car for a bit and they offer me a ride back to Stratton, bit reluctant to ditch the shuttle so quickly even though it's late.
Talk more and it turns out Jincko is from Flagstaff AZ, what a coincidence, he lives just a few blocks from our house there, unfortunately don't get his contact info and I'm writing this from Flagstaff and wondering if I can find him.
Wait 15 more minutes and decide it's enough, we can keep an eye out for the shuttle on the way back, it's clearly marked and the road is dirt and bumpy for the first part so not much traffic and it moves slowly.
Back in Stratton and it turns out the young woman behind the desk who took my shuttle reservation didn't write it in the book, oh well it worked out anyway.
The good news is the hostel now has a BBQ, some guys have gone over the road to Fotters market and got some coals and steaks and beer, I'm definitely in on this, quickly run across and get steak, a big container of salad and dressing, and a six pack of beer, mmm, impromptu party off the AT, how amazing, very enjoyable dinner. We eat and then retire to the living room to watch Bourne on TV, perfect end to the day.","Avery Campsite

I'd noticed some signs posted on the traiheads about the Kennebec ferry, the only safe means for hikers across the Kennebec river coming up soon, which might look inviting to cross on foot. The problem is that huge amounts of water are often released upstream to accommodate the rafting companies downstream, and these can (and do) sweep hikers away, sometimes to their death. Better to stick with the ferry and be safe.
The problem came about because the ferry hours had been further restricted, from 8 am to 3 pm daily, not very convenient for hikers, and the Tuesday group was planning big mileage that day, too much to arrive at the ferry by 3, so had contacted Tom from the group the night before to alert them of the problem.
The other issue was bad weather was returning, though only in the afternoon, we had planned to meet at the West Carry Pond Lean To sometime after noon, it would be only 5 or so miles for me, an easy day, I was gonna sit around in Stratton for a few hours to wait, but given the weather decided to leave early and jump ahead 1 shelter to Pierce Pond, a 16 mile day, ouch.
Breakfast at the General Store, there are some locals sitting around drinking coffee etc, bit of company, didn't see any hikers that morning. Got a lunch sandwich from Fotters and caught the shuttle, quickly bump into the self shuttling trio of Pole Dancer, Rock Hopper and Eeaw, they're a bit slow, particularly Eeaw, older guy who looks a bit stiff. They have 2 cars and hike in opposite directions and swap keys in the middle of that particular section when they meet up. This time they got a ride and so hiked together.
Carry ponds are so named because folks in the old days used to use them for portage, ie carry canoes between them. East Carry Pond has a lovely beach with campsites, be a great place to camp, unfortunately rain is threatening so I push on, moving as quickly as possible hoping to get to Pierce Pond shelter and be able to stay in there for the night, rather than tenting in the rain.
Get to the shelter in less than 8 hours, an easier section of trail and longest backpacking distance so far. Alas all that effort is for nothing, the shelter is packed to the rafters with hikers also trying to avoid the rain, it's still dry so try to find a place to set up the tent, where it's be safe from any wind that might kick up, not easy, all the best places are taken, it seem lotsa folks have high tailed it to this spot because of the rain, no sign of the Tuesday group, expect to be ahead of them.","East Flagstaff Road

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552644,"Very easy day, up at 8:30 for a leisurely breakfast in the shelter, it's nice and sunny but the ground is very wet from all the rain, Maniac comes by and some fisherman trying for the early catch.
There are reports of older hikers on the trail, no sign yet though, the AT follows the stream that feeds the pond for a bit, there are some very pretty ledges in the stream bed, then on to the Kennebec, it's indeed a very big, wide river, and appears not to be too deep, you can see why folks might be tempted to try and cross after ferry hours.
I can see 2 hikers on the other side, too far away to tell who they are, they seem to be setting up camp. The ""ferry"" turns out to be just a simple canoe that holds 3, it's not clear where the landing is and of course I'm in the wrong spot, the ferry comes across and the paddler motions me up river a bit, it's free but ya gotta help paddle and the current is strong even without the release upstream.
Across and it's Steve and Liz there who are trying to dry out all their stuff after the rain from last night, Tom and Carol have taken a bit of a side trip to some falls and are behind but soon show up and it's great to be together, takes a load off.
We head out to the road to wait for the shuttle to Northern Outdoors, then promptly head to the bar for beer and wings, texting to Matilda the good news, check in for a cabin, really just a permanent tent with 2 cots, and get a shower and do laundry.
There had been complaints from some South Bounders about the resupply here and it's indeed meager, it seems they don't really do it anymore, there's a hostel up by the trailhead that has taken over, wish I'd known that in advance, probably a better place to stay and they will shuttle you up and back to the restaurant at Northern Outdoors.
There are some other hikers and rafters sitting around so we chat for a while before heading to the cabin for zzzzs.","Pierce Pond

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552645,"We all get together for breakfast at Northern Outdoors, it's still early and plenty of time for the shuttle back to the trailhead so I decided to try and hitch and can get my resupply while the others catch the shuttle. It's not so easy here, the traffic moves very fast and it's on a bend, I try to position myself so that there's room to stop, nobody does though. Another hitchhiker comes along and confirms it's a tough spot to try and flag somebody down, oh well back to shuttle.
At the trailhead and walk about a quarter mile along the road to the hikers hostel, they're very friendly and there's lotsa hikers there for the night, and they have good resupply, including some of their own stuff, nice.
I try to move along quickly to catch up to the others and come on Steve and Liz fairly quickly stopped for a rest by the side of the trail. We head off and I pass them up the mountain, Steve moves pretty slowly uphill, especially if he has no reason to move quickly.
It's a nice view at the top, the pond is invisible but there is a cell signal. Liz leads the way down while I move cautiously, she appears to be keeping an eye on Steve who looks a little precarious. The campsite by Moxie pond is not great, not really flat or spacious, there are some power lines nearby with open ground as well. I try several spots before deciding on the best of the the not greats. We set up camp and stroll down to the pond for water and to clean up a bit, it's warm and has stuff floating in it to clog filters, yuck, it's drinkable without getting sick is the main thing, miss the spring water further South, cool and crisp and great tasting, you can drink it without filtering.","Caratunk ME US 201

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552646,"In the am, Carol gets up and walks over to the open ground under the power lines and discovers massive amounts of blueberries, yuumm. I take my pot over, they are so thick and grow in clusters so you just need to pull on a cluster and a whole bunch fall into the pot. Enough for a great breakfast of blueberry oatmeal can be had in minutes, what a treat. As we head up the trail there are more berries on the sides, nice snacks during the warm day.
On Moxie Bald for lunch with Steve and Liz, great views in all directions and you can see the pond below where we just came from. There are two groups of women hikers we meet on the way up, Trail Dames and the Rock Hopper group, they've heard about Liz losing her camera via the bush telegraph.
By this time Steve is way ahead of us, chatting takes time. There's a cut off trail past the summit of Moxie that marks 2000 miles on the AT for me, yaaahooo, 189 to go.
It's quick along to the agreed campsite, it's still early in the afternoon, only 3:30, and now find out we need to do 12.6 tomorrow, we stopped too early, bummer.
Bald Mountain stream is lovely, bath in the cool clear water to freshen up a bit, although fresh is really a euphemism on the AT. We sit on the rocks by the stream and watch the fading light by the trees and the water as we eat dinner.","AT mile 2049.6 near Moxie Pond

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552647,"Big mileage day so up early, quick brekkie and off, fairly easy terrain early on, some roots slow progress a bit. A thru-hiker passes who gives info about White House Landing, further down the road. They're initially cheap but the add-ons can really add up, stuff like laundry, soap etc. Liz seems very anxious to talk more to the guy and is almost chasing him up the trail.
It's a very easy section and we catch up to Tom and Carol, even Steve is hurrying along to get to the cabins. We have lunch by a river and have done 9 miles in four and a half hours, not bad at all, and we get to Monson about 1:30, very quick.
Tom showers quickly and we set off in his car, which they conveniently parked here before they started this section, nice. Monson is tiny so we drive up the road to Greenville, a bigger town with a supermarket, outfitters and pubs. We drop off our laundry and then head back to town to shop, Steve shoes have thrown in the towel and there's a store that's a combined supermarket/outfitter, perfect for us as I can shop for resupply while Steve gets his new shoes.
The guys are suddenly in a bit of a panic about the laundry being stolen and I haven't finished yet, as I check out Liz comes running in and says they're leaving, in a rush I leave a bag of groceries on the counter and will have to come back later to shop again.
We go to a pub for dinner, it's a very pleasant evening, not too hot or humid, very comfortable outside apart from the bright sunlight. I get an order of steamed PEI mussels and manage to cut my lip on one of them and bleed all over my glasses, ugh. A nice steak completes the meal. Liz orders a beer but doesn't like it and sends it back.
Back at the 100 mile wilderness cabins and the owner, Phil, is a bit weird. I hadn't made a reservation but he said a cabin was available and he wouldn't charge me for the double since there was only one of me. However he suddenly announces that there's another couple coming that he forgot about and they have the cabin, so I have to sleep on the floor of the community room, not great the door can't be closed and a very friendly dog will keep coming in to play.
There's a brother/sister or cousins couple who are thru-hiking here, had met them at Northern Outdoors earlier, they had a pizza for dinner and didn't eat it all, so left a few slices in the kitchen, which I helped myself too with a beer for a late supper, but Phil goes ballistic over it, there's a thief in my cabins etc, I don't say anything, he's just too weird.","Bald Mtn Stream, AT mile 2058.7

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552648,"Not feeling so hot this morning, not sure why, we drive into town to eat breakfast at Pete, looking forward to Blackberry French Toast but they're out so get a nice piece of baked ham instead.
Kinda boring start of the trail to the infamous 100 mile wilderness, a part of the trail in Maine where there are no towns close and limited resupply opportunities. The situation has improved in recent years, partly because there's now an AMC lodge parked in the middle which accepts resupply packages if you stay there-OK for us, not great for thru-hikers since they charge about $120 a night.
We get to our first road crossing, Maine 15, and there's a bunch of emergency vehicles there, a hiker has been injured just up the trail and they send a team in to carry her out, no one knows how bad or what injuries she has.
We pass them carrying her strapped into a gurney, she doesn't look too bad, apparently an ankle, her boyfriend is there and says ""Enjoy Katahdin"".
Rain is in the forecast for the evening so I run ahead of the group to try and make the next shelter, it's not forecast to be so bad though and end up not making it.
The AT routes past a beautiful waterfall and stream crossing, there are some swimmers there enjoying the cool clear water that dances across the rocks, 2 of them see me and ask some questions about the AT. Tom and Carol and behind and Carol misses the stream crosses, gets turned around and is almost headed back South on the AT.
It's a long and difficult afternoon, we end up by a another beautiful stream that looks like it could be tricky to cross, it's deep and fast running and with the rain might get more difficult, the campsite we find is great, nice and flat and right by the river. We get our first campfire going too.
2 hikers stop by our camp, they're young and lean and look hungry, Superman and Stowaway, Superman just up and decided to hike the trail North from where ever he was, somewhere in Georgia or Tennessee I think, and picked up his mate along the way somewhere, they're probably a gay couple who the trail has thrown together. They're very lively conversationalists and tell us some stories of their travels, think they were trying to quietly ask us for food without actually doing so, I remember later that I had some I could have given them. They like to camp on the mountain tops so they can watch Netflix, and carry a bunch of spare cell phone batteries to keep the movies going.","Monson, ME

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552649,"It's raining as we pack up to leave, still raining as we head off, then it stops quickly. We gotta get across Thompson Brook, it's running quite well and looks precarious to cross, it'll be a day of water crossings.
It turns out there'll be three more, the second one is the most difficult, the water is rushing down stream to a river across some rocks and the actual AT crossing looks undoable, so we go upstream to find a place where the water is not so swift and inch across. I'm ""Malcolm in the middle"", wait for Liz and Steve to cross but Tom and Carol zoom off, bit worried that all get across safely. 
The third crossing has a rope to guide hikers across, not so difficult but gotta hang on to secure yourself. I wait again for the others while Tom and Carol zoom off.
Now we gotta climb up Barren Mountain, there are ledges on the way up and it's very steep and chilly, with gusty winds, on top is a tower and the winds are really howling, they grab the pack and push you sideways, we don't stop long on top, it's too cold and windy, just a quick snapshot.
The side trail to Cloud Pond is a real doozy, rocky and gnarly with some huge roots sticking out that have drops so big you have to butt slide to get down them, saving aging knees from the shock.
The campsite is really nice, we spots right by the pond, not really flat but great view of the pretty pond. The wind is still blowing and it's very chilly, it's relatively high for this part of the country and the cold weather has definitely moved in, even in mid-summer.
I'm shivering as we unpack and get ready for dinner, need to drag out all my layers and bundle up, quick to filter some water from the pond to make tea and then dinner to help stay warm, didn't bring enough clothes fro this weather. The trail lore is that most people get hypothermia in summer. We eat quickly and crawl into sleeping bags to get toasty, it's the first time I've really gotten into my bag on the trip, zipped all the way up.","Thompson Brook

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552650,"Casual day, not so many miles so get up late and have a huge breakfast to replenish all those miles yesterday. We're into the Chairbacks, one of only 2 mountain ranges in the 100 mile wilderness, and these babies are not like New Hampshire or Southern Maine, much more tame.
Despite this, crossing a bog I manage to fall off a boardwalk into the fragile landscape, it's truly a bog, very muddy and before I can extract myself I go ankle deep into the mud. Feeling kinda embarrassed about this stupid fall, just turned around to look at something and got off balance, glad no one was around to see it. There's a sign at the beginning asking hikers to please stay on the boardwalk, oh well I tried.
Feet get wet again as up the mountain I go, so stop at the ledges on the summit to dry off and rest, it's nice in the sun and these ledges make nice chairbacks, is this why the mountains are called the Chairbacks?? 
Starting to feet tired now, luckily it's only .6 miles to the campsite at West Chairback Pond and it's another beauty, right on the pond and there are canoes to use, most of these ponds have them, some are chained up by the owners while others look like they're available for use, so Tom and Carol avail themselves of the opportunity and go for a short paddle out on the pond.
It's hot soup and a snack for me with freshly filtered pond water, we get a campfire going to finish off the day.","Cloud Pond LT

It's a mad dash to the privy, not too far luckily but someone just beats me to it, bummer, then sweet relief.
Then it's up another of the Chairback peaks, get on top and take a rest and Tom and Carol show up, seems a bit odd to be in front of them, short and very steep descent off the peak, Tom and Carol go off trail again, then we bump along for a while till the final descent to Katahdin Iron Works Road, we miss the side trail that goes to the lodge and have to back track a bit, it looks like a fairly remote spot, just a dusty gravel road with little traffic.
Not an easy trail to the lodge, it goes up and down a bit and is not short, about a mile, they do have beer and wine however, yeehaaa. First thing is a shower, keep all my clothes on to wash them at the same time then out to dry by the cabin where we're lodged. The beer puts me to sleep on a sofa in the lodge, wake up and go in search of my supply box, previously mailed, I'm a bit nervous that it has arrived but no worries, it's there and have way too much, about 10 lbs, goodness what was I thinking.
Most places have a hiker box where you can donate over supplies to hungry and poor hikers, nothing here so I create one with my supply box, bum a marker pen and write ""HIKER BOX"" in huge letters and put it in a conspicuous location hoping some one will notice, and AMC won't throw it out. They cater to more casual hikers with money who don't need no stinking extra supplies.
Up after short nap and some repacking we decide to grab some canoes and head out on the Pond, it's beautiful of course and we spend about an hour paddling around to revive appetites for dinner.
Dinner is pasta with sausage and wine, there's a vegetarian option too of course, we're sitting with some other hikers and one is from California on the same schedule we are.
Most of the people in AMC lodges are not really serious long distance hikers, they came out for a bit but want comfort. There's a fire pit down by the pond and some families have got a fire going, it's cool in the Maine woods in the evening, cool enough for a fire so I join them with my flask of whiskey and keep the fire going after they leave, watching the sun set over the golden pond.","West Chairback Pond

The highlight of the day will be the Gulf Haggis Trail, off to the side of the AT, it's a relatively short trail that follows a stream with a bunch of overlooks of waterfalls etc. First we need to ford the West Branch of the Pleasant River though, not too bad compared to what we've already forded.
The closest to the trail is the Screw Auger falls, only a few yards off the AT, we check that out but the others don't want to see the rest, so Liz and I go to check out The Jaws, it's supposedly a mile and a half off which adds 3 miles to the days total, we got for maybe a mile a get a nice view of the stream and decide to turn around.
There are a three hikers from the AT also doing the trail and checking out the views, looks like they might be gonna fish, they look very poor and a bit hungry so reluctant to dump packs and just walk to the first falls, we'll see them again later. Recycle also shows up to check things out.
It's a slow climb for a while, there's a Lean To along the way that's a good place to stop for a bite to eat and a water refill, then a steep climb up Gulf Hagas Mountain and down to the the Sydney Tappan Campsite, goal for the day. It's a nice spot to set up camp but there's a weird looking guy hanging around and it freaks Carol and Liz a bit, got that ""could be an axe murderer"" look, he eventually takes off up the trail and we don't see him again.
The three guys we say at Gulf Hagas show up to camp as well, not far from us, they get a campfire going to go over to check it out and warm up a bit, turns out they fished for trout and caught a bunch, all small and big enough to eat, they cooking them over the fire with English Muffins, living off the fat of the land so to speak, like trail gypsies. They're from Tennessee, didn't do the whole trail, just wandering up seeing how far they get. They have a huge bag of weed and one is getting quite high from it.
Never do well off AMC food, my tummy is a bit runny and need to dash off to the privy for relief. I'm also a bit chafed between the thighs, not space down there and for some strange reason didn't wash undies at the lodge, they're salt infested and scratchy, once this starts and the skin gets irritated it's very hard to control, use some Gold Bond Medicated and sleep naked to try and get some relief, it's a warm muggy night in the Maine woods and my bag is not a summer bag so sweating at night is on the order of the day.

On goes the Gold Bond and off come the undies and it works well, I use a tissue to dry off the sweat when it gets bad, and open the fly to get some ventilation into the right spot. 
It's up 2 mountains before the final White Cap with Liz Tom and Carol on the summit, it's foggy and misty, can't see much but stay for 30 minutes and have a snack, there's also a decent cell signal for checking messages, email etc in the swirling clouds.
Down off the summit for nine tenths and we get our first view of Katahdin way off in the distance, it's a long way off and not 100% sure that's it, sure looks like it though.
The three of us head to the next shelter for lunch. There's a nice stream to filter some water for hot soup on a cool day, goes well with dried peas, I offer some to Liz to try and she tastes one and then gives then to Steve, not impressed at all. 
It's a slow dreary afternoon, feel a bit tired, I can't catch up to Steve or Liz and need to stop at the next Privy for relief, it's only been 5 miles but this helps perk me up a bit.
Pleasant River comes up, I'm alone so stop and wash undies in the stream, not as good as hot water and soap but might help a bit with the chafing, and they'll dry pretty quick in the northern woods.
Phil from the 100 mile wilderness cabins has given Carol a list of good places to camp, this one is by Mountain View Pond and it IS nice, go down to the water to wash well, socks especially, being clean is a nice feeling. It's a huge Pad Thai packet for dinner, we usually share these between the 2 of us, a big meal for one. I walk away from the campsite as the sun goes down to smoke a cigar for a bit.
I wake in the night to the sound of small feet scurrying about, can't tell if it's inside the tent or not, finally have to turn on my light and the damn mouse is in the tent, don't know how he got in but open the door and chase him away. He comes right back of course, so chase him out again and try to find a hole, can't see it but he's back quickly, and now I see why, there's a chocolate/cherry ball rolling around on the floor, musta got out somewhere, I throw it and the mouse out by the tail and find the hole and put some tape over it, these damn critters are more annoying than bears.","Sydney Tappan Campsite

Someone announces that a US congressman is on the trail, Don Beyer from Northern Virginia, he's also known for owning a Volvo dealership, didn't even realize he as a congressman.He hasn't arrived yet, just the advance party carrying large packs, they tell a story of his nephew breaking his ankle on the side trail to Cloud Pond, the chilly spot where we were just a few days ago. He has a satellite phone and calls for help and the military responds and sends in a Blackhawk chopper to ferry the kid out. Turns out his ankle wasn't broken at all, just twisted on the gnarly side trail with some hefty drops due to huge root complexes blocking it.It costs a lot more to send in this military chopper, about 10 times the cost of a normal air ambulance, when I begin to question this one of the group pipes up ""oh that's just a red herring"" and keeps this up, really annoying. When Beyer does arrive he's only carrying a day pack, turns out that most of his gear is carried by others in the group, and to add insult to injury, they only spend a day or two in the backcountry. Beyer has hired a shuttle to pick them up whenever convenient and take them to the nearest town for the evening for a hot shower and a cold beer, not exactly roughing it. We come upon the shuttle later in the day parked by a bridge on dusty Jo-Mary Maine back road, you can get shuttled even out here in the Maine wilderness if you're willing to pay enough. They do bring in supplies for some hungry hikers though, who look very relieved to get their food bags refilled, no fun out here without supplies.Nice privy stop in the PM, no more cramping from AMC food from a few days ago, this is real relief. The chafing gets worse however, have to take undies off and open the fly again for more flow through ventilation.We stop at Kakajdo Road and there are big plastic buckets there, wonder what they're for and what they're doing there, it turns out it's more resupply for hikers, it turns out to be a good way to get supplies in, a shuttle service brings them in and leaves them trailside in this big buckets, to strong for critters to open and not many bears in these woods. The hikers open the buckets and get their re-supply, then the shuttle service picks them up when convenient, nice.It's been a very easy day, the pond is nice but the campsite is not so great, kinda knew we shouldn't entirely trust Phil, there's nowhere flat and it's a bit buggy.

First job is to wash clothes and shower, manage to bum some beers from another guest at the hostel sitting on the porch off a cabin with a cooler, chores done it's time for a quick nap before dinner, I'm in a cottage with 4 bedrooms, there's no one else there, the guys decided to stay in the bunk house, this is much more comfy.
Dinner starts with a nice tomato and cucumber salad, looks like could be home grown, then a huge pizza, can only eat half, we shoulda split them, also a bottle of Yellow Tail, not the worlds best wine but tastes good out here in the Maine wilderness. My pants have split in the back from all the sliding on rocks etc, and Carol graciously agrees to sow them up, I'm not too upset by the whole thing, the hole provides some additional cooling for chafed thighs.
Beginning to feel some emotion now, so close to the end of the trail, even though it's not the end for me, still get some sections in the middle to complete with Matilda. It's too early to go to sleep so stay up reading Katahdin Visitors guide and the x-country skiing opportunities in the park, the lights in the cottage are gas lit, too dark to read without eye strain so gotta use my head lamp, stay even later with some book by an author named Lowell, Time to Die.","Cooper Pond

Quick goodbyes to the gang from PATC Tuesday group that I've hike with for 175 miles, can't find Steve right away he's gone to the toilet. Going along the road for a bit then into the park, it's a flat and easy trail for a bit, nice change, goes by a lovely pond with some cottages dotting the edges and huckleberry bushes along the trail.

It can't last long of course, being the AT, there's a difficult stream crossing, very tricky, go upstream a bit to look for a place to cross, really don't wanna fall into the water this late in the game, a light pack helps but have no poles for stability so grab and cupla sticks from the woods and inch across on the slippery rocks.

Run into rock hopper coming in the opposite direction, also about to finish up, hugs and congratulations all round, been nice to see them on the trail and chat for a bit.

Another stream crossing and sweetie is waiting on the other side, yeehaa, Katahdin was no big deal and she's done already, there are 2 beautiful waterfalls, the Niagaras, not very high but lotsa water coming over, foot is feeling better too.

We roll quickly into Katahdin Stream Campground and get pictures by the sign pointing up the mountain that I remember from years ago when I came here to climb up the mountain, the picture is pointing to the other side of the sign though to mark the different point that I'm at on the trail. I never dreamed of this moment back in 2005. I take a picture of the sign commemorating the dedication of the park.

It's off Bethel for us, it's a bit of a drive, the park is really beautiful even from the road, notwithstanding some dusty trees-no sealed roads in Baxter. We make a quick stop in Millinocket, the closest town to the AT Northern Terminus, for gas a some snacks, the AT appetite kicks in pretty quickly, phone calls to arrange for a shuttle etc.

Long drive to Bethel, ya gotta go way outa the way onto I-95 to get there, no direct route, it's worth it though, the town is really cute and the B&B is really nice too, we need to re-pack, arrange for laundry, then off to Suds (pub)for Bison Burger and beer, very nice, then back to room to watch Trump's fascist speech on the undocumented.","Abol Bridge Campground

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552659,"Nice brekkie at the hotel in Bethel, blueberry pancakes, a bit light and some eggs would have been a great addition. We drive the car to the ending point for this section, Grafton Notch and wait for the shuttle.

The mountains above the notch are in the clouds and look really spectacular. We ask the shuttle driver to take us .2 miles along the road to an intersection, still on the AT, which leaves me an easy .2 at the end to finish, rather than finishing the trail on an anonymous road crossing in the middle of nowhere. Matilda decides she wants to do that .2 after all and runs down and back.

A bunch of cyclists have gathered at the intersection, getting ready to ride to Andover, an AT trail town, they go to the General Store in the middle of town for lunch before riding back.

We see a guy herding along a bunch of huskies on the road that also serves as the AT for a bit and stop to chat, he's an Aussie from Perth come to experience a real winter in New Hampshire and practice his skill.

Up the mountain we go, it doesn't seem too difficult and we make good time, we stop at a nice view point to eat Cesar Roll, ham/turkey with maple syrup works well, it begins to look like water might be a bit of a problem.

We get to our planned campsite turn off trail around 2:30, making good time and too early to stop so we push on to Page Pond, looks good to but still only 3:30 so push on again, it's 1.7 to Dream Lake and a more difficult and tiring section, still we get there around 5, find nice campsite on the lake, sweetie swims to cool off, get some firewood and make a nice fire and watch the sunset over the lake, the stars come out and it's and beautiful evening.","US 2, Gorham NH

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552660,"Very foggy morning, lake is completely covered, no privy at Dream Lake so we head off to the Lean To at Gentian Pond to use the privy there, there's a stupid AMC map of the Lean To locale on the front but is a bit confusing as usual, so manage to head off down the wrong trail and go for a bit before realizing there's no damn Privy, have to look up Guthook to figure out where the Privy is.

Then there's a series of short steep ups and downs, tiring, we have lunch on one of them late, our aim was to reach Carlo Col Lean To for the night but we hear rumors of water further down the trail and decide to keep going, up then down to an unnamed Col with a nice water source, supposed to be a stealth site up the other side, a brutal rock scramble just before the shelter, maybe a Mahoosuc Notch warm up? 

Tough hump up with 3 liters of water for dinner etc, 2 power bars help, nice site if a bit cramped, just off the trail side, we have 2 seperate dinners for once. The sun finally breaks out, bunch of hikers at NH-ME line around the signpost, more come up the hill as we set up camp, including 3 thru-hikers that we passed earlier. 

It's chilly on the mountain, we rug up with everything we have and are still a bit cold, only 33.5 miles left, yeeehaaa.","Dream Lake

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552661,"Cold and foggy in the morning as the trail goes up towards the gooses, and difficult climb, we get to Goose Eye Shelter for lunch and a privy stop, then slow down to what is reported to be most difficult mile on the AT-Mahoosuc Notch, a 1 mile boulder scramble, we've done these before however and not too worried.

As we thought, the infamous notch is not bad at all, kinda fun really, it's pretty and green with the stream running through it, a bit slippery in places. I have to take my pack off twice to squeeze through some of the boulders, Elena gets through with pack on. A big group comes through, gotta wait at one of the narrow spaces for about 15 minutes for them to clear through. We come upon a nice opening in the stream and the water is lovely and cool and fresh for hot hikers.

It takes us 75 minutes to clear the boulder scramble and one and a half hours to the camp site just beyond the boulders, there are some overnighters cooking burgers on a grill, and they have camp chairs, it's tempting to stay but we decide to push onto Speck, down to the creek for water and sit for a snack, long uphill coming and it's already a bit late in the day.

The mountain is steep for sure but feel relatively strong and it goes fairly easy, 1700' in 1.5 miles up to Mahoosuc arm, not too shabby. Mostly easy down to Speck pond and the Lean To, we get there around 6:15, longer day, the place is packed to the gills with college kids out on some orienteering adventure for extra credit, apparently 2 groups were headed in opposite directions and met right at this spot.

I'm pissed off, it's gonna be a difficult dinner prep, no where to cook, we have to improvise, not easy when you're tired, we decide to eat dinner by the pond to get away for the crowd-it's that bad that you to line up for the water source. The Lean To turns out not so bad, no mice and no loud snorers.","Stealth Campsite AT mile 1909

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552662,"Only 4.6 today, it IS 600' up to Old Speck Mountain though, and it's a tough climb to a very scary rock scramble near the summit, clinging desperately to small cracks in the rocks, crawling up the rocks and trying not to slip.

There's a cut off trail at the top, the AT goes left down the mountain, lotsa day hikers who use the AT to do a loop hike. It's steep down at first then levels off, very pretty and an easy treadway on hard mossy rock with a worn path through the moss.

Many day hikers coming up to admire the view, some large groups that could be meetups or some such. Elena begins to tire, maybe has some UTI so pops and Advil. We hear of trail magic in the parking lot below so that gets us going again, plus beatiful stream and ledges, it gets a bit steeper towards the end, then finally flattens out towards the parking lot.

There is indeed great trail magic in the parking lot, 2 former thru-hikers, the guy has a T-shirt from the Doyle Hotel in PA, he tells stories of the trail as we chow down on BBQ chicken, corn and Gatorade, no beer alas.

We make up for the lack of beer at trail magic by heading to the Sandy River Brewery for some drafts and snacks before dinner. We'd heard that there was a good steak house nearby, the Black Diamond, it's a bit disappointing however, and we have some cheese apres steak that makes me a bit nauseous. 

2 hikers that we met on the trail the day before are there too, we saw them at the start and during Mahoosuc Notch, a husband and wife, she was hiking the whole trail and he joined her for a short section, and not the easiest at that.","Speck Pond LT

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552664,"Long climb up the Pates, slow and steady, the first one is nothing special, second is nice but fogged out, and hiker ahead disappears into the fog, very mysterious. There's a hiker carrying a fishing pole, been catching fish all over, eating his way up the trail and living off it.

Call for the mountain top for a shuttle for 5pm, easy downhill to falls down a steep gorge to Dunn Ledges, very pretty spot, not much water but series of falls down the gorge.

The shuttle is 30 minutes late, then a quick shower and off to the general store, there's heaps of cars parked around the Town Hall, apparently a meeting, Nestle is trying to grab the clean Maine water, there's a sign that says ""Nestle/Poland Spring to Steal Ground Water"", yikes folks feel strongly about this, I get the word from someone in the General Store, as well as a six pack of beer of course.

It's not legal to drink beer outside, but the cashier says there are no cops in Andover and the county police rarely visit, so sitting outside to drink should be fine, don't have an opener however, so a local coming out volunteers to drive home and pick one up for me, how nice is that.","Grafton Notch

Swaggie and Matilda,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552665,"It's a very early start-not my choice, the shuttle leaves for the trailhead at 7am, so up at 5:30 to nip off the General Store for a brekkie sandwich, yoghurt, cereal, and coffee on the front porch.

The mountains look very foggy early on, make a quick stop early on for water and hiker from the UK passes by, it's up and down and a long haul to the shelter for lunch, stumbling and banging down the trail, never feel good outa Andover for some reason.

An older hiker from McLean comes in and we talk about knees and steep downhills and Sawyer Notch which is coming up, could be a steep downhill for older knees. It turns out to be not too bad though.

We move about the same speed down the hill until he stops for water-it was a dry shelter, the water source was South on the AT and he didn't wanna go back. There's a nice campground at the bottom of the notch, very flat, lotsa spaces and good water, with a picnic bench no less, mmm. There are also some very aggressive chipmunks flying around the place, trying to grab food.

It's a very steep uphill, tried to rest in the notch but didn't help much, feeling tired in the afternoon and take it slow, rest a lot, it's a walk-rest-walk routine until it starts to flatten out a bit, a day hiker with 2 dogs gives an encouraging word that the top is close, there's no view right at the summit of Moody Mountain, just a big ol pine tree, there is good cell signal to call Pine Ellis and give them a pick up time, about an hour to the trailhead.

It's an easy downhill, catch up to a Momma and daughter and they ask if I wanna pass, not today just taking it easy and don't wanna be pressured to a certain pace.

There's a stream with some nice stealth sites at the bottom, a bunch of hikers waiting to be picked up, it's virtually done for me-last real piece of the AT, just a quarter mile to go on the asphalt, feel releived but not in a celebratory mood just yet, it's last few moments on the ""real"" trail.

The shuttle arrives, it's driven by a pastor who goes off into a rave about why he's here and how to relate religion to hikers, extremely boring and tedious, he brings up WWII and the USSR but gets quickly corrected by yours truly, so he goes into a rant about Stalin's brutality.

Back to Pine Ellis, straight to the general store for champers and fried snacks, fish, chicken, poppers, champers into the freezer whilst in the shower, then emerging to celebrate but there's nobody around, just a young thru-hiker and an older Floridian, they'll have to do, gulping champers and tearing up the goodies.

Sit with the Floridian for a bit and sip more champers, smoke a pipe later, really knocked out, off to bed early and sleep like a log.","East B-Hill Road, Andover

Check into the hostel and catch the lunch shuttle into Gorham, to Mr Pizza for fish by the river, buy some wine and souvenirs for the guys.

Take a short nap after lunch and watch Skyfall on TV with a group of hikers, they like to really chill on a day off from the trail, just lounge around and watch TV, nice.

Not sure when to go and finish the last quarter mile of trail, decide to wait till after dinner, there's a dinner shuttle to Walmart at 6 so get 12 pack of beer, sausages and hot dogs for a BBQ celebration, but the shuttle is late leaving, and then Overeasy gets stuck at the checkout so we don't leave till 7:15, then the guys want to stop for whoppers so we do, it's getting dark already and we get back at 7:35.

Marnie (hostel owner) offers to drive me up to the trailhead so I can do the little section, jog back and stop for a quick selfie by the hostel sign, then inside for champagne toast, BBQ sausages and beer, not a huge amount of food is consumed though because lotsa pizza is being eaten, but I'm finished the trail after at least 10 years and it's a great feeling.",,"White Mountains Hostel, Gorham NH","Sep 08, Thu",0.25
