Startup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476879,"My wife Emily and I are newlyweds and have been going to ""proactive"" couples counseling since a few month before our wedding this past June. We think that it is helpful to have a neutral place that we can talk about our relationship and get an outsiders opinion as to what we can do to be more successful in our lives. Tonight during our session I was able to convey to her as to why I would like to thu-hike the AT. I explained to her that I have lived a certain life for the first 37 years of my life and that I think I would like to live the next 50 differently. I could accomplish this by gradually changing things in my life and maybe, 10 years from now I may be where I want to be. Or, I can take a break, walk int he woods and see if I can find out who I really am. She worries that when I am done, and I come home having accomplished making it from GA to ME that I will no longer see her as what I want in life. I don't feel like I am the ""best"" version of me. Will I find that person on the AT? I don't know, maybe. I want her and my son and the word to see the best version of me. I want to know the best version of me. Right now the AT is just a dream. A walk in the woods that I want to take someday.",,View Entry,"Oct 21, Tue",0
Startup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476972,"Emily and I really haven't sat down and discussed the logistics of my thru-hike. She knows I want to do it ""someday"" but we haven't really talked about when that someday will be. I would stand on Springer Mt. next March (2015) if I thought I could prepare myself mentally, physically and financially before then. I know that is not feasible so in my mind I have it penciled in for March (or April) of 2016.In my opening journal entry I mentioned that we are newlyweds and we would both like to have children soon. I'm in my late 30s and her in her early. It is her dream to have a baby and, although I have a son from a previous marriage, I am also excited to have a little one running around. I feel that me wanting to do this hike, for very personal reasons, is selfish. I would be asking my new wife to either put off starting a family until after the hike, or risk me leaving her at home with an infant so I can go play in the woods for 6 months. I don't want to put this hike on the back burner because we all know that there are seven days in a week and Someday isn't one of them.",,View Entry,"Oct 23, Thu",0

Startup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477522,"My wife and I both work for the State of New York. We make OK money together, but separate it would be a huge burden to have to cover the living expenses for our family. The only way I will be able to make this hike happen is if I am able to save money for gear, the hike itself as well as money to mover lost wages while I am out there.With that in mind I have an interview today for a part time job at Dicks Sporting Goods. I figure I cam make some extra $$ and use the employee discount to buy some gear. Also, I kind of miss the interaction with the public that comes with working in retail. What I am not looking forward to is working nights, weekends and holidays again. But, I am determined to do what I have to go to make this hike happen.",,View Entry,"Oct 29, Wed",0
Startup,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535110,"Well, It is almost June of 2016 and I am no closer to my dream of completing a thru hike of the AT than I was back on October of 2014. I now have a 7 month old son which is part of the reason this adventure was put on hold. The other reason is the laziness I had that allowed me to gain about 60lbs since we last spoke.I am busy remedying the weight issue and have plans to get out in the woods more often, learning about camping and backpacking in preparation for fulfilling my thru hike dream someday.I know it will happen, it's just a matter of when someday will be.",,View Entry,"May 26, Thu",0
