CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518250,"Thru hike prep has been underway for quite a while. Drop boxes are ready, stuff going into storage, and bills are paid. It is amazing the logistics that have to take place. It is different this time from my last thru in 2010. Pretty soon it will be goodbye CT and hello Georgia. The plan (and we all know how well plans work out) is to start in 3 months-ish.That's all for now.","

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520910,"I'm down in Georgia. The training has been going well. My backpack has been packed and ready. The most important thing for me is to get my body ready. I am 6 yrs older than I was the last time I thru hiked. I am in better shape now than I was the last time. My biggest problem is I know what to expect and that's getting in my head. All of that aside, I am super excited and may I say stubborn enough that I am doing this again.I read an article recently that said one of the main things you need to complete a thru hike is being stubborn......check. hahaWeather permitting I will be leaving for this awesome adventure the first week in March.Stay tuned.","

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522194,"So, the plan is to leave a week from Thursday. Eventhough, I know the only way to really prepare for this hike is to hit the trail, I have been doing my best to workout and hike 5 days a week.I'm obsessing over what is going in the pack...again...still. I don't have an official weight yet. I will post it soon. My last hike my pack weight was on the heavy end at around 40-45 lbs. I know ultralighters will cringe. I have made gear changes and will be sharing some of the items with Sky Hi. I feel sooooo excited!!!!!I can't wait to see familiar faces along the way. I know I will have some amazing trail angel support. Did I mention I'm excited? Can't sleep well about the last week. I want to take a moment and thank my family and friends who are making this possible. It's not easy to take time out and conquer a dream like this.Indeed, it takes a village. Mom and Dad I promise to be careful and if I'm not feeling well I'll get off trail. Orlando's,Cindy and JD,Lynnea,Turtle and Sky Hi's family thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you have done and will be doing. Also, a special thank you to The Laporta's and Joanne for taking care of my four legged baby, Stella. For my Anytime Fitness family keep a look out for the map at the gym. Lynnea and Axel will be posting my location.Until next timeCS","

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523043,"Well we are ready and excited to head out. Leaving tomorrow to go to Amicalola Falls and sign in in the official register book. Of course taking all ""start"" pictures. We are not doing the approach trail. Probably drive up forest rd to the parking lot. Turtle is going to hang out with us for the night. Then she'll head back to regular life and we will head out on our epic adventure. Official start date Friday March 10th, 2016.My pack is fully loaded and 31 lbs. This is good news for me, as that is 14 lbs lighter than the last time I hiked. SkyHi's pack is about the same, which makes his 22 lbs lighter than the last time he hiked.Am I ready to eat 6 months worth of Ramen? nope. I am excited about my hiker hunger and to be able to eat whole menus worth of food at a time. I have been enjoying all of my ""lasts"" for a while......last night in a bed, for example. Stay tuned","

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524007,"We left Turtles and got to Neel Gap by 1230pm. Needed to drop our first food box off. I ran into a couple hikers that I know. Rookie was finishing up a southbound and With Cooper is north bounding again. After we chatted with folks we drove on to Amicalola Falls. We took pictures and signed the official thruhiker register. We made our way up Springer Mountain to the parking lot. Turtle, SkyHi and I took pictures at the summit and headed to the shelter for the night. Its always fun meeting new hikers. Tomorrow let the hiking begin.","

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524010,"We left Springer Mountain Shelter to the parking lot. We said our goodbyes to Turtle. I was so sad and wished she could hike out with us.The weather was amazing...sunny and around 70.I am surprised at how well I remember the trail. Its beautiful out here. The Georgia trail maintainers do a great job. My body feels strong and I'm glad I prepared the way I did. SkyHi and I stopped at Long Creek Falls for lunch.I hiked by myself most of the day which I prefer.As an aside, even though we have both thruhiked, we haven't hiked together.Living in these conditions can be challenging, when hiking alone. Hiking with a SO is going to be interesting.Before I made it to the shelter, I looked for SkyHi at a new camping spot. It was an additional mile in total. Ugh. Only to find out he wasn't there.There is a Ridgerunner in the area named Moondog. Great guy and provided some new info. For example, the trail is super busy this year, already. And also, the Noro Virus is already floating around. We will have to be extra careful and vigilant so we don't get sick. That isn't something you want go be in the woods with.","

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524424,"I woke up to a beautiful sunrise this morning.One of the amazing things about thru hiking, is every day breakfast, lunch, and dinner is in a different place. You could be in a rhodedendron patch, overlooking a vista, etc. We broke camp and headed out for a 9.2 mile day to catch up with Miss Janet in Gooch Gap. There were many. many PUDS (pointless ups and downs) and false peaks. All of that and we were done hiking by 245pm. I feel like tomorrow could be painful lol.When we got to Gooch Gap there was a guy in a pick-up doing trail magic. He had sodas and chips and cookies. After a long day it was like...well...amazing!! Having these treats handed to you by someone willing to give of themselves (timewise and money) is the best feeling.We set up our tent and got settled. There was a nice gentleman that joined us for the night. He said there were about 50 people at the Gooch Shelter. That's alot!!!!I was very thankful to sit and take my boots off.....until....I looked at my feet. I tried to save some money before hiking and use a pair of boots I had at home. I should have know better. They were too narrow in the toe bed and a half size too small. They work fine for regular hiking, but not hiking long distance. You just take a beating in a different way. So, Miss Janet drove me to an outfitter and I had to buy a new pair anyway. There goes 200$ I wasn't planning on.6 black toenails and lots of bruising and swelling but no blisters. Time to take vitamin I (ibuprofen). Time for bed.....tired","Hawk Mnt Shelter

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524426,"I opened my tent door this morning and realized the tent was surrounded by a lake after last night's storm and it was still storming. I looked at SkyHi and said I'm not hiking until it stops. I hate hiking in the rain. I know most people would say...it's part of thru hiking. Not if I can help it. I would rather stay in the tent and journal or rest and pack up a dry tent. When things start getting wet, it feels like you can't get dry again for days and I can't stand it. We are not on a time schedule. So, what's the rush. Taking a zero in the woods also means no money spent. When you take a zero in town it usually means hostel or hotel, food etc.For those of you who don't know, taking a zero means no miles hiked that day.I got out of my sleeping bag and realized my feet are worse. A day off will be good.There were a couple other hikers that decided to join us for the day. My body hurts all over.....ah the pain!!!! I forgot the pain.Here's the thing, I have pack explosions every morning. I'm just not organized..ever. The folks that hiked with me last time can attest to it. They all thought it was hilarious. Turtle tried explaining it to SkyHi ahead of time. He didn't quite understand until this morning ; )I was throwing things around trying to find my Red Sox hat when all of a sudden it dawned on me. Where the hell is my wallet? SkyHi said breathe. Just go through your pack again. So, I kept throwing things around....no wallet.Fisrt phone call was to Turtle...she answered the phone and quickly said Slickah I found it in the car. This is a new low even for me lol.So, I'm in the woods no ID and no money. Breathe!!Of course Turtle thought it was really funny given my pack explosion status and she used to see it every morning. No problem she said I'll mail it to Hiawassee. I was going to be there in a week. SkyHi and Miss Janet said they would float me until then.We just hung out all day with the other hikers in Gooch Gap. Alot of hikers are asking us advice on this and that. We are careful to give advice but not appear know-it-all.Miss Janet finally came back from her shuttles for the day. We had started a fire. She suprised me with a burger and fries....thank you my friend.Sleep","Gooch Gap

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524429,"Woke up this morning and bandaged everything up. Time to strap on the new boots and hike to Lance Creek. There are new regulations that state you can't camp between Lance Creek and Nell Gap because of bear. Scary. We don't have a bear cannister so Lance Creek it will be.Muscles feel better today. My hiking in general is better. It's amazing how much more pleasant things can be when you take 15lbs off your pack weight and prepare a little better. I will always have a hard time being on heart medication but my legs are strong. I just have to accept that my heart and lungs will never be on the same page as the rest of my body. That being said I'm just stubborn enough to keep going.The hiking was amazing today. We got to Lance Creek and set up. I took off the boots and socks....ugh!!! It's time to get to performing some minor surgery on the feet. Of course what to do in the middle of the wood? Clean with alcohol, sterilize needle. This is going to be gross, but some of what we deal with. I needed to relieve pressure under my toe nails. The pain is just too bad. Let's just say I drained blood and puss the best I could so I could get boots back on my feet. Oh and now I have blisters because of the new boots. So frustrating.More vitamin I and off to bed.","Gooch Gap

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527239,"The plan I to hike to Neel Gap today.We will pick up our first resupply. The hostel has been super busy and we aren't sure to get a spot, so we want to get there early. Also, this is 6 days since a shower and laundry. The anticipation is killing us.The hiking today was amazing. It has still been warm out. This also means the flowers are blooming early and the trees. It also means the snakes,bear, and wild hog are active.We made it to Neel Gap by 1pm. Got a spot in the hostel, thank God. The store has changed a lot since I was here last in 2010. George and Logan are doing a great job. They have a freezer there and it is full of pizza. I was so excited. Before anything else happened, George made me a pizza. I washed it down with a snickers and coke..For all the folks reading this in my personal training world, you are going to see me eat and drink lots of things I would not eat or drink in my regular world. The cravings are crazy. You burn sooooo many calories every day. I did vow to myself that this time around I'd throw a piece of lettuce in once and a while lol.On to showers and laundry. Hiker stink has arrived. It can't be helped. eeeewwwwww.The hostel was full and what a group of characters. So many people and so many personalities. Some folks are getting off trail already. They either aren't enjoying the hike because it's so difficult, or trying to hike too many miles and getting injured, etc.It sounds like 5-8 miles a day isn't very much. But your body HAS to acclimate and doing 15-20 miles a days asking for trouble. The terrain is punishing and add on to that a backpack......Well big day tomorrow..off to bed.","Lance Creek

I ended up taking my sleeping stuff and going to the main area and sleeping on the floor. Ugh, it's gonna be a long day. Many ups and downs today. One of my favorite spots is coming up...Wolf Laurel. It has amazing views.I have a lot of pain in my feet, after draining them again last night. We made it to Hog Pen Gap. The was no camping because it's at a road crossing. So, we had to water up and go into the woods a little. I'll tell ya, I had had it. We stealth camped. SkyHi had picked up a new 6oz Eno hammock. He was excited to give it a try.Put the tent up and climb in to examine the feet. Infection is something I'm concerned about at this point. Next set of draining and prepping complete. At this point it's time to decide whether to take a couple days off and heal.The usual end of day chores and ready for bed.The sunset was amazing.....again. We sure are spoiled.","Nell Gap

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527244,"Happy St.Patty's Day !!!!!Difficult day today. I'm in my head and feeling crummy. Of course it effects the hiking. We decided to hike to the campsite because the shelter was going to be busy. Nothing too exciting to report about the hike today. We got to the campsite and we were the only ones there for a good minute. So quiet.A gentleman and his dog showed up. Ralph and little Ralph. Ralph is a very nice guy out doing a section hike. He hiked too many miles for his dog, which you see a lot of. Little Ralph needs to get off trail. His side was worn raw from his pack and he is limping. Ralph is examining his options for getting the dog off the mountain. The hike down into Unicoi Gap is very difficult. We offered to hike with him tomorrow in case he needed to carry Little Ralph off the mountain.We all chatted for a long time then hit the sack.","Hog Pen Gap

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527245,"So sometimes you have a plan.......When you're hiking you learn that plans don't always happen, because you never know what's around the corner.We broke camp and headed towards Unicoi Gap. The hike down off the mountain is challenging. A lot of rocks.....down.We started to switch back towards the bottom and we smelled something amazing....food being grilled. OMG!!! we have to get there. Switchbacks are a bummer because you can see where you need to be but it takes forever to get there. We got to the bottom and headed across the street to the parking lot. A church group has come out to provide trail magic. This was trail magic on steroids. The amount of food and supplies was crazy. I was very greatful. What nice folks and so selfless.So, back to having a plan lol. You come across trail magic like that and it changes your perspective for the day. Well, maybe not everyone but definitely me. All of a sudden I'm fed and happy and not wanting to go anywhwere. SkyHi says OK let's go to Helen. I was very excited because I had wanted to go there in the first place.We were sitting around chatting with everyone and all of a sudden down come Ralph and Little Ralph. They made it. Ralph and the dog ended up getting a hitch with us into Helen. We stayed at the Helendorf. I love this place. The town of Helen is made to look like a little Scandanavian town. It's awesome.We all got settled and made a plan to meet up for a pint later.SkyHi and I went to the drugstore so I could by Epsom salts to soak the feet. Showered and laundered. SkyHi had never been to Helen before so we explored a little. Got a bite to eat and met up with Ralph. His wife is coming to pick up the dog and Ralph will finish his section hike.Back to the hotel and off to bed (like a real bed lol)","campsite before Blue Mnt Shelter

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527248,"I woke up in so much pain this morning I could hardly walk. The throbbing is excruciating. What to do. SkyHi is wanting to hike miles and clearly I need to zero and rest. Our first argument.......The bottom line is to spend money for another night, call Miss Janet to come and get me, SkyHi to hike on.....The result was SkyHi hiked on without me. Miss Janet came and picked me up. I am VERY thankful I know folks everywhere since my first thru hike. What that means for me is my decision making process is easier because I'll have a helping hand if needed. She ended up going back to Gooch Gap where trail magic is still going on. It was fun but freezing. I'm not sure how SkyHi is going to fare way up on that mountain. I slept in the van with Miss Janet. Thankful to have a roof over my head.The next day I zeroed. If I don't get these toes in order it could ruin my hike. I don't think they are infected.","head towards Tray mnt.

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527249,"I woke up in excruciating pain....ahhhh the throbbing. There is no way I can hike out today. SkyHi and I have our first argument. To stay and spend money, call Miss Janet to come and get me, SkyHi to hike out without me. The result is SkyHi to hike out without me. We both don't want to spend money but I would have like to suck it up and stay another night so I could soak my feet. Anyway Miss Janet would be coming to scoop me up later.I am very happy with all the folks I know from my first thru hike that all I have to do is find a phone signal and I'll be rescued. It sounds dramatic, but first time around I didn't have that. It is reassuring.We went back to Gooch Gap where there was trail magic happening. It was fun and got to see some folks I haven't seen in a while. Slept in the van with Miss Janet. It was freezing outside and I was happy to be in there.Next day zeroed in Helen. There were 4 of us. Nothing exciting we relaxed.I soaked my feet again. I'm concerned about infection although I don't have one yet. It could end my hike.They all got a hotel room because the forcast was calling for storms and snow. I hope SkyHi will be ok on the mountain.

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541276,"OK OK I know.....you think I'm not very good at this journaling thing. I haven't been very good at writing this time around. I was banking on hostels and hotels to have computers like the last time and they haven't. I try to save my battery on my cell phone,so, I hven't used that either.I'm going to try really hard for the second half.We are 36.6 miles away from West Virginia. Overall, the hike has been ok. I don't want folks reading this to think I have been miserable. That being said it hasn't been what I thought it would be. There have been times of frustration to the point I have wanted to bail. This has been for a lot of various reasons.The trail is VERY busy. From what I was just told 5500 thru hikers registered at Amicalola. That is ALOT, by at least 2x. At this point of the trail a lot of hikers have gotten off. I hate to sound like a jerk but I'm glad. One of the reasons I wanted to come out here for was solitude. Needless to say it was the opposite.My emotions and mental attitude are getting in the way this time, along with injury.For people who aren't familiar, the trail is constantly throwing curveballs at you that test your strength.I have decided that if it doesn't get better, I will go home. At this point I have nothing to prove since this is my second go around.I'm sorry I probably sound like a Debbie downer. As much as this is for other folks to read, it is for me , so I don't forget my experience.Moving on..........The wildlife is abundant, to say the least. A ton of bear, rattlesnakes, copperheads, dear etc. The rattlesnakes have me a bit on edage. On more than one occasion I have turned around to find a bear behind me. Also, mountain lion and bobcat sightings. One thing I have enjoyed is watching the forest come to life as spring rolled in. I'm enjoying learning about the flora. On my last thru hike, the weather was very different (cold) and I didn't see much. I am still leary about eating things other hikers tell me are edible...maybe a raspberry or two though.Coming soon will be Rocksylvania......One thing has remained true....the hiker community is amazing. People who drive by and offer water, come up to you and buy your dinner or offer rides etc. The list goes on.The trail is so hard on so many levels, that when selfless people offer to do nice things for you it can bring a tear to your eye.I would like to take the time and say thank you again to both my family (all) and SkyHi's family for being supportive in every way.....and of course Joanne and The Laporta's for taking care of Stella.....and Turtle for being amazing and helping me stay on trail.HAPPY BIRTHDAY JUDY lAPORTA!!!!!!! 90 YEARS YOUNGXOXOXOXO","Front Royal, VA

CitySlickah,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545153,"It is August 9th. We are going to cross the NJ/NY border. It has been quite a trip after I got back om the trail in July since my family emergency. I started hiking again but haven't been tapped into the trail. Boy, I'll tell you....my expectation of what I wanted from the trail and what has taken place are 2 completely different things. I'm sure I'll have lessons learned but not what I was looking for. I have been beat up physically and mentally and, quite frankly, not receptive to this experience. Will I quit???? no, but I have wanted to at times. I am going to see this through.In early VA I started to have foot pain. It got progressively worse even with shoe change out. By the time I got to Boiling Springs, PA I could barely walk. So, SkyHi hiked on and I waited in Delaware Water Gap for him. I took a full week at the church hostel to rest. Turns out I have an issue with my peroneous tendon in my right foot. The folks at the church hostel from Sherry, the pastor to everyone else, could not have been nicer and gone out of their way for me. I will be forever greatful. SkyHi showed up and we hiked NJ. NJ is great but all the rocks are testing this foot and ankle.One of the things that is keeping me going at this point is all of the folks coming to my rescue and allowing me to rest and have some fun.Thank you to the Colonel,PopTart, and Fire Hydrant and Bonzo. You guys are amazing!!!!!We have had a good mixture of trail and off trail fun. The trail has thinned out ALOT. This is really when you start solidifying your trail friendships. The hard part is here and going to get harder.Mostly all the people I have been around are loving their trail experiences. They have positive attitudes and are enjoying life. This is the way it should be. If the trail doesn't give you what you are looking for and you're not having fun you should stop.I really do like hiking. I do like the accomplishment of completing every day and knowing I did the work. It is very rewarding.Stay tuned for New England adventures.Good morning Judy!!!!!","jersey shore
