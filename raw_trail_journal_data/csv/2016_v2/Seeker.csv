Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526404,"Decided to start posting after getting my trail legs and on a zero day where AT&T actually provided service. I am now in Pearisburg VA with about 635 miles behind me as a Northbound thru hiker. Currently hiking with Last Chance from Lancaster County PA. The trail life is great in the sense of meeting lots of new people such as Crash, Nugget, and Booty. Right now trying to get in the groove of 15 miles per day and trying not to break any of the moving parts. Developed a blood blister in the area of the foot arch but nothing that a little Leukotape couldn't handle for now. Supposed to be some cod wet weather headed in tomorrow but will go ahead and set out first thing tomorrow with God willing and the creek don't rise. Lots of hikers just now rolling in so will log off for now to check the current commotion. Seeker ATTH 2015/2016 NoBo","Springer Mountain GA

Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527600,"Well this is my second post since restarting my 2015/16 AT Thru Hike back at Elk Park near Hwy 19 and just north of Roan Highlands in TN. After having experienced the circus maximus out of Springer in April 2015 I decided to do my thru hike by building a distance buffer in the fall of 2015 in order to have a 400 mile lead on the stampede when I restarted on March 14, 2016. That now done, I am presently up the trail around mile 728 and north of McAfee Knob and Dragons Tooth. The trek over the mountain ridge to Dragons Tooth a few days ago was a real test as we had to battle a snow storm with high winds and the ""circus trick"" rock climb below the tooth in order to get down to lower elevation. Glad that one is over as I had to stop constantly to warm my hands since did not bring over mitts for my gloves. Last Chance and I stayed at 4 Pines Hostel where we caught up with Booty, Rambo, and Blues Brother (the big miles boys) who had hunkered down to avoid the bad weather. Blues Brother took the down time to prep and cook a huge pot of awesome jambalaya to share with everyone. To top it off, Booty and Rambo cooked a big breakfast of sausage and pancakes the following morning. I wish I could keep up with those guys just to be part of the food situation. That trio is a great group of young men to be around regardless of the caloric benefit. At any rate, Last Chance and I continue our forward progress although his thru hike is completed at Harpers Ferry. Writing this from Daleville VA where we are doing resupply for the next leg of the trek. Now almost 1/3 the way to Katahdin ME and hope we can stay ahead of the big bubble rising out from Springer GA. As Allman Brothers said, ""ain't gonna let um catch me"".Seeker","Springer Mountain GA

Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529345,"Finally we find ourselves walking with Spring as we enjoy the blooms of trillium,dogwood, flame pink, bloodroot, spring beauty and many others that Last Chance (master Gardner) knows the names of. Warmth is a great welcome given the snow blizzard we slogged through over Dragons Tooth and the daunting feeling of breaking camp on freezing mornings. However the warmth brings other issues including the yang of sweating up long uphill ascents like the humps (Bald Mountain) out of Buena Vista and the relentless grind up Three Ridges Mountain following the downhill of the notorious Priest. I am now around mile 860 northbound and Last Chance tells me that these type of ascents will be gone until much farther north. That proclamation, whether true or not, is welcome as the mental aspect of a thru hike are starting to surface in the daily personal inquisition. I remind myself that my journey is driven by seeking the opportunity to better listen and discern the Lord's voice for the rest of my life in his service. That's more than enough purpose to drive me forward today.","

Seeker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530572,"Just hunkered down in Terrapin hostel near Front Royal at AT NoBo mile 966 after bad weather of cold, rain, fog and wind on ridges. Pretty much soaked to bone between sweat and driving rain. Thoughts again of exposure and hypothermia so cranked up the pace to get out of it ASAP. Learning that the logistical demands for staying on the trail involve a considerable amount of time beyond the hiking footwork. Last Chance will be finished when we reach Harper's Ferry so will be pushing out solo again amidst the bubble of hikers doing a flip flop hike. Using part of each hiking day to try and better listen for the Lord's voice or direction during this pilgrimage of reflection. Day is done and hoping for better weather.","
