UpLink,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524124,"So, I have been putting off starting this journal since my buddy, Lee and I have planned numerous trips and all have fallen through for one reason or another. I didn't believe it was actually going to happen but here I sit in the back of the car with our wives driving us up to GA to start our hike. I am not sure either of us is ready.Long hikes, short hikes, discussing gear, buying gear, trying food, etc... Not exactly sure what to expect as we have only hiked in Florida... You know, the flatlands.Lee is like a 5 year old, all excited and giddy... OK, I'm the same... But most who know me will tell you that I'm really a 5 year old in a 53 year old body... Never grow old, from what I've seen, it doesn't seem like too much fun.We shall see... On our way!",,On our way,"Mar 20, Sun",0

UpLink,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524704,"Kissed the wives goodbye and we were off! Excited, loaded down and at the first climb... Slightly winded. Finally, got to Springer and did it all... Photos, signed the book, hello to other climbers and headed to the shelter. My buddy was not happy about it so we decided since it was early to head out and see where we could get.   Ended up at the Stover Creo shelter and pitched outlet tents. Day one behind us and even though it was only 6pm, I asked if it was too early to go to bed... All around said yes, so we talked for an hour and turned in at 7.Great first day!","At the Falls

UpLink,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524708,"Up early and out the door ! Still excited, feeling good ready to go.The first food bridge and I almost had a problem but I regined my balance and only dropped one pole in the water... I was trying to do something and it clearly didn't work. Very pleasant walk and then we got to Long Creek Falls . Awesome sight . Then on to 2 big climbs and desents.   I'll just say walking on rocks is not fun but made it in time to Justus creek to get a great spot right next to the creek.Tired so we turned it early. (I'm seeing a pattern).","Springer Mtn

UpLink,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524713,"Sassafras Mtn was tough yesterday so I may look at my Guide more so I can get psyched up as needed... Not knowing what is ahead is scary and at the same time cool.Some really awesome views today. We talked about heading into a hostel tonight as the weather is not good and supposed to rain all night. John and I convinced Lee to press on to Lance creek and hunker down in our tents and ride it out. Unfortunately, all tent sites were occupied there so we had to move on.   Decided to go to Henry Gap @1 mile away as Lee said it didn't look too bad of an uphill climb, well and it gets us closer to Blood Mtn(4500ft) which is suppose to be pretty tough. So here's the thing... We think we missed Henry Gap... Pretty sure we did. Found a campsite at a small gap just after there... Again, we think.I am snug in my tent as the rain falls... Another successful day.BTW, I stood on Preaching Rock today... And did not get hit by lightning. Whooda thunk!","Justus Creek

UpLink,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524819,"Woke up early to a cold, windy day... Went back to bed which was warm and dry.Not often I get to do that.Finally got going on the trek to Blood MtnThe first climb was tough and it took me a good hour before I was feeling good. Lee left early and I caught up with him on the climb before Blood.I found the climb up Blood not a bad as I had envisioned but was still thrilled when I came around the bend and saw the shelter. Had lunch on the outlook with a group of college kids on spring break... From Florida, no less.The descent was difficult at first with all the rocks but got better, probably because we knew Blood Mtn cabins and a hot shower were at the bottom.Checked in and ordered a meat pizza and wings as an appetizer.I am now sitting on the back deck of the cabin in the sun, CLEAN, relaxed and content.Not sure what our plans are for tomorrow yet but will advise.First phase of the hike completed successfully!","Henry Gap

Level tent site will always make for a better night's sleepSet my tent up on a slight incline and kept sliding off my pad during the nightAwoke feeling a little tired, but packed up a wet rent as is rained all night Another note.... Helpful hint...a single wall tent accumulates condensation on the inside so you either need to wipe it down or dry out the tent... Go with a double wall, it will make life easier.Thought about my family a lot today, wish they. Plus all be here to experience this!Another night and some tough days coming...","Neels Gap

UpLink,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525141,"Left low gap shelter pretty early and the fog was here.We were to be up over 3000ft all day and it felt that way The walk was awesome and different... No views other that the feeling you were in a Wes Craven movie set, eerie, fog and a soft drizzle most of the day. My legs felt strong and the miles were flying by, very enjoyable.Lee left camp before me but we had decided to go into Helen tonight to see the city, so we only needed to go to Unicoi gap @ 9.7 miles out ending with the descent down Blue Mtn... @1100 ft in 1.5miles... I can't really explain that descent, one of the hardest so far, slippery rocks, roots and mud... One of the best feelings so far was reaching the bottom... I had called Tammy from the top of Blue and got to talk to Talley and Seth also.... They were preparing Easter birch for the family... Very cool, but I was thinking about a mamossa ....When we got to the Jnicoi parking lot it was raining pretty good, but apparently a group of folks had set up our Easter brunch ... More trail magic... WoohooI facetimed the family to show them our brunch and got to talk to them all including Braxton, my grandson who had to show off his e aster basket and a large egg he was chasing around... A great dayGot even better when Boy Wonder(a southbound they hiker in 2010) showed up and offered us a ride into Helen... Very cool to all involved","Low Gap shelter

I'm sure she will enjoy the view.Our first summit over 5400 ft. Made the gradual descent to Carter Gap shelter and was thrilled after the long day when we got there.Weather tonight is a little scary as it calls for 24 degrees and wind gusts up to 65mph Pitched my tent securely and was ready for the night.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

UpLink,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526291,"Rough night as it was very cold and the Wind... You could hear the gusts coming from a long way away until it got to the tent and shook the whole thing. Didn't sleep well and woke up with numb toes and fingers. Loaded up and got on the trial pretty quickly. I think I had all the clothing I had with me on, including my rain gear pants. Fairly easy going for the first couple of hours and then we got tot the climb to Albert Mtn... The way up was cool as you are on a small ledge of a trail with some great overlooks then it lulls you into comfort as you approach and see the fire tower atop Albert MtnThe last 1/2 mile or so was brutal and awesome at the same time as it was very vertical and you had to use hands and feet to climb.The view at the top was worth it allI took a few panoramic pix and climbed up the observation tower and took more... Beautiful day for pictures.   The walk down from there was pretty smooth sailing but I had some foot issues flair up and by the time we got to Rock Gap for pickup my dogs were barking. Fortunately, a hotel, a shower and a good meal are not too far away.Ready for a break and some R and R.Sorry for the sporadic updates but cell service in NC is sporadic.On to tomorrow!","Carter Gap Shelter

And decided to adopt the trail name ""Uplink"" given to me by 11:30 the other day.   He claimed I was always connected and I agree...Had dinner and drinks with Bushwacker, Yacky and Lee tonight and realized the closeness of the hiker community as we saw some familiar faces all over town.A few beers at The Lazy Hiker, dinner at Fat Buddies where Lee and I ate way too much and then a nightcap (@8:30 mind you) at Fatz watching part of the NCAA finals.Spoke to Tammy and realized some of the things I am missing being out here, especially her.I still think and feel that this is one of the coolest things I have ever done, just wish I could share it with all of those close to me. BTW, still got my miles(@3 or so) in today as I walked to do laundry and then to the library in town to do a few hours of work...Three days and into NOC for the festival, should be fun and I can't wait...Onward...","Rock Gap

UpLink,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526821,"Started out of Franklin after a nice breakfast and the thought of doing 10-12 miles as we are only @30 miles to the NOC... Started out great, got to Winding Stair Gap pretty quickly and easily (@3.5 miles)... Things going well with my legs in great shape after the rest... Out of nowhere came out into a meadow just below Siler Bald.... We took about a ten minute nap, ate something and some of the other hikers convinced us it was a good idea to walk up the hill to the bald.   Wow! The 360 degree view was unbelievable... Took some great pictures including the panoramic. Took a few minutes to enjoy it and we were back at it.   Thought we would go @12 miles as we were feeling good but at 12 miles decided to plug along... Got to the Wilson Lick trail and I was shot but we still decided to go on, and made it to the Wayah Blad tower... Man, more awesome views... Made it to the shelter but late so the tent spots were not good and we were spent, no energy even to make dinner. Sat by the fire trying to warm up for a few and hit the sack.   My tent was on a pretty bad incline so I kept slipping off the pad and had a very poor nights sleep... After 14.8 miles that dors not help, even the cold was cold. Note to self...listen to your body and stop when it tells you... You will regret it.Also early to the shelters means picking the best spots (in my opinion, most level)...something to keep in mind.A very long day with the last few miles very tough and my lower legs felt it.Tired, sore and a little weary...Onward !","Franklin

Got out of my tent @ 30 mins after he left and went straight to the closest fire to try and get warm. Sat for a few and talked with a few guys about the conditions and went and got packed up...so cold as my fingers and toes were numb so I packed up and went back to the fire before heading out.It was rough going from the get go...My legs were sore from yesterday and had a tough time getting in the rythem of walking... Tried slow, fast, anything I could think of but just a tough day.Texted Lee and he was a good mile agead of me, no chance I was catching him but kept plugging along. Next time I got a signal Lee told me had called and got a cabin at the Nantahala Mtn Lodge, it was the best news I had heard in a while...gave me a little pick-me-up and got going. 20mins later I was just sore and going downhill off of Copper Ridge Bald... there at the bottom they were waiting.A sight for very sore eyes to say the least.If you have a chance stay with Steve and Maggie at the lodge... Northcarolinalogcabin.rentals/atThey are awesome and the facility is fanfastic.It's like they are welcoming their own family to their place...

UpLink,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526830,"Lee and I discussed it yesterday and I really need to get back to work so we decided to cut out after the NOC festival. After a great night's sleep, a great dinner and breakfast at the Nantahala Mountain Lodge, we set out on our last day of hiking on this section hike. Really can't say enough good about Steve and Maggie.We had a few climbs and a huge descent into the NOC. It was a great hike and I am very happy that it was... After the last two days, I wanted to end this trip on a high note and it was exactly that. A great hike, great views and tough downhill into the NOC. Cabin wasn't ready so we HAD to go to lunch immediately and sat by the river drinking a cold beverage or two.I can't describe what we just did...hard, awesome, rewarding, relaxing, taxing, so many feelings and things going on in my head these past few weeks.Still one of the coolest things I have ever done. I can't wait to get back for the next section we choose to do.And kudos to Lee for quitting smoking when we left and never complaining about needing another smoke... Keep it up, my friend.Looking very much forward to the next chapter in this book...Looking forward to seeing Tammy and the kids to share the experience.Thanks to all for the support and kind words....
