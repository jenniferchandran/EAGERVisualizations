Hey Girl!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552230,"After starting on Springer Mountain, GA, the southern starting point of the trail, I walked into the woods and ended up at Stover Creek Shelter. It was there that I met other AT thru-hikers including ""Patriot,"" my first trail friend.","Springer Mountain, GA

Hey Girl!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552232,"Today Hatchet and I hiked our first big mountain in the White Mountains--Mount Moosilauke. It was straight up for 3 miles, then flattened out at the top with a gorgeous walk through evergreens and then above the treeline. The walk down was even more challenging and fun than the walk up. The descent was rocky, rooty, challenging and then parallel to a famous waterfall and brook along the trail. That waterfall is no joke and is tricky and technical. Hatchet and I walked this entire part together until reaching a parking lot. He looked out for me and I watched him ahead of me. Having a hiking partner in the Whites sure is nice. This was the day we realized there are so many points when one can get hurt. We had a ball and joked that this truly was different than every other mile thus far. All the teasing SOBOs had done in telling us ""You haven't hiked until you've been to the Whites,"" actually seemed correct. My thighs were burning from more exertion than any day yet; but I loved it. At one point Hatchet also stopped to chop a downed tree in the trail and get it out of the way. He has done this often and since Pennsylvania. This particular tree was more of a challenge, however, as it was across the narrow trail on Moosilauke while also crossing close to the running waterfall. By the end of the night we hitched a ride into Lincoln, NH, ate barbecue and then stayed at Chet's Place, a hostel at a local trail angel's house.","Stealth Site by Hiker's Welcome Hostel

Hey Girl!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552228,"I ended my thru-hike today as an Appalachian Trail (AT) northbounder (NOBO). I summited Mount Katahdin with some of my closest trail friends--Hatchet, Little Sister, Scavenger, Doc and Jeff Davis. Queen Sweeper (who was calling herself ""Cherry on Top"" and handing out maraschino cherries at the Katahdin sign), Chef Tumbleweed and Footlong were also atop the summit with us. 
After touching the Katahdin sign and taking lots of pictures, Hatchet, Little Sister, Scavenger, Doc, Jeff Davis and I all continued on to the Knife's Edge for a dramatic and fun walk down the mountain. There simply was no better way to end the day.
Later that evening we were all back in Millinocket and sharing a hotel room along with Uncle Spider and Reptar, too. The end of our thru-hike seemed unreal but also satisfying. Physically we were all exhausted, proud and sentimental about the end of this 2,189.1 mile journey.","The Birches Campground
