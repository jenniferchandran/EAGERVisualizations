pat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521724,"Pat here:So over the last week I was enrolled in my final college credit course which was a Leave No Trace Master Course through NOLS. The course focused on understanding the fundamental 7 principles of Leave No Trace and the personal development of becoming a better outdoor educator. I used this course as the first of many ""shake down"" hikes prior to our Southbound (SOBO) Appalachian Trail Thru Hike. My base pack weight with group gear, food, personal gear, and 1 L of water weighed in at just over 27 pounds. I was pretty stoked with this because I was using a larger and heavy pack. I am currently sitting at a coffee shop writing a reflection paper on my final course for college and realized the benefits it held as a shake down. I realized that for meal planning that I don't need complicated multi pot meals to thrive, but I sure do need my 2 cups of hot coffee each morning. With my first shake down out of the way I am now toying with my gear list in my head to figure out what I need and what can be pulled out of my pack. Toying with this I have also have confronted myself about my training... So far I really haven't been doing anything and need to build my ""thru-hiker body"" before departing in 4 months. Now with my reflection paper halfway done, my final course out of the way, and my training about to begin, I anxiously wait for our departure date from Colorado in June.","Saguaro National Parl

pat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521703,"Dear Inter-web world.My name is Pat Donahue and this journal will be an active account of the preparation and on-trail life of my self and my girlfriend of 5 years Abby Keelty. We are setting out as a couple to achieve a life time goal for both of us. Our passion to through hike the A.T. has been a long road of dreams and aspirations. For Pat, this journey started as a young teen growing up in New England exploring what the A.T. had to offer in New Hampshire's White Mountains and the desire for exploration. For Abby, this journey and dream started to take shape when she first heard about the trail while attending boarding school in New Hampshire (where we met ;] ). This dream is finally coming true for her as she nears the end of her college career and couldn't think of a better time to set out on a life changing exploration through some of the countries oldest states. The A.T. for both of them resembles our passion and dedication to one an other throughout the five years of being together and believe that the trail will only bring us closer to one another. We are starting this trail journal because we believe that we will share an interesting perspective as a couple, that are preparing and attempting to through hike the A.T. SouthBound starting in June 2016. We both have a unique story to tell and believe that having a single trail journal will help us share our experiences as a couple. We believe that there are not enough distinct perspective of through hiking as a couple. Happy Trails-Pat Donahue",,Appalachian Trail,"Feb 23, Tue",0
pat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522829,"On Friday afternoon we pack our day packs with about 10 pound of water and set out to hike a local loop. The loop consisted of shoreline, steep hill climbs, and gorgeous views. the entire hike took us just under 1.5 hours with one short stop for a water break. We are looking forward to extending our miles and pac weight in the next few months to come. -PAT","Maxwells Trailhead Fort Collins, CO

pat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526409,So yesterday I used my REI dividend and 20% off coupon to purchase a new smaller pack. i settled on getting an Osprey Exos 58. it comes in just over 2 pounds and the thing is unbelievable. I packed it up today with all my gear for my AT thru hike minus Food and some small odds and ends. with 2 liters of water my pack comes in just under 19 pounds. I'm pretty stoked. With new gear and wonderful weather today (70f and sunny) i decided to go out for a short day hike. I crushed 6.4 miles in just over 2 hours with one break that was about 15-20 long. I couldn't be more stoked to hit the trail in rough 45 days. till next time happy trails- PAT,"Maxwell Loop and A Mountain

pat,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530116,"This morning I submitted my official 2 week notice to quoting my job and my lease ends this Saturday.In 26 days Abby and I will make our first steps on the Appalachian Trail. This has both been a long time dream for us and as we near I know my nerves are shaking from excitement and the unknown, but we still have some hurdles to over come (Mail drops for New England, Driving across Country, ect.). We just made our first big order from harmony house foods for veggies and powder tomato sauce.  We are slowly repacking and unpacking our bags and lists are being made for final items to be purchased and items to be made (ground cloth). We look forward to updating our journal as we continue on out journey. till next time Cheers.","
