After much digging through luggage he found an email address and finally a cell phone number. We managed to contact his wife and the happy couple were reunited. Soon after , late plane 19 years old Patrick from new jersey (trail name sausage roll) showed up and the hostel shuttle arrived shortly after. The shuttle driver was a hiker as well and we all swapped stories on hiking adventures and such. Sausage roll and I stayed in the same bunk room with two other hikers, enjoying each other's good cheer. Everyone almost to excited to sleep. The hostel had approximately 24 guests and I had many other pleasant encounters with fellow thru hikers. We all ate breakfast together at the hostel the next morning, everyone settled their bill and we were all hurried to the shuttles heading to the trail, very fun ride about an hour away, up a crooked mountain road, which eventually turned into a bumpy gravel road.
