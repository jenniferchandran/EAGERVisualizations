Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529603,"Excited to finally be on my way after spending the night in Harper's Ferry with my parents. Saying goodbye was a bit bittersweet though. Pretty moderate terrain to start. Accidentally passed my first shelter I had intended on staying at.. but only had to tack on a few extra miles to make it to Blackburn AT Center. Turns out the first shelter had a leaky roof anyhow according to the trail maintainer that I met along the way. No caretaker at the main building here, which stands alone at the end of a long dirt access road. Spent the night in the four bunk cabin with two other hikers. Didn't take advantage of the wood stove, unfortunately. Thankful to have a good roof over my head after waking up to thunder and rain battering the tin overhead. Spring is already in the air here, making for a beautiful walk amongst the budding trees and blooming flowers. The butterflies are all over parts of the trail, and I even surprised a few whitetail deer crossing the path earlier.","Harper's Ferry, WV

Also got my first breathtaking view of the green valley below with mountain peaks jutting up in the distance. Had lunch and watched the turkey vultures coasting around. Unfortunately I can hear the road from where I made camp tonight, but on the plus side I seem to have the whole place to myself. Just the way I like it.","Blackburn Shelter

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529607,"Left my glasses behind at camp this morning... I figured it was going to happen sooner or later but it's only day 3. Luckily they were right where I thought they'd be, but the 4 mile there and back detour still left a sour taste in my mouth to start the day. Yet, things quickly improved further down the trail with a close encounter with a fawn. It was about 50' away when I turned a corner and spotted it right in the middle of the trail. Surprisingly, it wasn't very timid because I was able to snap a few photos and even inch closer to within 30' before it finally spooked. I watched for awhile as its' mom came over the ridge, paused for a quick photo, and made her way across the trail to join her baby. Now that's what I'd consider ""trail magic.""","stealth camp

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529609,"Had a nice ride on the section of trail named ""the roller coaster,"" but glad to have put it behind me. 13.5 miles of nothing but ascents and descents on somewhat rocky terrain has taken a toll on my Achilles. Should work itself out in due time given the whole R.I.C.E procedure, but one can only get so much of that out here. Can only limit my physical activity by so much, ice my tendon in the cold streams, and occasionally elevate it on a well placed rock or stump at camp. I texted a new orthopedic doctor I had seen just before leaving (shout out to Shannan Hardy) about the issue and she responded within minutes. In short, she has been nothing short of phenomenal with all that she's done for me, and I feel much more comfortable in my physical approach to hitting the trail because of her. Anyhow, until it works itself out (which it WILL), I'm just merely trying to correct my stride, slow my pace, and soak it in the icy cold water along the way. Otherwise, everything has been pretty perfect. Currently set up in a cozy little octagon shaped shelter, listening to the flow of the water along the rocks around me, not 10' from where I lay in the shelter. Stars are out, owls are hooting, life is good.","Rod Hollow Shelter

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529610,"Don't believe I've yet to leave camp before 10am yet. Despite waking up around 7 ever morning, I never feel rushed to get up and go. I'll typically have my coffee, visit the privy, eat breakfast, and do my knee exercises; pretty much in that exact order. I even made a small fire this morning to toast my bagel over. Came across my first bit of ""trail magic"" today. A whole group of people had set up various platters of home cooked food, bowls of fruit, and a cooler full of powerade and water in one of the parking lots that the AT crosses through. Very nice folks. Ate way too much and had to face what seemed like a never ending uphill struggle. Soon after I encountered two local ""old timers"" that were out for a stroll with their dog. We got to talking and the woman mentioned that she had seen some watercress in the stream further down, and to be on the lookout if I wanted to gather some fresh herbs for my supper. When I inquired as to what those were she referred to me as a ""city slicker"" and proceeded to walk down with me to pick some, all the while her companion talked about the areas rich history from the Native Americans and Civil War days. Now I'm just a few miles from my first resupply in Front Royal, VA at the most beautiful shelter with all the ""bells and whistles."" There's a picnic table underneath a patio set off to the side with a horseshoe ring nearby to pass the time. The shelter has a spacious front porch with a wrap around bench and Adirondack chairs. But the best feature was the gravity fed shower. Had a quick rinse while I was still hot and sweaty from hiking, but boy that stream water is cold!

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529617,"No vacancy at the hostel I was hoping to stay at so I picked up my package, got a lift into town for a few things, and then headed back up the mountainside. Met another South bounder, Dorothy (so named because of her red trail shoes), who had stayed at the hostel the night before. Might have overdone it a bit on the resupply, but it's hard to find certain things in small quantities, especially when you don't have the convenience of driving around to multiple stores. Added a few pounds to the pack and a few blisters on my feet, but I honestly can't wait to cross into Shenandoah National Park (SNP) tomorrow. Oh, and I had yet another close encounter with a fawn today on the trail. This one was even closer though, maybe 25' away. Got the pictures again to prove it too! He seemed quite comfortable in my presence to where he actually started making his way towards me, while grazing away at the plants to either side of the trail. Turned out there were 2 fawns and 2 doe's altogether which I contently watched for the better part of an hour.","Jim and Molly Denton

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529627,"Didn't make it out of camp until pretty late this morning. Walked maybe half a mile then stopped at the shelter to stretch quickly. Of course I happen to get talking with some day hiker who had just climbed up the hill ahead of his group. As we're talking he pulled out a 6 pack and without even asking, cracks one open and hands it to me. Some cheap piss beer but even at 11am it tasted pretty damn good. Great start to the day! Even better end to the day being in SNP. Decided to stay and watch the sunset from atop Mt. Marshall and walked the last mile or two to the shelter with my headlamp. Well worth it. Mike and Dorothy were already there with a nice fire going. Saw my first mouse in that shelter but luckily didn't get into any of my things.","stealth camping

Duct tape is apparently not the way to go according to other hikers I've asked along the way, especially when it's the non stick crap from Walmart. Apparently there is a pretty sizable wildfire 50 miles south which has closed off some 5 miles or so of trail on the AT. Hope it's cleared out by the time I get there. Came across my first camp store (or wayside as they're called in the park) and treated myself to a good IPA, a bag of jalapeno chips, and a blackberry shake; which I had been told was a hiker tradition of sorts. Beer and chips were fantastic. I don't recommend the shake, but that's just me. ""Stealth camping"" tonight (as Mike calls it) with both Mike and Dorothy. Made it a short day in order to set us up for making it to a shelter tomorrow night that I had heard excellent reviews about from other hikers. Last night was the first completely restful sleep I've had where I didn't wake up cold at all. Seems to be warming up all around though. It was in the 80's today which is plenty hot for me.

All three of us made it there for the sunset, which we laid back and watched right from the Hut. Nice stone, 3 sided shelter with a big ol' fireplace inside which we kept going for most of the night.

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529644,Approaching the rapidly growing forest fire thats been raging in the southern portion of SNP since Saturday. The wind shifted yesterday which had brought the smoke into view on the horizon and in the valley below. Rumor has it they're shuttling hikers past it some 15 miles. No rain expected until Friday so unfortunately I may be forced to skip that section of trail after all. Finally got myself a decent meal at Skyland Restaurant with Mike today. Was only .2 miles off the trail and I was pretty intent on making it there for lunch between 12 - 2. Practically ran the last mile or two to get there before they stopped seating people. In my rush to make good time I accidentally found myself following a spur trail for 15-20 minutes (uphill of course) before realizing that I had missed a turn. Still managed to make it for lunch with 5 minutes to spare. Can see lots of smoke blowing around in the foothills from where Mike and I camped out tonight. Not sure what happened to Dorothy but she has yet to make it into camp. Saw another good sunset through the trees. The Sun looked blood red as it went down through the smoky haze.,"Byrds Nest #3 Hut

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529646,"Met the infamous Bonnie & Clyde this morning. Really nice couple headed NOBO whom I never would've met had I rushed out early like most everyone else. Met another nice fellow William who was day hiking in the area as well. I never seem to cover much mileage until the afternoon when I see less people, or at least those I do see are looking to get to where they're going and not stand around swapping life stories with you for an hour. But that doesn't bother me in the slightest. Part of the experience, for me anyways, is in those various interactions you have with other people you meet along the way. You never know who you might meet and there are definitely some very interesting folks out here from all walks of life. Got to another wayside where I replenished some supplies and ended up having a quick lunch again with Stone Age. Arrived at the Bearfence Hut before dark at least. Opting to stay in the shelter tonight, as rain is in the forecast til sometime tomorrow. Much needed for the forest fire which has now grown to over 6500 acres. After the wind shifted again last night, most of the views I came across today were shrouded in smoke. Turns out I'm closer to it than I had thought. As of earlier today, park officials were shuttling people from Swift Run Gap, around the fire to the Southern Park entrance which is just outside the town of Waynesboro where my next package awaits. From here it's only about 9 miles to Swift Run Gap, and unless things change overnight, I should be in town by tomorrow evening. Kinda disappointing to have to miss the last bit of SNP but I'll just have to come back another time is all. Must admit I'm looking forward to a shower most. Although the combined stench of myself and the other 4 hikers here makes me feel okay about it. Thankfully it's not an enclosed space.","Rock Spring Hut

Not last night like expected, but instead held off until I was packed up and ready to leave the shelter this morning. Stone Age left well before me and missed our meeting point where we were supposed to determine where we wanted to camp out close to where we'd be catching the shuttle (from what I've come to know of him in just this short time, I'm not surprised haha). That way we figured we could split the cost of a room and make a day out of it in town. Also heard from some people that police had finally found the body of a woman who had gone missing after parking her car in SNP nearly a week ago. Funny how information is relayed from hiker to hiker down the chain of communication on the trail. Fire has grown to over 9,000 acres now too.

A whole network of ""trail angels"" from all over have come together to help the park shuttle hikers around the fire. The woman who picked me up (April) lived a few hours away and was simply doing this out of pure kindness. Pretty amazing really. Opted to camp out in the YMCA pavilion for free rather than spend the money on a room. If only Stone Age were here... Still, I finally got my shower at the YMCA, did my laundry at the laundromat, picked up my package, over stocked on food again at the grocery store, and pigged out at the local all you can eat Chinese buffet. Also got a ride from a guy Hal who stopped by to see if anyone wanted to get food at his local church's BBQ. 50 cents for a hot dog, bag of chips and a soda. Got 6 hot dogs which didn't even last the ride back to the pavilion. All in all a good day in town.","stealth camping

He generously offered to share his room at the Quality Inn with me, so I graciously accepted. My feet are especially thankful. Felt great to lounge around all day, take a real shower with shampoo, and explore the town a bit with Stone Age. Also caught up on all things political thanks to his obsession with Fox News, which apparently talks politics 24/7. At least he's not a Hilary or Trump supporter I suppose, haha.

Even still, by the end of the day I'm back to feeling grungy all over again. Just the two of us sharing the shelter with another girl named Emily tonight. Seems we may be seeing more of her in the next few days as she claims to be covering about the same mileage as we have been. The first thing I noticed about her was her pack. Looked to be about twice her size, and yet she seemed to carry it effortlessly. Turns out she used to work at an outfitter and, among other things, helped fit customers to backpacks. She took a look at mine for me and made adjustments in places I didn't even know were adjustable. Hopefully it helps.","Waynesboro, VA

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532218,"It's a nice change being down in the valley where the vegetation is lush and everything is green. But it wasn't long before the trail ascended back up the ridge line, and thus come the switchback's and rough, rocky terrain. Never seems to stay level for very long. Yet, the constant views as you're walking the ridges and meandering up and over the mountains are truly spectacular and remind us of why we do what we do on a daily basis. The aches and pains and seemingly miserable days are a comparatively small price to pay for such rewarding experiences. For instance, tonight I' m camped out at a relatively exposed location and under less than ideal conditions. Managed to find a flat spot up on the ridge at a nice overlook where earlier I could look out and actually see the blue sky being overtaken by a wall of rain headed right my way. It had already been a long day and I really did not want to be setting up my tent in the rain so I chose the first flat area I could find. Despite not having a water source or any decent trees in which to hang a bear bag, my tent was pitched before the heavy rain hit. Wasn't the greatest spot, but watching the thunderstorm that night made it all worthwhile. I happened to be on the phone with Christina when my tent began lighting up with a series of lightning flashes. The rain from earlier had stopped by then, so I went outside to watch the storm. It started in the valley with a series of lightning strikes across the distant ridge line. As it got closer I could see the bolts cutting through the sky. Then came the fog, creeping up the mountainside until you could no long see the city lights below. With a massive crack of thunder overhead and a sudden downpour of rain, the storm was suddenly upon me. I quickly jumped back in my tent, but the rain was coming down so hard it was splashing up into the tent. The wind kicked in pretty strong to where my 2-person tent was bent into a 1-person. I could hardly hear myself think let alone talk to Christina (sorry, I know I got pretty excited and distracted by the storm). That half hour or so, more than made up for having to pack up my wet tent in the rain and everything else. It's all about one's outlook and attitude in such moments.","Paul C. Wolfe Shelter

Drizzled occasionally during the day but other than that just overcast. Reconnected with Emily and Stone Age tonight. We're camped out together across the stream from the shelter which was suprisingly full. Started to rain again just as we were making camp, but let up long enough for us to sit around and have a few good laughs. Gonna try to get Stone Age to tell one of these women that his trail name is God's Gift To Women haha. Might clear out the shelter anyhow.

Such a great hiking partner though. Always had anything you could ever need and was so giving with everything she had. Maybe she was just looking to get rid of some weight but between topping off my fuel canister and insisting on me keeping her Swiss Army knife which I had been using to cut my moleskin, her generosity makes her a trail angel by my account. Packed up in the rain and headed out into the misty morning woods. Climbed and conquered The Priest (Mountain) today. 4.5 miles and over 3,000' feet of all uphill climbing during which one is supposed to reflect on their sins and then apparently confess them in the logbook at The Priest Shelter. The logbook begins with ""Father forgive me for I have sinned.."" and some of the confessions can be quite amusing to say the least. A brief thunderstorm brought a shower of rain, followed by blue skies. Weird weather today. Walking up the ridge you could even feel the difference in the air temperature from one side to the other. As it started to get dark I sat outside the shelter and watched the storm in the distance. The clouds were spectacular looking as they were illuminated by the lightning flashes, and the occasional bolt of lightning streaking out of the sky made for a good ending to the day. Also learned the PCT bear bagging technique. Great method which I'll be primarily using from here on out.","Harper's Creek Shelter

The valleys below were shrouded from view so that all you could see were the mountain tops rising up out of the mist. After descending for quite awhile the fog finally set in. Got pretty damp and cold from there on out. Camped out in the meadows with Stone Age, but we're not alone.

One nice thing about being at a shelter is the luxury of having a privy to do your business in. I don't mind digging a hold and hugging a tree, but an open meadow occupied by weekenders leaves limited options for privacy. After about a mile or two I crossed paths with two NOBO's, Wizard and Strummy Stick, whom I happily chatted with for a good while. Strummy Stick asked if I wanted some homemade cookies and brownies and proceeded to give me several cookies and the last of the brownie pieces which he dumped into a plastic bag for me. ""A bit of trail magic"" he said. Strummy Stick got his name because of the guitar he carries with him, whereas Wizard carried two self-customized bamboo sticks for hiking poles. On the end of one stick he had a fishing rod tip and on the the other he had fashioned a 6-8 inch long spear which he claimed was a bear deterrent. The brownies had nuts in them and the cookies were oatmeal raisin, both of which I've never been fond of, but wow these were delicious! Wizard, who had been on the trail prior to a knee injury a few years back game me the most helpful advice on preventing and caring for my blisters. Apparently people used to seek him out on the trail for his wisdom and taping technique. Unfortunately it was raining, so I didn't exactly feel it was the appropriate time to ask about having a look at my blister ridden feet. Met Stone Age at the road and within 5-10 minutes we hitched a ride with a few turkey hunters all the way past Buena Vista to Lexington where my resupply box awaited me at WalkAbout Outfitters. The staff there was so accommodating and friendly, letting us sprawl out off to the side of the store with our wet gear, took our trash, and let us use their bathroom. I love getting these resupply packages. Even though they're primarily for my diabetes supplies, my wonderful parents fill them with various treats and such. It feels like Christmas every time I get one. This time my mother included a bag of individually wrapped, delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies. Gave one to Stone Age and two of the staff that had been so kind to us dirty smelly hikers in their nice clean store. Left our bags and walked to Wendy's and the grocery store. Bought myself a 20L dry bag at the outfitter to replace the insufficient 13L bag I had been using as my food bag.

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532285,"What a great day. Sun came out after another storm blew through last night. I liked being down in the lush valley yesterday, but the views of the James River from atop Bluff Mtn. and all the way down the ridge was incredible. Had planned on stopping in the nearby town of Glasgow today after hearing from other hiker's that it was worth checking out. Stone Age had a good head start on me, given my lengthy foot preparation and taping process to begin the day, so it didn't surprise me when I didn't see him at the road crossing. Just as I was getting my bearings it began to pour. With hardly any shoulder to the road and 6 miles to town I began throwing up the thumb at passing cars. After about 5 minutes a big Ford truck pulled over so I thew my bag in the bed and jumped in. Thus began one of the most truly remarkable experiences of my trip. His name was Marc and he had by far one of the strongest Southern accents I've ever encountered. First thing he did was hand me a cold beer out of the cab. ""Drink on up buddy, there's plenty more for ya in the back."" He started telling me about his family being one of the very first to settle in the county and talked of various historical parts of the towns history. Took me through town to a place where he thought I could get a hot meal. Come to find out most places are closed Monday, so he got on the phone with his wife and the next thing I knew he was bringing me home for dinner. We drove through the beautiful back-country hills and occasionally stopped to look at views and pieces of history from the towns former days when rich ore was discovered nearby. The booming town came and went when even richer deposits were found in PA. Horses and oxen used to pull barges of people and goods along the canal system through town. In those same tracks now lies the railroad tracks. By the time we had gotten to his house I had a few beers in me. He kept saying ""it's not much, for we ain't fancy folk."" The house was up on the hillside, looking over the valley and it's surrounding mountains. The location was perfect and even the house itself was quite nice. He had built it himself years ago while living in a tent on the property. No sooner had we gotten inside then it started to pour again. It was really nice to be indoors watching the storm; especially given the marble size hail that was coming down at one point. Dinner was definitely the highlight though. Roast beef, potato salad, biscuits with apple butter, greens of some sort, and a macaroni casserole which I couldn't get enough of. Marc made sure my plate was full each time saying ""go on buddy, getchu s'more"" as he took the liberty of piling on more and more food. Also got called a Yankee for the first time for not knowing what apple butter was. His wonderful wife Sheila sent me back with a big container of it. Everyone back at the hiker pavilion made quick work of that. I was lucky enough to get the last of 6 bunks under the shelter, but unfortunately subjected to the top 3rd row platform with just enough headroom to crawl into bed. Yet after my experience with Marc and his family, I could care less that there are nails protruding through the plywood just above my head. The fact that this simple man and his family, who don't have much to begin with are willing to open their home to a complete stranger goes to show that there are a lot of good, kind-hearted people out there; despite what we hear on the news on a regular basis. Finished off the night with a bag of jalapeno chips and a pint of ice cream from the small grocery express across the street. It amazes me just how hungry I seem to get in town. Once you satisfy one craving, another immediately sets in to take its place.","Punchbowl Shelter

I guess there used to be some dinosaur exhibit in a nearby town that it was originally catering to, but now it looks a bit out of place to say the least. Did some shopping at the only two stores in town and finally made it to the post office during business hours and mailed a few things home. Got lunch at the restaurant with Stone Age and had the best cowboy burger and fries for only $6.50. Washed my clothes at the laundromat which I mistook for an abandoned building at first, and even took a hot shower in the stall set up next to the hiker pavilion. Got picked up while walking out of town by Travis who stopped to show me yet another nice view of the James River from the road. Didn't get back on the trail until after 5, as I attempted to wait out the afternoon rainstorm. Crossed over the James River footbridge, the longest footbridge on the AT, and hiked only a few miles to the next shelter. The storm last night brought down quite a few good size trees and turned the simple stone hopping creek crossings into hazardous, foot soaking rivers. At least I wont have to worry about as many dry water sources now. Also the first night that the stars have been out in awhile which is nice.

It's been quite awhile since I've spent a night alone unfortunately. The shelters have their perks and all but as of lately, you're almost guaranteed to be sharing the space with fellow hikers. Then comes the same general questions and small talk, which normally I don't mind, but the introvert in me could use a night or two of solitude. So I made it a point to find myself a nice camping spot away from any shelters. Found a great area about halfway up Thunder Ridge with a nice flat spot, a good rock on which to sit and cook,and access to a spring a short distance away. No sooner had I set up my tent then a guy and his dog showed up looking to spend the night. We exchanged a few friendly words but for the most part I must admit to being a bit antisocial.

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533675,"Heard the rain droplets hitting my rain fly early this morning which prompted me to fall back asleep in hopes that it was just a passing shower. Woke up soon after to a heavy rain and the urge to make my morning routine visit to the privy. I don't mind having to do my business in the woods but the rain adds a whole different element of unpleasantness. Tried to at least wait out the downpour and consider my options. Didn't feel much like staying put for the day so I took advantage of a window of opportunity when it began to lighten up. Managed to pack my bag and take down the tent all underneath the rain fly for the first time. Then the skies opened up again, leaving me no choice but to trudge on. The mist shrouded out any good views I had hoped to see atop Thunder Ridge overlook, but the blossoming trillium covering either side of the path made for some great candid moments. At first it was kind of nice walking in the rain. The forest seemed all too peaceful and for once I hadn't crossed paths with a single person. That appeal faded pretty fast and I quickly began to realize why no one else was hiking. Before long my supposedly waterproof Gore-Tex Soloman boots and OR jacket were soaked inside and out, giving me chills even as I trudged uphill. By the time I got to the first shelter I was quite cold and shivering. Decided to play it safe and not continue on another 5 miles to the next shelter. We fit 8 people in a 6 person shelter so it's pretty snug. Hope I don't end up subconsciously spooning someone in the middle of the night.","Harrison Ground Spring

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533683,"The cold rainy weather dampened my motivation to get hiking this morning. Stayed curled up in my sleeping bag for the better part of it chatting with a couple of NOBO's named Illusive and Shaggy. Eventually I sucked it up, put on my cold wet rain jacket and shoes and hit the trail. It's not so bad once you get moving. Nothing like a good chill to put a little hitch in one's stride. That and the double bacon cheeseburger, family size fries and a chocolate Oreo milkshake for under $10 that awaited me at the Middle Creek Campground. Walked under the guillotine today which is basically a large rock wedged in between two boulders. Kinda neat to see. Dropped my pack off at the shelter and then slack packed .5 miles down a blue-blazed trail with Stone Age to a dirt road where we called for the free shuttle to the campground. Food was delicious and the price was right. Got some food and fuel to hold me over until Daleville, then took the shuttle back. This particular shelter holds 20 people and comes equipped with a spacious loft area and large front porch space. Very unique construction. Plenty of space to spread out all of our wet gear. Looks like I'm going to need a new water filter after some girl I loaned it to earlier misplaced the rubber gasket seal. First the squeeze bag popped and now this.

Glad I have a pair of breathable, non-waterproof trail runners to change into. Many people consider 3 pairs of footwear to be overkill (I also have a pair of crocs for camp shoes) but from my experiences, I feel it's worth it for me. Then you have people like Stone Age who don't do anything to their feet,only wear one pair of boots, and yet never get a single blister. He claims his ""secret"" is tightening the laces as tight as possible... Haha it's just not fair. Replaced all of my bandages, moleskin, and tape this morning. The ones I popped a few days back aren't nearly as painful to walk on anymore and don't show signs of infection which is a plus. The blisters on my heel, however, appear to be gaining some ground though. Yet because they're festering underneath some thick calluses I don't even have the option of lancing them. Really nice day today with the sun finally showing itself in the morning hours. It's been drawing out a good deal of lizard/salamander looking critters towards the higher elevations and as of now I've noticed at least 4 different looking species, some if which I was able to photograph. The mountain laurel is also starting to bud, following the already abundant blooms of azalea and rhododendrons'. Stone Age has been pointing out various trees, bushes, shrubs, and flowers that we see along the way. Gave him quite the startle earlier when I came up behind him growling like a bear. His eyes were as wide as silver dollars when he turned around to face me! Camped out just shy of the shelter in a nice little flat section situated right next to a creek. Had a small fire and enjoyed the peaceful night away from the increasingly crowded shelters and surrounding tent space. Thought I had my first mouse encounter tonight while I was laying down in my tent and heard something moving along the edge of the tent. My headlamp revealed a sizable bulge pushing along the walls. All my food, with the exception of a few snacks for my blood sugar, was in the bear bag so I naturally assumed it was after my late night goodies. Not wanting to wake up to it gnawing a hole into my tent, I proceeded to pummel the bulge a few times with my water bottle. Knocked the lights out of some poor frog.","Bryant Ridge Shelter

Up until now it had always been a matter of overdoing my food shopping in town (and I make it a point to eat before going grocery shopping). Had a cinnamon roll for breakfast and a few spoonfuls of peanut butter. Called home for mother's day which got me missing everyone back home whom are all gathered together today. Couldn't bring myself to ask what they were having for dinner as I sat eating my lunch which consisted of the last of the peanut butter and some sunflower seeds. Finished the remaining three snickers bars in an effort to keep my blood sugar levels up. Beautiful weather today with a mix of sun and clouds, temps no higher than 70 degrees and nice 15 mph wind blowing in from the west. In addition to checking up on the latest FOX news reports, Stone Age frequently checks the weather reports on his gizmo. So I rolled into camp with no more than a Thai soup mix for dinner, but got lucky when a guy from ME, Black Bear, offered up his cold leftover pineapple and jalapeno pizza from Pizza Hut in town. It was delicious! Camped out near the shelter and as I'm writing this something big is moving around the camp perimeter just off in the woods..","stealth camping

Nevertheless, no incidents to report thankfully. Made it into town before noon and decided to split a room at the Howard Johnson with Stone Age. This time I can at least feel entitled to changing the channel now and again and maybe broaden Stone Ages horizon. First stop in town was Wendy's, which was conveniently located right next to the grocery store. Had my fill and them some, yet I still wanted just about everything I set my eyes on in the store. Couldn't resist the maple and bacon flavored donut. Despite having planned on dinner at the Three Little Pigs BBQ, I simply couldn't stop snacking. Was going to call the Sawyer company about the filter when Stone Age miraculously found a Sawyer Mini in the hiker box at the hotel. The gasket fit perfect! Problem solved. After showering we walked down to do laundry in our rain gear. Turns out there are quite a few hikers staying here, and with only one working washer and dryer it was a bit of a wait. It was well after dark by the time we got around to leaving for dinner. Arrived at the restaurant at exactly 9:01 pm. They closed at 9 pm. Wendy's again for dinner and beer from Kroger's.

Had a few too many cups of coffee before I left and found myself stopping to take a leak around every corner. Getting into some habits out here that aren't exactly appropriate in public. Urination being #1. Whenever I'm in town I'll frequently catch myself looking for the nearest shrub or tree when the urge comes about. Then it dawns on me that I'm not in the woods anymore and there are restrooms for that. Kind of a nuisance really if you ask me. Started off at a turtles pace, using my trekking poles as crutches to support my swollen knee. Thought a day of rest would do it good but it doesn't seem any better and I'm sure that my fully stocked food bag isn't helping either. Had planned on finding a spot to camp out a good ways after the next shelter, which had been having lots of bear activity lately. As many as 5 bears have reportedly been frequenting the area, and a few hikers had their food bags stolen, and even someone's entire pack. As I ascended back up the ridgeline I was greeted with some great views of what I believe was still the James River to the West, and some dark ominous looking clouds creeping in from across the hills. For the next mile or two the ridge remained on fairly exposed, dipping in and out of slightly wooded areas. The next thing I knew the wind had picked up and the air temp noticeably dropped. Not wanting to be caught out on the exposed section in the middle of a thunderstorm, I took refuge under a small rock overhang with just enough space for me to scrunch up under. Another girl named Cinnamon came by and joined me just as the lighting bolts became visible in the sky. She saw one hit the nearby power line, and I definitely heard the loud zap as it did so. Poured and hailed for about 15 minutes, to where we were suddenly watching the trail turn into a swift moving stream. Then it was all over and the sky brightened up as if someone had just flicked a switch. Hiked until about 7:30 pm until my knee had had enough. Found a secluded flat spot to the side of the trail and made camp. Very foggy and eerie looking night. Noticing a lot of weird ""spider cricket's"" between my tent and the rain fly. They have 6 long cricket type legs and can jump surprisingly far. Thankfully none got in the tent with me (that I know of anyhow).","Pearisburg

Made it to tinker cliffs by noon and took a nice long lunch there soaking in all of the beauty before me. Could even see McAfee Knob a few miles away. An hour or so down the trail the sky suddenly darkened and the wind picked up again. In a matter of minutes it began to all out pour. I could hear it coming through the trees in full force, but with nowhere to take shelter I decided to stay put until it had passed. By the time it was over I was drenched through my rain gear once again. Started walking and came upon the shelter only a few hundred feet away..

McAfee Knob was only .7 miles away and Stone Age was supposed to be meeting his wife in the afternoon, so we couldn't wait around all day. Unfortunately, the fog never lifted but still got some good photos at the famous ledge. There'll be plenty of good views to come anyhow so I'm not all that disappointed. Met Stone Ages' lovely wife Pam, down in the parking lot, and then continued on my way to Four Pines Hostel. The tell-tale signs of another afternoon storm came soon after leaving the parking lot. Put on my pack cover, rain jacket, and even my rain pants. Nevertheless within minutes, the gore-Tex became saturated and began leaking through. I was also beginning to sweat so I decided to stay put and wait it out off to the side of the trail under the limited tree cover. The wind pelted me with hail anywhere from the size of blueberries to golf balls cut in half. Within 15-20 minutes the worst of it had passed. The trail was slick and muddy but on the bright side the forest looked so lush and vibrant. Emerged from the woods and found myself in a big grassy meadow walking alongside a herd of cattle. Saw a few tempting areas to camp alongside the stream I had been following, but the thought of free soda and freeze pops kept me going to the hostel. Hardly had time to settle in before getting shuttled to the Homeplace Restaurant for dinner. Very popular spot that serves all you can eat family style meals and is only open Thursday to Sunday in the afternoon. Many consider it to be the best place to eat on the entire trail but I'll be the judge of that. Got a table with a few other hikers and went to town on fried chicken, BBQ pulled pork, beef, ham, etc. Their were so many food platters it became like a Tetris game fitting them all on the table. No sooner had we cleared one plate then the waitress would bring another. I had nearly forgotten how it felt to be over stuffed. One of the gentleman who sat with us was on his way to the Trail Days celebration in Damascus, VA to reconnect with some people he knew from his thru hike years ago. When it came time for the bill the waitress informed us that he had already taken care of it. Really nice guy.

The climb up was a bit challenging at certain parts, but not nearly as difficult as everyone hyped it up to be. Sure there were some rock scrambles and steep climbs towards the top that got a bit technical I guess, but not to the extent that people had made it out to be. Just wait until they get to NH and ME.

It stayed pretty cool and windy all day, especially up on the few mile stretch of exposed ridge-line. The terrain had me walking sideways on slanted rock slabs and carefully picking my way around the narrow rock corridors. Almost never had flat footing throughout that section, but the views sure were gorgeous. There were also these white flowering bushes in the foreground that gave off the most pleasant aroma. Gonna have to ask Stone Age what they are. Also crossed the Eastern Continental Divide today. Water sources were few and far between today so I elected to descend the steep .4 miles downhill to the shelter which is situated close to a spring. I ventured down the trail, past the spring , and stumbled upon some really interesting log cabin ruins. A stone chimney was all that remained standing of one structure. Only one other guy at the shelter, Uconn, who just so happens to be from Danbury CT. It was a nice shelter with the roof extended well past the shelter to cover the picnic table out front.

So I cooked up some instant rice to carry with me in case my blood sugar dipped low while I was hiking; which it inevitably did before long. Had added some Thai seasoning packet that looked good in the store yet tasted awful. After forcing the last of it down on the way into town, I got some much appreciated trail magic in the form of a few snacks and a whey protein bar from two NOBOs coming out of town. Wish I could remember there names, but I ironically forgot to write them down afterwards in my rush to get into town. Gotta start keeping a small notebook of sorts and a pen in my hip pocket for such instances. Hasn't rained since last night so I was in a pretty good mood on my way into town. I further amused myself by greeting NOBOs in various accents along the way. Found it hard to keep up my some of them though the few times I unexpectedly got dragged into a conversation. Anyhow, I hitched my way into Pearisburg and met up with Stone Age at the Chinese Buffet. The food was decent but not in comparison to the famous Ming's in Waynesboro, VA. I still fantasize about it from time to time. Tried not to overdo it with my resupply, seeing as I'll be meeting up with Christina in a few short days, but its hard to buy to find small quantities of many items, and when there's a sale for something you want anyways, (like buy one one free bagels) you'd be a fool to not take advantage. That's the McGinley (mothers side of the family) in me I suppose. Too bad Stone Age and I don't like as many of the same things.

The air felt cool and crisp and I soon found myself hitting a pretty good stride despite the extremely muddy conditions. For every step I took I'd find myself sliding half a step back. Really nasty stuff. Nevertheless, I was surprised to find myself only a few miles shy of Trent's Grocery by the time I stopped for lunch. Now I understand the term ""pink blazing"" that I heard from someone recently. As I unpacked my lunch I noticed a few holes in my Frito's bag. Apparently I received an unexpected visitor last night while I was sleeping. I unconsciously left my tent door ajar after waking up to go to the bathroom last night and a mouse must've found his way in and had his way with my Frito's. Funny and lucky that all he wanted was my Frito's though. Guess I've been getting too used to merely unzipping a few fly's and never having to leave the comfort of my bed when the urge strikes during the night. Benefits of having a two person tent with two doors! Had a nice long lunch by the stream as I found out Christina and Shannon wouldn't be here until 4pm anyhow. As such, we decided it would be best to camp at Trent's tonight and set off sometime tomorrow. Having gotten there a few hours before them, I first and foremost was to get myself a double bacon cheeseburger with fries for second lunch. Figured I'd see what the two of them were bringing for food before resupplying, so I went ahead and got my tent set up and everything beforehand. The tenting area was a few hundred feet down this gravel farm road, in a clearing by the river, that had been sectioned off from the farm and horses with a fence. Pretty open, communal sort of camping area equipped with somewhat grungy facilities but also set amidst a dozen or so condemned looking trailer homes and rotting picnic tables. Yet it made for a convenient meeting spot and quite frankly there was nothing else around. Trent's seems to be the local stop for anything from hardware, groceries, hot food, ammunition, traps, and everything in-between. Had a nice feel to the place and the staff were extraordinarily friendly. Could've been the stuffed animals and fish on display that did it for me, but the food itself is worth the stop. It's not often that we get the opportunity for a hot, greasy meal between town stops and this was certainly worth the half a mile detour down the road. It's also not everyday that I get to see my beautiful English girlfriend either, so after establishing camp I immediately hopped in the shower and got cleaned up. They arrived just as I finished. Can't even put into words how good it was to see the two of them. Christina couldn't get out of the car fast enough. It immediately felt like we were right back to where we left off in March when she left to go back home to England. Didn't take long for all of the goodies to come out and boy am I sure being spoiled! To save time, I'll just say beer and Christina's amazing shortbread were the highlights. She made 6 batches! I love that woman... Introduced her and Shannon to Stone Age and Mc'Lovin, whom I had met outside Trent's. The rain held off until later in the evening, right about the time Christina began making chicken quesadillas for dinner. Thankfully Shannon had a tarp which we extended out from the trunk and pitched with a few zip ties, trekking poles and stakes. She proved herself a true Subaru owner, despite what I may have said at the time without thinking... Car camping turned out to be a very good decision after all.

He works at the REI near where I live and gave me some of the best advice for my trip. Had a nice leisurely morning and started hiking just after noon. Spirits were high and the terrain was quite moderate so we set off at a pretty good pace. Caught up to Stone Age a few miles down the trail and we all camped together next to a quaint little stream.

Shannon took the liberty of toasting our bagels over the embers which was a nice touch. Took our time leaving camp and must've seen about a dozen hikers pass by before we ourselves hit the trail. Some of them complemented our fire, and I'm sure all of them were a tad jealous. If only we had some bacon and eggs to fry up. Not long after setting off we began looking for a spot to stop for lunch. Yet we resisted the hunger and persisted on a few miles. Took our time eating as we gorged on wraps filled with hummus, sausage, cheese, Frito's and jalapeno chips. Had some carrots and cucumber smothered in hummus and a few shortbread for dessert. Best lunch on the trail yet! Also reached somewhat of a milestone today at the 600 mile market for the trail. For me it represents how far I have left on my Southern section of trail. It wasn't mentioned in my guidebook but Christina spotted the stones someone had arranged to spell out 600! just off to the side of the trail. Took a bunch of pictures only to later find a second 600 marker a few miles away. I guess the trail changed since the first one was made, but either way I got plenty of pictures at both. Pretty easy walking on the ridge-line today. Quite dull though with no views or abundance of wildlife or even a change in the vegetation as we went. Lots of gypsy moth caterpillars though, lowering themselves down from the trees with a strand of webbing. The three of us kept changing who was leading and thus who was clearing the webs ahead as we hiked on. Ended up staying near the shelter but were still able to find a quiet spot away from everyone else that had congregated there. Had another little fire and ""hit the hay"" soon after dark. Besides a few scattered showers in the evening we were fortunate to have had great weather all day.","stealth camping

Skipped the fire in an effort to get an early start. Hiked an easy 2 miles to the road leading into Bland, VA and called for a shuttle back to Shannon's car. Ran into Stone Age at the intersection and said our goodbye's. Picked up some beer at Trent's and made the short drive to Dismal Falls where we spent a few hours enjoying the gorgeous weather. Despite its name, Dismal Falls proved to be a small, but beautiful waterfall with a nice pool at the bottom. Shannon was daring enough to jump from the the top of the falls, but the water was far too cold for me. Got a room at the Comfort Inn in Dublin, VA for the night and had an amazing dinner at Ted's Steakhouse. It was a nice break from Wendy's and all you can eat buffet's. I even got dressed up for the occasion (pictures to come haha).","

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538549,"Surprised to have had such a nice campsite all to myself last night. I think most NOBOs stopped at the first spot they came across just a little ways away from where I had set up. A lot of times you never know if you're going to come by another camping area or not, so it can be advantageous to take what you find when you find it. But then when you start walking the next day, 9 times out of 10 there's a better spot just a short distance away that you missed. So if I get to camp early enough I'll usually drop my pack and walk down the trail a bit to scope out whats ahead. My new shoes that I got a size bigger seem to be working out better for me, but still not yet sure that they're the answer to my foot problems. I've only been wearing them the last five days so only time will tell. Eventually I'd like to be able to send my Salomon boots home and just hike in trail runner's, but I'm apprehensive about ditching them too soon in case my sneakers fail me. Had a delicious lunch today with miscellaneous food rolled up into a tortilla. Pretty much everyone out here carries tortilla's as they are quite versatile. I've seen some interesting combinations of things wrapped up in them, but some might say I took it too far today (don't hate it until you try it though). Step 1: Smear Reese's spread over half of the tortilla. Step 2: Add a layer of cheese slices of your preference (I used extra sharp Cabot that was leftover from Christina and Shannon's visit). Step 3: Sprinkle heavily with jalapeno crisps and top off with crushed Frito's. Step 4: Fold tortilla best you can and enjoy over a bowl/crumbcatcher of some form. Sounds bizarre but just thinking about it is making me hungry again. Lucked out again in finding a nice quiet camp to have to myself. Water sources have been few and far between lately so you can usually expect to find people congregated around them at the days end. However, I decided to venture down an unmaintained blue-blaze trail that I came to just before the water source I had planned to camp around. A few hundred yards down the trail I came to a great camping spot in a nice open field. Came fully equipped with a fire pit, plenty of firewood, and a spring nearby. Made good use of the fire pit and fell asleep to the sky littered with stars and the sound of owls hooting around me.","

Plus it's nice to get started off early before the temperature rises and the humidity sets in. My shirt has been getting soaked through with sweat and I can hardly see out of my glasses after not even an hour of walking. Threw together another couple of wraps like I had done yesterday, only this time I upped the ante and added some crushed Oreos. Really hit the spot. Somehow, I unexpectedly ended up taking a nap right after lunch and woke up maybe an hour or two later I would guess. Ran into an older gentleman at the shelter who calls himself Green Briar. He showed me how to prepare a salad from fresh greens that are abundant along the trail. Now I just need to pack out some dressing packets and bacon bits. Ended the day with a nice touch of trail magic. The guy and his daughter, Ducky started the trail together but he had sustained an injury shortly after and now follows his daughter from place to place and provides hot dogs, hamburgers, snacks and sodas for other hikers that come along. Had planned to go a few miles further but with good food and good people nearby, I decided that this spot was as good as any.

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538551,"Went to say goodbye to everyone I had met last night and was unexpectedly treated to a second breakfast of pancakes and sausage. Left camp with a new hiking partner, Bear, who is an 8 month old lab and some mountain dog mix. He had followed some people into camp yesterday after his owner let him off his leash. Yet the owner never showed up, so instead of someone having to wait behind for him, I took Bear with me to intercept him. Extremely friendly and sweet dog, but still young and untrained. With only a section of paracord for a leash, my hand soon grew sore from being dragged around after every squirrel, chipmunk, and deer we encountered. It was nice having Bear to propel me up the hills though, once we hit a good stride. The fence rails proved to be a bit tricky though. After a few slow miles Bear was finally reunited with his owner, Tuna Splatter. I must admit it was rather nice having him as a companion for just those few miles. Made me miss my dog Mattie. Kinda looked like her too; all black with a white patch on his chest. Got hotter as the day went on and I was sweating ""more than a whore in church"" (as Heavy D would say). Met a couple of locals out for the weekend who generously shared their moonshine with me. They were quite interesting to talk to. True rednecks, unlike many of my classmates from Granby High School who considered themselves to be hick because they suddenly started wearing Carhart clothing and driving lifted trucks. Also came across the quarter way point sign today; although technically it'll be another dozen or so more miles for me.","stealth camping

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542636,"Woke up to the pitter patter of rain drops falling on my tent. Cleared up soon after I started hiking but it was just enough to get my feet nice and wet as I walked through the long grass amongst the grazing cows. Had to skirt around one of them that was on the trail leaving a minefield of cow pies behind it. The trail took me straight through Atkins, VA where I stopped at the Exxon station. Ended up spending more time there than I had ever thought one could bother to spend outside a gas station. In my defense they did offer free wifi for hikers. I was even put in charge of the store (so to speak) when the owner needed to leave for 15-20 minutes. Was very tempted to go to the all you cam eat buffet at The Barn Restaurant right across the street but ultimately decided to forgo it. Turned out for the best though. Not long after leaving Atkins I came upon The Settlers Museum of SW VA. According to the sign on the door they didn't open for another hour so I walked around the property a bit and sat in the pavilion to read the pamphlet and charge some electronics. As I eventually made my way back to the trailhead I noticed something that wasn't there 20 minutes ago. A truck was parked in front of the restored 1894 schoolhouse and a family of 3 were setting up to grill underneath a big blue canopy they had erected. The parents, Jeff and Tammy and their daughter Bailey informed me that they were fixing to have a hiker feast on behalf of the West End United Methodist Church, and I was more than welcome to stick around for the food to come. Within the next half hour an additional 20 or more people showed up from the congregation, bringing with them all sorts of home cooked meals, sides, desserts, drinks, and lots of watermelon. It was quite the spread! Must've been enough food there to feed some 50 or so hikers, but yet only myself and maybe 5 or 6 others came by. Kinda ironic given the amount of people I have been seeing on the trail lately. Yet, as Pastor Richard said, ""it's about the quality, not the quantity."" I tried my best to make up for the lack in quantity of hikers but eventually I reached the bottom of my seemingly endless pit of a stomach. I had spent the last four hours eating and socializing with all sorts of wonderful people. Day well spent. Was there from when they first set up shop to the time they packed up to leave. Really great community of people. They even fill the school with bins of trail magic consisting of food, fruit, sodas, and a collection of useful resupply items from toiletry items to batteries. As a whole, this was by far the best trail magic I've encountered. Had to loosen my hip belt straps a bit to get them to clip, and even then I was so full it was a struggle to move about. Decided to spend the night there at the schoolhouse and was joined by another girl, Swiss Miss, from Switzerland. Later that evening the two of us explored the 67 acre farm and its outbuildings. Definitely not your typical museum, but nevertheless an interesting piece of history that takes you back to simpler times in the culture developed by the first settlers to that area. It was looking to be a gorgeous night so I decided to forgo the shelter of the schoolhouse and my tent, electing to sleep under the stars instead.","

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542668,"Quite a bit of dew collected on my sleeping bag this morning, but after such a brilliant sky to fall asleep under and a beautiful morning sun to wake up to, I'm certainly not complaining. Forgot that I had crammed some cookies down in my boots and some lucky mouse had his way with them inside. Packed out a few treats from the box's of trail magic left by the church and left a message of gratitude in the logbook. Believe it or not someone from the church comes by at least every other day to restock the supply with anything from daily hiker items one might need to replace to snack upon snacks, soda, jars of peanut butter and celery sticks, and even dog food. Truly remarkable. Ended my day at the Partnership Shelter where I had originally planned to be yesterday. One of the great things about being out here is that there is no schedule to follow. Many times I just start my day without even looking at the guide and see where the day takes me. To be open to whatever the day might bring and not having a set plan can be truly freeing. I strive to cherish every moment and make the most of my time out here. I'm lucky enough not to have a deadline requiring me to crank out high mile days. So sometimes I'll stop and ask myself, ""what's the rush?"" The Shelter was everything I had heard it was. This was like the Taj Mahal of shelters, all log construction, with a sizable loft and even a shower had been built in. Apparently there's warm water in the warmer months but it was ice cold for me. You could even call for pizza delivery to the shelter from the phone outside the Mt. Rogers visitor center. I made the short walk to look around the visitor center and then caught a ride into the town of Marion, VA to resupply. Ate dinner at Subway and then had second dinner at Wendy's which I passed on my way to the bar, Marcado's. I'll admit to being a bit of a hop head sure, but it's not often that I go out to a bar. However, this particular evening I just felt like going out for a beer or two. Ended up getting a pitcher which kept me there much later than I had anticipated. It was around 10:30 pm by the time I left, and there were hardly any cars on the road. Walked a few miles with my headlamp until someone eventually stopped to pick me up and drove me back the last 5 miles.","Settlers Museum

Had to hitch back into town just to get cell phone service so that I could properly address a few pieces of mail. It also just happened to be the 50th Anniversary at Mt. Roger's visitor center, and I couldn't help but take part in some of the festivities. Listened to some live folk music and then indulged my sweet tooth with some cake. As I made my way back to pack, I got hung up talking to another hiker named Square Peg. One thing led to another and the next thing I knew I was having a beer with him. Soon after another group of hikers arrived back from town with snacks to share. I contributed my Chips Ahoy cookies and the feast was on! Square Peg and I created the ultimate cookie dubbed the ""triple crowner."" It requires 2 double stuf Oreos and 1 Chips Ahoy Cookie of your choosing (I prefer the original). Carefully separate both Oreos in half and eat the halves without the cream (if done properly). Using the remaining halves, create a sandwich with the Chips Ahoy cookie in the middle and enjoy. You're welcome world. Day well spent for sure but it was getting late and I was feeling anxious to get going so as not to get stuck in the ""vortex"" that has kept people here for as long as 9 days. Didn't make it far at all before the stays in my knee brace started to dig into my already bruised leg. The stitching that holds the plastic hinges in place to either side of my leg has popped on one side and the hard plastic has been digging into my muscle for the past few days.

In an effort to gauge roughly where I am amiss ""the bubble"" I'm going to take a tally of all the thru hikers I pass every other day. Something to keep me occupied during the day anyhow. Had a nice long lunch at the Trimpi Shelter and met some great people. An older gentleman, Stan (aka low gear) whom I had met a few days prior offered to treat me to what he said would be ""the best BBQ I'd have on the trail."" I couldn't resist. It's like a predator luring a little child into his van with promises of candy. But this was my second encounter with Stan, and both times we had a pleasant chat and he was nice enough to share his oreos and Gatorade with me. He's completed some 1300 miles on the AT thus far and is preparing to spend a few weeks hiking the trail with a friend starting in NJ. Being from around the area he's been parking at various intersections along the trail and hiking out and back with his bag. Just a really nice guy who's actually known around town for his kindness towards hikers. I enjoyed his company and cannot say enough good things about the BBQ sandwich I had at the general store in W. Jefferson, VA. Whether or not it's the best on the trail remains to be determined. Got back on the trail feeling pretty good, did a few more miles and called it a day. It's been looking like rain all afternoon but at least now I'm in the comfort of my tent with a semi full stomach.

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542718,"Another clear morning and a nice early start on the trail. There's something very calming about hiking in the early morning. The first rays of sun coming through the trees, birds chirping, and few people on the trail. It's also nice and cool which makes a big difference in my level of energy throughout the day. Got talking to a few too many people on the trail, at the shelter, and everywhere in between. Met some really nice folks from all over the US and Canada. Even encountered a group of old order Mennonites along the way. Didn't write down any of their names though and I've met so many people since then that its hard to recall back so far. Had originally planned on staying just outside the Grayson Highlands State Park (GHSP), but when I came to the spot known as The Scales I simply couldn't pass it by. It was an old livestock corral nestled in between 2 small peaks with a gorgeous view of the distant rolling hills. At over 5,000' in elevation this was where ranchers would weigh and sell their cattle to fetch a higher price. This came about after years of lost profit in attempting to drive the cattle down into town for sale. The arduous journey took the lives of many livestock, and those that did survive yielded a lower price after losing a significant amount of weight on the way. Just as I finished setting up my tent in the field it began to rain. I quickly took refuge under the awning outside of the bathrooms (yes, bathrooms). It was a great spot to sit and watch as the storm rolled in with a vengeance. Before long it had passed by and the dispersed cloud cover made for an excellent sunset. Got my first look at the wild ponies that roam the highlands. A few of them had made there way over to the corral to graze a bit before night set in. They're about the size of a miniature horse, only a little bigger and come in a variety of patterns and colors. I read somewhere that they're more or less semi wild ponies that were introduced years ago to help maintain the vast, open landscape of the highlands. It's kind of a neat, natural initiative really. Can't wait to walk amongst them tomorrow. Watched one of the baby ponies attempt to play with one of the bigger ponies as it ran around all giddy in circles, trying desperately to get the older mare to chase it. After my entertainment left I proceeded to fall asleep to the blissful noises of nothing but nature around me.","

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543420,"The sun brought an array of colors to the horizon early this morning. Still can't believe I had this whole place to myself last night. My tent was pretty wet from the rain and morning dew, but it was nothing that 15 minutes in the sun and brisk breeze couldn't fix. As I was packing up my things (the worst daily task in my opinion) I turned around and found myself staring right at a longhorn cow. We looked at one another for a minute or so until he turned photo shy on me. So technically the AT only goes through the GHSP for a couple of miles, but yet the landscape remained the same and the ponies were present miles before and after the official boundary. It's so hard to describe in detail the gorgeous scenery and overall beauty that surrounded me today and do it justice. I will, however, say that it was definitely the highlight of my journey thus far. The first of two groups of ponies I encountered seemed so unbothered by the presence of humans that it almost seemed as if they were ignoring us. That is until I made the mistake of putting my backpack down. As soon as I did so, one particularly confrontational pony immediately quit grazing and abruptly trotted right up to me. Guess he figured I may have something better to offer than the grass he had been consumed by. A firm ""whoa"" stopped him just shy of my outstretched hand. He looked me over for a minute, decided it wasn't worth it, and went back to consuming grass. Other than that one incident, none of the ponies paid much attention to me or the volley of camera shutters and flashes. Ran into a lot of day hikers, a few of whom I stopped and talked to for a bit. It was nice to have other people to take pictures with me in them, but it usually involved a conversation. Not that I mind socializing with the general public or anything, but if I stopped to talk to everyone I encountered I'd never get anywhere. The second herd of ponies was much larger than the first numbering a dozen or so at least and were dispersed to either side of the trail. Four of the young ponies were sprawled out in the grass just to the side of the trail in a deep sleep. Their eyes were closed and one of then that I stopped to watch was twitching in his sleep. Reminded me of my dog Mattie who twitches and occasionally ""runs"" in her comatose state. Walking through the Grayson Highlands felt like a scene out of Lord of the Rings; the wide open grassy landscape scattered with rocks and shrubs where wild ponies roam free and abounding views of the surrounding mountains as far as the eye can see. Simply breathtaking. Assisted a woman from the Forestry Department in moving some heavy logs that people had formed around an undesignated campsite. ""Cleaning up from the craziness of Labor Day weekend"" she said. As I proceeded down the trail I saw the aftermath firsthand; campsite after campsite for the next half a mile or so. Ended up at the prettiest spot tonight, right on the side of the ridge looking out at the expansive scenery before me. Even had a spring on site, but no trees in which to hang a bear bag so I'm sleeping with my food tonight. Watched the sunset from the comfort of my sleeping bag and then found myself surrounded by mice that had come out in the cover of darkness. They made a jungle gym out of my boots laying just outside of my screen door. Should be okay as long as I don't leave the door unzipped again.","The Scales

Definitely the best morning to date. It's Christina's Birthday today and despite the remarkable start to the day I'm feeling a bit bummed out that I can't be there to celebrate with her. And of all days not to have service! It was all downhill from there, literally. Dropped a few thousand feet in a couple of miles which took a toll on my knee. Came up behind a group of boys scouts which kept me from stopping for too long so as to keep ahead. It was the first time I've ever had to pass people going the same direction, and I was not intent on flip flopping with a caravan of scouts all day. The sky darkened as the cloud cover set in later in the afternoon, and not long after you could hear the wall of heavy rain moving through the valley just below. Not wanting the boy scouts to get ahead, I had passed up the sign marking the turnoff to the shelter. However when the raindrops first started coming down I started to regret my decision. Luckily there just so happened to be a second spur trial a short distance away which I cruised down just in time. The scouts were not all so lucky and came in some twenty or so minutes later wringing water out of their socks. After about an hour the sky cleared up and the sun was shining once again. The trail merged with the Virginia Creeper Trail for a mile or so, the end of which I received a bit of 'star status' as I came around a corner to a large group of bikers looking my way and cheering. At first I was a bit taken back but then one of them yelled above the applause something about ""for the hiker..."" So naturally I began playing along with a few bows of thanks. Turns out they were cheering on the last member of their group who happened to be directly behind me. Felt kinda foolish after that whole ordeal.

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543460,"Kept on raining last night and into this morning, but with only five miles to Damascus, VA I wasn't the least bit deterred. One of the great things about the AT is the overwhelming support and selflessness of the people and communities that surround it. The things that so many of these folks do out of pure kindness for complete strangers like myself is absolutely astounding. It's the reason why many thru hikers return to hike the trail again and again. Of all of the great hiker friendly communities there are along the AT, none are as renowned as that of Damascus, VA. Located on the border of TN, Damascus is known best for hosting the largest event on the AT called Trail Days. From what I could surmise it's a massive gathering of hikers that are mostly interested in partying their asses off for three straight days. It's also a big reunion with talent shows, presentations, music, contra dancing, etc. While this was taking place I enjoyed the peace and quiet on the trail while it was taking place earlier this month. Anyhow, it stopped raining as I cruised into town on the Creeper Trail (another attraction to the area for bikers). Felt good knowing that I had the whole day to relax in town. I was immediately bombarded with all sorts of tempting smells and advertisements for breakfast food, Hershey's ice cream and homemade fudge (just to name a few). Somehow I was able to force myself past them although I did not stop for coffee at Moe's which I had heard great things about. Next stop was Crazy Larry's Hostel, where I picked up my package and inevitably ended up spending the night. I didn't find him to be all that crazy, but rather quite a nice guy. Met some really great people staying there as well (Amber and Chuck Brewer, Joe, Mike - Trans America bike tour) and one guy, Mongo, offered to drive me to the supermarket and save me the two mile trek there and back. Relaxed in the backyard and treated myself with a 6 pack of 8 point IPA's from Devil's Backbone Brewery. Surprised to find that I still didn't have cell phone service in town, but a fellow hiker, Joe, told me that he had picked up a bar while sitting on the picnic table to the side of the gas station down the street.

The AT actually goes through the center of town, and thus passes right by the outfitters. Made the mistake of weighing my pack on the hanging scale while I was there. As soon as it was up on the hook the needle shot way down and then settled at 62 lbs. The guy working there seemed as shocked as I was. He turned to me with his hand extended and said, ""I'd like to shake your hand."" Apparently in the last couple of years he's worked there my pack weighed in as one of the heaviest. In my defense I do eat A LOT. Ended up purchasing a smaller size hip belt, as mine is cinched up almost as tight as it will allow. They even heated it up in the oven and molded it to my hips. Hopefully it'll conform to my bony structure and eliminate some of the friction that has been rubbing my hips raw lately. Just a few miles past town was a most welcoming sight; the VA/TN state line! I could hardly contain my excitement as I gave out a loud 'whoop' upon seeing the sign. While I've most certainly enjoyed my time in VA, it's a great feeling of accomplishment having gone through the longest stretch of the trail in any one state. Can't wait for all that is to come, especially the Smokies. Lightened my load of the 2 beers I had carried with me up the mountain and ate way more than I should have.

Only snapped one half of the sides that tucks behind my ears, so I was able to tuck the one end under my hat to somewhat hold them on my head, although they would inevitably end up lopsided as I began hiking. Since crossing the TN border I've noticed a few changes around me. For instance the vegetation seems to have become much more lush and is encroaching on the trail. Unless I start wearing long pants I'm afraid that poison ivy is inevitable. In some places on the trail the poison ivy is so abundant and overgrown that I have to keep my walking sticks at my side so as to act as a buffer.

It was really neat to be looking at a completely different scene of the same view I had been admiring only yesterday. I continued to catch glimpses of the lake as I proceeded down the mountain. Once I got down to the water it was relatively easy going. Such a pretty section with great camping around the shore, it's a shame that they had to close the shelter and surrounding camping areas due to aggressive bear activity. Apparently it was reopened earlier this year after a 2 year closure, but almost immediately closed shortly after. The signs posted around the area warn hikers to keep moving without stopping throughout the entire 4 mile stretch around the lake. At the far West end of the lake was a busy public beach called the Shook Branch Recreation area. Lots of families and screaming kids enjoying the nice day so I went and found myself a quiet, shady spot off to the side to have lunch and watch the geese and ducks for awhile. After crossing the busy road and walking up the private gravel drive on the opposite side I came across a flyer for a new hostel that had opened up just this year. I was planning on going a few more miles to another well known hostel on the trail, but something about this place simply drew me in. It was a 3 minute walk further down the road, the prices were more than reasonable and they also offered free shuttles into town. Furthermore, it had gotten pretty hot out and I still had a long PUD (pointless up and down) between me and my destination. My mind was made up pretty quick. A couple of dogs made my presence known as I walked up the driveway where I was greeted by Joe (the owner), Jordan (assistant) and Neil (man of may trades). Joe took me on a tour of the property and talked of his big ideas for developing it further. Neil had already converted one of the outbuildings into a 'one of a kind' bunk room which resembled the sleeping quarters on a train car. Each bunk had a light with an outlet, comfortable cushions, and different colored curtains that illuminated the room with an array of colors when lit up at night. Overall beautiful piece of property with lots of potential. Paid $5 to tent out and another $5 for dinner. Best $10 I ever spent. Had shish kabob for dinner which we all helped in stacking the skewers full of chicken, peppers, onions, mushrooms, squash and zucchini. Felt almost like I was at home. Went to bed with a full stomach under the open sky littered with stars. Hope it doesn't rain tonight!","Vandeventer Shelter

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543498,"Today was kind of a weird day. Was off to a great start with pancakes, sweet rolls and fruit for breakfast courtesy of Joe. Continued looking for my portable power stick that I had misplaced last night and ultimately found it in the bottom of my dry bag after going through it for the third time. Then, upon checking my blood sugar I found my levels to be 'through the roof' so I stuck around while waiting for the insulin to take effect. Probably had something to do with all of the regular sugar I used in my coffee and forgot to account for. An hour went by, then two and yet my blood sugar was still unusually high. After awhile the insulin finally kicked in, but I soon found myself having to eat something as my levels had now dropped far too low. The ""seesaw"" effect as I call call it. Decided to take a zero day and walked down to the lake for some R&R. Watched the baby dos and geese until some little brat chased them off while throwing sticks and sand at them. Was hoping to see the geese turn on him but unfortunately they just retreated. Made it back to Boots Off just in time for dinner. Didn't think it would be possible for them to exceed last nights meal, especially having gone from feeding just two guests to now 7/8, but this particular meal was hands down the best I've had in the last couple of months. For the main dish he had cooked up a massive fillet of salmon garnished with cranberry sauce around the side and lime wedges down the middle and there was also plenty of red potatoes and vegetables to go around. Neil is a master chef. Just like Christina, he makes it look so easy and taste incredible. I'm beginning to think it has something to do with them both being from England. After dinner a group of ten or so boy scouts showed up unexpectedly and the peace and quiet was gone. Left the rainfly off again and slept out under the stars right next to a patch of overgrown meadow, abounding with fireflies. Didn't get to fully enjoy it though as the scouts kept tripping the motion detector light near me as they walked by.","Boots Off Hostel & Campground

Neil was nice enough to sew it back on for me. Made sure to limit my coffee intake and before long I was back on the trail. Had such a nice stay at Boots Off and hope to come back one day to visit and see what they've done with the place. Even with all of the work to be done, Joe and Neil still made it a point to sit and talk with you for awhile, making you feel right at home. Just really great people. As I made my way up the hill I began thinking about the cold lake that I had left behind. Luckily I found myself a nice refreshing river to cool off in once I came down the hill. Took a nice long lunch, stripped down to my underwear and sat at the top of the rock slab in the middle of the river and let the water flow down and around my legs. Further upstream was Laurel Falls; a 60-80' waterfall that attracted a good deal of day hikers. The trail coming out of the falls was like an extreme stair master, and yet I kept seeing all too many people attempting it in flip flops and with little kids who were at eye level with many of the rock steps. Hung out with Wizard, Bob and Gandalf at the watering hole for quite awhile before making my way up yet another hill to find a pot to camp for the night.","Boots Off Hostel & Campground

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543506,"Met a fellow SOBO hiker (Prometheus) at the next shelter while having second lunch. it was the first true SOBO thru hiker I've met, and yet I knew that I'd never see him again He was trying to make it from Damascus, VA to Erwin, TN (some 120 miles) in 5 days. All the power to him. After lunch I ventured down another side trail to Jones Falls which didn't sound all that impressive from afar, but was surprisingly beautiful and not nearly as crowded as Laurel Falls had been. In fact, I was alone for the entire 20 minutes or so that I spent there. Haven't seen very many people on the trail today which has been kind of nice. Later in the afternoon as I was walking along deep in my own thoughts, two SOBO hikers (Mountain Goat and Lorax) gave me the biggest scare of my life coming quietly around a blind turn in the path. I'll admit to being a rather jumpy person on occasion (especially when I'm daydreaming) but this instance trumped all others. I guess I was just so lost in my own little world after not having seen anyone for a good long time until they suddenly appeared ahead of me and merely remarked ""hey"" to get my attention. It was enough to snap me back into reality as I let out a loud ""WHOOOAA"" and jumped a good foot or two in the air. The two of them could not stop laughing about it afterwards. Lorax claimed that this would forever be one of the stories he would tell people who asked him about his experience. Not sure if thats necessarily a good thing or not but at least I left a lasting impression on someone.","stealth camping

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543508,"Yet another remarkable day both on and off the trail. Found myself a hitch into Roan Mtn., TN this morning where I got a few things at the market to hold me over for the next few days. The guy who drove me in was really nice and even gave me a water bottle out of his cooler. Would've preferred one of the cold beers I observed in his cooler, but beggars can't be choosers. Did my best to resist the urge for some town food at the well known Bob's Dairyland, but the temptation was too strong. I had heard a lot of people rave about their burgers and now here I was just across the street from it. When I went up to order I was told by the cashier that my meal had already been paid for. It didn't take me long to figure out who had done such an exceptionally kind and unsolicited deed. The older gentleman, Robert, and his daughter Diana had just ordered ahead of me and I had noticed him leaning in to whisper something to the cashier, but thought nothing of it at the time. I immediately went over to thank them and proceeded to sit at the adjacent table so as to chat and eat alongside them. Robert had been born and raised in the surrounding mountains and had a good deal of interesting stories and recollections from times past. His daughter Diana was just as sweet and offered to drive me back up to the trailhead after lunch. She insisted that I take their uneaten biscuits with me, which she wrapped in napkins and sealed in a zip-loc bag along with some jam. Crossed the TN/NC border at Doll Flats later in the afternoon and decided to call it an early day so as to spend the night atop Hump Mtn. which offered a gorgeous panoramic view from the grassy bald. Another family was already set up and playing UNO when I arrived. I was really hoping to have the spot all to myself, which sounds selfish of me now that I say it, but they were extremely friendly and easy to talk to. The father even offered to make me dinner which was extremely welcome. It may have only been Ramon noodles, but having someone else prepare me a meal out here is quite the luxury.

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543509,"Managed to wake up just before the sunrise without even setting an alarm. Watched the sun creep up the horizon from behind the distant mountain range from the comfort of my sleeping bag and with a warm cup of coffee in hand. Just when I thought that things couldn't be any more perfect, the silhouette of a doe popped into view a few dozen yards away. The contrast of her dark figure in front of the increasingly intense colors preceding the sun made for an awe-inspiring moment. Of course, within that short window of opportunity I couldn't manage to locate my camera amongst everything I had strewn about around me. But I can still close my eyes and vividly recall that moment from memory. It was quite chilly last night and into this morning but before long I was back down to shorts and a t-shirt as the day quickly heated up. Hung out with Cowboy, Barefoot and Sparrow (collectively known as the Squelch Watch) for awhile. They introduced me to their upper body workout routine called Crazy 8's. Not long after parting ways I found myself venturing down another side trail to Overmountain Shelter. It was pretty unique in that it had been erected back in the 1800s and since restored and maintained by a group of volunteers who made it into an AT shelter. Between the 2 levels it supposedly sleeps at least 20 people and looks out to a pleasant view in between the mountain peaks. My next detour on Grassy Ridge took me over half a mile to the most spectacular sight. The Rhododendron and flaming azaleas are currently in bloom here and the hillsides around this particular stretch in the Roan Mtn. range are covered in patches of brilliant orange and pink color. And because the surrounding mountaintops and ridges are maintained as grassy balds makes the colors stand out that much more. Sure you can see some of the blooming bushes in patches along the AT itself, but the side trail takes you through tunnels of pink and orange and brings you to areas where the flowering bushes are really tightly concentrated. I've never seen anything like it. The abundance of pink and orange littering the hillsides draws people from all over the country and even the world. One guy I met came all the way from Germany for the occasion. Throughout that mile or so I took more pictures than I've ever taken in any given day of my trip. Yet, even all of the pictures and descriptions don't come close to expressing how extravagantly beautiful these scenes truly were. After returning from my detour the trail continued to roll up and over the hills atop the ridge, dipping in and out of the tree line until crossing the parking area before climbing the remaining 700 or so feet to the summit of the Roan Mtn. range. Although I had expected this part to be the worst climb of the day, I should have known better given its proximity to the parking areas. Wherever the trail intersects a road accompanied by a parking area for the public to access popular view points and such areas of interest, one can expect the trail to be nicely groomed and leveled off, sometimes scattered with crushed stones and widened to accommodate the increased traffic it receives. Such areas leave many people with the impression that the whole AT must naturally be maintained like that. Little do they know it is far from your average ""walk in the park."" Atop the Knob was the Roan High Knob Shelter, the highest shelter on the AT at 6,193' in elevation. I might have considered staying the night if there were any views to be had, but the area surrounding the shelter was densely covered in coniferous trees. So I set my sights on ending at one of two areas up ahead that were marked in the guidebook as having reliable sources of water. Usually you can expect to find camping around such areas, but unless it explicitly says so in the book, you're taking a bit of a chance. For instance, the first spring I encountered on the side of the trail did in fact have a nice flat spot just past the water source, but unfortunately for me it was already occupied by a mother and her daughter. The next area I had looked at on the map didn't have a single flat area in its vicinity so I filled up on water and continued walking until dark. Ended up pitching my tent on some old abandoned roadbed that I spotted once I came down off the hillside and into the Gap.","Hump Mtn.

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543517,"Set off nice and early this morning in hopes of making it to Greasy Creek Hostel before noon where I was to pick up the replacement knee brace my doctor had sent me. The one I have currently has been slowly falling apart, the most recently issue involving the plastic stays to either side of the brace busting out of their stitching and digging uncomfortably into my leg. Made good time getting there but it was still a half mile off trail, all downhill of course. I hid my pack in the woods and camouflaged it with sticks and leaves. Definitely remained hidden from view of any passerby's but not necessarily from the smell of any wildlife that might be nearby. Though I knew that I would be much faster without my cumbersome bag in tote so I detached the brain (the top of the pack) and slack packed down the washed out roadbed in hopes of making it a quick detour. Nothing about it was quick though. My package wasn't even there when I arrived and yet I found myself spending a few hours talking to Connie (aka CC; the owner) and her boyfriend Randy (Gadget). Very friendly and welcoming people. Gadget was very knowledgeable about the trail and told me that I had been straddling the NC/TN border and would continue doing so for many miles to come. In many areas, the ridge line marks the state boundary itself, and the AT follows that line on and off so that you unknowingly are hiking with one foot in NC and the other in TN at times. Watched a quick little rainstorm roll in off the mountains and began worrying about my backpack that I had left behind. Luckily I had thought to throw the pack cover over just in case it rained while I was gone, but now I had been away for much longer than I had anticipated which ultimately leaves more time for any curious animals to find my pack and get into it. When I went to leave CC told me to have a ""super butterfly day"" which at first I thought was kind of corny until she explained that butterflies don't fly in the rain. Unfortunately I didn't happen to see any butterflies flying around today. There were, however, an abundance of red effs littering the trail ahead which is a common occurrence after it rains. Decided to night hike as I had heard on the TV back at the hotel that tonight was supposed to be some sort of full moon or something. Plus I was set on be getting into the town of Erwin, TN by tomorrow and still had a good ways to go yet. So as the day faded away, I sat and watched the sun sink down in the sky and the light with it. Unfortunately it wasn't long before I begrudgingly had to use my headlamp to illuminate my surroundings. The moon was shrouded from view by a thick layer of clouds that seemed to have blanketed the whole sky. But my headlamp brought to light some interesting creatures of the night that the moon never would have shown. The most common thing I saw were 3-6"" salamanders that had a glossy black color and bulging eyes. They too were scattered across the trail in plenitude, just as the red effs had been earlier. After hiking for over an hour I saw something disturbingly familiar along the trail which told me without a doubt that I had been going to the wrong way this entire time. To make matters worse it then began to rain. I was also running low on water as I had planned to fill up at the next shelter going South from where I started my night hiking. Eventually I rolled into the shelter space wet, tired and hungry. It was just before midnight and I had had my fill of unfortunate events for tonight. I cut my losses and set up camp in the vicinity of the shelter. Won't be making it into town early tomorrow from here but boy does it feel good to be in camp right about now.","Hughes Gap

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543520,"Last one into camp and first to leave. Lately I've been automatically waking up with the sun and find it difficult to fall back asleep for any extended period afterwards. The nice crisp breeze blew out the fog that had settled in the valley after the rain last night. As I headed up Unaka Mtn. the dense spruce forest had me reminiscing about my grandparents cottage in Northern ME. Its funny how distinctive smells like that of the spruce trees can bring back such vivid memories from the past. I can close my eyes and find myself back at their house on the lake, standing on the dock, fishing pole in hand and a big smile on my face. Their quaint piece of property is one of my favorite places in the world. After a brief spell of nostalgia I emerged into a grassy clearing with striking view off to the East. Didn't stick around for long though as I was still behind schedule and wanted to make sure I was at Uncle Johnny's Hostel in time to catch the last shuttle into town. Otherwise I'd have to wait until the following morning to do my errands in town which would mean hitting the trail later in the day when its hottest out. After a few more hours of hiking I finally got sight of the Nolichucky River below. It was a most welcome sight. The hostel was conveniently located next to the river, not even a stones throw from the trail itself. I arrived with just over a half hour to spare before the last shuttle left for town. Gave me time to somewhat clean myself up after coming off the trail drenched in sweat. Uncle Johnny must've felt sorry for me upon seeing my sweaty state because he insisted that I take his cold beer that he had just opened before I walked in. I did my best not to chug it down as soon as my lips touched the rim, as it was so unbelievably refreshing. The shuttle took a group of us over to the Walmart complex where I was hoping to get a new frame for my glasses. Just so happened to be the one Super Walmart that had everything with the exception of a vision center. I guess that'll just have to wait for another time. Had a mini Christmas having gotten a box from home with more homemade cookies and even a couple of mangos wrapped in bubblewrap. Not to brag but I do have the best parents in the world. And anyone who has gotten to know them would surely agree. Had a few beers with IPA (that is to say the person so named IPA), wounded knee and a few other great folks and then took a nice long and undisturbed shower before turning in for the night.","Cherry Gap Shelter

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550325,"Excited to be getting back on the trail again. Had a really nice time visiting with family and Christina but the trail has been calling and I've been growing anxious to return to the woods. After finishing up the Southern half of my hike from WV-GA, I took a flight to CT and spent some time at home before my mother brought me up to Bangor, ME where we stayed the night at her friend Nancy MacDonald's house. Despite having had lots of time to plan out our trip to Mt. Katahdin, we found ourselves scrambling to figure out logistics the very night before. From everything we had read, our chances of even getting a parking spot were slim without a reservation. The two of us left Bangor around 5am to make the hour and a half drive to Baxter State Park. After driving for miles on wilderness encompassing back-roads into the park, we suddenly came upon a line of cars waiting at the gate. Neither one of us was all too sure what was going on or how they orchestrated the whole ordeal between those with and without a reservation so we waited for 15-20 minutes while the cars slowly trickled through the gate ahead. Miraculously we were able to secure a parking spot, so mom decided she'd hike with me for however long. She'd come prepared to do so just in case we managed to find parking but yet her attire consisted of a cotton shirt and shorts and considerably worn sneakers that she uses during her daily walks around the block. We took the ""less strenuous"" Abol trail which had been recently rerouted and newly reopened just this year. Both of us figured we'd just start hiking and and see how things went. There was no set plan with our approach; it simply kept evolving as we went. I was just happy to be hiking with my mother at that point. It had been years since we hiked together, even though I have her and my father to credit for my passion for the outdoors. It was nice and mellow walking for the first hour or so but quickly escalated from there. Thankfully the trail crew had employed switchbacks and even installed rock steps in places to help make the inclines easier. It was really neat to see the ""bare roots"" stage of the trail work being done. The ranger we talked to at the base of the mountain estimated they'd be working on it for another 2-3 years. After breaking treeline it became a whole new ball game. The dirt and rock steps were replaced by loose rocks to slide on, roots you couldn't trust to support you, and no trees to act as a buffer between you and the extravagantly beautiful, but dangerously steep drop behind you. Unless she could find a sizable rock to act as a buffer, mom refused to look back, no matter how spectacular the view was. As the pitch of the slope increased and the loose rock turned to boulders, she willed herself onward, tightly hugging the rocks against the slope along the way. The route became quite technical in places to where we were practically bouldering. Reaching the tabletop was quite the milestone in itself, but for mom it was quite discouraging to see that we still had another mile until the summit. Even though the trail from there was relatively gentle in comparison to all that we had just come up, I could still see a look of dismay upon her face at the fact that there was more ahead. Yet now that the worst was behind us and the summit within view, there was no way either one of us was going to turn back now. After a short break and a Snickers bar, she was back on her feet and determined to reach the top. Spent nearly an hour at the top taking it all in and rejoicing in our accomplishment. For someone who merely walks a mile around the block every day and is deathly afraid of heights to come out and climb Katahdin is truly remarkable. Neither one of us could believe that she had made it the whole way, and I was indubitably impressed. The breathtakingly beautiful panoramic view before us was quite the reward, but being able to enjoy it together made it that much more special. Nothing but trees, mountains, and bodies of water for as far as the eye could see. Pure wilderness. Now I remember why Katahdin is my absolute favorite mountain. Took some pictures at the infamous summit sign and then proceeded back down the way we came. Given how treacherous the route up had been, there was no chance that I was going to let my mother descend it on her own. Originally I had planned on taking the Hunt trail (the AT) back down, but the thought of leaving my mother alone to face her fear of heights didn't sit right with me. We came up together and therefore we'd be going down together. She went most of the way down on her butt focusing only on what was immediately ahead. At times while we waited for people in front of us to move along I'd look back and see her with her eyes shut tight. I lost track of how many times she exclaimed ""Holy Shit"" on the way up and ""Jesus"" on the way down. By the time we got back to the car it was almost 7pm and I was still unsure as to where I'd be spending the night. Thankfully the ranger I talked to was extremely nice and found a spot for me to stay within the park. Said goodbye to mom and had a quick bite to eat before turning in for the night.","Mt. Katahdin

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550341,"Quite literally slept on the ground last night as my sleeping mat seems to have sprung a leak. Luckily the ground was soft and I was tired so it didn't affect my sleep all that much. Got packed up and was on the Hunt trail by 7:30am. Borrowed sunscreen from a girl named Butter after getting burnt from my prolonged exposure to the direct sun yesterday. The trail paralleled Katahdin Stream for the first mile or so before branching off just after the falls. Maybe it was a bit of nostalgia but those falls are probably the most spectacular I've seen on the trail. The water itself is so clean and pure that it's as if you are looking through glass. Spent a little while admiring the falls before continuing up the rock steps and soon to be boulder strewn trail. Got a few brief spurts of rain on the way up but nothing too bad. Still got some gorgeous views beyond treeline, which is where the fun part began. Climbed boulders the size of school buses stacked near vertical, some of which had rungs drilled into them in a few places to boost yourself up with. From there you're just scrambling up the rocky ridge, surrounded by nothing but wilderness and fellow hikers. Once I made it to the tabletop I couldn't see the summit as it was shrouded from view by a puffy gray cloud. The cloud lingered there casting raindrops on the ridge below. It completely blocked out all of the spectacular scenery that mom and I had witnessed just yesterday. On the plus side, the weather must've really deterred people from summiting because when I arrived only one other person was up there, which is all I needed to take my picture. Again. There may have been a crowd of people to contend with yesterday, but I couldn't have asked for a better day, nor a better hiking partner to share such a glorious moment with. It wouldn't have been nearly as special without her there. Didn't linger at the top for long, but while I was there I met a young guy named Ringer who was a NOBO turned SOBO. We chatted for a bit on the way down and eventually encountered an older woman, Beth, who had just completed the last section of her AT hike that she started in the 70's. She was concerned about getting down the last steep section with the iron rungs on her own so we hung back and assisted where we could before taking off ahead. Once back at the Ranger station I learned that someone had given up there reservation to one of the lean-to sites to thru-hikers. This meant I no longer had to hike the additional 9 miles out of the park today. I later found out that Beth was to thank for the site. Spent the night there with Ringer and Wildfire. Wildfire was going to be summiting tomorrow on her birthday. Heck of a way to celebrate such an occasion! The end still feels like a long ways away to me at this point.","Baxter State Park

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550342,"Had a pretty restless night sleeping on the hard wooden platform in the lean-to. Took a little longer than usual getting out of camp but still managed to leave by 9am. Ventured down a few short side trails on my way out of the park to Little Niagara Falls and Big Niagara Falls. Despite all of the waterfalls I've seen already, they still never cease to amaze me. So many beautiful spots along the way that make you want to stop and admire them, but unfortunately the day just isn't long enough. There was, however, one area along the river that drew me in for an hour or so. I sat there on the smooth granite slab that jutted out into the river, just next to a small waterfall cascading down into a deep pool below. Submerged my air mattress in a shallow, slow moving pool of water just above the falls and found the source of the leak. Noticed a few good sized trout near me as well, but unfortunately this area is only open to fly fishing and I happen to be carrying a spin casting rod. Continued out of the park and stopped at the camp store at Abol bridge, just before entering the 100 mile wilderness. They've added on a restaurant since I was last here a little over a year ago now, but I neglected to eat there. The 100 mile wilderness is just as I remember it though; lots of roots and rocks. When I arrived at the first shelter I was surprised to find a bag of bagels and a jar of peanut butter that someone had delivered earlier today (according to the attached note). And not just any peanut butter, but rather Peter Pan honey roast peanut butter. Someone knew I was coming! Found the perfect secluded spot to tent just to the West of the shelter. The small stream in front of the shelter opened up into a wide, slow moving section of water that looked like moose heaven.

It's not even worth reinflating during the night because I'll simply find myself on the ground again within an hours time. Woke up cold a few times and even wore my jacket and pants around camp first thing in the morning. Got a late start and was down to my t-shirt and briefs before long. Was rewarded with a gorgeous view looking back at Mt. Katahdin from Rainbow Ledges and filled up on blueberries there too. Met a couple from England (Don Quixote and chatterbox) whom I talked to briefly. Apparently the woman, chatterbox is also diabetic, but it was her husband that noticed my insulin pump and unfortunately she was already a fair ways ahead of him so I never got the opportunity to talk with her. Such a peaceful section of trail that meandered along various bodies of water, sometimes for miles at a time. Yet you had to physically stop walking to admire such surroundings or else trip over the gnarly roots covering the trail. Stopped along Rainbow Lake to recheck my air mattress and observed a fair amount of wildlife both on and off the water. A martin ran across the log that my backpack was propped up against, while further down the shore a river otter played in the water. My absolute favorite part was hearing the loons call out from across the lake. Took a break at the west end of the lake and observed what looked to be a moose highway of sorts following along the muddy bank. Then I began hearing something big splashing around in the cove nearby. The brush was too thick to see through and the mud practically consumed my foot as I attempted to get closer. I ended up backtracking a ways and bushwhacked my way through the thick new growth of hemlocks to just above the waters edge. I busted out of the trees and came out onto a small ledge just above the cove. There, standing right in the middle of it was a big ol' cow with her head stuck down into the murky water. I guess I wasn't being all that quiet because as soon as she saw me come into view she took off crashing through the woods. I continued on to the next shelter for a late lunch and was informed by two former thru hikers that at the Pollywog stream ahead held some decent size fish. Naturally that's where I set my sights. When I arrived I realized that there was only one pool big enough to fish just under the bridge. Under normal conditions I could easily imagine there being great fishing opportunities up and down this stream, but not with the water level as low as it is now. Tried my luck there anyhow until the pesky bugs got the best of me. Took refuge in my tent and before long found myself laying on the ground once again.","Hurd Brook Lean-to

Woke up cold a few times and couldn't find a comfortable spot in between the maze of roots beneath me. On the plus side I could hear loons calling from somewhere nearby. Got an early start to the day and was beginning to feel immersed in the tranquility of the wilderness around me when I came across the 49ers (two older men both born in 1949). We startled one another pretty good which was rare for me as I'm usually the jumpy one who gets snuck up on all too often. Had a short yet strenuous climb up Nesuntabunt Mtn. that further solidified my concern over losing my trail legs during the last 10 days I spent at home. But honestly I wouldn't have changed a thing. It did however, make me realize just how much I miss everyone back home and surprisingly, I've been finding it rather difficult to re-adjust. Talking to Christina on the phone later in the day helped put me back in the right mindset. Found some great looking fishing spots along the Nahmakanta stream but all I ever caught were carp. Tried my luck on the Pemadumcook Lake instead and managed to catch a few good sized branches and even snagged a sunken tree trunk. Unintentionally took a little dip as I slipped while walking out to retrieve my favorite lure. Such a beautiful spot though with yet another view of Katahdin in the distance. The best thing about these remote bodies of water is the absence of houses and bots around them. Besides the occasional stash of rowboats or canoes along the shoreline, they hold no sign of human intervention whatsoever.

Sasquatch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550324,"As you may have noticed, I've been neglecting my journal entries for quite some time now. Despite my best efforts to catch up while I was home for a few days between my flip-flop, I was not able to get it all done and alas, I now find myself halfway through the Northern section of my SOBO hike from ME-WV. For this reason I've decided to skip ahead in my online journal to document my travels up North, starting in Baxter State Park in Maine.","
