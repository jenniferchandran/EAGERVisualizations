Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493895,"I don't know the lingo yet nor have the literary style that I see so commonly used in other journals. I do have a few observations from reading several who have thru hiked the AT. They are a positive thinking and forward looking bunch whose determination, stamina, wit, and swag are admirable. Thanks to all who share their days on the trail. It will be about 9 months until my attempt and already I am excited. I am known by two nicknames Mr. B and Gramps. I chose the later as it was given to me by my first grandchild whose first pronunciation sounded more like ""Gunk"" that ""Gramps"". I am glad that ""Gramps"" stuck with her as her speech developed.

Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/494089,"Few things have captured my interest more than reading trail journals. I've so much to learn and there is a wealth of knowledge to gather from the experience of others. Already narrowed down some gear choices. The Tarptent arrived last week. It was raining so I set it up in my living room. Was feeling pretty good about that until reading about how frequently it appears that I'll have to set it up in the rain.   Thinking about a light weight tarp to set up quickly And then put the tent up under it. Hope someone might shed some light on whether that sounds smart. One day closer,Gramps",,setting up in the rain ,"May 11, Mon",0

I was concerned that the vestibule might be too small in this Tarptent pro trail so put my pack in it over night during a deluge and I was presently surprised. I also figured out a way to prop the vestibule fly open with my trekking pole to allow for enough room to cook in the rain if necessary.

Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510338,"Almost everyone I tell about my plans to thru-hike the AT ask me a ""why question"" of some sort. The answers I've given typically are about me, ""I need another challenge"", ""I want to disengage from the work-a-day world and get a fresh perspective,"" ""I want to escape the unrelenting presidential campaign ads for 6 months"", ""I don't really know, I just want to do it."" Are the typical responses.But the answers have always seemed selfish and lacking a higher purpose--a purpose that will keep me motivated during the hike--a reason that is bigger than me--a goal that extends beyond the trail--a focus that will entertain my thoughts and prayers--something that highlights my passion in life.I have spent most of my life engaged in either direct care of at risk children and teens or managing an organization that provides services to at risk children and their families. I have frequently said, ""life does't get much better than making a difference in the life of an at-risk child."" I am finishing a 25 year career with Cookson Hills Christian Ministries, a residential childcare facility in Oklahoma. Www.cooksonhills.org if you want to know more about it. They have graciously given me a 6 month sabbatical to do a the thru-hike. I owe them a debt of gratitude for their generosity. So now to the point of this entry. The children I have spent most of my life attempting to help in some way have ussually have had unbelievable difficulties dealt them. I refer to them as children who come from hard places. Overcoming abuse, neglect and other forms of trauma presents them with challenges that are much more demanding than the trail could ever be, yet I have seen them overcome, rise above and alter their life trajectory from toxic to terrific. So I am hiking as a tribute to their resiliency, determination and long obedience to a changed lifestyle. I am assembling a list of their names and will be focusing my walk each day during my Thru-hike on one of them and the overwhelming odds they overcame to be where they are today. They are my Heroes! They will give me encouragement! They are noteworthy people! And I love them!",,A Greater Purpose,"Aug 16, Sun",0
Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511894,"I'm just starting to get into some intentional training and after a couple of weeks of hiking on rolling hills I thought I should try some steeper climbs. Did a quarter mile with about 200 feet elevation gain and thought I was going to die!! That is nothing to what I see coming on the AT. I see other thru hikers talking about 3,000+ elevation gain in 2 miles. Good thing I have six more months to prepare.",,preparing for climbs 1 ,"Aug 29, Sat",0
Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513152,"My wife and I have been in transition during the last 6 months with her at our new home near children and grandchildren and me still working in Oklahoma. But for the next month I will be with her in the Louisville area. So, I am getting introduced to some of the trails in the area that I will use over the winter to get in shape and check out my gear. My son had a day off mid week so we drove about a half hour south of Louisville to Bernheim Forest where we tackled a short but rigorous trail. Elm Lick Trail is at the back end of the Forest and so is least traveled. It is only 5 miles but gave me a better workout that the road and park walking available close to home. It rained the night before so it was also nice and muddy. From what I read from previous thru-hikers, I need to make friends with the likes of mud, rocks and roots. This trail gave us a little of all three, but overall was not extremely strenuous inspite of the ""Difficult"" rating the park gave it. There is another trail in the forest called the ""millenium Trail"" and is about 14.5 miles. I look forward to doing it in the next few weeks as well, but still have a bit of training to go before tackling that distance in a day. I think I could do it now, but want to be wise about my training and not risk a set back due to an injury during training. Bernheim doesn't allow overnights but is a really nice place for day hikes of 1-14 miles with several short (1-3 mile) loops. There is a nice nature center there and the folks are really friendly and helpful. Great place if your in the area and looking for a short hike.",,Elm Lick Trail--Bernheim Forest Kentucky,"Sep 11, Fri",0
Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515490,"Wow! I am amazed at the response I have received from numerous well wishers and so excited to have some of my former foster kids from 25-30 years ago who will be joining me for small sections of the trail. They are terrific and so encouraging. Training continues mostly in spurts, but I am managing to average about 4 miles a day carrying 20 lb. pack--Up until this week, that is. It has taken a nose dive while traveling to see donors to the organization I work for. Lots of miles traveled but almost all in the seat of my truck. Finish the travels for a while next week and plan to get back on the trail some more.I have researched extensively regarding a choice on sleeping pads. I had an REI Pad that I have used for some time. It is comfortable and offers pretty good insulation, but is bulky and heavy. After looking at and consulting with folks who used the closed cell foam type pads and comparing them to the comfort of a self inflating pad, I decided to buy a Thermarest Pro-lite standard size. I think it offers acceptable comfort for a side sleeper, good insulating value and, best of all--it is light and packs small. I hope it proves to work well. I worry a bit about it developing leaks, so I suppose a patching kit is in order. I would welcome suggestions about what the best choice for patching supplies.",,Trail Partners and sleeping pads,"Oct 09, Fri",0
Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516608,"Thanks to several of you who have contacted me with helpful suggestions, gear reviews, etc. A special shout out to Boomer, I Believe and Jimmy who have been most helpful as I make preparations. Training continues and the weather here in northern KY couldn't be better--cool and wet. Jared, my son, and I did the trails in Tom Sawyer State Park, Louisville, earlier in a steady rain to test my pack cover and rain gear. I and my gear stayed dry but I am still thinking that it would be good insurance to use compactor bags inside my pack. Most of my training has consisted of mileage with a full pack but on relatively flat trails. I am feeling good but concerned that I may have maxed out what can be done to get in shape without some rougher terrain than what is locally available. So, Saturday Nov. 7 I am joining a hiking group from Southeast Christian Church and plan to drive to Red River Gorge State Park in KY, about 2.5 hours from here to do an 8.5 mile loop. Jared, my son, also put me on to another place about 2 hours south of Louisville called Ramer Hollow in Mammoth Cave National Park, KY. I am hoping Jared will join me on a cold weather weekend to do the 16.5 mile loop down there. That will give me an opportunity to get a little more experience with my cold weather and cooking gear. I have been honored by many former foster children whose stories I hope to share during my AT thru-hike. They are amazingly resilient and I am hoping that all of you who follow me on this journey will enjoy and be inspired by their stories. So far they include: Tom, Jeri, Chrystal, Cathy, Rita, Heath and Mark, Becky, Melinda (my wife), Michelle, Kelly, Tatahda, Sierra, Andrea and Kirk. I hope to add this many more over the winter. You will be amazed at their accomplishments.They are my Heroes! I hike in their honor.",,Tougher Trials Needed,"Oct 30, Fri",0
Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517124,"I'd been doing about 4 miles daily with a full pack and feeling good but knew I needed something a bit more challenging so I joined up with a Hiking club associated with Southeast Christian Church last Saturday to do an 8.5 mile hike in Red river Gorge Kentucky. Weather was perfect, overcast and in the mid 50's all day. There were 12 in the group some very experienced and others not so much but they were so kind to welcome an old man to their group and I got a great workout with some terrific folks. We finished the trail about 4:00 pm then it was straight to a local pizza place that caters to hikers and rock climbers in the area. Miguel's pizza is fantastic. Special order by the slice with anything you want on it. It was awesome. Definitely worth checking out if your in the area.

Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517797,"Thanksgiving day was a blessed day that included my son Jared and his family and a recently moved new family to our town from Poland (Arec, Gosia, and Cuba). What a pleasure sharing thanksgiving stories with some folks who grew up in communist Poland and cherish the freedom they now have. After way too much to eat, a long hike was needed, so Jared and I packed up and drive about two hours south of Louisville KY to Mammoth cave national park for a two day 19 mile shakedown hike. It was perfect temperature for hiking and the weather promised to give us a good soaking rain. We set out from Maple Springs car park and did about 9.5 miles by 4pm , set up camp, had dinner and crawled into outr tents by 6:30 just as it began to rain. Jared in his new bivy sack with tyvec overhead and me in my Tarptent Protrail. Rained steadily all night long and we fixed breakfast and packed up in a light rain. From all accounts, I need to get accustomed to that experience. No pain--no rain--no Maine as they say. So packing up and hiking 9 miles in a steady rain was a good learning opportunity. Found out my rain cover on the pack is pretty much worthless in actually keeping pack contents dry--I will definitely be relying on using trash compactor bags inside pack instead of rain cover To keep things dry. Tent worked out great and I am really pleased with it. It wasn't cold enough to test my sleeping system which consists right now of a thermarrest self inflatable pad, 20 degree artificial fill bag, and silk liner. Stayed warm but temps only got diwn to upper 40's. I am contemplating switching to a down filled quilt. Anyone have experience to give me some advice on this would be appreciated. It was good to get a couple of solid days in the back country and has given me some confirmation that my conditioning is progressing as I thought. Still need to gain some strength in knees and ankles over the winter and with just 100 days before Springer, I am more excited than ever.",,Mammoth Cave Shakedown Hike,"Nov 29, Sun",0
Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518273,"""Taking a break"" isn't exactly an accurate way to describe this week since I am now unemployed and have nothing to do but work on the ""honey do"" projects at home. But, instead of that the ""honey"" and I decided to spend a few days together in Nashville. We thoroughly enjoyed a show by Amy Grant and Vince Gill last night. They are an extremely talented couple who put on a great show. With seeing if you get a chance. Hit the Bass Pro shop scoping out a few minir items yet to be added to my gear. Going to spend tomorrow in Franklin antique shopping with lunch down town. Today marks the beginning of a 90 day count down until I start on the trail. I get more excited every day and am looking forward to improving strength in my knees and ankles while also improving pulmonary/cardio as well. Hope to hit the trail in shape for 8 to 10 mile days with no problem and then gradually increase mileage to an average of 13 to 14 by the time I make it through the Smokies. Thanks to ""Jimmy"" and ""I Believe"" who have volunteered to help me till I make Newfound Gap. If they are any indication of the Trail Angels I will meet along the way, well, it is going to be a blessed experience. I have only corresponded and spoke with them on the phone and they already feel like old friends. Thanks also to Rita Karnes ""Tennessee Pearl"" and her husband Doug, lifetime friends who live in Knoxville who have volunteered to offer some support through from Newfound gap on through Tennessee. Can't be thankful enough to my remarkable wife, a hero whose story I will tell early on the trail. She has no interest in hiking. Well, actually she does like hiking, but the thoughts of no latrine send her scampering for a hotel. But even though not joining me in the trail, she has been a remarkable source of encouragement and understanding and will be making a few visits along the way and be there when I summit Katadyn. I am also looking forward to several other friends to join me along the way for some support and encouragement. 90 days and counting.",,Taking a Break,"Dec 10, Thu",0
Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521319,"To say that I am disappointed to have to adjust plans is an under statement. Though disappointed, I am also grateful.The disappointing news:Much has happened since my last post and to keep it short, I will hit the highlights. I had anticipated being retained and paid throughout 2016 by my previous employer with the ability to take a 6 month sabbatical during which time I had planned to thru-hike the AT. Those plans did not materialize and instead of a 12 month window of pay, it was reduced to 6 months and no continuing employment or benefits. Therefore, I needed to initiate a job search 6 months earlier than I had anticipated and cut my hiking time to about 5 weeks instead of 6 months. So now, I plan to section hike the AT over the next few years as I can make time. Now the things I am grateful for:First, I am able and ready to hike starting March 10 and plan to get from Springer Mountain to Erwin, TN by April 13. That means I will need to increase my daily mileage average a bit and get lucky on weather but I am in pretty good physical shape and think it is doable without undue risk. Second, I was offered a position that has better pay and benefits than my previous employer and has a start date of May 2, 2016. 18 days short of the six month window provided by my previous employer. Praise God! Third, upon completion of my first section, my wife and I will have 3 weeks of uninterrupted time together before I start a new full time job. Fourth, my new employer graciously offered 4 weeks of vacation annually so I will have a couple of weeks a year to commit to section hiking moving forward.Finally, I have all my gear worked out and tested and am confident that I will be well equipped and as light as I want to be. My final purchase was a change in my sleeping system from a synthetic mummy bag to an Enlightened Equipment down filled quilt that I love. It gives me more room as a side sleeper, is warmer and is 16 oz. lighter.  Now the final conditioning and countdown starts. March 10 is just around the corner.",,Change of Plans,"Feb 17, Wed",0
Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523682,"March 10, 2016The morning started with breakfast at the hiker hostel in Dahlanega, GA. The folks at Hiker Hostel are great hosts. About 8:30am they loaded us in a suburban and took is to within a mile of the southern terminal of the AT. Springer Mountain. I climbed a mile to the top to officially start the trail. Then hiked 8.1 miles more to Hawk mountain shelterI don't remember all the names of the folks I met, but here are some that I started with. Owl, Linda, Dave, zimbabwe(not his real name but he grew up as a missionary kid there ),John, and several more.I felt pretty good until the last mile. Back and feet hit tired and I was ready to call it a day after 9.1 miles at 2:30 pm. Setting up camp was a breeze and after cooking chicken and rice and a good nights rest I was ready for another day. The only downside last night was that I forgot where I put my nose spray so didn't breath through my nose so well most of the night. However it didn't prevent me from sleeping through a rain storm and some gun shots from a near by Army ranger station. Inspiration today:It was 1963 in Miami, Oklahoma and a family of seven children age 2-13 had just lost their mother to breast cancer. The father, already a heavy drinking railroad worker drowned his sorrows in more alcohol and became a nightmare of a father. His physical abuse of the children when he was present made the long periods of neglect and absence seem like a relief to the seven children who now did their best to take care of each other and stay alive, often with little more than bread and water to eat. If they had been well behave in the eyes of the older brother, and there was sugar and butter in the house, they were treated with desert of bread sugar and butter.   Though many were aware of their situation and the ongoing neglect by the Father, the children mostly hid the abuse. It wasn't talked about until decades later, but several of the children bore the physical scars on their back, not to mention the hidden emotional trauma of the chronic neglect. After 7 years of abuse and neglect and the entrance and departure of 3 step mothers and several step children, Enter Church Lady. Her name is not remembered, but here courageous and caring intervention will never be forgotten. She lovingly began taking the youngest 5 children to church on the weekends. As things worsened at home for them she arranged for them to be placed in a children's home where they all lived until graduating high school. The youngest was 9 at the time. Her name is Melinda.She remembers how good it felt to have her own bed with the people who tucked her in at night still there the next morning to waken her. She recalls the life saving reassurance that sunk in when she finally realized that there would always be another meal and she reluctantly gave up sneaking food from the table as her trust grew in the folks who cared for her. I first met her when she was 13 and my parents went I work at the children's home where she lived. She was a fun loving, quick witted, smart young lady whose love for life was contagious. Inspire of the chronic neglect she experienced as a young childhood, this teenager had already learned to rise above her circumstances and was casting herself as the hero in her own story instead of playing the role of victim. I was drawn to her because of her infectious optimism and zeal for life. Friends for several years, I finally got the courage to ask her to the prom during the spring of our junior year of high school. She agreed and thus began a life long love. We were married after our first year of college. Forty three years ago this coming July. My thanks goes out to ""Church Lady"" for her living intervention when she noticed some children in need. I'm sure she would not have dreamed of the impact her choices made.Melinda gave birth two fine sons one a Doctor who treats patients in the Emergency Rooms of several Louisville hospitals and one who leads worship for some 20,000 church goers in Lousiville. I can't wait to thank ""Church Lady"" when I get to heaven. Her ""cup of cold water"" intervention is heroic in my eyes--she preserved an astounding lady with who I will open the rest of my life.","Springer Mountain

Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523686,"March 11, 2016My Hero for the day is my wife. You were introduced to her in the journal yesterday and if there was ever a person to have reason to live out the life of a victim it is her, but she chooses every day to play that role in her own story. She is the most joyful person you will ever want to meet and her joy is not a surface act but rather a deep enduring joy fueled by her Faith in God. It allows her to rise above any circumstances she is facing day in and day out. She takes joy in simple pleasures and finds meaning and purpose in the difficulties that inevitably come. Tough times drive her to go deeper in her faith and she always comes through having seized the good in the situation and letting go of the experiences that weigh most people down. She is the love of my life. She has been most understanding of my departure for a few weeks.Not many men get the chance to live with their Hero, but I do. I'm blessed beyond imagination. I Rested well and felt good this morning. Watched a beautiful sunrise this morning that reminded me of numerous things I am thankful for today. Wife, children, grandchildren who I already miss tremendously. Prayed for them through a few tears of thanksgiving before I boiled some water for oatmeal and hot chocolate. Took a while to pack up but was ready to hit the trail by 8:30am. Had 7.7 miles to go to Gooch Mountain Shelter. The first couple miles weren't too bad but then came to Sassafras Mountain. It was a long kick-your-but walk up for about a mile and a half. At the top there were some good views Looking toward the south east for Twenty or thirty miles of Georgia hills as far as you could see. The decent from Sassafras was steep and long but we were rewarded with our first ""trail magic"" when we reached Coopers gap at about 11:45. ""Psycho Bob"" is a former thru hiker and also maintains the first mile of the trail from Springer Mountain. He was pulling in the parking lot as I arrived at Coopers Gap. He parked and proceeded to unload chairs, a cooler full of Gatorade, a grill, hot dogs, brauts, buns and all the fixings. It was my first trail magic and it was awesome. After stuffing my face with hot dogs and Gatorade, I packed up and climbed Justice mountain. It was difficult but not as bad as Sassafras. Justice Creek was on the other side of the mountain and offered a terrific place to shed my shows and soak my feet in ice cold mountain stream while I rested up for the final 2 mile push to Gooch mountain. The big story of the day from all the hikers here at Gooch Mountain is the trail magic. I picked up an extra day of food from Stacy, a lady who dropped out after day one. She graciously brought all her food and emptied it on the shelter table and said we could have whatever we wanted. That with the trail magic today will allow me to skip a reapply in Suches, GA tomorrow and press on to lance creek campsite tomorrow and then Neels gap on Sunday where I will resupply. Lesson of the day for me. There is one Hill after another and the time and Vistas from the mountain top are glorious, but then it is on to the next inevitable climb. At times I wish life were different and that there weren't new things that are difficult and push me out of my comfort zone. Satan is kind of like these mountains. He is always there try to kick my but and make me stumble. He is unrelenting and cunning. He attacks our weaknesses. I am noticing that with each Mountain I climb my strength is increased a little. And I am a bit more prepared for the next. I also have noticed that I need to pace myself and keep the Longview in mind. This is not a sprint and neither is life, although I have often lived it as though it were. I'm finding a few things help me on the long hard slogs uphill. 1. Keep moving forward 2. Slow the pace to what allows you to take the next step. 3. Each step is one step closer to the trails end. 4. Keep yourself aware of each step 5. Stay aware of your feet and take care of them. Not sure how or whether there are points to ponder related to life but I will do so tomorrow. Safe and sound for another night.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523689,"My Hero for the day is Tom. He joined our family as a foster son in 1976. He was 10 years old at the time. He lived with us through high school with no possibility of being ""back home"" as many of our foster children hoped for. He didn't know who his birth father was and his mother died when he was preschool age so he was placed with his Grandma until she passed away just a short time later. She had made provisions in her will to leave he and his two older sister(they also lived with us) to be placed at the children's home where my wife and I were working. In spite of the early childhood trauma of losing his mother and grandmother, Tom was a fairly well adjusted boy who was a good student and a joy to share life with during those years. He was eager to help and most capable of anything he set out to do. As a middle schooler he designed and built a chicken house so we could raise chickens and have eggs. What we didn't realize is that there was some stored up anger stemming from early on that we did not effectively help with so when We celebrated Tom's graduation and entry into the U. S. Air Force, we had no idea that he had been left with the stored up residue of childhood trauma and some resentment that we hadn't really helped him resolve it. So he began dealing with adult stress and strain with the help of Alcohol. After a few years and a downward spiral he courageously stepped out of the role of victim in his own story and began to write a new story with the help of God and some folks who helped him through recovery. By the grace of God, Tom has been in recovery for about a decade, maybe more. He is married to a remarkable woman and works in the building and zoning offices for a city near Houston Texas.Tom is my hero because he humbled himself enough to be honest and continues a life of recovery as a humble and grateful person who, in submission to God, has chosen a life of sobriety. Today's journalGot a great nights sleep (7pm - 5am). Laid in until daylight and was packed up and ready to go by 7:30am. The early start put me ahead of the bubble and the cool 58degree weather made for great hiking. Had only gone about half a mile when I encountered some more trail magic. Mountain dew(of course) and chocolate chip cookies). Then after another 4 miles in at Woodys gap there were two more groups handing out trail magic. Got another Mountain Dew and assorted candy bars and raisins just before today's toughest climb which wasn't too difficult. It was Big Cedar Mountain. About 2/3 of the way up is Preachers Rock which features some awesome views of the Georgia wilderness. From the top of Big Cedar it was another 2 mile mostly down hill that I completed at 12:30pm. With the promise of rain tonight and Blood Mountain (the biggest climb so far) featuring a 4 mile uphill trek looming, I decided to hunker down and set camp and rest this afternoon instead of taking on the next 7.4 miles to Neels Gap. I will tackle that tomorrow with fresh legs and a couple pounds less food in my pack. Lessons for the day.1. I discovered that Jared's advice, ""Every step you take is a step closer to your goal."" Is certainly true. But after three days. It starts feeling a bit like my Dad's old saying, ""It will feel better when it quits hurting""--both true but not tremendously insightful.2. A good friend by your side can be life saving. A couple from New Jersey probably in their mid 40's whose trail names are ""Off Balance and Off Center"". (They are aptly named) took off ahead of me this morning. I caught them about a mile in). She had leg cramps so was resting along the way. About a quarter mile later I heard what sounded like a heard of Buffaloes come down the hill behind me. When I turned he was running down the trail carrying both packs. He ran to the bottom of the hill and rested until she caught up and then away he went again. This went on for at least two more miles until we reached Woody Gap where they were able hire a guy to haul them in to Suches. There couldn't be a better example of carrying another's burden. I admired his heroism.   It made me thankful for the people who have come alongside me recently to be a source of encouragement. Melinda, Matt, Kamille, Jared, Liz, the grandchildren and A former coworker, Cathy. They all mean so much to me and have fueled resilience in me to bounce back from some tough and unexpected hard times. You are my heroes too!!","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523700,"Up hill climbs are inevitable in life. Wishing them away in our mind only makes them more difficult when we face them. Embracing them builds strength.Cathy's childhood was interrupted with the divorce of her parents when she was young. Not long after a Methodist Minister became her stepfather. You would expect a minister to live a life that was consistent with his calling, but her experience was far from that. Hers became a life of physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Her survival required her to develop finally honed sensitivity to anything remotely dangerous and the intonation in the words of others became a trusted thermometer of when to stay clear and who could be trusted. Believing she was a dirty little girl who could never be loved purely and accepted without conditions, Not surprisingly, she honed skills to protect her heart from further hurt. Unfortunately what was so important to her survival as an adolescent became the foundation for a fear based lens thru which she viewed adult relationships. Facing her fears and the origins of them was a monumentally courageous decision that sets her apart from others and makes her one of my heroes. Her climb thru the painful truth of the past was unquestionably more difficult than any mountain I will face. Like the mountains I climb, hers was not a one time mountain to top. She is a person of tremendous worth and significance. But that truth is not the default thought when she looks at her self in the mirror. It is a daily climb to keep believing that she is ""Always Loved and Special""I take courage in her climb and she is today's hero!Today's journalWoke up early this morning to steady rain at about 4am. Rolled over and went back to sleep for a couple hours and at 6 decided that it wasn't going to stop raining so I packed up in the rain and hit the trail at 7am. It rained all morning and the first four miles was a steady up hill climb to the top of blood mountain. Elevation gain was about 2000 feet. Topped the mountain and was hoping to have some views but it was foggy rainy windy and cold so I trekked on and was at Neels gap hostel at noon. A total of 6.4 miles. Immediately drank down an orange juice and at a sandwich and snicker bar, then took my pack into the outfitter to see if we could fix the slippage in the hip belt. Thanks to an old rusty hammer and nail and a screw driver, I fixed it. The outfitter thought it was awesome so he took my picture and asked if he could post it on their websit because they have had numerous problems with the osprey Atmos 50 AG and he wanted to show how I fixed it. He wants me to call him when I'm done to see if it held out. Today's walk was a slog with wet feet all day. But the hostel is great by hiker standards but Melinda wouldn't step inside I'm sure. But I got to do my laundry get all my stuff dry and clean and resupply for the next three days. Next resupply will be in Hiwassee in two days. Lessons for the day. Never under estimate what you can do. I was camped last night next to a 51 year old lady who is thru hiking with a 20 something Nonverbal autistic son who weighs about 300#. They are using ten year old heavy equipment and hiked the same miles I did today. So with that inspiration I am going to attempt a 12 mile day tomorrow and hope that if I pace myself on the uphill climbs I can do it without too much trouble. Sometimes you just have to go for it.","Lance Creek

Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523745,"Making the most of your circumstances and abilities seems to be a common thread running through many of the resilient overcomeers I have encountered. One of those is Becky Shaffer. Becky hailed from the backwoods hill country around Mena, AR. Her childhood family experience was horrendously Abusive in almost every way possible. In her case a Special social worker stepped in and rescued her. She took advantage of the help she was given by several folks along the way who introduced her to a Loving Heavenly Father who would never hurt her. When she began to believe the truth about her Heavenly Father and let that truth define her identity in Him her life was forever changed. She has been marred for about 25 years, has 3 remarkable children and founded and leads an amazing organization in Northwest Arkansas called Saving Grace. They serve young ladies who are exiting the foster system at age 18 and have no support system to fuel their continued growth needs. Her resiliency is a testimony to Gods amazing grace. She refers to herself as ""God's gracious girl"". And she is the hero of the day!Ran into an interesting dude who is thru hiking the AT with his Boston terrier. His trail name is Merlin. He has some awesome tats over all visible portions of his body. And has ""bastard"" burned into his right arm with a tatoo of ""forgiven"" tattood into his left arm. When I asked him about it he said his dad killed himself when he was in middle school and left his mom with no way to take care of the family. Not long after that his mother followed suit and he was left alone. So the right arm was an angry response to a jerk of a dad and mom and the left arm was done when he finally forgave them 5 years later. He said Forgiveness set him free! Today's journal. Slept like a baby in the shelter and woke up about 6am before dawn in the lowgap shelter. It was cool and clear and something hot just seemed the thing to do so I fixed oatmeal and hot chocolate before packing up and hitting the trail at about 8:30am.. I had an immediate uphill climb for about a half hour then another 2 mile gradual climb before a final steep push up to Beckley springs shelter the views were good all day with lots of sunshine and cool breezes up high.After topping out at Beckley springs there was a mile and a half rugged and steep down hill climb that was tough on the knees and required vigilance to ensure no missteps occurred. Roots and chunk rocks were more the norm than a well worn dirt or gravel trail. I was pleased with the about 9 miles today but the knees were definitely talking to me by the end of the day. Fortunately when I arrived at Unicoi gap there was more trail magic from Tom who was a two time thru hiker in 73 and 78. As I approached he stood up from his lawn chair and cheered and applauded. He invited me to sit down an offered Mountain Dew and Coke with a assortment of chips and sweets. I chugged down two Dews a box of cookies and some Cheetos while I waited to be shuttled to the Top of Georgia Hostel where I met triple crown hiker (did the AT 3 times)Sir Packs a lot. He is former army ranger who was given a old house near deep gap and Hiwassee. He built on and renovated it and now caters to thru hikers. It is an awesome place by hiker standards. Again Melinda probably would stay here but it is terrific. The people are just great humble folks who love to serve and encourage the hikers. They did my laundry, loaned me a Halloween scrubs to wear to town, fed us breakfast and did the closest thing to a devotional I have heard on the trail at breakfast. It was more a heart to heart talk from Sir Packs A lot who I later learned most of what he shares about hiking principles came from time he spent working with at risk kids in a residential facility. He is a cool guy who runs a class act.","Low Gap Shelter

Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523944,"Alone is a comforting thought for us introverts but it has its limits. So it is nice on the AT that there are lots of new acquaintances to make while hiking. Some start with trail names, others are named by the trail. I have met Spoony and Whistler 18 year olds just out of high school in NYC. Also, Merlin, tipsy, Off Balance, Off Center, Kiddo, Dave, Ryan, Andy and many more whose names escape me right now. They all like alone time but it is apparent with most that they also enjoy the cocmoradery when everyone bunches up at campsites for the night. None would want to be totally abandoned on the trail.  Awoke this morning after a great nights sleep at the hostel and was eager to hit the trail at Unicoi gap. I knew it would be a couple of difficult climbs and I was not disappointed. I think I'm beginning to get the hang of shifting gears (adjusting the cadence and length of my steps and my breathing) so that I can keep my heart rate at a pace that allows for continued forward movement instead of a few quick steps then stopping to catch my breath. The down hills were less demanding today so my knees felt pretty good through out the day. I camped at Sassafras Campsite after about 12 miles of hiking. It was a beautiful swag that was open to the east and west and bounded on the north and south with mountains. Because if was a clear sky we had great sunset.It was a little cooler so I built a campfire and it wasn't long until there were four others to warm up and enjoy it. One lady had taken early leave from military duty and is through hiking. Another guy, ""junko"" named after the little gray birds that flit around in the leaves of the forest. He is retired Family Practice Doctor and a bird lover. He had recorded sounds of the two different type of owls that frequent these mountains and he tried to get on to answer but nothing. Then about an hour later a Bard Owl sounded what we had been hearing almost every night about dusk. Sounds like ""who cooked the stew"" when you translate from owlish to English. Cooler weather prompted me to try out some cold weather sleeping arrangements and gave me confidence that I am pretty well equipped for what all are saying will be much colder weather in the smokies.","Unicoi Gap

Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524439,"March 18, 2016Sometimes it takes a long time for significant truths to sink in. Seems like some things truths simmer in our hearts and mind for a long time before they are accepted and incorporated in our lives.I got a Christmas card from Sherry 6 years ago after not hearing from her for 30 years. Sherry came to the children's home I worked with as an extremely troubled and angry sixteen year old. Her state was for good reason because her family had been horribly incestuous from the time of her earliest memories. She stayed for only a few months and the last time I had seen her she was in the process of running away. She was angry and had taken a butcher knife with her. When I arrived in the scene if a rural highway right of way she had separated the local small town cop from his vehicle and weapon by assaulting him with the knife. She had the upper hand.I wrapped my coat around my for-arm in an attempt to protect myself and distract her while the cop called for back up. When back up arrived she was wrestled to the ground and fortunately no one was injured. She gave me one final look of disgust and anger thru the back window of the police car as they drove away with her in cuffs and shackles. My heart was heavy, because I knew the shackles of hate and bitterness toward her abusers, though justified and understandable, would likely predict a very difficult future for her. Damn, those who abuse and hurt innocent children. As Jesus said, ""it would be better for them to have a huge stone tied around their neck and thrown into the sea.""Sherry spent several years in prison for assaulting a police officer and, according to the note in her Christmas card, ""Life had been really rough.""But, she was writing to thank me for having shown her love during a dark time in her life. Then she went on to say, ""the seeds you planted during my time with you have finally grown.""She had recently accepted the truth of God's opinion of her--That she is dearly loved and accepted no matter what her past. She said she also wanted her now thirteen year old daughter to also know and accept that truth. I love it when that truth sinks in!Today's journal:I started at Sassafras Gap Campsite and took a short 6.3 mile day to Dicks creek.The day was fairly uneventful with one pretty good climb up Kelly Knob then down hill most of the day after that. I decided to stay again at the Top of Georgia hostel over night and then get resupply rd for another three and a half days on to Franklin, North Carolina.I hung out at the city park again making some calls and soaking in some sunshine that afternoon, then back to the Hostel for the night.","Sassafras Campsite

Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524447,"March 19, 2016Inspiration for the dayI am reading through the book of Luke now while on the trail. I thought the review of What Jesus encountered would be an inspirational source and today was a real treat as I thought what he went through just before embarking on a three year long uphill climb that ended with him being resurrected from the dead after experiencing a brutal beating and crucifixion. Interestingly enough he before he embarked on those three years the Spirit of God lead him into the wilderness where he spent 40 days without food.Then the Devil attacked him. He was trying to exploit him at his weakest points. Physical appetites, power, greed. He overcame them all using the truths of Gods word. It occurred to me that in the Gospel of John, Jesus is described as the ""Word"".At the end of Jesus time on earth he promised, "" I am with you always"" then he ascended into heaven. As I was hiking today I had an awareness of Gods presence and had several conversations with Him throughout the day. I was thinking, ""If Jesus is the word and the Word is always with us, then Jesus is, right here with me. He is walking with me.""Even when I am caught in bad behavior or even when faced with temptation, he is right here with me. We face all things ""side by side"".That may seem elementary to most you, but for me that is a different concept for me to grab. I grew up in a family where God was a good guy who wanted to be near us, but our bad behavior caused him to be distant. So when faced with my own sinful stuff, it was my job to get it all cleaned up and presentable before he would want to be near me. I stood on one side of my sin and Jesus and God on the other. I have lived my live with that misconception. But today it finally soaked in that Jesus stands with me in the face of my poor behavior, bad thoughts and guilt. I don't stand alone and have to fix or fight it on my own. That realization in the depth of my spirit was accompanied by an overwhelming wave of relief and gratitude. I had hiked in cold and thick fog all day long, but within a few minutes of this truth soaking in, the clouds parted and the sun shown brightly for about five minutes. Gods ways are a mystery to me most of the time , but this seemed like a clear confirmation of the truth that was just for me at a time I needed it. Thank you Jesus!I know us hiker dudes are supposed to be tough guys, but in that moment I wept and as I walked, I was wiping tears from my cheeks. Tears of sadness that I had lived so much if life not really believing this. Tears of joy for the realization that I face nothing in my future without him by my side. Side by side! Me and Jesus! Always!If that wasn't enough, as I was hiking on with tears still running down my cheeks I encountered a couple from Atlanta Georgia who were day hiking. As is the custom on the trail we stopped and talked. They asked my trail name and the man said, I don't know why but God just put it on my heart to pray for you."" Is said ""that would be awesome"". They gave me a few more words of encouragement and hiked on. They knew nothing of my thoughts nor the reason for my tears, but again I was over joyed with what I have concluded was a divine appointment arranged by God to confirm this truth in me. So I hiked on ""Side by side"" with the one who knows me best ( with all my screw ups) and who loves me most. ( screw ups and all)","Dicks Creek

Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524688,"Inspiration:My inspiration was taken from Nora today. She is a fellow nature lover who, I first met when she was 2 or 3 years old. Her mother, Terri (RIP), was an unmarried mother who was young and unprepared for the rigors of motherhood, but tried hard to care for and support Nora. Having been abused by male figures in her life, she adopted a lesbian lifestyle and relationship. It added to the confusion for Nora and when Nora was 13 the relationship between her and her mother had groan difficult at best and toxic at worst. So, Nora was voluntarily placed by her mother in the residential facility where I worked and she lived as a part of our family until she finished High School. Upon graduation from High School, she attended college where she prepared for a career in forestry work. Unfortunately, she was involved in a couple of abusive relationships with two different marriages that left her confused and living life with two wonderful daughters. Inspite of the abuse, Nora, did not let that keep her from raising her children well and giving them a loving, supportive and appropriately structured lifestyle. She focused on becoming a world-class Mom inspite of some early struggles in her life. Her oldest child is a bright young college student and and her younger child is a intelligent student as well as an accomplished ballet performer.Today Nora works as a Supervisor for the U.S. Forestry Service and oversees their computer software systems that track numerous data from across the U.S.Nora, here's to you! You have always taken the lessons from each chapter of your life and applied them to the next in a way that has lifted you and your family to achieve more, learn more, love more and live with integrity. So proud of you!Today's Journal:I started the day at Muskrat Creek shelter. It was an uneventful night having arrived the day before about 3:00 and having my choice of campsites. I camped near a stream where I could hear the gurgling of the water which always makes for some great soothing background for a good night's sleep.When I woke up it was cooler than it had been but the weather forecast was for a cool and partly sunny day. I did the 6.4 miles up to the top of Standing Indian Mountain where I stopped for lunch. It was uphill the whole morning with the last 3 miles from Deep Gap to the top having an elevation gain from 4.341 to 5,500 feet. the good thing is that it was a steady incline instead of a series of ups and downs. So I was able to pace my self and made the 3 mile climb with only one rest stop.When I got to the top I met ""moses"" a fellow hiker from Louisville. He is a young man in his 30's and was most engaging so it made for a enjoyable lunch time while we ate and soaked in the sunshine. Well, I soaked in the sunshine. He is a fair skinned read head so he was pretty much keeping himself covered the whole time to avoid sunburn.The remainder of the day was a steady down hill walk to Carter Gap Shelter. but temperatures were dropping all after noon and periodically a cloud would come over and drop a few snow flakes. It made for great hiking conditions all afternoon. By the time I reached Carter gap at about 3:30 p.m. I had logged my longest day with 12.5 miles and I felt really good. No feet problems, no joint problems.I decided to to walk the .2 of a mile down to get water. As my routine had now become, I filled all my water containers so that I would have enough water for dinner, breakfast and to start the hike the next day. With water chore done, I began to set up my tent and find a suitable place to hang my food bag to prevent bears from getting it. I had just finished setting up the tent when Junko and Oscar came in to camp and settled down near me. Oscar had phone service and his wife told him it was suppose to snow starting at 6:00 pm with continuing chances of snow until 2:00am the next morning. The temperatures continued to drop as I set up camp and at 5:00 I was bundled up with all layers except my sleeping clothes on. I boiled some water to make chicken flavored rice and noodle dinner that I had found in the hiker box at Top of Georgia Hostel. I realized quickly why it had been left behind. It was pretty much tasteless and I had to force myself to eat it all simply because I needed the carbs it provided. I finished with a peanut butter and nutella smeared tortilla rollup. By then it was beginning to snow, so I offered to share my bear hang with Junko who showed me how to do the PCT Bear Bag method. It was slick and made it impossible for bears to get the food and was easy to retrieve the next morning.On cue the predicted snow arrived only instead of flakes, it came down in ice balls that looked exactly like the little styrofoam balls or as Conductor described it, ""white sprinkles"". I quickly packed it in as temps had dropped below freezing and I was getting cold. The temps dropped into the low 20's overnight with an accumulation of about an inch of snow.","muskrat creek shelter

Gramps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524793,"Today's Inspiration:In spite of our best preparations and valiant efforts, there are inevitable set backs along the way. Our present vision of how things will role out moving forward and what actually happens is often different. So remaining flexible and resilient is a valuable asset. Heaths, boyhood hopes and dreams for a healthy uninterrupted and undisturbed family life were destroyed when his father left the family for another woman. He carries the scars of that painful separation and disillusionment to this day. His response following the family breakup was one of disrespect for other's authority in his life and disrespect for the law. At 14 years of age he stood before a judge in south central Kansas who gave him a choice. Go to jail or go to a children's home in Oklahoma. He chose to go to a children's home. The experience there gave him an opportunity to focus on his education involved him in extra curricular activities and sports. Though the experience with his House parents left him wanting and still confused, he didn't give up on learning about and pursuing healthy family life. He was determined that he would not repeat in his own children what he had learned from his own family.After completing an undergraduate degree he explored Youth Ministry during which time he met and married Cindy. After a few years he moved from the Midwest to Nevada and went into the real estate business with his brother. That period of time proofed to be a difficult and trying test of his will to pursue a healthy relationship with his wife and nearly resulted in the end of the marriage, but instead of throwing in the towel and moving on, Heath began to fight for and save his marriage. That journey to healing was met with difficult times and times of self reflection that were painful and hard, but worthy of his pursuit. He didn't give up. He deepened his trust with the Lord and he opened himself up to become more vulnerable with his wife. As he did, he began to grow closer to her and to the Lord. Fearing fatherhood and its responsibilities, Heath put it on hold for many years. But after a time of healing and growth, Heath and Cindy gave birth to a little girl about 4 years ago followed two years later by the birth of a son. Heath's love and commitment to his family is unmistakable and strong. His children adore him and he loves them and their mother like Christ loves them.But that's not all. In December of 2014 Heath returned to the children's home that he was placed in as an adolescent to train and prepare for leading that organization. Today he is the Executive Director of Cookson Hills Christian Ministries and is committed to helping other children who come from hard places have an opportunity to experience a ""Better Story"" in their lives. You can check out this organization at www.cooksonhills.org. It is an amazing setting of a better story for children whose lives have been impacted by the trauma of abuse and neglect and who deserve an opportunity to discover that, with the help of God, their life trajectories can be altared so that good wins out over the bad.Here's to you Heath. Today's Journal:I packed up at daylight to get out of camp early. Most of today's hike would be fairly easy except for a 400 foot climb in about .2 miles up Albert Mountain. I felt great as I approached the climb, but started to feel the effects of it almost immediately. It was a boulder laden scramble that often left me trying to decide whether to use my hiking poles or put them up and go at with hands and feet. For the most part I was able to pick my way up it with the use of poles. The reward at the top was breathtaking. There was a fire tower at the top and it had a 360 degree view for some 50 miles in all direction. It was clear and sunny so I decided to stop and eat lunch while enjoying the views. After lunch, I packed up and headed down the other side of the mountain which was a gradual down hill for the next 4 miles followed by a gradual mile uphill and another gradual down hill to finish at Rock Gap.About 2.5 miles into my descent from Mount Albert, I was walking along on a fairly flat stretch when I decided to pick up my pace. As I pushed off of my left foot to initiate the change in pace, something popped in my left calf and I immediately hit the ground with my calf muscle immediately tightened up in a knot. I knew it was more than a typical cramp in my muscle and wasn't sure how I might go on, but I knew I couldn't just sit there.So, I got to my feet and pressed on. I could place my left foot forward for a half step and then move my right foot up to it without pain, so I decided that was the way I would have to hike the remaining 3.5 miles. I calculated that at top speed I wasn't likely to make it to Rock Gap in time to catch the afternoon shuttle at 4:00pm, but I was determined to try. There is a saying among AT hikers, ""the Trail Provides"". I experienced it first hand. After about an hour and a half of downhill hiking that took me all of about a mile, a German Hiker whom I had met previously at the Georgia/North Carolina state line. I didn't know it then, but he was formerly a German Army First Responder who was well trained and combat experienced with assisting fellow soldiers. When he and his friend hiked up behind me he immediately recognized that my gait was gimpy and asked if he could help. When I told him what was wrong, he immediately shed his pack and started rummaging through it to get his, very well equipped first aid packet. He had a heat patch and some stretch wrap and gave me some Ibprofen to take. The fix provided some immediate extra support that reduced the pain and improved my ability to place weight on the left foot. He packed up and went on ahead of me. Thanks Mr. German Army Man! He was my good samaritan and it was a huge blessing.
As the Ibprofen and heat patch kicked in, it enabled me to make better time. That coupled with the blessing of gradual slopes to climb enabled me to get to Rock Gap at 4:10. I thought I had missed my ride so I called the Hotel. They said they were going to pick up again between 5:00 and 5:30pm. Since it was 12 miles to town, I told them I would wait. 
But once again the ""trail provided"". Within about 5 minutes of hanging up, a people mover type bus rolled into the little parking spot and said they were headed to Franklin. I hopped on board, paid the $3 fee and in about 15 minutes was at the hotel. What a blessing.
I didn't know how serious the injury was, but I know i wouldn't be able to hike for at least a few days and possibly a week or two. I only had another 2 weeks on the trail at best for this section, so instead of trying to go home for a week or so and then return for a week, I decided it best to end my section hike at Franklin and pick up more sections as time and job allow in the future.
I am writing this on the 25th and having now consulted with a Doctor, I think the right decision was made as he expects that it will be a couple more weeks before I would be in condition to hike.
All in all, the experience on the trail only whetted my appetite for future sections. It also convinced me that I am probably not well equipped to be away from family and friends for the extended period needed to do a thru-hike in 6 months. 
The spiritual, emotional and mental benefits of having undisturbed extended time to think and talk with God were undeniably the most important aspects of the trail for me. In spite of injury, God had been with me in a deeply life altering way. I am more deeply in love with Him I have a deeper understanding of his presence with me no matter what I confront and no matter if plans go as I set out. He is there. We are ""Side by Side"" from this point forward.
That made it all worth while.","Carter Gap Shelter
