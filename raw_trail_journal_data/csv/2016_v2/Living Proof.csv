Living Proof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480747,"Well, I've finally decided to take the plunge and start this journal. I've had way more hesitation about chronicling this journey than actually taking it. I am not an open book and sharing my thoughts and feelings, even about hiking will be a challenge for me. However, it's important for me to share this journey with my family that I'll be leaving for five months or so. It's also important for me to share this journey with other cancer survivors, especially my fellow brain cancer survivors. I know that I felt like I got a death sentence when diagnosed, but I've learned to truly live since. This trip is me making dreams and hopes a reality. I'll be leaving Connecticut on 4/20, two days after my little sister's wedding(reason for the later start date). Officially starting my hike on 4/21. Gonna leave it that for this first entry.

Living Proof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480881,"Hey folks,    I finalized decisions on a bunch of gear options that I've been wrestling with for months. I managed to keep the weight down without breaking the bank. I'll get to updating my gear list in the next few weeks, but enough about gear.    To answer the question of ""why"" a 5 month thru hike. The seed took root roughly three years ago. I was working for the state of Ct. and in the process of attaining my high 3 years of income, which your pension is based upon retirement. I have somewhat of a compulsive personality and was averaging between 70-80 hours a week at work. I got so bad that I would have feelings of guilt if I turned a single shift of OT. Talk about having your priorities out of a whack! Anyway, I was working an OT shift in the intake unit surrounded by walls of concrete wondering about not only the institutionalization of the youth we supervised, but myself. 20 years in this type of facility and throw in another 5 years worth of OT shifts and there is chance you may need to be reintroduced to the ""real world"" when it's over. I thought I could do the total opposite of being surrounding by concrete walls. No walls at all! A friend and co-worker hiked the trail in '07, Circadian, so I was familiar with the idea. That was it! Ever since it has been a permanent fixture in my future plans.    Well, the future is now. After spending the past year or so dealing with brain cancer, my health is currently in a place where I can take this journey. I was granted a disability retirement from the state of Ct., so work is no longer a responsibility. The past year has provided an excellent way to toughen up mentally for this trip and I'd leave today, but I'm really not a fan of freezing my ass off!",,The Why of it all,"Feb 01, Sun",0
Living Proof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480990,"Well, I thought I might comment on my relative experience related to hiking, eating and sleeping in the outdoors for roughly 5 months. Let's just say if this was a job interview, I probably wouldn't get the job! The last time I camped out was in or around 1984 on a cub scout trip. The only two things I remember from that trip was making a slingshot and a kid falling through the plywood covering the backside and stinkhole of the outhouse. Chest deep in shit, truly unforgettable.     With that being said, I really don't want to look like a total fool my first day out there, although I'm sure I wouldn't be the only one. I'm planning on taking several shakedown hikes here in Ct. when it warms up a bit in March. Some reps on setting up and breaking down camp will save me time when it matters and my ego some slight bruising down the road. Till next time,",,Relative experience,"Feb 04, Wed",0
Living Proof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481403,"It's been an interesting week. The good news is that most of gear is in hand. I still need to get a few items, which I will work on in the next couple weeks. My physical preparation hit a wall as I starting having headaches last Thursday, which culminated in a headache on Tuesday that ended up being too severe to handle. I ended up in the ER and required Morhine to get a handle on the pain. Of course, with a history of brain cancer, I underwent the full battery of testing. In the end, they found nothing unusual from tests and think it was caused by sinuses or simply a first time migraine. I'm to follow up with an ENT doctor tomorrow and hopefully figure what caused this issue and avoid it in the future.   In addition, I threw my back out shoveling snow Tuesday before the headache really kicked in. Setting up some PT to get that fixed up. In the meantime, I can barely get a pair of pants on, never mind shoes! Luckily, my start date isn't this week and still have plenty of time to recover from these two recent setbacks. I've already overcome quite a bit to take this journey, what's a couple more things to add to the list? Hopefully, my next entry will all good news!

Living Proof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481914,"Hey all, roughly two months out from start of my hike. I booked my flight, bought a sleeping bag liner and some cordage for my bear bag since my last entry. I've had 4 PT appointments for my back and it's not 100%, but getting better. I experienced another severe headache yesterday morning, 9 days after my first severe headache. Despite lacking an official dx, I'm pretty sure I'm having Migraine's. I have no prior history, so I'm puzzled why I having them all of the sudden. What's one more obstacle to overcome?   I read Grandma Gatewood book in last week being down with back. I was vaguely familiar with her story, but really enjoyed learning her entire story. She was one tough woman. One thing that stood out to me reading her book, was how lucky she was that she never got in serious trouble with exposure, although she very well may have. This particularly stood out to me, as the weather down south is so unseasonably cold and nasty. It seems those who have already started are being smart and taking care not to put themselves in harm's way. As I have prepared for my hike, exposure seems to be the one danger that seems like a real possibility to me. I figure the proper gear and proper sense will avoid any real danger, let's hope we all have both!Chernobyl",,Progressing slowly,"Feb 20, Fri",0
Living Proof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/484395,"I haven't posted in a bit. I find hike prep entries rather mundane and don't seek to bore the masses with my own preparation, but I'll indulge you today. I've really been enjoying reading everyone's journals as they commence their hikes. I've been walking without my pack for roughly the last three weeks just to introduce my joints and muscles to a different type of motion than I'm accustomed to. I was glad I did it, as even without a pack, my hips and feet whined a bit after 8-10 miles a day. Today, the first day of spring and one month from my flight to GA., I donned my pack, fully loaded minus food. The added weight of roughly 21 pounds was noticeable. With snow in the forecast for this afternoon and a check-up with my Radiation Oncologist, Dr. Salner at 11:30, I sneaked out for a quick 5 miler this morning. My pack carried well on my hips and felt very little weight on my shoulders and back. I was definitely moving slower with the added weight. I have a very steep road close by that serves as my hill trainer, which is a mile to the top and back. Without my pack, I was doing it in 15:40. With my pack on I turned in a 18:20. Hoping to get out 4-5 times a week over the next month and get training hikes up to the 12 mile range. I think this will be ample time to get my gradually get my legs into shape and will help me avoid the trap of doing too many miles early in my hike that my body isn't ready for. I have competitive and somewhat obsessive personality traits that will make low mileage days tough for me to swallow. Thus, pace myself now with steady training.

I thought in this entry, I would address the one question that I had no answer to until this past week. The question was,""How do your kids feel about you going on this hike?"". My answer was, ""Good question! I don't know. I should probably ask them.""   So I proceeded to ask each of them what their thoughts and feelings were about my hike and being away from home for 5 months?    Owen, my youngest at 13, had a tough time finding words for his feelings. So much so, I had give him a feelings chart to read through. Once he got the chart, he said, ""brave(of me), astounded, impressed, and overwhelmed(at prospect of my 5 month absence).""    Colin, 14, proclaimed, ""Amazing! Monumental! Dad, it's not like your one of those Dad's that say they are going to the grocery store and never come back, it's good.""    Andrew, 19, sent a text from college, ""I think it's awesome. I'm so excited for you because I know how well you've prepared for it. We will support each other when you are gone and meet up with you on the trail as well as in Cape Cod. I'm used to being away from home, but it will be different being home without you there for the summer. No matter what, I'm overly excited to see you when you finish your trip and hope to hike the entire trail myself one day. I look forward to hearing things you learn along the way and could not be more proud of you.""    So, there it is.

The scan came back clear, so structurally everything is where it should be. I am going to try to set up tent later today and get my pack on. If I can do without to much pain I may pass on traditional PT and go with trail PT as I still have time to complete my thru hike this year.

Living Proof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506139,"So my last journal entry actually posted! Another sign that it's time to get back out on the trail. Physically, my left shoulder has about 50% range of motion and 35% strength. My Scapula is healed and an MRI revealed no other major structural defects. This unexpected good news left me with two options; stay home and continue with traditional PT or hit the trail and hope it improves while hiking 15-20 miles a day. I went for a hike yesterday with my pack on, all be it 8-10 pounds lighter than normal. I was able to get it on and off without too much trouble. Hiking with my pack on felt great. My hips carry the true weight of the pack and my shoulder had no discomfort.     As for my Rabbit pic, this little guy let me walk right up to him about an hour after I got my MRI results. He seemed totally unafraid as he continue to eat grass while keeping one eye on me as I crept closer. I have not been confident about getting back on the trail this year and I'm really quite shocked it's happening. A part of me has been afraid to get back out there after my fall. Was it just chance that I fell? A slip that could have happened to anyone and just happened to be me? In all honesty, I think I carry a greater risk as my balance on uneven terrain just isn't what is was before my surgery. I'm sure there are some people who would suggest that maybe I shouldn't walk the remaining 2040 miles of the AT, many of which are over uneven terrain and take up a hobby like quilting. After my diagnosis, I felt a fear like I have never felt in my life! A fear that could take over your life. I made a promise to myself to never let that fear make a decision for me. So thank you Rabbit, for reminding me not to live in fear.   Spend today getting all my gear back together and packed up. I got ride out to Kent CT and Mt. Algo for tomorrow and will hopefully be hiking by 10 a.m. Plan is to head north, hit Katahdin. Catch a ride back to Kent Ct. and hike south to Stecoah Gap N.C., where I left off in May.","home

The first couple hours proved Ct. isn't a total cakewalk. My legs and hips groaned a bit after 11 weeks of basic inactivity. I was soon saturated with sweat and tried to drink enough water to balance out what was coming out of every pore of my body. My first real challenge of the day was a steep big boulder decent after the St. John ledge. The decent required a butt slide approach at many points. Using this tactic with limited use of one arm really got my heart rate up as I felt on verge of losing control at several points. When I finally got to the bottom, I had to ask myself how much of the fear I had just experienced was from true risk and how much was from experiencing a serious fall 11 weeks prior that I haven't fully healed from?    The trail flattened out and I walked along the Housatonic River for several miles continuing to bake in the heat. I took a break around 1:30-2 p.m., after getting my pack off, I was having some noticeable pain in my left shoulder. I got going again and hit Silver Hill campsite around 4 p.m., I considered going further, but was feeling seriously overheated.     My entire body was feeling sore, which is actually a feeling a like. My shoulder, however, had waves of shooting pain even at rest. Set up tent, eat some dinner and was heat finally subsided around 7:30. It took me a long time to get to sleep as I continued to self analyze my anxiety/fear on some of the descents of the day. Finally got to sleep around 10 pm.

I had about a mile hike to Rt. 4. My legs were feeling unsteady and hit a couple rock scrambles that again, without a left arm were a challenge. I started to see every ledge as an opportunity for misfortune. In my mind, it was no longer a question if I would fall, but when I would fall. While every thru hiker experiences slips and slides, I couldn't help but think about an actual fall. Even a slip or slide, with the need to protect my left arm, could be a problem. That was it. I was defeated mentally and knew it. As well prepared as I was in April, in every aspect, I now felt totally unprepared. I hiked down to local Citgo and made the call of shame to my wife telling her I was done and asking her to pick me up. Part of me knew that my shoulder wasn't ready for the vigors of the trail, but I was hoping that getting back out there would fill the large void I've felt since being forced off in early May. After getting home, I slept 4 hours, emotionally exhausted from battling such a difficult decision. My shoulder had waves of pain the rest of night, giving me a feeling that I made the right decision.

I hit the trail as close to well prepared as I could have hoped for. My first 150 miles on the trail were great and I felt totally unstoppable. I've never felt so self reliant in my life. It was everything I dreamed it would be and more. I met a lot of great people and the trail community was simply incredible. My fall and subsequent injury derailed what I had no doubt would have ended at Mt. Katadin. Coming home to heal proved to be the biggest challenge as felt a gaping void, having my hike so suddenly interrupted. This void was probably the biggest reason I made the hasty, perhaps ill-advised reason to try to get back on the trail this year when I really wasn't healthy enough to do so safely. I'm glad I did it though as I feel some closure now and the ""void"" doesn't seem so ever present. I'd like to thank everyone who rooted me on. From family, friends to total strangers, it gave me untold strength to have your support. Special thanks to Mike Lockett, my AT alumni consultant. Lastly, I would like to thank my wife Kathleen for her steadfast support!

My focus will be supplying what I enjoy reading.    I attempted a thru-hike last year, falling 5 miles shy of Stecoah gap and fracturing my shoulder blade. I attempting resuming my hike in July with a frozen shoulder and totally out of shape, which was an impulsive and poor decision.   I'm a 27 month brain cancer survivor and my most recent MRI two days says nothing is growing up there, so I'm hitting the trail again with this good news. I toiled with the idea of whether I would keep a detailed journal(it's not a blog!) this year. In all honesty, it's a chore to keep up with. However, the feedback I got from countless people was pretty amazing. They could here my voice and feel like they were, where I was. One of my original motivations to keeping this journal was I thought it would be a way to capture my voice, experiences on a epic adventure, and insight to who I am as a person. I may well not meet my grandchildren and having never met one of my grandparents I would have loved to had something like this to capture who he was as a person.   So, between now and April 7th, there will not be many entries. Although I will share pics and experiences from upcoming trip to Iceland 3/24-28!   For those of you already hiking, I'm really enjoying your journals.

Living Proof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523574,"I feel compelled to do an entry on gear and more importantly weight of gear. I listed most of my gear last year and I'm sticking with pretty much everything. One thing that really stood out last year was the incredible amount of weight people were throwing on there back to hike up and down mountains all day! I felt myself that I could have trimmed some fat as fully loaded up with water and food, I was in about 33 pounds. I went through all my stuff today and got rid of this and that. With out food or water, I came in at 19.4 pounds, should be able to cut that in Virginia when I send some cold weather clothing home. I usually carry between a half a quart and two quarts of water at any given time, so that's another 1-4 pounds and you really don't need to carry more than three days of food for the most part, as resupply is readily available with some exceptions of course. So I'll have 1-3 days of food in my pack which will be 2-6 pounds. So, depending on how much water and food I'm carrying I'll have a pack weight somewhere between 22.5 and 29.5 pounds at any given time, with the hope that I can drop some of that weight when I hit Virginia. I know some go much lighter and some go heavier, but I'm pretty happy these numbers.    I did want to mention one gear change that I would have liked to make but haven't. I went with a 20 degree synthetic fill bag last year, kept me warm, but doesn't compress as well as down. Result is the weight in your pack tends to carry higher than I would like. I may grab a down summer bag and switch out at some point as weather warms. So, that's my two cents on weight and gear, I'm sure I'll have some gear and packweight trail tales to share come April.

Living Proof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523896,"I just wanted to take a moment to touch on physically preparing for the trail. If your not a seasoned camper or long distance hiker, there is big adjustment to just about everything when you start living in the woods. This is a lot to handle for most and having to deal with a full body revolt due to lack of physical conditioning, I'm sure pushes some over the edge and into quitting. I am a gym rat and do all sorts of conditioning and weightlifting to stay in shape. With that being said, absolutely nothing gets your body, especially your legs ready for Ga. like putting on your pack, finding the biggest hill you can and walking up and down it. After a month of intense gym workouts, I've spent the last week going up and down hills with my pack on. Wow, I'm feeling it! This training is not enjoyable and monotonous, but you'll be thankful once your hike starts. One other point. Practice using your trekking poles!

I agreed naturally as you simply don't turn down opportunities like that. Let me say, Iceland is the most naturally stunning place that I have EVER seen. I have 5-6 pics in my photos, but hundreds of photos couldn't capture how beautiful the country is. We did a tour with Goecco, which was excellent. Their tour guides are non traditional, creative, free thinkers who I thought personified the Icelandic philosophy of the under 50 generation. On a rather large island with only 360,000 inhabitants they have an app that can be used at the end of a night of drinking to see if your too closely related to continue on with the evening! Classic. Anyway, it was blast and I would highly recommend to anyone. Expensive, but what isn't.     I'll be in the air this time next week on my way to Ga., excited and ready to get started.

Living Proof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525872,"So, I thought I would touch on the much discussed topic of hiking pace and how many miles one should attempt to tackle, especially early on in a thru hike attempt. First off, everyone has natural hiking pace that is kinda genetically programmed into them with a variance depending on fitness level. to hike with someone slower is a mental challenge as your body naturally wants to go a bit faster and to try to keep up with someone naturally faster puts an undue stress on your body physically. This doesn't even take into account personal preferences on frequency and lengths of breaks throughout the day. This is one reason I have the utmost respect for couples hiking together. It has to be a challenge in this facet alone.   As for mileage, I shot out the gate quickly last year. My knees suffered greatly around the 75-100 mileage mark but were improving. My fitness level was high, but it's very difficult to prepare your knees. Utilize your hiking poles and keep as much weight off your knees as you can. I did take a mean fall as I literally fell ""off the trail"". Of course there was conjecture that my pace had something to do with this and I really couldn't tell you one or the other. I'm still not sure why I fell. Pack shifted? Hiking pole slipped? Regardless, I feeling a calm about this year's hike that I didn't feel last year. Mileage was my top priority last year, this year it isn't. Don't get me wrong, I have a naturally fast gait and hate setting up camp super early in the day, so I'm sure I'll be doing more miles that most, but I feel no rush to get this hike over with or type of deadline with the exception of winter of course. Truth is everyone does it different and no one is wrong. Living Proof",,Thoughts on hiking pace and mileage,"Apr 01, Fri",0

I've been busy running different errands and trying to take care of any loose ends that I can. I've been under the weather for the last 5 days, so I've backed off all training and just giving my body a break before the real work starts.    So one thing I find interesting about thru hiking is the caloric equation that one must keep in mind while hiking. Your burning 4,000-7,000 calories a day depending on how far and fast you hike each day. It's very hard, I'd say nearly impossible to make up for this calorie loss. A 40 pound weight loss is not unusual. I've read one trail journal this year where the guy has lost 29 pounds in a month!! So, I've gotten a record of my pre hike body weight 189.6. Skeletal muscle mass 89.1 and body fat mass 34.8. This was a humbling measuring, but I did it the name of science!

Some really forgiving trail today with gradual ascents and descents. It made for for quick miles as reached Betty creek by 2:00 pm. I was tempted to push on, but sore back and feet made me decide to stick with the moderate schedule I have set for myself through the smokies. I saw some wildlife today! A snake, not very exciting, and coyote, much more exciting! Ours paths would have crossed on the trail, but we both detected each other at the same time and froze. He was probably about 40-50 feet away through a grove of Rhodadendron. As soon as I took a step closer, he bolted and was quickly out of sight. Betty creek gap is a cool campsite with countless sites among the large Rhodadendron, however, with no privy it's apparent that many have dug inadequate cathodes and used them. Wipes and tissue were visible from laziness or small animals. This kinda ruined the natural beauty of sight! Living Proof","Muskrat shelter

I caught the shuttle with Ron Haven, who was a pro wrestler from 1975-1981. Very interesting character and true friend to the hiking community. I began hiking at 9:25 am with light rain that was actually quite pleasant. All the small woodland creatures were no where to be seen, with the exception of snails. They must have known something I didn't! By 10:15, it was raining moderately hard and I was beginning to get really wet. The moderate to heavy rainfall would continue for 4 straight hours. It was my AT baptism! Temps were only in the 50's, so stopping meant you chilled quickly. I just kept moving to stay warm. It was slow day for 3 reasons. A night in town causes sluggishness, mostly uphill all day, and the rain. Only made 11 miles, but I was cautious how my feet would handle being saturated all day.

We both kept walking out opposite directions and exchanged a glance as we passed. After he passed me he hopped right back on the trail and continued sobo.

Ok, so rain was expected last night and I have had a couple positive experiences in shelters in the Smokies. Took my chances last night at groundhog shelter. First sign of trouble was that shelter platform was bowed to the middle. Second was the guy that rolled in and out his stuff neighboring mine. Three warning signs I missed. First, he was unable to keep his ass crack contained in his shorts! Second, he said he was a hot sleeper. Lastly, I actually asked if he was a snorer and he deferred to this 70 year old guy who answered ""no"", but there was no conviction behind it.    The mayhem began around midnight as the snoring began. The bow in the plywood would have me fighting gravity all night from sliding his direction. I had to pee around 2, I found my head lamp and when I put on the red light all I saw was a back full of black hair!! I recognized that was the first time on my journey that I wished I was home next to my wife, instead of this pseudo gorilla! Guess he does sleep hot as he had apparently stripped down. My fight against gravity was now one of life or death. I questioned whether it was worth pitching my tent or hiking in the middle of thunderstorms? I decided against it. He was fighting gravity as well, however instead of gently sliding back to his spot, it felt like a walrus was convulsing against the plywood shaking the entire shelter. This sick game would continue for hours, as I was able to steal a few hours here and there. I was awake around 5am after a powerful and vivid dream involving my late mother in law. We were at a hospital and she gave me a big hug and wouldn't let go for some time. I thought she about to tell me something when I woke up. I hoped it wasn't an omen that someone was not well or maybe she just came to comfort me through my terrible night. As I lay there contemplating my dream my now mortal enemy topped himself by farting so powerfully I thought he blown his sleeping bag off or shit himself! I was done. I got my headlamp and starting packing up. The rest of the day would be far less eventful, thank God! Only real highlight today was Max patch, which is a bald with outstanding 360 degree views!

Waited a couple hours for rain to ease up and Alex the caretaker drove me up to the trail, where I had to walk a mile back to the trail. It was 8:45 and as soon as I started hiking the rain picked up. The forecast called for lesser chance of rain at 9 and none at 10, it was very wrong. It rained consistently from 9 to noon. My feet were soaked and my running shorts were soon impersonating a soggy diaper. I made my way up and down flat pond mountain and proceeded to make my way around Watuga Lake, which turned out to be massive. I finally reached Watuga Dam and the sun was trying to come out, so I stripped off all my clothes except my shorts and set them on the asphalt in an attempt to dry them. It wormed them up at least. I got back at it. During the morning, there was little need to hydrate or snack as in cold rain you just keep moving to stay warm. The hike from the dam was a pretty good ascent and I failed to increase my intake of water and food. Then I breaked with some younger guys and make the mistake of trying to hike their speed with depleted stores of energy. I ended up totally crashing as I found getting up the smallest hill a challenge. Everything from the day added up and I was clearly at my low point during this hike. The perfect storm consisted of wet feet all day, chafed thighs from wet shorts, dehydration and lack of food, strained my rt. hamstring, and was made to feel old and slow by faster younger men which was only a wound to my ego. It was at this point, that I was unsure I could even make my goal for the day. Then there was the riff raff gathering that was 4 miles beyond my goal. At this point I had 5 miles to the shelter and 9 to riff raff. All I really wanted was to be in dry clothes and in my tent. However, being the obstinate person I can be, I consciously choose to push the 9 miles to riff raff and overcome the physical and mental obstacles that had mounted to hit me like a tidal wave. I pretty much got to the shelter on my own, but knew I couldn't make last forum on my own. For the first time on my hike I would need a hiking partner.

She was game and off we went past the last shelter. We mostly talked, which is a great distraction from hiking! She was cool and around 8:40 we had to put on out headlights to guide our final 30 minutes off hiking. As we approached the gathering everyone yelled,""Hikers!"". We were greeted with beads and bracelets, but no food and they only one beer and one soda  we split both. It was a bit anticlimactic, but my greatest reward was overcoming my lowpoint. As a cancer survivor, you attain a PH.D. level in this skill and I was truly tested today. to my surprise I hiked 26.5 plus one mile to the trail for a whooping 27.5 day!! I thought it was only 22.

The day started walking through a pasture with a bunch of cows and it was one of the few highlights of my day. No vistas or anything interesting that was photo worthy. I did run into some awesome trail Magic provided by a thru hiker from 1989. He provided pulled park sandwiches, lemonade and chips. It was a huge physical and mental boost at around the 12 mile mark.   The terrain was very moderate and after yesterday's huge mileage I was need of easy hiking.

I'm zeroing tomorrow as my legs really need a rest, rumor is free massages in town in the morning. I'll be finding that for sure!! I've chosen to avoid famous tent city as some other hikers told me not to set up on baseball field because kids on psychodelics will run over your tent. I would surely pummel some young hiker on drugs if they woke me up in such a manner. So I'm tenting at woof chuck hostel to avoid the choas. Rest is far more important to me than the party seen.

It was the authors tent, where a collection of authors who have written about the trail had tables. I passed 4 or 5, unaware of who they were or what they had written. Then came a table with a little old man sitting there. It was Gene Espy!! I have read enough AT history over the last few years to know I was about to meet an AT legend. Gene was the second person to thru hike the trail, seven years after the first, Earl Shaffer did it in 1948. He agreed to take picture with me and asked how my hike was going. Compared to Gene, the rest of the vendors were eh! I ran up to food city to resupply and ran into Raidon, who I met on last years hike! He completed his hike last year and said he heard about my injury. Hiking community is a very small world. After resupply I ran numerous other hikers who I haven't seen in weeks. It nice to see familiar faces, even though I may not see them again this hike. I've decided to hike out of Damascus tomorrow as there will be a huge bubble of hikers leaving Sunday and Monday.

The hike relatively easy today, which isn't usually the case coming out of a town. There weren't many photographic wonders today, just a lot of green as spring has fully sprung. I did see a grouse, I think? Little smaller than a chicken brown and white right off the trail, it ran down an embankment before I could get a picture of it. Supposed to dip into the 30's tonight, so I'm wearing pretty much all my winter clothing in my 45 degree bag. Met an older section hiker zag foot at first shelter today who had tried thru hike but failed and now sections, as he makes a bit further north every time out.

First off, last night was very cold. My 45 degree bag didn't do great in the mid 30's despite having all my clothes on, but I survived. First task of the day was climbing white top mountain. It was below freezing up there and the wind was 25-35 with gusts of 50. I was hiking my butt off in my little saucony running shorts! Pays to grow in New England at times as I only saw one other person in shorts all day and he was from Minnesota. After white top it up mt. Rogers, the highest peak in Virginia. I had lunch at the top at a shelter. Then the day turned around totally. Grayson highlands! Take away the wild ponies, the landscape by itself was amazing. Add the ponies, probably my favorite section so far. It was super rocky, but I didn't care. Areas that beautiful give me a rush and I can hike endlessly it seems. The baby ponies looked like stuffed animals. The were a real sight. I would highly recommend a trip here, although some moderate hiking is required to see the park. I hiked on to the shelter I had planned to stay at, but it was at 4100 feet and still windy, so I hiked another 1.7 miles to get down to 3500 feet and totally out of the wind. Hoping I'm a little warmer tonight as this is the last predicted cold evening. I also hit the 500 mile mark today! Today was a 12 hour day and legs felt strong all day.

I awoke to 38 degree weather, which isn't exactly encouraging one to jump out out of your sleeping bag and start your day. However, I still managed to get on the trail by 7:15. After the highs of the Grayson Highlands yesterday, today was pretty mundane. Hiking followed by more hiking followed by more hiking. The most interesting thing that happened to me today was during my lunch stop just past a lovely pasture. As I was preparing my lunch I heard a day hiker approach from north, turned saw who it was and resumed my food prep. Suddenly I hear sticks snapping and he veered into the woods about 15 yards from me. I was thinking,""huh, pretty nice of him to actually piss off the trail!"". As a thru hiker I piss off the trail from the trail. Then I see him quickly unbuckle his backpack. Uh oh, if I see him start to dig I'll alert him of my presence as he has given indication that he has seen me. Before I know it his trousers are dropping! He forgoed digging a hole and whipped back around not what to see what was coming next. I couldn't believe this guy was taking a shit 30 feet from where I was eating. This obviously put a real damper on my lunch. He finished and kept coming north, so whether he saw me before the act, he definitely saw me after. He didn't say a word, nor did he the two other times I saw this day. While the most memorable event, the highlight of the day was being able to order pizza delivery from the Mt.

Wasn't very good, but better than trail food. 16 person shelter is sure to be nightmare with snorers tonight and with rain expected I'm going to camp illegally on back porch of visitor center that has cover.

Made it down there and ordered the breakfast plate with a large coffee. Back to the trail and a flat 8 miles to the next shelter where I had lunch. There is a thing that some hikers experience in VA, called the Virginia Blues. One, Virginia is the longest state on the AT, 468 miles. Two, the payoffs of views and points of interest are less common than the previous 3 states, especially when it's always foggy! Three, if your not doing bigger days you could be here for 5-6 weeks. I'm trying to push through in four. The advantage is Virginia is far flatter than the previous 3 states, making 20-25 mile days very doable.

I was soon at the captain's. This is a house across the river from the trail that lets hikers tent and they can have a soda on the back porch. Only catch was I had to sit on a swing attach my pack to a caribiner and pull myself across the river. Still raining and the river much higher than an hour ago, I had to do it, just one of those unique AT experiences. Went over had a soda, came back.

I seemed to be making decent time and felt good about my 5 pm deadline, then came dragon's tooth! Awful! It was a long rocky ascent that jogged up and down a ridge line. It was hot, but my time crunch had me skipping water breaks and just pushing. I finally reached the rock monolith and it was actually pretty cool. Took some pictures and off I went. I thought the short 2.4 descent would be cake! Ha! More like rock climbing, trying to shimmy down sheer rock faces. Most definitely the most technical climbing thus far, and their was a good .7 miles of this nonsense.

My phone had a voicemail from my wife with some encouraging words that really lifted my spirits. I decided that I would go back to the trail and forego the day off. I walked up to the Buena vista motel and the guy let me charge my phone, but wouldn't let me use the wifi :/ Still managed to get on the Internet and update my journal. As I was leaving I called my wife for a quick conversation as I quickly got a hitch back to the trailhead. With some food and a little love from home I was ready to hike! I got back on the trail a little after a 11 and contemplated what went wrong with the day before. All week I had anticipated having a bad day on my anniversary, so I think it was part self fulfilling prophesy. It was also just a big rare dose of self pity! As a brain cancer survivor, I see self pity as the ultimate waste of time and life, so I didn't even realize I was mired in it most of the previous day. Anyway, hiked pain free and fast. I'm back on track to hike into Waynesboro on Wednesday. Life is good!Living Proof","Brown mountain creek shelter

Hikers are looking weary and unenthused.       I got a very early start on trail at 5:30 am. On deck today was the Priest, major descent, followed by three ridge mountain. The last 4K mountain I will have to climb till northern New England. The Priest wasn't bad, nor was the first 2.8 of three ridges, but the last three were for real. It felt like the final exam of the southern AT. It took about 110 minutes to go three lousy miles and I was hiking hard. There had been talk of a pub after three ridges, and after such exertion, food, water, and beer was irresistible. I had two beers, a bacon cheeseburger and informed the bartender to keep bringing waters till I urinated. I think I had 7 glasses before I broke the seal! Called the wife to check in. Pub was crawling with hikers as they had free tenting nearby. I really wanted to get an early start so I hitched back to the trailhead. I figured I could find a stealth(nondesignated campsite) campsite within a mile or two before dark. As it turned out I couldn't. It was just rock with hill above the trail and hill below. I kept hiking with no other options, hoping I wouldn't have to resort to night hiking on such rocky terrain. An injury would be really bad as no one would be coming along likely till morning. It was thrilling though in a way. As the trail goes mundane at times, adventures like these keep the blood pumping. I eventually found an overlook that a semi flat spot where I get tent up and I caught a magnificent sunset! My plan worked out perfectly. I managed to get some good pictures and set up camp justo before last light. It's like living a choose your own adventure book I read as a kid, but real adventures!

I'm staying at stanimals 328 hostel, which is unique because it's in a total suburban neighborhood. Waynesboro is the biggest trail town in the AT with a population of 45000. I did laundry, showered and weighed in for the first time in 400 miles or so. 165 pounds, that's 24 pounds lost so far! The crazy thing is I eat all day, usually taking in at least 250 calories an hour. Problem is I'm burning 500-600 an hour. Simple math game I'm losing as is any else doing serious miles.

I swear it was raining sideways at one point. I would hike through for roughly an hour as the trail turned into a river and I would walk through puddles that engulfed my entire feet with water.

My foot was super tender to start the day and it took 80 minutes of hiking for it to loosen up. After that, the miles went by rather quickly and I made the road for town by 11:30 am. Got a hitch within one minute and got dropped off at a shopping plaza. Hit cvs for ibuprofen and Tylenol and ordered a pizza. As I was waiting outside the pizza shop, a fellow came by and asked if I was hiking too? I said I was and he asked if I hiked in on some route or the other. First off, this guy was homeless and walking roads. I explained I was hiking the AT and he began to tell me about all the nice roads to walk. I couldn't fain interest or attention on anything he was saying and he rambled on for another minute or two until before taking the hint.

We were coming down the many stone steps as we descended and talking about grandma gatewood when I heard a crash behind me! It was bob who had caught a toe on a root or rock and went flying face first down the rocky trail. Unbelievably, he claimed he was unhurt, not sure how though.

Got some expertise there I thought, so I walked down to her place which was filled with hikers. Turns out Mary has lung cancer and it may be spreading to her brain. I explained how it was for me and answered a couple questions she had. I asked how she got her start being a trail angel. She said in 2001, she found herself homeless. She had a car and job, so she decided to tent at the campground in town from 3/15-9/15 to save money.

I hitchhiked into Hamburg PA for Burger King, a small resupply and socks and sock liners at Cabela's. I found several instances of angry and impatient people over the silliest things. It was strange as I never witness that on the trail, just me cussing at rocks. Everyone was in rush and disgusted at any wait and slow thing. I've learned to be slow. Going anywhere by foot is slow. Georgia to Maine is slow, but I've definitely learned slow isn't bad. We go to fast in our world today. I saw a beautiful buck hiking my last 5 miles of the day and he was the first deer in PA that hasn't bolted at the slightest noise or sight of me in this state. One other thing about PA, there is a lot of poison ivy along the ridge lines here!! I don't know how I haven't gotten any yet. Only hiking 9 miles tomorrow as the Common Ground retreat center has generously offered me a free night after reading my trail journal and were interested in hearing about journey on and off the trail. After 8 days of no laundry, one shower and 199 miles hiked I'm ready to clean up! Off to bed.Living Proof","Hertline campsite

It was roughly 6:30 am and the sun, clouds and Rolling hills were just beautiful! I did have roughly an hour in some pretty rocky terrain, but view made me not so cranky about it. Past the Pinnacle and boom. Rocks were gone and smooth road! PA is weird like that, it goes from hell to heaven in an instant. I got to Eckville shelter and gave Mike from Common ground retreat center a call letting him know I was there. He arrived 15 later and I thanked him again for his very generous offer. It turns out his father passed from brain cancer at the age of 31, when he was only 2 years old. I hate hearing stories like that, but that's real life. It can be wondrous and tragic. Myself and a couple other hikers went into town for dinner at an Penn. Dutch restaurant. They had scrapple on the menu, but I kept it traditional American. We are having an early breakfast tomorrow here and hopefully back on trail by 8ish. I'm less than 2 weeks from home and super excited to get there. Next 12-13 days are going to be grind though, bugs are coming out. Just another thing, rocks will ease up in a few days and bug infestation will begin! I've given up on the notion that I'll ever get to the ""easy"" part of the trail. Something will always hurt, I'll always be damp, and something will always be challenging physically or mentally during my day hiking. That's what makes it fun though for us twisted folk.

My warriors blew their shit at history last night, but oh well, miles to be had. It was 92 today and the first 7 miles were uphill and/or rocky. I didn't make good time. The gnats are out and they go in my eyes, nose and mouth. It was a very dry stretch today, so I had to conserve water in the heat and with my late start it got hot quickly. Today was the worst day of rocks yet. Google knifes edge AT and you will find pictures of the scariest part of trail I've hiked yet. Having suffered a fall and severe injury last year on far less imposing trail and balance and depth perception not being my strong suits I was not comfortable with the terrain, but just pressed northward. I did 24 miles today in almost 12 hours, by far my slowest moving day since I started, but I got to where I wanted to go.

Another trail journaler, conducter had set up his tent without the rain fly, so watching him wake to the storm was amusing as he scurried to get his sleeping bag and tent out of the rain. I hit the trail at 6:30 and I knew we had a 1000 foot vertical rock scramble to start the day out of Lehigh gap. It was legit rock climbing, which with a 25 pack and trekking poles that are rusted so they won't collapse made it interesting. I managed to get through it and was proud for doing so. There only one part that I was really apprehensive about, but found some good hand holds and just went for it. I noticed the same thing yesterday on knifes edge that could really detect my body odor during these very fearful climbing moments! I have two theories on this. One is that you really can smell fear, a fear phormone is released or something. My other theory is your adrenaline heightens your senses, thus I can smell what I usually don't, in which case, I smell horrible all the time! If anyone can explain this phenomenon I'd appreciate it.    After hiking through the superfund area, which is where they dumped huge amounts of zinc from smelting for 90 years, I hiked into trail magic at little wind gap. Hot dogs hamburgers, soda and water! The trail here is super dry and water sources are unreliable or off trail, so this took the pressure off rationing water as tightly for the day. I had 15 miles to wind gap, where I needed to resupply my snacks, get water, hydrate and eat town food. It was rocks the entire way and around 2:30 I fully lost my shit by myself in the middle of the woods. The going was so slow, despite my best efforts to move with some pace, just too many small to medium size rocks. I screamed,""F*** these f***ing rocks! I'm over this f***ing shit!"".  I just had to let my frustration out. I stayed frustrated till I hit wind gap, but I made it. Next challenge, hitch to town. The north is not hitch hike friendly, but I got a ride after 20 minutes and 250 cars not giving a second thought.   To food giant for 28 snacks or so, then to Burger King, where for $11 you can seriously grub! Over to the gas station to hitch back to the trail, only about 10 minutes this time. I had a very steep ascent out of wind gap and was dripping, but was just looking to go a couple miles and find a smooth spot for my tent and call it a day. Found my spot set up and it's 8:15 now as I wrap this up. Little music then bed.

Today wasn't as bad as the last two for my last 13 miles or so in PA. However, after missing a turn off for the trail and hiking down a service road a half mile before realizing my mistake I was regretting committing to white blazing the trail. White blazing is hiking every step of the trail. So I hiked back up the service Rd., found the trail and hiked down into Delaware water gap. I caught a ride down to the apple cafe for two scrambled eggs home fries toast and a stack of pancakes. Hiked up to Zoe's for some minty mint ice cream before I left town. I crossed the bridge along I-80 and there it was, I was in NJ! I never thought I'd be happy, never mind ecstatic to be in NJ. I had to do some road walking to get to the state park, but saw a black bear less than a mile in, which was a great start. The terrain remained rocky making my pace a bit slow, but there were some good views and sunfish pond was nice. I called it a day a bit earlier than I planned, but rain is expected in the morning, so I want to get an early start so I don't have to pack up in it. Besides, I was feeling dehydrated by the end of the day and I didn't want to push it. 7 states down, 7 to go! The next five should go fairly quickly.

Cheeseburger, fries, iced tea and Dr Pepper later I was refreshed and ready to add on to the 18 miles I had already hiked. I got on trail at 3:20 and motored! My first full day out of PA and I was feeling like my old self, positive vibes and big miles. I rattled off 11 more miles by 8 pm and called it a day. I was savaged by mosquitos setting up camp though. I saw some turkey, another bear and a friendly deer today as well. I did chat with two thru hikers who seemed to not be enjoying their hikes. One traumatized by the rocks of PA and the other by the rains of Virginia. Maybe they will make it to Katadin maybe they won't. They didn't bring me down though!

Friendly as ever, they seemed annoyed by my presence, so I moved on quickly. Hiked past the highest point in NJ, which has a huge Phallis erected on it. Rather strange, actually. Stopped at the Maury property, where a farmer has erected a shelter outdoor shower and privy for long distance hikers. Cool place, had an early lunch there. The afternoon was great as I hiked through the Wallkill wildlife preserve and then some other park that was all boardwalks. It was very different and different is a thru hikers best friend some time. I ended my hiking day early as I was planning on going into Vernon NJ. Stopped at the farm before hitching in for ice cream, but that ended up being a mistake as a bunch of hikers showed up as I was getting ready to go to town. Luckily 5 of us got a ride from a lady with a mini van to the church hostel in town. 10.00 dollar donation to stay and I tented outside. Shower, handwash hiking clothes and a quick resupply. I decided to join some hikers I met earlier in the day at a pub down the Rd called scullys. We could hear live music from the church, so it sounded promising. It was a hopping place! Jam packed with people we were able to find a table and order. Everyone had a drink and soon we had split four pitchers of beer! This was more than I had planned on drinking, but hey! I inhaled the food I ordered and made the perilous walk back to the church stopping at Burger King for more food on the way.    Vernon is the first trail town I've been in that have actually seen black people! All these little towns and nothing but white folks, so that was noteworthy. I did see two much older women at the bar that had to be in there eighties jamming out to the live music in their pearls. I got a picture with them as everyone else was 20-60 years younger than them. I may have a slow morning tomorrow due to excessive beer intake and total disorganization of my stuff, but I'll be cruising into NY after mile 9 tomorrow.

Traffic in Vernon was significant late into the evening and I've grown accustomed to the quiet of the woods. A pesky mosquito was in my tent which further disturbed my rest and the town birds started their singing at 4:15 am. All in all I got 4 hours. I had breakfast at the Mixing bowl with Rucker, a 6'3 female thru hiker. Packed up, hitched out of town and was on trail at 7:30, which is good for getting out of town. It was nine miles to the NY border, and quickly another was in my rear view mirror. NY wasn't welcoming as injured over huge boulders for a couple hours exposed to the sun. However, I hit trail magic five times today!!! That was huge in staying hydrated and having water as NY is very dry right now. I came to a stream and a girl was sitting there soaking her foot. She looked at me and said,""you look familiar!"". She replied,""umm..we had breakfast together this morning!"" It was Rucker and truly a brain cancer moment! Surgery and radiation can make recall tricky at times. It was funny though. I met Bigfoot who aiming to complete the trail in 3 months and a week! He has been flying since Springer, but I hiked with him a bit or tried at least. It turns out we have been within days of each other since Damascus. Made me realize just how consistently I have been putting in big miles. We had very similar hiking philosophies, but keeping up with for five miles was enough for me! He's just too fast. It was a rather tough day on little sleep, so I was happy to get my 23 and call it a day.   Bear mountain tomorrow then the trail is supposed to ease up, but that could just be another trail rumor.

I probably had my best nights sleep on trail last night, which was sorely needed. The morning was rough though, as I was lethargic and the miles seemed to pass slowly. The state park was nice, but when your grinding out miles fighting weak legs and heat, it's hard to bask in the beauty of your surroundings. Your focus is on putting one foot in front of the other and follow the blazes. I created a fantasy/expectation that my sister would surprise me at Bear mountain. The thought fueled me for few hours when I needed it. She wasn't there, but this is a good example of the mind games one must play with yourself to move north some days. Bear mountain had pristine trails, but all the Spanish people cooking was torture!! The is a very large Eastern European population here and I saw more drop gorgeous women today than I have this entire trip! That includes trail and trail towns. I actually scolded and broke up a little make out session one couple was having on the trail.

Which is 8:32pm. I hit the trail at 5:50, breakfast at the Appalachian deli was awesome! The profile for today seemed like it could make for quick miles, so abandoned my promise to only do 23. 28 miles on any type of terrain takes time. The deli and pizza place at mile 28 closed at 8, so I figured I better get there no later than 7:20. At 4:45 I hit RPH shelter, which was really nice and I could have had pizza delivered too. Rain was starting. Most people would think this would the easiest decision, just stay! I have a tendency for these little adventures and some work out better than others. I decided on adventure this evening. As I set out from RPH the rain immediately increased, no big deal. I had 5 miles with a good bit of climbing, so I couldn't use the alpine pace. I straight hauled ass. I shocked myself how fast and long I could sustain this break neck speed. I took one short break to chug a liter of water. I left RPH at 5:05 and got NY 52 at 7:05, but where was the deli? Checked my guidebook, .4 east, shit! Finally got there and bought a half gallon of OJ and ordered a pizza. There is supposed to be tenting allowed behind the building. Wrong! A meadow a mile more away from the trail! No way! Eat my pizza and drank my OJ. Walked back to the trail determined to find one piece of suitable dirt to set up my tent. Started north and within minutes I look to my left and there was a gravel dead end. I bushwhacked through a bit of forest and found my home for the night. Warm and dry finally! This was more of a misadventure and I wish I had stayed at RPH. Win some, lose some.

The rain became heavy and my tent seemed to be having some serious sag issues as well as intense condensation issues from within. I decided to get up at 4:15a after sleeping horribly due to traffic zooming by only 50 feet from my tentsite and my inability to properly stake my tent. As I exited I found the problem as the two bottom stakes of my tent near my feet had dislodged during the night. What a sad sight. My tent was a soaking wet and sand covered mess! Got to hike though. I packed everything up hiking in my sleep shorts and shirt as I refused to get into the wet and sandy clothes from the night before. I tried hard to not imagine how much more all my wet gear weighed than it did when bone dry. I was hiking by 5:20. I hiked over I-84, I thought if I could get a ride east, this freeway would bring me to within 5 miles of my house. Get a grip, you homesick ninny! I hiked on reaching the first shelter, slightly hating the dry hikers waking and just starting their day. As I moved on, I thought about the state of my tent and the serious time commitment it would take to dry all my stuff. I also considered my original plan to only go home for the holiday weekend. The kids would be all over the place and between various parties it would over before I knew it! I've been hiking my ass off for 70 days just to get here and see them, why not just go home today? Get my stuff dry there and spend some extra time with them?    I called my father in law to see if he could grab me and he was available. The plan was on. I still wanted my arrival to be a complete surprise though. He picked me up at 2:40pm, as I had hustled 22.5 miles in soaked socks and shoes. Went and showered and laundered some clothes at his house and called my wife's good friend to get here out of the house. They were having drinks at the local Mexican joint. I was delivered to the drop off and sneaked into the bar. I have been planning this surprise for weeks in my mind as I walk through the woods all day. Her reaction was priceless. Total shock! She blurted something and embraced me. She wrapped her arms around my skinny torso and I could feel her beginning to cry. ""Oh my God, you need to eat a cheeseburger!"", she said through her mini sobs of joy. It's easy to shock someone you have been with for more than half your life, so I was proud to have pulled it off.    My two oldest sons came up, but my wife couldn't fool them. It was great to see them. My 16 year old is as tall as me now, shoulders a bit broader and voice a bit deeper. I had to stay up way past my bedtime, 11:15pm, to see my 14 year old. Whoa! He has really sprouted up and has super long hair. The difference was shocking. Great to be home and give my body a much needed rest.

We went for breakfast at Dog lane on the UCONN campus followed by a round of Frisbee golf on campus. We used to play all the time on my dad's old 20 acre property in Chaplin Ct., so it was great to have a three generational match.

I was feeling achy on the way out and thought I may be coming down with a cold or something. We then went to our friend's house, the Tavano's for a picnic. When we got there my body aches had worsened and I had developed the chills. We had been there an hour, when I asked my wife to run me home as I was struggling to even stay awake. Kathleen wanted to take me to the hospital, but I needed to sleep. I got home and slept for the next four hours, woke up for an hour and then slept the rest of the night.

After reading up bit on Lyme disease, it seems a foregone conclusion that I have been infected. The hospital did blood work, chest x-ray, pumped me with some fluids and ended up sending me home with a prescription for Docycycline. An anti-biotic used to treat Lyme disease. All I can say about Lyme disease is that it really sucks! Fever and chills, take tylenol, pour sweat out every pore on your body.   Joint and muscles aches making getting out of a chair, couch, or bed a painful experience. Then lastly fatigue. I slept after getting home from the hospital from 5pm to 10 pm, then back to sleep by 11:15pm to 8:30am the next morning. More frustrating, is the fact that there doesn't seem to be a playbook for Lyme disease recovery. Obviously, I will not be doing any hiking until my current symptoms have been alleviated. When that will occur? I really don't know at this point. Some people recover in a couple weeks, while others suffer with symptoms for years. I'm hoping I was infected very recently as that would indicate a quicker recovery, but only time will tell. The good news is that's it's only 7/4! I have a lot time to make to Baxter state park.

I had another healthy sweat reaction when I woke up, but after that, the cycle of chills, fevers and sweats was over. I took antibiotic doses 2 and 3 of 28 today. Joint pain didn't seem quite as bad today, although I did have significant headaches and a really stiff neck. On a positive note, I binge watched Game of thrones season 6 and it didn't disappoint! From what I've read I can expect a full recovery in a week to several months. 739 miles to hike by 10/15 and my health is complete limbo.

Fatigue is lessening with increased energy. My joints are slowly starting to loosen up as well.       The lowlight of my day was driving my son Owen,14, to lacrosse practice at rush hour! I have often spoken to other hikers how any stress of a thru hike is far less stressful than sitting in traffic. Traffic in Hartford was complicated by a Florida/Georgia Line concert in the Hartford area. My task was simple. Drive from Newington through Hartford to Windsor, then drive through Hartford again to attend my monthly Brain tumor support meeting that I was lucky enough to be home for. This journey ended up only taking roughly 70-75 minutes, but I had reached my breaking point shortly after hour into my drive. I thought to myself,""It took a good 8 hours of steady hiking on the worst of PA. rocks for me to lose my shit! Now, I'm sitting in A/C with music, clean, with a full tummy and I'm losing my mind after an hour."" Interesting.    Luckily, my next stop was the highlight of my day. Hartford Hospital's brain tumor support group. I have attended these meetings off and on since my diagnosis. They were extremely helpful for me in the first months of my diagnosis. You get to meet other survivors and hear about their struggles and their successes. Your not the only one whose life has been turned upside down and many of these people actually seem happy! Unthinkable and hard to fathom for the newly diagnosed, as it was for me. I was able to meet positive, grateful, and amazing survivor's. It gave me a goal. I wanted to be like them. I was able get there and I give some credit to this group, including it's survivors and caregiver's who attend and the facilitators who run the group.   Last night's group had a very large turnout and everyone shared stories of success or fears about what may lie ahead. I met new attendees and saw other's who had overcome major hurdles since I've last seen them. Very inspiring. I left the meeting feeling energized and my mini meltdown in traffic was a distant memory.    See GP tomorrow, hoping for all good to neutral news. Living Proof","Home

Living Proof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541434,"I definitely felt like my energy levels were higher today than they have been since my Lyme symptoms have presented last Sunday. Therefore, I felt guilty planting my ass on the couch all day. I decided to tackle the never ending family laundry pile:/ My wife, Kathleen, hates doing laundry! I'd figured I'd throw her a bone. It was not very enjoyable, but I knocked out 5 or 6 loads. Retirement and home life is not all glamour that's for sure. I drove to my childhood home town of Southington to keep my GP appt. and make sure I'm good to go back on trail once I'm feeling up to it. The ER made it sound really important that I follow up with my GP, but it seemed like a waste of time. Hartford Hospital hadn't even forwarded my Lyme test results. Dr. Glaser said all my bloodwork looked good and my white blood cell counts were a bit off due to whatever tick borne illness I've acquired. We agreed to just call it Lyme's, although he said it could be one of the others, that I can't remember the name of. The Doxycycline I've started will address any and all tick borne illness I may have, so it's a moot point I suppose.   I was a bit early for my Dr. appt., so I made a quick detour to see how my childhood home was looking. On the way, it struck me that a street very close by was Whipporwill Rd.! I always found that street name very unusual as a child, coming from a none birding family. Now I associate the Whipporwill with me cursing the nocturnal bird from my sleeping bag as I try to fall asleep or am awoken in the middle of the night. You could offer me my dream house, I would never accept it if the address was Whipporwill Rd.!   I've decided I need to take off my little girl panties and get my big boy underwear back on and get back on trail Monday morning. I'm feeling well enough to get daily miles in. I'm not 100 percent, but no is after 1500 miles. The pull to get north is very strong. I wasn't sure what my motivation level would be after I got home because since GA., I've been hiking just to get home. Katadin was just too far off to focus on. My motivation to keep going is still very strong and one of the reasons I'm not taking more time at home. Right now, the pull is the White mountains. They are one of the undeniable highlights of a AT thru-hike. Big climbs and decents, no swithchbacks, blah, blah, blah. After hiking this far, tough sections, climbs, decents, boulders, etc. are just par for the course. I just hike them. Outside of a 30 mile section in Maryland, there is no easy part of the AT I've decided. There is always something making the day a challenge at times. In the beginning, it's not having your trail legs and being introduced to actual mountains for those hikers who live in flatter areas. Then the longest state, VA., where you are what seems like forever and isn't nearly as flat as was rumored earlier in the trail. PA. rocks weren't nearly as bad as I expected for most of the state, but it only takes a day or two of very rocky trail to leave an impression. I actually really liked NJ, but I was in and out in a flash. NY was steep little up and downs and sun exposed rock with no water. Of course, throw in violent storms here and there. I have stayed much dryer than others, I've heard there were two to three straight weeks of rain in VA., while I was burning through NC/TN. Throw in freezing cold, heat waves, bugs and you have a long list of elements making daily life more difficult.    Of course, I should mention that I have absolutely enjoyed everyday of my hike except one! Outside of that, I have had only bad/challenging moments here and there that were short lived. I think the fact that it is never easy is one of the reasons I have enjoyed it so much. Maryland was the easiest, but it was also packed with day and weekend hikers, making it feel crowded and not so special. I often think while hiking that the designers of the AT, specifically Myron Avery had a severe form of Masochism! Whenever I hit an easy section, I think he must have taken a vacation when they did this section. Maybe this means that a successful thru hiker must enjoy suffering, physical and mental, at some level. To masochism and successfully finishing this last 739 miles! I'm rambling...Living Proof","Home

I was up at 5 am and Kathleen woke surprisedly easily as we were up and out by 5:45. Couple stops later we were at the trailhead by 7:15. A hug and a kiss later, I was off. I have to say I wasn't thrilled to be leaving her, so I just ripped off the band aid and bee lined it for the trail. 12 zero days is far too many, my trekking poles felt awkward and it took me a couple hundred yards to get used to them again. The plan was to hike 16 miles and meet my dad at 2:30, so he could hike a few miles with me. Up hills weren't bad, my quads will be a bit sore though. The downhills were my problem today. The time off and residual Lyme effects made some brutal downhills more brutal. Good way to get back into the pain of a thru hike. Why wait, just jump into it. I was only 10 minutes late for my dad, which approximating how long it will take to hike 16 miles isn't an exact science was pretty good. We went to lunch in Kent and got ice cream, then back to the trail for a short hike along the Housatonic river. I appreciated him making the effort to join me, even if for a short section.   We said our goodbyes and I continued on another 3-4 miles.

Living Proof,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541952,"Day 972016 total miles hiked 1498.5    Today, I'm going to tell a story. It may be rather long winded, but the backstory goes back more than a year or two and many miles hiked in between, not to mention hours/days/weeks/months of self-reflection walking through the woods or laying peacefully in my tent. This is the story of why one thru hiker decided to end his hike more than 2/3 of the way to Katadin.    The seed to hike the AT took hold in 2011-2012 in the midst of working 70-80 hours a week in a correctional setting. I thought it would be a great way to deinstitutionalize myself upon retirement. My retirement arrived 5 years earlier than expected when I was diagnosed with Brain cancer. As soon as I realized that my career was over and my life may be much shorter than I had expected, hiking the AT became a growing obsession and desire. It was one of my main motivations getting through surgery and treatment, and still getting to the gym everyday for a full workout. 2015 was going to be the year! I arrived in Ga. in great shape, but a fall in NC and fractured shoulder blade ended my dream for 2015. I spent the next month depressed as hell. I had invested so much physically, emotionally, and financially and it was over in a stumble. I finally pulled myself out of my funk and quietly planned for 2016.    Despite my failure in 2015, my burning need to hike the trail remained and when my spring MRI revealed my brain cancer was still stable it was a go. After a rough start in Ga. dealing with ungodly blisters, I was back it. My number one priority everyday was DO NOT suffer a hike ending injury!     One night lying in my tent, dreaming about Katadin, I really gave some thought to my obsession. No other hikers seemed as hell bent on getting there as me. Many seemed fine ""just getting as far as I can"", which I couldn't fathom. The truth finally bubbled up from my unconscious, after close to two years of my growing need to do this hike. I have dealt with the many fears that come from a brain cancer diagnosis, but there was one left. One I hadn't even realized I had. My biggest fear was being forgotten if/when I die. This hike was my way of ensuring that I'm not forgotten. I'm far more afraid of that then death itself. This new insight, didn't change view on the hike. Let's go make sure I'm not forgotten.    The next chapter in this story occurred at the Fontana Hilton just south of the Smokies. A hiker named the Trek AKA The savage rabbi, yes, he is an actual rabbi. It was passover and he invited hikers at the shelter to partake in a Seder ritual, where the story of the Jews exodus from Eygpt is told. What made this Seder unique was that he correlated the story to our hikes. After retelling the story, he asked those present. What is your Egypt? What is holding you back or down that you need to take this journey?For me, my new found fear was my answer. It was powerful to actually speak it. I and others there were remarkably candid for a group that were mostly strangers. What is your promise land or Katadin mean to you? Again, this was easy. It means I won't be forgotten by those I love. The last question was the one that really tripped me up and I didn't have an answer to. The answers that everyone gave on what getting to Katadin meant to them. Could these things be attained without actually getting to Katadin? At the time, that was a moot point because I was getting to Katadin, no questions asked. The other main thing I took from that night and have thought about hundreds of times since, was what the The savage Rabbi shared. Now in his early thirties, he had planned to hike the trail with his dad in his mid to late teens. His dad passed away from cancer before that plan came to fruition and he was finally hiking the trail roughly 15 years later. Time hadn't worn off the impression his father had on his life or the love/bond they shared. Let's just say his words made an impression on me.    It was around this point in the hike that I decided that Katadin was just too far off to focus on, so I changed my focus to what I missed most and that was my family. It turned out to be a great motivator as I blazed north. I soon passed all the people that started when I did. Then I was passing hikers that started in late march, then mid march, then early march and even some who started in Feb. Many hikers questioned the miles I was hiking and I always gave the same answer. ""I'm not trying to out hike people, I just want to get home and see my family."". Despite dealing with endless foot issues, my push never stopped. Up at first light and hiking 13-15 hours a day without a 2nd thought. Let me say, I'm not a fast hiker! Young women in their 20's would often cruise by me or pull away from me when in my sights. I would just go all day long, eventually amassing a good amount of miles by the end of the day.     Now, I'll jump to today. My second day back on trail after 12 zero's that included a home visit and the onset of Lyme disease, for which I'm being treated for.     I woke up this morning feeling surprisingly good. Much less sore than I expected! On trail by 5:45am. It was not long before I realized my head wasn't in the game. I really couldn't figure out what the issue was. I argued with myself for hours! I've been this sweaty, had dead legs, sore feet, been harassed by bugs many, many times before. Why am I feeling this way? First hypothesis, I was hiking to get home before, now I'm hiking to get to a large rock(Katadin). Wait, since when in the hell did I consider Katadin just a large rock!?! This continued on for a really long time, until my brain finally just shut down and I went into a thoughtless hiking trance for several hours. I passed through Falls village and the Great Falls and began my ascent of Mt. Prospect. As I reached it's peak and began my descent, it struck me. My push to get home, my time with my family, and now my time spent walking away from home. I realized I had already reached my Katadin. The savage Rabbi's story of his dad flooded into my mind, I don't need a Katadin summit photo hung on some wall in my house in order to be remembered. Just a picture of me with my family, together. My hike is over. I've found what I needed to find on this hike and I consider it a total success. Shortly after this revelation, I hiked into an open field, Rand's view which is stunning. Is the trail trying to lure me back with this view or giving me one final gift? I decided it was one final gift.    I've discussed with other hikers how could anyone possibly end their hike as far as Ct.? No one could ever come up with a justifiable reason. So this is one story on how it can happen.    I would like to give a special thank you to my wife, Kathleen. Without her support I would have never been able to leave home and take this journey. She didn't understand my need to do this hike, but supported it nonetheless. Hopefully, this entry will shed some light on what has driven me so hard for so long. I truly enjoyed my time on the trail. The beauty, wildlife, fellow hikers, trail towns, trail angels, hostels and the many other little things which make it so special. I'm sure some of you will be disappointed that my hike is over, but don't be disappointed for me. I'm feeling very good about my decision. There are plenty of other hikers to live vicariously through! Signing off one final time,Living Proof","Silver Hilll campsite
