Campsite17,724 steps   7.4 milesStarting off at Springer, most questions are if we’re goingto Maine or not. Our answer along with every other thru-hikeris “That’s the hope” or “We’ll see”. Nobody says “Yes”definitely because with only 17% of thru-hikers making it the whole way, we all have an unspoken clarity about our chances.Any rock or root stepped on the wrong way can end your plansin a heartbeat. The vegetation on Springer changes drastically from 10 feet tall Rhododendron creating the feeling of walkingthrough the Brazilian Rainforest and in another few steps surrounded by bare bark pines looming over a fresh pillowof needles giving my joints slight reprieve from the poundingrocks. We were warned about strenuous hiking to Neel Gap,so far it’s fairly easy as we went 7.4 miles after only planning todo 5 miles. Hawk Mtn. Campsite is a strange little refugee campstyle with campsites dug into the mountain as you walk down 0.5 miles to the water source. The privy has no door, but hey, at least it’s a toilet. Setting up our hammocks now surrounded bypeople we met on top of Springer Mtn. Until tomorrow!","Springer Mountain

We definitely pushed ourselves too hard today, but we’ll learn from our mistakes. I’ll have to remember howdifficult this was when Jenny joins us in a couple of months, we willhave our trail legs but she won’t. So I want her to set the pace anddistance for that reason.Today we got 3 separate moments of trail magic after 1 yesterday!The first was at Cooper Gap courtesy of “Courtesy” the organizer’s trail name. Here, I witnessed my brother do something I’ve neverseen…He ate an orange! The second trail magic was a randomolder couple I passed on the trail that gave us homemade chocolatemacadamian cookies, they were delicious! The 3rd magic was froma community of Mormons or Menonites [actually “Twelve Tribes”] who set up their beautifully handcrafted double bus at Woody Gap and gave us homemade bread, tea and hot dogs and chips. I swear, if this trend keeps up, we’ll never have to pack food – ha ha. Mom, Dad and Sarah are taking us to Suches tomorrow for pizza!","Hawk Mtn. Camp

Butwe survived and had our parents and Sarah pick us up to take usto Wolf Pen Gap Country Store in Suches, GA for some pizza asDanny had been craving it the entirety of Day 2. So we ate withthem, then said our goodbyes as they drove back to Marietta and we continued North a different way. We only went about 4 miles today because we pushed too hard yesterday and our bodiesneed a break. The only other option was to push on to Neel Gapas we aren’t allowed to camp between Jarrard Gap and Neel Gapwithout a bear canister. It would be another 6.5 miles to Neel, sowe wised up and just stayed put. Unfortunately we got here at 3 PM (a bit early for our liking) and are camping near a privateresidence. Hopefully I’m not on their property or that they areserial killers preying on thru-hikers. Unlikely, but if they are, I loveyou Jenny ?.Okay, probably not serial killers since an old lady came out and offeredus water, but still you never know ha ha.","Woody Gap

We took our time up and down, sure, but we had plenty of time left in theday once we got to Neel Gap. We stopped there for 1.5 hours andate some lunch. Called Mom and Dad to give an update. Weplanned to hike another 3 miles to a water source, but missed it,so decided to go to the next water source. We didn’t realize it would be 3 more miles but that’s okay because we aren’t nearly as sore as Day 2. I guess those trail legs are starting tokick in! Our goal now is to head to Hiawassee for our 1st zeroday…showers, laundry, internet, phone service! That will be a welcome treat! We will either go 15 or 35 more miles before the zero day, depending on how we feel. Right now we feel good, but I might want a zero sooner so I can talk to Jenny and catchup with friends and family.My trail name might end up being Brain Function due to my brain’sinability to multitask at higher elevations.

Decided to push to thisgap in case we wanted to do a zero in town tomorrow. We’llcontinue on to Dick’s Gap instead before taking a zero. The mountain approach before Blue Mountain was the most treacherousslow hiking I’ve done so far. For about 2 miles, we walked along what looked like a past landslide where the stonescontinued to crumble over many years, creating a forest of jagged broken rock we had to attempt to traverse withoutinjury. Fortunately neither of us were injured except for the sore feet. That stretch took us at least 2 hours to complete,but we still made good time for the day regardless. There were4 of us in the same boat wondering where the next shelter was(the only landmark we all had) and cursing the AT makers for takingus through such a long painful path. But we made it and Danny and I went an extra 2.5 miles to make our goal. Overall this was a goodday, though a bit painful. We have 2 easier days tomorrow beforewe run out of food and head into town for our zero day. I look foreward to that!","Hogpen Gap

The temp eventually hit the 50’s but wind chill was around32 degrees the whole time. Today we weren’t too sore (no more thanusual), but we were extremely fatigued with little to no energy. We still made it pretty far despite this. I think town is a good motivationfor us. We’ve decided to go in tomorrow afternoon and stay fortwo nights. My main problems are possible blistered feet and randombloody noses. I think the cold dry air is causing those, but since I’veonly had a couple in my life, it would be good to give my body a chanceto heal. It currently looks like rain, so hopefully it stays away even though we are pretty much ready for bed. Only 5.4 miles tomorrow before wecatch a ride into civilization!

I had a thought over the lastmile. It doesn’t seem like we are in a civilized nation while on the trail. Not because of wild behavior from hikers or anything. Simply justbecause we go days without seeing the outside world and when wedo it’s for a brief moment of rest and relaxation. It’s almost like we’rein the wild tundra living off the land except when we encounter random villagers where we exchange niceties for food and shelter. It’sdefinitely a different and unique experience that will stick with mefor the rest of my life, even if I don’t make it to Katahdin.

Unfortunately, we were fully loaded,but still managed to fit one in our packs. Today was definitely the windiest sofar with 20 – 30 mph sustained and 40 mph gusts. When we weren’t in thewind, it was a pleasant day, otherwise it was freezing. Tonight will probablybe our coldest so far, but we decided to camp in a rhododendron patch to help protectagainst wind & frost. Temps expected ~ 20 degrees w/out wind chill. We made a firesince we got into camp so early. This wood burns super quick! We decided to stop so soonfor a couple of reasons. First, my knees have been in extreme pain all day. It’s almost unbearable on the downhills. The braces may be helping but I can’t be sure. I really hope this pain doesn’tkeep up and it’s an early ticket home for me. Secondly, one of my trekking poles snapped in the tension string so it was rendered useless. I walked with a stick for a mile before we foundthis place. I duct taped it up, so we’ll see if it holds tomorrow. Even after a painful, cold& malfunctioned day, camping next to a bubbling brook fading the sunset with the smell offire still permeating the air, those mishaps were worth it for this near perfect scenery.","Hiawassee, GA

It was a good decision because I woke up refreshed & ready to go. I took 2 Aleve to try and alleviate my knee pain (pain kind of ???)It seemed to be working great. We had a 3 mph pace for the first few miles, thena decent place climbing Standing Indian Mountain which is ~ 5,400 feetelevation & a 2.5 mile climb to the summit. It was a good view even with the cloudcover, so we ate lunch there… cheese & salami! The 3 mile walk down the mountainwent good as well. It’s amazing what not having excruciating knee paid can do. I was able to go at my normal pace & enjoy the scenery. Unfortunately it didn’tlast all the way to camp. With 3 miles to go, my right knee was killing me. Whenever I bent it is when the pain would strike. It felt like somebody shovinga knife into my knee with every step. I went from thoroughly enjoying my hike to having trouble concentrating on the path before me. I now know what theymean by blinding pain. I am going to continue taking Aleve or vitamin I because I do not want to quit. I just hope the pain subsides or at least lessens or else I might have to. Wish me luck!","Random Stream in NC

I wasn’t sure how my knee would fairtoday after an excruciating 2 days prior. They actuallyfelt pretty good all day with the exception of a mile walk along a cliffside. Definitely the worst place to have knee trouble… but that was our firsttrue cliffside walk as well! Dad definitely would’ve been terrified, but wewere just cautiously enjoying the views. I took 4 vitamin I (ibuprofen)throughout the day which probably helped my knee pain, but I feellike they are getting better as well. Danny’s right knee started hurting himtoday, which in turn is causing him slight discomfort in his ankle. Due tothese injuries, we’ve decided to take a zero day tomorrow to give ourbodies a chance to heal. We found a nice open space in a valley surrounded by a rhododendron lined stream to set up camp. It started sprinkling right whenwe got here, so we quickly set up or rainflies first so we could continuesetting up under cover. Anyway, into Franklin, NC tomorrow. PS – the climb up to the fire tower on Albert Mountain was our toughest test yet. It was set your poles aside & rock climb kind of hiking.Hopefully we don’t have to do that too often.","Carter Gap

We had a pretty nice camp spot last night at Winding Stair Gapnext to a stream. A girl showed up after us who is from Virginia but hasa strong English/Australian accent. Apparently her dad is English & she worked in Australia, so that explains that. Anyway, I bring that upbecause one of my goals on the trail was to give someone their trail name.I gave her the name Raindance and she loved it! The explanation behind itis when I told her it was going to rain all day tomorrow while at camp shesaid “yay!” and did a little victory dance. It was sarcastic of course but enoughto earn her that name. At the Budget Inn, us hikers sure have a way of turning any place into a little shanty town. We all immediately string ourbear lines on the decorative “columns” to dry out all of our gear. Our harddoor was also wide open for most of the day as was most everyone else’s. It’s a pretty neat gathering of people to witness & be a part of.","Winding Stair Gap

Definitely worth a stop if you zero in Franklin, NC! Both Danny and I have been goingby the trail names Ziploc [Danny] and RADAR [Nick] when people ask us, so theywill probably stick. We both felt well rested & virtually pain freeat the beginning of the day. I got a new knee brace to try out sohopefully it helps. We took a side trail to Siler Bald about 4 miles inwhich offered us our best views of the Appalachians yet. Thegrassy mountain top & rolling hills was reminiscent of Sound ofMusic without all the Nazis. We spent a few moments up there takingit all in. A few miles after that we took lunch at a historic ranger station built in 1913 about ¼ mile off the trail. It was a nice secluded spot since not many thru-hikers take the time to stop.","Franklin, NC

But from there the terraintook a turn for the worse. A couple more miles of ups and downslead to a point of the map called the “Jumpoff”.   This was putaway the poles & use your hands kind of back packing. The descent on that part of the mountain was 4 miles of kneeshattering steepness that left your feet screaming for mercy. It was difficult taking breaks due to gravity wanting to getyou to the bottom faster than you planned. The view fromJumpoff was nice with a single tree growing from stonelooking over it’s kingdom below. However, what followed was anything but. When we finally made it down, the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center) allowed for a much neededrest at the restaurant for a much desired burger. A bit priceyat $12, but it was huge and tasty and a healthy amount of friesaccompanied it. We couldn’t stay too long though since the day was nearly over and we had undiscovered forest ahead to try and find adequate camping before the light faded. We luckilyfound a flat spot amongst near cliffsides to set up ourhammocks around 7 pm. Since we just ate the burgerand didn’t have to cook, we had plenty of time to set up.Side note: The NOC seemed like a cool place to check out ifever in the area on vacation.","old road bed

The AT Guidebook said there were 3water sources up ahead, but they all turned out to befake. I had so little water, that I had begun rationingit and considering squeezing some out of the moss on the ground. We eventually did make it to a well flowingspring near a rockslide. Shortly after continuing our 3,000 foot elevation ascent, my right knee was strickenwith the intense pain I felt before Franklin, NC. I hadmy new brace on the left knee but switched it over rightaway. I believe this brace does help, but I still walked thenext 6 miles or so basically straight legged and only bentmy left to get me up and over rocks. I am going to buya 2nd brace as soon as I can. Despite the bad knee painand inevitable slower pace, we still managed 12 miles, whichputs us 14 from Fontana. We aren’t going to try to push ourselves to get there tomorrow since we plan on staying there Sunday night anyway thanks to our dadgetting us a reservation.

With no clouds or windto give us relief from the sun we took breaks for water in theshadows of trees. After that 1st ascent, the walking was fairly easy and fast – paced.

We both felt in good health all day exceptfor the 1st two miles where my knee was in pain. Fortunatelythat went away and it was smooth sailing after that. Today was a lot of hiking through pine forests that had a fresh cushion ofdead needles with fallen trees laying on top smothered in bright green moss. The dimly lit forest was reminiscient ofman-made ruins taken over by nature in Ancient Babylon. The only annoying part about this whole day was the onslaught of “stairs” put in place by trail maintainers.

We got up early to go to the post office to send stuff home and to the general store for a few supplies. Well, the Post Office ended up being too far away and the store too pricey. After the NOC not having our gear yesterday, it was no almost pointless to go into town. Oh well, it’s good to sleep in a bed to rest the body every once in a while. We got a free shuttle from the 1st Baptist Church back to Newfound Gap where I forgot to mention what happened yesterday.About a mile before the Gap, we got stuck behind some old person hiking group who were going slower than snails and wouldn’t let us pass them. Eventually the guide stopped to talk about an acorn or something so I used that opportunity to get on the steeper part of the mountain and blow past them all. It would’ve taken us a couple more hours at least to get to Newfound Gap if we were behind them the whold time. It’s a good thing we didn’t because at the Gap, we ran into a middle-aged couple who were uber excited to talk to us about our hike. They brought their two friends over to talk to us more and eventually we had a group of 6 or so strangers around us asking us questions and being genuinely excited about our answers. It was pretty cool to have such a captivated audience and that would’ve been enough of a treat, but we still needed a ride to town. So I asked for a ride to town, but they had no room in their car. So we just went and stood by our packs to try and get a hitch, then their car pulled up and started giving us whatever snacks they had! So all in all, meeting them was worth it. Okay, back to today. Most of the hike was gradual rolling terrain on the ridge, with not too many tiring sections. Our feet are killing us however due to all the jagged rocks we had to walk on. I believe that coupled with my Achilles pain that decided to pay a visit, slowed our pace a bit, but we still made it to our goal by a decent hour. The ridge walk was especially cool because most of it was about 3 feet wide with a cliff on one side and super steep hill on the other. Despite walking next to such dangers, I felt safe the entire time because of the thick Rhododendron growing on the side acting as a guardrail of sorts. There was also a lot of strong wind today foreshadowing the thunderstorm we expect tonight. Hopefully we stay dry!","Newfound Gap

It was surprising easy to do, plus I got to fill my water with runoff on my rainfly. I had my pack and self protected from the rain as much as possible and hung the rainfly from the front of my pack so I didn’t have to put it with everything else and get it all wet. We only did 5 miles today partly due to the rain/being cold and partly because I wasn’t convinced my body would make it another 8. But we only have 15 more to go to make it out of the Smokies, so we may try for that tomorrow!The only thing worse than the rain is the fact that we have to stay in a shelter tonight because a ridge runner is staying here and we aren’t allowed to hammock if the shelter has available space. We had to spend the 1st two hours listening to some hippie babble nonsense from the ridge runner and the 3 others. I’m pretty sure they have no idea what they’re talking about, just some talking points…they’d be great politicians! HaHa. To top it off, our arch nemesis on the trail, Thorn (refer to Ziploc notes) just arrived and immediately started being just as annoying as ever.

It’s a 9 mile hike to help if injured. They can’t evn basket you out with a helicopter, you’d have to walk 4 miles for that.","Peck's Corner Shelter

Not only that, but we recorded our longest day yet! Neither Ziploc or I have been so motivated to get anywhere so far as we were to get out of the Smokies. I still think it’s a beautiful place to vacation, but I will never backpack through the Smokies again. The bureaucracy and governmental influence is very restrictive for being out in the wilderness. Oh well we’re done and on to the next great adventure. Fortunately my knees and Achilles weren’t in pain at all today, allowing us to go as far as we did. We stopped at Standing Bear Farm for a quick bite. It is not what I expected. It looks like some random hillbillies attempt at creating a hippie commune full of thru-hikers. I know the owner just died of cancer and his wife is now running the place, but it seemed like an overpriced, unpleasant place to stay. The food was paid with the honor system, which is cool, but the guy you pay is the slowest thinking person I’ve ever met. We ate our food and got out of there as fast as we could. Slow Jam had the same idea and came with us to find hammock spots by the nearby creek. When we got to camp, Ziploc was freaking out about all of the poison ivy, so he made me pull every single plant he saw with my pliers, then wash them thoroughly in the stream. It was hilarious hearing him cringe every time I pulled one out. I’m glad I don’t get poison ivy like he does.

After starting the day with a 5 mile decently steep ascent in sunny with no wind conditions, we were pretty tired. Luckily at the top of that ascent was Snowbird Mountain. Why is this special you ask? Because trail magic was waiting for us! They were set up next to an FAA radar station with an assortment of homemade and store bought goodies. From there it was a 7 mile hike to Max Patch. It became something I needed to do after reading Clarity’s website, to camp on top of here. Fortunately, the mileage and weather worked out perfect to get here before sunset. The well maintained grassy bald has provided us with our best view so far on the AT. 360 degree views of endless ridgelines fade into a hazy horizon. The sunset was gorgeous despite no clouds and happened around 8 PM. It is currently 9:15 PM and the colors are finally fading into a starry night sky. Being on a balk like this affords us the opportunity to cowboy camp and wake up to the sunrise. I look forward to the morning colors with great anticipation. The sunrise is so much more beautifu than the sunset. My pictures will never do it justice, it is a must see real life experience. Oh, also being able to stare up at the night sky while falling asleep was a huge plus. I’m pretty sure I had a smile on my face when I finally dozed off.","Standing Bear Farm

Officially, it’s only 19.8 to the beginning of town, but since the AT goes through the entire town, we walked an extra 0.2 to dinner, so it counts! Interestingly enough, 4 or 5 days ago I mentioned that maybe we aren’t the kind of people that can do a 20 mile day… boy was I wrong! All it took was making our lazy butts leave at a decent hour. After Max Patch, there weren’t any good views of note, but the terrain was more difficult than expected. We started off with a pace of 3.5 mph or better (probably close to 4 mph) with some gradual downhill, but after a couple big ups, our pace definitely slowed to the point where I didn’t think we’d make it to Hot Springs until after dark. It’s a good thing we didn’t because after our showers we ran into our long lost friends Indy, Stretch, and Pyro. We were sure we’d never see them again, so it was cool we did. They were just finishing dinner as we got there so they invited us over to their campground cabin for beer they got from a dumpster. Let me explain… apparently a local business threw out a bunch of day old beer, so they went dumpster diving and picked out all of the craft beers, then the not-so-craft beers like Bud Ice and the like. The business saw what they were doing and put a padlock on the dumpster. Anyway, I went to go hang out with them after dinner for an hour or so, but Ziploc was too tired and went to the hotel. As I enter the campground, there were 3 guys grabbing beer out of the same dumpster so I guess the padlock was taken or broken off. Either way, they said “oh, you have to get some beer from there, you can’t leave withoug that experience”. I of course said yes, so with two of those guys holding my ankles, I grabbed a 12 pack of Icehouse beer. Really crappy stuff I would never drink, but hey, free is free. I finally make it to their cabin and luckily they have some craft beer left over kep “cold” with river water. I’m glad we met this group of guys, they seem to be the few normal people thru-hiking. Oh, I forgot to mention that you can see the nearby forest fire from the town. I’ve always wanted to see one in person, so now I get to! You can’t see any flames, but there is a good amount of smoke. Apparently about 2,500 acres have already burned and they are intentionally burning 4,500 to stop it from spreading.

This hotel (Creekside Court) is a vast improvement from the Alpine Court Motel. Our bed is smaller, but the room overall feels more homey. While waiting for our room to be ready, we did our laundry at the laundromat and got some ice cream at the Artisan Gallery. They had a bunch of intersting homemade flavors. I wanted to try them all but settled on the Lemon Sorbet, which was nice and refreshing. We ran into Slow Jam at the laundromat, another normal guy whose company we enjoy. IPA was at the outfitter as well as Indy and the guys. After dinner, we called mom and dad while watching the smoke billow from the forest above.

We again took our time hiking today, but still arrived at the pickup point a couple of hours early. That means in a couple hours I will be out of the woods and on my way to see Jenny! Of course it will be good to see my parent’s and sister as well. Since we got here so early, we went back into the woods to hang and dry our rainflies from the downpour last night. It’s easier to dry using trees than bedposts in a hotel, haha. Anyway, it will be nice to have 4 zero days in a row, even if 2 of them involves driving 6 hours.…General thoughts about month #1-        the terrain is never what you expect it to be and much more difficult than it looks.-        we have been very lucky about how little rain we’ve had to deal with, although the first week or 2 was freezing cold at times.-         a lot of the people out here are eccentric weirdos with no common courtesy, personal space, or a mind of their own. So when we find fairly normal down-to-earth people (usually old guys, girls, or our one group of friends), then it’s good to maintain a good relationship with them.-        Shelters, hostels, Standing Bear Farm and the like are “must-see” stops for thru-hikers who have little to no original thought. These are just places for the hipster backpacker to be cramped, uncomfortable, dirty, and spend unnecessary extra money because it’s all part of the “true thru-hiker experience”. often times the AT planners will take you near a summit, but not over it.So when you do get a summit with a view, take that extra second to truly enjoy it. The same goes for side trails to a summit or view. Go ahead and walk an extra ½ mile or so, if there’s a trail, it’s usually worth it to take.-        the wild outdoors are once in a lifetime beauty to witness and no amount of pictures or poetry can capture the true essence of theis lively wilderness. Take some time and some risks to experience it firsthand. You will not be disappointed. -        Hammocking is way better than tenting. It’s more comfortable, you and your stuff stays dryer, you have more options on where to camp and you have a seat off the ground when ever you want it. -        my body took some major beatings at first, but after fighting through the pain, I am stronger for it.-        Changing socks ofter and using toe sock liners are a must!-        My clothes and myself always have a foul odor to them, no matter how many times each of them are washed.","Jerry Cabin Shelter

I remember arriving in Cincy last Friday and how weird it felt to be back there. Not to mention how loud the city felt after being in the woods for a month. Now being out here for a day it seems a bit strange, yet feels familiar imultaneously. When I walked away from Devil Fork Gap, it felt like I was going on a simple hike in the woods back home and I’d be back doing modern civilization activities at night. It’s like my mind is trying to live in 2 worlds simultaneously but can’t decide where it wants to be. I guess I had similar feelings the first couple days after Springer and I got used to it. I guess I didn’t figure a small 4 day break would put me back into city mode so easily. Anyway, I’m out here now on a clear night listening to crickets and tree frogs singing in their high pitched octave. It occurs to me now that this is the first night I’ve heard them. I’m sure they’ve been out before, I just must not have taken note.  The morning started off rainy so when we got to our drop off point, we three (Danny, Mom, and I) played clubs in the car waiting for it to dry up. When it did, Mom made us a salami sandwich and we went on our way. Again, I’d like to thank my parents for their support and understanding when it comes to the couple of breaks from the trail. One last thing, tonight Ziploc and I switched thermal systems for our hammocks because I was curious how well his pad worked. If it keeps my back warmer, I may buy one and use it with the top part of my supershelter. I want to keep the top because it helps cut down on wind tremendously.","Devil Fork Gap

It was neat to walk through as the sound was lighter than rain as each bee-bee sized piece bounced off the leaves. The temperature hovered between 42 – 45 degrees which with the precipitation and wind easily dipped below freezing. Both Ziploc and I were shivering after our short lunch break 2 hours after starting our hike. Which reminds me, my appetite is definitely off the charts when I’m hiking.

Overall, it was a short day for us, but not too bad of a pace and mileage. We thought about pushing on another 4 miles past the heavily spruced steep Unaka Mountain, but with a chance of snow tonight, we decided to save it for tomorrow. Speaking of snow, it’s a good thing we stayed in town last night because it snowed up in the mountains we traversed today. We have been extremely lucky so far avoiding rain and snow simply by zeroing or neroing into a town before hell is unleashed on weary travelers. We often missed it by just a few hours or only had to endure it minimally before warming up in a hotel room. Beauty Spot Gap includes a grassy bald where we would’ve loved to cowboy camp had it not been so cold and windy. Today it’s around 50 degrees, but the windchill cuts it close to freezing. There were great views of the surrounding mountains and foothills from up there. Seeing all those relatively flat foothills so close to where we are hiking is kind of a bittersweet moment. On one had, you wish the trail planners would take you over them instead of those big mountains. On the other hand, part of thru-hiking is the challenge of it all; if the whole trail were low rolling hills not mountains, then the accomplishment of finishing would be diminished.Today is the first day since the 4 day break that I’ve felt like I’m on the trail again. The previous few days have felt like a weekend trip sandwiched by living in the city. But today, not only was I more mentally prepared for it, but physically as well. I was much less tired on the long uphills and my vision of where to place my foot for every step was quicker and more efficient. Hopefully this will translate into larger days for us. That of course will also depend on if we get out of our hammocks before 8, which with the impending cold night, seems unlikely.","Erwin, TN

Eventually the night will get warmer, allowing us to wake when we plan to, but until then we’ll just keep setting overly ambitious goals for ourselves. Our decision to end the day early yesterday was a wise one however because the big mountain we considered crossing got hit with some snow! At camp, I saw the storm cloud engulfing the mountain about the time we would’ve been summiting it. So that was definitely a good call, but it was cool to see snow for the first time on the trail. As we were walking down the other side, I couldn’t help myself and grabbed a handful and turned around to throw it at Ziploc. He of course paid me back. the summit of that mountain was a very neat looking place with lots of spruce trees. The dead needles were very nice on the knees. After that climb, it was a fairly easy day where we went 3-1/2 to 4 mph at times. allowing us to get the distance we did in the time we did. I’m currently in my hammock listening to the wind and rain hit my rainfly. It started raining about 20 minutes after we chose our camp spot, so again, pretty lucky to avoid it. Right before getting into my hammock, while eating dinner, I noticed a light off in the distance. I told Ziploc and we both shut off our headlamps to watch. We both could have sworn that they were movign closer toward us. While watching the light, I noticed a second one which turned out to be the one Ziploc was watching. We thought it was either night hikers or coyote hunters, either way they made us cautiously uncomfortable. After watching them dance around for 15 – 20 minutes, we saw a couple more in the surrounding hills and determined they were house lights flickering through nearby leaves blowing in the wind. Our paranoid minds definitely got the best of us there! Well if it’s not raining, we’ll try to leave before 10… we’ll see about that!Oh, I almost forgot, we got some trail magic from a cooler in the form of Oreos, Samoas, and Coke! We also saw this moron hiker with an acoustic guitar. What a hassle that must be. He did have hikers sign their names on it, which was cool, but I think Pebble’s white jacket is a better way to go for that.

Somehow my rainfly was dry but Ziploc’s wasn’t, which has been trend of late strangely enough. Our big climb today was Roan Mountain, a 6,000 foot behemoth full of stairs that had us gasping for air halfway up. We only stopped a couple of times for a quick breather, which is far better than how we were doing in Georgia. Something interesting I’ve noticed is that for the past few days we’ve been passing people on the trail that we passed weeks ago. It’s amazing how a 4 day break can put you in a bubble of people you thought you’d never see again. We’ll definitely see all new people after our 2 week break, or none at all which would be strange. After Roan and walking through a cloud at the summit, we continued to a series of balds that were littered with families going on a stroll for Mother’s Day. There would’ve been nice views during this walk had it not been for the cloud cover we were in. Oh well, I doubt those views would’ve beat Max Patch anyway. I’m not sure anything will. This evening at camp was hilarious as I got to see Danny struggle to subtract simple numbers to figure out mileage. I had to teach him how to reduce the number on the left to add 1 to the front of the number on the right. He was trying to put a zero to the right of the right number HAHAHA. Our brains definitely do shut down at times out here.Oh, I almost forgot the most exciting thing that happened today. Near the end of our hike, I spotted an owl fly from tree to tree near the trail. I tell Ziploc so we continue quietly with my camera recording. I see it again on the branch and it’s looking directly at me before taking off again. This time captured on film! The owl does this a couple more times, but then I see it swoop down, land on the ground, seemingly struggling with something, then take off to another tree with prey in it’s talons! We walk to where I thought it landed and begin looking up for it. It isn’t until the owl eats its prey and the remaining leaves from its kill land on our heads that I realize it’s directly above us about 20 feet up in the tree! The owl’s wide dark eyes are staring directly into mine as I’m sure it’s studying what my intentions are. The gaze of a large owl is fairly intimidating – gets my survival instincts on edge. Nonetheless, I take the best picture I can of it before it flies off, never to be seen again. It’s amazing how such a large bird, the size of a basketball, can fly with such silence. I would have never known it was there if I didn’t look up at that exact moment, but I’m glad I did!Well, nature keeps putting on a show for me. In the twilight hours this morning, I woke up at 3 AM to the sound of a pack of coyotes yelping over their last victim. I estimate they were no further than ¼ mile away. When that sound woke me, my half asleep self thought, “Oh, I must be back in Marietta” since I can usually hear them from my bedroom there. As soon as I realized I was actually in the wilderness, I grabbed my knife and made it a little more accessible, just in case. Then, around 6 AM, I was awakened again to the sounds of two deer snorting as if they detected a threat. One was maybe 100 yards away to my right and the other a bit further on my left. The sound they make is a bit intimidating as well, so it’s a good thing I knew what it was as to not cause any alarm. Nature is finally coming to life!","Hughes Gap

The dirt trail through a grassy hillside reminded me of Scotland, or at least pictures I’ve seen of Scotland. If there were sheep openly grazing on the sides it would not have surprised me. It was one of the coolest walks we’ve had simply because we could see the whole trail from the bottom. We were rewarded with a 360 degree view near the Stan Murray plaque and the grassy ridgeline continued to offer us view on our descent. About 6 miles into our hike, we crossed the TN/NC border for the last time! Sayonara North Carolina! It was definitely a tough state so I’m glad to have it behind us. Now a bit less than 70 miles until we can wave bon voyage to our third state! That will be a nice relief. We stopped at Mountain Harbour Hostel for lunch and a small resupply before hitting the trail again. We got mainly snack foods and pop to eat, but some guy came with an SUV full of food to restock the store. So of course I had to get a BBQ Rib sandwich even though I’d already eaten what I was planning on. It was definitely the right decision to make. With everything I ate there, I actually am not hungry enough for a Mountain House tonight! That’s the first time that’s happened to me, but only 4 miles after the hostel wasn’t enough to bring the extreme hunger back. I’m sure I’ll regret not eating it later tonight, but I’m eating enough snacks tonight to get me through. We had an interesting sequence of photos near the end of our hike. First, I took a pic of a cemetery, then Ziploc found a deer skeleton that he pretended to eat (kind of looks human), then we filled water at a church.

Neither of us care too much about it, but it’ll still be cool to have that experience. For the last 2 miles of our day, we were hiking through a burned forest. We believe it was a controlled burn, but it was still neat to witness firsthand. The smell of charred wood lingered in the air as it the fire were from last night. There’s no telling how long we’ll be walking through it as I can see it on the trail ahead. We are camping in the only green patch untouched by flame; a meadow with a watchful turkey grazing nearby. We also got to see a pretty big waterfall about 2 miles into our day.Some interesting commentary on life on the AT.

First came Laurel Falls which was the largest and coolest waterfall we’ve come across yet. Right after that, the trail traversed a rock ledge along the roaring river. Since all the rocks were wet, it was slightly more dangerous, but it would’ve only been a 5 feet fall into the river. This combined with the mile or so beforehand, we were walking between large cuts through white stone a hundred feet above the river. A pretty neat walk, but difficult at times. Soon after the falls we came to a huge mountain that was 2.5 miles up and 3 miles down to get to the road crossing into town. We got a taxi into Elizabethton instead of Hampton since there were no hotels there, only hostels. In fact, this Americourt Inn is the only hotel in 3 towns. Apparently it’s either a hostel or B & B when we get to Damascus for Trail Days on Saturday. That is, if there’s any rooms left anywhere. At some point, we came across a sign informing hikers that the wildfire was contained and included a bunch of technical info about it. So I guess the 3-4 miles we walked through wasn’t a controlled burn and was only the corner of the affected area.","Meadow at Piped Spring

RADAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533986,"Well, today started off fairly eventful. We were ready to head back to the trail, so we called the taxi service and they said it was over an hour until they could get us. So we go outside to figure out something to do in that time, when a lady in a van offers us a warm hello. She seemed like someone who was waiting to pick up hikers, so I said a bit loudly to Ziploc, “We could try to hitch”, hoping she’d overhear. She did and offered us a ride to the trailhead before taking her scheduled pickup to Damascus. On the way, she pulled over to pick up another hiker trying to hitch. As soon as she did, a cop pulls behind us with lights on. We thought that maybe hitching was illegal here and he was going to bust the other guy. Our driver thought it was because she was speeding, which it turns out it was. The cop seemed friendly and took her license to check some stuff out. After 5 minutes or so he comes back and says “I see you have a couple other violations already. Since you’re doing a nice thing for these hikers and I don’t feel like writing a ticket today, I’m going to let you go with a warning. We all thanked him, the other hiker got in, and we went to the trailhead. When we got there, I asked how much we owed her and she said nothing, she was just killing time. So not only did we not have to wait an hour for a ride, but we didn’t have to pay for one! Good karma was on our side that time.After getting on the trail, we walked alongside Watauga Lake for 3 miles before coming to Watauga Dam. It’s an earthen dam much different from Fontana Dam with a sole purpose of allowing this man made lake to exist. We then continued up some fairly steep hills before coming to a ridgeline that again went alongside Watauga Lake, this time 2,000 fee higher. I don’t know how far the lake stretches, but we’ve been able to see it during our whole hike today. I wanted to get 15 miles today so we could attempt a 25 mile day tomorrow to get to Damascus Friday night. Unfortunately a storm began to roll through around our 12 mile mark, so we cut our losses and found the 1st good spot to set up camp before we got too wet. About 10 minutes after setting up our rainflies, the rain was done and the sun was attempting to come out. So we could have continued to get my 15 mile goal, but you just never know about this mountain weather.","Hampton, TN

RADAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533987,"Friday the 13th is usually a lucky day for me and this one continues that trend. We walked our farthest day yet today! The terrain the past couple of days has been relatively easy, allowing us to average over 3 mph except for our stops. Today was one of the muddiest days so far as most of the first 11 miles was 4” deep mud, creating some fun slip-n-slide moments…most of which were unintentional.   Neither of us fell, but Ziploc came close on multiple occasions. We walked through a cow pasture that offered us stunning views of Shady Valley below. There were around 20 cows and at least one bull right next to the trail. They didn’t seem to mind that all these people were walking through. The gates on both ends of the field area had a very interesting but ingenious latching system that we felt deserved a video showing how it worked. After all the rain we got last night, it was nice to have a hiking day without it. Now we’re only 8 miles from Damascus where we’ll spend a few hours enjoying Trail Days, but then it’s back on the trail for us!","spring at campsite

RADAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533988,"We tried to wake up early today, but the cold, windy morning kept us cocooned in our sleeping bags. Eventually I forced myself to get up and pack quickly so we could hike our 8 miles to Damascus before noon. Leaving when we did was perfect because we got into town at 11:45, 15 minutes before my arbitrary goal! About 3.5 miles before this however, we crossed the TN/VA border, meaning we’re done with our 3rd state! Tennessee was definitely a tough state and it gave us some difficult days. However, since Watauga Lake, the terrain was relatively easy compared to the rest of the state. It’s almost as if Tennessee was tipping his hat for besting him in a game of endurance. He put us through the ringer and as a reward, let us pass his northern boundary without a fight. Tennessee, it was fun while it lasted, but I’m glad to be done with you.Now to completely change subjects, I want to write about something possibly disgusting, but definitely interesting. Since I have started hiking the AT, I have a more difficult time pooping n civilization using a real toilet, but I’ve had no trouble going in the woods. In fact, if I feel like I have to go the morning we leave our hotel, nothing will come of it. But as soon as I’m back on the trail, not more than ½ mile in, my body will decide it’s time to…open the floodgates. It’s almost like I have reverted to a primordial state of existence where I’m only comfortable doing my business in nature. I only bring this up because I needed to go as we were walking to Damascus, so I was going to try to hold it for town. Then I realized that I probably won’t be able to go once there, which will hinder my ability to eat massive amounts of food. So, I decide to go on the TN/VA border. Now I have officially pooped in 2 states at the same time! Next up I guess is the 4 corners.Okay, now back to normal things. In Damascus, after going to the library for some general info, we walk through the area with all the vendors so I can check out some tents that would work for Jenny and I. After checking a couple out, we spot the Hennessy Hammock tent. I figure since my hammock ridgeline is fraying, maybe they can do a repair. Well, Tom Hennessy, the founder and CEO, is there himself. I told him my problem and he asked me to show him He sat down in his chair, looked it over quickly, and began fixing it. Within 5 minutes, my hammock was fixed! And not by some random guy, but by Tom himself, free of charge! After fixing my hammock, he showed me a new, better way to hang it using one descending ring on each side instead of two. I am currently in my hammock using this new system and it works great. Oh, by the way, for Hennessy the company to fix it, it would’ve cost $15 for the repair and $20 shipping each way. They also could only do a 2 week shipping back to me. So I saved $50 and 3 – 4 weeks without my hammock by being at Trail Days today. Thanks Tom Hennessy!After this nice turn of events, we go to an all-you-can-eat pizza buffet for $7. This was a great find as I ate my weight in pizza with salad and pudding as dessert. We then went next door to Food City for our 5 day resupply and I only spent $17! I don’t know how I managed it so cheap. We then checked out a few outfitters on our way out of town. I bought Outdoor Research Sparkplug gaiters. Ever since I bought bigger shoes, I have been getting more and more stuff in my shoes while hiking. The Sparkplugs are super light weight and seem like they’ll do the trick. We then charged our phones at Subway while I spoke to Jenny for a bit. It is always nice when I get to hear her voice, even just for a few minutes. I then got an ice cream cone for the road and headed back into the woods.About 4 miles in, we had to detour on another trail as a footbridge crossing a large stream had been washed out. We walked the detour and reconnected with the AT before stopping to camp. All in all, this was a very eventful day. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that we ran into Indy, Pyro, Stretch, and Badger in Damascus. Somehow they are only 11 miles north of there on the trail. So as we sit here at camp, we’re only 6 miles behind them. I di the math since our break and concluded that they’re averaging only 10.8 miles per day since we saw them last before our break. Since being back, we’re only averaging 13.9 miles per day and have somehow basically caught them! It’s funny how that works out sometimes.PS – I’m going to refer to those 4 guys as the Lost Boys, it’s easier to write.","1.8 miles past Abingdon Gap Shelter

RADAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533989,"I actually woke up before 8 today, but we still left late due to a very cold morning. The temperature all day didn’t get higher than 50 degrees. The hiking all day was mostly uphill, but we still kept a 2 mph overall pace. Not bad! It all culminated with a final climb 5,000 feet up to Buzzard Rock. It’s a long 4 mile climb over white rock and grassy fields to get to the majestic view that awaits. On y way up I saw a garter snake, the biggest I’ve ever seen, in strike position on the edge of the trail. It’s neck reared back as if ready to fight, I backed away about a foot. It then slowly turned it’s head the opposite direction and slowly meandered into the tall grass at the base of a large rock. This snake wasn’t scared one bit about my presence. I was really tempted to pickup a large rock and smash it’s head, but I resisted the urge and went on my way. When I reached the top, there was steady, cold wind with about 40 to 50 mph gusts. It was freezing! Since I had to wait there for Ziploc to get done doing his business, I threw on my down jacket, rain jacket, and Baclava to stay warm. I sat down on a large rock overlooking the valley and enjoyed the alone time that I was granted. Once Ziploc came up, we continued another 3 miles to camp. There are about 13 tents and 3 hammocks (including our own) set up in this campground by a highway. Way more than we expected! We got some trail magic from Reptar and Fancy Pants. Unfortunately they are with friends who brought food and they will probably be loud late into the night. It’s 10 PM and they’re still going strong. Jerks.","Between 2 Streams

RADAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533991,"Today was a very eventful day that included the highest peak in Virginia, very tough hiking, the 500th mile, a foot bridge collapsing on me, a Lost Boys sighting and our longest day so far. Oh, and wild ponies and trail maintainers.
Let’s begin… About 4 mile in, we took a ½ mile side trail to get to the summit of Mt. Rogers, Virginia’s highest peak. The top consisted of a thick spruce tree forest, so we were bummed we didn’t have a view. But we still had fun finding the survey markers that marked the high point. The first 15 miles were the toughest miles since our second week in GA. Large boulders, jagged rocks, bit steps and thick roots were the story during those miles. Not only did it slow down our pace, but it killed our feet. Mine were in pain after 6 miles. Normally I can go 12 these days before the pain comes. Through all the bumps and bruises, however, we crossed the 500 mile mark. It’s not quite ¼ of the trail, but it’s still an accomplishment! About 3 miles later, some shoddy craftsmanship could have ended my hike early. I was crossing a fast moving stream on a typical footbridge, keeping a good pace. I look ahead to the other side and see a wooden ramp going down. I think “Well that’s nice they put in a ramp instead of huge stairs”. I get to it and step on, not thinking anything is awry. Well, as soon as any weight lands on it , the ramp collapses and slams to the ground. My full weight and momentum is still going forward so I throw my poles in front of me to stop my fall. The right pole slips on a wet rock, so I instinctively toss it aside to use my hands. Meanwhile, my left foot is at bridge height trying to figure out what’s going on while my right foot is trying to regain balance. My right knee then bangs into the failed ramp and my left arm scraps on a rock. I eventually settle in one place, face down on top of the ramp next to the creek. I tell Ziploc I’m okay and get up to look at the terrible design. Their main flaw in the ramp was that they forgot to put an anchor on the ground to hold the ramp in place. The lack of one caused the ramp to move laterally when I stepped on it. An oversight of lack of design could have sent me home had my injuries have been worse. I put the ramp back up since it’s a 3 foot drop without it. I hope nobody else has the same problem I did. 
A couple miles later, we see our first AT maintenance crew at Scales Livestock Corral finishing for the day. There were probably 50 people there with enough sledgehammers and pick axes to supply a small army. There were about 30 poles up in the truck with double that many piled up by the trail it was a HUGE operation! They were there putting in stairs on the hillside we just came down. It was annoying to see what they were doing to the trail. One cool thing though was when the guy in the back saw we were close, he yelled “Hikers coming through”! and the whole line of 6 or so guys stepped off the side to let us pass. At least they respect us enough to get over out of our way! About 5 miles later at Fox Creek we passed the Lost Boys! It was actually just Indy and Badger as they were waiting for Pyro and Stretch was ahead of them. It’s crazy to think that after a 5 day break, we were able to catch up and pass the Lost Boys. But it makes sense since it seems their pace and mileage has severely decreased as ours has increased significantly. We may see them again in Marion, VA during our zero day, but if not, then we may actually never see them again. Throughout the whole day, we were seeing wild ponies everywhere! It started with a group of them about a mile before Mt. Rogers that I recorded as we passed. We thought that’s all we would see, but there were 7 different herds! I counted a total of 33 full grown ponies, 7 younger ones and one baby pony. That doesn’t include the 25 – 30 ponies from the last two herds that were too far away to count. It was a very cool surprise to walk next to those ponies for miles! Indy said they wandered into their camp last night and one fell asleep on his lap for a bit. All of this happened during our longest hiking day to date. It’s hard to believe there can be this much variety and action just by hiking a simple 20 miles through the woods, but here we are. I’m glad the hike is staying fresh and hasn’t become stale and boring. If it ever does, it would be that much harder to continue.","Elk Garden

We then came across a small waterfall, bringing our total to about 7 falls for the hike. It’s pretty cool the trail takes us near so many of them, it’s always a treat to randomly come across. The whole day, I was walking in a daze, partly due to bad weather, partly because I was trying not to think about my hurting feet and partly because I was thinking about the food I’d eat in Marion. So we made it our 18 miles at a decent time and got a taxi into town. We are zeroing here tomorrow, so it’s a much more relaxed visit than normal. We’re at the Econolodge both nights.

RADAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534923,"We caught the 11 o’clock shuttle from town, which costs only 50 cents to ride since it’s government run. The terrain today was mostly flat with a lot of rocks in the beginning. We stopped 7 miles in at a shelter to eat lunch. About 3 miles after that, there was an old school built in 1894 that is now part of the Settlers Museum of Southwest Virginia. Inside this school were boxes and coolers stuffed with food, snacks, drinks, toiletries, etc. Pretty much anything a hiker would need could be found in the neat bit of trail magic. It was placed there and stocked by West End United Methodist Church. So I got to enjoy eating some of this stuff while sitting at a school desk built 120 years ago! That was pretty cool if you ask me. While there, another hiker named Wheels came in and told us about a 16 oz burger a few miles up called the hiker burger. Although Ziploc and I just ate lunch and trail magic, we decided to eat there as well when we got there. So we grabbed a good helping of snacks and went up to the old farm building that’s part of the museum as well. We just looked at the outside then went on our way. A few miles later on, again, very flat terrain, we came to the Barn Restaurant where they had the 1 pound hiker burger. Ziploc and I each ordered one and a side of fries to share. I don’t remember if this is the biggest burger I’ve ever had or not, but it’s at least top 2. Much to my surprise, I was able to finish by burger and half the fries with no problem. I even considered getting a slice of hot fudge cake for dessert, but thought better of it. We didn’t leave the restaurant, which is right next to I-81 by the way, until 6 p.m. Our goal was to get another 4 miles about, which is why we got to camp so late. This wasn’t a big deal since we didn’t have to cook tonight. Oh yeah, there was a hiker box full of trail magic at the restaurant so we grabbed some extra meals and snacks from there as well. With both of these trail magics today, we could’ve gotten away without resupplying in Marion! Oh well, there was no way to know that. After the burger, we walked through a cow pasture and these cows seemed extra annoyed that we were there. Usually the cattle we encounter while hiking don’t care about us, but these were all staring at us and snorting. Thinking about it now, maybe we smelled like beef from our huge burger and they weren’t happy about it. I guess those cows are the Chik-fil-a “Eat Mor Chikin” cows. After making it through that gauntlet of dirty stares, we walked another 2 miles to our camp for the night. One cool thing about where we’re camping today is it’s at Mile Marker 547, which is almost exactly ¼ of the trail ! To be honest, I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to make it this far, let alone both of us being here in relative good health.

I still have half a jar of hazelnut chocolate spread left, but the isn’t a bad thing. Today was filled with ups and downs that slowed our pace, unlike the relatively easy terrain yesterday. About 5 miles into our hike, we came across a wooden sign marking the ¼ mark at Mile Marker 547. We were confused since AWOL’s Guide said this was 5 miles earlier. One of them is wrong, but it doesn’t really matter anyway as long as we finish on top of Katahdin. There will be no question how far we hiked then. We hiked through a pleasant stretch of cow pastures that offered nice views of the surrounding mountains. One farm we passed had probably 70% of their cattle were calves. It was strange to see that ratio flipped like that. We stopped early today because it was sprinkling and we didn’t want to get caught in the rain on the big mountain coming up.

It’s been hard to get motivated to get out of bed these past few nights for some reason. The terrain today was extremely difficult to a point that slowed our pace significantly. There were either large boulders or slippery mud that we had to traverse up and down steep hills. We were given a couple nice views of the valley below at times, but most of the day was spent in the trees. One good thing about today is the fact that I’ve now gone 2 ½ days without knee braces! I hadn’t taken any pain pills since the 4 day break. After lunch 2 days ago, I forgot to put my braces on until camp, so I figured I’d keep doing it to try and strengthen my knees. My right knee has performed admirably while my left has some minor aches and uncomfortableness that I’m sure the braces help with. However, it hasn’t been enough to warrant putting them back on. Well, it’s 8 pm and the rain has started which will make tomorrow’s hike a soggy one again.

But I’m not going to lie, I really enjoyed the downhills in those conditions. I would intentionally slide a coupe feet with each step, treating the mud as a fresh layer of snow on a ski slope. Using the poles in a similar manner I would while skiing helped complete the illusion. Overall, it was a relatively quick hiking day despite the conditions. We arrived at the crossroads near I-77 to go into Bland, VA at a decent hour. Our original plan a couple days ago was just make a quick pit stop at DQ for ice cream, then hit the trail for a few more miles.

Yesterday, Indy’s parents said they would take us to the trail in the morning, but their car was gone when we looked out. We knew they were staying another night, so we figured they’d gone to breakfast and would be back shortly. After a little bit, we called the shuttle service that brought us to the hotel, but he was busy for a couple hours. So we just sat around watching a 2 – hour “to be continued” series of King of Queens. After that waste of time, we finally left the hotel and went to DQ for lunch. We didn’t have service so we decided to just walk the 4 miles to the trailhead, hopefully getting a hitch along the way. After about 5 minutes of walking, I checked my phone again and we had service. So we called the shuttle and he said he’d come by in 20 minutes, so we waited at the Dollar General. He arrived on time and took us to the trail for $10. Our hike started with a mile road walk before a very steep, long ascent into the woods. The whole day was one of the most PUDy [Pointless Ups and Downs] days we’ve had so far. We made great time getting to the shelter 12 miles away before 5 pm. MY only complaint was the amount of spider webs I encountered all day. Normally they don’t bother me too much, but today I felt like I was walking through Shelob’s Lair without Sting. It was driving me bonkers so maybe I’ll let Ziploc walk ahead of me tomorrow. Anyway, after the shelter water refill, we continued to have a good pace up the next big hill. But as soon as we got up there, El Nino decided to pay us a little visit. The rain started coming down in sheets just as we got to a rocky stretch of terrain…not a fun combination. Needless to say, this slowed our pace quite a bit. Luckily it didn’t last too long and as soon as we started our 2 mile descent, the rain let up. The ground was muddy of course, but this was the slipperiest mud I have ever encountered. I tried to stand still and slid a couple of feet without trying. At one point, I did an uncontrolled 180 and another time a full squat. Somehow without any control of my feet or leg muscles, I didn’t fall. If I was a kid living nearby, I’d love to go to that hill and slide down over and over again. Heck, I’d do it now as long as I had a shower afterward. We eventually made it to camp near this pretty cool suspension bridge crossing Kimberling Creek, relatively dry and clean. It’s beginning to rain again as I lay here in my hammock, so it was good that it held off until now.-        Something I forgot to mention is that Indy and his parents randomly showed up at the trailhead where it cuts into the woods just as we were about to enter. They happened to drive down some nearly abandoned road just as we got there; Indy shows up in the places I least expect to see him at times that almost work out too well.

RADAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535231,"The first 9 miles of hiking today was probably the easiest on the trail from what I remember. At least, the easiest long stretch of trail. It was what we call “hiker flat” or “AT flat”, where there may be a slight up or down at all times, but to us it’s not even noticeable. There was almost constant mud again, but most of it could be avoided. Two miles into the hike, we came to the side trail for Dismal Falls. Ziploc wasn’t sure he wanted to hike the 0.3 miles to it because the name made it sound like a bad one… or dismal one. I did want to go thinking the name was ironic. Boy was I right! I rank this waterfall as #2 so far behind Laurel Falls in terms of just viewing from a distance. However I rand Dismal Falls as #1 for most fun to visit. On the top there are multiple places to climb, wade in or sit in the fast moving rapids for a quick thrill. At the bottom of the falls is a swimming hole big enough for 30 people and deep enough to jump into from the nearby climbing rocks. Not to mention the great view of the falls at all times. There is joy to be had for people of all ages at Dismal Falls. After our 9 miles of fairly easy hiking, we came to a steep 2 mile uphill. I was sweating bullets as the temperature made it into the mid 70’s. I finally made it to the top where I was going t stop for water when I heard some leaves rustling ahead of me. I figured it was just another hiker taking a break but looked up anyway. The noise turned out to be 2 black bear cubs !! They were about 40 yards away when they noticed me and took off running over the nearby ridge. The larger cub was closely behind the smaller one, possibly protecting it as they ran for cover. I paused where I was standing and did a quick scan of my surroundings to make sure momma bear wasn’t nearby. She wasn’t anywhere to be seen, so I just waited there for Ziploc to catch up. When he did, I told him where they ran so I started taking video as we walked over the ridge together, hoping for another viewing. We were not so lucky this time, but I may have spotted a cave, their possible home, from a distance. But we didn’t explore further and just went on our way down the trail My top goal behind finishing the AT was to come across a black bear.

RADAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535232,"We got one of our earliest starts today, on a day we know we were only going 8 ½ miles. I guess we were motivated by the fact that we were about to start our two week break. That, or possibly knowing there was a pizza buffet and Dairy Queen waiting for us in town. The entire day was rocky again with a long 3 mile uphill and 3 mile downhill to bookend our hiking today. We were rewarded with a few pretty nice views on the ridge. It was interesting to see the difference in profile between these mountains and the ones in GA/NC/TN. In those 3 states, there were multiple defined peaks in one mountain range, whereas here in Virginia, it seems to be one very wide mountain. You would think this would mean easier hiking once up on the ridge. If it were simple dirt paths it would be, but VA is probably the rockiest state yet, thus increasing the difficulty to that of the previous states. From these views, it was also interesting how there seemed to be just 3 or 4 layers of large mountains as opposed to 12 plus in GA/NC/TN. What I mean by this is that there are less majestic peaks in Virginia rising into the horizon and more foothills and flatlands. Once we arrived at the road crossing after the steep downhill, we walked about a mile into town where we were meeting mom. Oh, first we ran into an older gentleman and his son, probably 70 years old and 45 years old, on the way down. They where asking where the next water was. Unfortunately for them, it wasn’t for 6 miles or so. Fortunately for them, we were almost done hiking and gave them whatever we had left. Their names were Ted E. Bear and Wooly Bully. I’m glad we were able to help them out. Okay, now back to Pearisburg. We were almost to the Pizza Plus when mom pulled up next to us. We just finished walking there while she turned around. We probably couldn’t have planned out when to meet in town more perfectly. Well, we all ate some all-you-can-eat pizza until I was stuffed. Then we treated ourselves to a Blizzard at Dairy Queen. I got a large Oreo per the usual. I’m never too full for ice cream. I am now sitting back home in Marietta, OH at the beginning of my two week break!","Doc's Knob Shelter
