CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516024,"So, a few years ago I was looking around a local outdoor gear store (Bill Jackson's in Pinellas Park, FL) and saw some books and maps about the Appalachian Trail. I said to the friend that was with me at the time that I would love to do that some day - thru-hike the Appalachian Trail.   Fast forward to this year - a year filled with some major life changes and way too much stress. With my entire life changing (again), I decided it was time to take a break - a nice long one (6 months perhaps). I won't (or can't) explain here why I NEED to do this - maybe I don't even understand it all yet - but one thing is for sure, I AM going to do it!!",,View Entry,"Oct 19, Mon",0
CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516063,"I want to let all my family and friends know how truly awesome they are! Even though some of them may not understand why I am doing this, they all have been SUPER supportive!   I couldn't ask for anything more. They have helped me research, train, shop for gear, given me financial and emotional support - they are the best!I also wanted to give a shout out to the Suncoast Chapter of the Florida Trail Association. They are the nicest group of people!   I joined the association because I know practically nothing about backpacking and camping. I have been on numerous hikes with them now and everyone I have talked to about my journey has been so excited for me and more than willing to share any information they have that might help. Thank you! I am really looking forward to my first full pack hike and camping trip!",,View Entry,"Oct 20, Tue",0
CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517684,"Went on my first camping trip this past weekend to try out all of my gear. I am happy to say that even with a little rain everything worked really well!   I got a couple of small hikes in with my pack which now weighs 20 lbs without the water and only 3 days worth of food! I still have a number of small things to get and all my warm weather gear so I am getting seriously worried about the weight. I really don't think I will be able to handle any more than 30 lbs so I am going to have to re-evaluate everything and try to cull it down some.The camping trip was with the Suncoast Chapter of the Florida Trail Association. We were working on maintaining the trail at Little Manatee River State Park (shout out to my painting partner Yarro!). As I stated before, everyone I have met in this group has been super nice and very helpful but I want to give special thanks to the following people that really took the time to share their knowledge about backpacking, camping, and the AT with me: Ralph - thanks for all the great info and for helping me to cook my first meal; Arnold - thanks for all the info too and making sure my tent was set up properly so I didn't get wet when it rained Saturday night; Mike - I am going to be ordering that trail/camp stool and Wes for all your advice.This coming weekend is the big 4 day, 40 mile Thanksgiving weekend trip - wish me luck! I will let you all know how it goes!",,View Entry,"Nov 24, Tue",0
CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521884,"So, over Thanksgiving weekend (Thursday to Sunday), was my first real test. Four days, 40 miles, setting up and tearing down camp every day. It was great! I was with an awesome group of people from the Suncoast Chapter of the Florida Trail Association. I learned SO MUCH! i want to send out a sincere Thank You to everyone on that trip. I truly credit you all for helping me make it! I was trying out my second pair of shoes and they failed miserably - my feet are nothing but blisters but I would not have missed the experience for the world. Now, I just need to find a different pair of shoes..............",,Thanksgiving Trip ,"Nov 30, Mon",0
CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521885,"Oh dear - not good! Here it is January already. I took the whole month of December off from hiking and training (not good). January arrived with a renewed sense of purpose and a realization that I am running out of preparation time!! I did spend December finding new shoes - 3rd pair returned to store and then 2 hours at REI in Jacksonville to find the pair I have now. So, I joined the local YMCA and I went on my first traning hike with the FTA yesterday since the Thanksgiving trip. The bad news is I tripped (quite ungracefully) and I now have a sprained left wrist - not good! I will continue to hike on the weekends and try to use the treadmill at the gym............",,View Entry,"Jan 10, Sun",0
CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521887,"The AT Kick-Off is next weekend at Amicalola Falls and I will be there! I have all my gear. Without food or water, my pack weight is 19 lbs. so I should be around my max goal weight of 30. I am not as physically prepared as I would like to be but I am just going to take it slow in the beginning and not try to push too hard. If I can keep from injuring myself, I should be alright. I am very lucky to have lots of options for my start date (I can wait on a break for good weather) and I don't have to finish by any certain date so I can flip-flop if I need to. My motto will be slow and steady will get me there! I am SO EXCITED - I can't wait to meet other thru-hikers at the Kick-Off! I am ready to start my adventure!",,I am ready!,"Feb 26, Fri",0
CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523175,"The ATKO was great. Lots of good speakers - very informational. Very glad I was able to go. I, however, am not out on the trail where I should be. I injured my lower back somehow on February 29th and no matter what I have tried it is not getting any better. I am staying with my daughter in Atlanta with the hope of starting as soon as I can pick up my pack and put it on. If I am not better by this Monday, I will be trying to find a doctor here to see what is wrong. I will write again as soon as I have better news.",,One more setback,"Mar 11, Fri",0
CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526193,We went to Amicalola Falls today and I registered my thru-hike. I am hiker #1219!We are all set to start on Monday 4/4. I am very excited to report that both my daughter and my granddaughter will be hiking the first three days with me! I couldn't be happier. My back is feeling better. I have been doing small practice hikes with increasing weight but the real test will be those first three days. Wish me luck!,,Ready to go!,"Apr 02, Sat",0
CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526725,Finally started! Faye an Emily are walking with me for the first few days! We got to Springer and hiked up to the terminus to take pictures and then back down to the parking lot and on to the Hawk Mtn. Shelter. Very tough day with my 30 lb pack. 6 hours to hike 7 miles! Great place to sleep though.,"Springer Mountain

CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526764,Got a late start. Very windy last night and Faye and Emily's tent was not good in those conditions. All of us sore and moving slow. We didn't make it very far. Hill picked us all up and we went to dinner and back to Atlanta. Hill will drive me back to Cooper Gap in the morning.,"Hawk Mountain Campsite

CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527181,"Got back to Cooper Gap about 10 a.m. this morning. Made it 8.5 miles to Woody Gap where I got a shuttle to the Wolfpen Gap Country Store/Hostel. My first day hiking by myself. It went really well today but I did not carry my whole pack (I left the tent at Faye's). The trail was still tough but I am feeling good! Met a lot of great people at the hostel, in particular Diane and Roy from Tampa! This was a great Hostel and I would recommend it to everyone.","Cooper Gap

CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527188,"A very nice man drove a group of us back to Woody Gap this morning from the hostel in Suches. Then I slack packed 10.5 miles to Neels Gap. I rented the slack pack from the Wolfpen Gap Country Store for $5.00 and I would do it again if I ever had to hike over Blood Mountain again - Brutal, Brutal descent! I NEVER would have made it down the mountain carrying a 30 lb pack there were HUGE boulders that had to be climbed over. On a positive note I did see 3 deer this morning crossing the trail about 100 feet behind me. See if you can find the deer in the picture above. Staying at the Blood Mountain Cabins tonight (very nice). Roy came up and stopped in Atlanta to pick up resupply stuff I had left at Faye's and then picked up my big pack from the hostel.Note: Slack packing is where you just carry a small pack with whatever you need for the day and you leave your full pack at the hostel. For an extra $10, the hostel will deliver your pack to Neels Gap. Highly recommended for this particular section.","Woody Gap

CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527193,"I went to the Mountain Crossings store in Neels Gap this morning and bought a slack pack (I had to return the other one to the Wolfpen Gap Country Store) so that I could hike for the next couple of days without my big pack. Roy picked me up at Hogpen Gap and we went back to stay at the Blood Mountain Cabins. Another day with tough terrain but really AWESOME views. Actually had a little snow/ice falling at the top of one of the mountains this morning. I am slowly learning the trail names of the hikers I have been seeing every day: Trek, Big O, Sea Goat","Neels Gap

CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528330,"Slack packed again today from Hogpen Gap to Unicoi Gap 12.3 miles. Almost didn't make it before dark. Going down that last mountain was really tough! Roy met me at the top and helped me down. We drove to Helen, GA for the night. Cutest little Bavarian town - we had dinner in a great German restaurant overlooking the river. My left knee is really bothering me.","Hogpen Gap
",Unicoi Gap,"Apr 09, Sat",12.30
CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527625,Took a zero day today. I was pretty sore from yesterday - probably pushed it a little too much. Stayed in bed most of the day but did take a walk down the Main Street to see all the cute shops. I also checked on a shuttle to get back to Hogpen tomorrow.,"Hogpen Gap

CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527626,First day with full pack on since last Monday. Only made 5.7 miles to Tray Mountain Shelter. Couldn't get a ride from Helen until 10:00 a.m. Took me 6 hours! It's going to rain tonight so this will be the first real test of my tent.P.S. The tent worked perfect through the rain and intense wind!,"Helen, Georgia
",Tray Mountain Shelter,"Apr 11, Mon",5.70
CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527946,Full pack from Tray Mountain Shelter to Deep Gap Shelter - 7.4 miles. Most of it was nice and easy except for the 800 ft. straight up in 1 mile! Going to try out sleeping in the shelter for the first time. I am considering ditching the tent to lighten the load. Results: I was so scared of the rats and. bugs that I spent the night entirely covered in my sleeping bag. And my left hip was just killing me so I spent the whole night turning over ever half hour which made me feel bad for everyone else in the shelter (the sleeping bag on the air mattress makes a lot of noise). Guess I had better keep the tent!,"Tray Mountain Shelter
",Deep Gap Shelter,"Apr 12, Tue",7.40
CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527950,"Hiked from Deep Gap to Dicks Creek Gap - only 3.6 miles. My back was really bothering me in the morning. I am really struggling with this full pack. Today there was trail magic and trail angels for me! I met a very nice man passing me early in the day (he was going to meet his wife at Dicks Creek for resupply and today was their 31st wedding anniversary) and he could see that I was really struggling and offered to carry some of my pack for me since we were going to the same place. I declined the offer but a couple of hours later another man came walking toward me and said that he had heard about me from the anniversary man so he had come to carry my whole pack for me!! There are some really awesome people out here. Faye met me at Dicks and drove me to Hiawassee. We had lunch, bought a few items, she did my laundry and helped me go through my pack to try to lighten and rearrange it. She did great! I am so lucky to have her close and supporting me!","Deep Gap Shelter

CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528325,"I woke up this morning very discouraged. My pack is better but still heavy. I go so very slow out there. It seems like everyone passing me are like ghosts - we exchange pleasantries and then they are gone. Sometimes I will see them again at the shelter but usually I never see them again. I am worried that soon I will be at the back and there will be no one else to pass me. I will be alone at the shelters. I do want to at least make it through GA. Then maybe I will jump forward some. So, I got a shuttle back to Dick's Creek Gap about 11:30 and hiked 4.5 miles in 4 hours to Plumorchard Gap Shelter. Tomorrow I should cross in to North Carolina!","Dicks Creek Gap

CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528333,Hiked 7.3 miles today to Muskrat Creek Shelter. Crossed in to North Carolina today! Wonderful trail leaving Georgia but North Carolina hit hard from the beginning and was pretty tough. Bad news is my cell phone and my charger are both dead!I need to figure out how to eat correctly. I am only putting in 600 - 800 calories a day and expending thousands. I am sluggish and shaky early in the day which is why I am struggling so much! I need to add more calories without adding much more weight to my pack.,"Plumorchard Gap Shelter
",Muskrat Creek Shelter,"Apr 15, Fri",7.30
CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528337,"Another short day - only 4 miles to Deep Gap. The first 2 miles were very nice but the last 2 was rough terrain (big boulders both going up and down). I arranged a pickup through Haven Budget Inn in Franklin, NC. Expensive shuttle ($40) but my knees and feet will thank me. I also need to figure out how to eat correctly.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

CaliCole,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529168,Skipped 25 miles and jumped ahead to start at Winding Stair Gap.What a beautiful start to the day with the above waterfall!I was only going to walk to the first shelter (5 miles) but I got there in only 2 hours and it wasn't even noon yet so I kept going. Slow But Steady and I decided we would check out the camping area between this first shelter and the next one. It was only another 4 miles but we never could find it with the directions from our maps - we looked and looked. So we had to keep going. We made it to the Wayah Bald parking area where I hoped we would find campers but there weren't any. I had injured my right foot earlier in the day and by then it was just killing me. Slow But Steady was so great staying with me while I really struggled to keep moving. It was getting late when we got there and I just couldn't go any further. There was a couple of vehicles in the parking area. One was loading up with hikers and didn't have any extra space but the other belonged to the most awesome couple who were visiting from Michigan. They drove me back to Franklin where I found a room at the Comfort Inn.,"Winding Stair Gap

It wasn't feeling much better, so Thursday I went to an urgent care clinic and had it x-rayed just to be sure I didn't have any stress fractures (again).
