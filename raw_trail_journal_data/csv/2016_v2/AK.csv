AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518856,"5 years goes by pretty fast. Seems like it was just yesterday that I was reading everything I could on whiteblaze, and buying everything I could from R.E.I. in preparation for an AT thru hike. Well, that was March of 2011 that I set off on my quest to tame the mountains. I managed to hike around 750 miles in about 2 months and had the time of my life. I met so many amazing people along the way. I got to experience so much awesomeness, and walk away with so many memories and stories to tell that should last me forever or until I get diagnosed with Alzheimer's.",,View Entry,"Dec 30, Wed",0
AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518857,"Since I got off the trail back in 2011, there hasn't been a single day gone by that I haven't thought about it. I figured out pretty quickly that the worst day hiking the AT sure beats the best days in the suburbs. Anybody who has walked a mile on the trail knows that there is something magical about it, and anybody who has failed in their quest to thru hike it knows that the trail can leave a hole in your soul that can only be fixed at the the summit of Mt Katahdin.",,Mt Katahdin,"Dec 31, Thu",0
AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518951,"I purchased a one way non-refundable bus ticket to Georgia...leaving Monday night January 4th from Tampa. It's about a 13 hr bus ride through the night, so i should be on scene sometime around 10:30 am the following morning. I am planning on staying at the Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega. I am waiting to hear back from them about catching a ride from the bus station. I have heard a lot of good things about the Hiker Hostel and am really looking forward to staying there. So, that puts my official start on Wednesday Jan 6th. I just checked the weather forecast, and it looks like its going to be a sunny day with the highs & lows being around 43/34 degrees. Sounds perfect to me. I plan on spending my last days in Florida visiting my brother and tying up loose ends. If you read my 2011 journal and were wondering...He got 10 yrs in prison and is doing really well and in good health and spirit. I have visited him as often as I can and am looking forward to seeing him tomorrow.","Mt Katahdin

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519160,"Well I survived the Greyhound bus ride...I made it to Gainesville, Ga where the owners of the Hiker Hostel in Dalonega picked me up so I could stay there. They are pretty cool people and have a great place. I would definitely recommend staying here. They will drop me off at Springer Mt in the morning. There are some section hikers who are staying here as they have just finished their hike. They were so eager to talk about their experience and it was cool to get some weather details...so far, looks like its going to be cold, very cold. I am expecting temps in the 20's. Looks like theres going to be rain on the way soon...So in case you were wondering what did i forget to pack... Hiking Gaiters... im definitely going to need those. so hopefully I can pick up a pair at the outfitter at neels gap in 3 days.","

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519427,"Day 1On your mark, get set, go!!!So I stayed the night at The Hiker Hostel, which is a really awesome place. The owners are super friendly and very knowledgeable about all things pertaining to the AT. The H.H. is definately a great asset for the trail community. Breakfast was delishous, and the oatmeal was probably the best I've ever had. I got dropped off at the parking lot to Springer Mt with Karen and her dog Cooper. Karen is a newbie to hiking and it is really cool seeing people take their first steps of following their passion. We had to hike a mile to reach the starting point of the AT. We took the customary pictures and chatted for a second on top of the Mt.I took a moment to take it all in. It was a really weird feeling for me. Up until I was standing on top of Springer Mt, I I noticed a lack of excitement leading up to this moment. I didn't have any intentions of thru hiking this year, and especially not in the middle of winter. I kinda did it out of necessity. The last month or so has absolutely sucked for me, I found my life turned upside down and falling apart. I went through my emergency contingency plans alphabetically and ended up on plan ""H"". I basically said forget it, I'm going Hiking...I needed to get away, I needed time to myself, I needed to figure out some things. So i turned to mother nature to try to fix a broken heart and mend a battered soul.As soon as I was standing on top of that Mt, I felt at home. I sincerely felt that for once, I was at the right place at the right time. It felt good to be on the trail again. I was overcome with a feeling of deja vu. I did what any hiker would do...I started hiking. The views were amazing, the weather was perfect. I was really looking forward to seeing Army Rangers out training, and even brought Slim jims for them, but I didn't get so see them. Maybe they were just really well camoflauged...I was planning on staying at Hawk Mt Shelter, but there wern't any hikers there and the privy was closed due to public safety concerns....I didnt want to find out what those concerns were first hand so I took off. I tried to make it to the next shelter but I didn't make it. It got dark and colder so I set up my tent at Cooper Gap. I ended up hiking 12.2 miles.","Springer Mt

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519428,"Day 2I was slow to wake up and get going, as it is very difficult to get out of a warm and cozy sleeping bag and step out into 30 degrees. I must admit it was perfect weather for hiking. I was cruising along at a good pace, trying to take advantage of any good weather. I am always keeping an eye on the weather, and I knew rain was on the way so i got my hike on. I didn't see any northbound thru hikers, only a handful of day hikers with their shiny clean clothes on. I did cross paths with a southbound flip flop hiker named Riptide, who was finishing up with his journey from Harpers Ferry to Springer. We exchanged pleasantries and were on our ways. I ended up doing almost 16 miles, which required me to give maximum effort. I started this adventure without any expectations and only a commitment to myself to give it 100 % every day. I figure enough days in a row of 100 % effort just might get me to Maine, but If I end up hiking for a week, a month so be it, as long as I return home with a smile on my face. This adventure is more about the journey and not so much the destination, although it would be pretty neat to get a picture standing on Mt. Katahdin. By the end of the day it was getting dark, which means colder. The sun sets earlier in the mountains. I was trying to make Woods Hole Shelter, as I was pushing it, I got soaking wet from sweat...yup I broke rule number 1. ...I had to dig down deep, find that self confidence, and push myself to get up those inclines. I did not want to set up my tent knowing rain was imminent. I made it to the shelter as dark fell only to find it empty. I quickly got out of my wet clothes, climbed into my sleeping bag, just in time to listen to the rain fall on a tin roof. It was a cold windy night, which I shared with a mouse.","Cooper Gap

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519429,"Day 3Check Point 1 completeI woke up to rain, and naturally took my sweet time to get up and going. I planned my milage so I would have an easy day to walk in the rain to Neels Gap, which is where you will find the Mt. Crossings Outfitter and Walasi-Yi Hostel. I stayed here before and was looking forward to staying here again. So I got to do about 3 miles up and over Blood Mt, which is only the highest peak on the AT in Ga at around 4,461 feet above sea level. I just so happen to live at sea level in Florida... Blood Mt. is an amazing place with spectacular views. I think i would definitely comeback here and spend the weekend one day. I got to play the temperature game today. It's a struggle to regulate your body temperature while hiking, yet alone while going upwards, and even more so while wearing rain gear. I was constantly putting a layer on or taking a layer off.. and found out the hard way to always layer off before going up. First item on or off is usually beanie and gloves. Since it was raining, I put my rain gear on top of my normal attire. Wrong. Won't do that again. It got hot real quick, even though it was 30-40 degrees out, I was burning up. So...that ment all layers off... yup just me in a rain suit... I still got wet from sweatting, but at least I was warm. Getting wet from the rain means getting cold. I made it up and over Blood Mt relatively easily, as it is basically a rock stairway up and down. I saw a handful of people making their way to the top. I planned on getting a bunk at the hostel, but things dont always go as planned.... the hostel was closed due to plumbing issues and should be open within a week. I wasn't prepared to hike on, so i had to figure out plan B on the fly. Good thing there was the Blood Mt Cabins right next door...I rented a cabin for the night. The owners are a really awesome couple, who were very nice and welcoming. The cabiin was cozy, the kinda cozy where ya want to spend an entire weekend there, and one day I will. There was a variety of snacks and frozen pizza available, which I took full advantage of. It felt great to get out of the cold rain and into a hot shower...And then there is a delima... I was kinda planning my milage to make it into a town to be able to watch the Pittsburgh Steelers kick the crap outta the Bengals in the playoffs...I found out that the game was on Saturday and not Sunday....this breaking news story did not fit my hiking agenda. I was planning on staying at the cabin Friday night, would get back on the trail and hike all day Saturday and Sunday, to get into town by game time Sunday night, to watch the Steelers win, and would get back on the trail Monday morning and hike happily ever after. I made an executive decision to arrange a shuttle ride from the cabin into Helen, Ga to watch the game. This would allow me to do the following: avoid hiking all day Saturday in the rain, get to check out an amazing little town, watch the game, and hopefully allow any thru hikers that are behind an opportunity to catch up to me. So here I am in Helen, catching up on the Journal..Go Steelers!","Woods Hole Shelter

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519451,"Day 4I didn't hike any miles, but I did go swimming.I woke up Saturday morning at the Blood Mt Cabin and arranged for a shuttle ride to Helen, Ga. The driver, a retired gentleman named Sam picked me up and was very eager to tell me everything there was to know about everything. I found him to be informative and knowledgeable. He took the scenic way and it was picture perfect. Sam recommended a stay at The Helendorf Hotel, which was slightly out of my budget, but was a great place with lots of charm. It looks like a castle. Helen has been on my list of places to visit for a while now, and I am glad I got to experience this little town that was inspired by a German Alpine village. I spent my day being a tourist checking out the little shops offering handmade pretzels and fudge. I got to go swimming in the middle of the winter in the mountains in a heated swimming pool. I went to the little country grocery store to resupply. I started this hike with a strong focus on the importance of nutrition. I have adapted the mind set that I am a long distance endurance athlete, and have planned my meals accordingly. I brought protein powder and amino acid drink mix with me that will help my muscles recover from the daily grind of thru hiking. I am paying attention to nutrition labels on everything I buy. I know my food bag might be slightly heavier than most but it will ultimately help my body recover quicker and help me acquire my hiker legs faster which will help lead me to a more enjoyable hiking experience. I know that there are a lot of ups and down hiking the appalachian trail, but none that compare to watching that Steelers vs Bengals playoff game....wow, that might just be the most intense, action packed game I have ever seen. Go Steelers!I arranged a ride back to Neels Gap, but the driver wasn't able to pick me up until 1pm...so I have to rework my mileage. I am looking forward to getting back on the trail as the weather will be sunny with temps in the 20-30's ...perfect.","Neels Gap Hostel

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519562,"Day 5Weather man said it's going to be sunny.I made arrangements to get a shuttle ride from Helen back to Neels Gap after calling several shuttle drivers. Apparently I skipped the most logical town and went to the further destination ..what ever, I really enjoyed Helen. The shuttle driver could only pick me up at 1pm, so I got a super late start back to the trail.After watching the weather report that morning and hearing""cold but SUNNY "" I was thrilled to be back on the trail. I passed through the neals gap outfitter/hostel, for those that don't know, the trail goes right through a very old and cool looking building. About a quarter of a mile up the mountain I saw this huge grey cloud take over the sky (Grey is my favorite color). It was a giant fog rolling in, and to my amusement it was turning everything in it's path white. It was so cold out that the moisture from the fog was turning into snow, and I was watching it happen live from the front row. That was one of the coolest things I've seen. There was absolutely now way I was going to make it to my destination of Low Gap shelter so I went with the under used shelter that is an extra 1.2 miles off the trail...Whitely. Let me tell you...that was an awesome 1.2 miles to walk with some incredible views looking out. And yes I know the weather in the mountains can be unpredictable and has a mind of its own. I know that I should be prepared for the worst and expect the best. Sometimes the worst is the best...as in I froze pretty good that night.I have never been so cold in my life. The weather man said it was going to be sunny, and I didnt see the sun once. I saw snow. I find that hilarious. I met my first thru hiker!!!! I was super excited to meet somebody else out there. Inspector Gadget was wrapped up in all of his sleeping attire in the corner of Whitely shelter. He is a tripple crowner and has done just about every other trail out there. So, needless to say, he has tons of experience and it was good to talk to him about the other trails and other gear..his ultra light set up was maybe 9 lbs...Im carrying 30.It was a very windy night that night. I put on almost every piece of clothing I had and I froze. The wind was intense and no matter what I did it found its was into my sleeping bag. My water bottles were frozen before I even got close to the shelter. My stove was frozen. Most of my food was frozen..except the slim jims!!!! So slim Jims for dinner it was. Inspector Gadget said it was 8 degrees...and add the wind chill...probably a whole lot colder. I slept with my stove, phone, ipod, and shoes in my sleeping bag that night. I woke up in the morning and my feet were actually numb with 2 pairs of socks on. It took about 2 hrs of hiking to thaw them out. In a weird kinda way, I enjoyed freezing. Its strange, but It was something I've never experienced before, and probably will never again..until tomorrow night. It makes you appreciate mother nature and puts a new perspective on how spoiled I have it living in a house with central heat and air, running hot water, and a comfortable bed. I guess I have taken all the comforts for granted and mother nature punched me in the face to remind me how good I have it.","Helen, Ga

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519565,"Day 6I survived.I wasn't able to get much sleep last night due to a slight case of freezing. The sun came out to play and I wasn't ready to crawl out of my sleeping bag. It must have been around 10 before I got moving around. My feet were like ice cubes. Inspector Gadget and I made our way north, he left me in his dust as I was moving in slow motion. This day was the first time I actually questioned myself..wtf am I doing. The idea of throwing in the towel was the topic of the day in AK land. I must admit all of the encouragement from you guys really paid off big time here...and a special thank you goes out to my hiking buddies from 2011 Triton and Bum Knee for their support. I put it to good use and kept on hiking on. While I was contemplating on what I was going to do with my life, should I stay or should I go? Winkle walks by. It was refreshing to have someone to chat with for a second to put that internal stuff on the back burner. She actually mentioned that she was following my trail journal. I knew at that moment..I was going to keep on going. I stopped in Low Gap Shelter for lunch, and there were some SOBO'S hanging out with Inspector Gadget. The SOBO'S continued south, The inspector went north, and I stayed put. Low gap is a very cool spot and one of my favorite places so far. There are 2 mountains that kinda meet right there and each has its own stream trickling down and forming a ""Y"" right in front of the shelter. I decided to kick back, relax, and recuperate from the wild night before. As I was watching the sun start to set over the mountain, in walks Subman and Slipnot. 2 really cool guys. Subman was hiking along with Slipnot for a few days. Slipnot is going all the way to Maine. I have to admit that it is very comforting having somebody else out here on this journey.I slept in the shelter by myself as Subman and Slipnot were staying in their tents. I was getting ready for another round of freezing but the wind was no where nearly as bad as the previous night. It turned out to be a really nice night, until a mouse walked over my face. I wasn't in the mood to play with the mouse so he took it upon himself to inspect all of my gear while I slept and decided to chew on my lid to my jetboil. Thanks Mr. Mouse, I always wanted an extra hole in my lid.","Whitley Gap Shelter
",Low Gap Shelter,"Jan 11, Mon",5
AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519566,"Day 7A hot shower was calling my name.I woke up at Low Gap feeling pretty good. The extra rest worked. Subman was headed back to his truck, leaving Slipnot and I to continue towards Maine. He got a head start on me leaving camp, and I wasnt able to catch up to him..he must hike really fast. At one point I was thinking I shoulda caught up to him by now and was convinced he made a wrong turn outta camp. Nope He just walks faster than me. And thats all right. I am hiking my own hike. It was as close to perfect weather as it could possible be. The sun was shining and now the right side of my face has a tan. I stopped to check out some really cool views along the way. I saw a bunch of frozen icicles hanging down a bunch of rocks. Today was on auto pilot, I was cruising the whole way. I attribute that to the protein powder working, and my legs responding accordingly.  I brought 1 lb of protein and a bag of ""Aminolytes by Beast "" I figure every time I fill up my water bottles in the morning, I will make a smoothie and mix the two supplements. During my 2nd water fill up, I add in a ""Emergency mix"" and 3rd fill up, I add ""Propel"". I also take a multivitamin daily. My food choices for snacks include Slim Jims, an assortment of protein bars, and mini snickers. For lunch I brought some sliced turkey and cheese from the deli. I figure it is good to go as we are basically walking in refrigerator temperature. I really dont like cooking dinner, so I try to keep it simple and go with instant mashed potatoes or pasta sides. I try to eat regularly through out the day and stop at cool viewpoints for snack time.As I got closer to Unicoi Gap, the lure of town was calling my name. Hiawassee was right down the road, I could smell the cooking, and I knew from last time there was an all you can eat buffet at a steakhouse...I figured I would try to hitch a ride into town and if that didnt work I would hike on to tray Mt. The very forst person I asked for a ride said sure hop on in...success! Turns out the gentleman who gave me the ride was retired and a former thru hiker...he knew all about hikers needing rides to towns and was glad to help out. I got dropped off at the Budget Inn a place that Ive stayed at before and is know to be super friendly towards hikers...but was told today they were closed..they didn't look closed. What ever, I continued down the road and got a room at the Holiday Inn. I immediately took a shower and went to find that all you can eat restaurant...and I ate all I could for only $7.50...your looking at one satisfied customer. I spent the rest of the day in the hot tub...Subman is going to link up with Slipknot at Dicks Creek Gap and head into town tomorrow night. I will high tail it outta town and make my way to Dicks Creek Gap to meet up with them when they return from their stay in town.I should be in NC soon.","Low Gap Shelter
",Unicoi Gap (Hiawassee),"Jan 12, Tue",10
AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519792,"Day 8""No one is going to walk that last mile for you""...I woke up at the Holiday Inn in Hiawassee, I checked the messages on my trail journal and saw that Subman would be able to give me a ride back to the gap on his way to meet up with Slipknot. This was most helpful, as now I didn't have to try to arrange a ride and could sleep in a bit longer. I have the feeling that Subman has the DNA of a trail angel...I felt great after getting rest. I was ready for the climb outta the gap up Rocky Mt. Once I got to the top, the weather was perfect,there were some amazing views, and the right song came across my ipod, so lets just say I had a dance party all by my self on top of Rocky Mt. I have been listening a lot to music as I hike and I heard a Jay Z song that made me think of one of my best friends JD who passed away a few years ago. I thought he would have really enjoyed hiking. For the next few miles or so, I was reminiscing about the close knit group of friends that I had back in the day, and how that is very similar to the close knit hiking community. Hikers have a way of taking care of their own. The friendships that you make on the trail will last a life time. When I was hiking in 2011 I met some of the most incredible people ever. It really it me as I was walking along this section as it was where I first met John F'N Wayne. He quickly became part of my hiking group back in 2011. The memories quickly came rolling in, and I found a few awesome spots along the trail to stop to remember them. John Wayne went on to finish the trail that year, only to pass away in a tragic hiking accident in Alabama. He is a legend and the hiking community will miss him dearly.The day was going great, I was having a lot of fun...until I came across what seemed as a never ending uphill climb that is know as Kelly Knob. Straight up, for hours. Just when you think you have reached the top, you are wrong, there is more uphill. There is always more uphill to go. I had to tap into my second and third wind to make it to the top. This was definitely a snack depleting, water bottle draining, layer off kinda battle. I decided to bypass Deep Gap shelter, put it in high gear and make it three more miles to Dick Creek Gap where I could get a bunk at The Top of Georgia Hostel. I had to night hike out of the woods to make it, which is pretty scary, but the thought of walking down a crazy mountain highway to the hostel in the dark was even more scarier. I am super glad TOG was able to pick me up. I was exhausted by the time I got to the hostel. Not only is the trail a geographical rollercoaster, but can also be an emotional rollercoaster too. I really appreciate the trail for giving me the time to think and remember.","Unicoi Gap (Hiawassee)

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519793,"Day 9Easy does it.I woke up early at the Top of Georgia Hostel, which is a cool place owned by Sir Packs a Lot. He gave me a ride to Dick's creek gap after breakfast. My plan for the previous day where I hiked 16 miles from gap to gap was to put myself in a good position to be able to link up with Slipknot when he returned from his stay in Hiawassee. We made plans to meet up at Plum Orchard Shelter which was 4 miles in. I got there first and took a nap while waiting for him. I figured since it was a really beautiful day out that we would hike on to the next shelter. I was a little surprised that he wanted to stay put for the night. It went against my hiker game plan of taking advantage of the nice days to get miles in, knowing rain was on its way. My need to socialize got the best of me and I decided to stay put and hangout with Slipknot. I started a fire and we sat around and chatted for a while. The jury reached a verdict and found Slipknot to be a pretty cool guy. Plum Orchard is a really cool three level shelter. I climbed to the top and went to sleep early.","Dick's Creek Gap

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519794,"Day 10Rainy day bluesI woke up to rain, which left me in no hurry to get up and hike 12 miles. I finally crawled out of my warm and cozy sleeping bag, put on my rain gear and set off north. About a mile into the hike my rain gear failed me and left me completely soaked from head to toe. Wanna talk about misery? I quickly realized that I was in a bad situation and wasn't going to make it the 12 miles before I became a hiker popsicle. I stopped into the next shelter to get the wet clothes off as quickly as I could and climb into my sleeping bag to warm up. I am so glad I stopped as I noticed my sleeping bag was starting to get wet too. If I would have continued no doubt the sleeping bag would have been drenched and woulda left me no way to warm up. And yes I had a rain cover on my pack. As soon as I climbed in my sleeping bag and got warm, a southbounder named Nat Geo and a puppy came running into the shelter soaking wet. The wet dog made a B-line to me and got real familiar with my clean stuff. I didn't mind, as it was a miserable situation and we were all in it together hikers and hiker puppy. Turns out the dog was roaming the trail all alone and Nat Geo rescued it and was looking after it. He didn't have much food left as he was planning on making it to town that day but got holed up in the shelter with me. I donated some Banana Walnut oatmeal for the puppy who devoured it.","Plum Orchard Shelter
",Muskrat Creek Shelter,"Jan 15, Fri",7
AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519795,"Day 11I can do it!I woke up from Muskrat Creek Shelter expecting it to be another rainy day. I was delighted to see blue skies and the sun shinning. My legs were fresh, and I was well rested. I checked the elevation chart in the Thru Hiker's companion and it looked like favorable terrain ahead of me. I wanted to kinda make up for the 2 low mileage days so I loaded my pockets with snacks and tied my shoes nice and tight. I parted ways with Nat Geo and the puppy and took off north. My ipod was outta commission from rain getting it wet. I must admit this was a slight blow to my moral, as I was really enjoying hiking with music. I got into a groove and was cruising along, my body seemed to be in sync with my breathing and I felt like I would walk forever. I met up with Slipknot at Carter Gap shelter who was airing his stuff out to dry. I told him I was feeling great and was gonna keep going. I checked the data book and knew there were 2 more shelters ahead of me, then the road crossing at winding stair gap..
I had plenty of daylight left and plenty of gas left i the tank. I was in the zone all day. I didn't stop for lunch, as I ate protein bars on the move. I climbed to the top of Albert Mt just before sunset and went to the top of the fire tower to take a few pictures. I would have to say that this was my favorite view so far on the trail. It felt like i was actually climbing a mountain as opposed to hiking on a trail. I kept on going.
I reached Long Branch Shelter as the sun was going down. I figured it was 3.5 miles to the next shelter and I was feeling great. I put on my headlamp and took off into the dark. For a second, I thought to myself that I am crazy. At this point I had already hiked 20 miles, it was night time, and I was getting my hike on. I was super excited that I was actually pushing myself to the extreme, getting out of my comfort zone and doing something amazing. Night hiking is intense. 
I reached Rock Gap shelter and left it in my dust, I was going all the way to winding Stair Gap. Not too long after I passed the shelter, I wondered how much juice did the batteries in my headlamp have in them??? I have never ever attempted to hike 10 miles in the dark before and had no clue if the batteries would last the 4 hours or so that it would take. 
3 miles to go... I told myself I can do this!!!
2 miles to go... I told myself I am doing this!!!
1 Mile to go.... I told myself I hope those batteries last!!!
I was overcome with emotion as I walked off the trail and onto the pavement of Winding Stair Gap. I was so proud of myself. I just hiked 30 miles, 10 of them in the dark. I can do anything I set my mind to. And ya know what...my legs felt pretty good. I started hiking this day around 8 am, and reached the gap at 10pm. I stuck my thumb up, hoping to catch a ride, but nobody stopped. I got out the book and looked up the number to Ron Haven's budget Inn in Franklin, NC. He was away but the gentleman filling in gave me a number to his friend who might be able to give me a ride in to town.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520574,"Day 12Day off!I got into Franklin kinda late Saturday night. I booked a room at Ron Haven's budget Inn for 2 nights. I stashed my stuff in the room and set off to find a hot meal. I found a Domino's Pizza that was still open a couple of blocks away from the hotel and stopped in. Since I was walking and it was 20 degrees outside, I asked them if they could deliver the pizza to the room for me so that way it wouldnt be frozen.. they did. It was the best pizza Ive ever had. I was surprised to wake up at 8 am. I figured I would have been able to sleep half the day away. My legs felt pretty good, just a tad bit sore, and my left knee was a little tight. I stretched and then went for a walk around the town. Since it was Sunday morning just about everything was closed. I got some snacks and headed back to my room to get ready to watch football...the Steelers were playing later that night. I took a nap in the bathtub... woke up in time to walk over to Mulligan's Bar to watch the game. The food was great and the service was better!","Franklin Nc

After watching the weather reports on the TV and talking to a bunch of locals in Franklin, I was convinced that the in coming blizzard was no joke. I had my eyes set on The Smokies in the next few days which would have put me right in the cross hair of the storm. The locals were saying they anticipated the roads would be closed and impassible, so if anything happened, I'd be on my own...and chances of something bad happening were going up. I definitely didn't want to be ""that guy"" who put himself in a bad situation and now needed to be rescued. So now the question is ...What am I to do?A. Go through the SmokiesB. Try to orchestrate a ride around the Smokies C. Stay put and hunker down in a hotel roomD. Rent a car and go on a road tripHiking through the Smokies during a blizzard was an obvious no go. Trying to orchestrate a flip flop reroute around the Smokies and then trying to get back there after Katahdin seemed like a major pain in the ass. Sitting put in a hotel room by myself for 3 or 4 days seemed boring, so I chose option D. I rented a car and took off for the open road. I figured I had about 3 or 4 days of good weather before the storm was going to unleash its fury. I bought an atlas and decided to stick to the back roads. I spent the next 3 days hanging out in Ashville NC, Greenville,SC and Athens, GA. I had an amazing time and met some really cool people, and got to eat some great BBQ. I had a blast driving through the mountains...my first time getting to do that.","Franklin NC

We drove up the back roads through Georgia to stay in Helen. I had a feeling that he would really like the town and I was right. It was pretty cool getting to see my dad be a tourist. We spent Saturday walking around the town and then we hiked up Blood Mountain....I bet my dad's legs are still sore...Sunday morning, Feb 28th my dad dropped me off at Amicalola Falls.Day 1Early Sunday morning I walked into the visitor center of the park and was greeted by Clarity, the new ridge runner. I signed in and was thru hiker number 221. I said adios to my dad and walked through the arch way to start the 8 mile approach trail to the summit of the AT. On the way I climbed a 600 step stairway up the water fall...I am not so sure this was the best idea ever, as I have already done this in my previous hiker life, but I thought it was easier for me to do this than to try to have my dad navigate the forest service roads leading up to Springer Mt.I reached the summit to find out the hiker legs that I developed back in January were no where to be found in February. There were a couple of other hikers that were starting to gather up there. We all signed the register and posed for the picture. Some of the hikers wanted to camp out on top of Springer to officially start their hikes on Leap Day...me? I was getting my hike on, and going northI made it 11 miles (counting the 8 from the approach trail) to Stover Creek Shelter and set up my sleeping bag up in the loft, which turned out to be more of a bear's den... as there was a hibernating polar bear in there all night. I heard a helicopter fly over pretty low over the shelter.","Amicalola Falls

I learned my lesson and decided to sleep in my tent tonight. I packed up and ate my breakfast of watermelon pop-tarts, contrary to what you may be thinking, they are actually pretty good. I came up with a new game plan for this hike. I am going to try to avoid cooking any hot meals, this will save me time and the hassle of cooking and cleaning every day. I got to meet a bunch of pretty cool fellow hikers while playing leap frog with them throughout the day. I took a break to checkout Long Creek Falls, which provided a cool atmosphere to get out of the direct line of fire coming from the sun. I thought this was supposed to still be winter time, but I found myself getting pretty hot and sweaty, and managed to take a sponge bath without the sponge. I caught up to quite a few hikers on the trail but failed again to see any Army Rangers... either their camouflage is really good or I am just day dreaming too much.","Stover Creek

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522455,"Day 3It pays to be a winner.I set my tent up at Gooch Shelter far away from anybody else as I was determined to get some quality dream time. During the middle of the night the local owls decided to have a party and were hooting and hollaring for a while. While I was eating breakfast, I was checking over the AT weather app and going over the AT guide book for logistics. Turns out we had an incoming storm that was threatening to rain off and on all day and hit pretty hard at night. When I hear of rain, I think of town, as I absolutely despise hiking in the rain. Most of the hikers that I was with that morning were thinking of camping at a camping spot 8 to 10 miles away, but I had my eyes set on Neels Gap; only 16 miles away.I had my first taste of hiker legs, which was a tease as they did not last too long. I came across a hiking club of retirees and got to meet ""Ranger Bob"". If you are reading this, thanks for the snack and I hope to see you again in Maine sir. I think my strategy of eating on the go is really paying off as I am staying energized throughout the entire day.There was a logistical consideration to mention about my decision to hike 16 miles. There was a new rule put in place by the ATC which required anyone who camped in a specific stretch of trail...(Jarrad gap to Neels gap) to have a bear resistant canister beginning march 1st. Since today was March 1st... meant there was no stopping once I past the point of no return. I had to make it all the way to Neels gap or risk getting fined $200, as I do not have a bear canister. I convinced Paul, who I shall call ""The Big Guy"" to hike with me to the gap. He is a recently retired Army helicopter pilot and a pretty cool guy. We were planning on getting bunks at the hostel, but when we got there, we found out they were full, so we went halvsies on a cabin at Blood Mountain Cabin Rentals. We also got Eric to stay with us. I stayed here back in January and absolutely love this place. The owner Matt is a wonderful guy and I would recommend to anyone to stay here. Shortly after we got settled in, the rain came pouring down. We were warm, dry and munching on pizza while everyone else was hunkered down in the rain.","Gooch Gap

I checked the weather on the news and the weatherman said that today was going to be a sun shiney day. We left the cabin and headed over to the Outfitter at Neels Gap called Mountain Crossings. There were doom and gloom looking clouds hovering over head and the temperature was dropping quickly. I took a few pictures of the iconic building that the AT passes through and we set off down the trail. Heading up the mountain it began to snow. Not too long after everything turned white, the sun came out and put a shine on everything. I thought it was very odd that it was snowing while the sun was shining. The struggle of trail life is real. This particular stretch of trail going north out of Neels Gap is very picture friendly, as there are many spots that offer amazing views. Eric hiked on ahead of us, while me and ""The Big Guy"" stopped to admire the sights and take pics. There were portions of the trail that went along the ridgeline which gave the wind an opportunity to pound the left side of my face while the sun was putting the smack down on the right side of my face. So half of my face was cold while the other was getting a sun burn...no selfies today guys. Basically I got to walk in a winter wonderland all day until we reached our destination at Low Gap Shelter. There were only a handful of hikers here. It got real cold real quick, so I was in my sleeping bag before the sun went down.","Blood Mt Cabins

I managed to stay cold all night and woke up kinda miserable, only to find the privy was outta order... that is a major BUMMER! I checked the weather and heard the word that there was a storm rolling in at 2pm. I talked with ""The Big Guy"" about aiming for Tray Mt Shelter which was 15 miles away. I let him know there was a road crossing at Unicoi Gap which was 10 miles away where we could get a ride into Hiawassi if the weather sucked. I got to the Gap and checked the weather app and found out that the storm was going to be worse than I was expecting so I decided to head in to town. I left a note for ""The Big Guy"" so he would know what I was up to.I hitched a ride into Hiawassi from 2 section hikers. On the drive in, it began to snow pretty good. I got dropped off at The holiday Inn Express (I like this place) and took a shower and headed directly to Daniel's Steakhouse. I should point out that it is an all you can eat buffet, and I ate 6 plates of BBQ ribs, kielbasa and sauerkraut, mash potatoes and fried okra...for only $7.50 !! I left outta there waddling like a pregnant duck. I finally got some zzz's during my food coma.

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522612,"Day 6Snow in them there hills.I woke up at the Holiday Inn Express and made my way down for their breakfast, which was a contributing factor in the decision making process of where to stay in Hiawassi. I was fortunate enough to meet a thru hiking couple who were waiting on their shuttle ride back to Unicoi Gap and was able to catch a ride with them. They just made my day just a tad bit easier. Over night the incoming storm dumped a lot of snow on the ground..remember I'm from Florida so any amount of snow is a lot to me. The trail looked beautiful all covered in white, and I took my time making my way up Tray Mountain. I think I was slightly lethargic from my all you can eat adventure at Daniel's Steakhouse, 6 plates of BBQ ribs will tend to do that to you. I reached the summit and was taken back by all of the awesome views along the way. My plan was to make it 13 miles or so to Deep Gap Shelter but that wasn't going to happen. Going down the mountain was no where near as pretty as going up, as the sun had started to melt the snow and turned the trail into a slushy. The pretty white stuff turned into a nasty brown mush, and was absolutely no fun to walk in. My progress was slowed drastically. I decided to camp short of the shelter at Addis Gap. There was a pretty awesome couple there camping in preparation for their upcoming thru hike. They had a very nice fire going and it was very easy to make friends with them. (Hi EL Wood). We were later joined by ""Mountain Man"" and had a pretty fun time hanging out by the fire all night. I will have to admit that this night was the most fun I've had so far.Once the sun goes down, the cold comes out, so I crawled into my sleeping bag to call it a night. Shortly thereafter, I was woken up by a bunch of coyotes hootin and hollaring all night. I could here them off in the distance coming from up the trail towards Kelly Knob. No big deal, just coyotes being coyotes. I dozed back off to la la land, only to be awoken again by the coyotes, this time they were a bit closer to our camp. I started forming an action plan...just in case. I went back to sleep. I was woken up a third time by these hooligans, except for now this time they were in my comfort zone...I unzipped my sleeping bag and prepared myself to be ready to judo chop a coyote in the face if they dared attempt to steal my lunch box. To be fair, there was Jerk Chicken from the deli in there and how could anybody yet alone a coyote resist such temptation? Crisis avoided as the coyotes chickened out. Thankfully, as I am sure filling out an incident report like that would require filling out a lot of paper work and I don't have time for that.","Hiawassi

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522614,"Day 71 week AnniversaryI woke up feeling kinda tired and was in no hurry to get going. I knew there was Dick's Creek Gap coming up and an opportunity to get into Top of Georgia Hostel in about 6 miles. I decided that after a week of hiking decent mileage days I would treat myself to something nice and hike a half day.Up until this point, my left knee has been kinda stiff from my January expedition, and I figured that I could use a little bit of rest to help it get back to 100%. I have been making rather good time and have been passing lots of hikers, I thought I'd use this time at the Hostel to get to hangout with everybody. While I was packing up my camp in the morning several hikers that I haven't seen before asked me if I was AK...uh oh... what did I do now??? I asked if they worked for the Feds or any other law enforcement agency and then admitted that they caught me. They apparently were following behind me their entire hike, seeing my signature in the shelter registers, only to be a day late and a dollar short of meeting me in person. They were excited to finally put a face to my signature. While making my way up and over Kelly Knob, which is my least favorite section of trail I have ever done...and I have done it 3 times now... I met a hiker from Turkey who was trying to be the first hiker to reach Katahdin this year. Good luck buddy. I also was fortunate to meet a SOBO named ""Rookie"" who was finishing up his 2,000 mile journey. There were 2 pairs of hikers attempting to hike the Georgia section of the AT on their spring breaks...good luck guys. I made it to Dick's Creek Gap before lunch time and caught a ride to the Hostel by the shuttle van. I was welcomed by a bunch of fellow hikers there and felt right at home. I dropped off my stinky laundry for the caretaker to throw in the wash and we set off for town....you guessed it Daniel's Steakhouse twice in the same week!!! I am now back at the hostel relaxing and having a good time hanging out with everybody. There is a really good bunch here tonight.

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523081,"Day 8 Good bye GA, Hello NC...I had a great time hanging out at the Top of Georgia Hostel. I really enjoyed spending time with all of the fellow hikers and being able to get to know their stories. I went to bed the night before being tortured by the smell of homemade pastries being made in advance of breakfast the following morning. I was eager to get my hands on the muffins, cakes and other goodies that the staff had made for us. I hopped on the shuttle ride back to Dick's Creek Gap and started following the white blazes north. The weather was perfect and the company was even better. I got to spend some time hiking with 2 chicks from Kentucky, Jelly Ankles and Cheetah and really enjoyed their company. Leaving a town gives ya the advantage of being able to pack in some quality food to enjoy on your first day back that would be too heavy to carry for several days. After walking for a few hours, my appetite kicked in and I was really glad I just so happened to have a fresh Italian sub on hand to conquer my hunger. I took a lunch break at Plumb Orchard Shelter, which is something I have not been doing as I have been eating on the go. I have been loading up on foods that I don't have to cook or prepare at all like granola & protein bars and slim jims. It gives me the ability to snack all day to keep my energy levels up and is super convenient not having to fuss with cooking and cleaning dishes every day.This day was sort of a major milestone for us as we crossed our first state line. We were welcomed into NC with a very nice uphill at Bly Gap, where we saw the iconic tree that confirms your accomplishment. This is also where I met ""Coco Ken"" from coco beach FL, and ""Quick"". One state down, 13 to go. As the caravan of Jelly Ankles, Cheetah, Coco Ken, Quick and I went up hill we began talking about our favorite foods to help motivate or rather distract us from the struggle of going upwards. We reached our destination of Muskrat Creek Shelter and set up camp. We were met there by other hikers who have been traveling within our hiking bubble.","Top of Georgia Hostel

The trail through this section was super nice today and I really enjoyed the hike to Carter Gap. The more I hike, the easier it gets, and the easier it gets, the more I like to hike. Funny how that happens. We had a great group gathered at camp and it is neat to see the chemistry and personalities of everyone starting to gel together.

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523084,"Day 10A day away from town and I can smell it. Woke up very excited knowing that today we would get to climb Mt. Albert, one of my favorite places on the AT. The caravan today consisted of Quick, Shrink, Jelly Ankles, and Cheetah, we had a very enjoyable hike that was fueled with jokes and one liners. As we neared Albert, we could see the observation tower that stands on top, and I offered to buy anyone an ice cream who was brave enough to climb to the top of the tower. ON the trail, ice cream is powerful motivator. Going up is more like rock climbing than hiking and was a lot of fun. As we reached the summit, it was time for everyone to earn their ice cream, which everyone did. The views from up there are absolutely amazing, and are worth every bit of the climb up to 5,250 ft. After, snack time, we headed down the mountain towards Rock Gap. A couple of weeks ago, the shelter there had a tree fall on it during a storm and I wasn't sure what to expect when we got there. On the way we were engulfed with a huge cloud of smoke from a near by fire, after a quick phone call to Ron Haven, I was relieved to know that the fire was under control and that we were not walking into an inferno. Through the smoke I could see a shelter standing in the distance and there was the usual suspects waiting our arrival. It appeared most of the hikers were opting to sleep in their tents and hammocks which left a pretty vacant shelter. Knowing that there would be a shuttle ride waiting for us at 9 at Winding Stair Gap, and taking into consideration that I am not the most eager person to wake up early and pack up camp, I decided it would be in my best interest to sleep in the shelter to save time from having to break down my tent. WRONG. Just after I had my bed made in the shelter, he had a sudden influx of unexpected hikers arriving to camp. They made a B-line for the shelter and all 6 of them wanted to cuddle with me. I slept in my tent...and since all of tenting sites were taken, that left zero flat space for me, so I ended up sleeping on a sloped spot near the water hole. I will admit it is almost impossible to sleep while you feel like your are sliding down the hill. I was glad to hear the owls, knowing it was almost time to hike the 3 miles or so to get into Franklin.","Carter Gap

I have to say that my legs finally felt 100 % and secretly giggled to my self when Quick suggested we sprint to Winding Stair Gap....I left him in my dust. I thoroughly enjoyed the down hill to the gap at a rather fast pace. It felt great to max out and push myself to my limits. I reached the gap to meet up with several hikers who were returning from town and making their way back to the trail. They had their hands filled with 12 packs of soda, which they were leaving behind for fellow hikers...I was a witness to trail magic in the making. The rest of the group made their way down and we had probably had 20 or so hikers there waiting for a ride into town. A local guy named Rodney stopped by with a truck load of awesomeness. He dropped his tailgate and set up a picnic for the hikers which consisted of fresh fruit, home made cookies, and coffee. The cookies didn't last too...It required 2 vehicles to get all of the hikers into town. The first van was driven by the legend Ron Haven himself, with Baltimore Jack riding shotgun. Ron made arrangements with the local transit shuttle bus to help pick up the rest of the hikers, and offered to pay the $3 fee per rider. I shared a room with ""Quick"" and we set off for all the luxuries that a town has to offer. We had a great time hanging out at the local outfitter, Outdoor 76. A must stop for any hiker in the area. We enjoyed hanging out at the Lazy Hiker Brewery and getting an amazing meal at the Food Truck in the parking lot.

It turned out to be another hot day with a nice climb up right outta the gap. I started noticing a few birds and more green shrubbery, with is a welcomed sight after over a hundred or so miles of looking at the remnants of winters misery.We took a quick detour from the trail to run up Siler's Bald, which was worth the extra effort to see the incredible 360 views. We met ""Delightful"", who was wrapping up the 3rd trail on her journey to earn her triple crown. We later found out that many of the hikers skipped the steep climb up Siler's Bald to save their legs ...but like most things in life you get what ya pay for and the view was worth it for me. There were many cool views along the way, which I wasn't able to get any pictures of because my phone was all packed away trying to avoid being a casualty of a looming rain cloud. It never rained but sure was a very hot and humid day.Quick and I stopped at Wayah Shelter and met up with the usual hikers who have been in our bubble. We decided to continue on hiking to set ourselves up for a nice stroll into the N.O.C. in case it was going to rain the following morning.

I was completely worn out, which makes laying on the ground in a sleeping bag an easy thing to do. The temperature was absolutely perfect, which means I was about to drift of into la la land relatively quickly....that is until somebody started shining a a flashlight in my tent!!!! The only other hiker at this spot was Quick, who was in no condition to be shining flashlights into tents...and this wasn't a hikers kinda light either, which means it could only be a local...shining a locally owned flashlight directly into my tent. Clearly, hiking/camping/walking in the woods at night rule # 1 states never ever shine a flash light into somebody's tent in the middle of the night, after they have hiked 20 miles, and are trying to get some sleep....and rule # 2 clearly states that if you are walking in the woods in the middle of the night and stumble across a tent with a tired hiker sleeping in it...don't have an out loud conversation about how you found a tent.I some how managed to get some quality sleep that night, and woke up super ready to go. I was kinda surprised to find my first blister. We had only 7 miles to hike to get down to the N.O.C. On the way we stopped off at the Wesser Bald Observation tower and saw the picturesque views. Up until this point, I would have to award this observation tower with a first place medal for best view on the AT. 
Heading into the N.O.C. was an almost never ending down hill, which was pretty devastating on my knees. As we crossed the bridge leading into the center, we were greeted with a trail magic picnic where we had burgers and hot dogs. It was very relaxing to just hangout at the river and day dream for a while. We stopped off at the outfitter, grabbed lunch at the restaurant, and got ourselves a room.

I was enjoying watching the ducks playing on the river.I managed to find a pretty awesome deal on a new rain jacket..I paid $30 for a brand new $100 jacket at the outfitter...and that helped relieve some of the anxiety I was having about hiking in the rain as I didn't trust the integrity of my other rain jacket to keep me dry.

Thankfully. I have to admit that the climb up to Sassafrass Gap took a lot out of me. We got to the first shelter and I was content on staying put, specially with a thunderstorm on the way. Quick and Lorax decided to go on. I spent a bout an hour humming and hawing about wether I should stay put and be dry or be brave and go get wet. After careful deliberations with a determining factor of knowing that this shelter was going to be a mad house, jammed packed with hung over hikers, I decided to test out my new rain jacket. I climbed Cheoah Bald in the pouring rain and had lots of fun doing it. Unfortunately, there weren't any amazing views as there would be on a sunny day. I met up with Quick and Lorax at Stecoah Gap where they were hanging out with ""Brave"" and ""Forward"" who were providing trail magic...in the rain..and thats how you earn the designation of trail angel. After eating hot dogs and drinking hot cocoa, we all decided to crash at the Cabin in the Woods Hostel. I felt very fortunate to have made the tough decision of leaving the comforts of a dry shelter to hike in the rain and push myself to go above and beyond ,y comfort levels (I really don't like hiking in the rain), and it pays to be a winner.

Feeling clean and rested I was ready to go, but I wouldn't stay that way for long. The trail was a mess after the rain, and sloshing through the mud wore me out pretty quickly. There seemed to be a lot of ups and downs which were wrecking havoc on my poor little knees...so let's just say the trail was a pain in my knees, and as a result I managed to slip and fall down not once, not twice, but a whopping three times this day!!! According to my calculations and scientific analysis, that is 3 times too many. My knees were causing me to go slow, so the guys were a head of me most of the day. By the time I pulled into Fontana Dam, I was over it. I made the executive decision to get a room at the lodge and call it a day. I made Quick and The Lorax an offer they couldn't refuse and they stayed too. Funny how the threat of a hot shower and comfy pillow can influence a hiker's decisions. This was my first time at the Lodge, and I really enjoyed my stay there. The food was excellent, I had the meatloaf and could really go for another piece right now. I got to meet Carl, a ridgerunner, who was able to give us lots of good intel on the trail through the Smokies.

Except there seemed to be a delay...it might have had something to do with an exotic car show that was setting up in the parking lot of the lodge? I'm sure a Ferrari and Lamborghini will have that effect on most guys,but not me, I could care less;I just want to see a bear! There were also some arrangements between The Lorax, The Mayor, and Schweps that needed to be worked out about the end of their AT warm up hike for the PCT.

To be honest the first day of hiking into the Smokies is just like every other day of hiking we have had up to this point, there are the same boring dead looking trees, and not much else to see. We heard the news that there were several sick hikers at the lodge and weren't taking any chances of staying in the shelter to minimize our risk of catching Noro, so everyone slept out in their tents.","Fontana Dam

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525332,"Day 20It's all down hill from here.I woke up early and had my eyes set on Clingman's Dome, the tallest point on the AT at 6,643 ft. We were very fortunate to have perfect weather and amazing views from the observation tower, and I swear I could almost see forever. Everyone took the customary pictures and we headed north. I knew from my previous hiking trip in 2011, we were approaching Davenport Gap, which is an opportunity to hitch a ride into Gatlinburg, Tn and I was intending on doing so. This town is a bizarre mix of Disneyland and Las Vegas, so I knew I could get something good to eat there. I was starting to taste the flavors of town when I arrived at the gap, which is basically a parking lot full of tourists taking selfies at the border sign between NC/TN, and was immediately greeted with a ham sandwich. Rule number 17 states that after you hike several miles on the AT in a day and are presented with a Ham Sandwich, eat it; so I did, and it was the best one I've had in my entire life. Trail Magic is the best kind of magic, and I was really appreciative of the graciousness of our magicians. Quick ans I quickly caught a ride into town and got dropped off at the outfitters. We were able to stash out packs inside which enabled us to blend in more easily with the tourists allowing us to avoid the hundreds of questions and picture requests that were sure to follow. We made a pit stop at Walgreen's and headed over to Mc'Donalds... earlier in the day""Large"" made a request if we stopped into town to bring back ""a sack of double Mac's"" and we were honored to be able to fulfill his request, and you shoulda seen the look at the cashier's face when I ordered 20 double cheeseburgers,naturally without onions of course.We had to get cleaver to find a way to put 20 burgers in our packs, and made our way back to the trail. We put our thumbs up in the air to signal that we were ready to go from from walkers into passengers. Several cars declined to participate and finally one drove by with a dog in the backseat, and I said to Quick that I would been willing to sit next to that dog. A few moments later I hear a lady shouting in our direction, waving, trying to get our attention. It was the driver of the car with the dog...we walk over to her parked car and I realize the car is tiny, and already had two humans and 2 dogs in it...and now Quick and I were going to have to figure out a way to squeeze into the back seat with a large dog, and our packs...the look the dog gave me, when he realized what was happening will live with me forever. The dog instinctively put his head outside of the window to buy some extra room and Quick and I did our best to turn into the clowns at the circus trying to fit into a Yugo. That was the longest 15 mile car ride I have ever taken. Our new friends who gave us the ride were really cool and I enjoyed talking to them on the way back. We posed for a picture with them and headed for the shelter to deliver our surprise burgers.We arrived just in time for dinner and everyone was appreciative of their treat. It really does feel good to practice magic. As the sun was setting, a tourist/ international exchange grad student walks into camp and asks if there was food available. I was kinda taken back by his late arrival, and quickly was concerned that his lack of provisions could lead to trouble and that means paperwork and I know aint nobody got time for that. I gave him some food and advised him that he should make his way back to the parking lot rather fast as it was going to get dark soon.","Mollies Ridge

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525339,"Day 21Gotta get when the getting is good.The weather turned from perfect to foggy with a serious chance of rain. The views were hidden by a monster cloud of grey which is pretty cool as grey is my favorite color. Quick and I paid no mind to the hazardous weather bypass trail and headed for Charlie's Bunion, which is a outcropping of rocks that require a ridge walk to get to. This is a very cool spot and worth the near death experience of climbing out to see, and it makes perfect sense that there is a sign telling parents to closely supervise children here...Since the views were limited by the thick grey fog rolling in, and rather favorable terrain, we were able to make pretty good mileage today. We were set up for success with an easy 10 miles for the following day when snow was being called for.We pulled into the shelter expecting it to be empty and found it packed full of weekend campers providing trail magic. They heard about the Noro scare and came out and cleaned the shelter and privy for all of the thru hikers. I have to admit that this was a very serious act of selflessness and only a truly awesome person would ever consider cleaning a privy for strangers.","Icewater Springs Shelter

AK,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525343,"Day 22So long Smokies!I woke up in a tent that was covered in ice. So basically, I was turned into a hiker popsicle over night. I have to admit trying to pack up an icy tent wasn't too fun, good thing standing bear farm hostel is right around the corner, where I can dry my stuff out. I hiked 10 miles out of the Smokies, which were mostly downhill rather quickly. There is something about getting warm and dry that can motivate you to put the pedal to the metal and get moving. Quick, Coco Ken, and I rented out the cabin and went to work drying our gear out in front of the fireplace. Frozen pizzas don't stand a chance against hungry hikers, and we did our part to devour several of them. It rained pretty much throughout the night and it was neat hearing the rain fall on the tin roof.","Cosby Knob
