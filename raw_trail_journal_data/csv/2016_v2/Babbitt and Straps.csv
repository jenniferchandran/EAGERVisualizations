Babbitt and Straps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547124,"HelloWe are Doug and Jill - or - Babbitt and StrapsIn 2010 we had a house on a couple acres in rural Missouri and one child in high school. We started talking about our dream of walking the entire Appalachian Trail, from GA to ME. We figured we’d wait until our son had graduated high school and was well situated in college.   Soon after the initial planning - - Babbitt was diagnosed with an illness that put all our plans on hold. Up until the last 6 months actually - we figured “hold” was optimistic. We had assumed it could never happen. Only child went off to college, we made a move from MO to NC and Babbitt was told that he had a rare, but fortunate remission and that as long as he stayed on his meds and followed other precautions, he was otherwise fine. SO.... The dream was rekindled and the plans are back in play! Originally we were shooting for March of 2018, but after months of watching youtube videos, enjoying the AT journals, and spending countless hours harassing the experts at REI we have decided to push it UP a bit and will actually put hiking boots to the ground in March of 2017. Despite our age (55-57) we’re in fairly decent physical shape. We both run and participate in other physical endurance challenges. We have many trial runs planned between now and March - to include many winter trips. Our planned start date is Babbitt’s birthday - March 7th. We will climb the 8 miles approach trail to Springer Mountain to celebrate his 56th. :",,Too old to NOT do it,"Aug 28, Sun",0
Babbitt and Straps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547227,"This is Straps... Today we went to REI to take advantage of their 20% sale and pick up a few things we need in order to start getting in longer trial runs this late summer and winter.I hate to sound like an advertisement for REI but it is nice to say ""we're doing an AT thru-hike"" and get an enthusiastic, supportive and what feels like GENUINE excitement for us in return. I realize some of their enthusiasm may be based on the $$ they know we're going to be spending there in the next 6 months but it's still nice to hear a ""wow - that is so awesome"" instead of ""Really? ? How can you afford to do THAT?""

Babbitt and Straps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547735,"So tonight we made arrangements to stay at the Lodge in Amicacola Falls State Park on the 6th of March. Our 21-year old son will drive us down there and spend the night with us for one last ""hurrah"" before we hit the Approach Trail on the 7th. We may talk him into doing the approach trail with us that first day - assuming he can get a shuttle or something back TO Amicacola the next day. Either way it's another step to making this OFFICIAL!  We've got most of our big purchases done.... now it's down to the little things and waiting............",,Another Step,"Sep 03, Sat",0
Babbitt and Straps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548703,"We had our first (of many to come) true backpacking trip since deciding to do the AT.We hiked 13 miles with 75% capacity packs. We did fairly well considering the fact that at least 75% of the trail was at a fairly steep incline. Vegetation and path changed a lot in the course... and a lot of the path was rocky (at one point I asked Babbitt if THIS was what we could expect in Pennsylvania!) We did fairly well on the trip UP but coming down I had a lot of issues with my knee... really wished I'd remembered my brace. But we got through it and camped at a very secluded backpackers only campsite. From 9:00 am until crawling into our tent at 8:00 pm (yes...8:00) - we only saw two other people. One other backpacker coming into the area late afternoon and a park ranger. OBSERVATIONS of note:1) I LOVE my Osprey Backpack. Incredibly comfortable. No issues with it at all.2) Sawyer water filtration system worked great. Had fresh clean, clear water for drinking and cooking dinner and coffee in the morning.3) Babbitt is happy with his ULA CatalystStraps",,"Stone Mt., NC","Sep 14, Wed",0

I was really happy with them. We didn't have full packs (day packs only) but could still really feel the difference using poles, especially going down hill on some real steep inclines.

Babbitt and Straps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550984,"When we first started this journal we were asked to complete a page ""Explain your Trailname"" which we did. I explained that Doug's name Babbitt was based on the title character in one of his favorite Sinclair Lewis novels - -a curmudgeon of sorts with a bit of an attitude. My name was actually given to me years ago (in the mid 70s) when I was on an American Youth Hostel bike trip with about 9 other teens. They gave me the name Sparky because they said I had a positive attitude and didn't seem to let any drama get me down. Doug and I thought the name was fitting still. However - - soon after we started really hitting the trails I realized I wasn't a Sparky. In the summer between 9th and 10th grade? Yes. But now at this age I just don't FEEL Sparky. Recently we went on an overnight where I got to try out my new Osprey back pack (which I LOVE by the way).   The funny thing about it is all the extra straps and hanging clasps. When I lugged it up and over my shoulders for the first time (at about 75% capacity) Doug noticed all the dangling extras and said ""come on Straps - let's get going"". That name - in that instant - felt more real than Sparky ever did. SO it is no longer Babbitt and Sparky but Babbitt and Straps!",,Name Change,"Oct 27, Thu",0

We did NOT go to Uncle Johnny's as planned however as they were booked solid.  We stayed at the Super-8 in town. On the way into town Miss Janet discussed SLACK PACKING, and how in this area it is highly recommended.  Why carry 30 lbs on your back if you don't need to?  The idea behind slack packing is to leave your pack where ever you may be sleeping for the night, get a ride back to the trail and carry nothing but snacks and water.   It is a way to enjoy the hike less the additional weight - - give your body a break without actually losing any mileage.

Babbitt and Straps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564541,"This morning we were taken back to Beauty Spot Gap to hike NOBO with full packs.  I think this could have been a beautiful hike, but the winds were so strong we spent the day struggling to stay upright.  We listened to the sounds of trees swaying in the winds... threatening to come unhinged from their roots or break off mid trunk. Our plan had been to hike MORE than 10 miles, as we were already feeling so far behind our tentative schedule.  However, the forecast later that night was for gusts of 80 mph winds.  We heard from other hikers that a young man had been taken off trail and rushed to the ER when a branch broke off and struck him in the face. We needed to get off trail. We stopped at Greasy Creek Hostel - about .6 miles off trail.  This hostel was very nice.  It was packed.  We ran into many friends who had also sought shelter there from the storm.  Buck and his son Jabba were there along with Huggy Bear, Chips, Nanner, Candy Man, and many others.  There were no bunks available but for $4.50 you could sleep on the floor.   Which many of us did.  ","Beauty Spot Gap

Babbitt and Straps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564543,"This morning we got up and out the door with some of the others.  We'd heard the forecast for SNOW but the sky was blue in the morning and we figured we'd at least get to the shelter at the top of Roan Mt.Roan Mountain is the last elevation we'd climb over 6,000 feet - - the last until we hit the northern states.  The shelter on Roan is also the highest shelter on the trail.  Our goal was to make it at least to the shelter and play it by ear at that point.The climb was nice.  I had downloaded an audio book and for the first time since getting on the trail in Georgia decided to put in my ear buds and enjoy something other than the sounds of the trail.  THIS was surprisingly wonderful - as the book was good and it kept my mind off some of the issues of the climb. That worked until it started sleeting.  Roan Knob Shelter is different in that it has FOUR walls and a door.  It's also got an upstairs loft.By the time we got there the bottom floor was pretty much taken up by hikers - so we climbed the ladder to the loft.  The floor was filthy (mouse droppings, trash left from other hikers) so we pushed this crap aside and put down our sleeping gear.  Snow started to fall and it continued to fall through the night.  It was cold - VERY COLD (low 20s) and sleep was not easy to come by.  The floor of the loft was at a significant slant so I kept waking up and trying to adjust my position so as not to slide into another hiker sleeping near by.","Greasy Creek Hostel

Babbitt and Straps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564546,"Today's entry is the last entry for the Babbitt and Straps Appalachian Adventure.  From now on it is just Babbitt's adventure. We took a zero yesterday at the shelter.  I was unable to get out of my sleeping bag due to fatigue and the fact that I could NOT warm up.  Our boots, socks, gloves, etc were frozen or covered with snow (yes - the ROOF leaked and snow came in on us over night).   I did not want to try to hike to the next shelter until I at least had something dry to put on.Today however the sun came out and the snow was starting to melt.  We figured we'd hike to the Mt. Overlook Shelter (about 7 miles) and decide at that point if we wanted to continue on to the Mt. Harbour B&B/Hiker Hostel in the town of Roan, another 10 miles. However, a fall changed the plans completely.  After almost 400 miles of treacherous climbs and downhill obstacle courses over wet and muddy rocks, after windy ridge walks that challenged our balance and ability to stay upright, after climbs like Jacob's Ladder and White Rock cliffs, in the PARKING LOT of Carver's Gap I took a fall and landed hard on my knees. I am off trail now, typing this on my laptop in my Greensboro, NC living room. My knees are okay (we thought I'd broken a knee cap at first), but I believe the fall was due to extreme fatigue and loss of focus.  I have decided to abandon my plan to thru-hike, and instead support Babbitt from home.   He will continue and I will join him off and on for short hikes.  I will go back to work for at least a year and perhaps return to Carver's Gap NEXT May to resume my hike. I will continue to update this journal for Babbitt....  keep you posted on his journey as he hikes on.    :) ","Roan Knob Shelter
