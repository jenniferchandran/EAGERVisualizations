Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520982,"This is a test entry. Hopefully my technological prowess is up to standard. Still retiring in 11 days. My start date is still March 17th from Springer. Thank you Vince and Maggie for being such wonderful friends and for all of your support. The supper last night was lovely and I look forward to keeping my flask filled with ""WhistlePig"".",,Mt Katahdin,"Feb 11, Thu",0

Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522814,"Well here it is the 7th of March. Epic angst is setting in. The myriad of details are flowing like a river through my mind, relentlessly and unceasingly. I want so bad to be outdoors and walking, especially in this glorious weather. I hope this beautiful weather will hold off till my start date, the 17th. Sir Opie, my loyal traveling companion, is looking around the house at all the stuff with great interest. His interest may wane when he finally has his full weighted pack (about 10lbs) strapped on his back. Up till now I have limited his pack weight to about 6 lbs. He seemed to tolerate that weight very well. I am working hard to limit my pack to under 40 lbs, even lighter if possible. The new Big Agnes tent cut 4 1/2 lbs off from my old shelter. Thank goodness for all the support, both physical and psychological, from family and friends. Could not even contemplate this trek with all of you. Many thanks, and profound gratitude to all of you.",,Mt Katahdin,"Mar 07, Mon",0
Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523162,"Friday March 11th. Lots of angst about preparations. What am I forgetting? Am I over packing/over preparing/ over thinking? Have I properly anticipated my true needs versus wants? Thank you so much Vince and Maggie Garland for letting me put so much food for shipping at your home. You are both the greatest. I am budgeting 3500 to 4000 calories per day, but also trying to keep an eye on nutritional value as well as caloric value. I am grouchy and owly when I am hungry, so I will apologize ahead of time for any shortness of disposition.Looking at the long range weather forecast for starting March 17th at Springer Mt and it looks good. Would be wonderful to have good weather for at least the first few days. Sir Opie's pack has come in fully loaded at 9.3lbs so I made the goal of keeping it under 10lbs. He only weighs 48 lbs and I am using the rule of no more than 20% of body weight for your pack. Now if I can only keep mine under 40lbs, I will be thrilled.",,Mt Katahdin,"Mar 11, Fri",0
Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523924,"3/17/2016First day on the trail. Tired, sore, but happy to be here. Hiked from Springer parking lot to Springer Mt. The trail starts at Springer Mt and goes back through the parking lot onto the trail. Overnighting at Hawk Mt shelter. Shelter is full so using my tent tonight. Sir Opie bunks in with me. Great weather, shorts and long sleeve t-shirt today. Tomorrow the same. Hot meal and coffee for supper. It was a great day. Ridge runner Leigh at Springer Mt, another one, Gus, about 2 miles before the shelter. Love my vitamin ""I""! Total mileage for the day about 9. Sir Opie on outdoor overload. Thank you Vince and Maggie Garland for launching me today!","Springer Mt

Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523925,"3/18/2016Hawk Mt shelter to Gooch Mt shelter. Tougher than I thought. Wanted to go farther but the body was not willing. Great weather, almost too warm. Sir Opie is a great companion but wants to walk much faster than me. Feet are ok, hips/knees/calves are sore. Another vitamin”I”night. Stopped at 1600 today. Started at 0915. Start earlier tomorrow. Trail magic of water today Cooper Gap. Took a ½ hour nap there. Yippee! Lots of fine folks so far, Jim and John from Lima OH, Fred, Zack, Tom from Syracuse. Talked about the Columbia bakery and Hydes hot dogs. Off to filter water, make supper, go to bed.
Tenting next to Pilgrim tonight. He is from Ellington, CT. This is his 3rd attempt at a thru hike. Great to see other ""oldsters"" with grey hair out here. 
Rain possible tonight and tomorrow. Left my rain jacket in the car with Vince and Maggie. Oh well! 
As an addendum - Thank goodness for ridge runners. Gentleman here last night with bad chest pains. He looked about my age and his son was with him. Not sure of the outcome, the ridge runner was on top of it. Heard a very low helicopter in the middle of the night.","Hawk Mt

Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524066,"Camped at Lance Creek tonight. Little rain shower when I first arrived but cleared off. Supposed to be chilly tonight. Big climb tomorrow over Blood Mt to Neil Gap. Small resupply at Neil Gap. Wonderful trail magic and trail Angels at Woody Gap today. Hot dogs all around with cold drinks, brownies, cupcakes,cookies etc. Opie even got two hotdogs. He was thrilled. Camped next to Johnny from Mashpea, MA. Tomorrow is Johnny's birthday, he will be 37. Also Oscar T from Boise. He is 73 and carrying a 62 lb pack. I do not envy him. Fred is still here with the pepperoni sticks taped on his hiking poles. Feeling better today, probably because my food bag is lighter. Calves are very sore, but the rest of the body is adjusting. Hope everyone is well, I am.","Gooch Mt Shelter

Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524221,"Lance Creek to Neels Gap. Big climb over Blood Mountain. Pictures are on top of Blood Mountain. Climb was fine, the descent was treacherous. Had a slight fall, no harm no foul. Thought about spending the night on top of the mountain, but the weather was closing in with snow in the forecast. Elected to continue to Neels Gap, and decided to share a room at a local hotel in Blairsville with Johnny Sheets from Mashpea, MA. Today is also his 37th birthday. He likes the Pats and the Red Sox, heaven knows why. Lovely big eggplant parmesan meal at a nice Italian restaurant. The shower in the hotel was wonderful. Back on the trail tomorrow. Great bunch of folks to walk with. Fred we have trail named ""Trekaroni"" because he has two large pepperoni taped to his walking sticks. Vonnie is from Vermont and Chris from Indiana. Hope everyone is well, I am.","Lance Creek

Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524378,"Longest day yet. Did not leave Neels Gap until about 1030. Glad I bought another jacket. Temp was about 35 and wind was about 30 knots. About a 1/2 inch of snow on the ground. Couple of pretty steep climbs/descents today. The climb at Testnatee Gap about did me in. Thought about stopping at Whitley Gap shelter,, but is about 1.2 miles off the trail. Did not want to have to backtrack tomorrow to get back on the trail. Made Hogpen Gap about 1600 and decided to push onto Low Gap. Had about 4 hours of daylight remaining and enough water to get Opie and I there. We made it in about 1900, both of us ""dog tired"". Filtered water, fed Opie, set up my tent, ate a couple of energy bars for my supper, hung my food bags on the bear cables and am turning in. Goal for tomorrow is Unicoi Gap. Will try to get a shuttle to Helen or Hiawassee and possibly take my first ""zero"" day on Wednesday. Today was hard on the hips and knees and really feeling it tonight. Some vitamin ""I"" and off to slumberland. Temp will be in the mid twenties tonight. Thank goodness for a great sleeping bag.","Neels Gsp

Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524496,"Fairly short day. Did not leave Low Gap until 1100. Delightful wx. High 50's, no wind. The rocks today were vicious. Lots of opportunities to fall, slide, etc. Opie and I made it through with no ill effects. Camped tonight at Blue Mt shelter. Great bunch of folks I am walking with. Mike from Rochester, Tom from Syracuse, Chris from New Albany, Indiana, Miranda from Pittsburgh, TX, Odin (he looks like a Viking) from everywhere. We do not hike together much during the day, but seem to end up in the same places at night. Tomorrow will be very short as I will hike to Unicoi Gap and hitch a ride into Helen, Ga. Already booked a local motel for me and Opie. I need a shower and a laundry. Trying to eat as much as possible, but hard to eat all I need to. Tomorrow night will be pizza (xl) with a beer. Water has not been a problem, just have to filter everything. Very lucky with almost no rain so far. Opie sleeps in the tent with me every night. Great foot warmer. Taking a few pictures but want to caption them before I post them. Starting to get my ""trail legs"" but still sore a lot of the time. Advil rules! Hope everyone there is well and in good spirits. I am.","Low Gap

Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524586,"Very short day. Decided to overnight in Helen, GA. If you take a day off with no hiking, we call that a ""zero"". I hiked a little today so we call that a near zero or ""nero"" for short. Staying tonight at the Helendorf Inn. Lovely place, they take pets, they have a laundry and a large continental breakfast in the AM. Lots of good restaurants here in town for supper including one that advertises ""all you can eat"" a hikers four favorite words. Got a ride from Unicoi Gap down into town from a very nice lady from Brunswick, ME. Her husband is hiking the trail and she meets him every day or two in their VW camper van. Nice setup. Weather has been excellent so far, cold at night, but with Opie sleeping in the tent with me and a good sleeping bag, I am not uncomfortable. I cannot possibly eat enough food so far to keep up with my caloric/nutritional needs, but doing the best I can. I will binge while here in town. Opie has lost weight as well, so trying to pour it to him while we are in town. He is a wonderful friend, but his age in ""dog years"" is half of mine, so I think he is faring better physically. Glad I took a short one today, needed to rest my knees. The hike today was mostly downhill, often steep and very rocky, and that is no comfort to my joints. Already took one hot shower and washed my clothes, twice. They needed it. I only carry one set of hiking clothes and a separate set of sleeping clothes. If my clothes get wet during the day I always want to have a dry set for nightime. I have a long length of orange paracord for a clothes line and other sundry uses. If my hiking clothes are still wet/damp in the morning I wear them anyway. My feet have given me zero trouble and for that I am very grateful. Many of the folks are using tape, foot powder, moleskin, liquid bandage, etc extensively. I have all of those things in my kit but may ditch some of them if my no foot trouble trend continues. Opie is a big hit with folks and I may have to rename him ""Yogi"" (after the bear) as he is always able to con someone out of something to eat. Only about 28 miles left in GA and that will be a big uplifting moment. NC is just as hard, maybe harder, but at least Opie and I will have one state under our belt.Hope all of you are well and in good spirits. Opie and I are.","Blue Mt Shelter

Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525131,"Left Helen this morning about 9. Shuttle driver from Hiawassee named John picked me up and returned me to Unicoi Gap. Weather very pleasant, but threatening this afternoon. Pretty good climb to start the day, but only trying to make Tray Gap Shelter today. I have cut back slightly on water. I was carrying 3 liters for myself and Opie was carrying 1L. I cut back to 2L for me and 1L for him as water has been plentiful along the trail. Opie drinks right from springs and streams when he can. The vet said that would be fine unless the water was particularly nasty. I filter all of my water, as the ravages of water born bacteria would be most unpleasant. The Sawyer Squeeze system has worked well so far. Just remember to ""back flush"" with clean water every day or two. The view from the summit of Rocky Mt were lovely despite some haze, but the wind was starting to freshen and I could see some weather building to the SW. I was able to get decent cell signal (Verizon has been very good the entire way so far) and pulled a a weather report for my general locale. Rain starting about 1600. Time to descend and climb some more. The descent down to Indian Grave Gap was not particularly notable other than the climb that awaited us Tray Mt. I have begun to have very achy knees from the descents, especially where the footing is very narrow and rocky. Opie wants to go a lot faster then I do, do the combination of a rocky descent and him pulling on me keeps me on edge. I have taken two small spills and have no desire to continue that tradition. When we arrived at Tray Gap was very pleasantly surprised to find 4 young people at the gap. They hailed Opie and I, and we walked over to them. They were simply out for a day hike and their car was parked at Indian Grave Gap. I noticed it when we walked through there. They were from Birmingham, AL. The youngest boy was named Mathew and he is 11. Mathew's Mom was there as well, but I confess I cannot remember her name. She did not look old enough to have a child if his age, but at my age everyone looks very young. She explained they home schooled and this was part of there curriculum to explore nature. The other two young people, a young man and woman (Madison and Kerry?) offered me a Snickers bar which I gladly accepted. They then wanted to say a prayer with and for me which I thought was very touching. I offered them some water, but they said they had plenty. Nice young people. Opie was a big hit with them and seems to be with most folks. We still had a bit of a climb and descent to make, so off we went. The weather seemed to be going as forecast and I was determined to get into the shelter before it arrived. I had seen Melanie from Bremerhaven (Capt Ahab) earlier and she was also going to the shelter. The climb up Tray Mt was challenging, but the descent gave me fits and my knees were really starting to ache and swell. Finally made Tray Gap shelter, about an hour before the rain started. Capt Ahab was already there as were two young men who had already strung hammocks in the shelter. Opie and I claimed our spot (our first time using a shelter). We filtered water, ate supper, I took 3 Advil for my achy knees and went to bed by 1800. It was a long night, with wind and rain. Once during the night, Opie and I got up to answer the call of nature. I put on my headlamp, walked into the fog/low clouds for some privacy and was not sure I could find my way back due to the low visibility. Knees still achy, not a great sleeping night. Think we will use the tent from now on.","Unicoi Gap
",Tray Gap Shelter,"Mar 24, Thu",5.90
Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525132,"Got up this morning after a not great night. Do not think I will use a shelter again. I did not have any mouse problems, but some other folks had some small holes chewed in the their bags. Mine seemed OK, probably due to Opie sleeping next to/on me. Decided I needed to eat more in the morning so made two bags of instant cheese grits combined with a Knorr pasta side with cheese. Sounds awful but tasted pretty good. I double rationed Opie as he needs calories as well. We both have lost weight, which I expected, but want to try and stem that trend. My knees are still swollen, the right worse than the left, but not as achy. Thank you Advil. I set a goal of Dicks Creek today, but have a stop short point of Deep Gap shelter. Nice to have that option. The terrain today looked better except for the climb on Kelly Knob which my friend Chris (from Indiana) had texted me was a b----! That was the climb before Deep Gap. I knew we could do OK on the climb, but the descent in the other side was steep and short. We made our miles to Deep Gap, and I felt tired and achy, but no more than normal. I made a quick call to Top of Georgia Hostel near Dick's Creek Gap and they said they had room for Opie and I in an tent area. So I elected to continue as the descent into Duck's Creek was large but over 2 1/2 miles. Pizza awaited us. I was also concerned about the Morganton house as I been unable to check the wifi thermostat for two days. Was not sure I still had power, was the heat off, had someone broken in, etc etc. Never had any of those problems before , but this time of year pipes can still freeze. Opie and I made the long descent into Dick's Creek Gap. We walked about 1/2 mile down the highway to the Top of Georgia Hostel. Chris, Tom and Mike had arrived earlier having stayed at Deep Gap shelter the night before. I bought a new stove, a large pizza, 4 Cokes (I am off the diet style, want the calories), made calls/texts to family. Had a wonderfully long call with Ruth. What fabulous woman she is. Still unable to contact the Morganton house, so made arrangements to travel from Hiawassee to Morganton the next morning. Opie and I have not taken a true zero yet, so this was a good opportunity. My knees are very swollen and achy. Good time to rest them as well. The new small stove I bought is extremely compact, uses canister fuel, and is quite simple. Highly recommended and will save me about a pound in weight. The stove and fuel will both fit inside my small cooking pot with room left over for my ""spork"" and collapsible drinking cup. A much better arrangement. Our tent was set up on a bluff overlooking a busy road. Not a great place to be if you are trying to sleep.","Tray Gap Shelter

Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525134,"Arrived this morning in Morganton. House is fine. Knees are a wreck this morning. Took about an hour to figure out the thermostat problem. Opie walked right in, laid down on his dog bed and took a nap. Unpacked my backpack, put all my clothes in the washer (extra long cycle), took a shower once the water heater kicked in, sat down in my easy chair with a cup of coffee (a large helping of Baileys in it) and put ice packs on both knees.

Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525136,"I have been icing my right knee for two days. I have taken a couple of short walks with Opie including one yesterday to the Dollar Store in Morganton and back. The swelling has not abated and this morning is as bad as ever. I now have pain radiating down my right leg. I had planned to get myself back to some degree of reasonable health, finish at least Georgia and then reevaluate. I don't think now that will be possible without some professional (orthopedic) evaluation and help. I am suspending my hike for now and will be back on line and hopefully on trail after I resolve this issue. I want to thank everyone for their encouragement, their good thoughts and their prayers. Please keep them coming, most especially for all those folks still walking. God Bless all of them and all of you. Rich Umbel","My home in Morganton.

Two Socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526711,"    It has been an interesting 10 days. I made it to Dicks Creek Gap, thought I would take a zero or two to let my knees rest. That has transpired into the left knee responding nicely to ice and rest, but the right knee is still problematic. I saw an orthopedic surgeon last Wednesday, March 30th. He drained what seemed to be a lot of fluid from my right knee, replaced it with anti-inflammatory steroids, and set me up for an MRI last Saturday, April 2nd. I saw the Dr again today, April 6th, and learned I have two meniscus tears. One is fairly significant, the other not as much. I will have arthroscopic surgery next Thursday, April 14th. The recovery time will be about 6-8 weeks. No crutches or knee braces needed, but no strenuous exercise (i.e. AT hiking) either during the recovery. My dream of being a through hiker this year has vanished. I will however, do some additional sections this year. When back in full swing I will attempt Dicks Creek to Fontana Dam. To say that I am disappointed would be vastly understating the case. But as I have learned, it is not important that you fell down, it is important how well you get up. I will finish the AT, but have resigned myself to section hiking, at least for the time being. My wonderful companion, Opie, seems to be anxious to hike again and I look forward to walking again with him.     The Dr did clear me to fly fish again, actually he wants to go as well. I will make my annual trek to Northern Virginia a few days after the surgery and spend time there recuperating with my fiancé', Ruth Nelson. From Northern Virginia I will leave on the 1st of May with my dear friend, Lynn West, heading north to Slate Run, Pa. for our annual CRTB (Cedar Run Trout Bums) convention. We have all fished together for 20+ years and it will be a restive time for me.    I would like to thank everyone for your kind calls, notes, cards, letters of support, etc. Without that emotional/logistical support, none of this would have ever been remotely possible.     I am down for the time being, but I am not out. To all those wonderful people I met on the trail, keep on trucking.     I hope everyone, and their families, are well and enjoying the blessings of a grand life.                                                             Rich ""Two Socks"" Umbel","My home in Hogansville
