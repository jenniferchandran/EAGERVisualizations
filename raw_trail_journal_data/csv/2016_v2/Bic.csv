Bic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521587,"My name is Sarah, but I'm guessing it won't be for long. Trail names are a thing, after all. I'll get to a few details about myself a bit later in the post, but for now...Today is the first day that this decision to hike the A.T. has properly hit me. It's a rainy, cooler day in Georgia, and I suddenly thought, ""I will be sleeping in this quite a bit over the next several months."" (""No pain, no rain, no Maine"" simply has to hold true). Something else I have become increasingly aware of is the fact that I am not alone in this, so that's incredibly encouraging (and concerning sense we all are probably crazy as). 
My relationship with God has challenged and moved me many places, figuratively and literally; this trail is certainly one of those places. My sense of adventure and love for new, difficult situations are definitely appealed to in this, but the most thrilling parts of the journey have to be the anticipated personal growth and connecting with new people along the way. There are a lot of things people accrue from, well, simply living life. Many wonderful, unexpected, overwhelmingly beautiful things, but also things we hold onto with clenched fists and have no clue until they're released. So, to my friends, family, and fellow thru-hikers: Here's to the things we will lose and gain, the hard days and days that blow right on by, the rain and sun, the bitter cold and sweltering heat, the peaks and valleys, embracing solitude and enjoying community, and... the journey!",,The Trail,"Feb 22, Mon",0
Bic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521776,"This morning I woke up to a bright blue sky, and I scoffed silently at everyone who said it was going to storm throughout the day. The Weather Channel has let us all down before after all. So I gathered my pack, brewed a cup of coffee, grabbed some snacks, and began my drive to Amicalola to a trial run of my gear. The storm clouds rolled in, but I carried on... and what a treat it was! I hiked the approach trail from Amicalola to the top of Springer and back again. My shoes were both Christened by the rain and baptized by immersion in puddles of muck, and... my socks were still dry! Friends, this is such good news. It's getting so close to the official take of date. I have scheduled one more overnight test hike, and then the 7th will be here before we know it!",,The Trail,"Feb 24, Wed",0
Bic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521777,"I received a new name today! I'm ""Bic"". As I reached the top of Springer on my trial hike, I ended up chatting to some lads who were beginning the thru-hike. One forgot a pen, so I swiftly drew one out of my pack. His friend had the same dilemma, and as I took another from the top pocket, a slew of pens and pencils fell out. (I have a bit of a problem with writing utensils, there is just something about having the perfect tool for what you're wanting to write or draw).We laughed, and they named me ""Bic"".",,The Trail,"Feb 24, Wed",0
Bic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522416,"What a week! From a trip to Alabama to visit family for the weekend to doing meal prep to getting mail drop boxes in order to my final trial hike, I am feeling ready to go. Food prep has been the biggest source of worry during the preparation for the trail. Finding vegan-friendly food that's nutritious and affordable can be a bit of a chore, but I feel super happy with the decisions made. Shout out to Harmony House Foods for providing some amazing vegetable and protein options! Oats, nuts, and dried fruits are also making an appearance, but that was far easier to gather. Also, who knew about the portion bags from the Kroger ""Home"" Brand (thanks for the find, mom)?! Those things are great. 21 flat rate boxes (which are free to get and fair to ship) from the post office are ready to be stocked and addressed. As for my final trial hike, I just got back! The picture of the trees is from Springer around 1PM when I arrived. It was such a gorgeous day to be out, and I ended up running into quite a few thru-hikers who I'm hoping to see again during the next few months (Rio, Scott, and everyone I walked with for a bit). I ended up hiking a few miles further than everyone (about 15 total from Springer), set up camp, ate, and slept. It's at the sleeping point where I figured out my lack of sleeping pad was a very bad idea. Even though my sleeping bag kept me warm for the most part, the chill from the ground seemed to rush through. By the third time waking up, I looked around my tent and thought of how I could make a make shift pad. Turns out I can fit half my body into my backpack, so that worked out pretty well! This is why we do trial hikes! The sunrise was lovely, the hike back was brilliant (in fact, it seemed way shorter), and the rain held off until I got in the car. Wooh! Anyways, the 7th will be here before we know it. Let's go!",,The Trail,"Mar 03, Thu",0
Bic,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523548,"Ah! It has officially been a week, and I just crossed the 110 mile mark around Winding Stair Gap. My ""average"" in miles is about 14, but I'm getting my trail legs! There are a lot of things I could say about the trail thus far. It's beautiful, fun, challenging at moments, offers the solitude you need to think, the community you appreciate, angels along the way, bluegrass surprises, fires galore, and stories taboot. The common thing I have said to everyone along the way is the need for ""gratitude"" along the way. Within the first 7 days I haven't had one moment of regret or stress or being upset, and I think it may be because I am practicing gratitude as much as I can... in both the big and the small. At the end of the day, we may have a few tough climbs, a couple rough sleeps, and maybe strange encounters along the way, but we get the incredible opportunity to come into the wilderness for 4 to 7 months! Today and everyday, let's take every opportunity to be thankful on and off the trail!","Springer Mountain
