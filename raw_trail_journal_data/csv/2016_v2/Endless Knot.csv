Endless Knot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508586,"Got a good base of gear from 2-3 week mountain climbing background. Planning to hike Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail end of September (when trail running 'season' ends and I have recovered from August 50 miler!)
Main goals - see what is really necessary and what I can do without on what will essentially be a 3 season hike, try out some new gear",,Laurel Highlands Hiking trail,"Aug 04, Tue",0
Endless Knot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/509795,"When making decisions about what 'stuff' I will need; when feeling overwhelmed by all the information, opinions, and choices, I try to remember that it is not gear that will be the overriding key to completing a thru-hike. No doubt it will be ME.Having said that, I really want to use my LHHT 5 day hike to test everything out. So... the decisions continue",,"Oh My, so many geat decisions...","Aug 11, Tue",0
Endless Knot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510467,"I thought I had signed up for a trail run 26.2 Marathon. But... The Call of the Wilds Mountain Marathon is actually a 28 mile hike with an elevation gain on over 6000 feet! It would have taken me 8.5 hours if I hadn't looped on to the 100mile course (taking place on the same day marked in EXACTLY the same way) and gone an extra 9 Miles for a total of 11 hours and 38 miles. I wasn't lost exactly, I just didn't know where I was. Luckily there seems to be magic on all trails. I found a road while on the 'wrong' trail and 2 minutes later a couple stopped in their car to pick me up and drove me 40 minutes to the finish of my run. We did not see another single car or human the whole ride...just good luck or did I somehow clock up some good kharma?? Either way, thank you universe for saving me from a night in the woods, and for the lesson in staying calm under pressure (rattle snakes an all!!)",,"A reality check, but it's all good practice","Aug 18, Tue",0
Endless Knot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512132,"I dreamed about running a 50 mile ultra marathon in January and all the training and hard work came together this past weekend. 11.5 hours and a first place masters trophy to boot!!!!As usual, I am always focused on the next adventure, so... called and reserved camping spots for my 5 night Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail adventure beginning 9/20. Learned that they have a 70 mile ultramarathon on the trail in June ... hmmm, how to start the AT March and be able to run 70 miles in 24 hours or less...oh the tough choices us crazy people have to make!!!!",,LHHT 'booked' and 50 mile trail run done!!!,"Aug 31, Mon",0
Endless Knot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512256,"Knowing I have a plan for ""what's the worst that can happen?"" Gives me the courage to move forward towards big goals.I think the same thought can be either pessimistic or realistic depending on the effect it has on you and only you - does it help you move forward (by facing probable reality) or does it make you doubt your ability and erode your confidence (pessimisticly).What does this have to do with hiking the AT? Good question ... maybe nothing except I know that when I plan for the worst I feel stronger and more confident that I am prepared. I feel almost unstoppable because I have an action plan to work through the things that scare me the most and therefore have the potential to derail me on the path to reaching my crazy goals!!!I don't worry anymore witH wishing I could always look on the bright side and be the eternal optimist - facing my ""what's the worst that could happen"" thoughts exposes my fears for what they are and shows me unequivocally that moving toward a goal is choosing to act (ie doing something) rather than being ambushed by a negative thought.",,Pessimist or Realist - what's in a label?,"Sep 01, Tue",0
