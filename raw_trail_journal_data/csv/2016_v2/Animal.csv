Animal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551958,"It's that time again! Time for another AT section hike. This will be a short one. Joining me are first time backpackers Joe & Jonathan (trail names TBD). Still holding out hope that Tyler (veteran backpacker) will be able to break away from work and join us. Current plan is to hike from Carver's Gap to Erwin,TN which is a short section that I skipped in previous section hikes. 
Completing this planned section will add 36.1 miles of trail to my AT section hiking total. It fills in my trail map from Nantahala River,NC to Trout Creek,VA for a total of 556.8 miles completed of the 2,189 miles (as of 2016). That's just over 25% of the trail! A long way to go but enjoying journey. 
This Summer/Fall has been incredibly dry but we're getting some much needed rain this week. Hopefully it will replenish the water supplies and put an end to these insane wild fires. Gatlinburg was evacuated last night and the entire GSMNP is closed this morning. Reports are not good! Hope everyone stays safe.
Stay tuned for updates on our trip and I hope to post from the trail each night. Thanks for checking in. Don't forget to sign the guest book!","

Animal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552042,We met at 10:30 this morning to pack and load up. Left the house (Knoxville) by 11:30 headed for Erwin. Made a couple of stops along the way including lunch. Bought an extra sandwich to pack in for supper tonight. Arrived at Uncle Johnny's Hostel by 2:15. Our shuttle driver (Tom) arrived shortly after and escorted us to the trailhead. Shared the ride with a SOBO through hiker named Half Fool. The wind was blowing pretty hard and it was cold so we didn't spend much time standing around. The trail was well maintained with a slight incline most of the way. The rain seems to have replenished the springs/water sources which is good. Made it to the shelter just before dark. Roan High Knob is a four sided shelter with a loft. We climbed up in the loft and setup for the night. Glad to be out of the wind tonight. It is howling and the temperature is dropping. Down to 25 degrees so far. A warm beverage and a sandwich hit the spot. Hunkered down in our sleeping bags and enjoying good conversation. Hoping for a good night's sleep and sunshine tomorrow.,"Carvers Gap

Animal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552127,"This morning started off early. Jon and Joe were stirring before daylight. It was cold! Still in the low 20's according to my thermometer. A row of frost had fallen on the floor below the ridge line. Most likely from our breath but a large portion of it fell into Joe's boots. Great start to the day! We managed to heat water for breakfast from the comfort of our sleeping bags and stayed warm while we ate and discussed the days events. We packed up as the sun began to rise and said goodbye to our shelter mates. We hit the trail by 8 o'clock and made our way up to Roan Mountain. It was a beautiful view with frost everywhere and fog rolling in as we stood and watched at the site of the old Cloudland Hotel. As we continued to hike the fog lifted but the wind continued to blow...this was going to be a cold day. We stopped at Clyde Smith shelter for lunch. A very nice shelter oriented to face the sun. A great place to stop. We needed water so I went down to the spring to check but unfortunately there was no water. This has been an issue on the trip so far with most of the springs being dry along the way. Hoping to find water later today. Jonathan and I ate lunch and dried out are things while waiting for Joe to catch up. He was about 40 minutes behind us. When he arrived we began discussing the remaining hike and Joe admitted that he was probably going to ditch at the next road crossing. It would be about 6 more miles. A large portion of which would be up hill. We managed to have enough phone signal and called in a shuttle for Joe. They would meet him at Iron Mnt Gap at 6pm. Time to get going. We adjusted packs and swapped gear then headed out. Jon and I moved quickly in an attempt to make the next shelter before dark. Along the way, Jon began discussing the idea of staying behind as well. Just before reaching the road we came across a zip lock bag with my name written inside. My friend Jason had left us some trail magic (snacks and goodies) by the road. What an awesome surprise! At the road Jon and I divided gear and I set off for Cherry Gap shelter. I left him about 5 o'clock with only three miles left. The sun set quickly and the last two miles of my hike were by headlamp. Cherry Gap is a 3 sided concrete block shelter. Not nearly as nice as the cabin shelter we stayed in last night. The wind is blowing hard and the Open side of the shelter doesn't provide a lot of protection. After laying in my sleeping back for a while and not staying warm I finally remembered that I had a large piece of Tyvek (carried as my tent footprint) which I wrapped around my sleeping bag and tucked under the sleeping pad. This worked amazingly well to stop the wind and I warmed up immediately. Hoping for a good nights rest and enjoyable hike tomorrow. Praying that Jon and Joe made it out safely and are warming themselves beside a fire after having had a shower. First goal tomorrow morning is to find water. I'm down to half a liter. Didn't feel like searching for water in the dark tonight so I just snacked.","Roan High Knob Shelter

Animal,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552129,"The wind finally died down after midnight and I slept hard. Woke up before sunrise this morning. Temps in the low 30's. Wrapped the little water I had with a jacket last night to keep it from freezing. The sun seemed to be taking it's sweet time coming up but when I finally poked my head out of the shelter I realized it was overcast AND foggy. Got packed up and went to find the spring. Thankfully it was flowing! I boiled water for breakfast while filtering enough for the rest of the day. Been having issues with our drinking tubes freezing up so I added 1/2 liter of hot water to my platypus which kept it warm until the temps rose above freezing. Packed up my things and took off. The day started with tough climb through the fog up to Unaka Mountain. The top was covered with pine/fir trees which was very beautiful but a big change from the miles of leafless hardwoods we'd been hiking through. Heading down the mountain I came to a gravel road where a pickup truck stopped to warn me that ""they were running bears today on both sides of the mountain"". I'd been hearing dogs bark but didn't put it together. I left that conversation thinking it might increase my chances of seeing a bear but I never did. Saw a lot of trucks and hunters but no bears. The only wildlife I saw all day were birds. Met one couple (and their dog) day hiking but saw no other backpackers or hikers all day. Very quiet on the trail. The fog finally lifted but the sun rarely peaked through the clouds. Overcast and chilly all day. Crossed over Beauty Spot around midday with a great view. The fog was settled in the valleys (my phone was dead so I pulled the attached image from the web). The remaining hike was almost entirely down hill so I made good time. Crossed the railroad tracks and rolled into Erwin to see Jon and Joe sitting in the truck at parking lot waiting for me. Glad to see them! Handed my pack off and did the last of the section without it. We quickly loaded up and headed home. Another section hike complete!","Cherry Gap Shelter
