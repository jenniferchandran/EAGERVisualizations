Wanda ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522415,"I'm back or will be in a few weeks. Had to get off the trail last year close to Franklin, NC because of an ankle injury which I later found out was a sprain. Took 3 months to recover from that injury and in the meantime there was a death in the family and I spent the rest of the summer helping get legal stuff sorted out. I'm starting around Harper's Ferry this year and hiking north. Hope to flip flop and complete the rest of the trail this year. I'm busy dehydrating a little and organizing. It's really nice to have all the equipment already, just a few things to buy.Getting excited and ready to go!!!!","

Spent the day trying to get finances arranged so bills will be paid while I'm hiking. I remember the stress of making all those equipment decisions last year.

It was a gorgeous sunny day. I carried 18 lbs and was only a little tired at the end. Then we hiked at Ft Harrison SP for almost 4 miles a week later and had 25 lbs in my pack that day. That was a good hike also. Time is passing so quickly and I still don""t have all the drop boxes done. Better get to it...","

Judo, thanks for all the great tps and logistical help.Then Mom, Brenda and I hit the trail for a short day hike. We did the towpath between Harper's Ferry and Weaverton Rd. It was hot...got up to 76. So I have the first 2.9 mi done. (of course it was actually 5.8 mi because we had to go out and back). Treated ourselves to ice cream afterward. It was a good day!

Made a stop at Walmart for some stomach medicine then to the drop off point at Weaverton Rd. Said my goodbyes to Mom and Brenda. There""s no way u can do this hike or even prepare for it without lots of support from family and friends.   Thanks so much to each of you!!I started hiking at 9:30--it was still very windy and cold. The first stop was Weaverton Cliffs. A little bit of a climb to get there but worth it. Met lots of. day hikers and section hikers headng south to Harper's Ferry. They said they""d had a rough nite with the wind storm. The Garvey Shelter was packed and lots of people in tents. There was a group of Boy Scouts heading home and a father-daughter duo practicing for her thru hike. She""s starting in GA in a couple of wks.Had lunch at Ed Garvey shelter...nice shelter w/ a loft.

What a day...Hiked out of the shelter around 9:30 and it was already in the upper 50s so got rid of the jacket I wore all day yesterday. Didn't see a hiker until after lunch. A couple of people out for a hike with their dogs. Everyone has gone back to work and school after spring break.Started raining around 1:00 so I hiked for 30 mins to Rocky Run shelter. A father and 2 boys were there eating. They were out for a few days snd staying at a cabin tonite on their way to Harper's Ferry. Also met Jaywalker who started in January in GA and plans to summit in ME in early June. It stopped raining so I started hiking again. Only made it 5 mins and it started raining again. It stopped around 4:30 and I hiked on to Dahlgren Backpacker's Campground. The sun came out but I was still concerned about tenting it because they were predicting lows in the 20s and windy. I called the motel up the road and they""re closed on Mon. So I pitched my tent and pulled everything out for dinner. Just as I did that the dark clouds rolled in so I moved everything to my tent vestibule, lit my stove and boiled some water. When I poured it in the freezer bag it started leaking so I moved it out of the tent and started some more water. Reached around to the end of the tent to get a baggie to put the leaking one in and turned back around to discover the wind had blown the tent flap and.the stove had burnt a hole in it. What a nite!So now I sit in the campground bathroom typing this entry. I've been here since 3:30am and it's now 6:05am. No, the tent hole didn't send me here, the cold and wind and snow flurries did. I patched the tent hole. It was on the fly so no biggie. I couldn't get watm and the wind was howling so I decided to come to the bathroom. When I opened the tent flap it was flurrying. This place isn't heated but at least it's out of the wind. Waiting for a new day to start.Thanks Kevin for helping me on the internet and thanks Yvonne for the baklava(?) neck gaitor.","

Walked thru Washington Monument State Park where the first ""Washington Monument "" is located. The monument itself was closed due to a lightning strike.It was a hard day until about 4:30. I had just walked across the I-70 footbridge where the truckers honk their horns to say hi.   Beside me appeared a woman (Sandy who had brought her husband Doug to start his thru hike) and a beautiful collie. We had met on Sunday and we talked and hiked. We started up a big hill and I complained ""Where is that shelter?""   Sandy said it's back there a ways. I had missed it. I just stopped . I was so tired.   Sandy said they were staying at a clean inexpensive motel and she would give me a ride. I didn't hesitate, so we waited for Sticks( Doug) and went 12 miles to the Knight's Inn close to Harper's Ferry. Sandy is a Trail Angel for sure.

Started out easy then started climbing and lots of rocks. Met Mosey who started in GA on Jan 18 and plans to finish first part of June. Interesting, laidback guy with abundant knowledge of edible plants. Showed me wild mustard greens. Also connected him with Sandy so he could get a ride to resupply. Passed lots of people out for the day and a Boy Scout Troop. Passed by Annapolis Rocks with beautiful views. Sandy and Doug picked me up and we went back to the motel. Still getting very cold at nite. I switched rooms and was toasty warm.   Amazing how we take heat for granted.

Both managers in these motels are very hiker friendly and accommodating. Went to the post office to pick up my drop box. Used this day to visit Gettysburg with Sandy and Sticks.

Walked across Little Antietam Creek with my pack on but when I went back to get water and while trying to avoid newspapers and trash in the water my foot slipped off a rock and one whole side of my boot was wet. My sock didn't get too wet so I just kept on hiking. I don't know why people think it's no big deal to leave trash in the woods.Got to the next shelter around 1:00 where I'd planned to stay the nite and it was cold and windy and way too early to stop hiking. The next shelter was too far for me to get to and it was supposed to snow so I keep on hiking while trying to figure out what to do.Leapfrogged with Jot and Huck most of the afternoon. We all crossed the Mason Dixon line just past Pen Mar park and we were done with Maryland and into PA (one state down and GA last year so 12 more to go). Kept hiking and finally got off the trail and started walking on a deserted road. A nice man, Larry, offered me a ride and I hopped in his pickup. This was a big step for me because it's been years since I've hitched a ride and never by myself.   Larry is a true Trail Angel. He brought me all the way back to the motel in Waynesboro. He also offered to take me back up the mountain in the morning to where I got off the trail. Thanks Larry!! nother nite in a motel.

Usually takes 4-7 months and you walk approximately 5 million steps. Approximately 1/4 of the hikers are female.

Went back to look before we left but couldn't find it. Started on the trail at 11:00 because I was the last drop off. Trail was busy -- mostly dayhikers. Talked with a couple from the Cincy area who were out with their 3 kids. The parents had done the AT in '94 and were passing on their love for hiking to their children.Ate lunch at Deer Lick Shelter where I met ""Just a Few More"" from Detroit, MI. He had planned to stop there but decided to hike on to Tumbling Run with me. As he passed me I though he smelled really good for someone who'd been hiking for a few days and then he was far ahead of me. I still smelled that nice odor but couldn't figure out where it was coming from because none of the flowers or trees were blooming. Further up the trail I touched the side of my shorts and there were wet but I figured I'd gotten snow on my pack and it rubbed off on my shorts when I put it on. Kept hiking but again touched my shorts -- they were soaked. Finally figured out what had happened -- my hand sanitizer on my pack belt had lost its cap and all the liquid poured out onto my shorts...what's what I'd smelled. Thank goodness that stuff evaporates quickly and doesn't stain.Stayed at Tumbling Run Shelter with New Hampshire and Just a few More. Nice evening and nice company. The privy here is like the Taj Mahal of privies. It even had a door bell (which didn't work). Slept cold again except for my feet which Rambunny told me to put in plastic store sacks.

Only saw one other hiker today and I thought he was coming to Rocky Mountain Shelter where I am but I guess he changed his mind. I don't blame him. The shelter is .3 mile off the trail and water is another .2 mile further -- all downhill which means uphill in the morning. I didn't have much choice because the next shelter is too far for me, so I stayed.Couple of lite showers today but it's only supposed to get to 46 tonite.

They are 7th and 8th grade boys from Baltimore, out for 5 days of camping, hiking and rock climbing.Left the shelter around 10 and hiked until lunch in Caledonia SP. Ate by the river and sat in the porch swing right on the bank of the river. Very nice park, but there was a huge uphill hike out -- which the sign said ""most difficult"" for the local hikers. Hiked until 3pm and stopped at Quarry Gap Shelter. It's very nice...the ""innkeeper"" has planted daffocils and potted pansies. It's like walking into a backyard. I'm the only one here agin. It's supposed to get down to 31, so I'm trying different things to stay warm. Hope I'm successful! Met one other hiker today named Mousachi(sp?). He's headed for the hostel tonight.Had a hiker come in the shelter at 9:30 last nite. That's very late for hikers. I could tell it was a man because of the long stride and heavy boots. I couldn't see him because he stayed in the other shelter but he made a lot of noise coming in. I had been really asleep and warm but when he woke me up I started getting cold and didn't get warm the rest of the nite. In the morning I was very quiet because I didn't want to wake him but when I didn't hear any noise from his shelter I peeked in and there was no one there. Don't know when he left or even what he looked like. He may have been the one to leave a Bible and devotional book at the shelter.","Rocky Mountain Shelter

Wanda ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528380,"Had a good hike today. Met Old Tools and Cigar Girl before lunch. They were out for a day hike. They lead hikes for the Road Scholar program so are very familiar with the hiking in that area and in MD. I stopped for lunch at Birch Run Shelter and they were on their way back to their car. They offered me a ride to the hostel which I quickly accepted. So we walked the last 1.5 miles to their car and drove to the hostel. While we were walking I saw the biggest wild turkey I've ever seen but it was too fast for me to get a picture. Thanks Old Tools and Cigar Girl for the ride!! It was about 2pm and the hostel doesn't open for check-in until 5pm, so I just visited the sites at Pine Grove Furnace SP. They used to make iron ore there and have remnants of the furnace. The General Store isn't opening until 4/16 (this is where they have the 1/2 gallon ice cream challenge. If you eat a whole 1/2 gallon of ice cream you get a special spoon. It's a big deal on the AT.) The AT museum was also closed until the weekend.The hostel is very nice. There is a men's and a women's dorm room with bunk beds. Nice to be out of the cold. It is an old house built in 1829 and very pretty inside, they even have a baby grand piano. Did laundry and took a hot shower. I was fortunate to have changed my plans and stay on 4/13 as they were going to be closed to hikers for the next 3 days since they were booked with a Boy Scout group. Cell service was spotty and we had to stand on a stump in the backyard in order to make calls. I needed a ride back to Shippensburg Rd. where I stopped hiking. Made several calls and got prices of $20-35 which I felt was a little steep. A new woman had checked in and when I realized she had a vehicle I asked if she would be able to help me. She (aka Beagle) said of course and problem was solved. Trail Magic again!!","Quarry Gap Shelter

It was a beautiful hike . . . pine needles, fairly level most of the day with only a couple big hills.Met Michelle, an AT Museum volunteer at Toms Run Shelter while having lunch. Before I knew that she volunteered, I expressed disappointment that the AT Museum and the General Store had been closed the day before. She said she would drive over and meet me at the museum and open it so I could visit. She had several chores to do that day, so I told her that was too much trouble so she told me to have Howard (the landscaper) unlock the door for me and I could see the displays. When I got there Howard did unlock the door and I spent about 45 mins. looking at the history of the AT. Michelle stopped in to see if I had been able to get in. Thanks to both Michelle and Howard for their kindness! Both asked me if I'd met the Austrailian hiker that was just ahead of me, which I had not. Howard explained where to look for the campsites just outside the state park since you're not allowed to camp except in the campground inside the park and it costs $21.So filled up with water in the brand new bathroom at the park and started out. Talked with Crystal and Bill who live in the area and she told me to check out Anile's restaurant when I got to Boiling Springs. They also told me about the plants I'd been seeing the last few days . . . they're call skunk cabbage. Big leaved plants that live in moist areas around water.Hiked up to the campsite and found the Austrailian hiker, Noel, already set up in the campsite. Asked him if he minded if I joined him and he said that would be great. We both were ready for some company and good conversation. We had a nice evening just shooting the breeze around the campfire ring (can't build a campfire due to dry conditions). Had him taste my chicken and dressing dehydrated dinner. He was amazed at the detail I'd taken dehydrating the food.Slept cold again . . . can't figure out what to do short of buying a new sleeping bag.","Ironmaster Hostel

Up and down and there was a rock maze a mile in. Had to take off my pack twice because I was afraid if the pack shifted it would bring me down. Got thru it okay. Met lots of day hikers since it was Saturday and a warm day. Met Julia from Mechanicsburg who had many questions for hikers. Also met 2 girls who had just started a flipflop hike at the MD/PA line headed north. Hope to meet up with them again.When I arrived at Boiling Springs I felt so out of place . . . everyone was staring. . . I think they've forgotten what hikers look like since last year. Ran into Jot and Huck from Brooklyn. Haven't seen them in a week. Bought an ice cream cone to cool off since it got over 70 degrees today.Stayed at Allenberry Resort that gives hikers a room for $40. It's a neat property that has changed hands several times in the last century. There used to be a live theatre on site. Was truly a lively place in past years. Now up for sale. . .I hope someone buys it and makes some needed repairs. Did laundry, showered and slept in a soft bed.Still meeting up with Noel in the evenings and we went to Anile's for dinner. Who should walk up to the table but Crystal who I met in Pine Grove Furnace SP. She remembered me when I walked in and offered to take us to the grocery and then back to the Allenberry.

Then boom -- the trail went up 500 feet and into the rocks. These rocks were ankle bangers -- some as small as your fist and others as large as a suitcase. which doesn't sound too bad, but they are at all different angles and some are stationery and others move the moment you step on them. Makes for a long, difficult hike. Guess I'm paying for the few days of hiking on level farmland.Walked 11.3 miles -- longest day yet. Hiked by Hawk Rock -- Yvonne (my sister) and I walked this section several years ago but we had to hike north and then turn around and hike back south to our car. That was a grueling day for us. Hawk Rock didn't seem so spectacular this time. It's got lots of grafitti on it. The view is still pretty, overlooking the Susquehanna River valley. The hike down from Hawk Rock into Duncannon was excruciating. Steps made from natural rock, but all different sizes and pretty steep. But, I hobbled into Duncannon by 4pm.

Took us about 40 minutes one way.When we got back we headed out of Duncannon. Noel insisted on carrying my pack since I helped him with the shuttle run. He was hiking without a pack so reluctantly I agreed. Boy, did he get the raw end of the deal. It was a hard, steep climb out of Duncannon, very tough.Finally made it to the shelter.

This is a large shelter for 16 -- we had 12 that nite. There were several section hikers and some headed to ME. The major problem with this shelter is over 300 steps downhill to water. What a pain after hiking all day. One hiker said he started counting steps on his way up and quit when he hit 400 and still wasn't at the top. I fell on the way down and so did Jot.

Stopped to say hi and let them know I was still hiking. They weren't ready to hike yet so I went on. Stopped around 10:30 and took another Advil. Everyone is passing me as usual. I can't figure out why. I can't hike like everyone else. It's so discouraging. Knee pain lessened in a couple of hours.Stopped for a late lunch around 2pm and talked to 3 guys who were metal detecting on an old coal mining town site. They had lots of questions about hiking the AT. Two of the 3 were out of water and I offered to share what I had. I think that surprised them because I had less than 20oz left. They refused my offer and said they were just out for the day and I would need that water.Terrain is level today and became less rocky after lunch. I'm still having pain and it took 3.5 hours to hike 4.5 miles. and I struggled all the way. There's definitely something wrong. I should have my trail legs by now.Saw a black snake today. Noticed it on the side of the trail as I passed by so I went on past and then looked around to see what it would do. It looked right and left and then slithered across the trail. It was about 3 ft.long.I camped at a campsite just before Rausch Gap Shelter with Roundabout. Nice to have some company at dinner. She's on her way to Maine too.,"Stealth Camp (1166.0)

Figured there would be someone coming out of the shelter later that morning, but they all must have left early because I didn't see anyone until early afternoon. At the gravel road I met a man chaining a bicycle to a tree. Very odd I thought, but he was friendly and offered to help me any way he could. My knee and ankles were so sore and I was hobbling along. He was out scouting for wild turkey. I asked him where the gravel road went in both directions and he confirmed what I'd seen after looking at Roundabout's map. It was 3 miles to the gate where vehicles had to park and the other direction was even further to anything. So I thanked him for the info and hiked on. This area is very scenic with some ascents and a long descent which wasn't great for my knee. When I got to the first road crossing I decided to hitch to town, but I have very little patience standing there with my thumb out so after 15 minutes I moved on. As I hiked a couple from ME came up behind me and asked how my knee was doing. How did they know . . . I'd never seen them before? Turns out the guy with the bicycle told them there was a hiker ahead of them w/ a sore knee. Amazing how news travels up and down the trail.At the second road crossing I stood there for 5 minutes and decided to move on to the last road crossing at Swatara Gap. As I turned to go back into the woods, Al stopped and picked me up. He took me to the Days Inn at Lickdale. Al lives and has a business in the area. Said he loved the people and enjoyed the small town. Thanks Al for being such a great Trail Angel!!I checked in, went across the street for an icy coke and a cheeseburger, fries and a salad from Wendy's. Rested my legs and feet. Later that afternoon did laundry at the motel, showered, got 2 gigantic scoops of ice cream at the KOA General Store and rested some more.

He plans to finish at the end of July.It started sprinkling about an hour after we left and we finally had to put our rain gear on just before it started really raining. About that time we got to the top of Harmon Hill. Couldn't see much of a view. Finally quit raining just as we started down a very steep decline to the road. It took us over an hour to hike .25 miles. The rain had made the rocks and roots very slick so it was slow and tedious. We met Snailblaze on the way down and the 3 of us made it down finally. we met a 73 year old mother and her son on the way down. She has been doing sections of the AT for 20 years and only has 21 miles left to do in VT and all of NH and ME to complete the whole trail. I guess there's hope for Yvonne and I yet!

Only hiked 1.6 miles to the next shelter. We arrived around 3:45. It was nice to have time to pitch our tent, filter water and visit with other hikers before eating dinner. There were several thru hikers(Brawny, Sister and Grandma) here and it was so interesting to hear them talk about their experiences. We're camped by Grandma tonite. While we were eating dinner at the shelter someone walked up and asked who has the orange tent. That is us and he told us a squirrel had just gotten into our pack and ran up the tree with miles We hurried back to our tent and found that I had left the waistbelt picket on Yvonne's pack open and the squirrel had chewed thru a baggie to get at the butterscotch candy. While we were checking to see if it got anything else, something fell out of the tree and almost hit me on the head. I guess the squirrel didn't like butterscotch because it had chewed thru the wrapper and taken a bite and dropped it.

He is called Hoover and is from the Chicago area. As we talked he mentioned that his hammock netting had ripped and asked if we had a sewing kit. I told him he didn't know who he was talking to since Rosie Red works at a theatre making costumes. To make a long story short she spent about an hour that evening sewing up his hammock and helping him reinforce it with duct tape. Boy was he grateful to have it repaired.Came back down and finished setting up camp. We have thru hikers on either side of us. One couple is NOBO and the other is SOBO.

We just missed The Bus (which will take you any where from Killington, the town not the mountain) to the bus station in downtown Rutland for $2. You just flag it down anywhere along Rt 4. So 45 minutes later we flagged it down and as Rosie Red started to get on the bus the driver asked her to wait until the hiker on the bus got off. We were so surprised to see Hoover get off. He'd been in town for the nite and was getting back on the trail. We said a quick hello and got on the bus. We rode to the terminal in Rutland and went to Subway for lunch then to the PO to pick up our dropboxes. Took the local bus to the Day's Inn for the nite. Showered, did laundry, went to the grocery store to pick up some food for dinner and rested our feet.

Just an interesting fact -- when you hike the AT you hike the official miles which are calculated at the top of the journal entries,but you also hike a lot of extra miles off the trail going into town and getting to shelters that are .1 or .2 mile off the trail.

It was hot here today just like everywhere else. Walked down the road to the Nature Gatden Center to buy a fuel cannister. They have an outdoor shower so hikers can rinse off. I opted to skip the shower because there was a worker watering plants nearby and I didn't feel comfortable but I did rinse off my face. The trail crossed the road and went thru some farm pastures. No tree cover and it was incredibly hot. I sure needed that shower later.Fairly flat today going thru Pawling Nature Reserve. Made it to Wiley Shelter by 2:30 so took a break from the heat and stayed put. A summer camp group arrived around dinnertime. They spent a lot of time trying to hang bear bags. They were also interested in my water filter. It was fun showing them how it worked. I didn't find out much about the group except they were 14 yr olds out for a 3 day backpacking trip.

I met a hiker coming toward me with the news that every hiker likes to hear...there's trail magic ahead. So I was on the lookout. When I got to the NY/CT border the trail crossed a road. There was a problem though because there was no blaze or sign telling me which way to go. So I turned left and started walking. Got to a road crossing in about 1/4 mi. I knew that wasn't right because the guide pages didn't show that road. I did find a map in my guide pages that showed walking on the road going to the right so I walked back and found a blaze a little ways beyond where I came out of the woods. Why there wasn't a sign of some sort showing which way to go baffles me. So I'm back on track but I figured I was too late for the trail magic. Not so...a fw minutes later I saw a big yellow sign saying Trail Magic and an arrow pointing to a parking lot. John and James (father & son Trail Angels) had bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches. I'd just eaten breakfast so I drank a cold bottle of water and visited with them for 1/2 hr snd sat in the shade. They were switching over to hamburgers and hot dogs for lunch but I still wasn't hungry but certainly appreciated the ice cold water.Started off again and stopped at Ten Mile Shelter for lunch. Filled up 2 1/2 water containers because it was so hot. Fell today but it was just a hard sitdown and fell backon my pack so no damage done. Had planned on staying the nite here but it was only 1:00 and I didn't want to waste the afternoon. Kept walking by Ten Mile River then the trail changed. It was a tough climb up Schaghticoke Mtn. There was nowhere to camp and the next campsite was 5.5 mi away. I had wondered if there would be anywhere to camp but what I didn'expect was all the streams were dried up. So when I arrived at the campsites the big stream there was also dry. I had a little water left but not enough to cook dinner. So I had peanut butter crackers and dehydrated strawberry applesauce. I was so tired and hot I didn't even care.The most interesting thing about this camp was the privy -- it had no walls. It was just a john sitting in a clearing. I was camped with 2 male hikers and one of them said we needed a warning system. We were all so tired we didn't do that   I never ran into either of them so everything was ok.

Since I hiked 9.5 miles yesterday I planned on only going to the next shelter today and going into Kent tomorrow. There was still the question of where to get water.Started hiking with only 1/2 bottle of water. About 30 minutes after I started I had the hiker's nightmare. I was lost -- well not really lost I just couldn't find the trail. I'd seen the blaze at the top of a rock slab and a trail at the bottom so I went down. The trail crossed several rock slabs and I lost my footing and fell on my knee. Was a soft landing thankfully. Then I crossed a dry creek and the trail disappeared. Actually it could have gone 3 different directions and I checked them all out and each deadended. I went back up the way I came to the last blaze and followed the trail back to the same place. I couldn't figure out why there weren't any blazes so I sat down and considered my options. I figured someone would come along and see what I couldn't. Sat there for 10 mins. or so and decided to leave my pack and go back up to the last blaze again. This time I saw another blaze on a different side of the tree which I took to mean you should turn left. Finally after an hour wasted I knew where to go. I'd done a lot of praying in that hour.A hiker came by just as I knew where to go and I told him what had happened and he said his nightmare had happened in NJ so I felt better that it happens to others.The water situation was serious. That hour had left me with only a few sips in my last bottle so I rationed them for a couple of hrs and then I was out. Not good!! The next creek was dry and I was miserably hot and thirsty. An hour later Thayer Brook was running with lots of water. I chugged a whole bottle in less than 5 minutes. Filled up 2 containers hoping the shelter had water. (I only carried 2 containers because water is so heavy and it's so difficult for me with the extra weight.)Got to the shelter and the water source was dry so I decided to walk the 1.1 mi to town. After a lot of phone calls and trying to find a shuttle I'm sitting in an air conditioned room with as much water as I want. Trail angel Ann from Backcountry Outfitters took me to Cornwall Bridge to The Hitching Post Motel. Kent is an upscale town and they only have B&Bs or pricey hotels. Since I'm alone again I can't split the cost of lodging. Laundry is done and I had a wonderful turkey BLT from the bakery in Kent. There's no ice machine at the motel and they told me to go to the gas staton ""just down the road"". As I was walking Donnie (a guest at the motel) picked me up and took me the rest of the way and brought me back. They only sell bags of ice so Donnie gave me some from his cooler.

Checkout wasn't until 10 so some of the hikers including me waited until the last minute. The rain stopped around 9 but everything was wet. Then after checking out we ended up at the general store to pick up food, etc. I got iced tea and chips, made a call home and walked across the street to a outfitter hoping to replace a tent stake I lost. No luck so I started walking toward the trail. As I was throwing away my iced tea bottle a guy that was pumping gas asked if I needed a ride up the hill to the trailhead. I replied I sure do and he got me to the trail in a couple of minutes. Thank you...the ride was so short I didn't even get his name. So I finally started hiking at 11:30.The trail wasn't too bad, just the usual up and down but I felt good and felt I was making good time when I slipped on a wet rock and landed on my tailbone.

When I finished eating, it had stopped raining and I walked down the street and went to church at the Falls Village Community Church. I'd seen their building yesterday when I was searching for a cell signal. I enjoyed the service and it made me a little homesick because the congregation reminded me of KCC. Everyone was so friendly and they invited me to stay for their coffee hour which was really a pitch-in lunch. The food was delicious and I talked to at least half of the members.

I stopped at the grocery store to pick up a few items. Walked back to the trail .8 mile from town. The trail was wet and all the rocks on the trail were slick. I walked to Brassie Brook shelter and decided to stop for the nite before 2:00 after slipping twice and falling down. The SOBOs at the hostel talked about how steep and rocky the descent from Bear Mtn. would be for us NOBOs. I stopped early to wait for the rocks to dry out and to dry out my equipment from when it got wet Sunday nite.I was the only hiker at the shelter at 9:00 when I went to bed. I think that was due to 2 shelters located within 1.2 miles of each other. So I put my food in the bear box and called it a nite. Around midnite I heard what I thought was a deer eating grass just outside my tent at the end where my head is. I rattled my blowup pillow several times. The noise would stop then start again in a few minutes. I couldn't figure out why the dumb deer didn't go away, so I shined my headlamp in that direction and it still didn't stop. Frustrated I turned around and saw a mouse run across my backpack in my tent. I hate mice and I was all wrapped up in my sleeping bag and my liner so I couldn't move. I shined my light at the little critter and he started running down the side of my tent toward the front door. Of course as mice do, he ran forward and then back so I kept shining my light on his back while trying to unzip the tent door and fight with the sleeping bag and liner. Finally I got the door open and he ran out. By that time I was gulping for air and wide awake. I couldn't figure out how he got in and then I noticed a 1/2 inch diameter hole.

Wanted to get over all three mountains today but doubted I could make it. The first was Bear Mountain. Not bad going up but the SOBOs at the hostel had said the descent for NOBOs was a ""bear"". They were right...it was steep and rocky. At one point I couldn't figure out how to get down the rock face and a hiker coming up said the best way was to sit down and scoot. He was right. So glad I didn't try this yesterday when the rocks were wet and slippery. On my way down where it had become a path again I talked to a group of summer campers on their way up. They already looked exhausted and they hadn't even gotten to the hard part yet. They had gotten soaked by the rain the last couple of days and had spent yesterday at the laundromat drying everything out. I remembered several camping trips as a Girl Scout and with family having to do that.The next hurdle was Race Mountain. The hike up wasn't too bad and after stopping for lunch met Moose Dancer from the hostel. He had stayed in town last night at Maria's and had good things to say about his stay. Maria lets hikers spend the night at her house for $35. Sounded like a nice place. At the top of the mountain the views were beautiful. The trail went along the edge of the mountain for .6 miles so the view of the valley below was spectacular. I even saw a field where they were cutting hay. I was making good time and feeling good. Then it happened-- I fell head first and landed in a heap at the side of the rocky trail. Thankfully I had only scraped my knee, but I was thoroughly shaken up. It took a few minutes for me to get up. Then I cleaned up my scraped knee and kept hiking. There was a campsite .3 off the trail but I decided to push on. I still had one more mountain to get over -- Mt. Everett.Everett wasn't too bad -- the ascent was steep just uphill for about 45 minutes but the descent was more gradual. I was exhausted when I got to the bottom but a trail angel had left big coolers of ice cold water and a cooler full of iced Gatorade in the picnic area. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Thank you Trail Angel!!! As I was sitting at a picnic table cooling off I noticed a hiker being dropped off so I went over to see if the driver was headed back to town. She said yes and she'd be glad to give me a lift. Hooray I could clean up my cut and rest my body. Turns out Sharon was dropping off her son for a hike thru MA. She lives in N.

A nice man picked me up and we found it was less than a mile. The trail started out going along side corn fields and roads. Then it started up June Mountain. About half way up I heard hiking poles so I knew a hiker was coming toward me. I rounded a corner and saw a bear in the middle of the trail. There was a hiker facing me a few yards up the trail with his poles overhead and crossed. I did the same thing and hoped the bear didn't feel cornered. He sat there for a minute then ran a few feet up the hill and turned around and ran back down the hill and turned right into the woods. He wasn't a full grown bear, probably s yearling.

The trail was now just starting up East Mountain. I looked and another bear was beside the trail in front of me. I stopped and raised my poles and tapped them together. The bear ran away from me and sat down next to the trail. He was far enough ahead of me that I took a step and he was startled and ran away. WOW--2 bears in an hour!! It could have been the same one and maybe not. It was exciting either way.After the second bear I saw a 3-foot long snake beside the trail. He didn't move so I had enough time to get a picture.    I'll have to figure out what kind it is.

Drove to Franklin, NC from Chattanooga where my aunt lives. Last year I had to leave the trail at Deep Gap, NC due to an ankle sprain, so I wanted to hike from there to Winding Stair Gap for the next 4 days. Took 3.25 hrs to make the drive and arrived at Franklin at 11:30am. Stopped at Outdoor 76 (local outfitter)for a trail map of Northern Virginia but no luck. Then drove to Pizza Hut to get lunch and pizza to take for dinner on the trail. Drove to Winding Stair Gap and ate half of my pizza and did last minute prep. Susan Allen (shuttle driver who gave me a ride last yr. arrived at 1:30 as arranged). Before she got there I saw a hiker (FIDO)sitting down looking at the guide and dialing his phone. Figured he was trying to get a ride to Franklin and told him I had a shuttle ride coming and he could probably get a ride back to town with her. When she arrived she apologized for being late (which she wasn't) because she had been stopped for a driver license check. I'd never heard of that but she told me they did it quite often in NC. She took FIDO and I to Deep Gap and he realized half way there that he had parked his car at Deep Gap so Susan dropped us both off.
Planned to hike to Standing Indian Shelter which is only a mile in, but since I started at 2:30 I got there at 2:45 so decided to hike on and probably spend the nite at the Standing Indian Mountain summit. Got there by 3:40 and spent a little time enjoying the beautiful view but decided not to stay there because the wind was blowing really hard (probably due to Hurricane Matthew) and it was already cold with the sun shining so I knew it would get in the 40's that nite. The sunset would have been beautiful but the temps and wind worried me so I hiked on. Got to Beech Gap tenting area around 5:30. There was no water in the streams on the way and there was no water in the steam close to the campsites. One other hiker came in and he went to look for water and didn't find any. He only had one sip left so I gave him half of mine. After eating dinner I have only 10 oz. of water left to I'll have to find some first thing in the morning when I start hiking. Ate the other half of pizza for dinner and some GORP. I'm trying sleeping in my wools tonight, but as I sit here writing this, I'm chilly, so I'll have to add another layer.

I had hung a bear bag which I don't usually do so I didn't think it was after my food. Its step was light so figured it wasn't a bear and it didn't skitter like a mouse -- maybe a deer?? Went out to investigate but didn't see anything. This morning heard a wild turkey, so I bet that's what it was. Still slow getting ready in the morning so left around 9:45.Hiked up Mt. Albert first thing. Very steep climb for NOBO's. At one point I was stuck and couldn't figure out how to get up to the next rock -- couldn't go back down because if I moved my feet backwards my pack would definitely pull me backwards and I'd crash down the rocks. Finally I threw my poles up onto the ledge and pushed very hard with my arms until I could pull myself up and get my knees on the next rock. I'd compare climbing up Mt. Albert with climbing to the summit of Killington peak in VT. Hiking down Mt. Albert was a cinch . . . just a moderate downhill trail. So if you want the easier route, go SOBO over Mt. Albert. The descent probably won't be easy, but it beats ascending from the south. Went up in the fire tower and the view was wonderful -- mountains in 360 degrees.Ate lunch at Long Branch Shelter and the creek had a pipe so getting water was easy. Filled up with enough for the rest of the day, tonite and tomorrow morning. Never know when you'll find water these days. It was only 2:45 so moved on even though this was a new, very nice shelter. Planned to spend the nite at Rock Gap Shelter, but it gave me the creeps when I arrived and no one else was there. It had plenty of bugs and was an old, old shelter. I was tired and it would get dark in a couple of hours, what should I do? I remembered to follow my gut and not stay there, so at 4:45 I started out for Winding Stair Gap where the car was parked. Had a good sized uphill to do and was worried about doing the miles (3.8) before dark when I was already very tired. Went .1 mile to Rock Gap parking lot and decided to spend the nite at Standing Indian Campground which was an almost 2.0 mile roadwalk. I called the manager and she was very nice and told me to come on down (the roadwalk was all downhill). I had gone almost 1.5 miles when another hiker stopped his truck and picked me up and took me the rest of the way. He was going further up the road to another parking lot. Trail magic again! As I walked toward the campsites another hiker (Lone Ranger) asked how long it had been since I'd had a hot meal. I explained that I'd only been out for 3 days and thanked him but I needed to get set up because it was going to get dark soon. As I was setting up he brought me a bundle of wood and started a good fire for me, then brought me 1/2 of a baked potato. How thoughtful!!! Seems he's stuck here until his dropbox and new bank card arrives, so I gave him most of my hiking food since I was finishing this part of my hike tomorrow.Very tired today (I think I said that previously) since I'd hiked over 10 miles total. Weird being in a regular campground, having running water and flush toilets. Don't have some of the things you need when you're car camping . . . lawn chairs, towels, etc., luxuries we can't carry on the trail. Met several very nice people -- everyone was friendly and offered any help they could give.","Betty Creek Gap Campsites

Slept well last nite with 3 layers of clothes and the emergency blanket. The condensation from the e-blanket made my sleeping bag very damp and we got a heavy dew so the tent was damp too. Since this is my last day hiking this trip, I'll just dry them out when I get home. Talked to 2 guys who are members of a truck camping club. I eventually want to tour the country in some kind of RV so they provided helpful info for that. One of the hosts at the campground told me he wanted to come pick me up at the parking lot last nite because he knew how worried I was about getting there before dark, but was advised he shouldn't because of liability issues. He was very apologetic. Too bad we have to worry about that.Walked the 2 miles uphill on the road back to the trail. Got there around 10:15. As I started, I was so glad I didn't attempt this section late yesterday. Was a long uphill which wasn't too bad today but my legs and energy level weren't up to it yesterday. Had a nice hike back to the car, talking to several day hikers -- one training for Kilimanjaro and one couple training for a thru hike. Truly enjoyed talking with these hikers and comparing hiking experiences. Let me say again that the best thing about the trail is the people you meet!!!This was a good section hike. Great weather (no rain) and the trees were starting to turn -- red, yellow with lots of green still. Only 2 blisters, one on each heel. Best thing -- no falls!! Ready for another section hike -- in northern Virginia next week.","Rock Gap Parking Lot - Standing Indian Camp

Yesterday was a travel day, driving from IN to Front Royal, VA. It was a long day's drive and we stayed at Mtn. Home Hostel in Front Royal last nite. I'm hiking this section with my friend Pam and we'll be slackpacking (not carrying full packs) and using Pam's vehicle to aid us in getting around. Scott, one of the hostel owners, helped us fine tune our plans for the hiking days. We ate dinner at Main Street Mill in Front Royal . . . good food.
This morning we had eggs, toast and fruit for breakfast at the hostel. Nina, our shuttle driver, picked us up at 9:30 and we were hiking southbound from VA55, Manassas Gap parking lot by 10:00. We had a 700 ft. ascent the first thing and the temp was going up already. We stopped at Denton Shelter (very nice shelter) and cooled off with water from the outdoor shower. We would have eaten lunch there but hundreds of stinkbugs were all over the shelter. YUCK! So we hiked on and stopped at Mosby Campsite and had lunch.
Trail was up and down from here and the last .5 to 1.0 mile there was a high fence close to the trail with signs ""Employees Only"" but no signs telling us what was behind the fence. Found out later that some of this land was used for treating animals from the National Zoo in Washington,DC and I think some of the land was used for Homeland Security. Hiked on to US 522 Front Royal Crossing where we walked .1 mile back to the Mountain Home Hostel for another night. Lisa, Scott's wife, gave us a tour of the neat, old house they're restoring to turn into a B&B. They've done lots of work but still have lots to do. Went to dinner in town, but can't remember the name of the place. Food was just ok so I guess that explains why I can't remember the name.
Last night we were the only ones at the hostel, but tonight 2 couples stayed on the first floor on 2 futons. They weren't hikers and probably didn't know about hiker midnight (9pm). They came in late, around 11pm, and talked loudly until regular midnight. All in all, this hostel is very nice. We had omelets for breakfast and Scott and Lisa are very helpful. This is a good place to stay.","VA 55 at Manassas Gap

Home) and drove into Shenandoah National Park. Hiked 3 miles to Stearn's Farm (old barn). Leaf colors weren't bright but kinda muted with less than half turning. Had lunch at a picnic area then headed out of the park to Skyline Caverns. Very cool cave and we were the only ones on the tour. Drove back into the Park and drove Skyline Drive to Skyline Inn. Stopped and asked if they had a room which they did but it was $209 (1 dbl bed and 1 twin)so we moved on. Drove into Luray outside the park and used a coupon we'd found in a motel magazine for the Best Western for $60. Much better. Next door was an Italian restaurant (Garano's?). Good food, lots of it and not expensive. I recommend both of these if you stop in Luray, VA.","VA 522 Front Royal

I had less than a mile to finish to connect from the AT Conservancy Office to the bridge where I started hiking in April. That's one issue with section hiking, sometimes you end up with tiny sections that you have to finish to make the connection between 2 sections hiked previously. That was the case today. So, we drove to Harpers Ferry and visited the ATC office and picked up a trail map for the northern VA area. Pam and I hiked the blue blazed trail from the ATC office to the AT and took that into town. We passed by Jefferson Rock and had beautiful views of the river. In town we listened to a very informative ranger talk about John Brown. Had a late lunch at a café across the street from the train station and walked around town. Then we walked up the steep hill to the ATC office where we'd left the car. A day hiker from London, England was on the front porch of the office and we offered him a ride to town but he wanted to make some calls first, so we took off. We drove back to Front Royal and stayed at Mtn. Home Hostel again. It was full tonight with hikers (Zapppy Tendril, Pancake and 2 brothers who plan to thru hike next year). We went into town for dinner at Panda Express and sat up until 10:30 talking to the others.","Luray, VA

We hiked south again today. Scott, the owner of Mtn. Home Hostel, advised us to do that so we'd be hiking downhill most of the day instead of uphill. There were a couple of ascents but not too bad. Ate lunch at Manassas Gap shelter. Finished around 3:45. All in all a good hiking day even tho it was warm and humid (83 degrees). This is the last day I'll hike on the AT this year.

Last Saturday nite I was sitting at home and realized I didn't have anything pressing to take care of the next week and the weather was warm in IN so I decided to check the weather in NC and found that it was forecast to be in the 60's in the day and no rain all week. So, I started pulling things out to get ready to leave for the trail on Monday morning. After Mom reassured me she was ok, I shifted in high gear and got packed up. After checking all the fluids in my car, I left at 8:30am Monday. Got to Franklin, NC around 5pm and checked into the Sapphire Inn. This isn't the best motel but it will do for the nite and the office clerk was very friendly and helpful. I had stayed here when I sprained my ankle and again a couple of weeks ago. The main thing -- it is cheap. Section hiking does cost a lot of $$ if you're on and off the trail very much. Went to get pizza for dinner and to take on the trail the next day.
This morning I drove to Winding Stair Gap parking lot and was hiking by 9:30. Before I started 2 female SOBOs - 1 from MO and 1 from NJ walked by on their way to Franklin. When I got on the trail I met Glacier who was also a NOBO section hiker. She explained that glaciers move slow and that was a perfect name for her. Unfortunately, I didn't see her the rest of my trip. Would have been nice to have someone to hike with for a little while. Encountered 2 more male SOBOs and a couple of SOBO day hikers. That was a lot of hikers in a short period of time. Then I climbed 1200 ft. but it was spread over 4.6 miles and it only took me 2 hrs. which is fast for me. I smelled smoke as soon as I got on the trail, but it seemed far away so didn't worry. Ate lunch at the top of Siler Bald. It was a beautiful day and the views were spectacular. No one else around but I spent about an hour relaxing, fixing my ankle blisters and enjoying the views. Soon after I started hiking this morning I heard 2 helicopters flying over...one of them had one of those big buckets under it so I knew there was some kind of fire burning. The mountain gaps were covered in smoke all day.
Starting after lunch with a big descent and then a 1100 ft ascent in 3 miles. Seemed much harder than the one I did this morning. I got water for the evening at a piped spring around 4:45 so that I could stealth camp this evening because the shelter was so far. Started looking for camp sites and checked out a couple of places but wasn't satisfied. Reached at the top of Wayah Bald but it was already chilly and very windy by 6pm when I arrived. Just kept walking and didn't find a spot by dark. I've never hiked in the dark with my headlamp on, but it wasn't too bad. Less than 1/2 hr. later I walked into Wayah Bald Shelter and put my tent up in the dark which I'd never done before either. It's amazing how much light a headlamp can put out. I'm here alone and very tired and sore. Did over 11 miles today!!! Hope I can get a good nite's sleep.","Winding Stair Gap Parking Lot

Wanda ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551256,"Had trouble sleeping last night. The small animals, probably chipmunks, squirrels, etc. were running all night. With so many leaves on the ground they make a lot of noise. Finally took a sleeping pill around midnite and slept for 5 hrs. Woke around 5am and was cold and put on another layer of clothes and went back to sleep. Didn't get up and on the trail until 10:30. Met 8-10 SOBO thru hikers (I've found the SOBO hiker bubble). They are excited because they will finish their thru hike in 7-8 days. I congratulate each and every one of them I meet. They will have walked 1,280 miles and completed their dream in just about a week!!!
Arrived at Cold Spring Shelter for lunch and as I walked in I saw a familiar face and said ""I've met you before"". She didn't remember me and we never figured out where we'd met on the trail before. Her name was Troothpick and I think we met in VT. I'll have to ask Yvonne if she remembers.
Today's mileage in the guidebook doesn't look too bad but it was a hard day for me. Up or down all day, no flat stretches. The topics on the trail are: where is there water? and do you know anything about the fire? We exchange decent water locations and no one has any info about the fire. 2 SOBOs told me about a campsite, it isn't in the guidebook, but is exactly what I needed . . . the first shelter was at 4.8 miles but the next was 10.8 and this campsite is between them, and it's supposed to have water. Water has become very scarce and everyone is concerned about the next water source.
I find the campsite and it does have water, though not running very well but enough to work. However, there's is no level ground here. So I pick the most level spot (it only has about a 5-10 degree slant) and pitch my tent. I moved the tent after I'd completely unpacked and put all my stuff inside, but I'm still not happy with the slant. It's on the most level spot though. It's posted that campfires are not allowed, but nothing is mentioned about backpack stoves, so I start to cook dinner (just boiling water to add to dehydrated food). I sit right next to the stove and don't take my eyes off it until the water boils and I've turned off the flame. I'd hate to be the one to start another fire. I stand up to get something and turn over the water and have to start all over. I'm glad my stove is fast and I have dinner without incident.
Several hikers walk by with headlamps on and I'm half hoping one will stop and camp with me, but no luck. All is quiet and I'm looking forward to a quiet nite. As soon as I get in the tent and into my sleeping bag I realize the slant is going to be a big problem. I keep getting tangled up as my sleeping pad and bag start sliding toward the side of the tent. Finally I take the pad out of the pocket under my sleeping bag and put the bag on top. Then I sleep on the highest side of the pad (1/2 on and 1/2 off) to counter the sliding. It works fairly well. With that solved, the animals start to run . . . and one of them is right next to my tent and won't go away. It sounds like he's licking something and when I get out to check, nothing is there. Of course, by the time I get out of the tent, I've had to unzip 2 zippers and make a lot of noise. He's out there for several hours and I never could figure out what it was . . . don't think it's a mouse, I'm guessing a deer. But I haven't seen any deer the whole time I've been out, so who knows. This is when you need another hiker to see what is there.

Wanda ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551257,"I got up at 6:30 -- yes, 6:30am! I know I have a long, long descent all day and I'm a little concerned. Started hiking the 2200 ft descent by 8:40. The trail is in bad shape -- eroded, leaf covered and very steep. At one point I had to throw my poles down, sit down and scoot. 3 SOBO's were at the bottom and told me to go ahead and come down. I told them I'd rather not because I was going to sit and scoot. They said it would take them a while to come up, but I insisted they do it. They were at the top in 20 seconds. Met more than 10 SOBO's today, including only one female.
Didn't stop for lunch until 3pm because there was no place to stop and sit. Most of the trail was only a little broader than 3 feet and it dropped off on one side and hugged the mountain on the other. Finally I got to the last shelter before the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center) and stopped for pretzels and dried apples. Walked the last mile and arrived at 4:30. I had planned on staying at the last shelter and hiking to the NOC tomorrow morning but just kept going. Tried to call Jimmy, my shuttle driver, to see if he could pick me up tonight instead of tomorrow but he must have been on a run and didn't answer. Rented a bunk in the bunkhouse but by the time I'd done that the restaurant had closed. I was looking forward to real food, but had to eat dehydrated food instead. Jimmy called back and said there were fires everywhere and he would pick me up at 9am tomorrow. He had driven by the lot where my car was parked and said all was OK. I hadn't even thought about my care being affected and didn't realize there was more than one fire.
This bunkhouse is different. My room has 3 sets of bunkbeds...no linens just a mattress and no towels. Had to use my 20x11 camp towel when I took a shower. It worked pretty well. I have the whole room to myself since I'm the only female hiker here. The only bad thing is the bathroom is up 4 flights of stairs outside. I've already climbed them 4 times, so hope I don't have to make many more trips. Give me a big tree!!","Campsite at mile 128.0

Also, the section just south of the Winding Stair Gap parking lot (3 miles) is closed. This is the fire I smelled the first 2 days I was hiking. 
As I was driving back to IN there were several fires that I could see from the road in TN and KY. I also heard there is no water along the trail in GA.
