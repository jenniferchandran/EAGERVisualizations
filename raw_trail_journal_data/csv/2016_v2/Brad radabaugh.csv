Brad radabaugh,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532377,"Thanks to Justin Trenish made it to the top of the mountain. Once you reach the parking lot its a short 1 mils hike to the summit of springer. I met Katie at the top who is also starting her through hike. We met Chris and in the shelter and 2 others were tenting nearby who didn't talk to our group much.We made it to stober Creek shelter which is only 2.5 miles in making it a 4.5 mile day. There is some weather forecasted for tonight so first night on the AT and I cant use my hammock (or I didn't want to set up my raintarp)EveTook longer at the shelter to get used to the night. Trying to do 16 miles tomorrow, my first longer day.","Home

Brad radabaugh,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532378,"Started the day at the shelter and finished at ramrock mountain, located 19 miles into the trail. The view from the campsight is impressive however there is no watersorce. It is about 2 miles to route 60 so I could go farther down but there is more nature and no highway here.Definitely soar from the long first day but took lots of breaks about every hour to talk to people or to ear a snack.I have a growing lost of things I could remove from my bag that will most likely be sent home.My right shoulder hurts and my feet hurt from being walked on so much but they are blister free.The trail is absolutely gorgeous with climbing Sassafras Mt. Being the most difficult. Met alot of people today but most didn't want to move at the same pace. That seems like it will be a reoccurring theme for most of the trail","Springer Mt.
