Teach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522629,"Good news! I got to talk to dad (Teach) yesterday! First impression of our new through hiker: he sounds happier than I've ever heard him before. You can physically feel the weight lifted off his shoulders now that he is actually on the trail. So for any of you that were worried about him, rest assured, he is the happiest of campers. Yesterday, the location update was that he was at a motel type thing in Suches, Georgia. (Pronounced Such-is) He's been hiking with a girl named Sky, who he seems to be having a blast with. She's doing the through hike to pass time while her boyfriend completes firefighter training, (which has given me some ideas...) and it sounds like she's a blast. Teach has met some incredible sounding people so far, including a couple of marines, a father and daughter (I think I heard some sentimentality when he told me that one) and lots of wandering souls. From what I can tell, he fits right in. Yesterday he was looking forward to today as being a long day of hiking over Blood Mountain. Earlier this afternoon he checked in from the top of Blood Mountain, in the oldest hostile on the trail, (If that place could talk...) and ""it's mostly downhill from here"". In case you were wondering, the sense of humor is firmly in tact. But I doubt that'll ever change.Basecamp is doing well, from the many phone calls we've had. She has a furry friend that is keeping her busy, and lots of loved ones making sure she's not going too crazy with all of her new freedom. I'm doing well, aside from occasionally wondering 'where's Waldo now??'.As a final message for today, Teach says thank you to everyone who has already reached out to him, and that he had a great time reading everything last night in a nice stretch of wifi in the motel. As always, keep in touch, I know he misses all of his people. Until next time,Teacher's Aid",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Fri",0
Teach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524579,"Because it has not been possible for Teach to update this journal as he would have liked, I am going to attempt to fill you in on his doings.He is currently entering the Smokey Mountain National Park with 167.3 miles behind him. The trail has offered him great satisfaction and to say that he is having a good time is a huge understatement! He has met many people to travel along with and has made many good friends. He calls them his “trail family”. An example of this was last weekend when he spent time with his new friends at a retreat belonging to friends of one of his trail mates. The owners of the property, who have this place as a get-away, treated all the hikers in the group to a barbecue of steak and potatoes and a warm, sheltered place to sleep. The hikers took a “zero day” (day off) in order to spend a little extra time in this mountain retreat.All in all, Teach is having the time of his life and not minding all the inconveniences. He has yet to see “Yogi or Booboo” and would just as soon not! He’s making up many miles today due to the fact that he tracked right past the place that his last supply box had been sent. He discovered this about six trail miles (30 by road) past the fact. Had to go back to pick it up and is now back with his “trail family”.We hope that he continues to enjoy this adventure as I’m sure he will. Keep on the lookout for more information as he travels along!Basecamp","

Teach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527564,"Hey there everyone,Right now, I am at the Black Bear Resort (Hostel) and it has been raining all morning. I have had a much needed shower and the laundry is in the dryer. My hike is going well and I have now been hiking for more than six weeks. I have hiked in all kinds of weather and I am now putting in 15 - 18 mile days. They say you get your ""hiker legs"" after about six to eight weeks, and I am finding that to be true. What was a huge hill or long day at the beginning is now starting to be much easier. I have lost about 18 pounds so far and I am hoping to not lose any more. I admit that it is nice to have 18 pounds less to take up the hills though. My trail family and I will be in Damascus, VA in just a couple of days, and we will probably take a zero day there. I miss my family and friends in St. Louis very much, but I have to admit that I am having the time of my life. The trail is challenging, but well worth it and I have gotten to see some of the most beautiful places in the world. Just two days ago, I was hiking up the third bald of the day, when I stopped and looked behind me just in time to see a deer run right across the trail behind me. My laundry is probably done, so I will end this here. Hopefully, I will be able to add another entry when I get to Damascus. Take care all and Happy Trails!","

Teach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530614,"It is with very mixed emotions that I write this post. It is hard for me to say this, but I am officially off the trail and will not complete my AT thru-hike this year. After six weeks and roughly 450 miles (8.8 miles of Approach Trail + 436.2 to the Vandeventer Shelter + 4.7 Southbound to get off the trail = 449.7 miles) on the trail, I made the difficult decision to end my journey, go back to St. Louis, and start my next adventure. The reason for this decision, is that my last day on the trail, I could not force myself to eat anything, and I felt very sick and weak as I hiked. I will spare you the details, but will tell you that not only could my body not take in any calories that day, but it had also decided to reject and get rid of what it could of the calories and fluids I had already managed to consume. Suffice it to say, it was not my best day. When I finally reached the Vandeventer Shelter at mile 436.2, I made the difficult decision to hike south 4.7 of the miles I had already hiked, to get back to Wilbur Dam Road so I could get a shuttle, rather than hike the 32.6 miles north to Damascus, VA. Those were some of the most difficult miles I have ever hiked, both physically as well as mentally. The next day, I started to feel a little better. I knew that I would lose some weight, but found out that I had lost more than 25 pounds in the six weeks I had been hiking. My body had burned off my body fat and was starting to eat away my muscle. I knew I would have to figure out how to consume considerably more calories per day, especially protein, if I was going to continue my hike. Since I am allergic to corn, it was nearly impossible for me to resupply at stores and hostels along the way, so I had tried to prepare as much food as possible, with the help of ""Base-camp"" (AKA Mom), before I left. We did a good job and had fun, cooking, dehydrating and packaging everything up. However, it turned out that my mail-drops were not providing nearly enough calories to keep me going. I knew that I would have to stay off the trail long enough to start feeling much better, and I would also have to make some major changes to my daily diet if I was to get back on the trail. At that point, I made the decision to fly back home to St. Louis, eat, eat some more, and try to figure out how to make it all work. While in St. Louis, between feedings, I have considered all of my options, and have decided to consider myself a ""Successful Section-Hiker,"" instead of a ""Failed Thru-hiker,"" and look towards my next adventure. I have already researched and put money down on a motor-home and hope to have it sometime next week. I plan to mount my motorcycle on the back, load it up and drive out to the trail to meet up with my Trail Family and hike with them for at least a few days. From there, I am proud and excited to say that I have no definite plans. Maybe some year in the future, I will go back and complete a thru-hike with a better nutrition plan, but for now, I will focus on my new adventure. I must say in closing, that even though my hike was cut short, it was still six weeks and 450 miles that I will never forget! I have had a ton of exciting events and adventures in my day, but my time on the AT with my Trail Family will always hold a prominent place in my memory! Thank you for following my adventure. If you are interested in following my next adventure, stay tuned. I will post a link on here in the next day or two to the blog I am intending to start. I have no doubt that I will have more than enough fun and excitement during my next adventure to write about.","Appalachian Trail
