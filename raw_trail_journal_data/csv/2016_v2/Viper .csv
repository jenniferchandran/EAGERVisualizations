But my opportunity will be here in 2016. I do foresee issues created by ""A Walk in the Woods."" It'll be interesting to see what happens at the traditional starting locations, Springer, Katahdin, Harper's Ferry. Therefore I'll be arranging a SOBO leapfrog thru-hike.

The hammock wins; the under quilt was also a winner, but weight may change that to a""bubble wrap"" sheet. The dehydrator has arrived, may the sales on veggies and fruit begin. Recipes are already assembled. Spent most of today trying to calculate mail drops. And they aren't as simple to determine as I initially thought. Some mailing addresses, not part offices, won't be open when I first s start, others will be closed at, or toward the end, of my hike. The other notable item: I've checked average weather along my route, it remains relatively constant. There will be a very limited window of switching out to lighter, summer, gear. Basically I'll carry the same great, same weight, throughput the entire hike. And I've done a great check with the""B-man."" He didn't find much unnecessary, removed one fleece layer, and remember to switch to Bic lighters. And a switch from headlamp to a string of mini lights.But Thanksgiving is this week, the family will all be here, and there is much to be thankful for.

In the meantime I've turned the kitchen into a hazard zone, it should have caution flags and flashing lights.   Dehydrator and vacuum sealer cover counter, bags on floor and table. And that doesn't count the large box of gear in the living room. But thankfully my wife has tolerated my current life style. I actually believe she understands this goal (obsession?). I'm ready for the next step. Training starts this week, hopefully I can manage to continue through Christmas. Still pondering mail drops. And thinking of mail, my new ""toy"" arrived, a battery that generates a charge through kinetic energy.

BUT, it would put me at Katahdin on 01 July, with a climb the next day. BUT, somehow I missed the significance of that weekend, oops it's 4th of July. So, back to the drawing board, or in this case, calendar. Stay a week earlier. So far, not a major issue-everything still moving ahead smoothly, food is drying, training continues, and life of the trail goes forward. Plans to step off the grid are slowly taking shape - pay off all credit and debt, pay bills in advance; leave no distractions. In the ""still to do"" column, there's a reunion of sorts in SC first week of April. And with luck a shakedown trip to Harpers Ferry during the ""Flip Flop Kickoff.""

Viper ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528506,"ATC held the Flip Flop Festival this weekend. I'd originally planned to attend as part of a ""shakedown"" hike. But you can't plan for everything. Needed to complete retirement issues on Friday. So... Anyway, did attend the ""festival."" I met a number of the hikers leaving NOBO for the first half of their journey. Few had trail names, in fact I can only remember one, Wolf, whose outstanding characteristic is a 5-pound base weight. He basically carries a daypack. While very small, the festival was very informative. There were presentations on relevant topics, trail ettiquette, hiking the AT, something for everyone, thru or section hiker, or just someone interested in the trail. Most remarkable from the trail ettiquette talk were the facts that apparently hikers are not welcome in laundromats in CT and the ""jail"" hostel closed in PA. I still don't really believe hikers find it acceptable behavior to wear only their underwear while they do laundry. Nor can I truly believe hiker behavior so bad they are no longer welcome in a location that houses persons with bad behavior - how criminal do you have to be to be unwanted in a jail? I realize the ""jail"" was not really used as such, but it does give a different meaning to the term, ""criminal behavior.""Not many vendors. Most likely as a second year effort it hasn't attracted enough attendance to warrant vendors traveling. But those attending I spoke with thought the event worth the time and effort. Maybe it will grow, as well as the number of alternative route hikers.The weather is so nice I almost wished I was leaving with the group. But I completed no shakedown hike. I did get time on the trail and a night out. I also had a pack shakedown on Sunday. Blissful took a long time checking my gear, questioning durability, some selection, and placement in the pack. As the flip flop hikers group had left at 0900, we were able to spend about an hour in discussion. Without a doubt, time well spent. Having accomplished all I think possible in an abbreviated weekend, I've returned home to put the finishing touches on mail drops and equipment.","Harpers Ferry WV

Viper ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529817,"Day 1: So the building at the bottom of this grade was marked ""Greylock Community Club."" Little did I realize I really wasn't hiking up Greylock. With the exeruberance of youth, which I'm not, and pent up energy of months of planning, I started up Phelps Avenue from Route 2.And continued up, and up, and up... It took about half an hour before I heard the group in front and realized that my pace was way too fast for day 1. In fact, it was probably too fast for day 3, 4, 5, or 6. For the next half hour I and the group tried to let me pass; it took all of 30 minutes and 2 attempts. They were all under 21, but a little disfunctional and hiked accordion style. They moved, I stopped, started, and started again. Finally a pace, of sorts,and I finally reach a view where I learn I'd reached Mt. Prospect. On I go thinking that my trail guide, back in Pittsburgh, is probably chuckling about starting me here. Shortly, another view, oops, Mt. Williams. I meet a trail maintenence crew here and realize all the pruning that I had passed. Day 1 and thankful for help already. But on to Mt. Greylock. Not surprisingly the trail goes down before it goes up, and it always goes up. Seemingly, straight up. The views from the summit were worth the climb. I encountered 2 issues on the summit, the wind and the blazes. The wind was so stiff I needed a stop at Thunderbolt Shelter to add clothing. Fortunately someone put it there for me. Then the summit for viewing. After 20 minutes I decided I needed another layer of clothing. Then off down the trail. The blazes, however, took me around the summit to the shelter. I found the missing blaze on the second loop. Obviously the blazes favor the NOBOs. And I've probably given new meaning to the phrase ""9 before 9"" I covered a little over 9 miles before 2100. Actually with just enough time to set up, eat, and get the food bag to the bear box before dark.And the first day is behind me. A chilly night but I'm well-prepared. The memorial was the treat of the day, Thunderbolt Shelter second; reminders of those whose actions allow me the privilege to be here.

Feet must have swelled;I'd bought the boots a full size bigger than normal. I'd worn boots every day for work for over 30 years. I'd worn these every other day for months, even taking them on a shake down hike. No problems - not until today. Up out of the shelter was okay, but the majority of the hike into Cheshire was downhill. And my toes pounded the front of the boots. I'd always believed it was a gradual thing. It's not; toes into front of boot, attempt to alleviate that simply added stress to the knees. Take the stress from the knees with the trekking poles. And I'm really uncomfortable in 5 miles. It's Sunday, a stop at church is in order, but the doors to the house of God are locked. We have a conversation anyway. The boot problem will be fixed tomorrow.","Mark Noepel Shelter

Lincoln, NH, is where they were staying so there too am I. 
Monday is unique but I find boots at Lahouts. Melissa finds a dress pair of boots for herself and we're off to an early dinner which occurs at Schilling in Littleton. Food and brew. Then a stop on the return to see the ""Old Man of the Mountain"" and back to the room.

The weather does get better going south. Snow, then sleet, then hail, then rain. When we arrive in Cheshire a drizzle. Lunch in Cheshire doesn't seem possible, maybe all business is seasonal. It ends as a Dunkin' Donuts coffee and sandwich. I need to get on the trail. The drizzle stops and I repack gear. Surprisingly, or maybe not so, I have difficulty getting everything in the pack.

Maybe there will be a work crew at UGP.Of special note, the only 4-legged animals I've seen have been 1 squirrel and 2 chipmunks. I've probably spooked 4 or 5 grouse and a half dozen hawks. Two of the hawks were real close today riding thermals at Mason Summit. Yesterday either a very large hawk or turkey vulture - all I could see was the shadow while walking out of Dalton.

The Pocket Rocket is at home; remember to have it sent. 9.3 miles to UGP. Passed 4 hikers in pairs this morning. Last pair claimed 02 March start. I met them near County Road Bald Top. Their average daily miles just ""felt"" extraordinary. I calculated it as 26.34 miles per day - every day for 58 days. Well, it would be extraordinary. Passed another 8 hikers today, all NOBO. 
Does anyone hike SOBO? Later I saw very clearly a single SOBO footprint, but only that one. Upper Goose Pond Cabin is a half mile on a side trail. Nice views, pleasant side trail; hope my body remembers this in morning when I have to hike back to the AT.No work crew, no indication anyone is coming this weekend. Thermometer reads 52 F, and a breeze off the pond keeps the chill. Dinner gets burnt, a little; I didn't think I could burn food with the stove I'm using under these conditions, but... The seasoning packet covers the taste of charcoal fairly well. Alone again tonight. Just me and wildlife I haven't seen. I hear them. Tonight owl and coyote. The coyote stops early. If the sound of the owl is any indication of its size I can understand why the coyote became quiet. And maybe that's why I haven't seen a goose. The owl must be the size of a Sikorsky aircraft.Finally sleep. It was overcast when I feel asleep. In the middle of the night I awoke; it took a couple of seconds to orient myself. That huge spotlight... 
The sky had cleared, if only briefly, and the moon was huge. The added effect was the moonlight reflected off the pond. I have a long day planned tomorrow and as soon as the clouds close I force myself back to sleep.","October Mountain Shelter

But I don't have far to go. Melody will be at the trailhead waiting. I meet a section hiker at the older shelter. I've no idea from where he came; I didn't see either person or gear when I retrieved my food bag from the bear box. His story doesn't quite make sense: He over-nighted in Barrington with the thru hikers I met yesterday, spent longer at the hotel and didn't get back to the trailhead until 1 o'clock (my presumption is 1300 hours). The longer trip would have been 4.2 miles... But, he wasn't in that shelter 30 minutes before I left...I hurry off, but not without care; everything is wet and I dislike wet leaves far more than I dislike piles of dry leaves and I'm not fond of those. I make judicious use of trekking poles and take care to assure my footing is solid. But you can't always be... So, a ""rice crispy"" morning; one short slip with my right foot which conveniently kicked out the right pole sent me at 32.2 ft/(sec×sec) toward the pile of sloping rocks. At less than 6 feet it does not take long. Dad always said, ""It's not the fall..., it's the sudden stop."" I remember trying to land on the pack (softer than me and protects the head) and sensing ""snap, crackle, pop."" Now laying on my side I remember a 1st Responder Course I was required for employment. Time for assessment: I can't see blood, or feel warm spots; no pain at head or neck; my toes wiggle, knees, hips, shoulders and elbows move okay. Fingers flex, at least on my left hand; right fingers, hmm, both hands are gloved. Left chest, again, hmm.Off with gloves; little finger is bent at unusual angle; nothing protrudes, angle is at the knuckle; dislocated. I remember that course, oh yes, I can do this (and did). Although it may not have been that course, just something I studied from wilderness medicine or some similar reference material. In any case, it worked quite well. I unbuttoned the shirt for closer inspection - no discoloration, no deformation. Diagnosis: cracked, or bruised. Total time for doctor's visit; less than 10 minutes. I'll take another 20 minutes rest time, just to make sure I didn't mis-diagnose or just miss something. Nothing unusual develops and I'm back hiking. The uphills are a little more difficult closer to the trailhead. I can feel the left side but an ache as opposed to a sharp or stabbing pain. I think I convince Melody that I'm okay.

Viper, yep, I should have slithered down those rocks.No really, from the movie. Viper advises Maverick that a good pilot is called upon to constantly assess his situation, or something similar. Okay, a good hiker must constantly assess...The little finger of my right hand is swollen, not broken - it will go away. My left side is uncomfortable, not painful, not swollen, not deformed, not discolored...The left knee hurts. Again it is not discolored, deformed, or swollen...Assessment: I can walk, therefore I can hike.Do I want to continue? Absolutely! Thus ends this evaluation.

Have I mentioned my support team? They are an awesome group of people who are literally beyond description. My immediate family without question - absolutely - but the extended support...Some of these I know only as my family's friends and yet others apparently extend from there.

Neither are immediate family but feel so in times like these. I don't think I have more than a handful of personal contacts I could rely upon to this extent at moment's notice.

Open all pockets; all contents end in one big pile on the floor. Assign 3 spots for inventory.Pile 1, assigned the sofa. Everything I used every day. Pile 2, assigned floor space near a television.

My next chance will be Kent so I will push for the shelter closest. I have a chat with NOBO thru, Dr. John, who reports the outfitter in Kent had none. At my midmorning stop I call and find that there is alcohol, just not Coleman. A change of plans occurs immediately. Stewart Hollow Shelter is now tonight's destination. I arrive to find a hiker who is from GB, on holiday before starting the PhD program. A very independent youth, a breath of fresh air in the woods. Two other NOBO hikers arrive before dark. They'll hike out together in morning. It is now dark and therefore must be bedtime. 
They however are still up conversing rather loudly. And a fragrant odor, all too familiar, follows the breeze to the river. 
Fortunately I'm really tired or words could be exchanged. Maybe a night's rest will clear my head.","Pine Swamp Brook Shelter

I arrive in ""downtown"" Kent about 1145, to find high school aged students all over. The town surely doesn't look that large. And the combination ice cream shoppe/backcountry outfitter, they're closed until 1300. So I warm my bare feet on asphalt and air out socks. At 1300 things start to gain clarity. The shop owner is willing to answer almost any question. But I solve problems first; alcohol for stove fuel and a replacement beanie. Then lunch and conversation. The town is small; they don't have their own high school; the regional is outside Falls Village. But they do have 3, yes 3, boarding schools. No wonder I was getting that ""I've been here before feeling."" This is where I used to work, too many spoiled little rich kids and their play toys. And Kent is a town where the people seem to hold tightly to their traditional values. Enough of Kent, however and off to Mt. Algo shelter. While setting dinner I hear a splash. The stream isn't big enough to support fish so I look. Shortly I meet ""Tapestry"" who I can only identify as ""bad luck.""Is his first day out on a 4 day hike. He's lost his hat, overestimated his ability for today's distance, underestimated the rocks and elevation changes, and to top everything, he slipped and feel in the brook about a mile before the shelter - all the way in. What I heard was him slip again and step into the stream to maintain balance. Oh, and somewhere he left his glasses. And his watch stopped.I offer him my reading glasses to no avail; he needs 6.5x minimum. He claims he can see to hike. We do get a text sent to his wife. I suggest that he hole out to Kent in the morning with the other hiker in the shelter area, a rookie hiker but nice guy.

I thought I heard an adult female voice and when I get a chance to glance at the back of the shelter there is no mistake in physique, girls.Then the other two members of the shelter are out to assist. No problems; there are more than enough adult males with the scouts to cause these two to return to the shelter. 
Not that it helps me. ""Travelin' Man"" makes telephone calls, plays music for 30 minutes, and just rambles on about anything and everything. This reminds me to ""hang out"" in the hammock in inclement weather. But I do get to sleep at a reasonable hour.

Unfortunately few if any will be outside spectators; most will be family, friends, and others of the profession. It is doubtful my presence, or lack thereof, is ever noted.

In about another hour I catch the 3 adults supervisors for the forward group; 2 guys and the ""required"" lady. They are easy to pass and shortly I overtake the group of 5 ""leaders"" ( 3 girls and 2 boys). We leapfrog briefly; to try to keep in front of this group will exhaust me in short order. I hike behind then until they stop for a break. This is a good idea.The adults eventually arrive and I let the entire group in front to the shelter (about 40 minutes). They set up and have a meal eaten before the other group ever arrives.This is a solid shelter; block structure, windows, and one side even has a real door. There are 3 bunk beds. And you can really call in an order for pizza delivery. ""Smiley"" and ""Bill Bailey"" are both there, older hikers, and we eventually do place an order. They split a very large pizza. I've already had soup, macaroni and cheese with meat and vegetable, and finish with a spinach and cheese calzone for dessert. I think I may still be hungry.There are residences in close proximity and it doesn't take long after the other scout group arrives before the East Fishkill Police stop by. It seems someone has been trespassing and given the property owner a bad time when encountered. Sounds familiar. The scouts are now under close scrutiny. But stove lessons in preparation for Philmont take up spare time.At 1800, thunder and related storms for several hours. Time out to watch the ""show.""At the end of the storm all is now peaceful.

Certainly.The day however apparently had its own agenda. First, it was windy, very windy. Then the temperature seemed to be dropping. And that was before I even left the shelter area.About 15 minutes after leaving the area I meet Gunnar (now trailname, ""Rusty"") NOBO. I had met ""Rusty"" at the Flip Flop Festival in Harpers Ferry about a month ago. At first he didn't recognize me; it took a minute to refresh his memory. I had thought him to be a rather tough German hiker when we first met. His distance after a month confirmed my belief. Apparently his fellow NOBO hikers had tried to name him ""Iron Man"" (more confirmation for my theory) without success. Gunnar said he simply responded that he was ""rusty,"" not iron. He is dressed very warmly even though he reports he has hiked about 6 miles.After going on our respective ways I meet 2 females also NOBO. These are 2 females that have been hiking in the same bubble as ""Rusty."" They are even more warmly dressed, claiming the cold has been following them for the past 2 days. Whatever ""weather"" is following them is what I'm walking toward. They also report Fahnestock State Park has warm showers and poor tent sites for AT hikers.About lunch I get to the boundary of the state park. The temperature has dropped further and the wind increased. I pass another NOBO thru-hiker. We converse in passing; he hurries past reporting he is trying to ""get out of this weather."" My decision now changes. I will be stopping here. I leave the trail and find I've no choice but a road walk . AWOL's guide is not very accurate here. I check the park office to confirm an overnight AT stay. I'm directed to the first 3 spots in the campground.I get the hammock hung and proceed to the shower. The showers are warm, hot even. So warm that turning the water off is not something I really wanted to do. But I do get dried and dressed. And I return to my hammock. On this return I discover I'm on the wrong side of the road, the AT sites are on the opposite side. Poor tent sites, that would almost be an understatement, bad might be more accurate. In addition, there is absolutely no place or way to place a hammock. So my hammock stays where it is. And the wind never eases. I try for a nap. That works for a short time. I awake to someone throwing gravel at my tarp. I look out, under the tarp. No one there. But the gravel is still being flung. Realization sets in; not gravel, hail. Briefly the ground turns that glassy white. It stays briefly, then melts. I return to my nap. Just before dark the hail makes a second appearance, even more briefly.The temperature continues to drop. Cold air just seems to lay atop my quilt waiting for a slight gap so it can seep in and disturb my sleep. It becomes a vicious circle for unknown reasons. I pull one side tighter; the cold air slides under the other side. I pull that side and cold air drifts under another spot of the quilt. Every move on my part is countered by cold drafts.I'm not winning and tomorrow is a zero day. When Melody lets me know the travel time I advise her to pick me up. I start my zero day at 0300. And my equipment exchange will occur Monday.
At about 1100 this morning I encountered a US flag painted on a rock.and I remember that just about now there is a Memorial service. Just like the vigil of 2 nights ago it will be attended primarily by friends, family, and those of the same profession. Few, if any, outsiders will be there. Not much will be newsworthy. But I remember, and honor, although my presence will not be missed here either. I also wonder how those who try to make this profession just a job with benefits can sleep at night.

This way I can maximize time with my wife and continue adding miles. So today, back to Fahnestock State Park. The trail started easy enough; I figured to get maximum miles today. The trail however turned rocky quickly and was covered with a layer of dry brown leaves. The faster I tried to go the quicker I kicked loose rocks, stumbled on hidden rocks, and banged my toes against camouflaged roots and rocks. This was not going as I had envisioned. I then happened across 4 young male adults sitting in the trail. They were out for a short section hike. I determined they had hiked about 3 miles from last night's campsite before needing a serious rest. I had been going pretty strong and was feeling better the more they complained. I continue and stop in another hour for lunch. They wander along just before I finish lunch. I can see the looks at my lunch and then the question: ""What are you eating?"" My response is fairly rapid, ""A stromboli from my hometown pizza shop."" (It was in fact a stromboli from Sam's Pizza Shop.)They stop again for another rest and I'm off. I will not see them again. I call for a ride from the Appalachian Market, US 9 and NY 403.

Specifically the little toe on each foot feels as if someone slammed a trekking pole down on the outside edge of the toe. There is, however, much to be accomplished today. First I need to correct the logistical error. The error: Who seems themselves a package to a location at which they will meet family? Unfortunately I must take credit for that mistake. So off to Ft. Montgomery Post Office. The building is located on Fallen Firefighters Memorial Drive. Package retrieved. On the other hand I'd picked the right location for this resupply; I have only today's lunch and dinner in my pack. I'd given an ETA of 16 May; 2 days behind schedule. Not too bad. Now back to the Appalachian Market. I did try to take care of my foot issues last night and must have accomplished something; it is a little less painful while picking my way through the rocks. I meet ""Orange Crush"" while eating lunch. She is so named due to a bright orange shirt and as, for someone her age, she is ""crushing it"" (the trail). She attacks the slope and I start a road walk on NY 9D.
There are visible blazes on the bridge, but it is the only bridge in vicinity over the Hudson River and I surely wouldn't be able to swim across. 
So, over the river and through the...zoo. Yes, through the zoo. I get an AT paper stamp at the office. I spend too much time wandering through the zoo. Everything has a sign and I read a lot of them. Even the utility pole has a sign. I do eventually wander into the Hiker Cafe at Bear Mountain Inn. Melody arrives and we have those adult beverages. Again we dally longer than I want. 
Finally off with pack and I climb to the top of the mountain and end my day at the top of Perkins' Tower. I save having to carry a full pack to the top tomorrow.

What great views - you can actually see the NYC skyline 34 miles away. Then on West Mountain you can see the skyline one minute from the east side of the ridge and then you're on the west side where there is only green cover visible but the unmistakable sound of small arms fire. I am in the land of military (academy and nearby fort) and I appreciate the sounds as nothing less than comforting; there are those who are ready, willing, and able to defend this country (regardless of what the general public may think, or believe, about military or police).I continue, safe in those sounds, almost until I arrive at the shelter area. I had planned lunch at West Mountain Shelter, with its views of the city skyline, but somehow missed the blue blazed side trail. When I realized I missed it I was almost half way down the mountain. Therefore lunch was in the open woods next to a clear cool spring. On a note related to missing a side trail... Not a day goes by that I don't lose the trail for at least a minute or two. Usually it's simply stopping and finding the next blaze. A compass is mostly useless; trail south could be any of the 4 compass points, or anywhere in between. Sometimes it's looking back over a shoulder for that NOBO blaze and its confirmation. Today I managed to put myself on a completely different trail. Sometimes different trails do overlap. I was going strong, picking my way through the rocks, heads up on those blazes; the trail veers right, then right again. And I'm on an overlap trail, maybe. I go about 75 meters, the trail is fairly smooth. I don't have to chop steps; there are few rocks. Is this the trail? I look over my left shoulder and can see the NOBO blaze. On I go, 100, 200, 300 meters further. My normal pace on level ground is just about a meter. I'm not having difficulty with this stride. Now I'm sure, I am not on the AT. I don't exactly know where I am, but I'm sure where I am not. It is not rocky enough, not undulating enough, does not have enough roots. There are no more white blazes, only small white squares with a red letter ""F."" I reverse direction and in another 15 minutes I find that last white blaze. The tree actually had 3 painted blazes.

There is one other notable item of the past 4 days. The trail follows what might be thought stream beds most of the time and on hill sides it is most obvious. Over the past days I observe most of the rocks in these channels have been the size of golf balls. And those that have not become completely spherical have become very rounded.

However I discovered a guest WiFi so everyone gets a treat; 2 day's of entries tonight. Tomorrow into DWG (Delaware Water Gap), a resupply box, a box of gear, and a zero day coming.","Brink Shelter

While the moon was exceptionally bright, the tent was pitched under a stand of pines which created deep shadow. But I digress...Today seemed like a half day. BoulderDash was ready as planned at 0600. It had trained hard overnight for about an hour, 0330 to 0430 (don't even ask how I became aware of the rain, I usually sleep through everything). For the first hour or so we do what every hiker wants to do at the start off the day - climb. Up rocks. About that time we come upon what could only be described as small tent cities. We later learn St. Bernard's Prep from Newark, NY, sends their students to the AT for an appreciation of the outdoors. Freshmen and transfers start their 5-day stretch on, Sunday; upper classmen start theirs on Monday. This simply means this was their day of escape. These were teenage boys, some in tennis shoes carrying large packs. Basically they just ran downhills. And walked over rocky surfaces like they were sidewalks. BoulderDash tried to keep up for quite a while. Eventually youth exceeded our pace; 3 groups of about 6 each passed us and were not seen again until Kittanty National Park. The effort did pay dividends. We nearly succeeded in a 10 by 10 (10 miles by 10 AM). We arrived at the hostel at 1045.Bed space was claimed. Then a trip to the outfitter for supply boxes. Both of us had resupply sent/delivered to the same location. Then lunch. Wouldn't you know the barbecue was set up in front of the local bakery. Okay, so much for lunch. Then back to the hostel followed by a trip to the post office for me. One postcard, one box of miscellaneous equipment; both shipped. It's then dinner time. Not enough can be said about enough food. Now in to arrange my bed space and repack my backpack. Followed by sleep and it is not even 2000.But the Penguins apparently won last night.

I try not to wear shoes but immediately determine that is not going to work; I dislike the feel of Crocs and don't have camp shoes. BoulderDash's friend, Pap from PA, arrived at 0700, with his driver, Terry.They are from somewhere in the Duncannon area.Then off to breakfast at Apple Pie Café. An omelet, home fries, toast, and coffee actually, will suffice - at least for now. Then back to the hostel to assess food - 6 days to Port Clinton. My breakfast cooking has been altered by BoulderDash's early starts; he nibbles on a combination of Pop Tarts, peanut crackers, and granola bars. I, therefore, keep enough of my packets to allow 6 cooked meals. Then I arrange for a bounce box of excess meals to Duncannon at the post office. (Their AT commemorative stamp now decorates my AT Passport.)This necessitates another trip to the outfitter for purchases to complete breakfast and lunch meals for 6 days. Back to the hostel to recheck calculations. Pap from PA believes he has arranged to slackpack, BoulderDash gets a nap, I get a shower (I'm really impressed, my clothes only smell half as badly now; there are no laundry facilities.)Then, off to an early dinner. We return to the same café. We are seated in short order but after 15 minutes haven't seen the waitress who said she'd be right back. She took an order from the only table in the room which hadn't been served when we were seated. The other 2 have noticed, wait 2 minutes more and we leave. She sees us at the door and says good-bye and nothing more. It's off to the pizza shop which was very good and the service much better. We wait out a short rain shower and return again to the hostel. The slackpack has been arranged. Now we need to repack all unnecessary equipment which will be delivered to Wind Gap.

Items like rain gear, water, food, map, compass, guide, first aid, et al. The rest is shipped; it brings my pack weight to about 6 pounds. It is about 0650. And it is a steady uphill (what else is new?) climb to Kittredge Shelter, about 4.4 miles. Then we are on the ridge; we are also on that for which PA is exactly famous - ROCKS! Big rocks, little rocks, tons of rocks, boxes of rocks, McKees Rocks, even Sto Rox(cks). There are some areas which are smooth and level; these are not remembered, only rocks. Even having to rock-hop and step over, under, around, the lack of a heavy pack leaves us at the trailhead at Wind Gap at 1415. We try to hitch without success, there are 3 of us and it is a holiday weekend. Pap from PA calls for a shuttle which still hasn't arrived after 45 minutes. A nice hiker girl we passed closer to DWG (hiking in opposite directions) returns to her car and offers a ride, Pap from PA had also made a reservation at local lodging, and we are there. 
I'm not going to identify the lodging; the owner couldn't keep a story together for more than 2 sentences. 
The AC broke this morning. One look confirmed it may have been the morning of 29 May, but closer to 2010 than 2016.
I will get you a fan from supply. For hours and as many reminders gets us a fan, brand new in the box, and I need to assemble it. 
I will get you towels and soap. He knows there are 3 of us. There were 2 wash cloths, one bath mat, one hand towel, and a very mushy sliver of soap. He eventually brought enough to account for 2 full sets. Fortunately I did have my own towel. 
I'll reduce the rate. He then charged exactly what he charged the couple next door (they had AC).
There is a sign posted ""Office & Ice"" with an arrow. I try for ice. The response: Go to the beer distributor and buy it. I point out the information on the sign. The new response: The ice machine broke. Show me the ice machine is countered with, I can't, I don't have to. I can't see any ice machine in the area he points. 
I really don't care how much in advertising money, if any, the guide books may be getting from carrying such information - it is definitely a diservice to all of the hikers. 
But we do get an early dinner, dessert, and I get a small grocery trip. 
On a side note, the couple next door is simply in awe of our hikes. He offers a ride in the morning. We obviously accept. 
While on the ice run I notice him in an argument with a Latino from another room. Earlier our neighbor's girlfriend had been complaining about the Latino's advances. She had been in his face; this looked like payback. Our generous neighbor was going to get sucker punched. His girlfriend was trying to get him in the room. We really needed the ride; I couldn't let him get hurt. Between the 2 of us, the Latino is sent away, and the boyfriend is in the room with the door closed.","Church of the Mountain Hostel

Viper ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535783,"Memorial Day, a day for all to remember. But for most it's a day for picnicking, the first unofficial day of summer, maybe watch a parade. In my case,this year I'll miss the fastest parade in history, 20 minutes tops most years. It takes longer to do traffic control for pedestrians going to the VFW than the entirety of the parade. But I was always glad it was held - some would attend and remember why. But today is also BoulderDash's birthday. I almost bought the small cake I saw at the grocery - but didn't think it would have been eaten. I bought 3 bananas instead; they were eaten and enjoyed. We check on our neighbor and find him functioning a full 15 minutes early. We are quickly back at the trailhead and on our way at 0710.Unlike yesterday however, today are packs are fully loaded, and we each carry maximum water rations (PA is notorious for unreliable water sources in June, July, and August).It rained most of last night. It was raining when I was awake at 2210, 0330,and 0440 hours. This will not help the water supply issue but it will make everything very, very wet. I know at some point I had remarked that it felt as if someone had slammed trekking poles on each of my little toes - how true - what an accurate description I provided. Both toes had been doing much better - so much so that I hadn't been noticing any foot issues. This morning I planted the right pole and pushed off. All I felt was the pole sliding down the rock; down the rock to the top of my little toe. The pole just scraped dark green something and continued to slide down the rock - in slow motion. I tried to reduce the force I had applied (everything was in slow motion, surely I could stop, or at least slow this down) without any success. The pole slammed onto the top of that little toe. It didn't even make a sound when the pole struck that toe; but I did. No, not an expletive, not even anything obscene or vulgar; the other 2 knew something had happened. And yes, it was, and is, the same pain. Precisely and exactly the same, so I am assured my description was perfect (now when will this pain go away?). Nothing further remarkable occurs the rest of the day. At least not until the very end of the day. First the end of today's hike was a short rock scramble followed by a very steep rock scramble. And second, we are now camped at the picnic pavilion of a restaurant; we had to walk 0.8 mile to get here - downhill. Tomorrow morning may be interesting since I picked this.","Wind Gap, PA

Viper ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535982,"We are up at 0500, on the road at 0610, and finally on the trail at 0710. There were only 4 cars up the hill in the time it took us to walk to the trailhead. None of them was going to stop and pick up 3 old guys. Two side notes: 1. Pat from PA, is actually Pap from PA. All previous entries have been corrected. He does have a trail name. Item 2: My mileage does not include off-trail miles. For example, yesterday we walked 0.8 miles from the trail to a picnic pavilion. That mileage is not reflected anywhere. I just know that someday I'll add all the side trail and off trail miles to my ""journal."" The original plan was to get to Bake Oven Knob Shelter and assess today's activities. We have to get through Lehigh Gap, which, in the vernacular, ""just ain't easy...""Up, out of Little Gap, it's rocky, across to Palmerton, there are some rocks. Then a smooth hike to the gap. Once there it takes us over 1 1/2 hours to traverse less than 1 1/2 miles. But we finally made it across the bridge. Then, of course, up again, on the other side. The trail continues up for about 3/4 mile; there are a spring and shelter at this point. Pap has been having ""uphill"" problems for the past 2 days. I think it's the distances we're covering plus the pack weight. Sunday we covered distance, but without significant weight. Yesterday and today we've had full packs and are covering more than 15 miles. Though I've seen what is in Pap's pack; there can't be more than 15 or 16 pounds total. We have lunch at the shelter and while I'm out to the privy (there isn't one, I'm just being polite) Pap decides to call the owner of ""Rock&Sole"" for a ride. He claims he will meet us in Port Clinton.
BoulderDash and I continue, there is another 600 get of elevation gain right after we start. Then the ridge - more rocks. We make Bake Oven Knob Shelter by 1430. BoulderDash reports one couple that hiked NOBO by us reported the reliable water at the shelter about 4/10 mile away. This means we could be 1 mile closer to the campsite after one trip for water. 
We therefore continue - and find - more rocks - bigger rocks - climbing rocks - sharper rocks - wobbly rocks. 
After an hour we are still 3 miles from the campsite. We are determined - I know I am, but I'm also out of water and thirsty. 
We persist and BoulderDash probably arrived about 1815; I know I got here about 1830,and he was probably 15 minutes ahead. 
The water is reliable; reported at 0.2 mile west, I count 1100 steps on my return from the bottom of the hill. My strides, even tired and uphill, are longer than a foot each. 
All the chores are completed. Dinner was again good (Pocket Rockets make cooking consistent).

I check his tent, he actually had to set it up last night, and find he's not there. Neither are his water containers, therefore he is on another water run for some reason. But our plan is still Eckville Shelter and we're off at 0645. The day is relatively unremarkable - just another day in Rocksylvania. More big rocks, more wobbly rocks - oh, and something just a little bit different - a woods road, in the game lands. Not for long however, back to rocks. We encounter 2 other SOBO hikers coming from Anderson Shelter. They are firefighters from Powell, MI, (halfway between Detroit and Flint) I believe. Their exit is Port Clinton. They also mention thunderstorms on Friday. This will need evaluation. We follow a long steep downhill for about an hour, then come to a footbridge (we are 0.5 mile from the shelter) and then onto a paved road. I know I saw a paved road listed, Hawk Mountain Road, on which the shelter is situated. I stop to check the map; BoulderDash believes we go further. I walk to the south side of the road and on the south side of the sign payed there I find my confirmation - the word, shelter, vertically with an arrow in the proper direction - signs, as well as blazes, favor the NOBO hiker.This shelter has a caretaker and a bunkhouse; we are here early, I'm bunking in. There is also a shower (solar-heated; read ""cold in 30 seconds""); thank you, I want one of those anyway, and my clothes get rinsed.
Over dinner we discuss options. A check of the forecast (isn't technology wonderful) confirms thunderstorms Friday morning. The obvious choice is to hike into Port Clinton Thursday. If we get there before 1600 BoulderDash gets his package. If later he can still get his package Friday afternoon; the post office is only open afternoon hours during the week. 
This will provide a zero for Friday; I'll try to resupply in Hamburg. But these are plans for another day. Tomorrow's hike requires tonight's sleep.","New Tripoli Campsite

Dessert was Yuenling ice cream and biscotti. Who wouldn't want to stay here? It was raining lightly during our hike but little actually got through the leaves. All in all another uneventful day.

The trail was also a new experience - all the flat areas without rocks were now mud spaces. With all the rain yesterday everything was muddy but the flat spaces became soft black mud. You step and begin to sink, 1/4, 1/2, one inch - then you push to stride forward. But without resistance each stride is that much shorter. You are actually looking for rocks to step on, anything solid. Your trekking poles likewise sink - the last couple of days - under and against rocks. If the poles sink more than 1/4 inch you instinctively pull them and reset them - if not as you step forward you'll leverage them against the rocks. (This is not ""rocks/paper/scissors."" The rocks always win.)I do not want to sound continually negative; it is a challenge daily. But while I probably haven't mentioned it, I have taken time to smell the flowers.

It is a pleasant day, and a pleasant hike - gradual climbs, limited rocks.Yesterday we passed the ""official halfway point."" Today we pass the 2016 halfway point. This is a plaque on a post with the notation that this is halfway 2016. The other notice is fancy, with flags and mileage indicators of 1090.5 in each direction. (That calculates to 2181.0; the last 2 years the trail has been 2189.2 and .1 respectively.) I take a photo of New Hampshire Bob with his camera. I took 2; he didn't like either and sort of demanded I take them again. (I may never offer to do this again, for anyone.)We're at Birch Run before noon. Jim is there, rambling on about the trail. We have lunch and move on to the PATC cabin where AWOL has camping marked - plus 2.5 miles. The cabin is posted no camping nearby. We get water from the spring and make a step 1/2 mile climb to a dry campsite. But we are there and set up by 1700. A nap and dinner are the schedule. After dinner I break the branch I'd selected to hang the bear bag. Annoying! Meredith thinks we will be in Caledonia State Park tomorrow; I know there are 2 step rocky declines tomorrow. But now - sleep.","Tom's Run Shelter

Dinner might prove an issue. There are, in fact, a couple of steep, scree-laden, ""ankle twister"" descents today. These are not a favorite of ""Jamie"" who would rather have inclines. It is only 6.8 miles into the park; 7.2 miles to US 30, my goal for today.I completely miss the mark for lunch and even now I'm kicking myself in the butt for this one. I'd planned Quarry Gap Shelter for lunch; I should have sick t to the plan. Instead, I'd misjudged the distance and stopped 5 minutes short when I saw all the rocks in the trail. Five minutes after lunch we walk into Quarry Gap Shelter; a truly magical place on the AT. The caretaker needs to be thanked daily. There was no graffiti, no carved initials in wooden beams, no trash anywhere in sight. There was a rolled windbreak at the rear of the breezeway, a roof and flower pots over the bear box, a sundial, and a swing (the caretaker is stoning the base under the swing). My words will not present an accurate description; even a single photograph would not do this area justice. We however move on to Caledonia SP. After a half hour walk through the campground searching out an acceptable site, we are established for the next 2 nights. About 1500 I go in search of fuel, or food. The BBQ described in AWOL is no longer there; replaced by Timber diner - breakfast and lunch until 2100.Two huge burgers and baskets of fries - dinner is accomplished. A shower and the rinsing of clothes completed, it is now bedtime.","Campsite

I got up in the middle of the night and noticed there were no visible stars. I had already stretched the rolled tarp over my hammock - just in case. Now I took the time to unroll the tarp, stretch the guy lines, and use whatever was available as anchors. Then, back to sleep, secure in the knowledge that whenever raindrops started I would stay dry. When I did awake there were, in fact, raindrops falling where my head was (as the song suggests), just intercepted by the tarp.Jamie does eventually check on me, she said she had looked earlier and saw the tarp. Without fuel breakfast is cold, but at least there is something. Lunch is still a question. There isn't anything in the food bag and since the pool isn't open due to rain, the snack bar appears closed. I do need to stretch my legs and suggest a stroll. Jamie is agreeable, no backpack necessary. We stroll across the park and end in a picnic pavilion where I stretch legs and back. We were just leaving when Goldberry appears (I had met her at Trail Angel Mary's in Duncannon) announcing ""trail magic"" at the first pavilion on the AT. Poof! Lunch! I feel a little embarrassed showing up without pack and on a zero day, but you just can't pass magic. (You also don't seem to be able to explain its appearance just when you need it either.)Hamburgers, hot dogs, lettuce, tomatoes. Delicious! And the rain stopped. We await the arrival of Melody and our ride. Dinner is found tonight at Roy Pitz, a nearby brewpub. Tonight we again sleep in the rain.

Viper ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539196,"Okay, there will be no trail miles for a number of days. I will however fill in the days with my own commentary. Today is a travel day - Fayetteville to Washington. I can even drive. It is quite a different sensation traveling at a mile a minute or better when for weeks I've been measuring miles in hours rather than minutes, or sometimes, in seconds. One item that I thought about during this trip was the ""Ampy."" ""Ampy"" is a kinetic charger; you move, it charges its battery. Reportedly an hour of exercise is the equivalent of an hour's charge for a portable device (read cell phone, Ipod, IPad, Kindle). And I tested it, without problems. I walked, it worked as expected. It, however, had not arrived in time for my shake down hikes in November. So I hadn't realized it needs rythymical movement.Walking is rythymical movement; hiking could be. But hiking the AT does not often offer opportunity to hike with a constant consistent rythym. You chop steps to find footing on a rocky path. You shorten, or lengthen, stride to assure solid and balanced footing. I put the device in my pocket, back pocket or front pocket, it made no difference, after 4 days I had a charge, just barely 25 percent. I tried other locations, on the side and top of my pack, on my ankle, on my forearm, even attached to a trekking pole. After I hit it against 2 rocks when it was attached to my ankle, I decided not to tempt fate and maybe break it. None of the other locations fared any better. I couldn't get better than a 25 percent charge which equated to about 3 or 4 percent increase in battery on my cell phone. I've decided that the ""Ampy"" works; just isn't effective for my current application at what it weighs. It has been regulated back to the equipment box. It will be used for other charging duties.Jamie was trying to see friends in the area, Thursday's effort didn't work. But there was a play she wanted to see opening at the local theatre. A thunderstorm took care of that; no power at the theatre, show cancelled. We ended the day watching a DVD movie at home, ""The Way."" Coincidently it was both a movie she had purchased for me and it was about a long-distance hike, the Camino de Santiago. It must have been good; I didn't fall asleep. It was after midnight when I finally went to bed - well after my normal bedtime (twilight usually, dark absolutely).","Caledonia State Park

(I didn't have to be concerned with traffic for the past 7 weeks.) I am there by 0750 and in the exam room almost immediately. The nurse did a double-take to make sure I was really standing on the scale (with both feet). Yes, I am - but I'm also 20 pounds lighter.After the appointment I take care of other personal issues. I pick up new eyeglasses (replacements for the ""Port Clinton affair""). I also return a signed, dated receipt to a financial institution. (The request for the document was received in early May. It was one thing - there will be others - for which I hadn't planned.) Then a stop at my pharmacy - drugs (just in case). I stop for coffee at an old haunt only to find most of the ""old guys"" gone already. I do find the retired judge and get updated on recent county news.I make a special trip to a local golf club to see if Walter still has a standing 1215 Friday tee time. He does; he nearly falls over when he sees me - he has been worried about my safety.Then a trip to see my mother - she has also been worried about my safety. This should reassure her (it won't really, mothers are like that). And I'm home in time to accompany ""Jamie"" to the airport. And then she's off - it was fun. I am thankful I had an opportunity to spend time with her (actually thankful that she took, or made, time to spend with me - especially so close to Father's Day). It really is about Smiles - not Miles. We did have quite a few.Now I return to the hike. Or rather return to REI. We stop so I can get new boots, new inner soles, and liner socks (Who knew they manufactured liner socks with individual toes. Maybe I'll quit stepping on my little toes.) Also I get a product called ""Skin,"" a cream which works like Body Glide to reduce/prevent chafing. Maybe now even if I do step on those little toes they won't abrade when rubbing.Enough for today, we end the day with a movie at home.

I'd questioned it when the clerk started to hand it to me but was assured it was ""raspberry."" My sense of taste said otherwise. Small pieces of the berry in the ice cream confirmed my belief. The other employees agree with me when I return. The second serving is correct - Raspberry. I don't know why I'm craving raspberry.

And I've added a detour for a lunch stop en route with Jim and Gina. I'd a breakfast item in mind from the Buttonwood. When we arrived I found that breakfast was only served until 1400. My watch indicated I still had several minutes. The breakfast cook apparently had a different watch (or was in a new time zone) and was gone. So I had a true lunch, a pleasant lunch, with an old friend (guess I don't truly have many of those - something to work upon - and previously noted). Lunch and visit over, we continue across some areas of my home state I have not travelled. This turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable drive, even with minor road construction. I do need to allow Melody a break. She has been doing all of the driving. And the roads, now in New York, are bumpy. They post signs that read: BUMP. There are numerous such signs along the route we're traveling. Based on the condition of our route, the Empire State should simply save money and post one sign: THIS IS A BUMPY ROAD - REALLY BUMPY. There is a medium sized plastic container (a small trunk if you will) that is referred to as ""camp-in-a-box."" A call to a campground on our route, a short diversion from our route, and the tent is up in minutes. I even have a reference to a good local restaurant. We check first, by phone, and discover they are closing as we speak.Welcome to rural America, where streets ""roll up"" as street lights come on. Another suggestion is obtained. It of course is further away. The restaurant was very nice, the food was good, and it definitely wasn't crowded. There was one couple sitting at a table when we walked in; we were the last customers in the place. This was before 2100. We were the absolute last customers in either bar or restaurant to leave. We left before 2230. We returned to the campground. I was going to haul the air bed (really an air bed, not mattress) to the rest rooms to inflate it, but there was an electrical service next to the site.

Then, of course, an entry fee - cash only - since I'm not a Maine resident and don't have Maine vehicle registration. But finally on to Katadhin Stream Campground, the base of today's segment. I'd been cautioned by BoulderDash that I should find someone to hike this segment with; he'd seen me going across Lehigh Gap - probably not the smoothest hiker on downhill rock scrambles. But I'm on my own. And off I go. The first miles aren't too bad, just up, I'm still below tree line. Just before that point find two issues: a) there are 3 older hikers pulling on warmer gear, jackets, hats, gloves, and b) 3 younger hikers are already on their way down and reporting wind gusts. So I now have first-hand information, and, I know those older hikers know ""stuff."" On with all the clothes I have with me; an extra layer over what I now have on, gloves, and a warm cap.Then I'm above tree line. Nothing new, more rocks, some with rebar drilled in, some without. I'm right behind the older guys, who remind me to let them know if they are too slow and I need to pass. Need to pass, really! I'm just trying hard to keep up. And the wind is gusting, sometimes to the point that I find it easier on all fours. I'm not standing and leaning into ""space."" That is illogical.But I/we ( me and them) finally get to ""the top."" And I'm relieved, but little else. This isn't the start for me, not the end, not even the mid-point. Just a point on a map. There are others celebrating the end, and some, the beginning. Me, I'm just here. The views are fantastic. I do understand why this has been chosen as a terminal point. But I don't feel celebratory, just relieved I've made it this far. And, I remember that I will have more difficulty going down than I had coming up. Up is always easier for me.So - without too much more reflection, I start back. And it is more difficult. I'm cold, really cold. Just less than shivering; it wasn't like this when I started. So I go slowly and cautiously. Finally I'm back at the tree line. And at least one older hiker remarks about my condition. His comment was to the effect that I looked hypothermic. He probably wasn't far off, I kept getting colder. But I also was at tree line. I spent a good hour just below that point, in a protected spot, eating my lunch. And everything else I'd brought for snacks. At the end I felt better, warmer, more comfortable. I then continued down for another half hour. Warmer, I removed the extra clothing layer.

Viper ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545693,"So... today I needed to figure out how to get in and out of Baxter State Park without paying that fee. It's not that I object to the fee - but once is enough if you only plan on needing to be in the park twice - Maine residents get enough of a break. They pay no entrance fee and they can book campsites anytime. Which is why I couldn't get a site in the park.I thought about hiking in and out but that makes an 18-mile day. Local maps show additional trails in this area. And, it's hot and humid. The original decision was to hike in on a side trail and south on th AT. The connector trail is Blueberry Ledges. When I got to the junction I decided to hike the long leg, the AT portion, first. The temperature was cooler. The Ledges trail is only 4.4 miles. The AT in Maine is exactly what I expected. No rocks - roots. Lots and lots of roots. But 4 hours later, 1100, I'm in Baxter at Katahdin Stream Campground. After lunch I found the Park Ranger who questioned me yesterday. Today, she had another question: Did I have my yellow slip? No, I don't have a yellow slip, I don't have to register...I didn't hike in from more than 100 miles, as far as Baxter is concerned I originated here. That's true, but today you hiked in. So I have a yellow registration slip.Before I leave I check those I'd passed. Einstein's summit was last week of May - right after the park opened. I guess quite a few hikers arrived mid-May only to find the park still closed. They shuttled to Abol Bridge and started from there. Tin Man completed the second week of June. Goat turned around on his yo-yo about the same time.Then off to The Birches shelter and Blueberry Ledges. I couldn't stay at The Birches -rules. You can't stay here unless you've hiked in more than 100 miles. And how would anyone know? But, rules are for a reason, the Park Ranger explained... I understand. It makes little difference anyway.Blueberry Ledges is a pine forest (read swampy ground under evergreen canopy). Oh yes, and there are bugs. Two mosquitos tried to steal my pack at The Birches. Repellant was applied in short order. I did manage to get the pack back on before the mosquitos got additional numbers. It's amazing how fast they arrive when animals,like me,stop.But the trail is much shorter. After about an hour and a half I arrive at a clearing. A very large clearing. Observation suggests ""cleared by fire,"" not by design. And, as usual, I lose the trail. The cairn indicated a right turn. I look right and see the back of a female with daypack jogging toward what looks like a small river, or large stream? I get to the water's edge and see no obvious route across. There is no through - it's wide, and it's all rapids. Further scouting reveals the girl, apparently with her father, having lunch in what has to be the only shady spot this close to the stream. When I mention the Ledges trail the male tells me I missed the turn, it's left, not right. And he doesn't understand how I could miss it, there's a sign.Back I go, quite carefully; I want to find the sign. I do eventually locate a sign. It is quite obvious, but only if you are coming from Abol Bridge. The sign was probably in the open, with the bar identifying the trail and distance to The Birches about 5 feet off the ground. But some trees have gained a foothold. Some vegetation has returned, even on rock. The sign is now on the left side of the trail as I approached. Hikers from Abol Bridge pass the sign before turning right. The sign fits quite nicely along the tree limbs, hidden from my view by limbs and leaves. There is no posting from the Baxter side indicating destinations and distances.Down the trail. This is easy, it must have been some type of off-road vehicle route; there are parallel ruts for a mile or more. Just after the ruts turn right, I cross the stream bridge. There are two otters under the bridge, but only briefly. It's like I came into view and they simply disappeared.Within a few minutes I'm back at the trail junction. The sign on the back of the kiosk tells me to turn in my yellow registration slip. I guess so Baxter can report I safely left the park grounds (It didn't happen on my watch.). But the box is stuffed with yellow slips. No one must have been reported missing. No reason to empty the box (which, by the way, wasn't secured in any manner). Easier excuses I guess.Now I'm back in the campground. Life must be prosperous here. A large pavilion is under construction, the covered area must be 60 by 100. That doesn't include an enclosed kitchen and full bar. Or the hot tub.Another night with Melody, another breakfast at the campground (included with the camping fee and where I had breakfast today) and then off into the 100-mile wilderness.","Katadhin

I tell her, very honestly, that I haven't looked at a map for weeks - I'm just following white blazes. Also that the trail probably goes back over the river. (I've looked at the guide, it is a river, the Penobscot River. Just like Major Houlihan's boyfriend.)I go back out the rear of the campground, through the pavilion. And within ten minutes I'm back at the front of the campground, lined up to cross the river, again.

Maine seems to have as many roots as Pennsylvania had rocks, which is quite a lot, all across the trail.Wasn't much to comment, one last view of Katahdin shared with a group of teenage boys on a 50-mile trek. Beaver ponds, or was it only one, long and narrow, I don't recall seeing a distinct division.Then a circus. I can hear them for at least a mile, about 25 minutes, before I actually see them. I would have thought there were 30 people coming. There were only 11, teenage girls; the boys I hadn't heard until I walked into the clearing. These girls were obviously not happy about being in the woods. And they wanted their leader, and anyone else within an air mile, to know it. I could hear them after passing for another 20 minutes.I get to the lean-to about 1500, not bad considering my later than usual start. There is a prone figure in the shelter. I'm not even considering disturbing him. The lean-to has a ""baseball bat"" floor. Not my sleeping preference. The hammock will be fine. The floor of the lean-to is constructed of small logs, about 3-inch diameter, laid side by side, like the inside structure of a corrugated box.I do go to the shelter to cook dinner and find ""Spider Man"" awake. He remarks on the comfort of the floor even with his pad, not very comfortable. We discuss why the floor was designed as such. The conclusion are simple; very easy construction and when built hikers were probably using pine boughs for insulation. Laid properly, the boughs likely filled the gaps as well.We are the only two here for the night. There's a breeze at my elevation behind the shelter which minimizes the bugs.","Abol Bridge Campground

But the next lean-to was right above the ""falls"" (I think Rapids more accurate). There is a cooler breeze. At least it's cooler than me moving through the air. Lunch is quick. I've miles to go and have dallied long enough.I get another ten miles and cross West Branch Ponds Road. Back into the woods, about two miles to go. I step up on a root with my right foot and step over with my left. Somewhere in that movement I slip... Not a big slip, I don't fall, I just land on my right foot with the leg locked. AND I immediately know what happened. AND it isn't good. At a minimum I've pinched a nerve. One that has been pinched before. Spasms... Hold the trekking poles... Don't fall... It's roots and rocks. It's also about a mile and a half to the lean-to. The spasm subsides. I go slow. Very slow. But forward. I get to the lean-to about 1700. I don't set up. I find the nearest spot to water. And I get a cool soak. Dinner is late.Decisions need to be made. I've medication for this issue. But it makes me dizzy. Can I hike dizzy? How fast can I go? How far can I get? I have dinner conversation with three other hikers (names unrecorded, medication had been administered). There are radical elevation changes ahead. To reverse direction I'll be mostly down grade, or flat. The trail will remain constant in composition.I'll sleep on it. Make my decision in the morning.","Potaywadjo Spring Lean-to

I know I was awakened by my back multiple times. No spasms...just sharp pain.More medication. Breakfast. Decision.From conversation last night there is more traffic on Jo-Mary Road than West Branch Ponds Road. I know I saw, or heard, at least four private vehicles at Jo-Mary Road; I saw nothing at the other. And Jo-Mary is a point at which hikers can get a mid-wilderness supply pick-up. Several hostels offer this service. Fill a 5-gallon bucket with your supplies, tell them when you'll cross Jo-Mary, and they will give you a location for your bucket. Take your supplies, leave your trash. Sounds to me like I'm more likely to get a ride from there.I don't plan on returning there in one day. I'll make it a 2-day trip. I go light on water; it's the heaviest thing in my pack and there is water everywhere. I can take my time and make more stops. I'll probably need them.I make the eight miles in about six hours. No spasms. Just the recurring pain. It doesn't ever go away...just peaks and ebbs.I find a spot right by the stream.

No canopy tonight, I tighten up everything.I get into the hammock right after dinner. And it rains immediately. Hard. For a short time I thought I might have picked the wrong spot. Water was draining down the rocks on the side of the tarp. I'd pitched the tarp to the base of those rocks, if the rain was brief I'd have a canopy to the top of those rocks. But the water flowed away from the hammock and everything stayed dry. Sometimes dry is good.I don't know how long the rain lasted. After set up and dinner, more medication.

I can take my time with breakfast. Add medication. And wait for the dizziness to subside.Then it's off to the road. I actually got a better start today, 0630. Or maybe I fell asleep earlier last night. The road is a welcome sight. I'd left my cell phone handy and had the hostel number programmed. I walked out on the bridge and turned on the phone. Nothing. No signal. The battery was holding a charge. But there wasn't any signal. How did those other two make calls.I was still standing in the center of the bridge. A car horn behind me. I hadn't seen a vehicle traveling toward the main highway the other day when I'd been here, but that's the direction the vehicle was traveling. I tried to get off the bridge.I guess I didn't move very well. It must have been pretty obvious. The vehicle, a Yukon, stooped, the window came down, there were three adult males, camping, and fishing gear. The driver asked if I was alright. I explained my slow movements. He asked if I needed a ride. I couldn't refuse...but I did tell him I hadn't had a shower for a few days.They wound down the windows and took me as far as Milo. I couldn't explain how thankful I was. The driver, Bill, wouldn't take gas money. I offered to buy a round of drinks, or a case. No one accepted anything. Or maybe they were just happy to get me out of the Yukon, wind the windows up, and run the air conditioning.But I was in Milo, Maine. Cell phone out, call the hostel. No signal. Really? I'm in town, surely ATT has service in Maine. But obviously not in Milo.I was standing on a corner at the edge of town; I could see the rest of the town from my location. And there was a pub right there. The entrance was in back. So around the building I go. The building is L-shaped. The long leg is the pub, the short side a beauty salon. I get about 30 feet across the rear parking lot when a lady's voice asks: ""Are you lost?"" I confirm for her I am not lost, just going to the pub. She announced that it was closed. It was about 1145. I told her I'd wait, it should open shortly. She told me it was close - permanently. I asked where the nearest public phone might be located and explained my cell phone issue.She told me there was a phone in the salon. I explained my lack of a recent shower and that neither she nor her customers might be happy with my presence. That did not deter her. I found myself inside with her business phone, a cup of coffee, and a comfortable chair, thankfully in a far corner of an empty room.Two phone calls and two hours later my shuttle arrived. Off to Monson. With a cold soda in my hand...from the cooler in the back of the shuttle.We arrive at the hostel. I'm greeted by Poet who immediately wants to know what type of cold beverage I wanted. Medication doesn't mix well with some beverages. Another soda, thank you.There were many regrets by Poet that the most peaceful room for me was on the second floor and the steps were steep. But the handrail was solid. The bed was solid. The shower was hot, and long. And shortly thereafter my clothes were clean.There was a signup sheet for breakfast. There was also a BBQ within hobbling distance. That's all they do, BBQ. And they make a hamburger with everything, topped with pulled pork. I was hurting, not sick. I wasn't going to sleep hungry.In between shower and BBQ I'd stretched, and returned to the room for another round of stretches. I'd done some stretches over the last two days. I think I may be able to relieve and maybe correct this; I've done it before. Maybe I can do it again.","Cooper Brooks Falls Lean-to

Viper ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545735,"Day 2 in Monson. Breakfast starts when the coffee is ready, about 0645. Food follows. Poet does the cooking. I noticed that Hippy Chick is absent. Poet cooks eggs to order, a rasher of bacon, and some of the best home fries I've had in quite a while. It's probably the century old season of the overgrown cast iron skillet. Poet said it came with the building when they bought the hostel. Eggs, bacon, potatoes are followed by blueberry pancakes. And more blueberry pancakes. Pancakes continuing until the last hiker has had his absolute fill. I return to my room for another round of stretches. I'd done two different stretches before getting out of bed. I didn't notice any difference, but it wasn't any worse. I'd slept reasonably well, I was up twice, I think, both times due to the back. I found a book, a quiet spot, and spent three or four hours reading. I'd stop every chapter or two for more stretches. Then finally more medication and a nap.About 1530 I dressed and hobbled into town, not far really, I think 300 yards covered most of the business district. A stop at the library was required. No WiFi, anywhere. There was another hostel with a bar and restaurant; well more the other way around, a bar and restaurant with rooms available for hikers. There was live music, the food was good, and reasonable, and you can't mix certain beverages with certain medications.On a side note... Last night I'd emptied everything into one wallet and slept with it under the pillow. Since I was dressed in running shorts for breakfast I'd left the wallet in my backpack. There was one other hiker in the room but he was packed to go. After breakfast I'd stretched and dug into my pack for my wallet. But it wasn't there. So I made a careful search...very careful, very thorough. First, empty the pack, one item at a time. If the item was in a stuff sack it was removed from the sack. Every item was laid on the bed. Open all pockets of the pack. Turn upside down, shake, repeat... Then repack the bag. Put all items into their respective stuff sacks, or not as the case any be, and then everything into the backpack. Next my environment. Strip the top sheet and blanket from the bed. Lift up the mattress. Twice. Once laterally, then once again on its length. Under the bed. Nothing. Frustration. All my identification, cash, and plastic. Now I'm checking waste baskets and trash cans. Nothing.The rest of the house is nearly empty and Poet is awaiting commercial washer and dryer. I think about breakfast and who was, or wasn't, there. After about another hour I mention the missing wallet to one person. Oh, I can't cancel the ATM card, there isn't ATT service in Monson. There is, however, WiFi. Nearly town wide, every business has WiFi. You can sit in one business and if you don't like their WiFi, connect to an adjacent building/business. So I'd done the Messenger thing. Not my thing, but a necessary evil under existing circumstances. So I contact Melody using the hostel's WiFi. Update her on situation.The laundry equipment inside and nearly installed, I mentioned my ""walking"" wallet to Poet. He insists on searching the room. And he finds the wallet. No joke. Grabbed the top of the mattress near the headboard, slid it a little, and reached in, came out with a wallet. Of special note, there were three people in the room; me, Poet, and the person to whom I'd spoken about the wallet. Who would have thought that possible?As noted, the rest of the day was uneventful. I returned after my fairly early dinner, stretched, medicated myself, and off to bed.","Monson, ME

Light stretching, breakfast, serious stretches, book/read with more intervals of stretching. Medication, nap.Dinner. The BBQ has ribs. They only have ribs one day a week. The pulled pork was excellent. I hobble there. Fortunately I get there just before the bus. This must be a notable place. Short on service, you find the bartender, place your order, leave your name, and they ""holler for you"" when your order is ready. The other day I'd had to pay when I placed the order. Today I don't pay until I'm done eating. They weigh each rib order; you pay by the pound.The bus crowd nearly fills the inside; there is outside seating. But inside is cooler and I'm not hiking.

Apparently someone has a carbide cannon, or something similar. It's loud, it's frequent, and tonight it's continuous. I know they are not celebrating Independence Day.

Except maybe for the hiking part. It's the uneven surface. On smooth surfaces your foot comes down heel first and your weight transfers as your foot goes forward ending withe you pushing off your toes. Generally. And your hand-eye, or foot-eye, coordination knows how high to lift your leg for the next step. Not so on uneven surfaces - especially those that appear smooth but have that rock - that root - 1/4, 1/8, even 1/16 of an inch above ""grade."" Your hell catches that slight rise. Your weight is going forward yet that foot/leg is now stopped even just momentarily. At best your cadence is broken.

So first a mile hike to the pass under Sandy Hook (really, that's the name of the road) Bridge.I'm gambling on some sort of path from the C&O Canal towpath to Sandy Hook Road and Harper's Ferry Hostel. 
But first I get to the canal towpath and check for possible campsites along the canal; they are usually every 5 miles. Except here, where it appears the nearest in either direction is 5 miles, or more, from the bridge at Harper's Ferry.
I travel the towpath and I win the gamble. I find the path, cross the tracks (and there is a sign about trespass on the other side facing away from me, I ultimately see it later) over the guiderail and up the hill to the hostel. 
I arrive and find a shaded picnic table where I reflect at great length (about half an hour) upon having to wait until 1700 for the hostel to open. At the end of that half hour it's still only 1215; much too early and much too much day left. 
Onward to Harper's Ferry. By 1500 I've resupplied at The Outfitters, had lunch at the Cannonball Deli, gotten ice cream at The Swiss Miss,and hiked up the AT to the ATC.
The requisite photograph was taken and I had to identify myself as a section hiker (more depression), ATC #490.
On the positive side I meet ""Jailbird"" who claims he's from Pittsburgh (later New Castle). He graciously accepts a Terrible Towel to add color to his photo. 
Later over dinner conversation we discover his brother lived where I worked. Even more unusual was that his sister-in-law was the secretary where I worked. It was like we became instant family. We took a photo and sent it to her (technology is sometimes okay) awaiting her response; she seemed shocked that we would have met let alone find the link.

I hadn't realized how depressed I was over not being able to complete the trail this year. I really didn't feel like updating anything. But reality is the world in which I live - live with it.
Updating the journal was longer than expected, all morning and part of the afternoon. ""Jailbird"" went to town with Franci, a German tourist staying at the hostel. When he returns early afternoon I'm almost finished with the journal. A reminder to myself not to let that happen again. 
Jailbird and I go off to lunch at the café. They close at 1500; the sign on the door days they quit seating at 1445. They also serve WV-made foot long hot dogs. And they are foot longs; they exceed the bun on both sides and are served cut in half. I wasn't exceptionally pleased with the experience, but the Chicago hot dog was very good. On the down side, I asked if they could make an Arnold Palmer; no problem; after 2 trips out was decided there was no lemonade. I asked about the soup du jour; they don't serve soup on hot days, but they do have chili. I order a cup. When my hot dog arrives so does the announcement that they don't have chili. Oh, and we have stopped taking food orders. But, as I said, what did come out was good. 
We return and I complete my afternoon stretching. Hopefully this will work. 
Jailbird wants to take Franci to dinner. We leave at 1915 for a walk down the street. We check the menu at The Anvil which does look interesting inside. We check at the Bijou Bistro, and decide to dine there, a New Orleans style restaurant in Harper's Ferry. The food was exceptional, not too spicy although I did check with the local customers seated behind us; the menu stated ""the essence of New Orleans."" Based on the well-known chef from that city, I was afraid someone in the kitchen would go ""Bam,"" or ""Bam"" several times on different portions of my meal. No, my shrimp and crab in New Orleans roux over rice was just spicy enough without being overpowering.

The night was clear and breezy and I had to layer take the bug net off the hammock to actually feel the breeze; it was humid. But finally - breezes - and sleep.

I might have even been quicker but it's Saturday and day hikers abound. Groups and groups of them. They have no etiquette; no trail manners. While I'm on an uphill climb a day hiker followed by his girlfriend just walked into me without ever looking up. I'd seen him coming, talking over his shoulder, so I stepped to my right and speed at the edge of the trail. I'd said ""Good Morning"" but he didn't acknowledge me. And he wasn't wearing ear plugs.
New hiker etiquette - if approached by a hiker wearing a backpack, uphill, downhill, or on the level, the backpacker has right-of-way. End. Period.

Viper ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547321,"I'm spacing stops based on the fact that I have to come off the trail for several days - family issue. But I'll hike for the next 2 days. Today is interesting. I short climb then descent into Ashby Gap. I recognize this highway, it's VA 17; I've traveled it many times en route to Washington, D.C., or Quantico. 
But today I cross the highway and start a climb to Sky Meadows. A climb that takes me nearly 2 hours. Fortunately someone put a bench at the top. And I put conveniently located furniture to good use. After sitting I noticed my highway crossing was 2.9 miles back. What a long grade! My feet and hips knew what my eyes had been telling them - even when it didn't appear so, the trail was distinctly, inevitably, and continually uphill. 
And the climb played cruel tricks. I could see daylight clearly through the tree trunks on my horizon. Then there would be a switchback, no more sky, just more climbing. There were also a series of meadows (Sky Meadows, remember?). But the trail wove through these in a series of serpentine curves that never failed to take full advantage of every slight grade. 
After the park another relatively short steep decent and yet more uphill. This was simply a repeat of this morning. Like Superman, up, up, and - oh well - more up. 
I need 2 extra breaks today. The atmosphere is dense, high humidity, high temperature makes the ""real feel"" temperature over 100.
Somehow I miss the second spring that's in the guide. (Probably had a sign that is only on the south side of a large diameter tree.) I start nursing my water supply. 
I reach my destination about 1445. This spring is running about a liter per minute (much better than yesterday). And is it cold! A better hour hasn't been spent in quite a while. 
At 1800 I'm still by myself. I don't expect any company, school's probably in session, it's a weekday, and I'm SOBO.
I hang the hammock in the shelter. I'm planning a night hike to try to avoid some of this heat, weather is getting to me. I have dinner done by 1800 and I'm in the hammock 15 minutes later. 
I plan on getting up about 0400 and getting on the trail, with headlamp, by 0500.","Rod Hollow Shelter

Viper ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547487,"Well, today was supposed to start at 0400. I'd planned to beat some of this heat with a little bit of a night hike. The plan was to wake at 0400 and be on the trail by 0500. I'd have to use my headlamp for about an hour. Then take a break, let my eyes adjust, and then continue. Well, that was the plan. I'd gone to sleep at 1800. I slung my hammock in the shelter; there wasn't any one else around. Things always fall on the roof from trees. But I awoke about 2230 hearing what I believed to be things falling on the interior shelter floor. It was pitch dark. On goes the headlamp. As I start to look around I'm sure something dropped into my hammock. I get out and get a better look.
At first nothing. Then I get a look at the corner behind me. It was like the scene from Indiana Jones. The actress states the floor is moving. Harrison FoRd drops the torch and says: ""Snakes!""
Yes, snakes. Lots and lots of little snakes. Coming out of the wall and falling on the floor. Falling into my boots. And landing in my hammock. I launch the one outide from the hammock. I pound on the floor with a trekking pole. The vibration causes them to slither back into the wall. 
Must be time to pack. My callsign (trailname) is Viper. I can't identify these. They are about 6 to 9 inches long,about the diameter of my shoelace, and dark grey or black. All cats are grey in the dark. 
I get all my belongings on the picnic table. My boots have been by the shelter opening. The inner soles were tilted to air the boot. I'd watched at least 2 snakes land on these like sliding boards. Zip, right into the boot.
So, empty the boots; 4 in one, 2 in the other. Then, empty my pack. Everything out, then everything repacked. No snakes. 
A postscript note in the shelter register. I'm ready to hike. It's 2300. And it's a great hike. But it's still humid. Within the first hour I'm sweating about as much as I was this afternoon.
And I get to view wildlife. Two does and a very proud pronghorn just stand perfectly still while I walk in close proximity. There are two instances where I hear what sounds like a bear. When I turn to look I'm searching in heavy vegetation. That's where bears usually are. If it sounds like a bear...
I have no problems. I actually walk as fast as I do in daylight. I'm at Jim & Molly Denton Shelter about 0200.
Well some things done right. Now for things done wrong. My hiking clothes work on evaporative principles. I've been sweating. The temperature is dropping, not much, but some. Enough to cause me to start to chill. 
I see one person sleeping in the shelter. Rather than disturb him I drop my gear on the picnic table. I continue to chill. In fact I start to shiver. That's a clue; time to eat. Heat water. Hot chocolate in a Nalgene bottle. Oatmeal into the rest of the hot water in the pot. The hot chocolate bottle becomes a ""hot water bottle"" tucked under my shirt while I eat oatmeal. 
As soon as the shivers subside I get into my rain gear. Vapor barrier. Once I eat the rest of the oatmeal and drink the hot chocolate I'm warm enough for a nap. 
I get a nap until 0530. I repack my gear and I'm off by 0600. At 0830 I'm on the porch of the hostel. A shower and then sleep.","Manassas Gap Shelter

Then a coyote; which immediately disappears. Shortly after I see an owl in a clearing along the trail. It leaves silently-but carrying what appears to be a squirrel. Breakfast at the wayside. And, take a sandwich for a layer snack. I still have no phone signal. I try to get change for the pay phone (yes Superman, there still is a phone booth). The cashier asks why I want change. When I explain, she tells me the phone is broken, has been all summer, no one comes to fix it. But she lets me use her landline - I leave a message so Melody won't worry. 
Then on to Pass Hut for lunch and water. There's a bear coming down a tree at the Hut area. With all the bear scat I'd passed on the trail I'd been expecting to see a bear in that area. (Which answers the question: Does a bear poop in the woods? Apparently not if it can poop on the trail instead.) Lots of fresh piles of scat. Berries are in season. 
Not a big bear, but a bear nonetheless. Which doesn't stay long enough for a photo. 
Then on to Byrd's Nest #3 (which is better than ""Snake's Nest""). Another climb, a long climb, dayhikers - with NO trail etiquette. I'm climbing, they refuse to yield (uphill hikers have right-of-way). Two abreast or single file in the middle of the trail - it doesn't matter. I actually stopped a line of them by standing kisser a little left of three right trail edge. They couldn't get by me and didn't know what to do. I knew what to do. When they stopped I marched on. 
But I lose momentum with each stop - 16 of those stops by my count - to Mary's Overlook. It was a great view.

I can't spot the sow, but I do get another look at the ""cub."" It has a long tail and pointed ears. A coyote, has to be. (I later spoke with a park ranger who confirmed other rangers have reported similar sightings - NOT an hallucination.)
Skyland, 1000 hours, breakfast. And a Labor Day special, buffet breakfast. NO choice here. (I doubt they made money on my meal.)
An hour and a half later I'm back on the trail. I'm hiking, well not really. Something to do with digestion and exertion probably. (Like don't go swimming for an hour after eating.)
But lunch is ahead. Big Meadows Wayside, 7.7 miles. I arrive at 1500. Exhausted. Not hungry. But thirsty. Gatorade - one quart - followed by a quart of water. I also refill my water bladder, still in my pack. I siphon 2 quarts of water. A girl, about 10, asks what I'm doing; she is watching the water level in the Gatorade bottle go down. Her mother has started in my direction. SO, I initially told her the backpack was thirsty. THEN, I explained about the bladder and siphon principle. Mom understood. 
But still not hungry. I force down a granola bar and a Snickers (""force,"" that even sounds odd, for me) and wash them down with another quart of Gatorade. 
It's 1615, I have 8.2 miles to Bearfence Hut before dark and sunset is now about 1945. I'm off as quickly as I can go. Buut, as usual, everything is uphill. I'm burnt out by 1915 and I'm now hiking on the east side of the mountain and going north. 
The hut is supposed to be off a gravel road and then a side trail. I do get to a gravel road. There are 3 backpacks (with legs) walking toward me. They are yelling for ""Uncle Jimmy."" More backpacks with legs coming north on trail. Followed by adults. We are all seeking Bearfence. 
The signpost is impossible to read without glasses. Little letters stamped in metal bands. But I'm (we're) here.
All told there must be 6 or 7 adults and twice as many children, mostly very young, and, of course, 3 dogs.

In addition to their main product they produced great BBQ meals. Dinner was served.They also provided a camping area toward which I was directed at the end of dinner, but before I closed the check.

As soon as I tell them the girl hands me a cup of coffee and directs me to sit down, my hiker special will be out shortly. And it is special - about 3 eggs scrambled, a rasher of bacon, home fries, fruit salad, and a biscuit with a thick slice of cheddar cheese. Breakfast wasn't served until 0700 and it took me 45 minutes to finish. I needed additional time to charge my phone; I'd left it running last night.When I was completely done, the young lady asked if I was ready to go. I said yes and they arranged for a ride up to the gap. Convenience, at its best. A late start though, it was nearly 1000. Not too bad, I was only hiking to Harpers Creek, but over the Three Ridges area.I start my day with my usual, a climb. But with a new twist - Rocks. Not the big rocks of yesterday; small rocks (B gravel size), not necessarily rounded, but like walking on a gravel path. Not ankle-twisters, but always willing to shift under my weight, whether ascending, descending, or flat (?) side-hill. And there was a lot of side-hill. The trail was worn and sloped with the hillside. Going was slow, but steady.About 1230 I though I might have reached the summit. There were 4 people on a rock outcropping. But no, the summit is yet another mile - UP. I get a look at The Priest - tomorrow's climb - 3100 feet over 5 miles - but that's tomorrow. Today I reach the summit of the third ridge. There are no views. I continue onward.It's now downhill, the little rocks remain constant. I arrive at Harpers Creek about 1600 and set up. Two of the hikers are over-nighting here as well. They arrive an hour and a half later. We chat over dinner. Harpers Creek is down to a trickle; I had to scoop out a basin to collect water. I wonder when it will rain. These hikers are out for 3 days. One is in real estate; the other is a stay-at-home dad. Nice guys.But sunset is 1935 - and so is bedtime.","Reeds Gap

It wasn't a hard rain. But it continued to fall steadily. No one was in the shelter. I simply moved my gear. The transition took no more than 10 minutes.But for whatever reason I was still awake at 0200. I finally dozed off and awoke at 0615 - still raining. I got out and started moving at 0800. The rain has nearly let up. I'm on the trail about 0945, down to the Tye River. Then over the river and through the woods, UP the mountain, and over The Priest.The little rocks are still with me, all day. They are most annoying when I need to use my rear foot to push off. If I'm on some of those rocks (most of the time) no traction - spinout -down to that knee. It takes a while but I figure out how to minimize the problem; I never completely solve the problem. I climb for 2 hours, then lunch; no view, just a nice clearing. A hiker coming down stops to change into lighter weight clothes. He complained of cold temperatures at the top. He also said he slipped several times and had fallen once. I took note and was on my way.Leaves covering the trail. Wet leaves covering wet rocks. Yes, this could be slippery. I had noted the abundance of acorns that had fallen in the days before I reached Harpers Ferry. There were more now, sometimes like puddles of marbles in the trail. Except now the majority were brown, not green. Matured.I've just realized that summer is almost gone - maybe 6 more days, officially. At the summit, it's hard to tell, I'm on a ridge, I get some views on rock outcroppings to the north. It's not raining, but it has been overcast all day, so very limited views. And now it is cooler with the elevation. I check in with home and plans for my son to meet and hike next week.Then on to the shelter. I don't know if it was the hiker's comments or the actual change in temperature but I'm shivering when I get there. Hypothermia at its best, I'm soaked with sweat after the climb and probably a bit short on my water intake due to the cooler temperatures. I dump the contents of my pack and within 10 minutes I'm snuggled in the hammock inside the shelter with my rain suit on (vapor barrier principle) and quilts and pads.Two hours later I'm warm enough for cooking dinner. I pick the largest dinner in my pack. After dinner I managed to change clothing. I'm expecting more rain. I leave the hammock strung.

It had rained last night, probably starting about midnight. Just as I was leaving another hiker appeared. He claimed he got in late and was forced to camp out when he saw the hammock. I told him the hammock was mine; that I was wrong to have left it up after dinner. I think he had planned a sermon, or expected an argument. I don't think he was prepared for an instant admission of guilt and an apology. (I wish I'd asked for his trail name to give him proper recognition for speaking up for the right reasons.)His gear and dress appeared quite ""retro."" He had a frame pack that looked handmade. The frame appeared to be from a single piece of wood in a ""U"" shape; the proper width for the canvas pack bag. He was dressed in what looked like woolen long-legged bottoms and a T-shirt. He carried two wooden hiking staffs.But I was off too quickly, too many miles to cover. I stopped for lunch at Steeley-Woodworth Shelter and refill water while I'm there. There is a section hiker just packing to leave. He has apparently been reading some of my SOBO journal entries. The day clears and I seem to be on the 500-foot roller coaster; 500 feet up, 500 feet down - seems endless.About 1700 I reach Cow Camp Gap. (I don't know where they get these names; I'd hiked through Hog Camp Gap a few miles back. I've seen neither hogs nor cows.) Oh, it's a nice half mile hike DOWN to the shelter. Which clearly means it's a half mile hike UP out of here first thing tomorrow.And at the shelter area - Boy Scouts. They seem to arrive every weekend. There are two groups; the other has split into two groups due to their numbers. I choose the smallest group and set up there. I manage to get water, cook and eat dinner, set up for bed and fall asleep without much disturbance from this group.","Priest Shelter

I ask where she's off to and she tells me I'd have to ask her husband. He's behind her and ""he's in charge."" I continue on, chuckling about her response - the husband's in charge. I have my mid-morning snack at US 60 at a picnic table. When I'd nearly finished a male hiker passed by asking about the lady. I acknowledged that we'd passed probably 15 minutes prior. I also asked how he came to be ""in charge."" He noted that he probably wasn't; his wife would stop at 1030 until he caught up - then tell him how much farther she was hiking today.I stopped briefly at Brown Mountain Shelter (really close to the trail) when the hiker there said he was NOBO. He'd stayed at Punchbowl Shelter and the water availability was good. The shelter was up on the mountain and I just wanted assurance that I didn't have to haul water up there.On another climb of the day I passed another SOBO hiker. When I stopped at Blue ridge Parkway, mile 51.7 to unload my trash (really - a trash can, an actual trash can there) I had difficulty locating the trail on the opposite side of the highway. The hiker I'd just passed arrived and immediately pointed out the trail location. He said he'd done a thru hike 8 years ago and that the shelter was about 400 feet up.Well, maybe the shelter was 400 feet above the level of the road, but it was about a half mile of steady ascent. Then ""down"" to the shelter - another climb in the morning.The forecast (from the Boy Scout leader and the hiker at Brown Mountain shelter) was 50% chance of rain Sunday night and Monday. There will be no hammock tonight. I'll stay in the shelter and hopefully keep stuff dry.The other SOBO hiker, Castaway, arrives. He continues his tale of his thru hike adventure, history past. This venture is a 3-day hike to Jennings Creek.Snakebite arrives. Dinner is completed. Tonight I have difficulty getting the line for my bear bag thrown over the limb.

I move slowly - hoping things will dry - knowing they won't - everything is just plain damp, at best. I can literally see the moisture on my quilt.But Snakebite is out just after 0700; followed shortly by Castaway. I hope the rain will actually stop. It slows to a drizzle. I leave at 0900. This is only a 10.5 mile day to US 501. I climb out of the shelter area, UP Punchbowl Mountain, and UP to the top of Bluff Mountain (Ottie Cline Powell monument). It had stopped raining on the climb.But it was like walking in a cloud bank. I could see the rising and drifting wind currents due to the cloud (fog?). And it was a very damp breeze.Finally the trail dropped to the lee side of the mountain and I had some protection from the wind. I passed Castaway between Saltlog and Saddle Gaps and picked a spot along Big Rocky Row (aptly named) for lunch. Castaway stopped to chat and take in the view. He departed shortly saying he'd stop at the next shelter for lunch.I pass him yet again before that point. He tells me I shouldn't have problems getting a ride to Glasgow; US 501 is a heavily traveled highway. Well - I'm there at 1400 and I'm still there at 1445. It may be a heavily traveled highway, but most of the traffic is east toward Big Island, not west to Glasgow. The vehicles that are traveling west avoid me like the plague, some all the way into the other lane.At 1450 I start to hike. I'm in a valley, right? How hard can another 6.0 miles of road walk be? It was okay - for a while. Then the traffic sign read: ""Steep grade, sharp curves, next 4 miles."" One look at the shoulders told me to stand fast (I was standing next to a pull-off) and pray someone would stop and give me a ride. Thirty minutes later, prayers answered, a ride. I'd seen this van in the AT parking area, the family and friends from Albuquerque had been out for a day-hike. They left me at the intersection of US 501/VA 130 - a short mile stroll and flat. I pass Snakebite; he's coming out of town (took a blue blaze for supplies).Shortly I find the hiker pavilion (after a stop at the convenience store for 2 quarts of Gatorade). Built by the BSA troop in 2010, it appears to have a little of everything. Electricity, electric lamps and clock, a microwave (yes, really, a functioning unit), hot (yes, hot) showers, and the necessary port-a-potty. And it has ""Nubz,"" who just can't stop telling me about his trials and tribulations. (I don't think the ""trials"" were concerned only with the trail however.) Eventually he spies the number and menu for a lounge and grille. He loves his phone. He'd been talking to someone for the better part of the previous hour. He now calls the lounge and someone has agreed to come pick him up. Another hiker arrives - by car. He is trying to ""connect the dots."" He'd started a thru hike and missed two areas; a 10-mile section from Thunder Hill Shelter due to bear activity and a section near Hot Springs due to fires. He set up, had dinner, and was off to sleep.My dinner came from the Dollar General.

Then lunch at the only restaurant in town, which was closed on Monday, yesterday, and was the main reason I didn't have dinner there last night. I return to the hiker shelter about 1600. I'd packed completely this morning. (I can't be apart from my ""house;"" can't even let it out of sight.)
Nubz is still there. We rehash his trials and tribulations, at least those of the trail. And he continues to consume adult beverages. 
I know it's AYCE spaghetti at the restaurant tonight. So does Nubz. And when I mention dinner Nubz begs to go along. But first, apparently, he needs to find some THC, an acquaintance has just driven into the area. I head for the restaurant. 
I'm started on my first plate when Nubz appears. For the rest of the hour, through my second plate of spaghetti, it takes all of my professional skills and patience to keep him in check and keep the waitress from throwing him (us) out. I, at least, finish the second plate. So much for Nubz' ""munchies.""
Back to the shelter; where I find ""Trouble"" has arrived. Trouble I met in Waynesboro at that hiker pavilion. He has all the AT hiker gossip. And now he has an audience.

Then a quick resupply at the Grocery Express next to the dinosaur. Or maybe it's supposed to be ""Nessie,"" the Loch Ness sea serpent.

We are together for about 30 minutes then my son lags back. Understandable as he is not quite prepared for this. But he will not give up; never has before. He'll find a pace and keep with it. He's only 15 minutes off my arrival at our lunch spot, Petites Gap. There are several pickup trucks with kennels; they are training dogs for bear hunting. One driver reports the dogs turned a bear over the mountain in front of us. This could be interesting. 
We continue to the Thunder Hill Overlook on the BRP (Blue Ridge Parkway). I'm constantly on the watch for a bear, particularly down each draw. And there are quite a few. But no bear(s).
At the overlook the view is spectacular. One hundred eighty degrees of mountains and valleys. Probably a view of Virginia that few realize exists. The shelter is only about a mile and a half away. 
We have an easy climb (if there is such a thing) and are soon there. The spring is still flowing and after dinner it appears no one else is going to arrive. 
I hang the food bag on the first toss. Shortly after dark my son hears something in that vicinity and tells me to light the area. When I do the only thing I see is a mouse walking in front of my nose. No doubt something made noise.

But we make good time (for us) and arrive about 1500. Others arrive in another hour. In fact, 7 of them, all SOBOs. What a sight. SOBOs usually hike alone or in pairs. A group of 7 is highly unlikely. But here they are. And they report an eighth is still behind them. 
They are not stopping for the day; only a break. They expect to hike another 5 miles to the campground for hamburgers and milkshakes, then continue to at least the next shelter, another 4.8 miles. That would be a 24 mile day. And I don't think that includes the 2.4 mile round trip to and from the trailhead. 
We stay however and so do Quill and Tim. Both are allegedly hiking north although I am quite sure Quill arrived from the northern side. (There was a blue blaze that went to trailhead parking.) Quill seems to know a bit about the trail but her story didn't always ring quite right.

It was a two story design with windows. One of the SOBOs yesterday did spot a black snake in the loft. I didn't see any mice about though.

She can cross at her convenience. She doesn't cross but starts toward me, parallel the trail, 50 yards off. So I guess we dance. She parallels the trail. I face her but step backwards and sideways while she gets behind me. Eventually she crosses the trail to the high side. The only thing I can figure is the second cub went uphill and drifted to the right, my rear; I'd watched the first cub cross, climb, and turn left, forward of my location. I'd lost track of the second cub while looking for the sow. She must have wanted to round up the second cub. When she got about 50 or 60 yards on the other side I slowly moved off. The sow however kept me in sight moving parallel the trail for about another 300 yards. I never saw the cubs again, but I did manage a photo or two of the sow. There are 4 deer this morning as well. So breakfast was delayed. But Tinker Cliffs provided an excellent view and relative peace and quiet - except for the loud red blanket someone had hung on a limb out by the edge. There was a tent back off the trail. I did have a thought to send the blanket off the cliff. The thought passed and I found a different secluded spot along the cliff. Next - lunch, on McAfee Knob. I'm there by 1030. I've expected it to be crowded; it's a popular spot and accessible with a moderate hike from another trailhead. I can hear voices but see no one. More peace, quiet, and tranquillity. Then about 1125 I start to see people - everywhere. I guess lunch is over. On toward dinner - VA 311 - and an AYCE place called Homeplace Restaurant. I stop at the trailhead parking lot and check. There is a hostel that provides a shuttle to the restaurant, but only Thursday through Sunday. I figure out why; the restaurant is only open those days. So my hike continues.On to Four Pines Hostel. There by 1710, a trip to the store for a burger and fries. A hot shower then bedtime.","Lambert Meadows Shelter

Viper ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550514,"Today's breakfast will be at the Audie Murphy Monument. As usual I start the day with my morning climb. It's not too bad; I got a late start, about 0930, and arrive at the monument about 1100. I called home and arranged a mail drop; there was phone signal on the ridge.Then on to a late lunch on Dragon's Tooth. Joe, who dropped me off (it's a slack pack day) was okay with a short section hike, about 8.0 miles. I meet him hiking the opposite direction a half hour after my breakfast. As usual, up one side, down the other. Repeat. Again, not too bad. But the I start down the ridge. Up, down, rocks, up, down, rocks - repeat. The longest 4 miles I think I've hiked to this point. I finally arrive about 1500 and have lunch ""in the dragon's mouth?"" (behind the Dragon's Tooth). Great views. Everyone should have lunch here - al fresco seating, no reservations required, spectacular views - but bring your own (food) 'cause they don't serve and you will be hungry when you get here.Only 3 miles to Four Pines. This wasn't mentioned anywhere - a rock scramble - some vertical issues - you can tell - someone has mounted rebar on some of the faces. And it's downhill for me. But it was accomplished. Only 2 slips, both of which ended with my right hip against a rock face.Comet and JetPack didn't mention this. They were quite happy to put a face with the viper stamp; they're a day ahead, at least, now. Youth.At Four Pines - dinner. A double cheeseburger (disassembled) with French fries and 2 large fried eggs on toasted bun. There are chickens here, fresh eggs daily.","Four Pines Hostel

Viper ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550517,"An earlier start today, but colder. Today's morning climb put me on a ridge. There are probably a lot of good views. I was on exposed rock slopes for quite a while. But there are no views today. Only clouds and wind, a really brief shower with an even briefer splash of hail. Slick rock slopes. Another slip, or two, where I stop with my right hip against a rock face. The cold damp breeze continues.Then a complete change for the afternoon - sunshine, open fields, wide open spaces. And the afternoon climb back into the woods and onto the ridge.But Laurel Creek by 1600. Chores. Dinner. Dark - bedtime.","VA 621
