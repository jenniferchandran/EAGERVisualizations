Walkingfish,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517086,"Hello everyone, My name is Paul Godbout, and I am from Summerville SC (29 miles west of Charleston). I have wanted to hike the AT for many years and I am now at the point in my life where I can do it.  I am a 49 years old and happily married to my best friend of 30 years, Marla, and the father of 3 adult sons, and 2 beautiful granddaughters. I am extremely family oriented and am lucky enough to have my parents and siblings living in the same community as me. I have the full support of everyone on this great adventure I will be undertaking this spring. I was born and raised in Rhode Island and grew up in Warwick. I graduated from Bishop Hendricken High School in 1984 and joined the Marine Corps. I met my wife in the Navy Hospital and we were married a year later. When I left the Marines I was a deputy sheriff for a while and then bounced around with various jobs before settling back into commercial fishing and being a seafood wholesaler. Seafood has been good to me! It has gotten me on Good Morning America http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/work-with-me-robin-hand-fishing-industry-12106737?page=1 an I consider Robin to be a dear friend. I have also been on the Hairy Bikers television show on the History channel. I just recently closed my retail seafood store in Summerville so I could concentrate on my prep for the AT. I am still commercially fishing and selling seafood wholesale, but miss my customers dearly. I walk anywhere from 5-10 miles daily and have been doing so for months. I am about 95% done with purchasing my gear for the hike, with cold weather clothing and a few other small items left to get. I will be taking ""practice"" hikes on the Palmetto trail over the next few months and will use them to tweak my gear.  I have enjoyed reading the numerous AT books with AWOL being my favorite, followed by Skywalker and A Walk in the Woods. This is the first journal I have ever tried to keep and I hope that it will read well. Please give me constructive criticism as this is new to me. I plan to dictate notes daily and then transcribe when I hit a hostel or hotel room. I will do practice entries along the Palmetto trail and see how it goes. I have 3 months to work out the logistics of mail drops, and gear issues. So this will conclude my first entry. I hope you will come along with me on my ""Rebirth on the AT""Paul",,my home office,"Nov 09, Mon",7.15
Walkingfish,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517179,"One of the things that I do while walking away the miles in preparation for my AT journey, is listen to audiobooks. I have gone through most of the AT stories. Some I have absolutely loved and one I struggled to finish listening to.   I learned in Bill Bryson's a walk in the woods, that poor preparation leads to a dismal trail hike.   Skywalker taught me about the Virginia blues and how incredibly difficult the whites can be.   AWOL taught me how to walk my own walk , and the importance of getting the right shoes the first time. 5 million steps taught me about the black mud in Vermont, the bugs in Maine , And to not discuss religion with anybody on the trail. All of the stories Have also told me that people drown in the Kennebec River so don't try to ford it. Just some insight that I thought about doing a 7 mile walk today",, things learned from reading trail books ,"Nov 10, Tue",0
Walkingfish,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517337,"I set out today honey crisp 45° morning for 8 mile walk. I normally listen to audiobooks or Pandora while walking and finds it it helps with the boredom. Tip today about halfway through my walk I came to an intersection that is frequented by homeless people looking for money. I didn't see anyone   When I hit the button to change the light, and I was singing yesterday by the Beatles . All of a sudden I hear behind me and old gruff voice singing all my trouble seems so far away… I turned around and there are two old vagrants just singing away. Because I had headphones and I never heard them walk up behind me. It sure gave me a good laugh. The cool weather today sure made me think about hitting the trail in February. Over the next few weeks I will be tackling the southern portion of the Palmetto trail. I will keep you posted.",, interesting observations on today's walk. ,"Nov 14, Sat",0

If it's from admin I'll be happy to delete my account and go elsewhere   Please let the trail name you, as is proper to be considered part of the community. Don't name drop, somehow I feel Robin liking you is a very sick homophobic slur. Hike the trail have fun we all don't need you're dime store novel.","
