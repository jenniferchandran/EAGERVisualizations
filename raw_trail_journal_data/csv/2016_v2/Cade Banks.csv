Cade Banks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507336,"Roughly 2,180 miles.   Yep, this coming spring about March 15th or so that will be me. Walking the entire length of the Appalachian Trail (AT) from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mt. Katahdin in Maine. My name is Cade Banks and I’ve been dreaming about thru-hiking the AT since about 2012 when I was stationed in Afghanistan where I read a book called AWOL on The Appalachian Trail. Funny thing is I’ve always been aware of the AT but never really gave it any thought.You know how when you buy books on Amazon they give you suggestions on what you might like to read. Well I owe my obsession over the AT to Amazon. At the time I was in Afghanistan I was reading books mostly with military themes. I guess because of that Amazon thought I would like a book with AWOL in the title. Turns out that book had nothing at all to do with the military but had everything it needed to fire my imagination for the next four years.Finally, this spring, along with my cousin Meredith, I will be attempting to Thru-hike the entire length of the Appalachian Trail.There, I put it in writing and posted it on the internet. Makes it all official like.Hope to see you down the trail,Cade",,"2,180 Miles","Jul 26, Sun",0
Cade Banks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507440,"So now that that I have given myself over completely to this crazy idea I have to start getting ready, and that means training.Over the last couple years I've been gathering up gear and doing a few hikes here and there but nothing major. Now I have my pack mostly tuned in with only a few remaining things left to purchase (I'll post my gear list later). What I need to do now is start hiking like I have a purpose.Since getting out of the military, I've managed to put on a few pounds more than I should have. The AT is not something you just decide to do one day and go do it. You can try that but you'll probably end up injured and not complete your goal. According to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC), last year 2,250 people set out from Springer Mt, GE. Only 589 of them completed the trek to Mt Katahdin, ME. That's a whopping 26%.In order not to be one of those people who have to give up their dream early due to injury I have made a plan to get in shape for this adventure. I am going to set out each morning and hike. I will do 4 miles for 4 days, then I will do 5 miles for 5 days, and 6 miles for 6 days and so on until I'm doing 10-15 miles a day. Once cooler weather gets here I will try for the 20 mile mark. Not dying of heat stroke is a life long goal.The area around my home isn't great for hiking. We have few trails and you have to travel far to all of them. Walking along a busy farm road with no shoulder is not a good idea either. Walking along a four lane divided highway with a broad shoulder, that'll do. What I'm going to do is park at my sisters house on Hwy 103 West and hike it to the Neches River bridge ten miles away.I'll be using an app on my phone called Gaia GPS to track my progress. Once I figure out how to post that data here, I will. I expect by following this plan I will be able to drop some pounds and tone up my legs. I want to hit a couple long trails over the fall and winter, but that's advanced training. More on that later.Until then, Happy TrailsCade",,The Path to the Path is Surprisingly Straight,"Jul 27, Mon",0
Cade Banks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507672,"I actually had some witty rap lyrics for a title but they quite lewd and inappropriate as rap music tends to be so now your stuck with this boring title :\Today began my first day of training hikes. I headed out at 0600, a full hour later than I intended. I have a lot trouble sleeping, especially if I know I need to get up early for something. The late start meant that my path along Hwy 103 W was busier than it would have been at 0500 but at least the passing trucks made for a nice breeze each time they passed. Of course there was no natural wind. The air was a very still and muggy 75° as is common in East Texas this time of year.Overall I’d say the route and distance I’ve chosen is perfect for the first four days of training hikes. After I finished I felt like I had worked for it but I felt good. I’ve hiked farther and done well at it but this is about building endurance for the long walk and preventing injuries.EDIT: My hiking partner pointed out that I forgot to mention I was hiking with my pack. This morning it weighed just over 20 lbs. I was only carrying 1 1/2 liters of water and about 1/3 the food weight I would have on the AT. I also still have some winter clothing to buy, but I think I will be able to keep my pack real close to 30 lbs. I may be being optimistic but that’s what I’m aiming for.Happy Trails,Cade",,Slow Mileage Escalation,"Jul 29, Wed",0
Cade Banks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508307,"I am actually duplicating this blog over on Wordpress to see which format I like best. Take a look at my blog over there and let me know what you think.Visit my Wordpress Blog Wednesday evening I got a call from my cousin/AT partner, Meredith suggesting that we meet up somewhere to do a training hike together.   It didn’t take much convincing on her part to get me on board. She lives in Illinois, I live in Texas so I suggested we do a portion of the Ozark Trail in the Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri. The drive would be almost equidistant for both of us. After some quick research we decided on hiking 10 miles from the Pomona / Hwy P Trailhead to Blue Hole / Hwy AP Trailhead. As planned this route would have resulted in a 20 mile round trip.Bright and early Thursday morning I got out on the road 10 minutes earlier than expected and made great time getting to Missouri.Entering MissouriSouthern Missouri is absolutely beautiful. It was a very pleasant drive.Meredith pulled into the parking lot of the only store in Pomona, Missouri about three minutes after I did. After getting a cold bottle of water at the store we headed to the trailhead less than a mile away. We got our packs prepared and headed out.The trail started off really nice for about 3/4 of a mile. We saw some wildlife and some neat plants. About this time we started to notice some scattered poison ivy. No big deal right, I expect to find poison ivy in the woods.We had started late in evening around 5 PM. Under the canopy of the forest it was already getting dark even though we had about 3 more hours of daylight. We were planning to just hike in a ways and find a place to camp for the night. The forest had different plans. There were spiders across the trail every few feet. I had to walk while swinging my trekking pole in front of me to keep them off of me. I felt like poor Frodo in Shelob’s cave. The whole forest floor as far as you could see was covered in poison ivy. There was nowhere suitable to set up tents. We figured that had to be just a small local area of poison ivy growth and surely if we hiked on a little farther it would clear up. Wrong! The poison ivy continued like that until the trail bisected a county road at around two miles in. Looking across the road where the trail continued, so did the ivy and spiders. This hiking experience was just miserable. We decided to call it quits for the evening and head back to our vehicles. The road took us to the highway and back to the trailhead.We got back to our vehicles and headed to the closest Walmart in West Plains, Missouri where we both bought a tube of poison ivy wash. We split the cost of a motel room at a Super 8 Motel. After Meredith had her shower I had mine and washed from head to toe with the ivy wash.   I still ended up with a small rash, but she got it worse.We continue our impromptu adventure in the next post.",,View Entry,"Aug 02, Sun",0
