I am prepared: Backpack is loaded and ready, mail drops are filled and dated for shipment, travel arrangements are made, and anticipation is high. Most of all, my wonderful wife has helped me get ready and will be assisting from home with the mail drop shipments.I'm sure many folks will checkout my journal along my hike and I appreciate your interest and comments along the way. But my motivation for starting this journal is to record the events of my hike and let family and friends join in the adventure to some degree.I will end this entry with one of my favorite quotes, ""The world is round, we will get there.""",,Two Weeks to Go,"Apr 18, Mon",0
Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528837,"Today was another purposeful day at work. After work, I continued some final reviews of the trail via the ATC Guides. I am using them to obtain interesting and historical information about sites and places along the trail. I then made notes in the AWOL guidebook pages that I am taking with me on my hike. I plan to read over this information daily and take some time to enjoy some of these places along the way and relay any interesting things I discover to you all thru this journal.On another note, it seems unseasonably warm along the trail right now and everyone is enjoying an extended period without any rain, which is great. I just hope this trend continues in the month of May while I am out there. I am planning for mild temperatures and being from Texas, I do not mind a little hot weather while I hike.My excitement is building and I am more than ready to begin this adventure.Until next time, ""The world is round, and we will get there.""",,Final Trail Reviews,"Apr 19, Tue",0
Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528992,Good Day! I am winding down another day awaiting my great adventure. I still have 11 days to go before my hike begins. I did not do any planning for the hike today but planned another trip this weekend in South Carolina. I hope to hike to a couple of waterfalls in the western part of the state. I think it will give me a small taste of what I will experience on the AT. Get out and enjoy the great outdoors.,,Slowly But Surely,"Apr 20, Wed",0
Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529158,"I do not know if you can over prepare, but I feel like I am there. I have 10 days to go before I begin and I am tired of getting ready.I thought I would describe some of my trail preparations that may help others. I have been planning for almost 2 years. This would include deciding to do this and then researching the many sources out there for your trail gear. My pack weighed in at 34.6 lbs including 4 days of food and 1.5 liters of water. I have pre-bought much of my meals, which include Knorr Pasta and Rice entrees and also Idahoan Potato Packets. I plan to eat granola and breakfast bars for breakfast, tuna packets and Clif bars for lunch, and then boil water for my dinner meals. I hope this works for me, but I will re-evaluate after the first week and make changes as needed. I also have several other sources of food such as jerky, snickers, baby ruths, trail mix, hard candies, drink powders, almonds, etc. I have a one person tent, a 20 degree sleeping bag with liner, a sleeping pad, a rain jacket, 2 sets of hiking clothes (shorts, shirts, socks), 2 bandanas, and wide brim hat with mesquito net. I sprayed my clothes with Permethrin (hope this helps keep the ticks at bay). I am bringing a toothbrush and paste, foot powder, insect spray, wet wipes, and personal medicine as well as acetaminophen and ibuprophen. I have a small first aid kit. I will also bring some electronics (cell phone/camera, Spot G3, sony action video camera, and charger). My cook system consists of the burner that attaches to an iso/pro canister and 16oz cook pot with cup. I will also use hiking poles. I think that is it except for a few other small items, knife, baggies, pack cover, air pillow, seating pad.I hope this is helpful to some and just plain informative to others.Get out there and enjoy the outdoors!",,Over Preparing,"Apr 21, Thu",0
Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529517,"Today was a great day for a hike here in South Carolina. I am here for work, so this weekend I headed to northwest South Carolina, north of Greenville. On the way I stopped and hiked through the Cowpens National Battlefield. The Patriots won a crucial battle at this site against General Tarleton of the British. Very informative and it is hard to imagine the battle that took place so long ago. Afterwards, I travelled on down Hwy 11 past Cleveland, SC and found the side road toward Jones State Park. Before the park you turn on another side road that takes you past a Baptist Camp and to the trailhead for the Fall Creek Falls. It is a 2.4 mile out and back trail, with 1000ft of accent to the falls. The trail was a good trial for my adventures next week on the AT. The falls are over 100ft high and awesome to view. Worth the trip for anyone that lives or happens to visit the area.Get out and enjoy the great outdoors!",,"Fall Creek Falls, SC","Apr 23, Sat",0
Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529708,"Everyone has their fears and mine will be the snakes I encounter on the AT. The snake in my photo was crossing my path yesterday at the Cowpens National Battlefield. Poisonous or not, I do not like snakes and I know they will be prevalent on the trail in the month of May. I hope that my hiking poles will be useful in preventing me accidentally stepping on them as I proceed up the path.About my preparation, because of my navigation history and fascination with geography I am bringing along the ATC maps to review as I progress along the AT. I realize most people would consider this useless information, but I will enjoy looking at the sites and landmarks along the AT. It may also provide some interesting knowledge of stuff to pay attention to as I plan each days hike.I don't think I have mentioned this yet, but I am traveling from Texas to Georgia by auto with my beautiful wife and some great friends from church that are interested in seeing me off. My friends also have privileges at a nice condo in north Georgia to stay in! We will go to Amicalola Falls and enjoy viewing the falls before I begin my hike. I will begin at the Approach Trail because it is the best place for me to begin this journey. I have hiked the area before, in November 2014, when I did the short day hike from Amicalola Falls to the Hike Inn and returned via the Approach Trail back to the Falls.I have just 7 days until my new adventure begins. I will continue to research the trail by reading the ATC Guidebooks and checking out the maps for additional info. The preliminary forecast for beginning the AT next week is for cloudy skies, mild temperatures, and a chance for thunderstorms in the afternoon and evening. I look forward to a great first day!Get out and enjoy the great outdoors!",,My Fear on the Trail,"Apr 24, Sun",0
Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530688,"Well this is it! Tomorrow begins my great journey on the AT. Today we enjoyed the multiple falls at Tallulah Falls in Georgia. I tried not to over do the hiking at these falls but there were numerous steps to get down and up the gorge where these falls are.On the prep side of things I did redo my pack just to check all my gear one last time. Everything is packed and I am ready to go. I hope to get a great nights rest and start my adventure at Amicalola Falls State Park.I want to thank my wife and friends for bringing me to Georgia the last couple of days. We have had fun and life is good!The weather tomorrow appears to be rain. As they say, ""No pain, no rain, no Maine!""Next time I will be talking to you from the trail. I am very excited and my wife is very nervous.Get out there and enjoy the great outdoors!",,This is It,"Apr 30, Sat",0
Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531263,"Day 1 Miles Hiked 10.1 Today my adventure started great. My wife and friends dropped me off at the top of the falls near the lodge. Hiking was strenuous but manageable. Under cloud cover most of the day so that was nice. Passed several folks returning from Springer. Met Jake who would soon be Moose as he passed me up with his quicker pace. I have met a few thru-hikers, all of them young of course because they will need to keep up a hefty daily mileage to reach Katahdin in time. The other hikers I have met were at the shelter. Speaking of the shelter, this one was nice. It has been recently updated and I enjoyed my first stay in the shelter. No rodents and everyone was relatively quite. No one said anything about my snoring either. Back to the fellow hikers, several were from New York City and one guy from Wisconsin and a couple more from Florida. We all hike our own hike so who knows which ones will be with me tomorrow.About my day, I arrived at Springer about 2pm and eat lunch while waiting for my wife and friends to come up to Springer from Big Stamp Gap. They arrived shortly before 3pm and we enjoyed the decent view and took pics. Then we headed north as I was just beginning my hike, which they enjoyed with me. At the parking area we began to hear thunder nearby so we said a nice prayer for my journey and off I went. Just a little ways in it began to rain hard. So I picked up the pace and was soon drenched before I made it to the shelter. Just the way any AT adventure should go with plenty of rain to welcome you. But I am loving it so far.Get out there and enjoy the great outdoors!","Amicalola Falls Lodge

Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531310,"Day 2 Hiking miles 14. The night in the shelter was great, no rodents, and no loud snoring that bothered me. Also, no one said anything about my snoring, so that was good. Got on the trail about 9:30am and it would turn out to be grueling in the end. Got a great picture of these falls along the way and then had two tough climbs up Sassafras and Justus Mtns. Thankfully made it to the shelter and decided to try the tent. Found an excellent site and it was large enough that a father and son from Rome, GA joined. The son is planning a thru-hike and the dad was out with him for the first few days.Got everything set up and dinner was prepared and eaten just in time as it began to rain at 8pm. Everyone socializing at the shelter scrambled for their tents. It continued to rain all night and ended around 7:30am. More about that in tomorrow's journal.Get out there and enjoy the great outdoors!","Stover Creek Shelter

Navigator,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531312,"Day 3 Hiking Miles 16.4I am trying to keep track of my total miles, that is why I am including the miles at the beginning of my post. This is usually due to extra distance travelled to get water, to see a view, or to get to a shelter/place to stay.I awoke to more rain and the tent was a muddy, wet mess. I tried to wipe it off but that did little good. Packed everything up and was hiking at 9:30. The rain had ended and the rest of the day was pretty nice, but it was my longest day and I was hurting at the end. Climbed up Preaching Rock and Blood Mtn today and made it to Blood Mountain Cabins for the night. It was a nice night for resting. They offer hot pizza and do your laundry for you. I worked on cleaning and drying all my gear, as well as myself. Super night in comfort at the end of day 3.The world is round, we will get there.","Gooch Mtn Shelter
