Training Wheels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518525,"Oh boy! My first entry in my trail journal. What an exciting moment! Truthfully I've already written a few entries on my other blog and am debating whether I want to use this platform or stick with my current blog. You can check it out at http://thenotsosecretworldofmollyb.tumblr.com/ Time will tell though.As with any first step into journaling, let me introduce myself. My name is Molly B. I am 25 years old and finishing my Master's in Music Therapy. I'm from Kansas City, MO, lived there my entire life. My mother tells me I am very funny. I have the whole carpe diem thing going for me when it comes to thru-hiking. Single. No house. No job. No pets. No kids (THANK GOD). No real responsibilities. I guess I have a thesis to write (so I can finally graduate), and an $80/month min loan payment. My parents say I need to start making money instead of spending it. I also lose my insurance come mid-July (damn that turning 26 thing) But the time is now. I don't know when else in the next 20 years I can be off the grid with such little consequence. Carpe f***ing diem.The question I get asked a lot (or more like I wish I got asked a lot) is why the A.T.? Why hike? For me it's about fully understanding what I am capable of. Hiking is such a daunting task. It's both physically and mentally a challenge. And I want to know that I am capable of living without all the modern ""necessities."" I want to live life in it's most simple and perhaps most authentic form. But at the heart of it all, I simply want to know that I can. I've been really apprehensive about telling others (outside of my family and close friends) about my decision to hike. There are two types of people I've encountered: 1.) The people who are excited for me and every supportive and 2.) The doubtful incredulous. It's the second group that make me the most apprehensive. I feel like I have to convince them and hate having to defend my decision. I just want everyone to be as excited for me as I am. No... I'm not going to eaten by bears. (I'm much more afraid of mice)",,Just Testing the Blogging Waters,"Dec 19, Sat",0
Training Wheels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518564,"I have the tendency to obsess. Since deciding that I ""might"" want to hike I've obsessed over gear, AT blogs, AT books, hiking books in general. I've probably driven my mother crazy with my ""hmmming"" and ""hawing"" and ""did you knows?"" Today has been me ""obsessing"" over other female blogs on this site. I may have also finished both Cheryl Strayed's ""Wild"" and ""AWOL on the Appalachian Trail"" this weekend. I wasn't really embarrassed about it, until writing it down right now. Then again, I've also watched the entire Season 5 of Downtown Abbey.When not AT obsessing or Downton Abbey watching, I managed to sneak in a hike to the Cascades Falls in Pembroke, VA. Third time is a charm, so they say. I attempted to hike to it twice earlier with a friend but was turned away due to not having exact $3 in change. I'm not entirely sure it was worth the multiple trips. Don't get me wrong, the Falls were cool, especially since it had just snowed. But they're no Niagara (which I should have expected). It was a short and moderately easy hike, 4 miles round trip. And I got in 11k steps. While the Falls were a bit underwhelming, the hike there was both picturesque and enjoyable.However, perhaps I should introduce myself more wholly to my new readers. I briefly went over some basics in my last entry. I tend to forget that other people (other than my mother) might actually read anything I write. This July I began a 6 month sojourn to Roanoke, VA, and thus beginning my first steps towards thru-hikerdom. Now why 6 months? And why Roanoke, you ask? I'm completing my Master's in Music Therapy and an internship is my 2nd to last requirement (the last being writing a thesis). In undergrad, I was getting ""as far as I can from this small town (in MO),"" and ended up in even more rural MO, just a mere 3.5 hrs from home. Going to grad school, I ""could go anywhere in the US"" and ended up even closer than I had been for undergrad at the University of Kansas only 1.5 hrs from home. My internship provided another opportunity to actually get the heck out of Dodge. There's a national roster of internship sites and I was lucky enough to apply and get the position at the Salem VAMC. I've greatly enjoyed working with the Veterans but my end here is rapidly approaching, just 3 weeks before I'm finished. But it was here in Roanoke that I first met the Appalachian Trail. It was one of those things where I first thought, ""Oh that's neat."" Then, ""Oh, I might want to do that."" And it's just grown from there. However, I'm looking forward to hiking back through here. VA has been kind.",,View Entry,"Dec 20, Sun",0
Training Wheels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518716,"When living in Virginia all I want to do is get home to my stuff and my friends and what my life was like 6 months ago. I seem to forget the bad and the challenging parts about being home, the lack of privacy, the occasional anger, the lack of space. While I love being home with the rents, there are certainly challenges. I haven't lived here for a significant period of time since my first summer from college. After that summer I swore I would never do it again. The majority of the year was spent away at school and the summers were spend in Upstate New York, Italy, Philadelphia or wherever I could find my next adventure. As my internship in Virginia comes to a wrap, I'm concerned about this moving home thing. I realized it's only a month and a half until I begin my next adventure but still... And then what? Do I come and stay back at home when I'm finished?Being home also means facing scrutiny of my extended family. You're doing what? Are you sure you have the right sleeping bag? What are you going to eat? And while I realize all of these are important questions (mostly important anyway), I feel like I'm constantly on my toes. It's tough. However, it's also making me confront some serious questions now instead of in the vague ""future."" It probably is important for me to know what I'm going to eat. However, I do like to appear like I know it all... who doesn't?As Christmas rapidly approaches (less than 24 hrs away), I'm hoping Jolly Old St. Nicholas makes a serious gear drop. Happy Holidays!",,Home for the Holidays,"Dec 24, Thu",0
Training Wheels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518880,"I lack the ability to make decisions. Or more closely, I struggle making any decision. A good friend once mentioned that she read an article arguing that our generation struggles making any decisions because we’re constantly shown all the possibilities through social media. If you make one decision, you’re shown all the options that might have existed. If you choose to go back to school, you see all the fun your friends who have money have. If you choose to get married, you see all the fun you could have had had you remained single. I live in fear that each decision I make might be the wrong one. Last night I stood in a pizza shop with one of my friends and couldn’t choose which of the 5 booths I wanted to sit in. I couldn’t choose something simple as a booth… So imagine me picking out gear. It’s a nightmare. I buy something. This is the most perfect sleeping bag for me in the entire world. Then the next thing I know, I’m thinking well… what if that sleeping bag was the most perfect sleeping bag for me in the entire world? Or that sleeping bag? Or that one? Everyone has opinions on the internet. Well… everyone has opinions but especially on the internet. And as they say, hike your own hike which translates to your gear as well. I’m just not sure what gear is The Gear For Me. Santa was incredibly kind to me this year (Thanks Ma!) but I’m still crippled with doubt. There are always better options but what if what I chose was wrong? However, this isn’t just a gear issue, it’s a life issue. 
However, as I write this, I’m sitting in the Charlotte Douglas Airport waiting for my flight back to Lynchburg. New Years brings a whole slew of emotions and doubts. Or it may be that once again I selected a nasty smoothie. Please… never ask me to pick out a smoothie for you. They’re always bad.",,#4,"Dec 31, Thu",0
Training Wheels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519027,"I want to thank everyone that has written in my guestbook for their kind words, especially Marc for telling me to ""quit waffling and make a choice."" Yesterday I put on my big girl panties and took the plunge, both in the sense that I actually bought gear (Fly Creek UL1 (on sale), JetBoil Flash, and shoes) and in the sense that my bank account balance plunged. Being a student and unemployed (40+ hr/week music therapy internships do not pay), I'm still in sticker shock and have sworn off all excess expenses (coffee shops, alcohol, coffee shops, eating out, coffee shops) for the meantime. We'll see how that goes. They don't feed us on the weekends here at the VA.As a side note, REI Garage sales... Wow. Talk about crazy. The REI in Kansas City is fairly new (just a little over 2 years old) and pretty small. However, with the weekend off and nothing better to do, I thought I'd drive the 2 hrs to the REI in Greensboro to check them out. I didn't find anything I NEEDED. But it was an experience.",,#5,"Jan 03, Sun",0
Training Wheels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519567,"I'm a strong believer that things generally happen for a reason. However, that doesn't make an ego bruiser any easier to take. And today was a whopper.Over Christmas, the Murfreesboro VA Medical Center opened a position for a music therapist. It was almost perfect. Near ideal location. Salary and benefits. And I love working with veterans. I really enjoy my work. Getting into the VA system is about as easy as well... I don't know. It's difficult. It seemed like THE moment. So I applied. I told myself I didn't really want it. It was about the experience. If I was meant to get it I would. But telling yourself one thing, and knowing something are two different things. I wanted this job. I wanted to be Molly Bybee, Music Therapist Murfreesboro VAMC. All of this was increasingly more confusing adding in my thru hike. I wanted to hike. And I wanted the job.However, the whole point of this post is things happen for a reason. I found out today that I didn't get the job. I didn't even get referred on, being only ""tentatively"" qualified. But I mean I only applied for the experience right? I shouldn't be upset. I didn't even want the job. However, I'm upset and my ego has taken a beating. I'm good at what I do. I have a stellar resume. And I work hard. And I wasn't even able to get through the door.Good comes from the bad though. My ego probably needed to be taken down a notch. I also feel more set with my decision to thru hike. It's hard to be completely certain when you're on the fence. I wanted both. However... if you know anyone looking to hire a music therapist, I'm your gal... As long as they're hiring after July.",,#6,"Jan 12, Tue",0
Training Wheels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519943,"Thanks to the ""epic"" blizzard that is expected to hit the DC and subsequently Roanoke area this weekend, my stay at the Salem VAMC has abruptly reached its end. Very anti-climatically I might add. I had envisioned there being tears (not on my part) and clients begging me to stay, ""What am I going to do without you Molly?"" ""Music therapy won't be the same."" ""Pleeease don't leave me."" Or very least some ceremony or something. I liked the idea of being crowned Music Therapy Intern Queen. Instead, I gave an enthralling in-service on culture change within nursing facilities and the role music therapy can play (certain to be a very popular topic in AT conversations), said a few goodbyes, discussed my hiking plans with my now former co-workers, and tomorrow I sign out through various departments, giving away what little power I have, and drive South before the snowpocalypse hits.My feelings on leaving are mixed. I'm neither happy nor sad. I will miss the relationships I've created and the feeling of purpose. However, completion of my internship is a huge milestone for me. It's the final hurdle before becoming Molly Bybee, MT-BC which has been my goal since graduating high school (maybe before then). I'm also looking forward to my next adventure.So what's in store for me for the next 6 weeks? After packing everything I own into my small Ford Focus I'm driving to Charlotte to pick my mother up from the airport and we're driving the 14 hrs home to Kansas City (Charlotte was initially supposed to be a layover but with the snow...). If I have my say we'll stop in Asheville along the way. Once home, I'm trying to get in a ton of occupational therapy observations and every doctor appointment imaginable. In July I turn 26 and health care becomes a whole lot more expensive. I plan to finalize my gear and take it on a trial run. And I'd like to spend time and catch up with friends and family. So busy, busy. The 6 months here in Virginia have flown by, so I can only imagine what 6 weeks will be like.",,#7,"Jan 20, Wed",0
Training Wheels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521025,"Forget (mis)adventure, just call me Music Therapist because I can now add that MT-BC (music therapist - board certified) to the end of my name! In case you were wondering, yes, I did destroy my music therapy boards them. Aced them. Annihilated them. Burned them to the ground. Ready for me to stop? My family is. Since I got the notification of a big fat 92% (you only need a 70%) (not even trying to humblebrag here), I've been telling my family how smart I am and how grateful they should be being related to someone so awesome. I'm surprised my head fits in this room. I'm more surprised they haven't killed me yet. Perhaps my father thinks that that would be a poor return on him financing my education. Maybe they love me. Well... hopefully they love me.So what have I been doing since I made the journey from the Old Dominion state? Perhaps not as preparing for my hike as I should. (I hate to admit that one). I have become a full-time thesis writer. It's my hope that the first three chapters (introduction, review of literature, and methodology) are completed, edited, and sent to IRB before I hit the trail. That's like 50+ pages and research... in about a month and a half time... It's really stressful and don't dare care call it a paper. What am I doing my thesis on? ""Occupational oppression with the the field of music therapy."" Specifically I want to know if music therapists experience it, what it looks like, and are more populations susceptible to it. Sure to be a stimulating conversation topic, a thru hiker fave right there. Truthfully I find it interesting. I just wonder if I would be more content if I wasn't aware of the inequalities we experience in our daily lives. I've also been having crisis moments and sending out resumes. I don't really want to work until after August, so it's not a realistic moment to be applying for jobs. I just think I would be more content if I had a semi-plan. I'm a planner. And truthfully I feel a little better after sending them. If someone wants to give me an interview now. Hopefully someones will be willing to give me an interview this fall.However, right now I'm just coasting on the board certification high.",,#8,"Feb 11, Thu",0
Training Wheels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521161,"On this wonderful Valentine’s Day evening, I find myself sitting on the couch with my father watching one the the worst movies ever, Grown Ups 2. He’s spent the entire movie laughing, so that might say more about the quality of movie than anything. Fart jokes, explosive diarrhea, the works. I guess it could be worse. I could be sitting home alone watching multiple rom-coms while eating an entire heart-shaped pizza and crying my eyes out. That has definitely has never happened before...As my departure date rapidly approaches, I’ve been doing a lot thinking and questioning about what I want and why I’m even considering thru-hiking. I also had a dude on Tinder judge me because I’m not a expert hiker. (Seriously dude? you’re on Tinder... On Valentine’s Day. Maybe you shouldn't judge). However, sometimes putting thoughts into words is helpful and if I send it into the inter-verse, someone other than myself is holding me accountable... at least to a degree. And without further ado... My thoughts.I am thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail because...1.) I want to know that I can. Thru-hiking is the ultimate combination of the physical and the mental. For years I was an “I can’t” person when it came to the physically challenging. “I can’t run 5 miles.” “I can’t do a push up.” Rowing changed that for me, well made it better. I still struggle with the mental part of physical challenges. At Bow Ball last year, Jeremy (my rowing coach) made a comment about how I had come to realize how physically capable I was and he was excited to see what physical feats I would accomplish. I want to test that mental toughness and know what I am made of. I know that I’m going to hit breaking points, but the question is will I get past them? Or will they break me?2.) I want to know that I can live without. I have a closet full of clothes that I don’t wear, but I need. A drawer of makeup I haven’t put on since high school, but I need. I need my car. I need my techno gadgets. I need, I need, I need… I am privileged and have so much while others have so little and yet seem content. I want to step away from my stuff and go to basics. I don’t need all of things I think I need. It’s easy to get wrapped up in keeping up with the Joneses. On Facebook this week 3 friends got new vehicles or engaged. I find myself envious. I don’t want to be engaged or have a new car, but how can I keep up being unemployed living at the Casa del Bybee (temporarily of course) What would happen if I quit focuses on objects and started focusing on experiences?3.) I want to know who I am better. Thoreau went into the woods to find himself. But knowing what I am capable of and knowing what I need to be happy, will in turn hopefully solidify the image of who I am. (20-something angst right there) 5.) I have the rest of my life to work. Why am I rushing into the labor force? 6.) When else in the next 30 years will I have less responsibility? No love interest (besides my mother), no job, no house payment, no car payment, no babies, no pets. I am postponing my thesis and paying $80/month in student loans [insert scary noise]7.) Life is short. Take risks. Make poor decisions. Do stupid shit. Create awesome stories.8.) I like the idea of being outdoorsy. (That might be a less suitable reason for hiking).9.) It’s a whole set of skills I’ve yet to acquire.10.) To fill the void that rowing has left. Rowing isn’t always fun. What makes it enjoyable is that we’re doing this terrible workout together.When I successfully thru-hike the Appalachian Trail I will...1.) Fully know what I am capable of. I will know what what will or will not break me.2.) Have lived ~6 months with only what I can carry on my back. Perhaps it will put my need for stuff in perspective.3.) Have the story of a lifetime.4.) Have gained a new level of confidence.5.) Be in fantastic shape. Maybe I can run a marathon without having to really train for a marathon (if a 6 month hike doesn’t count as training)6.) Have a clearer understanding of what I want from life.7.) Have gained a whole new set of skills.8.) Be more authentic.9.) Have seen a great portion of the United States by foot.10.) Apply the skills and experiences gained towards relationships and daily life.11.) Be stronger, independent-er, female-er... Well maybe not female-er12.) Be more appreciative.13.) Have met and created genuine relationships with a wonderful group of people. Perhaps people that I would not otherwise consider getting to know.If I give up on the Appalachian Trail I will...
1.) Be incredibly disappointed in myself.
2.) Not have accomplished everything that I hoped to when setting out on my hike. This is a key point.
3.) Have to explain to every person that knew I was thru-hiking why I didn’t complete my hike when they ask. (embarrassing)
4.) Have allowed my current limits/fears/worries to define what I can accomplish.
5.) Have let the “I can’t” mantra win the mental battle when faced with physical adversities. I’m stronger than that.",,#9,"Feb 14, Sun",0

You know you spend all this time stating that you're going to do something, but actually doing it is a completely different ballgame. But what has happened since my last post?After getting my pack fitted (it was really uncomfortable during my shakedown hike), I learned that I had been told the wrong size and had the wrong size pack. The dream of being an XS for once, just simply was not to be. Talk about stressful. After returning the pack (I didn't buy it from REI and expected there to be a fight), I switched my pack from an Ariel 55L to an Aura 50L. Life is good there.I just have a few small edits to make before I'm officially done with my thesis until my advisor gets it back to me with edits in April. *Insert giant sigh of relief*I made a terrible Youtube video singing about how all my gear is blue (it is though).
