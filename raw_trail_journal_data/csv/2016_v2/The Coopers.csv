The Coopers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522872,"We are just a few days away from starting our journey. The Florida temperatures are supposed to be in the 80's this week. It's going to be a shock to our systems to go to the cooler temps of the mountains. I will be doing a walk this evening in running shorts and shirt, while planning on packing extra clothes for the tricky temperatures on the trail.But I'm looking forward to all of the changes we experience on the trail.It feels good to be lost in the right direction.",,Tricky Temperatures,"Mar 08, Tue",0

On a good note, I received my first trail Angel treat from my boss...a box of Clif crunch bars I've already packed some of them in my food bag. Preparations are in high gear now.It feels good to be lost in the right direction","

I'm stuck between feeling on top of the world getting ready to start this trek to one second from peeing myself from the nervousness of it. Either way I get a warm sensation In addition, my daughter and I cootie-proofed our heads today at the barber shop. It feels good to be lost in the right direction.","

The Coopers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523291,"We left for Amicalola Falls from Jacksonville, Florida this morning. My buddy, Tom, was sitting outside our house waiting to see us off. It was very nice of him to do that.Another friend, Will, was willing to take us us up to Georgia. We are very apreciative of Will taking the time to get us up to the beginning of our journey.We checked in as hikers #597 and #598. After the check-in we took some pics at the arch and the falls. Tomorrow is the BIG day!!!!Thanks to everyone giving us the great comments and we'll wishes.It feels good to be lost in the right direction.","

The Coopers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523409,"Today was our first day on the AT. I have to admit I got a little teary eyed as we walked into the woods. It started out rainy and foggy but later in the day we had enough sun to give me a burn on my newly haircut head. Ariel was in her tent at 6:00 pm to recharge her body for tomorrow. Again,I want to give a thank you to Will. He even did the two mile hike in the rain and fog to the top of Springer Mountain so that he could get a photo of Ariel and me at the beginning.It feels good to be lost in the right direction.","Springer Mountain

Between these mountains was a great place called Cooper's Gap We made it to Gooch Mountain shelter early. Had a little rain while setting up tents. There were about 7 official tents sites, but by the evening there were about 40 tents setup. It was crazy!!Day 3Today started off nice with a Trail Angel serving fruit and pancakes at Gooch Gap. The trail and weather were great. There were nice views all day. We had a second opportunity for Trail Magic at Woody Gap. A couple from Jacksonville were there serving drinks and snacks. Ariel had a Coca Cola and was was chat the rest of the day.","Hawk Mountain

However a college group on spring break from Texas showed up at about six. We couldn't go father because bear cannisters are required in a ten mile section ahead of us. We have bear bags that have to be hung each night, but the bears in the ten mile section ahead must be smarter than the average bear.

The Coopers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523956,"It's been a couple of days since I've been able to update my journal. My cell signal has been weak. We've been having a lot of fun. The views have been tremendous.We officially have trail names now. I am Carrot Stick and Ariel is Possumhead. Mine is because of all of the orange I am wearing and Ariel's hair is fuzzy on top like an opossum.We climbed Blood Mountain a couple of days ago. It was great. The shelter there is the oldest on the entire AT. Again, it's in an area that required bear canisters, so we hiked to the bottom of the mountain at Neels Gap. We rented a cabin Wednesday night and resupplied. Everything was twice the cost of a grocery store.Thursday was Day 5 on the trail. This was the best views of the mountains so far. We walked a ridgeline for a while with views on both sides of us. AT one of the gaps was man sitting to provide Gatorade and soda to us. He was very nice. He even drove up to the next crossing to meet us as we came out of the woods to make sure we filled our water bottles. We made it to Low Gap shelter (MM 43.2) later in the afternoon. THIS WAS OUR FIRST DOUBLE DIGIT MILE DAY OF 11.5 MILES!!!Today was Day 6. The weather was great and terrain was tough the second half of the day. We came out on a roadway at Unicoi Gap before starting a very steep climb to Rocky Mountain top. AT that gap was several people representing different churches from two hours away providing Trail Magic. We had hot dogs, bbq sandwiches, chips, drinks, and oatmeal cakes. They have been coming up for a day for over twenty years doing this for the hikers. It was a great boost to help get us up that mountain! We are at MM 54.3 tonight. Suppose to cool off and get rain tonight. It will be a test of our skills taking down tents in the cold rain and our resolve. I will try to post some photos when I get better cell signal. We hope to go into Hiwassee on Sunday to resupply. I may be able to do it then.It feels good to be lost in the right direction.","

The Coopers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524220,"Day 7 (March 19th)We left Rocky Mountain early in the morning. We had slept at elevation 4017 feet with one other person. It was great being away from the crowds of the other shelters. However, the wind during the night howled like a train. I kept thinking the tents were going to fly away and I would wake up in Oz. I awoke without ruby slippers on my feet, so I knew I was still in GeorgiaAriel took her first fall coming down the mountain. Luckily her trekking poles kept her from falling face first onto the trail.After getting to the bottom of Rocky Mountain we immediately started a long and steep climb up Tray Mountain (from El 3113 ft to 4199 ft). It was tough, but fun at the same time.We continued ups and downs for several miles before having a final steep ascent and descent of Kelly Knob to finish at Deep Creek Shelter (MM 66). This gave us a total of 11.7 miles for the day. These miles may not seem very high, but believe me when I say they are butt kickers in these Georgia mountains. I can see why so many people stop their hike in Georgia.Day 8 (March 20th) FIRST day of springWe woke up this morning to 32 degrees by the watch Ron gave me, our coldest morning yet. Let me tell you that stripping down to nothing to put trail clothes on at this temp is tough. Try not to visualize this, it may be scary. After getting dressed, we had to put up our tents and equipment. My fingers were so numb that I couldn't fasten my backpack clips. I kept having to put my hands in my pockets to warm them.We had planned on a short hike to Dicks Creek Gap (MM 69.6). We had to call from the top Powell Mountain two miles from the gap to schedule someone to pick us up and take us into Hiawassee. We had to call from here because there is no cell service at the gap. We decided to try a shuttle service instead of hitching the 11 miles into town.We got a room at the Holiday Inn Express, then went directly to the Taco Bell to share a Grande Meal (6 tacos and 4 burritos). Afterwards we went into the heated pool to soak our weary bones. I stayed in about an hour and Possumhead was in for over three hours!!Later we went to a country buffet with a few other hikers we met at the hotel. Everyone we've met so far is very nice.I think we are going to spend Monday as a zero day (no miles hiking) for a couple of reasons. First, to rest our bodies after a week of hiking. My knee is a little swollen and I have a few blisters on my footsies. Secondly, it's suppose to get into the twenties with possible snow in the higher elevations. I will admit that I am not ready to experience that weather quite yet.I'm going to put some pics from the past few days in the photo section. Note, there may be more than one pic for each day. When looking at pics, select the day to scroll through photos on that day.It feels good to be lost in the right direction.","

The Coopers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524386,"We spent day 9 getting ready for the next several days ahead of us. The logistics to get supplies bought and bagged, plan stopping points each day, etc. is tiring. So we took a break in the hot tub and pool to help get our minds prepared. Tomorrow morning we are heading back to Dicks Creek Gap to hit the trail.We want to thank everyone for their comments in our Guest Book. It's great to know that so many friends and family are wishing us well.It feels good to be lost in the right direction.","

The Coopers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524830,"We've been back on the trail since Tuesday morning (day 10).Day 10 was a good day. We left Georgia behind as we entered North Carolina. We saw the famous old twisted tree afterward and took a pic. We camped at Muskrat Creek Shelter (MM 81.4).Day 11 was a tough day for us. We woke up to temps in the 20's. So we were slow getting started. It took us a while to hit a groove, then I had my first fall. I was so focused on walking across the slick rocks on Standing Indian Mountain...then WHAM!!!, I'm on my butt. It had to happen some time I suppose. We camped at Carter Gap Shelter (MM 93.9). Day 12 started off better than the previous day. Much better weather and location. Our big item for this day was crossing MM 100 at the top of Albert Mountain. It's weird that in all my research nobody mentioned what killer climb it was to summit this mountain. I guess everyone is so excited to see the fire tower that marks the 100 mile marker that they forget about the grueling climb to get there. It was nice to make it. So we continued hiking and it seemed like the climate changed several times (cold, warm, windy, stormy, gale force storms). We arrived at the shelter where we were planning to camp in the afternoon. However, this location wasn't good. There were no camp sites available. So we continued hiking hoping to find a site to stealth camp. After a couple of miles, we found a spot. The winds were blowing pretty strong, but we were able to get the tents up. And then it hit! It felt like hurricane force winds blowing and hard rain. We weren't able to cook dinner. We were screaming at times to communicate during the storm. Possumhead's tent feel once, but she was able to stabilize it pretty quickly. Our tents continued to bounce for several hours, but we survived.Day 13 was spent hiking to reach Wayah Gap where we were to be picked up by a hostel owner to sleep for the night. During our hike we did summit Siler Bald Mountain. The top of this mountain had a large area with no trees. It was a nice area. We made it to the gap to await our ride. There was a gentleman there offering drinks and fruit. His daughter is thru hiking and he was waiting on her to come to the gap. We were happy to take a mountain dew and banana from him. Our ride came and got us to the goal (Aquanone). It's a very nice place. They provided clean clothes to us so they could clean our hiking clothes. Also we stunk so bad that they use this method to make sure you shower as soon as you arrive. So far we're the only people here. Other folks may arrive later. Supposed to have a big dinner prepared by the owners too. I hope it's good.It feels good to be lost in the right direction.","

The Coopers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524990,"Day 14Today marks our second week on the AT! That's crazy. We spent the day slack packing 13.5 miles from Wayah Gap to Telico Gap. ""Slack Packing"" is hiking with a smaller pack just with the essentials you need for the day. We saw the Wayah Bald stone tower which is about 90 years old. The area is a location that people have been coming to since the 1800's to have Sunday lunches to look over the surrounding mountains. It's a beautiful view. On a clear day you can see Clingman's Dome in the Smoky Mountains.Later we came to an area called Rocky Bald. The views here were pretty good as well.All in all the day was very good. The slack packing with lighter bags sure is a good break from carrying the heavy backpacks. The Aquone hostel owner, Steve/Wiggy, picked us up at Telico Gap and brought us back to our room. Later his wife had fixed a very good dinner; ham, potatoes, dressing, broccoli, and strawberries with cream. A good finish to the day! They've been very nice and helpful. I don't think we will find a place better than this on the AT.It feels good to be lost in the right direction.","

The Coopers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525063,"Day 15Today was Easter Sunday so we slack packed from Telico Gap into the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) at MM 137.3. The day was rainy and foggy, but the temperature was good. At the beginning we met up with a guy we hadn't seen since Neels Gap about ten days ago. That was neat. We hiked into the NOC together. It was good to hear the update of his hiking over the last several days. It took us about an hour climb to get to an observation tower near Wesser Bald. However, the fog kept us from having good views. Even though the views were blocked the hike went well. At the NOC we purchased some necessary supplies for the next couple of days. Then we went to the restaurant next to the river for lunch. After lunch we were picked up and returned to the Aquone Hostel for the evening.

The Coopers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525453,"We have spent the last three days covering some good ground. We have done 29 miles, with today being a short day. I still don't have cell service, but luckily I'm picking up wi-fi from the Fontana Lodge right now. However, it's not good enough to download pics now.Day 16 had us covering from the NOC to Stecoah Gap (13.4 miles). This was a big day. We went southbound to keep from having an agonizing climb out of the NOC. However, we had a descent of over 5,000 ft to around 1,800 ft elevation in about six miles. That was rough on both of our knees, but I believe better than the climb would have been. The total miles for the day was 13.4.Day 17 we left from Stecoah Gap NB toward Fontana Dam. We went through a stretch called Jacobs Ladder... Another doosie of ups and downs. By this time the mileage from the last few days started taking it's toll on both our knees and feetsies. Possumhead has a knee hurting quite a bit, and I have my bad left knee asking me what I expect from it. I don't have a good count of the blisters, let's say a lot and move on Anyway, we went a little over 10 miles and found a good camp site overlooking Fontana lake. It was nice.Day 18 We woke up to clear skies with some wind. A little chilly but not too bad. We packed up and made our way to Fontana Dam (MM 166.3). This was a little over five miles, so it may be considered a nero day (i.e. a day with not many miles). The lake and the dam are impressive. We called for a shuttle to take us to the Fontana Lodge for a rest before starting the Great Smoky Mountains. We will probably take a zero day tomorrow to see if our wounds mend. Also, heavy rains are expected tomorrow and I don't want to start the Smokies in bad weather.

The Coopers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526723,"We are still alive!I apparently have the worst phone carrier to have on the AT. I hardly ever have service on the trail.Day 21, April 2ndWe left Fontana and entered the Smoky Mountains on a cold and windy day. I find it difficult to take pictures on days with cold temps. So I don't have many pics from the last few days. We traveled nearly 12 miles this day in the cold wind. We made it to Mollies Ridge Shelter (MM 177). We spent the night in our first shelter. The other days we have tented outside the shelters. It was a good thing though because the wind blew like crazy all night and the temps dropped in the twenties. Later we found that some tents went down during the night at the previous shelter.Day 22 was spent basically going from one point to the other because the cold temps made it difficult to enjoy most of the scenery. However, we did get some good panoramic views from the top of Rocky Top and Thunderhead mountains which are over 5,500 feet elevations. We ended the day at Derrick Knob Shelter (MM 189). We were in the shelter again. We were fortunate that a couple of guys were there that enjoyed making fire. This shelter had a fire place, so a fire was nice. There was plastic sheeting covering the front of the shelter to help keep the wind out. This campsite was crowded similar to the areas from our first week. There must have been fifty people at this location. The shelter holds twelve people, so everyone else set up tents near bye. I will try to get a pic of an area to show y'all. It's crazy.Day 23 was a very good day. The weather was very good. We did 13.5 miles which included a climb of Climgman's Dome. This is the highest elevation on the entire AT which is over 6,600 feet. Also we crossed the 200 mile mark. Since the weather was good I was able to enjoy many views this day Also at the higher elevations we entered an evergreen forest for the first time. It was very nice. We made it to Mt. Collins shelter (MM 202.8) and set up our tent for the night. We had a few rain sprinkles, but not much. Again this camp area got very crowded. Tents were pitched in areas you thought could not be big enough between the trees. In the Smokies you have to stay in a shelter or tent outside a shelter if it's full. No camping is allowed in any other area. We had been in between bubbles of hikers, but our days in Fontana allowed others to catch us. So now we're in big crowds again.Day 24 We woke up in out tent to very cold temps. Possumhead's water bottles were partially frozen. It was colder than we had expected. Packing up the tent and ground sheet in the cold is not fun. And Possumhead couldn't drink her water either We finally got rolling about 8:30 with intentions to get to Newfound Gap to go into Gatlinburg for a break. Our original plan was to go straight thru the Smokies in six days to get it completed. However, the cold temps had worn us down so we wanted a break. It was only a five mile hike, but the cold makes it seen longer. We had two surprises on the hike. At about three miles we came out adjacent to a road and a husband/wife were there giving snacks and drinks. The lady, Dancer, completed the AT last year and wanted to share some magic with this year's hikers. Later we popped out of the trail at Newfound Gap and right in front of us was a church van with more snacks and drinks for us. These acts of kindness are always a joy to have, but when the weather/temps are bad and you get it, it's doubly good. After snacking we decided to try our luck at hitching a ride into town which is 15 miles away. We weren't having any luck. Then the church providing the snacks also had a van shuttling hikers into town. That van arrived and we were able to get a ride with it.Day 25 has been spent resting and preparing to get back to finish the Smokies. The weather forecast is not too good for the next few days. Up to three inches of snow is expected and temps in the teens are forecasted. This makes you second guess your reasoning to continue hiking. We'll see how it goes.It feels good to be lost in the right direction.","Fontana Dam

The Coopers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527166,"Well we tried getting back on the trail but the swollen knees didn't seem to want to cooperate. So after taking another few days off we have decided to end our journey.Both of us are very sad with this decision. We wanted to go much farther up the trail. However, we don't want to jeopardize permanent damage to either of us. As I had said earlier this was going to be a test to my left knee. The knee has failed the test.Possumhead and I did enjoy our time on the trail together. We appreciated everyone's comments to help us along. It was great having all the folks following us. We do have memories from our journey that we will be able to talk about in the years to come.We will see you guys down the trail.
