Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523673,"This is the year I hope to finally finish the Appalachian Trail.The seed was planted in the late sixties while on family vacation in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. Just off to the left, at the beginning of the paved walkway leading from the parking lot to the top of Clingmans Dome, was a smaller trail. A sign indicated that it led to the Appalachian Trail. I thought it WAS the Appalachian Trail, a misconception I would keep until several years later when I arrived at the tower on Clingmans summit by way of the AT on a hike that had started at Springer Mountain, in Georgia. My mistaken belief aside, that brief encounter with a small dirt path sparked the first thoughts of hiking the Appalachian Trail from one end to the other.I graduated from High School in the spring of 1970, and enlisted in the Air Force that fall. I soon found out that military life didn't agree with me and became a civilian again in April of 1974. Somewhere between entering the service and getting out of it, the idea of a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail progressed from an idle thought to a strong desire.I had not had enough time between finding I was getting out early and my discharge to have any hopes of hiking in 1974. I set my sights on the spring of 1975.I returned home, got a job at Stant Manufacturing, and began saving money and buying gear for the Great Adventure. Most of my reading time was consumed by The Complete Walker, and catalogs from Eastern Mountain Sports and Holubar. There were also publications from the Appalachian Trail Conference (now, Conservancy) with hints and suggestions about hiking the trail and, of course, a complete set of guidebooks and maps. By the first day of 1975 I had all the gear I would need for a thru-hike. I had a lot of gear I wouldn't need as well, but that would take a while to find out.","

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523685,"Before I go any further I need to bring something up about my journal that is inevitable. This is a continuation of a hike that started over 40 years ago. Well over half of it, most of it actually, will be spent hiking sections of the trail that were hiked in either 1975 or 1980. Because of that, I will, no doubt, constantly be mentioning memories of the first time through some sections. There will also be a few “then” and “now” gear comparisons.And this is as good a place to start as any.The journal I kept on the first two hikes were written with a pen in a notebook. Pages were sent home and placed in a loose-leaf binder. This journal, this page of it anyway, is being composed with a wireless keyboard paired with an IPhone. The technology was science fiction on my first two long hikes. On the first hike, one or two people might have read my journal. This time around there is no telling how many will.On both of the previous long hikes I carried a camera that used actual Honest-To-God film. Every mail drop would include pre-paid mailers to a film developer in Chicago. The developed film, in the format of 35mm slides, was sent to my parent’s house, and I got to hear how nice the pictures were when I called home. I didn’t see them myself until I got home. This time the camera is digital, and a tiny little card will store more photographs than a few hundred rolls of conventional film. This time, I will see what I’ve taken before anyone else. One of the reasons for quitting in 1975 was the death of my camera (too low on funds at that point to buy another one) due to the near constant rain in New York. This time, the camera is water proof. I’m not so brash as to say “let the rain come”, but, if, and when it does, it won’t kill the camera.Finally, before getting into actual backpacking gear I must mention the little marvel that is making online journals possible. I refer to myself as a tech dinosaur. I held off even having a cell phone for years, and until acquiring the one I have now, used them strictly for the purpose telephones were invented for. Talking. Now that I have jumped into the 21st century with both feet I’m beginning to see what I’ve been missing out on. Online journal aside, a smartphone is going to make a few things, like paying bills while I’m hiking, much easier than they would have been otherwise.","

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523879,"When I take my first step northbound from Rockfish Gap sometime this May, about half of my gear will be brand new. Most of what isn’t will be on only its second AT hike.I started this game in 1975 with an external frame Kelty BD5 expedition pack. It was huge, and had five external pockets with zippers. Frame and pack together weighed, I think, somewhere between two and three pounds. It is said, that nature abhors a vacuum. This seems to hold true when pack volume is involved as well. Because of this, when I started my first ever long distance hike in 1975 there were several items in my pack that didn’t really need to be there. At least a small part of the blame falls on having a pack with enough capacity to hold it.The pack that I will carry this trip weigh only slightly more than the pack bag did back when. There are no zippers, and, in theory anyway, the three external pockets hold more than the five did on the old Kelty. In actual use, I have found that the side pockets are sometimes reluctant to surrender their contents unless large items like fuel and water bottles are removed first.This one small irritation is offset by the pack weighing slightly over a pound. One way this weight becomes possible is different and, hopefully, better materials. Another way is by a reduction in volume, helping to negate the “nature abhors a vacuum” problem. There is no better way to leave something you don’t really need behind than to not have room in your pack for it.My sleeping bag in 1975, and for several years after, was a Holubar Sawtooth Mountain. It was a zero degree bag, warm in any temperature I ever exposed it to, roomy, and, by today’s standards, borderline heavy. Not Army surplus heavy, but heavy. On this trip I will be carrying a down quilt with a 20 degree rating. As this is being written, 3/18/16, it is the one major piece of equipment I don’t have yet. It is being made to order, and will weigh just over 22oz.","

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523886,"For a lot of people, the word camping is synonymous with the word tent. True, there are also many who will also associate the word camping with a small city of travel trailers, complete with indoor plumbing and electricity. Here, we will confine the discussion to shelters that travel from point A to point B on the back of a hiker.My first backpacking tent was a Browning (the gun company) Sawtooth Mountain (yep, the same model name as my sleeping bag). A glorified pup tent made of nylon instead of canvas. It did what I wanted it to, but on the 1975 hike I was exposed to tents that were better in several respects. It was never used for backpacking after the ’75 hike.The replacement for the Browning tent was a Sierra Designs Starflight. In the years it was my go-to tent of choice I would often remark that a mastery of geometry was helpful in setting it up. All of the angles of the tent and fly aside, I loved that tent. I loved it so much in fact, that it remained in use one hike longer than it should have. After over thirty years of use, it let me down on a re-hike of the AT from Dicks Creek gap in Georgia, to the Nantahala river in North Carolina. The first night out, camping just a little shy of the state line in a torrential downpour, I sadly discovered that the rain fly had acquired the water repellency of burlap. For the remainder of that hike I used shelters.The replacement was an MSR Hubba Hubba. Nice tent, no complaints, but, due to both weight (currently listed at 3lb 7oz) and bulk it will stay behind this trip.In its place will be a Six Moons Lunar Solo, just under two pounds. It is a one pole tent that is designed to use one of the trekking poles as the single pole.Before leaving the subject of tents I want to tell a story about the preparations for the ’75 hike that illustrates how some people are unable to grasp the obsession with weight that is so important to backpacking.The Browning tent came without stakes. In those pre-Internet days it was proving hard to find some lightweight stakes that would work. I mentioned this one day at work and a coworker volunteered a solution.CW. You know what makes good tent stakes? Railroad spikes.Me. I don’t think so, they are way too heavy.CW. Oh, they don’t weigh THAT much. Me. One might not, but I’m going to need eight of them.CW. Well, that’s what I would use.I’ve never weighed a railroad spike, but I suspect that his solution would have weighed about twice what the tent did. In the end, the stakes were homemade from aluminum wire provided (unknown to management do doubt) by a local manufacturing company. I had those stakes until the pack they were in was stolen in a burglary. But that’s another story.","

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524094,"One of biggest differences between the upcoming hike, and hikes I’ve taken in the past, is cooking gear.Like many backpackers who started in the sixties and seventies, my first stove was a Svea 123. It was compact, simple to operate, economical on fuel, and easy to adjust for heat. At full burn, it sounded like a F-4 on afterburners. The Svea was available by itself, or with a small pot and windscreen. Those who bought the Svea without the pot and windscreen would often buy a cook set sold as the Sigg Tourister. This set had a windscreen that was larger than the one sold with the stove, a section to hold the included pots a few inches above the stove, two pots, and a lid that could double as a plate or frying pan. The pots and lid required a device sold as a “pot gripper” to pick them up in use. Ever the one for sales hype, I had one of the Sigg sets.Sometime around the mid-eighties I bought the first of several MSR stoves that used the fuel bottle as a tank. The design made for a light stove, and turned the caps with nozzles for filling Svea style stoves into impossible to find conversation pieces. While not as loud as the Svea, these stoves still made some noise. And then, for several years and reasons, I didn’t do any backpacking.In 2009 I decided it was time to hit the trail again. I decided to do a re-hike from Dicks Creek gap in Georgia to Wesser, NC, a distance of around 55 miles. Before leaving home, I filled my fuel bottle and put the still mostly full can of Coleman fuel on the floor of the backseat so I could offer some free fuel to any thru-hikers that might need some. The first indication that things were being done differently was when I was unable to find any thru-hikers that needed, or for that matter, wanted, Coleman fuel. While there were no doubt, hikers who were still using gas stoves on the trail, all of them that I talked to at Wesser were using alcohol stoves.That hike would turn out to be almost as much of an education as the first month of my ’75 thru-hike attempt. After almost four decades of backpacking I felt as out of place as a flintlock shooter at a machine gun match. There were so many ways of doing things that were different, seemingly better, and lighter.And so. The plans for the upcoming hike involve one small cooking pot, less than half the capacity of the smallest one with the Sigg set, and an alcohol stove. While many, maybe even most, long distance hikers will be using alcohol stoves made at home from pop cans or cat food cans, I will be carrying a mass produced little gem called a Trangia. It has the drawback of weighing more than a pop can stove. However, having played with both kinds while cooking lunch at my wood shop, I feel that I have a little better heat control with the Trangia. There is a need for some kind of pot stand to hold the pot off the stove. Mine is made from half inch hardware cloth and weighs well under an ounce. The windscreen is just another version of the metal foil design used with the MSR stoves.And, alcohol stoves are silent. After the initial “woof” when they are first lit, there is zero noise while cooking.The biggest plus, for me anyway, is that the fuel, Heet fuel additive in the yellow bottle, is available everywhere. I ruined my first Svea burning unleaded gas (back then there was still a choice) because Coleman fuel was unavailable. I remain skeptical about the universal availability of fuel canisters.The cooking set up will feature one item that is a veteran of countless nights and miles.. I will be carrying the green plastic, drinking/measuring cup that was part of my Boy Scout mess kit pre-1965. We’ve been through a lot together.","

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524120,"Not all the then-and-now changes are gear related.In 1975, the first hostel for north-bound hikers was in Hot Springs, NC, roughly 275 trail miles from the start of the AT on Springer mountain. The next one was in Pearisburg, VA, give or take a few steps, 359 miles from Hot Springs. Without even attempting to list all the hostels available to present day hikers, let’s just say that there are a lot more of them. The first is only about thirty miles from the summit of Springer. In the summer of ’75, a question that would-be thru-hikers often asked each other was, “did you read Garvey’s book?”. Ed Garvey, who thru-hiked in 1970, wrote what may be the all-time classic account of a thru-hike, Appalachian Hiker. Included in its pages was a table showing distance between points, locations of springs, and distances from the trail and services of towns along the way. The ATC updated and published the information each year as a “mileage fact sheet”. It was an indispensable item that eventually morphed into the equally indispensable Data Book.But back to Ed Garvey.A longtime member of the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club, Ed enjoyed some perks on his hike that most long distance hikers could only dream of. He was always having pre-arranged meetings along the way where he enjoyed good dinners, rides to town, and a host of other things that were not the norm for an average run-of- the-mill long distance hiker. Graffiti began to appear. On shelter walls and ceilings, right next to Boy Scout troop numbers and “Frodo Lives!”, trail vandals began scrawling “Ed Garvey is a pussy”. He wasn’t, he could out hike others young enough to be his children, (he was 55 at the time of his hike) but he was getting what some perceived as an unfair advantage. Nowadays, quite a few hikers get a lot of the same advantages. So many get it in fact, that it has become part of the overall trail experience and even has a name. Trail Magic.During the peak hiking season, AKA “the bubble”, a hiker can arrive at a road crossing and find someone there with food and a cooler full of cold drinks. Depending on how fast he or she hikes it might even happen more than once in a given day.And, last but not least, there is the task of acquiring information and knowledge that, even if not absolutely required for a successful hike, can make life a little easier. There isn’t a lot to say. Four decades ago there was The Complete Walker, Appalachian Hiker, Backpacker magazine, and a handful of other resources. The Internet has made it possible, through message boards and other web sources, to have any question, no matter how odd or obscure, answered in hours if not minutes. Dylan was right. Times they have a changed.","

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524261,"When I’m reading other hiker’s pre-hike journals, I’m always a little jealous of those who can do conditioning hikes in mountainous areas. Going to the local health club and spending time on elliptical and stair climbing machines is, at best, a poor substitute for climbing and descending steep grades. Where I live, east central Indiana, mountains are just a tad on the scarce side. It isn’t exactly Kansas, but it isn’t Colorado either. For the purposes of elevation, it isn’t even eastern Kentucky. Near the southern edge of the county I live in, the terrain starts to get a little hilly. The county to the south, Franklin, has areas that are probably about as hilly as anywhere in Indiana is going to get. At least, anywhere in Indiana that isn’t several hours driving time. When I started looking for places nearby that could be used for conditioning, I looked to Franklin county.The first place I thought of was the route Indiana 1 takes from its junction with US 52 (which the AT parallels, and then crosses near the I-77 crossing in Virginia) to the crossroads community of Southgate. The highway takes a mile to climb from the bottom of the hill to the top on a moderately steep grade. It’s about as good as I could hope for except….I can see that traffic whizzing by might get a little hairy from time to time. I still want to bring Southgate hill into my training schedule, but I have found another location, a few miles closer and without the traffic, that is almost as good.Franklin County Park.Back when I was a Boy Scout, through a misunderstanding of some kind, a friend of mine and I were the only two members of our troop to show up for a Camporee at the location of Franklin County Park. I think that it’s possible that a few months before the Camporee a discussion took place at a county commissioner’s meeting.Fred: I like the idea of cleaning up the hill above the fair grounds and turning it into a county park, but just doing the initial cleanup and brush clearing is going to cost a fortune.Bob: Hey, why don’t we sponsor a Boy Scout Camporee and get a bunch of kids to do most of it for next to nothing?Fred: That’s a great idea!!!And that, led to my first encounter with what would one day become the present Franklin County Park. Even after almost half a century, I can vividly remember how my thighs felt like they were going to explode going up that hill. Happily, the loop road to the top now follows a route that is not straight up and down, but a few laps up and down is still some better-than-average exercise. Yesterday, a day that turned out to be colder than it seemed when I left home, I drove to the park and did multiple trips up and down the hill. The next trip, I’ll take my GPS so I can know how far it is from bottom to top. I’ll also start carrying the pack so my shoulders and hips can get some training along with my lungs, heart, and legs. Each day the start is getting closer.","

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524435,"Back in my misspent youth I slept directly on the ground. Well, except for the week each year at Boy Scout camp where two guys shared a wall tent on a platform and slept on cots. But any other time I “camped out”, the only thing between me and the ground was my clothing and the sleeping bag.On backpacking trips after I got out of the service, there was always some kind of closed-cell foam pad. It wasn’t so much from a perceived need, as it was that, well, that was the way it was done. Perceived or not, the pads definitely made for better sleeping on the hard wood floors of Appalachian Trail shelters, at least, until Maine. Some of the Maine shelters featured the infamous “baseball bat” floors. Made from small trees growing nearby, each tree/plank would be barked, have the knots from branches more or less shaved smooth, and then nailed to the frame of the shelter next to another, similarly prepared tree/plank. It wasn’t a “The Princess and the Pea” situation. Even a hiker who arrived exhausted from a long day could find it difficult to sleep on such a surface. A simple closed cell foam pad did very little to help the situation.I haven’t seen a shelter in Maine since 1980. Hopefully, they have improved. Sleeping pads definitely have.The pad I have selected for this trip, a Big Agnes Q Core SL, is only around three ounces heavier than a similar sized foam pad. Backpacking gear often involves trade-offs and compromise. In this case, I am trading off convenience and total weight (foam pad) for comfort and packed dimensions (air mattress). Total weight in this case involves the added weight of the pump sack used to fill the mattress. I filled the mattress once by lung power alone. Pump sacks are good. After reading a few less than glowing reviews about the pump sack that would have probably worked perfectly with my mattress, I decided to go with an Exped Scnozzel and do a modification to make it work with the Big Agnes valve. The modification was simple, needing only a ¾ inch PVC street el, a short piece of ¾ I.D. plastic tubing, and a few drops of super glue. Down side, is that the modification weighs more than the sack. It’s worth it.Getting used to sleeping on the mattress might take a little while. After a grand total of one night, I can see that there is going to be a fine line between too much inflation and not enough. A Sleep Number mattress, it is not. Of course, the night that I slept on it was not preceded by a day of climbing and descending mountains on the AT. After that you can sleep almost anywhere. Except maybe, the baseball bat shelter floors in Maine.","

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524791,"For me, there are two reasons for having an online journal. The first is purely personal. After the hike is over, I will have something to refer back to when memories and facts clash with each other.The second, and hopefully more important reason, is that friends and family back in the real world can, from reading daily entries, have some idea of what a long distance hike is really like. And since the majority of those are people who have little or no experience backpacking, I might mention things from time to time that might be less interesting to those who do have some experience with backpacking.It is said, that only one out of four who start from Springer or Katahdin will complete the hike to the other end. The first drop-out I met in 1975 was a girl named Susan. We found ourselves somewhere between Hawk Mountain and Woody gap catching our breath following a steep climb. “Why”, she asked, “do they have to run the trail over the top of every mountain? Why can’t they just run it in the valleys?” It should be noted, that when I met her the first night at the Springer Mountain shelter, she was nearly freezing to death inside her slumber party sleeping bag. It was the night of March 31.Before reaching Woody gap, she would take a dirt road from the trail to Suches, GA and end her hike. She would become a statistic with less than 20 miles of the Appalachian Trail behind her. Susan came woefully unprepared for what she would be facing. Apparently a common reason given by those who quit early, it wasn’t what she was expecting. For this summer’s hike, that is where I have a tiny edge over both Susan and the 1975 me. For the most part, I know exactly what to expect.Frequently over the last few months, when I’ve mentioned my intention to spend three and a half to four months this summer hiking, I have received the same response. “That sounds like fun.” It isn’t. At least, not all the time. Sure, there are breathtaking vistas and sun drenched meadows. But those vistas often come as a reward for a breath-robbing, heart-challenging climb. And it’s quite possible, that the meadow is at the bottom of another one. There will be rain. In a perfect world, just enough to keep the springs flowing, but possibly so much that most of each day, day after day, will be spent walking on a trail that bears a strong resemblance to a creek. Dry, becomes a dreamed of but unattainable condition. If it’s hot, you put a rain cover on your pack and walk without any rain gear, allowing the rain to cool and partially wash you. When it isn’t hot, you don rain gear and hope you have enough on to prevent hypothermia. Hot or cold, after several days of steady or even intermittent rain you have resigned yourself to wearing damp, clammy clothes, 24 hours a day. Sunshine isn’t always that great either. Even when protected by the canopy of trees, the heat can reach a point where you are soaking as much from perspiration as you would be from a steady rain. And, unlike rain, sweating is costing your body the loss of fluids and electrolytes that you need to function. Too much sunshine, and the water sources needed to replace the water you have lost begin to dry up. It can become a real challenge.The list of Other Things That Can Go Wrong is endless. Injury is probably at the top of the list. Following close behind is any number of insect caused maladies and Lyme disease. (Caused by ticks, so not technically insect borne) Far behind is a bad encounter with either of the two venomous snakes that can be found on the AT. So far down the list as to be a non worry, is being attacked by a bear. Murphy’s law being what it is, writing the preceding sentence has probably guaranteed that I will be the first AT hiker to be attacked by a bear.   In summery, getting to spend months on end hiking the Appalachian Trail can be a great experience. But, in all likelihood, along with the great experiences will be times that you wish you were someplace else. Anywhere else. You just have to hope that the good times outweigh the bad.Anyone who begins a long hike on the AT (or any other long trail for that matter) strictly because they think it is going to be fun, is going to be in for a disappointment.","

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525023,"At the risk of offending some folks, I want to start this entry with a movie quote.“Why can’t I worship the Lord in my own way, by praying like Hell on my deathbed?””The statement above, spoken by Homer Simpson in The Simpsons Movie, is very close to the approach I seem to have taken towards conditioning and training for this little jaunt I’m planning. Certainly, for losing the weight that needs to go away before the hike starts.When the decision to go was made in January, I rejoined Anytime Fitness and started almost daily workouts. I weighed around 270 at the time, and honestly believed that I could easily lose 40 pounds before it was time to board Amtrak here in Connersville and head east. There was a good reason to think I could do it. In 1986, I lost 30 pounds in less time to make an end to end bicycle trip on the Blue Ridge Parkway possible. The need at the time was more urgent, because the bike wasn’t designed to carry the combined load it would have had with my pre-loss weight and the camping gear.What I didn’t take into account this time around was that, at 63, I can no longer work out with the intensity I did at 33. On top of that, the starting point was higher. This time around, there were ten more pounds to lose. After countless hours on elliptical machines, and treadmills set at maximum grade, along with shorter periods on a stair climber, the end results as far as weight loss was concerned were dismal. Not zero, but dismal.The problem in a large part, no, make that entirely, is that I have a genuine fondness for food. Maybe not sauerkraut or really spicy things, but just about everything else. And I REALLY like the things that are the biggest taboos for anyone trying to lose weight. As the end of March grew closer I realized that it was time to quit rationalizing every time I felt the need to cheat “just a little”, and get serious about knocking the pounds off. It seems to be working. If the resolve holds – and it has to at this stage – I am on track to be down to at least 240 by the time I start north from Rockfish Gap. It will be less weight loss than I hoped for, but I will still weigh less with the pack on than I did with it off back in January.Weight loss, or, more properly, lack of weight loss, aside, I have benefitted from all those hours in the gym. My stamina has increased as has the overall flexibility of my legs.There are still a lot of non-hiking issues to resolve before I can leave but I’m making progress. The diet problem may get solved by simply not having time to eat.",,It ain't just the pack that needs to lose weight,"Mar 27, Sun",0
Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525607,"The nearest thing to a backpacking trail in my area is a 24 mile loop around the southern part of the Brookville Lake. Comprised of a series of shorter connecting trails on the east side of the lake, and an 11 ½ mile continuous trail on the west side, there is only one thing stopping it from being a premiere destination for weekend backpacking trips. The Indiana DNR steadfastly refuses to allow backcountry camping. It is a rule that many routinely ignore. One person even has a YouTube video showing the highlights of a two night trip on the trail complete with nightly campfires. Still, to avoid any conflict with a Conservation Officer, I prefer hiking short sections and going home every night.Saturday was a perfect day for a little stroll on part of the Adena Trace. I chose to do a two mile section called the Eagle Trail, do the short road walk between the end of the Eagle Trail and the next section, and a mile or so of the next section, known as the Woodland Trail. Round trip total was something over six miles. It wasn’t long enough to qualify as a conditioning hike, but before it was finished I knew I was using a few muscles that were not getting used in the gym workouts.   Although they were nowhere near their peak, wild flowers were blooming in abundance. The ground underfoot was soupy in a few low places, but overall the trail surface was almost perfect. The condition of the ground was especially appreciated on the return leg, when my right toe caught a root and the rest of my body had a sudden and rapid meeting with the earth. Thank God, it wasn’t Pennsylvania, because it probably would have cracked my skull. The first item of concern was if either of my trekking poles were bent as a result of the fall. It’s important to keep priorities in order. For the record, the trekking poles were fine.The highlight, aside from the beautiful weather and clean spring smell of the woods, was all of the white Adder’s Tongue, or Trout Lilly. I am used to seeing the flower with yellow blossoms, so seeing white ones was something different. There were even a few early Virginia Blue Bells.The list of things that need to be taken care of before I can leave has gotten shorter, but is still longer than I would like at this point. Getting them out of the way will have to take precedence over actual hiking instead of trips to the gym after it gets dark. I had really hoped for a weekend (at least) of backpacking before taking off, but have resigned myself to the fact it most likely will not happen. I’m okay with that. I know my equipment. If I can just take it easy for a week or two, I can OJT my body to the idea of spending the majority of the day in forward motion.",,Spring on the Adena Trace,"Mar 31, Thu",0
Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526503,"Yesterday I got the Guthook app for my IPhone. It's made me think back (here we go again)to the maps and guidebooks that just about everyone used for decades.Let me start out by saying that I hate the current format of ATC guidebooks. The only full set of guidebooks I ever had were the ones for the '75 hike. All of them had two separate sets of directions for each section as opposed to the current method of having S-N on one side of a page and N-S on the other. The best ones, Georgia, NC/TN, VA, and Maine were made so that you could take them apart and only carry the pages you needed. The map sets with the those guide books ranged from good ones with contour lines to crude ones that looked like they were drawn on a napkin in a bar at one in the morning. As best I can remember, none had elevation profiles.In the comfort of a recliner at home, I am impressed with the Guthook app. In the years the trail route was in constant flux due to unavoidable reroutes, guide books were often (usually?)out of date before they were published. Through the wonder of technology, it is now possible to have daily, if not hourly trail updates on some of the critical items like water sources. Anybody using the Guthook app - and as I understand it, there are quite a few, can tap on icons for things like a spring and update information on it. For many years, this kind of information could be found only in shelter registers. Registers have always been THE source of communication for long distance hikers but that is changing in the world of cell phones.Electronics are not perfect of course. In all probability, the Inchworm tragedy in Maine would not have occurred if cell coverage was universal. She would have been able to call for help. In the case of the Guthook app I don't need a signal, so as far as using it for a map is concerned it should be fine.    I will be carrying paper as well. The AWOL guide and map sets will weigh but a fraction of what the old guide books and maps did. The scale of the maps is dismally small. However, coupled with two different apps on the IPhone, I'm hoping that I won't spend quite as much time this summer trying to figure out what happened to the white blazes.

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526782,"Yesterday I made what I hope will be the last trip to REI before I leave for Virginia. I feel lucky to have two REI stores fairly close by because they are not identical. Close, but not identical.Yesterday it was the store in Indianapolis.I needed some line tensioners for the tent, and a tube of seam sealer for Sil-Nylon. I have yet to set the tent up to my satisfaction – the “bathtub” floor always ends up mostly flat. While playing with it again Tuesday I tried adding two guy lines, hence the need for the tensioners, and noticed that I missed one of the attachment points for the extra lines when I sealed the seams initially. I also wanted to get a small dry bag for the battery charger and a few other electronics related items.I have never used a hydration bladder, but since the pack I have is set up to use one I purchased one of those as well, along with an accessory kit for the Sawyer filter. It looks like the bladder might have to stay behind because things are going to be packed so tight there might not be room.As I am writing this, my pack is hanging from a scales nearby. With the tent, quilt, sleeping pad, cooking gear, all of the clothes I would be carrying on a “good” day, in other words the rain gear and cold temperature items, and a few other miscellaneous items, the scale is showing just over fifteen pounds. There might be another two pounds at the most that will be added in gear. On one hand, I guess I should be happy that it is about as light a pre- water and food load as I have ever carried. On the other hand though, I was hoping it would be a few pounds less. This is where the fun starts. So far, weighing (literally WEIGHING, like on a small digital scales) alternatives to first choices hasn’t worked out too well because – and this has kind of surprised me – the first choices are all coming up an ounce or more lighter than the alternatives. In the one case where I know I could save a few, only a few, ounces, my sleeping pad, it would compromise the efficiency of my quilt. Added to the problem is that the just over fifteen pounds I have now will increase considerably when the tent and maybe some other things get wet. And they will.I had planned to make Front Royal my first resupply. I may have to alter that plan and use Luray instead. It will depend a lot on what is available in Shenandoah National Park in the way of camp stores and places to buy prepared meals. Starting out, I really want to keep the pack under 25 pounds if at all possible, and it won’t be with eight days worth of food.","

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527049,"The hike this summer is only possible because I was no longer able to stand another day working for my former employer. I had, for the last two or three years, become increasingly unhappy even being associated with the company. The final straw came on July 24, 2016. It occurred the first thing on a Friday morning. I left the office in a state of seething rage, ran a few quick jobs that I could do without waking up any customers, and then drove back to the office and told the district manager to put me down for two weeks vacation starting the following Monday. The Sunday evening before I was to return to work, I went to the office and left a more-polite-than-I wanted-it-to-be, letter of resignation on the managers desk, along with all my company keys and ID. For the first time in 23 years, I was unemployed. Initially I had planned to get another full time job and work for a few more years. However, with so much idle time to think about my options I realized something. Several friends from school days hadn’t even made it to 60, much less 66. Social Security was available to me and I might as well take it while I was, as they say, on the right side of the sod. The monthly check would be more than enough to finance a hike. Thoughts of a summer in the mountains began to emerge.After all other problems of being gone for four or so months had been solved there was only one big one remaining. When to start. For most people it wouldn’t be that big of a deal. For me, the problem went back to my last employer.The company had dissolved the old pension plan, replacing it with a 401K, and funds from the plan were to be dispersed in cash pay-outs. Until yesterday I thought that I would have to be available to personally deposit the bulk of my share in an IRA and cash the check for the percentage I was taking for immediate cash. I now know that neither will be necessary. It has been a major concern, because an early mailing said that everything would be distributed “by” May 17 and a later mailing said “on” May 17. Going with the information in the first mailing I had already bought my train ticket and made reservations in a Charlottesville motel for the 18th. I thought I would have to cancel and reschedule. Now I know that it will not be a problem. Yesterday I bought the food for the first week. Sometime in the near future I will try to make arrangements for someone to drop me off at one end of the Wolf Creek section of the Adena Trace so I can see what the pack feels like after about 12 miles of walking. Now that everything is really starting to come together an excitement that has been surprisingly absent is starting to build.",,View Entry,"Apr 09, Sat",0
Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527551,"One piece of gear that I bought with no intention of ever taking is suspended by a short piece of rope that hangs from the same rod the shower curtains around my lathe hangs from. The digital scales, sold to weigh fish, are proving helpful, and, just a little educational, as the final decisions of what to take and what to leave behind are being made.When I weighed the pack with 98% of what I planned on taking, sans fuel and water, the scales showed just a tad over 16 pounds. At that point, I thought that 25 pounds total would be easily attainable. I was wrong. Loaded complete for the planned first week from Rockfish gap to Front Royal the weight came to a bit under 30 pounds. This would still be the lightest load I have ever carried with a week’s worth of food, and it is under the pack’s (Hyperlight Mountain Gear Southwest 3400) maximum recommended load, but I’ m hoping to find some way of getting it down a little more. I can cut the amount of fuel I am carrying in half to 12 oz. Maybe leave the small jar of peanut butter behind?? Nah, let’s not get crazy here. Long before lightweight and ultra-lightweight backpacking became as common as it is now, I met my first ultra-light backpacker at the Rock Gap shelter in North Carolina. It was early morning, and while it wasn’t terribly cold, it wasn’t warm either. As a group of us were standing around talking before we pushed on, a young guy stumbled into the shelter wearing nothing above his waist but a cotton tee shirt. Whatever gear he was carrying was inside an incredibly small canvas pack with shoulder straps as the only suspension system. As everyone else present was carrying carrying much heavier loads in external frame backpacks, someone must have said something about how little gear he had. It’s been decades (38 years to be exact) but I still remember his reply. “I decided that I could walk comfortable or sleep comfortable. I decided to walk comfortable.” This, as I understand it, is the basic premise of ultra-light backpacking. Accept a degree of discomfort from time to time in exchange for less weight on your back.I can do this to a degree, but not to the point of putting myself in potential danger from hypothermia. Hence, the first and last months of a planned four month hike will feature a slightly heavier pack with a few cold weather items that won’t be needed in July and August. If past experience is any indication, after a week or so even thirty pounds will feel like next to nothing.","

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528642,"D-Day is a month away.By the time another 10:00 P.M. On the 18th of a month arrives I should be in a Holiday Inn close to I-64 in Charlottesville, VA. Yesterday I drove to South Gate hill south of Brookville, IN. It offers a mile long climb on a moderately steep grade, and is as close to mountain hiking as anything available for training in my area. After three trips up and three trips down I called it a day (didn’t start until early afternoon) and started home.Normally when traveling from Brookville to Connersville, I use IN 1. Yesterday, just for a change of scenery, I turned left at the north end of Brookville and took US 52 instead. Not long after turning onto 52 I realized I would be passing a short section of the Whitewater Canal Trail that I had never walked before. It was a beautiful afternoon so I decided to add another mile and a half to the day. The Whitewater Canal was built between 1836 and 1847, running 76 miles from Hagerstown, IN to Harrison, OH. By the time it was finished, railroads were already replacing canals as a means of transportation. It was only a few years before tracks were laid on what had been the canal’s towpath. Not all that many years ago the tracks ran from Cincinnati to Connersville and points north. A flood in the 1970s washed out a section of track between Brookville and the little town of Metamora and most of the tracks between those two points were removed. Part of the old roadbed is now used in two separate areas for the Whitewater Canal Trail. As might be expected since it on an old railroad route, the trail is easy walking. As in flat. But there are some interesting things to see.In its 76 miles of length, the canal dropped 491 feet. This required a lot of locks along the way, and the remains of many of them are still visible today. Near the parking area for the section I walked yesterday, were the remains of the Yellow Bank lock. There would have had to have been an aqueduct right before the lock, and remnants of its foundation are still visible. What was really interesting was that the north side of the lock was not supported by surrounding terrain. It is amazing that such a free standing structure is still basically intact.As far as I know, there is only one lock that is still operable. Part of the Whitewater Canal Memorial, it is located near Metamora on US 52. Directly across the road is the Hearthstone Restaurant. The Restaurant was used s one of the locations for shooting the movie Rain Man.","

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532999,"I’m less than a week away from being back with the trail. For the most part, we have been friends for 41 years. It will be good to see it again.Some of the things I had hoped to accomplish before leaving haven’t happened. At the top of the list is losing weight. This will make things a little harder at the start, but I’m hoping that walking slower and longer will get me past the first few weeks until everything comes together. If I complete the hike I should be returning home around 60 pounds lighter than I left.Of less concern is not doing (at least) an overnight shakedown hike. Most of my gear has already been tried so this is really a non-issue. With one exception – in that case it isn’t available – all of my monthly bills are set up for online payment and I am able to do all the banking tasks from my phone.All of the things that will be mailed to me along the way are packed, stamped, and addressed. Among those items are two sets of clothes that have been soak treated in Permethrin. If everything works out right I will be getting each set of clothes just about the time when the current set is losing effectiveness.Later today I will go through what I plan to take a few more times and decide what has to come along and what can be left behind. I’m still shooting for a fully loaded, gear, food, water, and fuel weight of 25 pounds. It may end up meaning a short supply trip before getting all the way through Shenandoah National Park. As I am writing this, the weather forecast for Tuesday is rain. The train will actually arrive at Connersville’s Amtrak station (assuming it is running on time) at 1:21 A.M. Wednesday. However, it is about a 40 minute walk from the house and I don’t want to cut things too close. I may get to try out my rain gear getting to the train station.Monday is supposed to be nice so I’m planning a few trips up and down Southgate hill with a fully loaded pack. Tuesday, I will put in an hour or two at Anytime Fitness, and then freeze my membership for three months. (All that’s allowed) After that it will simply be a matter of waiting for midnight or so to arrive, shoulder my pack, and walk to the train station.I will be as ready as I’m going to be.","

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533905,"The talking and speculation is over. It isn't ""the rubber meets the road"", it's ""the Vibram meets the dirt"". Or rocks. Or mud. I am starting with a pack that is a little heavier than I'd hoped, but that is mostly food weight. It will keep getting lighter until the cycle repeats itself and it get heavier again. It is still, by far, the lightest pack I have ever started with being right at 30 pounds.As you an see by the day's mileage, I am taking it VERY easy or the first day. The rest of he first week will need to be in the neighborhood of 13 +. After that, rings should start to get easier.When I make my next post, it will be from the trail.Added to the entry at the motel this morning:All in all day one didn’t go too bad.I ended up hiring a taxi to get me to Rockfish Gap because not only did I have no luck thumbing on the on ramp to I-64, about every twentieth car though the intersection was a police car. I expected every one of them to stop and hassle me.I finally started hiking around ten. It was surprisingly cold at Rockfish Gap and I wasn’t sure that I was wearing enough. About two hours later though I was able to shed the wind/rain jacket and kept it off the rest of the day. The trail was relatively easy with no major climbs or descents and I made good time. At least, good time for someone who is out of shape and overweight. Toward the end of the day my legs and feet started hurting a little bit from the abuse I was giving them, and I had to stop a few times to rest because of it. I finally reached the shelter around 3:30. It took another half hour or so before I felt like backtracking to the spring for water.Tomorrow will be harder if for no other reason than it will be about five miles longer. Tonight I may regret the decision to start with the summer weight quilt. There is a good chance I will be wearing the down jacket, wind jacket, and Balaclava. Oh well. It might provide incentive for a pre-dawn start.","Holiday Inn Charlottesville

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534707,"Day two started out well.After a chilly night with my summer quilt keeping me comfortably warm, I did the usual morning chores and hit the trail with one liter of water. I reached the official beginning of SNP shortly afterwards where I took a quick break to remove the long sleeve under-layer I was wearing and take a picture of my pack and poles leaning against the concrete post marking the location.A pleasant climb on good trail, followed by a gentle descent, brought me to the first crossing of the Skyline Drive, complete with an overlook. I took a break, and before leaving met another just starting long distance section hiker whose trail name is G Man. (I don’t have a trail name and have no intention of having one) Before we left we got some of that famous “trail magic”when a man pulled into the parking lot with free food and drinks. We both refused the food but accepted the drinks. Mine was a regular non-diet coke, the first I have had in years.G Man and I started out together but he soon pulled ahead. And, my day started going south. I found myself with a complete lack of energy. The slightest uphill was like a 20% grade. I needed frequent and long pack off laying down breaks. Late in the afternoon, out of water and too many miles from the next source – the shelter I was heading for, I reached another crossing of Skyline Drive and made a decision. Instead of taking the AT to Blackrock Gap, just .7 from the shelter, I would walk the Skyline drive instead. It was a good decision because the road was all level or down hill. Had I tried reaching the shelter by way of the trail I seriously doubt I would have made it. As it was, it was after seven before I got there. After two laying down breaks on the final moderate .7 mile. I rehydrated and had supper. On the plus side, the cramps and soreness of night #1 never made an appearance.It rained and got much colder during the night. I will probably do a shorter day than originally planned and stop when I reach Loft Mountain Campground about six miles away. It will throw my whole schedule out of whack. It wouldn't make that much difference if I wasn’t carrying a permit that says where I am supposed to be each night. One nice things about the campgrounds in the availability of food.

The trail skirted the summit of Blackrock, and on a good day there would have been some great views. On this day, with visibility measured in yards, there wasn’t much to see. Because the day before took so much out of me I decided to make day three an easy 7.4 miles (or close to that anyway) to Loft Mountain Camp Ground. It was a day with plenty of breaks, ending for about one hour and a half at the camp store where I filled up with salty potato chips and two bottles of Gatorade to replace some of the electrolytes I’ve lost. I also took advantage of my time there to recharge the phone so I could save the battery charger for another time.As far as the day’s hike went, it was often chilly and always foggy. It didn’t actually rain much, but every breeze brought rain from the leaves above. I saw three deer that allowed me to get very close, a rabbit that I almost had to kick out of the way, and several bear scat.Bear are common enough that my tent site is equipped with a bear proof box to store food. I enjoyed seeing a sign in the comfort station warning not to put any food in the waste can because,”bears will come in after it and will be unable to get out”. Can you imagine the rush of entering a public restroom and finding a bear that has been trapped there for a few hours?Another short one is planed for tomorrow.

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534710,"Day four started with more fog and a wet tent. There are few things more depressing than a lightweight tent that has taken on weight from being wet. To add to the problem, the space that was leveled and bordered for setting the tent up didn’t allow for proper set up (it would have worked fine for a free-standing tent) and condensation problems made it wet on the inside as well as the outside. I was able to shake off a lot of the water on the outside, but I am going to have to wait for a sunny day to erect the tent and dry it out. With other tents I’ve owned there was always a separate waterproof fly. This will be my first experience drying out a single wall tent. I predict an education. It will be a while. Rain is in the forecast for the next three days. Did I mention that it is cold as well?I returned to the camp store before leaving to supplement my usual meager breakfast with milk and a small package of smoked ham. I also purchased a block of Cheddar cheese to snack on during the day.Things went sour briefly when I took the wrong trail away from the store and found myself about half a mile past the AT. Consulting a map at the Loft Mountain Wayside I saw what I had to do and was back on the trail about 20 minutes later.Today I finally saw burned areas, the result of a 10,000 forest fire that was raging about a month ago. Some areas were not too bad. The first area I saw actually stopped at the edge of the AT, just like it had been intended as a fire break. Other area were much worse, resembling pictures of no man’s land in WW I. Regretfully, I was unable to get any pictures of the worst areas because at the time I was walking in a downpour.I arrived at the Pinefield Hut around one o’clock and settled in. As I write this, around four-thirty in the afternoon, it is chilly bordering on cold. Since three or so the sun has appeared, disappeared, appeared again and disappeared again.

It wasn’t actually raining, but the sky was overcast and it looked like it could start pouring any second. I left the shelter dressed for rain, and planning on a short 7.8 mile day to the next shelter, Hightop Hut. Shortly before reaching the Skyline Drive crossing in Powell Gap, I came to an rock outcropping that offered a good view of Powell valley as well as a section of Skyline Drive. At the time, the sun was actually shining, so for once there was something to see besides fog.After several full-fledged breaks and countless lean-on-the-trekking-poles-and-catch-my-breath breaks, I finally reached Hightop Hut. I went to the spring and filtered a few liters of water along with a full two liter “dirty” bag. It was way too early to fix dinner, but I opened the food bag to see what was available. That is when I realized how low I was on just about everything. There was an immediate change of plans.I decided to hike to Swift Run Gap and hitch into Elkton,VA for a quick resupply. This would bring the day’s mileage total to 11.6. It would also necessitate a stay in a motel since I couldn’t possibly get back to the trail soon enough to make it to any shelter or campground. Sometimes you just have to make sacrifices.I lucked out with a ride in a matter of minutes that took me straight to a Food Lion. Across the parking lot was a Burger King. I had to eat before thumbing eastward to a motel, so that worked out well.It took a little longer to get a ride east, but the young guy (who was perfectly sober, even if he was drinking a beer while he drove) couldn’t have been nicer. When every motel in the area turned out to be booked solid, he drove me back up to the park and dropped me off right next to the trail head.And so….

The idea worked, but around four AM I woke to the sound of rain. I quickly closed the flap, zipping it together with its mate, and resigned myself to a wet tent.Luckily, the rain only lasted a few minutes. It had been allowed to air long enough that when morning arrived with a clear sky I had a throughly dry tent.The unexpected change in plans the day before that went from staying at Hightop Hut, to going into Elkton to resupply and spending the night in a motel, and finally, because no motel was available, to going to Elkton to resupply and then returning to the trail, had created a small problem. Before I could start walking I had to repackage all the supplies I’d bought the afternoon before. Normally, when a hiker knows that he or she is getting right back on the trail this is done at the store. Since my original plan had been to stay the night at a motel, I had intended to do the repacking there.

With all the other breaking camp chores taken care of, I lowered the food bag from where it had been hung the night before and set about getting everything to where it would fit in the pack. By ripping up all of the cardboard boxes I was able to fit it all in. Walking started around 7:30. The day started as they so often do when hiking. Uphill. The first climb of the day went fairly well, and I had knocked off an uphill mile before I knew it. While taking a quick break to shed my long sleeve under layer I was gifted with a glimpse of a Scarlet Tanger, only the fourth or fifth one I have ever seen. Once the trail started down again it was easy walking to the South River picnic area where I took a long break and lightened the weight of my food sack a little.I then began a long but gentle climb to the top of Baldface Mountain. For hikers with a few months of the trail behind them, the climb would be hardly noticeable. At that point, I had less than a week, and it just about did me in.

It could end up causing a few problems on day eight (the day I had originally planed to exit the Park) but there were reasons beyond the way I felt physically for stopping there.It was the ONLY camping spot I remembered from my 1975 trip through the Park. Angus White and I shared my tent and rigged a pack poncho for a vestibule so we could cook in a downpour. There was a man in a nearby spot that allowed us to stow our food and packs in his pickup so we didn’t have to mess with hanging them.Things have changed. All campsites are now equipped with bear proof storage boxes, and, as far as I can tell anyway, tent campers and trailers are separated.Before leaving the shelter this morning, a doe wandered to within fifteen feet of the shelter while several hikers were having breakfast. She acted curious about what we were doing and never displayed any fear before wandering leisurely away.The day started out well, even though it involved a climb to near the summit of Bearfence Mountain. I made the best time I have made on this hike to a Skyline Drive parking area at Bootens Gap. At that point I was only five miles from my intended stopping point and, once again I faded. About half-way up the grade leaving the gap I took a long take-off-the-pack-and-lay-down-awhile break. For the remainder of the hill I took several leaning on my trekking poles and sitting on logs breaks. Once the top was reached it was downhill and level for around two miles until reaching Milam Gap. From there, it was about a mile of mostly level to slightly uphill trail to a short trail that led to Skyline Drive and, .2 of a mile later, Big Meadows Wayside. Once there, I treated myself to two Cokes, a package of lunch meat, and a bag of potato chips. (calories, salt) After a long stay at the Wayside I finally hoisted my pack and started the almost mile long trek to the campground on a paved, mostly level trail.The ranger at the registration building suggested that I check out the sites available to decide for myself which one I wanted. While doing so, I dropped the Ziplock bag containing my Data book, guide, and maps covering the trail well into PA. If I had realized it when I did it, it wouldn’t have been worth mentioning. As it was, after discovering the bag was missing I had some anxious moments (actually a little over an hour) until I found it again.Tomorrow will either be really short or really long. At this point, I don’t know. It is one of the advantages of a long hike over a section hike. You can afford to take it slow until you are ready for the long days.","Bearfence Mountain hut

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535228,"I started out the second week of the hike with an unusual kind of decision to make. There were two choices. 1, eat my regular blah breakfast consisting of oatmeal, peanut butter and crackers, and hot chocolate, and be back on the trail quickly or, 2, walk the mile back to the Wayside, have a real breakfast (while possibly offending others with my week’s worth of hiker funk) and then walk another mile back to the campground before I could officially start the day’s hiking. There was probably never any doubt. Food wins every time.I got to the Wayside about a quarter to eight only to find that it would not be open for another fifteen minutes. While sitting at one of the picnic tables waiting, another hiker (from New Zealand – people come a long way to walk the AT) showed up. More people arrived in cars, and one of them, Larry, a Potomac Appalachian Trail Club Maintainer, walked up and offered to buy us breakfast! The gentleman from New Zealand declined, as he was only interested in getting a few things and moving on. I said I didn’t feel right about accepting because I wasn’t really a thru-hiker. The gentleman insisted, and so I got to start my day out with a free (and, I might add, excellent) breakfast. I didn’t take my first official step on the trail until 9:35, but I had already walked more than two miles.Not long after getting back on the trail I passed the New Zealander taking a break. Soon afterwards, I was passed by a woman who I think was another online journalist, Bunkie. There was no chance to ask. She pulled away at such a speed that I might as well have been standing still. Not long after her, there were three twenty-something young ladies who, while not quite as fast, vanished from view in a minute or two. Near the end of the steepest part of the first climb I was passed by the only hiker I had passed – because he was sitting still at the moment.Actually, I was doing pretty well for me, and it al had to do with terrain. Not that it was easy exactly, but it was steep up on the right side of the trail and VERY steep down on the left. I needed to get to where more gradual slopes to the side would allow me to get a little ways away from the trail and play with my cat hole trowel. I was hoping to make the first shelter at the five mile mark and use the privy, but urgency and opportunity won out. I had just returned to my pack from my foray into the woods when I was passed again by a woman thru-hiker (Virginia Creeper) who was slack-packing the park with her daughter.Not long after, I came to the side trail to Rock Springs Hut where I took a quick break for a snack and to top off my water bottle. While sitting at the table in front of the shelter two guys went past on their way to the spring. They were part of a threesome that I would leap-frog with the rest of the day before they pulled ahead for good late in the afternoon. As an aside, the spring at Rock Spring hut is shared by a nearby, lockable cabin that looked like it would be a great place to spend a few days. The spring itself was ice cold and scored a solid ten out of ten.After passing the side trail to Rock Spring, the AT got a little rougher, often rocky, and at one point crossing a scree field that I personally found a little scary. I also started to enter into my daily crash.The hoped for destination when I started had been Byrds Nest # 3 shelter. Late in the day I realized that I had figured the mileage wrong and that it was four miles farther than I thought. The result was my calling it a day at Skyland Lodge where I could look forward to a shower, a good supper, and a good breakfast. One of the evening chores was washing my socks and underwear (there is a clean pair of “town only” briefs in the dry sack that stays at the bottom of the pack) in the sink, for which I am sure I will earn the undying animosity of the maid service.I realized this morning that my mileage isn’t showing up right on the daily entries. I am currently a shade over seventy miles into the hike, and the shelter spacing will allow nice ten miles days until I leave the Park (hopefully) three days from now. Four days behind schedule, but improving every day. I started out the second week of the hike with an unusual kind of decision to make. There were two choices. 1, eat my regular blah breakfast consisting of oatmeal, peanut butter and crackers, and hot chocolate, and be back on the trail quickly or, 2, walk the mile back to the Wayside, have a real breakfast (while possibly offending others with my week’s worth of hiker funk) and then walk another mile back to the campground before I could officially start the day’s hiking. There was probably never any doubt. Food wins every time.I got to the Wayside about a quarter to eight only to find that it would not be open for another fifteen minutes. While sitting at one of the picnic tables waiting, another hiker (from New Zealand – people come a long way to walk the AT) showed up. More people arrived in cars, and one of them, Larry, a Potomac Appalachian Trail Club Maintainer, walked up and offered to buy us breakfast!

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535648,"The intended destination for day nine was Pass Mountain Hut, about eleven miles from Skyland. Normally, even in my current overweight and out of shape condition it would have been easily doable. But things happened.I woke up early, planning to catch up on my journal and get up to date with it on line while I had good service at Skyland. It all went well until I tried doing the entries onTrail Journals. For some reason, the copy/paste function that had never given me any trouble didn’t seem to be working. There was no problem with the “select all” and “copy” of the text in Word, but when I tried to paste it in the journal’s entry box nothing was showing up. The next thing I knew two of the three entries were doubled. I spent an obscene amount of time trying to reedit before finally giving up. It was twenty after ten before I started hiking.There was a picnic ground (read, water available) about four miles away where I planed to stop for lunch. Once I get to where I want to be, able to hike an average of at least two miles an hour regardless of terrain, that will mean around a two hour walk. While each day is a little better, I am not close to a steady 2 mph average yet. I was way behind, in both time and location, where I needed to be by the time I reached the picnic ground. It was even worse by the time I had lunch. The speed problems are almost entirely from climbs and rough foot-way. For the second time in the hike, I elected to walk the Skyline Drive. It was actually longer, but it was almost all downhill. Although I did walk most of it to Panorama where I would pick up the trail again, I had to Yogi (hiker slang for talking a stranger into helping you out – from the bear of the same name) a gentleman and his wife into giving me a lift of about two miles because the alternative was walking through a tunnel.Once I reached Panorama it was back to dirt and rocks instead of pavement. It was slightly over a mile of gentle but near constant uphill, and I was forced to stop and rest (with the pack on) several times before reaching the shelter. Most of the hikers already there had elected to stay in tents or hammocks. As night fell, there were only four, myself included, in the shelter. Although, by virtue of the road walk, my day had been the easiest of anyone there, I was still so exhausted that supper made me feel borderline ill.The plans for the next day was to Gravel Springs Hut, a little over thirteen miles away.","Skyland Lodge

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535650,"I hit the trail on day 10 feeling very much the worse for wear. All morning long, and into the afternoon, I walked as if any step could be my last. The first goal of the day, Elkwallow Wayside, would, under ideal conditions, be a little over a four hour hike. It took me six. Worse, once there, the combination of food, drinks, and food – along with a generous helping of gravity, made it exceedingly difficult to move any further.Before long there were only two choices left. The first was to camel up and leave with enough water to have some during the night and hopefully until reaching the next source. The second, and I’m ashamed to say probably best in my case, was to thumb to a parking area near the shelter. Choice # 2 won. My saviors n this case were a Mr. And Mrs. Wray. I will say more on this in day eleven’s entry.When I got to the shelter there must have been at least twenty – and thirty is probably closer – hikers already there. Even tent space was precious, and I, along with several others ended up pitching my tent n the middle of a service road. This was no doubt due to the closeness of the shelter to the Skyline Drive. Even two Rangers made a brief appearance. It was at this shelter in A Walk I the Woods that Bryson and Katz left to set up their tents in a downpour because of the others in the shelter, the final straw coming when me of them referred to Katz as “sport”.It wasn’t he best night’s sleep due to an incline on two planes. One would have been alright – you just make sure that your head is higher than your feet. When you are out of plumb from side to side as well though you spend the night trying to stay on the mattress. It’s not the best of sleeping conditions. Before lying down for what little sleep I was to get there was one thought in my mind. It was my last night in the back country of Shenandoah National Park. It had to be. I was down to snacks for food.","Pass Mountain Hut

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535651,"I was one of, if not the first, away from the crowd at Gravel Springs Hut. The plan was to walk a little while and have something to pass for breakfast later when I was back on the trail. There was a short, but steep for the Park, climb from the shelter back to the trail. Not long after I was actually back on the AT, stumbling along in a not-quite-awake-yet state of being, I suddenly realized that I was sharing the trail with another living creature. A bigger than a bunny rabbit living creature. A black bigger than a bunny rabbit living creature. After ten days, countless miles, and hearing other hikers talk about seeing several in one day, I finally saw one of Shenandoah National park’s bears. And, shades of the old Ronco commercials, THERE’S MORE. As I was trying to get a little closer than the 100+ feet that separated us for a better picture, (not TOO close though, I’m not completely crazy) last year’s cub came running out of the woods from the right. The three of us continued heading the same direction at about the same pace until the two bears seemed to decide that if I wasn’t going to get off the trail, then they would. As I passed the last spot I’d seen them on the trail I noted that, if not for the denseness of the vegetation, mommy was plenty close enough for a good picture.After such a highlight to start the day it would have been hard to come up with something better. There were two time-robbing rock outcrops. Great views, beautiful weather, and moderate climbs. The last several miles would be downhill and, although it would have been pushing the envelope, I could have done my first 14 miler to VA 522 and Front Royal if I had to. But I didn’t. Have to that is.Here comes the explanation about yellow blazing that I mentioned in yesterday’s entry.The purpose of the hike I am making this summer is to fill in several gaps between VA 522 at the north end of SNP and the summit of Mount Katahdin in Maine. I would guess that between those two points I have hiked 85% of the trail already. I would love to be in the condition that would allow long miles from the get-go and end the hike saying that I walked every inch of the AT between Rockfish Gap and Baxter Peak. That aspiration has already been shot to hell. But, and this is what is important to ME, ending the summer with all the previously unhiked sections finally hiked is a very attainable goal. Some of those sections will be demanding enough that I will need to rehike many sections already done in previous years so I will be in condition to do them.Looking back, the reason for my first intentional skip in 1975 is lame. VERY lame. There was more traffic on another road than the one I came to town on. The trail between VA 522 and Harper's Ferry has changed so much that all of it is a must do. After that comes the low mountains, long ridges, and rocks of PA and MD. I fully expect to be strong enough by the time I reach Delaware Water Gap to take anything the trail throws at me. But, if the pace doesn’t pick up, there may be a skip or two of already hiked sections down the road. One last thing about SNP. Sometimes a statistic gets stuck in your head. One of them for me, from 1975, is that the AT crossed Skyline Drive 25 times. It doesn’t now, and so there has been some extensive re-routing done in the last 41 years. It was more than a little disturbing to me that I had so much trouble making good time In the Park because, in almost all cases, the climbs are gentle and relatively short. Most, no, make that all, of my problem has been my weight and lack of pre-hike conditioning. In a little over a month I will be 64. I need something like this hike to remind me.This is being written at the Quality Inn in Front Royal, VA. Yesterday afternoon I cut the day’s walk short at just over seven miles and hitched into town to get a jump on own chores so I can get back on the trail today without taking a zero. The laundry was done yesterday (you don’t realize how dirty those things you have been wearing are until you lift the lid on the washer and see water that looks like the Mississippi at flood stage) and shortly I will be leaving the room for a trip to the post office to mail several pounds of I-thought-it was-essential gear home. Then, a trip to the Food Lion will be in order. I’ll repackage everything in front of the store, and hopefully get in a few miles of trail before the sun goes down.Up until now it has been a shakedown. Today, the hike starts in earnest.","Gravel Spings Hut

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535831,"It is a requirement for AT hikers who are doing a thru-hike or long distance section hike, that once in a while there is a trip to the world of laundromats and grocery stores. If timed right, a hiker can hit town late in the day, get a room at a motel or hostel, shower and put on “town clothes”, wash trail clothes, resupply and repackage food, and be back on the trail first thing in the morning. This allows almost no time lost to the act of getting further up the trail. It is also dammed near impossible.Then, there is a nero, a day when trails miles are short due to town visits, but some progress is made on the trail, however short.Finally, there is a zero. A day when the hiker spends an entire day off the trail. It might be to simply take a day off from hiking, or because there are too many chores to get done before heading back to the trail.I knew that I would have nero days, but was hoping for no zeros. Less than two weeks into the hike, another goal has been shot down in flames.When I came into Front Royal on Sunday, I did the shower/change routine and headed straight to the laundromat. I would be sending quite a few cold weather things home. The Food Lion and the Post Office were in opposite directions of each other, so plans for the next day were Post Office first, and then Food Lion second. The grocery was on the way to the trail, so I thought it would be easiest to do that on the way out of town.I actually had gone so far as to get everything I was sending home together, and was heading for the Front Royal Visitor’s Center a block or so away to check on shuttle routes that would take me past the Post Office when I realized it was Memorial Day. The Post Office would be closed. There would be a zero in Front Royal.And it actually worked out for the best.I got plenty of rest, my feet had a chance to get some air on the few blisters I have managed to acquire, and I was able to get everything that needed done accomplished without having to rush it. There was a good lunch at KFC, far better than I have had since starting the trip, and I got what I will need for the next leg to Harper's Ferry. The store even had the Knorr dinners that I like, something the Elkton, VA store didn’t have. The only down side was that I drew a blank at the only three possible choices for two items I wanted to get. I wanted a cheap disposable rain poncho to use until I can get my good one sent somewhere up the trail, and I wanted to replace the long “town pants” I had with shorts that would be both lighter and cooler. Goodwill, Dollar Store, and Big Lots all came up short. And that, led to the biggest adventure of the entire day.I was down to pocket change as far as actual cash was concerned. Knowing that there were several cab companies to choose from (Walmart in Front Royal was WAY beyond walking distance) I went back to my room and cooled off with the AC before pursuing the quest for a poncho and shorts any further. The first problem popped up when I found that none of the three local cab companies took plastic. I REALLY needed, at the very least, get the poncho, so I called one of the companies back and asked about the cost of the ride (five bucks) and if the driver would be able to change a twenty since that was the only denomination available from the ATM. Sure, I was told, no problem. So….. I walked to the bank, got two twenties, and then walked to the nice little area near the Visitor’s Center where I sat on one of the benches, called the cab company again, and told them I needed a ride and where I was. Front Royal is not a huge town. Almost half an hour later I was beginning to wonder f thee had been a mix-up when the cab finally arrived. But it didn’t exactly take me straight to my destination. No, first there was a side trip to a small former gas station where a new tire was installed while the driver and two passengers sat in the vehicle. When we finally got to Walmart I was informed that, despite previous assurances to the contrary, the driver could NOT change a twenty. I had to go into the store and find a cashier who could break it. It was against store policy, but one lady who I would gladly nominate for Sainthood did it anyway. She rose even higher with a remark she made when I told her the fare was five bucks. She asked if I would like to have it in quarters.The trip back to the motel was with a different cab company. And for what it is worth, I did get the poncho, a new pair of shorts for town and a new pair for the trail. Now it’s back to the daily grind of walking.","Front Royal, VA Quality Inn

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536647,"Day 13 started it well.I had a good breakfast (continental style) at the motel, finished and posted the journal for day 12, and was finished packing and ready to go by 7:45. I got to the post office early and had to wait for a while before I could box the items I would be sending home (about six pounds worth, mostly cold weather clothes) but I was still down to the visitors center where the shuttle to the trail would originate well before the 9:50 (or so I thought) departure time. I discovered not long after I got there that I was confused on the times and the bus had already departed. Just like the first time I needed to get back to the trail from Front Royal, I was going to have to thumb it. Luck was with me. I actually got to the trailhead faster than if I had taken the shuttle.The trail started out easy with no climbing for an unbelievable distance. When the climbing did start, it was not bad at all. I walked without taking a pack off break until reaching the Denton shelter at about the five mile point.There are shelters, and then there are shelters.This one featured at deck with bench seats, a three or four person Adirondack chair and what looked like regularly mowed grounds. Maybe fifty feet to the right of the shelter (while looking at it) was a covered area with a picnic table for cooking so that food smells (think bears) would not be in the shelter. To the left of the shelter was a spring fed shower that was plumbed to allow getting water (although it still needed to be filtered) without having to walk all the way to the spring. Just in case hikers are not tired enough at the end of the day there are a couple of horseshoe pits complete with horseshoes. I would have loved to stay there, but I couldn’t justify stopping so early with so few miles behind me.The rest of the day went slower. At the end of the next significant climb after the first shelter there was a bench in an open field that trapped me for way too long. There were no great views, it was simply a pleasant place to sit. Shortly before leaving, I was joined by a rabbit that could not have been less concerned with my presence if I had been one of his own.After the bench, there was a knee and thigh punishing descent that was rocky and difficult in a few places.Before beginning the last climb of the day, the trail passed a little parking area with a picnic table. When I saw a cooler on the table I thought I was in for some trail magic. Not so. By the smell of things, I was three or four days late. Like the bench at the top of the previous climb, I stayed there longer than I should have.During the long climb to the Manassas Gap shelter I finally crashed and and had to drop the pack and lay down for a while. Even so, the speed I had been able to sustain prior to the crash was encouraging. I finally reached the shelter around 7:15 after a hike of just over ten miles that started at 9:40. Not great time, but there were those long breaks along the way…….The shelter is at the other end of the spectrum from the Denton shelter. It’s one of the older ones made of chinked logs although there is a newer metal roof. There are a number of other hikers, but most of them have chosen to tent it rather than use the shelter, so one other hiker and myself have the shelter to ourselves tonight. Well, almost to ourselves. The mouse problem at this shelter will probably be zero, because the two human occupants are sharing the shelter with to adult black rat snakes that are coiled on the top log of the back wall.","Front Royal, VA Quality Inn

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536648,"In some respects it has been a great day, in others, not so much. On the plus side, I hiked over 13 miles. On the negative, it was short of what I was hoping for. Counting breaks, my average for the day was just a little over 1mph. There were several breaks, and I almost fell asleep on two of them.I didn’t wake up until 6:30 this morning and was the last one to leave the area around the shelter. The humidity was awful, and I spent a great deal of the day as wet as if I had been walking in the rain.Lunch was at Dick’s Dome shelter, a not quite geodesic structure that was interesting if not terribly practical. (As a trail shelter with people sleeping on the floor, the shape wastes space. Rectangular makes a lot more sense) I hadn’t exactly been a ball of fire hiking-wise before lunch. After lunch it really went into granny-gear.I was thinking that the trail would be passing a State Park visitor’s center and I was looking forward to some cold drinks. It was a major, demoralizing, disappointment to find out it didn’t. The realization prompted the first throw-off-the-pack-and-lay down break where I almost fell asleep. (The second would be at Ashby Gap) Just as I was getting ready to leave I noticed a small black animal that I first thought was a dog just ahead of two hikers. It turned out to be a crow. He was hopping along just ahead of them just like a dog might have walked ahead of them. Sometimes you see strange things out here.From the Skymeadows State Park it was down hill all the way to Ashby Gap. Since I first walked the section in 1975 the trail has been rerouted. As I remember it, at that time it came out opposite one end of VA 601 where, due to several landowners closing access to the trail, there was a long road walk. That road walk has been replaced with one of the trail’s more infamous sections. A fourteen mile series of PUDS (pointless ups and downs) known as the Roller Coaster.I was wiped out by the time I reached Ashby Gap even though it had been a long downhill. Mostly because it had been a long downhill. My right knee hurt, I was down to half a liter of water, and, if I could have stopped there I would have. But I couldn’t. Tired as I was, I had to go a little farther. I finished for the day camping alone near a stream. Dinner was a liter of water flavored with Crystal Light lemonade. Real dinner will come as breakfast #2 when I reach the shelter I was hoping to reach today.The weather has been fantastic except for the humidity.

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536649,"Two weeks ago today I started north from Rockfish Gap. In the time that has past since, I had come to grips with how out of condition I actually am. Each day shows some improvement in stamina but I still have a long way to go. I have come to accept that I may have to skip a few previously hiked sections in order to get the unhiked sections finished. This is a double-edged sword, because I need to get as many conditioning miles in as possible before I reach the much harder mountains of the northeast.Today I really goofed off, hiking a mere 1.6 miles to the shelter I was hoping to reach yesterday. I was still a little woozy from yesterday’s long hike, I was facing the worst of the roller-coaster section, and stopping after a ridiculously short day just seemed like a good idea. As it approaches 5:30 in the afternoon, it still seems like a good idea.Most of the day has been spent napping and reading a book left at the shelter.Tomorrow I hope for an early start for another short day of about eight miles to the Bears Den Hostel.

For thru-hikers who are approaching the 1000 mile mark, the Roller Coaster is not that it of a deal. I know this because I saw so many of them pass by as if they were strolling down a city sidewalk while I was lying alongside the trail waiting for the strength to continue. But, while it was something they could take in stride, to me it was torture. I took a LOT of lie down and use the pack for a pillow breaks. All of them long. So long in fact, that I spent more time not moving than moving. The end result was that I stopped short of my original goal, stopping at the Sam Moore shelter. The rate was less than seven miles in just over eleven hours.I realized that I was hiking a section that technically I had already hiked. The only skip I needed to fill between the north end of SNP and Harper's Ferry was from VA 522 and Linden. That is done. Tomorrow when I reach Snickers Gap I will thumb on into Harper's Ferry.

I ate a little more breakfast than I normally would for what I knew was coming, prompting a trip to the privy before starting out. The short climb up the hill to the privy, sans pack, required a quick catch my breath break. Oh yeah, this is going to be a fun day.The first climb wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be and gave me a little bit of a moral boost even though it ended with a long break. Soon though, just like the day before, this one went….well, downhill is not the best choice of words, sour. It took from 7:AM until 4:PM to hike just under four miles.When the day’s walking ended at Snicker’s Gap I stuck out my thumb and was quickly rewarded with a ride that took me all the way to the Econolodge is Harper's Ferry.

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539163,"Today was short by design. I wanted to “visit” Harper's Ferry, and I knew I would be slow clearing the town.Among the chores on tap were renewing my ATC dues in person. I have now been a member for 43 years.There was also a need to replace the spoon I started with. The old one broke at Rod Hollow shelter, and the duct tape repair was so-so at best. The new one should be indestructible. At the very least, it might be easier to fix with duct tape.A lot of time was spent looking at exhibits, and even watching a short film. Barely a glance was given to the old hose house known as John Brown’s Fort as I headed toward the walkway across the Potomac River.In 1975, the AT did not enter Harper's Ferry. Instead, it crossed the Potomac downstream of the confluence with the Shenandoah on the Sandy Hook bridge. After the walkway was built alongside one of the railroad bridges it became possible to begin the walk on the old C&O Canal tow path directly opposite the lower town of Harper's Ferry. While I was crossing the river on the walkway, a freight train crossed heading the same direction on a nearby but different bridge. Once I reached the old tow path it was smooth sailing. Running along side the Potomac in a downstream direction, the tow path is mostly level with a slightly downhill favor. There were not a lot of walkers after getting away from the Harper's Ferry area, but there were a lot of people on bicycles.The mossy old canal offered a lot of chances for turtle watching.Between starting the tow path walk and passing under the old trail on the Sandy Hook bridge, a large group of rafters went by on the Potomac.Not too long after passing under the bridge I started seeing railroad cars on the tracks above and across the canal. The engines had not yet reached the spot where the AT crossed the tracks when I got there. I recognized the engine number as the one that had crossed the Shenandoah the same time I did. I may be slow, BUT I PASSED A FREIGHT TRAIN!!!!! The fact that it wasn’t moving for a while is beside the point. The victory was short lived. I took a pack-off break before crossing in front of the train, and while doing so it resumed moving and made it through the crossing ahead of me.After crossing the tracks the trail crossed a parking area and then reentered the woods, soon after passing under a bridge for Rt. 340. At this point I had a small decision to make. I had started the day thinking that I would end up wasting a lot of time in Harper's Ferry (which I did) and make it no farther than the motel I stayed at in 1975. I had even left Harper's Ferry with that thought. The tow path had been very easy walking. So easy in fact, that I found myself about a mile and a half past the motel I thought I’d stay at. I was sitting on a guardrail alongside the road pondering my options when, no thumb required, a guy pulled over and offered me a ride. That got me to the motel. I could only hope that getting back to the trail in the morning would be as easy.","Harper's Ferry

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539164,"Shortly after arriving at the Knights Inn last night it started raining. Really raining. Pouring, coming down in sheets. I was glad I was not walking in it.Dinner was sandwiches made from lunch meat and bread purchased from the convenience store across the road from the motel.After partaking of the motel breakfast I crossed the street again and topped off with a bottle of milk and a roll. Then, it was a short walk to 340 to try and thumb back to the trail. I was lucky, and shortly after I started thumbing I was back on the AT.It started out with easy trail, and before I knew it I was crossing Weaverton Road. After crossing the road, the trail began the ascent of South Mountain.It should have been reasonably easy. The grades were gentle by most standards, and there were plenty of switchbacks for steeper sections. Nonetheless, I had to take advantage of several logs and rocks for short rest breaks. Just as I reached the side trail to Weaverton Cliffs, I was passed by the first of several hikers who would pass me before the day was over. The other hiker stopped long enough to read the sign and continued on his way. I dropped my pack and headed downhill to the cliffs. I’m glad I did. The view of Harper's Ferry was great. You could see where the current trail route crosses the Shenandoah River and where the old route crossed the Potomac. With binoculars I could see the steeple in Harper's Ferry that was so prominent at Jefferson’s Rock. You could even see the Casino in Charles Town.Before leaving I took a picture with my phone and sent it to Angus White who I had hiked several hundred miles with in 1975. He texted back almost immediately asking how I was doing. I replied that I was beginning to have serious doubts about being able to do what I had set out to do.After spending way too much time at the cliffs, I finally returned to the trail and the walk along the spine of South Mountain. It was my hope that the ridge walking of Maryland and Pennsylvania would finally allow my body to adjust to hiking without wearing it down first.After a few pack-off and lie down breaks I arrived at the Ed Garvey shelter. It was a nice shelter, but there was so much written in the shelter register and Guthook app about the distance and steepness of the trail to the spring that I didn’t even consider going for water. It was, after all, only a few miles more to Gathland State Park where water would be available.Not long after leaving the Garvey shelter, I didn’t so much hit the wall, as I slammed into it at light speed. The low energy level was something I was still hoping I could deal with. However, during the afternoon I started having some knee problems. Both knees. The ball joints in my hips had been hurting for over a week. Just before shedding my pack for another long lay down break I felt the all too familiar twinge that has preceded lower back problems for years.I was lying along side the trail when it hit me. I was having trouble on almost level trail with almost perfect hiking weather. What was I going to do when the temperatures were hot, the water scarce, and the mountains harder? At best, someone was going to have to carry me off a mountain. It was time to admit defeat and bail out. It was no longer a question of will, fortitude, or desire. My body – just about every part of it from the neck down – was not capable of doing a long distance hike where making X number of miles each day was vital to success. A quick text to the guy taking care of my mail drops stopped him from sending the first one in the nick of time. After that, I remained prone for a while longer before setting out once again for Gathland State Park. There were a few more sit on a log or rock breaks, but my pack remained on my back until I reached the park. The first order of business was to dig out my water bottle and fill it and drain it. Twice. Then it was time to call the Econolodge in Harper's Ferry and book a room for the night. The choice of motel was dictated by it being close to Charlestown where the nearest car rental was located.For the second time in a day I was lucky with a ride. Less than a dozen vehicles passed before I hooked a ride that took me straight to the motel. The day was over. Disappointingly, the hike was over. There were a few things I needed to do to start the journey home, but that could wait until morning.","Knight's Inn

Randy Johnson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539194,"It was Steve McQueen’s final line in The Sand Pebbles.“What the Hell happened?”After almost six months of planning and working out, a hike planned for three and a half to four months lasted a few days shy of three weeks.I did not underestimate the trail, but I did overestimate me. The biggest problem I encountered, lack of stamina did not come as a total surprise. It first surfaced last October on a hike planned to cover the distance between Davenport Gap and Erwin, TN. That hike ended in Hot Springs due to energy levels that made those of the hike just ended seem super-human by comparison. After months of pushing myself on treadmills, stair climbers, and elliptical machines, I started from Rockfish Gap fully believing that any conditioning not accomplished at the gym would be taken care of on the trail by taking it easy the first few weeks. At 21 it would have. At 63, almost 64, it didn’t.Most of the day after leaving the trail was spent back in Harper's Ferry, due to not being able to get a rental car until after 5:00PM. Even without a pack on (the folks at Econolodge let me stow it in a utility closet) my energy was incredibly lacking. A lot of the day was spent sitting and even lying down. And, both hips and knees continued to hurt.The trip home started just before six o’clock at a Enterprise Agency next to the casino I’d been able to see from Weaverton Cliffs the day before. Night found me at a motel west of Elkton, the town where I had done my first resupply. The next morning I headed east, passing through Elkton and then getting on the Skyline Drive. It was nice seeing some of the same places I’d seen so recently one more time. When I reached Rockfish Gap I was happy to be able to give a ride to a hiker thumbing to Waynesboro.I arrived at Connersville’s Amtrack station about a hour behind schedule, and was saved the partly uphill two mile walk home by a friend and neighbor who had volunteered to pick me up. It was the day that would have marked the start of week number four.As I write this, almost two weeks later, I am more convinced than ever that stopping the hike was the right decision. My right knee, even without the added weight of a pack or the uneven gait required (by me anyway) by walking around and over roots and rocks is still stiff and hurting. I have not unfrozen my gym membership yet, but when I do it will probably feel like starting over from scratch. Instead of the hike improving my stamina, it seems to have caused it to regress to pre-training levels.In the twelve months preceding the hike I had been to two doctors who both performed complete physicals, lab work included. Aside from hypertension for which I take medication each day, both gave me a clean bill of health. Right before Christmas, a blood clot in my left leg added another pill to my breakfast each morning. Two pills a day for someone in their sixties isn’t too bad really, and I doubt that either of them contributed to my problems. But I am not a doctor.Over the years I have suffered rotator cuff damage to both shoulders, and suffered occasional debilitating lower back pain. Although my shoulders were bothering me a little I probably could have ignored any pain from them. My back was a different story. There have been times when any movement at all –rolling over in bed, taking even a tiny step, sneezing ……anything, caused pain that can only be described as excruciating. I was starting to feel the twinges, and if my back had gone out the only way I would have been able to get off the trail was under someone else’s power.I really wanted to fill in my skipped sections and be able to say that I’d walked the entire Appalachian Trail. Feeling reasonably healthy and used to physical labor, I had no reason to think that I couldn’t. Now, I know better. And, oddly, considering the time, preparation, and money that went into the venture, I’m okay with it. Had I not tried, I would have spent the rest of my life wishing that I’d had the chance. Thanks to others who were willing to help, I had the chance. That I failed was due entirely to physical limitations. And, even thoughI failed to lose the weight I wanted to lose before I started, I’m not sure that it would have made all that much difference.    Age didn’t help either although people a lot older than me have completed thru-hikes. In my case it was simply a combination of too many factors, age, joints, muscles, weight, and lack of conditioning.My hiking days are not over. I will continue to enjoy local trails and, hopefully at least a few miles of the AT each year. Without a pack. Backpacking, if it occurs, will be overnight hikes or week-long or less hikes requiring only short daily miles.I first joined the ATC in 1973. That is a long time to be a member of any organization, and I plan to be a member as long as I live. Those reading this that have spent a lot of time hiking on the AT will know what I mean when I say it becomes part of your being. There has not been a week that has passed since I took those first steps north from Springer Mountain in 1975 that I have not had something happen that has made me think of the Appalachian Trail. It could be a certain section of woods, a cow path through a pasture, even the simple act of walking in rain. All of these things, and many more that fail to come to mind, can evoke memories stretching back over four decades. I accept the fact that there are sections of the AT that I will never hike,and views that I will never see. Like I have already said, I’m okay with that. My life is much richer for what I have hiked and seen. And, although it may not always have seemed so at the time, I’m glad for every second of it.","Gathland State Park
