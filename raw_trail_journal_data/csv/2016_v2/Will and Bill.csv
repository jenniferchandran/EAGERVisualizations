Will and Bill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519200,"Happy New Years! With 5 months to go before our start date for Harper's Ferry northbound flip flop (needs an acronym), the reality of doing this thing is hitting home. We've registered our hikes and Will and I have been comparing gear and are beginning to identify the gaping holes in our equipping and planning. Over the course of these early articles, I'll try to hit the hi lights and with luck will give some insight into the why and why now of our thru hike.",,"Happy New Years, I'm doing a Flip Flop!","Jan 01, Fri",0
Will and Bill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519199,"Sometimes, life events align and it's the ""right time"". I've wanted to do the AT since high school, which was a long time ago. Now, with retirement from the Army just a few months away, I suddenly find myself with a luxury of time and a desire to define a clean break from a 30 plus year career. A delightful bonus is that my younger son, Will, is ready nod willing to complete a thru hike with me. Being able to do a thru hike while raising funds for Warrior Hike is icing on the cake, but more on this in a future post.",,The Why(s) of it all,"Jan 06, Wed",0
Will and Bill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519414,"Why a flip flop? Timing, mostly. We're moving back from the United Kingdom in March and have to survive the rituals of receiving household goods and picking up our MINI from the port so there's no practical way to start before June. This, combined with a community spirited desire to help out with NOBO crowding, led to a decision to flip the flop from Harper's Ferry, first heading north to Katahdin. It's not that Will and I don't see the attraction of a NOBO. I had the opportunity to summit Katahdin the week before graduating from UNECOM (with a speeding ticket on the way back south to remember it by) and it would make for a memorable culminating point. But, as I stated in a previous post, when it's time, it's time.What advantages do we get with the flip flop? A chance of fair weather for much of the trip. A chance to travel with both NOBO and SOBO hikers (potentially re-meeting some of the SOBOs we cross paths with on our way north). A more leisurely pace than if we tried to rush a NOBO, with the chance to explore and with more wiggle room to adjust for any misadventures. Finally, no need to wait until 2017.On the down side, we'll have way less prep time than would be comfortable and shakedown hikes will be limited to a couple of overnighters in southwest Florida. The schedule leading up to our 1 June start will be more than a little tight.",,Why a Flip Flop?,"Jan 09, Sat",0
Will and Bill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520898,"For our 2016 Flip Flop, Will and I are honored to be able to support the Warrior Hike ""Walk Off the War"" program. (To learn more about this excellent program for veterans, go to www.warriorhike.org ). You can donate directly to warrior hike at http://warriorhike.org/donate/william-statz/ . There you'll find a handy link to my Trail Journal which will bring you back...here!
Why Warrior Hike and not some other Wounded Warrior or Veteran's program? First, WH is mission focused on getting veterans out onto our National Scenic Trails in a long form format that makes absolute sense for many service members who need time to re-enter civilian life. Secondly, WH is a volunteer run organization. This translates into lower overhead and a greater proportion of donated resources going to getting vets out on the trail. No big conferences at expensive resorts.
Finally, while I'll be retiring from the Army, I'll actually still be on active duty when Will and I start on 1June. Despite a long career and a sense that the Army and I have had a mutually beneficial relationship, I'm a bigger fan of Soldiers than I am of things 'military'. I don't go out of my way to watch parades and have never been impressed by 'flag waving' patriotism. Enough said on that. I think I'll stick to a gear article for my next post.",,Supporting Warrior Hike,"Feb 09, Tue",0
Will and Bill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521541,"A little counter app on my iphone informed me that 100 days from now (well, 99 as of this writing), Will and I will be taking our first steps on the trail at Harpers Ferry. Meanwhile, back in reality, we're prepping our house in the UK for everything to be packed up to ship back to the US and our next home in Florida. All of my nearly complete thru-hike kit is sitting in various places back in the Sunshine State, having yet to be brought together in one place, much less given a shake down. March is pretty much history before it begins. April and May will be a flurry of activity, receiving household goods into a new home, picking the car up from Atlanta and settling in as much as possible before leaving. All while slipping in training hikes and a couple overnighters. No anxiety here!Ultimately, on 31 May, I'll kiss my wife good bye at the airport and Will and I will fly up to DC for the train ride to Harpers Ferry. It's all good.",,100 days,"Feb 22, Mon",0
Will and Bill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524172,"Time is ticking. After seeing our household goods crated and loaded on to a truck in England, not to be seen in sunny Florida until May!, I'm doubly glad that my trail kit remained in the US. In the hectic week of our return stateside, there was even an opportunity to sort of inventory and order a few items found missing or lacking. Now we sit in VA for a week of turn in and admin in preparation for military retirement. 
In an effort to appear more proactive, here's what Will and I have been able to work at:
-I've had a physical (go Landstuhl RMC!) and have kept in good shape. No show stoppers there.
-We've gotten our gear 90% sorted and Will had a brief shakedown hike in Yosemite.
-received the AT Guide, NOBO and SOBO, and have familiarized ourselves with it. A great piece of practical literature.
-Will is working on his trail kitty.
What remains to do:
-next week starts morning hikes with gear (hills are non-existent here in SW Florida, so I get to look cool on the stair stepper at the local Y!)
-get acquainted with my new TarpTent Notch
-we should have time for an overnighter and a two nighter
-purchase our first food lot
-finalize travel plans and overnight for the day before our start",,71 days and a wake up,"Mar 20, Sun",0
Will and Bill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534463,"Entering this via my iPhone, mostly for practice. Took another survey of my gear in final prep for our departure, next week. Other than purchasing my initial food load. I'm pretty much there. I've attached a photo of my little electronics kit. iPhone SE (like the size and got the 64 gig for media between uploads.), Black Diamond ReVolt Headlamp, a small Motorola battery charger I've had for a couple of years, RHA headphones withe the doggle for the Lifeproof Case and a Suta dual USB charger (it's fast and should allow me to get everything charged simultaneously on one plug). It all goes in a small Gravity Gear silnylon bag. For those playing along on the home game, it all weighs in at 15 oz.I've promised a lot of folks pics and updates and this should at least get me started.",,It's the little things,"May 22, Sun",0
Will and Bill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535762,"My pack is stuffed with everything, including 4 days of food. The straps are reversed, the outside pockets empty, and a $5 Wallyworld pack cover wrapped around it backwards and reinforced with duct tape for the flight to DC. A quick REI trip from the Metro Red line, then Amtrak from Rockville to Harper's Ferry and a night at the Tea Horse before starting our flip flop NOBO.Many thanks to be made. First to my wife, Helen, for manning the home front a mere 2 months after moving back from the UK. Thanks to Kaitlin ( otherwise known as StatzInk ) for the artwork. She's very talented and will be working on another AT surprise! Thanks to everyone who's supported Warrior Expeditions to date. They're busier than ever and I look forward to running into some of their adventurers on the trail.Until next time...",,Last day home,"May 30, Mon",0
Will and Bill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537400,"Doing this as a one week blast. Great respect for people who do consistent and detailed updates on this site. The photo upload app makes my photos hard to find and text input is sometimes beyond the usual iPhone typing joyousness. Anyhow, I've tried to capture impressions and will make another photo upload attempt. In the meantime, more consistent updates can be found at @wstatz on Facebook.. First day, we woke up at the Teahorse Inn and had excellent, eggy waffles. After a mile scenic walk through historic Harper's Ferry, we found our first white blaze. We were on the trail!. The trellis bridge crossing marked our first waypoint and the WC/MD line. Initial impressions were the odour of honey suckle on CnO, azaleas, rocks and up and downs and views. We encountered our first trail magic from Diane and in a fit of inappropriate enthusiasm ended up found 18 miles to Dahlgren Campground 2 Headed north past old stone church. We came upon a small herd of deer then emerged to find a memorial of two dead generals. A park for the original Washington Memorial of 1827 gave us a quick history lesson. Stayed at first shelter after 14 miles. Met cheesy. Buzz and topknot. Shelter mate had sleep apnea and snored like a wookie3 early start with some hellacious rocky ups and downs. First stream crossing we avoided the comedic element but sure it will happen eventually. Stayed 6 hours at PenMar park. Buzz and Topknot's relations met us with molasses cookies and contraband beer. Buzz offered us a ride to town in his 97 Chevy pickup and we got pizza and re supply at Walmart. Crossed Mason Dixon line into PA.Overnight at an amazing camp spot by stream. Will's right knee bothering him. Will take the next day slow.4 more ups and down without many views. Stopped at amazing Tumbling Run Shelter, dual with covered picnic table and clothes lines. Spring on other side of brook where we rinsed clothes and took very cold bathes. Met trail maintenance crew and hiker named Spider. Will's knee hurting.5 relaxed start with 900 foot climb but rewarded with view of uninterrupted forest from Chimney Rocks. Spider offered Will a knee brace which seemed to help. With severe weather predicted we elected to stay at Trail of Hope hostel to clean up and wait it out. Met Snake, a former NOAA flight director and Speilberg, who has a large following on his video blog.6 dropped off at AT by Robert from Trail of Hope. Passed Quarry shelter, possibly nicest on AT. We elected to do 20 miles to Ironmasters hostel. Trail supposed to be some easiest on northern AT but still has challenging rock sections and kicked my butt. Avery was fast but paid for it. Was fortunately able to ice his knee. We had the Hiker burgers with egg, bacon, and avocado. Did not do half gallon challenge.7 One week down. Did museum and hung out. Went swimming at Fuller Lake but was chased out by thunder storm. Hiked seven miles to James Fry shelter in less than three hours. Feet pretty good and Achilles got better. Met Chef and Trekeroni showed up for the night.","Harpers Ferry, WV
