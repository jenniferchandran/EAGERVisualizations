Ponder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543720,"Good afternoon,This is my first journal entry and I am both excited and nervous to start my Southbound Appalachian trail hike.

Ponder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543831,"I am in Bangor, Maine waiting for the 6:30 pm bus to medway. I will stay at the AT lodge in Millinocket tonight and hike Katahdin tomorrow. A storm is brewing outside but I am safe inside the bus station. It has been funny to hear locals complaining about the heat, it is 78 degrees and that is 20 degrees less than where I came from. I underestimated how common lobster is in Maine at the McDonald's I passed they had a lobster crossing sign which fit their advertised lobster roll menu well. LOL.In pokemon go news I am one of the highest leveled players here, I am only level 18 but easily took over the local poke gym.",,In Maine,"Jul 28, Thu",0
Ponder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545077,"After a solid breakfast in Millinocket I was shuttled from there into Baxter State Park. All the Maine locals have been warning me that Katahdin is super tough and overall I would say that the difficulty was overstated. The mountain is difficult and takes a while but I was never concerned that I would not finish it. I hiked today with a new friend from the UK. While hiking we worked on picking out a trail name, I brainstormed a bunch of names and from my suggestion of red tiger he settled on the trail name ""Ginger Tiger.*Note: for those who don't know a trail name is how Appalachian trail hikers introduce themselves. It is a fun way to embrace the trail culture. My name is Ponder because I like to think about a wide array of subjects while hiking and to be slightly ironic because I can't ponder too long in any location or I won't finish before winter comes.The hike today took about 10 hours. 4.5 hours up, 0.5 hrs at top, 5 hrs down. 5.2 miles each way. Some rock climbing required, saw lots of other hikers, some who had to walk back in the dark.Ginger Tiger was generous enough to let me share his campsite (I was unable to get a reservation ahead of time)","In Maine
