Nick was born on December 26, 1851. By the time Nick was just three years old both his mother, Mary Heaton Grindstaff, and his father, Issac Grindstaff, died. Nick and his three siblings were left orphans. Nick lived with relatives until he was 21 years old. He was an active member of the Baptist church. At age 21 Nick's parents' farm was divided into fourths for the children. Nick built a house on his fourth and began to farm the land. After five years of farming Nick sold his farm to E. S. Jordon and decided to go west.
Nick was robbed of everything he owned. He went to Benjamin Wilson in Missouri for help. Benjamin had moved to Missouri from Carter County. Benjamin sent Nick back home. After Nick return he lived with Mr. Jordan. He refused to stay with any of his relatives. After a while Nick decided to live on Iron Mountain. He went to the highest peak where Johnson and Carter Counties dividing line are and built a hut of logs and boards. Nick lived in this hut for more than 30 years. Nick stayed busy clearing land, building fences, and raising a garden. He gathered roots and herbs and traded them for supplies.
Nick defended himself with a barlow knife, an ax, and a hickory stick. Although Nick isolated himself and looked rugged from the many layers of old clothes and the long hair he wore, no one was afraid of him because of his kindness.
On July 21, 1923 Baxter McEwen went by to check on Nick. He found him dead on the bunk in his hut. His faithful dog had been keeping watch over his master's dead body for the past three or four days. The dog had to be tied before men could carry out Nick's body for burial. Nick was buried on the mountain peak where he lived the last 30 years of his life.

Lice, fleas, and mosquitoes have also been found to contain Borrelia. Some people develop a bull’s eye-like rash, called Erythra migrans, after being bitten by a tick.It normally appears between 3 and 30 days after infection. As infection spreads, Borrealia can also affect the skin in other areas; the nervous system; the joints or the heart.The brain becoming infected is a rare but potentially serious complication, arising in 15 per cent of untreated Lyme patients who go on to be very ill.This can also cause permanent brain damage.Because of this wide range of non-specific symptoms, patients often don’t get a clear diagnosis or treatment options.When Lyme disease is suspected, laboratory tests to detect specific antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi can help confirm the diagnosis – although these are far from perfect. Some patients, about 10-20 per cent, can develop a debilitating chronic condition called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome.They suffer symptoms including arthritis, fatigue, muscle pain and minor cognitive impairments such as headaches and sleep disturbances.Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine available against Lyme disease - but there are measures we can carry out to reduce the risk of infection.These include avoiding tick-infested areas, wearing protective clothing and insect repellent to reduce the risk of being bitten.","War Spur Hostel
