"Flames and Lil"" Lucky",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523975,"Hi there,It`s Flames and Lil Lucky.Well it's time to make our first entry,finally.After years of thinking and daydreaming of what it would be like to thru hike the A.T. we began to plan for it in 2013.Yep,an eternity ago,or at least it seems to have been.And now what seems to be an eternity away were beginning our adventure on March 24,2016.At least all the things we've had to do the past few weeks to start has kept us well occupied.But you just can't get that thought of the trail out of your head.Then there's all the reactions from family,friends,and neighbors,who we have finally let in on our secret.Which most are we're told we're crazy or we've lost our minds.While others say ""So you're checking one off your bucket list before you die"".No we're going to live while we're alive.And the neighbors finally understand we're not the ""village idiots"" because we were out at midnight walking around the neighborhood on all those snowy nights with backpacks and ""ski poles"" when shaking down some of our gear.Then there's my favorite,""You're walking all the way from Ga.to Maine?No,we're hiking from Ga.to Maine.Because to us there's a big difference in walking and hiking.We do a lot of walking everyday but seldom do we get the great pleasure of hiking.Then comes the second question,""How are you going to get back?""Which we're thinking if we just accomplished this feat surely we can figure that out then.Then there's the preverbial Why.Which we usually respond with if you have to ask you will never understand.They can't grasp a life of simplicity,without all the things ""we have to have to live""today.But for us it's simple.what's the use of the everyday grind to have all these things and never enjoying them.especially just enjoying life and what GOD has put around us.So last summer we started going on shakedown hikes in the Smokies and Hampton to Damascus area.We feel we are prepared for our adventure,at least physically and gear wise.And hopefully we are mentally prepared as well.Steps will tell.For us it's hard to pinpoint one thing that has made us decide to do this.In actuality,we think it's a lifetime of bad decisions,addictions,failed marriages and relationships.But we're truly happy its led us to the A.T..The time we spent on the trail last year and the people we met reinforce that the A.T. is where we need to be.So ready or not here we come.i",,pre hike 1,"Mar 19, Sat",0
