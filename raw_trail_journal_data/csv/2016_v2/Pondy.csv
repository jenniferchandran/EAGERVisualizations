Pondy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523968,"Currently two full days before the beginning of my hike. Spending time relaxing with my family and absorbing the comforts of home while rounding up gear and finalizing plans. One of my main struggles is working to strike a balance between bringing enough items and supplies to be comfortable and prepared without having too much excess weight on my back.Some background about myself: I am 24. While originally from Winter Springs, a town near Orlando, Florida, I had been living in Washington, DC recently working as a government contractor. Captivated by the AT for many years and ready to go in a different direction in life, I saved up what I could and left my job with the goal of having an adventurous transitional experience and avoiding any and all media coverage of the 2016 presidential election. I have a good amount of outdoors experience from the Boy Scouts but have never been on such an extended hike and as such needed to update a lot of my gear.",,View Entry,"Mar 18, Fri",0

It has been very enjoyable and challenging hiking in Georgia so far. The trail is defined by intense uphill climbs rewarded with stunning views over nearby valleys (the panoramic views leaving Suches, GA really stuck with me). These ascents are followed by knee-jarring descents into gaps. It's great meeting new people every day who are out here doing the same thing as well as getting more familiar with a smaller group of hikers who have been keeping roughly the same pace.
After six days, I'll be getting off the trail Sunday night for a shower and laundry at the Top of Georgia Hostel in Hiawassee. Can't overstate my excitement for that shower. The hostel will provide a free ride from Unicoi Gap (Mile 52.9) and back the next day. I should get into North Carolina late next week.
I will be trying to increase the journal entry frequency- it's been tough conserving phone battery on the cold nights we've been having. More to come.","Springer Mountain

I spent about 20 minutes hitting the walls of my tent until they got scared away or realized there was no food to be had. Camped the next night with some great people and an irresponsibly large camp fire at the former site of the Rocky Knob shelter. 
I crossed off 50 miles up the trail the next day on 3/27 (Easter Sunday) as clouds and rain moved in. The same day, at Unicoi Gap, I found a hiker feed set up under tents in the pouring rain by some wonderful former AT hikers and their parents with Easter candy, ham, hot dogs, beer, and much more. Caught a shuttle from there to the Top of Georgia hiking center where I camped for the night (their bunks were already full). At the hostel I had my laundry done and got a much needed shower. They gave out scrubs for guests to wear while their laundry was being done. This gave a bit of a mental hospital or cult vibe but it worked out well.
March 28 was my longest hiking day yet at about 12 miles. This was the best section of the trail yet and there was an excellent view on Tray Mountain (4430') with a mountaintop hiker jam session thrown in for good measure. I'm glad I have my little guitar with me!","Low Gap Shelter

I am currently in wonderful Franklin, NC for the night to get some groceries and a shower / laundry.I've had ""trail magic"" on my mind a lot recently. Trail magic is a pretty broad term and means many different things to many different people, but to me it is composed of the things that balance out the not-inconsequential difficulties of day-to-day life on the trail. Here are two recent examples: March 31st was a day-long slog through the rain. My lunch was a rain soaked tortilla wrapped around rain soaked cheese, and I set my tent up in a steady downpour. But right near sunset, the clouds unexpectedly broke and I was able to take a quick hike up the Raven Rock Cliffs side trail near the campsite that I had read should not be missed. The next day, as I sat by a dirt road in Deep Gap, drying out from the previous night and thinking about this journal entry and trail magic, a pickup with two former AT 2000 milers and a grill, cold drinks, and burgers pulled in.P.S. - The Raven Rock trail wound through the wreckage of an old plane crash before emerging out onto sheer cliffs and a mind-altering view over a valley and the local mountains.

Had a memorable day off from hiking yesterday at the NOC which I happened to pass through right during their annual Trail Magic Festival. I spent the night of the 8th in a four person bunk shack with fellow thru hiker Mr Fabulous and two section hikers from Atlanta, Campbell and Twinkle. That night I was tentatively given the trail name FunGuy based on the weird blistery thing possibly growing on my foot (I bought some cream for it don't worry) and my penchant for a good time. For the second night we moved to a free campsite down the river from the NOC with about 15 other hikers.
The Trail Magic festival had manufacturer booths set up with free gear (dry bags, lighters, utensils, etc.) during the day and a free all you can eat spaghetti dinner for AT hikers plus live music by local band Bird in Hand and lots of cheap beer by night.

HOW PERFECT IS THAT!! Schnickelfritz and I came across it on the short side trail leading to the Shuckstack Fire Tower. It seemed pretty unafraid of hikers- we had to yell and wave to get it to run away from the trail.

There are a pretty ridiculous amount of regulations in the park in my view. It's a bit of a shock coming from the previous 150 Mi or so of trail that were much freer and often provided a nicer hike with better maintained trail and facilities, but I understand that things may be different in the most frequently visited park in the US. Anyway, for the Smokies all thru hikers must buy and print out a $20 permit before entering the park. Hikers are required to stay in the park's shelters unless a shelter is full in which case thru hikers must give up space in the shelter to section hikers (that is hikers who are out for a few days). If a shelter fills up then you can set up a tent within sight of the shelter. The water sources in the park are so far weak and far between. The trail is also poorly blazed and signed and does not offer as many overlooks as other sections so far. With that said, I have been working to focus on the positives in the park: Lots of excellent side trails and tons of wildlife to be encountered. I have been trying to wander down at least one side trail each day, and have seen a bear, wild hogs, a huge turkey, and lots of friendly two legged tourists.","Birch Spring Gap Camping Area

Proceeded to then eat two double cheeseburgers, fries, and two quarter pounders (those were on the house) at McDonalds. I feel pretty disgusting from that but I've been really, really hungry the last week. Plus some free ""moonshine"" tastings at the distillery across the street helped wash it all down. I think the infamous hiker hunger really kicked in the last few days and I resupplied accordingly today- More snacks and bigger lunches. Deciding between Mexican and BBQ for dinner.

When I realized the trail would be going onto an exposed hillside, I turned and sprinted about a quarter mile back to the shelter to wait it out. The trail has been a slippery, muddy, dangerous mess with all of the rain but the scenery around here really is phenomenal.I'll add that Overmountain shelter was also really cool- it's an old barn that has had its hay loft converted to fit 20+ sleeping bodies. Though I did lose one of my earplugs in the dark while getting ready to lie down and had to listen to a barn load of snoring.

I ate ten slices on a bench in the parking lot, with a pint of whole milk to wash it down, saving two slices to be carried for later.
What perfect fuel for the day's challenge: That morning, I talked with two separate local hikers who warned me about Pond Mountain, over which the trail abruptly gains and then loses about 1600 feet in elevation. The first hiker, a southbound sectioner out for two weeks, described a brutal slope over loose, grapefruit-sized rocks. The second, a woman who has hiked most of the trail from GA to NC (and survived a close brush with a rattlesnake on the AT in GA) said she has been avoiding doing the mountain.

This was a mistake. The nights since have been cold and wet and I've been freezing.

I decided with all of this to go into Marion for the night to figure something out. At the Marion Walmart I bought some heavier fleece and a needle and thread for a grand total of $15. After getting some sewing pointers from Debbie in the fabrics department, I set out to craft a new bag back at the motel. It turned out pretty well and feels like it will be warm.

Actually I loved almost every day of Virginia. It's just been really hard to find time to get on here and update as my miles have ramped up and I've started hiking later on in the day. Some of the highlights of Virginia: Knocking out the ""VA Triple Crown"" - Dragon's Tooth, McAffee Knob, and Tinker Cliffs - in three days, with a visit to the incredible, all-you-can-eat Homeplace Restaurant in Catawba in between. In exchange for that ride to trail days a couple weeks back, former thru hiker Happy Feet made everyone in the car promise to get up and watch the sunrise at McAffee Knob. So, upholding our end of the bargain, Smurf, Turtle, and I camped just below and got up at 5:30 AM to see it. What a life changing experience, watching the sun slowly illuminate the sleepy, cloud-filled valleys below.The incredible hospitality shown by friends old and new in Virginia: Tim and Bonnie Dayton and the summer 2016 staff of REACH hosted myself and my two hiking partners for two nights for some much needed R&R in Roanoke. REACH is Tim's non-profit community service organization in Roanoke which I worked for just out of college in 2013. Wes and Nadine, friends of Smurf and Turtle also gave us a place to stay when it was sorely needed. Turtle had gotten sick and I could barely hike due to blisters on my heels (Read more below). They drove over an hour to pick us up, brought us to their home in Forest, VA, and took us to Cracker Barrel and out to run errands. Nadine also used her nurse powers to supervise some intense blister popping and bandaging. Gross!And to wrap up the saga of my destroyed Keen boots: In Roanoke I rode a borrowed bike for an hour to the Sportsmen's Wearhouse in town. There I decided on a pair of low-cut Merrell Capra boots. Unfortunately, they tore up my feet pretty bad - huge blisters on my ankles forced that zero day in Forest, VA. The boots then only made it about eight days before the bottom began to separate on the left one. I'll be contacting Merrell soon to try and get my money back so stay tuned. In the mean time, I'll be buying a pair of trail runners once the Merrells totally fall apart (they have made it into Pennsylvania at the time of writing).

Climbing the next mountain after that was about the hottest I have been on the trail yet. A shocking amount of sweat was pouring off of me and I collapsed exhausted at the top of the climb as dark clouds started to gather in the sky. Thunder started getting close and frequent and I was pretty nervous about hiking through a thunderstorm at this elevation so I set up my tent in a somewhat sheltered spot and climbed in as rain started to fall. I could have kept going because there wasn't as much lightning as I was expecting but it was a nice break and, best of all, I stayed dry.

The outfitter was more focused on high end clothing than actual gear, and an employee sort of followed me around the store while I browsed around. I bought a small bottle of DEET spray for ticks as the bug spray I had been using had run out and then walked to the grocery store. People in the store seemed to be staring at me but I think I smelled abnormally terrible with how much I had been sweating the past few days.Back on the AT I knocked out a gorgeous but unbelievably buggy section of trail along the Housatonic River.

I feel weak and very worn down. I have decided to abandon my plan of making it all the way to Stratton, ME for the Labor Day Florida State football opening game against Ole Miss and instead take it slow and aim to be in Rangeley for it. I think that the slower rate of hiking will let me enjoy things a little bit more and will help me recover a bit physically and mentally.I stopped tonight at the Baldplate shelter just a mile or two past Grafton notch, setting my tent up in a cleared spot off the shelter side trail. As I wrote in my journal right around dusk, I started hearing something stomping through the underbrush and a noise like bark being stripped off of trees. Listening and not making a sound, I realized that the noise was something big ripping up grasses up nearby and chewing them. Daring to unzip my tent, I shone my headlamp around but it seemed that the visitor was just around the bend in the trail. I leaned further out, grabbed my crocs, and clapped them together loudly. Whatever it was went clomping off towards the AT. I'm not sure, but I think I had a close call with a moose. I've had a lot of deer come visiting around campsites on this trip but this thing sounded big!","Bull Branch Campsite

The conversation turned to the sad story of thru hiker ""Inchworm"" who went missing from the AT in Maine in 2013. Her body was discovered in 2015 and it was found that she had left the trail to use the bathroom and couldn't find her way back. Another hiker had joined our conversation told us that Inchworm had actually gone off trail very close to the area we were in.

Light rain blew through occasionally but the clouds were mostly higher allowing for some great views.

A handful of day hikers were up there but I was the only thru hiker. I paused to snap a picture of the last white blaze, dropped my pack, and then turned my focus to the summit sign. For more than a year I had dreamed of seeing this sign in person. I had seen it in thousands of pictures and read about it in trail journals and books. Now it was in front of me and I was instantly overwhelmed. I walked towards it, put a hand on it, and closed my eyes with an uncontrollable smile on my face as tears started to come. I stood there for a minute or two and then stepped away and sat down nearby, looking at the sign and crying for a few minutes more. Once I felt a little bit put together, I asked some of the hikers up top to take some pictures of me.I think that I mainly felt empty and accomplished coming back down Katahdin. The tears up top were purely joy and I guess I can't say that I was overly sad that the trail was over. Despite plenty of joys and accomplishments and diversions along the way, it was, simply put, a very hard six months of effort and sacrifice and focus. I guess knowing that I had plenty more adventures to come in the next day, the next week, and the next few months helped a lot.

Would use again or look at a lighter weight option such as ULA Circuit or Granite Gear Crown 60 (The pack I often saw on the trail and wished I had).
Tent - MSR Nook with homemade heavy duty plastic groundtarp which I trimmed down a few times. Tent was non-functional by end of hike due to cracked poles, mildewed seam tape, and water intrusion. Replaced in full by MSR. Would use this set up again unless I could spring for one of the pricier Big Agnes tents.
Bag - Mountain Hardwear ExtraLamina 20 Deg. Still fully functional aside from stubborn stank. Would use again or look into an Enlightened Equipment Down Quilt.
Warm Weather Bag - Hand sewn flannel bag with Thermolite reactor liner. Eventually cut down to be just a flannel blanket used over the liner. Not an optimal system but it was cheap and it got me through. 
Pad - ThermARest ProLite Plus. Mostly functional. Doesn't really self inflate anymore. Would look into smaller pad- The extra long and extra wide style wasn't at all necessary and took up a lot of room in my pack.
Boots - Oboz Scapegoats Low. EXCELLENT boots. In good shape after hiking some of toughest parts of the trail. My boot progression was Keen Mashall Mids to Merrell Capras (awful) to Oboz Scapegoats. I would absolutely buy these again although maybe with a high ankle. Oboz would be my first recommendation for thru hike boots. Stay away from Merrell.
Stove - MSR Pocket Rocket. Still mostly functional. The self ignition became unreliable requiring a lighter occasionally.
Water - Smart Water Bottle into Sawyer Squeeze into single 1L Camelbak Chute bottle. The filter lasted the whole trip but is probably ready to be replaced. Would use this whole set up again. I got rid of the MSR Sweetwater antiviral Perchlorate drops somewhere around Vermont when the water sources became mostly springs again. They came in handy a few times in the mid-Atlantic states but are probably not necessary if you are trying to go super lightweight. The Camelbak bottle needed a replacement cap holder assembly at the end of the trip which was provided by Camelbak after a quick phone call.Entertainment / Other - I got rid of the Baby Taylor guitar in Virginia, trading it out for my water-resistant Pentax K-50 DSLR which my parents brought up to me. It just got to be annoying to worry about keeping the guitar dry and not-stolen but I truly valued having it for hostel jams and fire-side practice. Aside from the weight, I really loved having the DSLR but wished I had a backpack strap mount for it (See the Peak Design Capture Camera Clip) so that it would be more quickly available for quick wildlife encounters. For the camera I used a battery adapter which took four AA batteries. Smurf and Turtle gave me a small Anker phone charger in July for my birthday which I carried for the rest of the trail. It really came in handy especially because my iPhone 5C would very quickly lose charge in cooler weather.

It's currently the fourth day of 2016. If you can't tell reading through, I stopped updating my online journal from the trail somewhere around the midpoint of the AT in Pennsylvania. I feel bad, but as my daily mileages got higher and I often hiked right up to dusk, it just became too much of a time and energy commitment to get onto my phone and update everyone here. After stopping for the night I usually had time just to set up my tent, slather on some bug spray, hang a bear line, and cook some dinner before it was ""hiker midnight"" and the day's exhaustion had me crawling into my tent.What I did do however, was more or less religiously keep a paper journal. I would pull it out from my pack during a lunch break or while dinner was cooking and jot down an entry. Where I started the day, where I ended, points of interest or funny stories from the day. A lot of personal doubt and frustration.
And so now, three months after climbing Katahdin, I've finally finished transferring the highlights over for your enjoyment and reference. I've also included some of the photos I took on the camera that I traded my travel guitar out for in Shenandoah NP.
While I feel really bad about leaving my earlier followers hanging, my main motivation for going back and finishing this journal was so that others planning their AT or other long hike can have a source of information about what to expect. I personally spent about half a year on Trailjournals.com (and many other websites) starting in 2015 when the idea of hiking the trail worked its way into my mind. Some of my favorites were the trail journals of ""3D"", ""BonBon"", and ""Affirm"". Those three hikers truly made my preparation for the trail easier, and helped move my thru hike from a day dream to a sweaty, awesome reality.
