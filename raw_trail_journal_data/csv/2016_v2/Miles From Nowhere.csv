Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546884,"After we got here yesterday, we drove back to the location where I got off the trail last year when I got injured (four miles down a dirt road). Ran into a thru-hiker and ended up taking him into town for food resupply. Jumped on the trail and hiked a little 0.8 mile section. It was late until we got back from dinner. Slept well last night. Staying at the Nestlewood Inn, a beautiful bed and breakfast. Our gracious hosts made us a nice breakfast sandwich with sausage and eggs, browned potatoes, and a yogurt and fruit parfait. Delicious. Drove the four miles down the dirt road again and hit the trail at 9:00. First mile to Crocker Cirque campsite wasn't bad and I made good time. The next mile however to the top of South Crocker Mountain was very hard for me even though I was carrying my lighter pack. I was doing a lot of talking to myself. A number of hikers passed me in that section, going both ways. Stopped for a Jif snack bar on top and met another hiker, Taco. Had a half mile down and a half mile back up to get to North Crocker Mt. The next five plus miles was all downhill so I was much happier. Chatted with a gentleman lying just off the trail. Turned out to be the legendary Warren Doyle who I might add has hiked the trail 17 times. He was doing a van assisted hike for a group of hikers through New Hampshire and Maine. A half a mile before the end of my hike, ""Miles From Nowhere"" by Cat Stevens played on my ipod bringing a smile to my face and tears to my eyes. Made it down to my trail angel at 3:40 who was waiting with my mt dew. Shower and dinner followed by working on my full pack for tomorrow. And playing with water filters. My water filter was not working so Side had driven an hour each way this morning to find me a mini Sawyer Squeeze so I would have something for the upcoming days. He is too good to this hiker.","Caribou Pond Road

Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547282,"Happy Anniversary to the Trahans!!This was the first day with my full pack so was feeling anxious about that. Slept well though. Got up at 6:00 and started filling my pack. We went down for coffee at 7:00 but no one was around. Finally at 7:27 called our hosts and David showed up in a few minutes. He made us up some breakfast and then off to the trail. Started hiking at 8:45. My pack felt like 3 tons. The plan was to only do 4.3 miles since my pack was heavy and the trail was lots of up. It had been sprinkling in the parking lot so Side put my pack cover on for me. The beginning of the hike was buggy with little breeze. Side had sprayed me with bug spray so I was good except for my ears. Took several rest stops along the way for drinks and snacks. Today's trail at least did have some short flat sections. Not gonna lie - it was a tough hike for me. I hate this having to get ready for the trail again every year. Takes me so long to get my trail legs. Had several nice viewpoints out to the mountains and down to the pond. Met a college group out hiking and camping. Got to the shelter a little before two. Stopped at the day hiker shelter to eat something and decided I should just stay here tonight. Water, privy, and tentsites. What more could I ask for. Reminding myself how to set up camp. Didn't carry my stove for this segment to reduce weight so it's cold food tonight. Filtered water so I can drink up tonight. Did a lot of sweating today. Covered buckets at the tentsites for food storage because the squirrels are so bad at sneaking your food. Feels like I packed a picnic lunch for a bear. There is a caretaker tent here so there may be someone here tonite or it may just be me. Time will tell. Oh here's a hiker planning to stay. Took a walk down to the pond. Supper is a packet of tuna, the one with sun-dried tomatoes, and a couple of slices of provolone in a pita pocket. Tasted pretty good. Had more hikers show up.","Route 27, Carrabassett Valley, Maine

Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547289,"Got up early and was on the trail at 7:15. I'm climbing for the next few days in the Bigelow Range. Started with a steep 650 foot climb to South Horn. Then dropped down about 500 feet and back up a steep climb of 800 feet to Bigelow Mountain West. Gorgeous 270-degree views out over mountains and beautiful views down to the lake with its many islands. Dropped down 400 feet passing Avery Memorial Campsite and climbed another 300 feet to Avery Peak. Both these mountains were above treeline. The views from Avery were 360-degree and completely breathtaking. Think that ties with my other very favorite spot on the trail, Franconia Ridge in New Hampshire. Now all that climbing only means one thing. An 1800 foot steep trail down to Safford Notch Campsite where I'm stopping for the night. Would have liked to go on but best for my body to take it easy these first days carrying my heavy pack. Ran into Warren Doyle and some of his hikers, Peppermint and Papa Bear. Others passed but I didn't get their names. There are many hikers in the woods. Many day and weekend hikers are here to enjoy the Bigelows and many section and thru-hikers. So far just Travis here tonight. More may show up like last night close to dark and after dark. There was a steady stream past my tent for a while last night. Today was just a beautiful day weather-wise. Cold supper again without my stove.","Horns Pond Lean-to

Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547291,"There ended up being two college groups at the campsite making about 25 total. I spent a couple of hours at the campfire chatting with Travis. Must have had my air mattress adjusted just right because I slept very well. Up and on the trail at 7:15. Had what I thought was going to be an easier day climbing Little Bigelow Mountain - but remember I'm in Maine. The first 5 miles were mostly rocks, roots, and long slanted rock slabs. Very hard on my feet and knees. So glad the rocks slabs were dry or it would have been treacherous. Had to be creative getting up and down big rocks a couple of times and did a few butt slides over some tall rocks to safely get down. Seemed like a really long 5 miles. Passed Peppermint going the other way. Had one more mile that was easy. Side was doing trail magic again. While I was eating lunch with him, Siddhartha ambled in. Gave him some extra food I had. Then I slackpacked another 2.8 miles where Side was waiting again. Got back to the inn and grabbed all my dirty clothes and ran to the laundramat. Got in a few phone calls during the wash cycle. Side took me back for a shower during the dry cycle. Ran out to a fantastic dinner at Sugarloaf's restaurant. Back to the room to repack and make decisions about what I need from this point forward. Exhausting evening because I was so tired. Went to bed way past hiker midnight which is 8:00. Getting up at 5:30 to get me on the trail early so that I have a chance to make the canoe ferry across the Kennebec River the next day (it only runs from 9:00 to 2:00). That's all, folks.","Stafford Notch Campsite

Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547387,"Forgot to mention that my hubby took me out to a fantastic dinner last night. Salmon, local potato puree, maple glazed roasted brussel sprouts. Just tasted so great. Slept so poorly. Had a lot on my mind. Adding more weight to my pack - stove, long pants, wool hat. Would I be able to carry it all. Stayed with my lighter sleeping bag. Hope the weather cooperates. Early start at 7:15 by skipping breakfast at the inn. Ate in the car and Side dropped me off at the trailhead and headed out for a 7.5 hour ride home. Sad for me. Wet trail this morning but 800 foot uphill so not so dangerous. Cool but humid at the beginning. West Carry Pond had whitecaps even though not that breezy out. Came 3.5 miles by 9:30 to West Carry Pond lean-to and zipped on by. I was hoping to make 13 miles today to Pierce Pond Lean-to. Long for me at this point but not a lot of climbing so I was hopeful. But again there were a lot of the usual obstacles that slow you down and also everything was so slick. There were lots of puncheons and two long boardwalks during the day. The boards get so slippery when wet. I avoided a slanted board because it looked dangerous and then slid on a rock and went flailing about but managed to stay upright. Geez, I was trying to be so careful. Walked around the end of East Carry Pond.Stopped at a stream 0.1 miles before the shelter and lugged two bags of water along with my pack. When I got to the camping area I was sure glad I had. The only water source was the pond which was down a steep bank. I pitched my tent up on the hill. Several others are here also. It was really breezy when I was setting up but now that it's almost dark it is quieting down. Guess I'll be warm tonight afterall. Today was definitely easier hiking compared to the Bigelows. Crashing early tonight. Only 4 miles to the Kennebec River crossing and the town of Caratunk where I'm spending the night and picking up my resupply box that Side drove over for me. When he was here he was driving all over creation to get things for me. He had to go home and rest. Ha.","Long Falls Dam Road
",Pierce Pond Lean-to,"Aug 29, Mon",13.50
Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547503,"Very quiet at the shelter last night. I didn't go down to the lean-to but saw two folks down the hill and one camped on top like me. Had a great night's sleep. Up and on the trail at 7:15. Seems to be my normal time. Short 4 mile hike today. Walked along and crossed a number of streams. Got to the Kennebec River and waited for the canoe to come get me to cross. It's a dangerous crossing because anytime they can let water out upstream, the water can rise rapidly. A person died crossing years ago so the ATC funds a person to take you across in a canoe. Forgot to look for the white blaze in the bottom of the canoe. Darn. Missed a photo op. Had to walk about a quarter of a mile to get to a free phone to call for my ride to the Sterling Inn, my residence for the night. No cell phone coverage in these parts. Another lovely day. Called again and still no one came so I had to walk down. Made me a grumpy person. Got my supply box and sat on the porch sorting and eating lunch. Chatted with two hikers there and calmed down. Eventually decided to stay and checked in, showered, did laundry. The inn has all the amenities a hiker needs. Went out to dinner with two other hikers. Early to bed. Supposed to have some rain tomorrow. My next section to Monson is 36 miles.","Pierce Pond Lean-to
","Caratunk, Maine","Aug 30, Tue",4
Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547686,"I heard rain for quite a while last night. Fifty percent chance of rain for tomorrow and tomorrow night. Ick. Breakfast at 6:30. Yogurt, bowl of cereal, blueberry muffin, juice and coffee. A little slow getting out of the inn today. Got a ride to the trailhead and got on the trail at 8:00. I had slept poorly worrying about this and that (the weight of my pack, maybe I should have sent my stove home to save weight). Brace yourself, old girl. At least tomorrow there will be one less day of food in the pack. I was in a very good frame of mind by the time I started hiking. The first 6 miles was a climb I could handle. The slope wasn't too steep. I crossed several gravel roads. Stopped off at Pleasant Pond lean-to looking for the privy which wasn't easy to find. It had a notice (brown alert) that it was closed until a new one is built in 2018. Great. I don't think I can wait that long. Then there was a steep climb to Pleasant Pond Mountain (didn't think it was all that pleasant). There were several false rocky top summits. Very nice views. I had sweated up a storm so I got chilly on the way down and had to put on my rain jacket. After a bigger number of false rocky top de-summits, got too hot and had to take off the jacket. Stopped and had lunch on a log. It was a long climb down and things (rocks, roots, rock slabs) were still a little wet from last night's rain. As I inched down one side of a rock slab another hiker came down the other side and slid, followed by his fellow hiker whose hand he grabbed but she slid off also. Young - so just headed on their way. If that had been me I would have been in traction. Had a rock crossing across a wide stream. Side knows this is dangerous for me but I managed to not get wet.   Firestarter and her Father (first day out joining her for a few days) came along as I was getting water from the pond and mentioned that there was supposed to be water ahead at a stream 0.2 mile ahead but my app said it was dry. She jaunted up the trail to check (oh to be young) but it was dry. She scoped out a couple of stealth sites for us to camp. Set up the tent quickly because it was starting to sprinkle. Hung the bear bag, filtered water and cooked up my dinner but it started to rain before I was done so I had to grab everything and get it under the vestibule . Spaghetti and meatballs in the tent. Short rain. Good night, I'm pooped.","Caratunk, Maine
",Campsite just past Moxie Pond,"Aug 31, Wed",12
Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547702,"Ended up being a long while of thunder and lightning last night. Ended about 10:00. So although it wasn't particularly threatening, it was noisy enough to hinder sleeping. In the morning had to shammy the tent to remove some of the water so it wasn't so heavy. In one of the recent days I tore a hole in the butt of my shorts. Good thing everybody is looking down all the time. I have pants but it's too hot to wear them. Climbing Moxie Bald Mt today, 1650 feet up. Crossed paths with Firestarter and Father several times during the day. The top of the bald had medium-sized pines around the outside edges but the flat interior was all low shrubs and white stick trees a couple feet high, mixed in with rock slabs. Nice views and then back down. I knew I wasn't going to make 15 miles to the next shelter so stopped at the west branch of the Piscataquis River and set up camp. Another hiker was there. Easy to get water to filter. Ran a little late as I finished around camp. It was getting dark when I went to hang my food where I had thrown the bear bag. As I pulled it up - snap- down came everything. Great. So much fun to throw the bear bag in the dark with your headlamp on. All the trees have miniscule little short branches. Had to resort to a broken tree trunk with the top part leaning on another tree. Not the best but it had to do.","Campsite just past Moxie Pond
",Campsite at West Branch of Piscataquis River,"Sep 01, Thu",12.80
Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547705,"Had a somewhat restless night. My air mattress wasn't just right and my tent was a little sloped. Just couldn't get comfy. So it was easy to get up and going. It was a little colder so I moved right along at camp. Breakfast was 3 different types of bars. Found these new cheesecake ones that taste pretty good on the trail. Ready and going at 7:10. Crossed the river on stones and began what looked like an easier day. Ha. Maine has no easy days. The terrain looked pretty flat at the beginning but the trail had so many PUDS (pointless ups and downs). Down to the River, up the hill, down to the river, up the hill. Geez. Three miles in at the turnoff to Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to, I ran into a couple Crasher and Rocky. Realized they had started the trail 2 days after us in 2013 and we had met them then. Small world, I say. At 5.3 miles got to the east branch of the Piscataquis River. Switched to my crocs and waded across. It was up to the bottom of my kneecap but the current was not strong so it was easy. Freezing water but felt good on the feet. There was a rope strung across but I didn't need it. Crossed quite a few dirt roads today. Ran into Lacy, the ridge runner and chatted a bit. She was going along the trail removing fire rings that people had created. The last third of the trail was a climb that didn't look like bad elevation but I was really dragging. I just wanted to get to the road and call for my ride, but seemed like I'd never get there. At the parking lot I ran into Peppermint (of the Doyle gang) again. She gave me a big hug. She must have hiked south and would now jump way ahead. My ride came so I had to race off. Came to Shaw's Lodging, picked a private room in a separate building because I really need to be able to sleep and rest when I want. I can go out and hang with others if I want. Ran into Garnet Turtle and Humdinger who I met recently at Sterling Inn. Took a shower right away. Spent at least half an hour trying to comb out my hair. Big mistake not bringing my tiny bottle of Pantene. The combined shampoo/conditioner just doesn't work for my hair. AJ, who picked me up at the trailhead, brought me a foot bath with hot Epsom salt water and I soaked my poor feet a good long while. Did laundry. Talked to Poet, one of the hosts, and will meet tomorrow to talk about options for the 100-mile wilderness. The folks who work here are all so kind. Went down to Lakeshore House to meet other hikers for dinner. Took forever to get our food. Felt dazed like my head might hit the table at any moment. Food was delicious. Drank 3 very large glasses of water trying to catch up for not having had enough to drink today. Called Side to catch up with life at home. Nice to have a chance to talk to him for a bit. Couldn't wait to climb into my bed. Got that? Bed. Ahhhh.","Campsite at West Branch of Piscataquis River

Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548655,"Slept well in my big double bed. Very quiet because I'm in a separate house from most everybody else. Somehow the day disappeared without me even getting to take a nap. Went down for a fabulous breakfast. Somehow they feed up all the hikers in a big hurry. Bacon, 3 eggs as you like them, fantastic home fries, coffee, oj, and blueberry pancakes which I was always too full to even eat. Got my mail drop and had to incorporate all that stuff into my pack. Lunch down at the bakery. Had a chicken salad sandwich with chopped up dried cranberries. It was so delicious. Also a mint chocolate chip milkshake made with Gifford's homemade ice cream. Oh my goodness. I was supposed to meet with Poet at 10:00 to make plans for the wilderness. Then he wasn't available until 2:00. Then he wasn't available until later. Finally hours later Hippie Chick helped Garnet Turtle and me plan out the next days. So as always a hectic zero day with little rest.","Maine 15, Munson - Shaw's Lodging

Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547817,"Slept so wonderfully. Been a while since I slept that good. Went up to breakfast at 6:45. Filled my belly. Hiking today with Garnet Turtle, a hiker my age. By the time we took the back roads to the beginning spot of our hike and hiked up 0.8 miles to get to the trail, it was 9:15. Late start. Maybe breakfast wasn't a good idea.   Talked with a few hikers we passed and then decided no more time for that with our long hike. Then we passed a sign for trail magic in memory of Yogi Bear 1/8 a mile down a side road. Felt we should stop in support. A father doing trail magic to honor his 47 year old son who used to do a lot of trail magic himself but died. He has a small cabin there with a beautiful view up to the mountains. We only stayed long enough to drink a soda and talk a few minutes. Since we were doing a southbound slackpack today, we kept passing hikers from Shaw's. Tried to just say hi, tell them there was trail magic ahead and keep going. At Big Wilson Stream we had to don the crocs to cross. Not a bad ford. By that time we realized we were really going to have to zip to make it out before dark. Stopped for a 10 minute lunch, stopped once to filter water and that was about it. This darn Maine does not have nice hiking trails. This was a test to see if we might be able to hike together through the wilderness but I was sure a drain on Garnet Turtle who's been on the trail longer and in addition is a runner. Maine just has so little nice trail that it is brutal. We pushed. I gasped. We pushed. I gasped. You get the idea. Managed to make it out of the woods just before dark. Not sure what the next plan will be. Glad to have gotten 15 miles out of the way but think tomorrow is going to be a zero day. The next 15 mile section we were considering doing is even worse. Back to the drawing board to plan. Sleeping in tomorrow.","Otter Pond Parking

Walked down to the bakery with Garnet Turtle and GPS. Had the special - a cheese sauce with sliced hard boiled eggs and chunks of ham over toasted homemade oat bread. Also got a raspberry muffin but I was too full so it was my lunch. Had to move out of my single room and into the bunkroom with 6 others. It's a spacious room and there are no bunk beds so it's nice. The place is packed tonight because of the holiday. Spent a couple hours today with Garnet Turtle replanning the rest of the hike. Needed to make the necessary arrangements for rides and food drops. Needed to let Side know so he could make arrangements for when he comes up at the end. Then I had to get my food separated out for each of the segments. Might have been more exhausting than hiking. I wanted to get down for a Gifford's milkshake but ran out of time. They had a picnic here tonight with red Maine hotdogs, corn on the grill, watermelon and big cookies. Nice treat.

Tonight I have to remember the ibuprofen. Up early because the place was packed last night. 35 total. And a lot of them wanted breakfast. We had an early shuttle so needed to be one of the first fed. We ran a little late with breakfast because of the crowd so a little late on the shuttle too. Had to stop and pay at a gate to let us in to our destination. Still got on the trail about 9:00. We had to hike in 1.4 miles on Third Mountain Trail to get to the trail (no, that doesn't count). Climbed Mount Three and a Half. Fourth Mountain was higher. Dropped down to Fourth Mountain Bog and walked across a lot of boards thankfully. Climbed 700 feet up Barren Mountain where there were remains of a fire tower. Ran into about 15 hikers during the day all coming north and I've got to say from the looks of most of them I'm glad I was slackpacking. One gentleman was new to hiking and carrying a 55 pound pack through the wilderness. Cringe. Had to be down at 4:00 for our shuttle so started down the 1600 foot descent. Parts of the trail today were half decent. Had a beautiful view when we got down to Barren Ledges. Realized we were going to be a little late for our shuttle so called from on top to warn that we'd be down at 4:15 since there is no cell service at the bottom. Had some rocky spots coming down. Got to the end of our hike having to hike 0.8 miles down a side trail to our pickup point. By almost 5:00 our ride still hadn't come. At this point we had no water and were getting a bit antsy. Turned on the phone and was amazed to have enough service to put in another call and we were picked up shortly after. Back for the usual shower, laundry, race to dinner. Then we had to pack up our backpacks which will be delivered to us at the end of tomorrow's slackpack and a bucket of food that will be delivered to us in the wilderness on Saturday.

Gary took us to the trail again. He's such a nice guy - another one of the amazing Shaw team. We had to hike up 1.4 miles to get to the trail again. Now there's a waste of feet. The Crow rode out with us and hike tagged with us. We hiked Monument Cliff, then Columbus Mountain and finally Chairback Mountain. Had two lovely sections of rerouted trail that was soft and springy on the feet. Welcome relief for sure. We hiked down a long steep section of gigantic rocks. Sketchy. Had lunch on top of Chairback and then hurried on down to Katahdin Ironworks Road where our full packs were being delivered at 3:00. Made it down 20 minutes early and found some trail magic done by a young lady who had just finished the trail and her father. Had a yoohoo from her and then Poet also brought us a drink when he dropped off our packs. Hiked down another 0.3 miles to a campsite just before the river.

Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548665,"When I woke up I was dreaming I was taking a bite of a chocolate cupcake. Geez. Food, family and home are always on the mind out here. I was the first one in camp to start moving but of course not the first out. Garnet Turtle had a mouse or red squirrel attack her food bag in the tree so she had to deal with that. Gross. Walked down to the blue-blazed trail that we heard led to a privy in the parking lot on KI Road. A well-timed privy. Priceless. I know you're thinking - hey I thought you were in the wilderness - what's with all the roads. Some of the roads are logging roads or privately owned so you have to pay to use them. Keep in mind - there are no stores for resupply and not many cars on these dirt roads so that leaves you out in the wild. A number of folks are carrying all their food for the 100-mile wilderness. If I was doing that, you'd find me along the trail somewhere. My pack weighs a ton with just 3 days of foods. Today we were planning to stay at a campsite with essentially no water so had to lug it up 1.8 miles. This body was tired at the top. After leaving this morning, we had to cross the West Branch of the Pleasant River. I chose to switch to crocs and walk through the water rather than slip off one of the rocks that were too far apart and too wet and mossy for these short legs. The cold water felt wonderful on the feet and the water didn't come much above ankle depth. The Crow decided to take the rocks and slipped off one dipping his boot in the water. That would have been me if I tried. Passed the turnoff to Gulf Hagas Trail which leads to a gorge with beautiful waterfalls (the Niagara Falls of Maine). Didn't have time or energy for that 5.2 mile loop. Kept climbing 2000 feet in total with one stop at a shelter for lunch and to filter water. then continued to the top of Gulf Hagas Mountain. Sent a couple of quick texts to Side to let him know all was okay. Got a lovely email from Jillian and Robert, my grandchildren. Made me tear up. They are back in school now. Oh gosh, it's fall. Better hike faster. Had some sprinkles today but not bad. When we got to Sydney Tappan Campsite after a 7 mile total, we found The Crow already set up. Got to spend a little time chatting around the non-burning campfire. Saw gigantic moose prints in the mud not far from our tents. Hope it has moved on. Mountain House beef stroganoff and a Hershey bar made a nice dinner plus The Crow gave me a little coffee to warm up. The sun never came out today so made for good hiking but I was sweating so much from the big climb that I froze when we stopped. Tomorrow we have a 9 mile hike across West Peak, Hay Mountain and White Cap Mountain. Will be quite a rocky climb. Then we drop down 2400 feet to the shelter for tomorrow night. This will be the last really big climb until Katahdin at the end. Looking forward to the flat trail that comes in the second half of the wilderness. Just 3 in camp tonight."," Campsite Near West Branch Pleasant River

Not sure if they were any wetter after the rain than after hiking. It was my turn to have my food bag attacked in the tree. I think it's these darn red squirrels. Fortunately he only got into my garbage bag but now I have a hole in my food bag. I'm not happy. The Crow gave me a technique to try using a plastic bag above the food bag on the line. We'll see if it works. Out of camp at 8 o'clock.First climb was a steep 700 foot climb up to West Peak. As always the ups are hard for me. Then we had a swoop down and up to Hay Mountain. Then back down and finally up to White Cap Mountain. All in all I did okay. We were able to see Katahdin from a viewpoint. Put in a call to Side to let him know all is ok.

Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548684,"Thank goodness it didn't rain last night - I had camped in a little gully. Woke up at 4:30 and decided it was too early. Woke up with a start at 5:45. I had been dreaming that I was at some kind of hospital because of problems from hiking and they had given me, in addition to some meds, three animals and one was big along with pens for them. And I was busy figuring out how to get them to take the animals back because I didn't want them. Anyone who knows what kind of dreams I have can appreciate the weirdness. Packed up and was ready to get on the trail at 7:30. We had a commitment to be 12 miles by 3 o'clock to get our food drop. So I left Camp before Garnet Turtle because she hikes faster uphill. By the end of the first 3.5 miles to the top of Little Boardman Mountain Garnet Turtle caught up to me. Had a chance to send a text to Side with our location. The trail for the rest of the day was all downhill. What a relief for me. And the trail is improving and not so hard on the feet. Stopped at the Cooper Brook Falls lean-to to filter water and for lunch. Someone thought they recognized me and turns out it was Standing Indian and also Breaking Badger who Side and I had done trail magic for in New York. I had told some of those people not to be surprised if they saw me in Maine. Handed out some extra food to them. We jaunted down to Jo - Mary Road to get our food drop right on time. AJ from Shaw's delivered. It was nice because I hadn't gotten to say goodbye to him when I left there - he had a couple of days off. He brought us a drink in addition to our food. My backpack had seemed heavy today even though it shouldn't have been because my food weight was lessening. Well it was good and heavy after adding three days of food. Hiked another four miles to Antlers campsite for a total of 16 miles today. Will my feet recover? Late getting into camp and there were already many tents set up. We finally found something passable and began the process. We're right on the lake so really pretty. It got dark before I was done for the night. Never did get a bear bag hung. It kept catching in the little wispy branches on the pine tree. I was lucky I got it back down. Hope the pesky red squirrels leave me alone. It started to rain lightly so I jumped in the tent. Hope we don't get much rain - not the best site for rain. We'll see what excitement the night brings.","East Branch Lean-to

Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548688,"It rained just a little bit at bedtime and then there was just a gentle breeze all night so the tent was dry in the morning. Check the weather in the morning and realized rain and thunderstorms were predicted so we changed our plan again. Instead of hiking 12 miles as planned we changed to 7 miles. Figured that would give us time to get to a hostel, White House Landing, to beat the rain. Lucky to have cell service at the lake. Called and made a reservation. The owner said rain was predicted for noon so we should make it. Well the thunder began at 10 o'clock and by 10:30 it was raining and storming so we got good and wet before we got to the hostel. Got to Pemadimcook Lake and called for boat pickup. Told him on the phone that his two drowned rats had arrived. I had worn my pants for the first time and they weighed a ton or two. We were shivering by the time he got to us. Took a quick shower and made it for lunch. A huge cheeseburger, chips, two Mountain Dews. So delicious. Then began the process of drying everything out. No washer or dryer here. There's a hand pump down by the lake and large galvanized tubs and washboards for washing clothes and a clothesline. Lucked out and the sun came out and it was windy as could be. At least I got some of the perspiration out of the clothes. Had my boots out drying in the sun and was on the phone with Side when the dog took a boot and ran off. I about had a heart attack. My heart was beating like crazy. Just what I needed was to be walking in one boot and one croc. After many attempts of trying to distract the dog, he finally gave it up. I was shaking for a long time. Needless to say I never left my boots again. Oh, and totally forgot I was on the phone with Side.Finally got most everything dried out. Time for dinner. Homemade pizzas and a brownie. Now where does all the time go. Didn't even get to prop up my feet. I was able to make a few phone calls home. But boots never dried and are still soaked. Not how I wanted to start out tomorrow especially since now we have a longer hike from cutting today short. Goodness. Having a battle doing uphills of any size. I think I'm just tired. Hoping lots of food and a hearty breakfast in the morning will help. Feeling like a slug. Trail was mostly flat but still many roots and rocks so makes it slow going. Sigh. Coming to the end soon. Two more days in the 100-Mile wilderness. Donated more food to The Crow and Griz who were in the hostel with us. They were happy and my load was lighter so I was happy too. The owners have run this place for 25 years. It's up on the hill and they're have a number of cottages. All looking down to the lake. Clean privy called ""The Oval Office"". Forgot to mention the privy yesterday at Antlers Campsite. It's a double privy with a cribbage game between the two seats. Chose to forego the game and do a solo in the privy.","Antlers Campsite

Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548690,"Four of us in the bunkhouse. Other hikers in other buildings as well. Slept well but it was chilly. The Crow and Griz started rousing about 6 o'clock. Breakfast was family style at 7:30 sharp with coffee at 7:15 so with hungry hikers around don't come late. So I climbed out shortly after 6 and then Garnet Turtle. I spent a lot of time yesterday unloading extra food to others who were short of food. I felt like my pack was in much better shape. Coffee, OJ, scrambled eggs, crispy bacon just like I like it, blueberry pancakes, English muffin with homemade grape jelly. Full tummy when I left. There were 10 hikers to whisk back across the water. We were in the second batch. Had a 0.2 mile hike back to the trail then hoped for a big day to help compensate for the miles we couldn't do yesterday. The first 6 miles were pretty flat. It was a gorgeous day for hiking - cool with a breeze. There were several miles of bumpy, rocky, rooty trail. Then a 700-foot up that was steep. I was feeling strong today even doing well on the uphills. After Nesuntabunt mountain there was a nice viewpoint of Mount Katahdin. Very commanding. Took some good photos and continued on. Hiked past and along ponds many times. As we came to the trail to Pollywog Gorge neither of us realized that we had veered off the AT. Went downhill a bit to a dropoff to the gorge. Yikes. Realized that probably wasn't the trail. Although later in the day I would have been glad to jump off. About 4 o'clock I started having pain in my left hip - sort of like a knife stuck in there. Took a few vitamin I but it didn't touch the pain. Had to just keep hiking. Ran out of water about four miles from the shelter we were shooting for. Hadn't had enough to drink during the day but I didn't want to take time out to filter. Just trying to get to our lean-to and set up camp. The pain was brutal with every step of the left foot. Got in about 6:20 and set up my tent and inflated the air mattress, then went in search of water. Still in pain even without the pack on. Started dinner rehydrating, switched to dry clothes, drank over a liter of water before I felt caught up. Filtered water in the bladder and bottles for tomorrow and calling it an early night. Hope I can sleep. Tomorrow Side will be traveling up and waiting at the end of the day. Hope I can hike to him.","White House Landing

Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548693,"HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEKKI !!!!My tent site was slightly downhill so kept sliding down in the tent. When I climbed out in the morning, I could barely walk. The pain was so intense. Limped to the privy. Gathered up camp as quickly as I could. Started a hefty ibuprofen regimen. Started ahead of Garnet since there was no doubt I would be slow today. First thing I had to cross a stream on 3 thin logs. Great. I could barely walk. Morning dip anyone? I started hiking slow trying to adopt an even gait through the pain. And just kept going. Not much choice. Trail was pretty flat but it was the normal Maine trail. So hard to maneuver along. The second batch of 4 ibuprofen took the edge off a little more and I just kept going. Garnet stuck closer to me today. I was lucky to have her. Stepped with both feet into a mud mire. The muck went to the top of one boot and over the top of the other. Garnet had pointed it out but I didn't think it was as extensive as it was. My feet made sucking sounds as I pulled them out. What a smelly disgusting mess. At least I didn't fall down in it. Just what I needed. Boots that weighed 3 times as much as they should. Later stopped at a pond to clean up my legs and switch to clean socks. And a few miles later I took another partial step into muck. Just one of those not so good days on the trail.  Stopped to filter water at Hurd Brook Lean-to. Didn't want to take the time but didn't want to run out like yesterday. By mid-afternoon the ibuprofen wasn't much helping. As we approached Abol Bridge I was so relieved to be exiting the 100-mile wilderness. Garnet Turtle said I think I see someone looking for you. Side was crossing the bridge to meet me. Now there's a dream come true. I had been envisioning that for days. Dropped Garnet off at the hostel where she was staying, came back to our hotel and showered and put on clean clothes. Went back to pick her up for dinner. Side had a nice place in mind.","Rainbow Stream Lean-to

Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548786,"Happy Birthday Garnet Turtle !!Rain and possible thunderstorms for today so even though Garnet wanted to summit on her birthday, it just wasn't a good day. Picked her up for breakfast at the AT Cafe. Then went to Rite Aid to get some remedies for my back. Put on an icy hot patch. Stopped at the Baxter Park Headquarters to get more info about gaining access to Baxter Park to hike Katahdin. Not looking like I'll be able to do that. Thought tomorrow I'd try slackpacking the 10 miles before Katahdin but that may not be in the cards either. Terribly disappointing. I had wanted to summit on Friday which is supposed to be a really nice weather day. Taking Garnet Turtle out tonight to celebrate her birthday. Went to the hostel to pick her up and The Crow was there. He is headed to the summit tomorrow. Went just down the street from her hostel and had a really good meal. Garnet has decided to summit tomorrow also. The patch hasn't helped at all. We are headed home and I'll be driving back to Maine yet again as soon as I can safely hike. I couldn't wait to be done and head out of Maine but this is not how I imagined it. Big sigh.","Abol Bridge

Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548972,Trip home was 8 hours. Luckily I had no pain sitting in the car. But I moved at a snail's pace when we stopped at a service plaza and I had to actually walk. Let's hope this goes away and I can get back to Maine to finish. Hearing reports of other hikers I know successfully climbing Katahdin today. Garnet was one of them. So happy for them all.,"Baxter Park Inn

Miles From Nowhere,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548973,So good to be back sleeping in my own bed. I was able to get a chiropractor to squeeze me into his schedule late today so hopefully the adjustment will give me some relief over the weekend. I will see him again on Monday. I so want to finish the trail this year and put the state of Maine behind me for good.,"Home
