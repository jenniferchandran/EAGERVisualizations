Spirit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519490,"I am coming back on this year to hike with Sookie from Minnesota, who is coming back to try for her thru-hike again. I will meet her at mile 309 and hike until I want to come home or finish a second thru-hike, whichever. Looking forward to hiking with Sookie again and possibly Papa Al and Philco on up the trail. Also looking forward to meeting all the new hikers and making new friends.","
