Cleanshave,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553185,"For whatever reason I have decided to hike the Appalachian Trail again in 2017. No rhyme or reason, I just figure it would be nice to get out there and drop some of this winter weight I have been packing on by living the easy life indoors. Besides, some of my fondest memories are of my time hiking the AT.But Pre Hike Planning?Nope.Personally I don't think planning is required to hike the Appalachian Trail. Unless you enjoy that sort of thing I guess, or maybe if it is your first hike and you want to make sure you hit some specific things along the trail. But I have done over 3,000 miles on the AT, including a 2011 NOBO thru hike, so as long as I have the money and the time I know that the rest of it will work itself out.That being said though, I do have a plan for getting to the trail, and I'm planning on starting at Amicalola Falls this year, something I have never done before. I'm also hoping to hit the town of Helen, GA, something I have missed before but have been told it is a must see place to visit. (And hopefully Asheville, NC)As far as a starting date... I'd like to leave right now, but mid-January seems a little too early, and I made the mistake of hitting the PCT too early last year, so I think I'll wait a little bit. Besides I have plenty of things to do here in New England to make sure I have enough money put away to hike for a few months.I look forward to meeting this years thru hiking and section hiking hopefull's and I wish everyone the best of luck!",,View Entry,"Jan 11, Wed",0
Cleanshave,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553241,"Though I could probably list all the gear in my backpack off the top of my head I thought I'd save a full gear description for another time. For now I thought I would talk a little about my pack, a brand and design which I doubt anyone else will be carrying.My backpack is an REI Lookout 40, which was discontinued for a while but now appears to be back on the market with a few upgrades as well as a new look.I have been carrying this pack for over two years, and living out of it for almost as long. Originally what drew me to this pack was the panel loading design over the more common top loaders and the lack of safety reflectors or bright colors. Also at 40 liters it was an upgrade from the 30 liter pack I had carried on numerous month long hikes before owning this one. Plus it is still small enough that I can squeeze it on an airplane as carry-on if the need arises.Though 40 liters is a bit small for most thru hikers, it is after all considered a daypack by REI, it weighs over two and a half pounds, which is a huge drawback for most hikers looking to shed a few pounds from their base weight. But, it has lasted a lot longer than some of the ultra lightweight packs that I see other people using, many of which survive for only a single thru hike.Basically I trust this pack, and that counts for a lot with me.",,Appalachian Trail 2017 - Backpack,"Jan 13, Fri",0
Cleanshave,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553372,"Though it has been less than a week since I first decided to hike the Appalachian Trail I am finding it hard to think of anything else. Nothing else is getting done, and even when I sleep I am dreaming about being on the trail again.I'm excited, not only at the prospect of being out there again, but for all the other hikers attempting their first section or thru hikes on a major long distance trail.I'm done with indoor life. Not that I don't still sleep outside in my sleeping bag each and every night despite the well below freezing temperatures here in Rhode Island, but I'm getting too fat, too lazy.I need to hike.And so, despite saying that I wasn't going to do any planning, that the Appalachian Trail isn't a trail that requires an extensive thought-out plan, I am finding that I want to look more and more into the details of the hike. Because I want to be there already.Planning for me isn't so much planning, mapping out mileage and estimating time of arrival for mail drops, it is a way to fantasize about being out there on the trail again. I'm daydreaming through my daily life instead of working on what needs to be finished here before I can go out and hike.Like everyone else I am counting down the days until I am on the trail.",,Dreaming of Hiking,"Jan 16, Mon",0
Cleanshave,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554038,"Only three weeks since I decided to hike the Appalachian Trail, and only four more weeks before I'm actually on trail.The excitement I'm feeling is making hard to get anything else done.Just when I have my travel itinerary figured out and tickets to Atlanta purchased I get hit with an unexpected expense that kills a little more than 10% of my hiking budget.Ugh.These things happen though, that's why we save more than we think we'll need.Still...So I pack and repack my gear. Twice now shakedown hikes have been cancelled due to other responsibilities, and my gym membership; don't even get me started on that. I haven't been since before Thanksgiving, promising myself that I'd put in a few hours every couple of days until I left town.Realizing that I'd been lieing to myself the whole time I finally cancelled that monthly fee.The thought of having to climb the stairs at Amicalola Falls with muscles hard as jelly dounuts makes me cringe, but I'm looking forward to the Kickoff.The ATKO 2017 on Friday March 3 - Sunday March 5 at Amicalola Falls State Park.Until then I wait. Like everyone else I'm sure, eager to be on the trail and done with this last minute stuff.",,"Two Steps Forward, One Step Back","Feb 01, Wed",0
