Said it would be 6-10 days and it has only been two. While it still has a few miles to go, I'm confident it will be sitting there waiting for me when I show up next week.Should finalize the trip itinerary soon. Lots of folks who wanted to go with me--but couldn't spare the time--will be able to track my road route and my hike route and live vicariously through my descriptions of all the sights I see, both on and off the trail.",,Home,"Aug 25, Thu",0
Ring Splint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547333,"Tomorrow is the day! Crimony, it has been a long time coming. I've spent a multitude of hours researching and planning...and changing my mind. I've joked that the initial draft of my still very lengthy itinerary had me entering New Jersey at the start of Week Three of a 3.5 week trip. Picking the perfect 60 AT miles--from among the 2190 available--has been a challenge. Also had to scale back some of the sightseeing stops in favor of making it home within a reasonable timeframe, or at least a reasonable timeframe for someone who is still gainfully employed. Nevertheless, I believe the trip will be both memorable and one-of-a-kind.Anyway, I've accounted for all I can account for while still sitting in my apartment. Have to finish the last of the packing tonight after dinner and try to get some sleep. Ha! That's a laugh.Working part day on Wednesday, but will be in Maine by midnight. Wow! That's when the adventure begins.",,Home,"Aug 30, Tue",0
Ring Splint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547453,"Managed to zip the suitcase this morning. Now I just have to lug it down two flights of stairs for the ride to the airport. 
Checked and rechecked my checklist...shared my 46-page itinerary (yes, 46 pages) with friends and coworkers...figured out how to post a photo in my journal...
Counting down the hours. Just a couple more to go before this crazy odyssey takes flight.",,"Portland, ME","Aug 31, Wed",0
Ring Splint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548358,"By way of explanation for anyone wondering, I am hiking 60 miles on the Appalachian Trail (AT) to commemorate my 60th birthday. For whatever reason, that's the kind of thing I do. I visited all 50 states to commemorate my 50th birthday.Though I grew up in the foothills of the Appalachians, I never really heard about the trail until a few years ago, but it was the journey last year of an acquaintance affectionately known as the ""Knot Nazi"" that inspired me to hike a portion of the AT. Unfortunately, she just miss out on being able to call herself a thru hiker (someone who completes the whole trail in a year) due to some out-of-the-blue physical setbacks that sidelined her a little too long. But, as fate would have it, as I begin my version of hiking the AT (a little hiking mixed with a little sightseeing and sleeping indoors every night), she is back on the trail attempting to finish her remaining miles. I am genuinely in awe of her perseverance.In trail vernacular, I'm what's known as a ""Yellow Blazer,"" a class of hiker reportedly reviled and despised by the folks who walk the full distance of the AT from Georgia to Maine or vice versa. Rather than following the white trail blazes 2,190 miles through 14 states, Yellow Blazers are said to cheat by skipping parts of the trail and driving from one point to another. Hence the name; the yellow blazes are the road stripes. Hikers who do it are attempting to bypass difficult sections of the trail. However, since I'm not a real hiker and I've purposefully picked to walk 60 miles that represent a variety of terrains, maybe that only makes me a Pseudo Yellow Blazer. In either case, as I wing my way north tonight I'm finally calm for the first time in months. All the hours I've spent researching and planning, all the hours I've spent second guessing my decision to do this--and there have been many--are behind me now.I'd thought all along the adventure would begin when I reached the first trailhead or maybe when I arrived in Maine and headed north, but it actually started before that. As we often do in life, I stood at a crossroads and chose a path. Ironically, this one occurred in the Dothan airport of all places, but when I boarded the plane and the door closed behind me, this adventure began. Right or wrong, foolhardy or not, there is no turning back.","Home

Ring Splint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547882,"Not technically on the trail yet, but it could legitimately be said that I'm on the approach trail. After arriving in Maine in the wee hours of the morning, I was back at the airport a few hours later to pick up my transportation for this odyssey. No joke, $1,000+ for a one-way car rental and a request for a roomy trunk garnered me an offer for a no-cost upgrade to a minivan. Get it? Odyssey? Minivan? OK, moving on.When I told the gal I was leery of driving a minivan on curvy mountain roads, and that I needed a trunk where I could stow my gear out of sight, she handed me the keys--actually the key fob--to Black Beauty...300 horses ready to ride and raring to go. Black Beauty is a stealthy, low-slung Chrysler 300 that projects a confident air of sophistication laced with just a hint of intimidation.My initial thought upon seeing her was that she looked like a stalking bear, but considering my preternatural anxiety over facing off with a bear while hiking on the AT, I certainly didn't intend to ascribe the animalistic characteristics of a bear to the vehicle I'll be riding around in for the next 26 days. That would be way too Freudian for words. Instead, I've name her after the title horse in a favorite book from my childhood. Admittedly, that horse was male, but in these strange days where we are beset by gender confusion at every turn, I doubt anybody would dare call me on it.Let me set the stage for what happened next: black-on-black car and an even darker parking garage...I eventually gave up on opening the trunk and just threw my bags into the backseat. Figured I'd stop in the first patch of sunlight I came across so I could actually see the buttons on the fob and the dash. What a hoot it was for the rest of the day. Every time I'd stop somewhere on the drive north, I'd learn something else about the car. Having driven late 90's technology for the past 19 years, there have apparently been some substantial changes. And speaking of the drive north, if I had it to do again, I'd skip the pilgrimage to LL Bean's flagship store in Freeport and fly further inland than Portland. It was a beautiful sunny day, but crimony, there is even less to look at on Maine's interstates than we have in Alabama. Trees, trees and look, more trees.The Chicken Room at the Ice Fish Inn in Millinocket is aptly named; fluffy stuffed animals, a chicken-themed quilt, wall art featuring chickens...but it was cute and cozy. Less cute was the fact that my box of gear that made it all the way to Maine two days after I shipped it still hadn't made it to the hotel a full seven days later. But one quick phone call to the local post office and a crisis was averted...with eight minutes to spare. Meaning I'll have boots to hike in tomorrow if I can get a trailhead parking space.This evening after dining on the best lobster bisque I've ever tasted, I walked down to the lake to snap a few pics of Mt. Katahdin--the intended site of my first hike. A chance meeting with an artist who had detoured on a whim to spend the afternoon sketching the mountain brought me my first bit of Trail Magic. Trail Magic is a phenomenon on the AT where people leave snacks, water and other items along the route as gifts for the hikers. After learning of my plan to hike a portion of the trail in all 14 states, Jo Eaton asked me to wait and then gifted me with a watercolor of Mt. Katahdin she painted while I watched. Quite frankly, for many reason, our meeting felt somehow preordained, and the gift of Katahdin--the dark blue mountain--given to a stranger whose name, Nila, happens to mean dark blue mountain, seemed a magical coincidence to us both.","Portland, ME

Ring Splint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548371,"The day dawned overcast and I elected to sleep in until Baxter State Park HQ opened. Due to limited parking availabe at the trailhead where I'd picked to start my first hike, every space for Saturday--my intended hike day--had already been reserved by the time the window opened for out-of-staters to claim a spot. Just one of the many drawbacks of arriving on a holiday weekend. Rather than use today to chill and get oriented and organized, I'd decided to hike if I could get a parking permit. Otherwise, I'd have to drive to Baxter super early tomorrow and take my chances that someone with a reservation wouldn't show up. (Good thing I did based on the number of cars coming into the the park as I was leaving. I'd have been forced to hike an alternate section somewhere other than Katahdin, for sure, if I'd waited 'til tomorrow.)Took me about an hour to drive from Millinocket to the Katahdin Stream Campground. It's not really that far, but with half the distance being posted 20 MPH on a curvy dirt road and the other half posted at 40 MPH on a paved surface that often felt like a rutted wagon trail there wasn't much chance of shaving any time off the trip. To give you an idea how road hazard signage is handled in a wilderness area, there was one handmade plywood sign that read ""Dip"" and one that read ""Rock."" Both had arrows pointing downward and someone had spray painted a big circle around the respective hazard on the road. Likely, much appreciated by both bikers and cyclists.Once at the trailhead, I signed in, strapped on my backpack, grabbed my trek poles--took a deep breath--and headed into the woods...well, further into the woods. It wasn't taxing along the stream, but then came the rocky incline leading up to the falls. Fitbit says I only did 32 floor, but at the time it felt like much more. Learned a few things, e.g., hiking in shorts or leggings of some kind would be easier. My stylish pockets-down-the-legs pants kept hanging up on my kneecaps. Then there was the backpack. Here's a tip, if you've never hiked with a backpack, starting in a place like Katahdin is a bad idea. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I fell on my first hike. Hadn't even made it to the top yet.Wearing a backpack changed my center of gravity so dramatically I was off balance the whole day. Fortunately, I only torqued my left knee a little and scraped my right forearm on a tree trying to catch myself. I simply leaned back too far stepping down over a tree root--as anyone top-heavy has learned to do--and the pack pulled me backwards to the ground. As falls go, it was nothing really. Getting back up was the hard part. I felt like an upside down turtle. Now the first near-fall, that was the one that scared me. I have little doubt it would have ended with EMTs being called for a mountain evacuation. I danced on the top edge of a boulder pile for several long seconds until my Guardian Angel flicked a finger and shifted the weight in the pack. I still cringe just thinking about it. That one, plus the actual fall made me super wary. To reach the top of the falls I had to walk up a sharply angled granite face. I opted to ditch the pack at the base. Luckily no one came up the trail behind me.I'd like to tell you the trip down was easier...but it wasn't. I had to be super vigilant with foot placement whether going up or down, and I always wanted to watch to make sure that ""tree root"" didn't wiggle before I stepped on it. To get my full quota of miles, I had to walk south of the campground to Grassy Pond--a much more level hike, but not without its challenges...overgrown vegetation, for example. Particularly unnerving, having just answered the age old question, ""Does a bear poop in the woods?"" No, I didn't see a bear, but I did see bear scat. It was next to the creek about 50 feet from the trailhead. For all I know, the bear was behind me doing its business as I was signing in on the hiker roster and proudly snapping a pic of my signature.Count - 1 down; 13 to go.","Millinocket, ME

Ring Splint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548525,"Woke up to a cool, sunny morning and felt surprisingly good considering how whipped I'd felt when I went to bed...at 8:00 PM. Think the last time I went to bed that early I had the flu. Strolled down the street to breakfast at a local hiker landmark, The Appalchian Trail Cafe. It was packed with hikers and a few regular townsfolk. While the homemade English muffin made the breakast sandwich a tastier Mom and Pop equivalent of an Egg McMuffin, the big draw for visiting the place was to see the multitude of thru hiker names scribbled on the walls, ceiling tiles, and even the support beams. It was clear evidence of a sizable subculture that, until recently, I'd been completely unaware. Who are these people and why did they feel compelled to leave home, job, family to willingly endure the certain hardships of walking 2,190 miles? That's not a rhetorical question; I'd really like to understand it. But based on my one data point of 5.03 miles, I haven't yet been bitten by the AT Thru Hiker Bug. Other bugs, yes, but not that one.What do people everywhere do on Satuday? They go yardsaling! And I did the same as I left Millinocket behind and headed south through the Maine countryside into New Hampshire. Aside from trees, there are two thing plentiful in Maine. You're probably thinking moose and bears. Sure, though I haven't seen any, there's rumored to be a lot of both--moose even have their own roadsign due to their propensity for stepping out into traffic. No, I'm referring to ice cream stands and mail boxes suspended on chains. Don't know about you, but ice cream isn't what comes readily to my mind when someone mentions Maine--lobster, absolutely, and to that end even McDonald's offers a Lobster Roll on their menu now. As for the hanging mailboxes, turns out it is for practical, rather than (quirky) aesthetic reasons--Mainers like getting their mail at the end of their own driveway. The Post Office won't deliver if they can't easily reach the mailbox, but during snow season, the snow plows have been known to ""transport"" mailboxes down the road and into neighboring towns. The clever Mainers suspend their mailboxes from chains so they swing out of the way when struck by the edge of the plows.Lulled into a false sense of security by the beautiful weather, I drove further than originally planned and landed smack in the middle of a resort area on a holiday weekend. Can you say, ""no vacancy""? Finally found a place that was last updated in the 70s, but it was clean, had a pleasant view of a stream out the back, and the restaurant had an honest to gosh chef--a very good one. Part of the plan for this trip was the lack of planning. I booked hotels in Portland and Millinocket, but wanted to ""discover"" places along the way that'd otherwise never find. With night quickly falling, however, and me reviewing the logistics of sleeping in the car, I was reminded of the night on the Big Island of Hawaii when I arrived at my intended destination only to find a film crew occupying every room in town. A guy at the front desk gave me a phone number for a sort of local B&B network. Problem was, the person who answered only spoke German. So there I was on a pay phone at night in a convenience store parking lot--did I mention it had started to rain--trying to remember enough German to book a room for the night. Fortunately, it worked out OK in the end, but I made sure I had a reservation for the next town, the next night. Just so you know, I'm at the Hanover Marriott tomorrow night. I'm not taking anymore chances on ""discovering"" a place until everybody has gone back home next Tuesday.No hiking miles today, but I did pick up a sweet deal on a crystal bowl at a yardsale in a mini-warehouse complex outside Dover Foxcroft, ME. Had been owned by a teacher who liked to travel and never married. Still had the sticker from Nachtman's on it. That's not an inside joke for anyone who has ever been stationed in Gemany. It really did come from Nachtman's.","Millinocket, ME

Ring Splint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549975,"Today...hmmm. To sum it up, there were unique adventures, gorgeous weather and amazing scenery, but practically every choice I made seemed somehow beset with miscalculations and missteps. Nothing major, really--certainly nothing catastrophic--but at the end of the day there were just enough of them to make me say, ""I'd do that differently next time.""Headed up to board the Cog Railroad to the summit of Mt. Washington right after a breakfast that was as delicious as last night's dinner. Though the creaking floors and the 70s décor of the inn's freestanding addition reminded me of time I've spent in ""manufactured homes"", let me just say again, they hit the jackpot when they hired their chef.Now to the Cog and the first misstep. Designated a national landmark since 1976 and in operation for over 148 years, the Cog Railroad is a technological marvel no doubt worthy of its many accolades, but it was not my favorite way to travel. I'm not what you'd call a railroad aficionado--I can take them or leave them--so some of the significance of the experience was probably lost on me. Please understand, I don't regret doing it. The views near the top were magnificent; seeing the variety of construction remnants and other debris scattered on the ground beside the tracks was both interesting, and oft times, puzzling; the brakemen tasked with saving us all in the event the ""cog"" lost a tooth sending us careening down the mountain backwards were conscientious AND entertaining. I simply think, for my purposes, I'd have saved money and been better served by driving Black Beauty to the top of Mt. Washington via the Auto Road that came up the other side of the mountain. I wouldn't have been limited to spending only a hour at the top, could have hiked further and I'd have had ready access to some of my much-needed gear. Then again, I'd elected to do the Cog because any road that offers a bumper sticker that reads, ""This car climbed Mt. Washington"" gives the impression there may be some terrifying moments involving hairpin turns, steep drop-offs and white knuckles. Which frankly made the remote possibility of careening down the mountain backwards seem more desirable.Did you catch the mention of ""much-needed gear"" in that last paragraph? There were two gear-related missteps today. First, during my many months of research I overlooked the fact that the summit trail on Mt. Washington is nothing more than a boulder field--i.e., I should have taken my trek poles with me. Instead, I picked my way down (and up) a steep--nay, treacherous--incline of uneven and wobbly surfaces with my purse slung over one shoulder and clutching a long sleeve shirt and down vest under the other arm. Not ideal aids for balance, trust me. I made it work, but I'm pretty sure I deserve a bumper sticker.The vest and extra shirt weren't needed, in case you are wondering. Mt. Washington is known for its wildly unpredictable weather, and guides are quick to point out that you should be prepared for anything. Temps can drop as low as -47 degrees, and for the last 82 years the place has held a world record for the highest land-based wind speed ever recorded (231 MPH). The day of my visit, fortunately, the sky was clear, the breeze gentle and the temp in the low 80s; in short, just beautiful. Which leads me to the other gear-related miscalculation. Did you know certain blood pressure medications can make you sun sensitive and that even a mere hour without sunscreen at such a high altitude (almost 6,300 feet above sea level) on a sunny day can cook you faster than a Walmart rotisserie chicken? I do...now. For the remainder of the day, I explored in and around Franconia Notch, a picturesque stretch of interstate running south through the White Mountains that has been designated as a state park. Along the way I toured a small country cottage of poet, Robert Frost--one of many he owned--and the Flume Gorge, a remarkable natural display of water's power to erode solid rock.It was after leaving Flume Gorge that my next noteworthy miscalculation occurred. I did not realize freeway exits in the U.S. use one of TWO numbering formats: distance-based and sequential. My only experience up to now has apparently been with the former, so when I did a quick calculation in my head for continuing south along the interstate and then cutting across state to my next overnight destination, it turned out the desired exit was much, m-u-c-h further away than I'd thought. My intention had been to arrive in Hanover mid-afternoon and hike a little more of my NH mileage. Instead, I spent the afternoon and early evening navigating a tangled network of back roads hoping to reach my hotel before pitch back dark. Saw some sites I wouldn't have seen otherwise and passed a few farms and barns that would make the list of any coffee table book on the subject, but crimony was I tired by the time I finally got to the Marriott.I just wanted to get a shower and unwind from the long drive, but for some still unexplained reason, not one, but three sets of door cards I was issued by the front desk failed to open my door. In fact, after trudging back down to the desk three times with luggage in tow, the clerk finally came up with me and opened the door with a master key. So, effectively as I write this, I'm locked in for the night. Good thing I don't need to fill my ice bucket.","Bethlehem, NH

Ring Splint,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549601,"Just to let everyone know, I am off the trail and safely back home, as of around 9:30 PM on Saturday, September 24. I hiked my final 2+ miles on the AT earlier that day and decided it was time to sleep in my own bed. Yesterday and today, aside from sleeping late and napping on the couch, I've done a lot of laundry, relinquished Black Beauty back to the car rental place, picked up and processed a month's worth of mail and gotten myself back into the frame of mind to return to work tomorrow morning.I have more pics to post and many, many more journal entries to add...which should be considerably easier to do now that I have access to a reliable computer again. Though I've spoiled the ending--I survived the trip--give me a couple of days and then check back to read about the remainder of my on-trail and off-trail adventures.Thank you to all who prayed for me and wished me well.
