The last time I started a thru-hike on the AT, it did not start or end the way I had hoped. My trip will probably be a little different than some others. In March I will be taking a break from hiking to return home to help out with a charity fundraiser. In May I will be taking another break to visit Oklahoma to see one of my nephews graduate college.

It was about 5 miles. It was a good way to try and get readjusted to hiking. I haven't hiked recently and exercising only does so much in preparing for a hike. It was a nice hike. Started out with light snow flurries and had a tour of the Inn later that day. Three other groups here, a married couple, two sisters and a group of friends. Tuesday February 9, 2016It snowed last night and the temperature is 20 degrees just prior to my leaving. Before I left everyone had breakfast and the group of friends, all ladies, led a cheer for me and wished me luck. It was a pleasant surprise. Thank you ladies. I hiked the rest of the way to Springer Mountain, 4.4 miles on a trail covered in snow.

The snow continued to fall off and on during the day. Had a quick lunch at Stover Creek Shelter and decided to go for Hawk Mountain Shelter. The last half of the day didn't feel nearly as good as the first half. Another hiker, Dave (trail name- Sorrow) joined me along the way. Upon making it to Hawk Mountain Shelter, I quickly set up my sleeping bag and gear. Grabbed a quick bite to eat and got ready for bed. Also met Jen at the shelter. She is a recent graduate school student who will soon be a Chemistry Instructor at University of Tennessee-Martinsville(?). Also at the shelter is Kevin, trail name Dream On. He is from Chicago.

Sassafras Mountain kicked my tail. But then again so did every other section I hiked today. It was cold and windy as Dave and I hiked. A fellow hiker, trail name Big Cat passed us after a brief chat. He met the ladies from The Hike Inn that gave me a going away cheer and they told him I was on the trail also.After struggling into Gooch Mountain Shelter, I set my gear in the shelter. Dave (Sorrow) worked on a fire as Kevin (Dream On) arrived. As we were finishing our dinner Dream On said ""It must be getting close to zero degrees."" I don't have a thermometer but he is from Chicago, so I would think he knows a thing or two about cold weather. Later on, after the sun goes down, I hear him say, ""#@!%! it's cold."" That should give you an idea how cold it's been the past few days. It snowed briefly later on in the night but then the stars came out.

Leaving the shelter, everything had a coating of ice on it. The temperature seemed to be a little warmer compared to first thing this morning. The trail was covered with ice most of the day. Later in the morning, the wind picks up and starts knocking chunks of ice all over the place. Some of the ice was small but others were large baseball sized chunks. I did get nailed by several pieces as the day wore on. Thankfully, they were glancing blows and not the largest pieces, nor the smallest. As I made it to Blue Mountain Shelter, I was getting soaked. I wore my crampons to maintain my footing on the icy trail. The weather deteriorated while eating at Blue Mountain Shelter. Brent, another hiker, and I decided to go into Hiawassee after reaching Unicoi Gap. We got a shuttle to Budget Inn and then we had a full meal at Daniels.

Today wasn't any different. Made it to Deep Gap Shelter where I relaxed for a little while, read my Bible some and did some thinking.

I began to tire around the Georgia-North Carolina border, where I stopped to get a picture or two. First state completed. Made it to Bly Gap where I had a quick snack and a few pictures of an old twisted tree that is an unofficial landmark on the trail. I should have rested a little longer at Bly Gap but the wind was getting strong and the temperature was getting colder. Started up Courthouse Bald and knew I was in trouble. It was a steep climb and for a moment I was gasping for air so hard, it sounded as if I was climbing Mount Everest. Finally made it over the Courthouse and then into Muskrat Creek Shelter.

The first few miles weren't too bad. Knowing Albert Mountain was going to be a tough climb, I took a short break at Mooney Gap. As I started climbing Albert Mountain, I tried to pace myself. I have hiked this mountain before and knew the toughest portion was the very top. While going up Albert Mountain I was able to enjoy a few views of the surrounding area. After finally reaching the top, the winds picked up and the clouds were already moving in. Took a few pictures and headed out. My goal was to get to Rock Gap Shelter. I had a strong pace going down the mountain when I started to feel a hot spot under my left foot. I later stopped to give my feet a break. I am hoping no blisters are coming. Anyway after the break I continued on and made it to Rock Gap Shelter shortly before 2PM. Who-Dat already headed out to Franklin. Brent leaves shortly after I arrive.

For the first time this hike, I had to take off my rain jacket. Very humid also. Most of the views were blocked by trees or from being in the clouds. My left foot is still feeling a little sore. Made it to Winding Stair Gap where Mostly and I get shuttled into Franklin, NC. We meet Brent and WhoDat at Ron Haven's Budget Inn. I met Ron Haven also. He is well known in the area for being hiker friendly. After meeting him, I realize he is simply a nice and friendly man.
On another note, in a few days,I will be taking a little time off the AT to return home and prepare for a fundraiser. Some friends and I participate in the Benning to Gordon Relay. We run across Georgia, from Fort Benning to Fort Gordon to raise money for our military service members and veterans. This is our forth year doing this. Please check out Benning to Gordon Relay 4 on Facebook for more information and to keep track of our progress. The relay will start March 10.

During the shuttle, the wind was blowing very hard. The driver mentioned he had to slow down to control the vehicle. Wind gusts were reported to be about 58 mph in Franklin. I got dropped off at Winding Stair Gap and started hiking at 9:20AM. Made good time initially. The wind was blowing most of the time but the temperatures started out in the 50's. Made it to the Siler Bald Shelter trail a little after 11. About 40-50 minutes later, it began to rain and you could feel the temperature dropping. Prior to making it to the Wayah Bald Stone Tower, I was soaked. The rain was cold and the winds were strong and steady. The moment I stepped at the base of the Stone Tower, a heavy snow and sleet started coming down. I knew I only had a mile or so to go but I had to stop to put on an extra layer of clothes. It was cold. The sleet and snow would come and go. I get to Wayah Bald Shelter around 2:40PM. I meet Mostly again. He had a short day.

Well, we did a good job of setting it up but we all got a layer of snow on us as the wind blew snow through every crack and open space in the shelter. It was a long cold night. By morning all of our sleeping bags were damp from the snow. I got up several times during the night and knocked snow off of my sleeping bag.The three of us slowly get up and get moving. Rodney is the first one to hit the trail. I head out around 8:30AM. I feel okay the first few hours. The trail is covered in snow, 1-2 inches with some higher sections having a little more. Obviously, the footing is slippery at times. I make it to Cold Spring Shelter around 11:10AM. There are two guys taking a zero there and they are also caring for a dog that someone has lost. After a quick rest, I head back out. The winds are strong at times but I feel comfortable. I wanted to take a good break at Tellico Gap but the winds were so strong there I started getting cold quickly so I cut the break short after a snack. There are not a lot of views today because of the weather but there are a few. I make it to Wesser Bald Shelter where I take another break and have another snack. I considered staying here but decided to have a longer day. I leave the shelter around 2:45PM. Now I have hiked down Wesser Bald on several occasions and I knew it was a long hike. I had forgotten that is can also be uncomfortable, especially when you are still getting into condition. I finally make it down the mountain and decided to skip the A. Rufus Morgan Shelter and go for the NOC. I make it to the NOC around 5:45PM and I am tired. And my feet hurt. And I am hungry. And I see the River's End Restaurant. I go in and get something to eat and get a room at the hostel. I meet Brent and Dream On again. As I mentioned before, I am returning home for a charity run. I will be participating in the Benning to Gordon Relay. Check us out on Facebook. After the run, I will take a few days off to rest and then return back to the NOC and restart my hike to Mount Katahdin.

After having longer than expected time off for a charity run (we raised about $5,000) and after checking on how big the crowds were ( I spoke to a GSMNP employee and he said the AT was extremely crowded in the park), I have decided to do ""modified flip flop"". Okay, I made that term up. I am going to drive to Damascus and head north from there. After I finish hiking north (hopefully sometime this summer), I will return to Damascus and head back to the NOC (hopefully I will do that section in the fall).

The first thing I noticed when I start hiking in the woods was that I could tell it had been a few weeks since I hiked. There weren't a lot of views even though the trees are still bare of leaves. But the views that were available were nice. And there was a lot of sunshine. It got a little warm as the day went along. Overall, a nice day. There is detour on the AT due to a washed out bridge.

I pass several small streams, then finally reach a river that runs next to the AT as it rejoins the Virginia Creeper Trail for a short distance. I take a short break and have something to eat. There is a good crowd of people cycling and enjoying the Virginia Creeper Trail. After my break I continue on towards Lost Mountain Shelter. Arrive at the shelter at 12:45 PM. Kick back and relax.

Got up around 6:30AM and left the shelter at 7:45AM. Initially there was a light mist. That went away for an hour or two, then the rest of the day was either rain or heavy mist. Many times, visibility was about 100 feet. I felt good the first 3 hours, then I began to fade some but still make good time. I go by the Lewis Mountain Wayside area and decide to go for Big Meadows Lodge. By this time I am soaking wet and cold. The temperature is in the fifties and most of the time a steady wind. As I am hiking to Big Meadows, I realize I don't have the""required"" reservation or any cellphone coverage. I also need to resupply my food. As I am approaching Big Meadows I decide to go to the wayside first to resupply and then try and get a reservation. Unfortunately I take an early side trail. This ended making my trip a little longer. I make it to the wayside, got my supplies and called the Lodge for a reservation. I try to set up the reservation over the phone but they tell me to come onto the Lodge. I make it to the Lodge around 4:30PM. I am even more soaked and colder. I get a room and when I walk into the room, it is cold. Turn on the radiator heater and wait to warm up. Afterwards, I get cleaned up and go to the dining room. There I run into Who-Dat. We talk. I offer to let him sleep on the floor in my room instead of having to tent. He accepts. I have dinner, which was pricey, return to the room and Who-Dat and I prepare for tomorrow. Who-Dat was kind enough to take my gear and clothes with his to the laundry. Afterwards, we settle down for the night.","Hightop Hut

Overall a good day except for a few blisters developing. Had some nice views. I arrived at the Byrds Nest #3 Hut at 3:50PM. I grab a spot in the shelter. This is the fifth day hiking in the Shenandoah park. Everyone else seems to have seen a bear except for me. I've seen signs of bear activity: logs and roots turned over, bear tracks, bear scat on the side of the trail, bear scat piled high in the middle of the trail, but no bear. UNTIL THIS EVENING!!! A bear approached the shelter area this evening after dinner. Everyone at the shelter gets a view of the bear along with pictures and video. As it slowly left, I see another one with it.

The noise and shaking of bushes got stronger. I heard a grunting sound and saw a black blur in the bushes. Initially it looked like it was heading towards me but then it went at an angle. Soon an adult black bear comes darting across the trail about 15-20 in front of me. It happened so quickly that I didn't have time to get a picture.

They got a shuttle to Hughes Gap and are hiking north. I had a lot of climbing today but I feel pretty good.","Mountain Harbour B&B/Hostel- Roan Mtn, Tenn.

Set up my tent and did my evening chores. Later in the afternoon, I meet Winston. She is finishing her thru-hike soon. Also meet another hiker who is going north to Virginia.

About an hour into the hike I saw a bear cub by the trail. I immediately look around for the mother bear but didn't see on. I look back at the cub and it is looking at me. We just stared at each other for several moments. It was about 20 yards away from me. I finally decide to try and get its picture. As I reach for my camera the cub bolts back into the woods. I could tell by the noise it ran along the trail and then crossed the trail and ran down the steep mountain. The entire episode only lasted around 15-20 seconds but it was still exciting. I continued hiking to No Business Knob Shelter, a gain of about 100 feet, and take a break. I meet two day hikers and we talk for a little while. From there the trail gain about 700 feet then it descended 500 feet to Spivey Gap. I take another break and then begin a nearly 3000 foot ascent to Little Bald. I later arrived at Bald Mountain Shelter around 4:15PM. I had considered going further but decided to stay because there is a good water supply here.

Mostly level trail with a few roots and rocks. I felt pretty good during the morning but didn't seem to make good time even though there weren't any major ascents or descents after the first mile. I took a break near Chestnut Log Gap-Jerry Cabin Shelter. Shortly after I resumed hiking, I could tell that I didn't feel so good any more. I had no energy. And the trail was getting tougher. Big Firescalb Knob was very rocky and strenuous. I remembered this section from my 2009 section hike. I didn't like it then and I didn't like it today. But there were some nice views today so I guess things weren't so bad. Took another break near Jones Meadow-campsite. Later I meet two section hikers that were heading north and they said there was no water till the next shelter, Spring Mountain Shelter.

This shelter has a chain link fence on the front to keep bears out or to allow idiot hikers to feed the bears from the inside. Anyway, I set my stuff inside and prepare for the evening.

I think everyone was a little surprised by the noise the falling acorns made. I've noticed the size, amount and noise they have made over the past week or so but last night there seemed to be extra noise. Sounded like explosions when they hit the shelter or ground. I didn't sleep much last night. Part of it was anticipating the end of my thru-hike and part of it was having other things on my mind. I started hiking a little after 8AM. The weather was nice. I also felt relaxed and happy knowing what was going to occur in a few hours. It was also nice to know it was going to be almost all downhill. I hike to the Jump UP and enjoy the views. Clouds covering some of the valley floor and mountains peaks above the clouds. I resume hiking and after an hour or so I pass several hikers going northbound.

Later, I cross the bridge over the Nantahala River and immediately change from a thru-hiker on the AT to being one who has thru-hiked the AT. My mother and Aunt Martha meet me near the bridge.

Actually, I think I always have more to be thankful for than I realize but I know this year even more so. Even though there were times of pain, discomfort, frustration and aggravation, my hike on the Appalachian Trail was a wonderful experience. Thinking back on my hike, I am thankful for many things: all the natural beauty that I was able to experience, all the wonderful people I met, all the trail magic that brightened my days, the encouragement and support I felt along the way. There were a few moments where I wondered why I was doing this hike. But those moments were brief and quickly followed with the sense that no matter where I was, I was happy to be there. I knew that's where I was supposed to be. Someone criticized me for taking so long completing the hike. I erased the message. I can't understand why someone would want to rush to end such an enjoyable adventure. I knew I was going to take a long time. I was glad to complete the hike and said to leave it at the same time. I tell my friends that I hiked in all four seasons this year. Not many people get to say that.Folks have asked me if I had any other plans for long hikes. I initially told them I was probably not going to do any more 5-plus month long hikes due to financial and other reasons. I had initially planned to do month long hikes. But just a few days ago, I started thinking why not another long hike. We'll see.For anyone considering hiking the Appalachian Trail or any other trail, whether it be a thru-hike or section hike, I encourage you to do it. Get out and enjoy the sights, sounds and smells of nature. You'll be thankful you did.",,Thanksgiving,"Nov 24, Thu",0
