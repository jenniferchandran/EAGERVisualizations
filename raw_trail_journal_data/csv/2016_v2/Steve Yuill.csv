Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513770,Now that I finally have all the major pieces of gear its time to focus on some shakedowns and physical preparation. I was able to take a walk last night with 22lbs in my pack and with my brand new hiking boots on. Nothing better than getting the shoulders use to some weight and attempting to break in the boots.Everything went well. Looking forward to increasing distance and scheduling some weekend trips in before it gets too cold in Michigan!,,Training,"Sep 17, Thu",1
Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514012,"Saturday the 19th and Sunday the 20th I got my butt out there. Saturday was a planned, ok I better start getting in hiking shape, hike. So I piled in about 20lbs of gear into the pack and headed out on a route. Knowing the streets around me I had a route in mind but I wasn't certain on how far it would be. I started out feeling good, the pack felt good, the boots and socks seemed ok. All is well. Half way through I was still ok. Almost home and only 10% to go....wow 20lbs is alot heavier that it was when I started out! I know, I know, scientifically impossible. I took the pack off and I felt like I would hit the ceiling. Its a lot like getting off a long bike ride and trying to walk. Your legs seem to almost still want to peddle and not walk. You almost march away from your bike. All in all the trip was successful. Everything felt ok and I physically worked and felt it but not so much that it was painful.
Once home I jumped into my car and measured the route. It ended up being exactly 3 miles.",,View Entry,"Sep 19, Sat",3
Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514016,"Sunday the 20th I didn't have a plan in my mind at all. When about weekend tasks and fixing up the garage exterior etc. Then last minute my brain said ""you know what you need to get out there. I know you just ramped up some miles yesterday but back to back to back....days is what the AT will be so lets go!""So carrying the same setup of weight I headed out on the same route. I was a little sore in a few places but not necessarily muscular. Lower back was one spot but again this is all good training for fighting through it. My right boot was laced a bit tight and I was getting a ribbon of pain on the front left of my boot. I had to stop and loosen it up before it was comfortable and then I had no problem after that.I felt even better this trip but by the end I definitely felt the weight again. I tried to listen to my feet and understand if I was getting a hot spot or my feet were just tired. More so out of ensuring that I have the right boots/liner/sock for me.",,View Entry,"Sep 20, Sun",3
Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514258,"After a few days of contractors, doctor check-ups and other various life tasks I was finally able to get back out for another 3 mile loop around the neighborhood. My neighbors that RV camp often in the summer were outside and I told them of my AT thru hike plans. They are excited and had lots of questions. I can see several visits with them in my future to talk about this.So after that I got a bit of a late start on my distance. So I tried to set a semi-aggressive pace. I sub'd out most my gear and opted to carry mostly full water bottles. Weight came in at closer to 25lbs.My Osprey Exos 58 belt was an issue today for the first time. It seemed to keep slipping. I had to adjust probably 30 times over my 3 miles. Once I got back home I popped out to REI.com to read some user reviews and there were definitely a couple along those lines.  I'll give it a few more test hikes before I return. Other than that the hike was great and helped loosen up my hamstrings which seemed a bit tight the past 2 days.",,Miles...,"Sep 23, Wed",0
Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514994,"I was able to get a few things accomplished this week. I did head out for my 3 mile track with the pack on Tuesday 9/29. I was able to practice the setting up my Copper Spur UL1 in the case of setting up camp in rain. Its a simple case of setting up the footprint, poles and fly first then crawling inside and setting up the tent (that has a mesh roof). Keeps the interior of the tent from getting wet during the process. One thing I'd like to explore is putting my tent in a different stuff sack. The one that it came with large and I can creatively wrap up all the tent items in a more space efficient manner. We will see....In terms of training I'm trying to listen to my body and not go all crazy with it. I'm generally 0% or 100% and over the past few years have been trying to learn and not go 100% all the time. Especially with a long distance backpacking trip....cant just survive like that without forcing an injury.Tonight 10/1 I did the usual 3 mile track with 25 pounds. I felt good and the belt seemed better. The weather definitely snapped here in Michigan and I had to wear long pants, light jacket and took some head cover just in case. Once I was moving I was plenty warm. The other challenge is that its getting darker earlier and getting in these 3 mile conditioning runs in daylight is getting hard.",,Prep.,"Oct 01, Thu",0
Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515215,"Well its official the neighbors think I'm crazy. Stage one was...why is he marching around the block with a backpack. Stage two was today and it was why is he out there in the rain! That and I looked like a big yellow pacman with my poncho over me and my pack.The temperature was 45 degrees with gusting winds up to 20mph. Perfect weather to see if my poncho rain solution would work. So I headed out to get in my usual 3 mile track to test things out. After having read so much about poncho vs rain suit vs rain cover for your pack vs all in one....it was easy to see the negatives to my poncho solution. However, I think I'm going to stick with it. Even in the gusting wind keeping my arms inside and holding on a bit was ok. Wasn't too troublesome even with the shifting wind direction. I liked the openness of the bottom of the poncho so that I could get some air and not overheat too much. However I was pretty warm after 2 miles. I know there is no perfect rain solution but I liked the poncho over the pack as a solution. My pack was dry once I arrived home but with the driving wind I had gotten some water on me. No much but some. The culprit was the arm holes in the poncho and that lovely cold driving wind.",,Rain,"Oct 03, Sat",0
Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515649,"Got out on Monday and Wednesday for the usual 3 mile loop. Again being in my residential neighborhood not the best but better than not doing anything. My dog had to have surgery on Friday so I had some things to do on Thursday evening and Friday. Friday night (although not exciting) it was nice to stay home with him and make sure he was comfortable. Poor boy has been through a lot.Since I was home Friday night I decided to unpack the training weight and see how all my actual gear felt. Training weight has been around 25 pounds and my base pack weight at this point is 13! So that felt great hahaaa. Alright back to reality and time to repack the training weight. I have used gatorade bottles that I filled with water for weight. I pack clothes around them to do my best and have the weight close to my back and in the center. I removed a few of the bottles and with some of the added clothes the weight is closer to 22 pounds. I tried to include some things that may be useful instead of just all dead weight. Headlamp, poncho, first aid kit etc.I did complete a 3 mile loop on Saturday and a new 4.5 mile loop on Sunday. It was good to finally increase the mileage a bit to see how the body would react.",,Week of Oct 5,"Oct 12, Mon",0
Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516011,"Nothing too crazy this week but I did change it up a bit.
Got out for my usual 4.6mi loop on Tuesday evening. Felt ok but across the ball of my left foot started to have some pain/tightness. Most likely from me trying to push the pace since it was a bit later start.
So when Thursday came around my plan was to skip the training run which I managed to do. Really to no effect since I felt like I needed a day off of work so I used a vacation day for Friday. So I did the normal route Friday morning. Way to rest up that foot!
It was a perfect fall day on Friday and not only where the horses out at the local hunt club but I spotted a bald eagle which is rare where I live. Snapped a photo as quick as I could but he was pretty far out and zooming in you can just barely see the white head and the brown body. Cool experience none the less.
Once I got home Friday I setup the tent in the back yard with the intent of just getting familiar with some new gear. Additionally I knew that rain was in the forecast for Saturday so I wanted to leave it up and have a good waterproofing test. I did end up taking a nap out there for about two and a half hours. I do like the mummy bag and air mattress!
Skipped the training run on Saturday but did head out on Sunday. Again got lucky with the weather as well as with the wildlife. Spotted two white swans swimming and managed to take some pics. They were feeding so I got a couple of pics of their heads underwater and their white tail feathers in the air.",,Week of Oct 12th,"Oct 19, Mon",0

Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516861,"Forever the optimist.After getting out for the typical 4.6 route on Tuesday the 27th I wasn't a quarter of a mile in when I could feel my left foot issue creeping in. Maybe once I get warm and loosen it up it will feel better? Didn't happen  I did my best to adjust the straps on my pack to shift the weight a bit onto my right side. By the time I hit the four mile mark my foot wanted to let me know it was there every step of the way. So I tried to think....Mets baseball, World Series, oh the weather is nice, whats going on in the financial markets....anything other than focusing on the foot. This Jedi trick had limited success. Once home I tried to stretch it out, elevate, and throw some Icy Hot on it.I told myself ""We will see on Thursday how I feel"". Decided to take Thursday off since even at work in my work shoes I could feel the foot pain.Saturday...well I'll see how I feel later today. Skipped it.Sunday....skipped it.I seriously held out hope each and every day! I thought maybe today? No luck. As I have said previously I tend to be 0% or 100% no middle ground so for me this is a success to be wise enough to land somewhere in the middle.Daylight savings was this weekend which means any training runs will now be in 100% darkness.",,Week of Oct 26th,"Nov 04, Wed",0
Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517427,"Still nursing that foot pain. Since I do have some time I'm in rest and heal mode.I did my 4.6mi loop on Tuesday 11/9. I could tell the pain was still there but definitely had improved from my previous hike. Its hard to pinpoint the cause of the pain since I use 3 different shoes. Hiking boots, running sneakers and work shoes. My work shoes on that foot did look worn down so I purchased a new pair.Posted my upcoming thru-hike on Facebook. Work and family were already in the know but it felt good blasting it out to everyone. Week of 11/16Since I still have pain everyday just from normal walking I'm taking this month off from training. Just need this foot to get better and this is why I started early! Time to recover from a set back such as this. 
Week of 11/30
Well finally my left foot is better but then I tried to self-select inserts for my boots and did some damage to my right foot. I am making an appointment this week to go to a professional to have some better inserts for my boots. After walking around on Saturday with my plantar fasciitis inserts my right foot went crazy. Extreme pain, swollen and I could barely put weight on it. Stayed out from work on Monday to ice it down and rest it. Thankful that I did since it was definitely improved on Monday but still painful. Waking up on Tuesday morning and its greatly improved and I can now bend my toes (swelling down). I am shocked at the damage I did and the pain I had since I didn't do anything extreme with my feet just put my new inserts in both shoes and wore them on Saturday.
Thankful that I am learning these things now and still have time to get into the shape I'd like to be in for my hike.

Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518371,December:After the craziness of my foot pain I am not self-prescribing anymore lol. Off to a foot specialist to get measured and fitted for a solution to my feet. I didn't end up with a full custom orthopedic but something better than an off the shelf solution. The challenge is it is fit for my current hiking boots. While on the trial if I switch up to trail runners I'll be out of luck. I am just hoping that the foot shape is larger than anything else I might try out and then I can shave the insert down to the new footwear. However like a handful of other decisions this is one I'll wrestle with weekly until I start the trail (boots vs trail runners). If come to this realization before I depart I can always go back to the store and get something for the trail runners as well. It would also be nice to have the boot as a resupply when I get to the New Jersey/Penn. rocks and then return to trail runners after that section. We shall see....The bottom line verdict is that I have high arches in both feet. My left foot pain was plantar fasciitis and the right foot pain I triggered is gout. How old do I feel now? Good times. Anyway...happy to be learning this stuff now.I have some time off work later this month and plan on starting back up on the 3 to 4 times a week 4.6 mile hikes with full pack. I'll definitely ease into it and see how the feet take it.,,Month of December,"Dec 14, Mon",0
Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520513,"The shoe battle:Well I went to REI and ended up picking up a pair of Saloman XP Pro 3D trail runners. They are very comfortable! My boots are 43 oz. and the trail runners are ~25oz. That is a nice weight savings right there. My mind is made up and I'm starting with the trail runners. I made sure and purchased a pair that were not waterproof so that I have the extra breath-ability.I took my new footwear to get some custom inserts. A bit of support for my high arch. I'm lucky to have a Foot Solutions store close by to where I live.Other Purchases:I did pick up a luxury item this month! I don't own a kindle, I don't want to hike with my iPod and all the same old songs I have had on there forever but I did want something to mentally entertain me. So I ended up picking up a 3oz AM/FM radio. I don't plan to hike while listening to it but as a way for me to have fun searching for local channels at night or listening to some news. I'm a believer in the mental aspect of this adventure and having something to help with that will be worth the weight (and AAA batteries).Training:In addition to the gear additions, I have been starting to get into shape after taking some time off for my foot to heal. When it has been cold outside I still strap on the pack and hoof it up and down some stairs at home. During one of the surprisingly warm days recently I was able to get out and do a 3 mile walk around the neighborhood. I know these things aren't the perfect readiness training but I'm more looking to keep the muscles working and get use to the new footwear etc. As spring comes I'll be able to do some actual hikes.",,Month of January,"Feb 01, Mon",0
Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522171,"Training training training. Been lucky in Michigan with the weather and the occasional 40-50 degree day during the winter. That allows me to get outside with the pack and walk some miles. Otherwise when its blistering cold out I'm stuck trudging up and down stairs in the house. Since I'm starting at Amicalola State Park and doing the approach trail I know on the first day within the first mile the AT guide says ""604 steps to the top of the falls"". I won't even have eaten any weight out of my pack yet! So hopefully the stairs I'm doing now in my house will pay off.Even though I bought trailrunners and custom inserts my left foot is still giving me some trouble. Confident that it's just that I need more support in that shoe but I made a Dr appointment just to be safe.",,Month of February,"Mar 01, Tue",0
Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525291,Two Podiatrist visits this month. Bottom line is no custom inserts for me but I have several strengthening and stretching exercises to help my left foot recover. I think that my hiking posture was poor and I put some extra stress on my left foot to cause this strain. I have one more visit with him on April 4th.In between these new exercises for my feet I have been doing a mix of staying off my feet and keeping in some sort of shape. I blasted my calves in one workout so much that the next day I didn't feel my foot pain because I was so sore in my calves lol. My goal is still to start in decent shape so that I can enjoy my first few weeks. In reading other hikers journals it seems many of them are having feet and knee issues. I'm hoping that my body will have already gone through some of this adjustment pain and I wont be battling the same old injuries (just new ones!).The big countdown of working days left has FLOWN by. I swear just last week there was 100 days to go and now I am down to my final week of work! April 1st will be my final day in the office and then my leave of absence begins. Work has been good at allowing me to take a sabbatical.I am going to post an overview of the AT as my next entry so those who are following me that are not familiar will get some background information. After that I'll wait until I begin my trip for further entries.   ,,Month of March,"Mar 29, Tue",0
Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525411,"Hello everyone I thought that I would throw up this overview especially for the non-hikers out there. I'm hoping this gives you some insight into the trip and answers some questions about it.The Appalachian Trail (AT) is 2,190 miles, runs through 14 states and includes 464,500 feet in elevation gain/loss. A typical hiking pace puts the duration to complete at 5 to 7 months. Thousands of hikers attempt a thru-hike each year and one in four is successful.I will be starting in Georgia on April 20th and making my way north to Maine. I will be camping in my tent, staying in shelters that are scattered along the route as well as occasionally staying in towns. The AT is nice in that it passes through a town about every 3 - 5 days. So really the trip is a whole bunch of ~4 day backpacking trips strung together! This gives me the opportunity to resupply my pack with food, sleep in a bed, do laundry and take a shower. It is also an ideal place to take a day off ('a zero' in hiker lingo) and rest.A lot of folks who partake in doing a serious long distance hike take a trail name to be totally immersed in a new life style. That life style is the one of a hiker, who has left everything behind and is beginning a once in a life time adventure. Typically a trail name is assigned to you based on something you do apart from everyone else you meet. For example, ""The Hiking Viking"" is out there this year and you guessed it, he looks very much like a Viking. ""Stretch"" hiked in 2015 and has written several articles that I enjoyed. Her routine included stretching in camp. A guy from 2014 was in a shelter with several hikers on his first night out. He snored so loud that people said it was like sleeping next to a dinosaur when someone offered up ""Snorlax"". He adopted that as his trail name for the remainder of his trip. So don't be surprised when being referred to as Steve, takes a vacation.Obviously I have to carry everything that I might need but not too much, knowing that there is a town where I can purchase things not too far off. Tent, sleeping bag, first aid kit, clothes, food, water and a few luxury items. It gets complicated quickly and the ounces turn to pounds very fast. I have added some of my gear under in the gear section on the left.I have also posted an extremely detailed list of gear and weights here for those that are interested: https://lighterpack.com/r/2uwaebAll this gear (~18.6 pounds) doesn't include the weight of food and water which will add another 8-10 pounds.My Dad will be assisting me in updating this journal during my trip and posting a cool map as well as some pictures. The map was something that a previous hiker, Airlock did and I enjoyed following her successful thru-hike last year. So thank you Airlock for the map idea and how-to instructions.Thank you all for showing interest in my trail journal. Feel free to sign the guest book and any words of encouragement during my trip will be a morale boost.",,Overview and welcome.,"Mar 30, Wed",0
Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528902,"I was able to leave Detroit one week early to travel to western Mass to visit my family. It was great to get home and spend time with Mom and Dad. This also allowed me to get in some training hikes on the hills of Berkshire County as opposed to the flat land hiking in the Detroit area.   On three separate hikes I covered about 18 miles. My foot felt surprisingly good! I trained every other day to give my body some recovery time. I hiked several of the popular western Mass spots including Monument Mountain, Great Barrington, MA.Travel day on Tuesday the 19th. Flew from Hartford to Atlanta, hopped on a train and then finally caught the shuttle to the Hiker Hostel where I will spend the night with 23 hopeful hikers. The hostel shuttle will leave Wednesday April 20th at 8:30am to take us to the trail head and I can begin day 1!

Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529161,"Woke up at the Hiker Hostel and took my last shower for a few days. The van dropped 9 of us off at Amicalola Falls State Park. I stuck with two guys I met at the train station, Tom who is from England and Klause who is also from Michigan. Tom is tall and has a big stride. He was flying! Klause and I stuck together for a bit. The weather was hot. I was training in 32 to 60 degree weather and today was 80 and sunny. I went thru water a lot faster than I thought I would. Before I knew it I was out. Around mile 7 there was a stream. I cameled up at the source and filled both my bottles up. Best feeling ever!I stopped at the Black Gap Shelter for lunch and it was obvious that I waited too long. The food and water gave me a nice boost.Another 1.5 miles and I was at the top of Springer Mnt, stopping there for a few pictures and a snack. No one was up there! Usually this a common place to sit and collect yourself. I sat here for 15 minutes and not a soul.I decided I felt good enough to not stop for the day. The Approach trail was 8.8 miles and took me 5 hours. So it was 2:40pm at this point. My first miles officially on the AT! Made it to Stover Creek Shelter, cooked some food and early to bed. Lots of people here some I know from Hiker Hostel last night. Popped up my tent to try and get a good sleep without someone next to me snoring etc. It’s an adjustment to sleep in a common area with many different folks.

Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529418,"After tenting at the Stover Creek Shelter and going to bed early I was awakened early by someone taking down their bear bag at 5 AM. The squeaking woke me up. Shortly after that two owls were having a conversation. So I just got up. It was still dark out and I needed my head lamp. I packed up and hit the trail.Another guy who camped near me did the same and left about 10 min before I did. It was so hot yesterday that I wanted to get an early start and put a few miles behind me before that noon heat came out. I felt ok and consciously ate more during the day. This helped maintain a better energy level and today it wasn't as hot. I kept a nice steady pace and walked alone. Today was all about rolling hills with one or two larger peaks. Around noon I passed the guy that left before me, his name is Dan.After lunch my legs were tired and I was looking forward to an early day. I ended up doing 11.6 miles and stopped at Justus Creek. There is a shelter 1.5 miles ahead but I’d rather be at this smaller campsite with less noise.Just as I arrived Dan showed up and he is staying the night here as well. We stopped early in the day (around 2:30) so we had our choice of spots. We pitched our tents and made dinner together. He is a nice guy out for a 2 week hike and going as far as he can. We chatted about all kinds of topics and passed the time. At 7 the rain came so we scrambled to our tents for the night.

Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529423,"It literally rained all night. Sometimes light and sometimes heavy rain that woke me up. My tent did its job and the inside was perfectly dry. It was still raining when I woke up at 6. So I had to think of creative ways to pack my backpack with minimal exposure to getting soaked outside. You have to move quickly to break down camp yet not leave anything behind in your haste. When I packed all I could inside my tent I stepped out to realize I slept in a puddle. My tent couldn’t have been muddier or wetter than it was.Once I was all packed I grabbed a pop tart and some blueberry craisons for breakfast to eat on the run. It was pouring out now and the craisons just had to go I couldn’t carry my poles, pop tarts and the baggie so I threw them all in my mouth at once before I left.My poncho I bought to replace a super thin one I had been using wasn’t great. I wish I packed my ugly yellow poncho it fit well around my pack this one doesn’t. So I struggled with that for a bit while I hiked.    The rain today was the same as overnight, calm sometimes and then a torrential downpour a few minutes later. While hiking I was warm but stop for a minute and it was cold. My plan was to hike 11 miles to Lance Creek campsite which is the last place you can camp for the next 8 miles without a bear canister. So many hikers had the same plan.I came out to Woody Gap and there was a main road to Suches GA. I took shelter under a small overhang just as Dan and two hikers came out of the woods. We all huddled there for a few and I decided to call it a day and go into town. My gear was already wet and setting it up again and using it didn’t seem appealing. Especially since it was raining like crazy.Dan decided to head to Lance Creek. The forecast was for rain all day and overnight as well. So I hitched with the two other hikers into Suches, GA. For $20 I got a bunk bed and a shower. They serve food there so that was nice to have pizza for lunch and a burger for dinner. Since the weather is bad lots of hikers kept rolling in. The forecast for the next few days is sunny and warm.

Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529537,"I left the Wolf Pen Lodge this morning at 7:40 because rumor had it that the shuttle back to the AT at Woody Gap would not leave until 9:30. I like to start early so I figured I would take my chances and hitch hike a ride or just walk it. Unfortunately with my luck I ended up walking it. It was 1.5 miles and I already had planned to hike 11. It took me 50 minutes and I was on the trail doing AT miles that count by 8:30.Soon enough the two hikers I hitched into the Lodge with yesterday caught me. They were both much faster than me. They did the same thing but managed to pick up a ride part way up. They said the shuttle wasn’t going to run until 10am so I am glad that I hiked back to the trail.Other than the extra miles, today was a good test because of Blood Mountain. Today’s hike had an elevation gain from 3000 ft. to 4500. It was hard but easier than I thought. After that climb the trail descends down to Mountain Crossings at Neel Gap. Mountain Crossing is a full outdoor outfitter right on the Appalachian Trail.   It also has a hostel where I will stay tonight. 18 dollars gets you a bunk bed and a shower. The well was low (despite yesterday’s rain) so the laundry was not available. I did my best to wash my shirt, socks etc. in the sink. Ahh the hiker life.I bought a frozen pizza and ate the entire thing for dinner. Don’t worry Mom I bought some fresh fruit as well.

That is, NO snoring, everyone up around the same time and no late night partiers. I slept in a little since I wanted to get some fresh fruit from the store as well as buy an emergency poncho as my rain solution. My Frogg Toggs poncho was horrible. After those chores were taken care of I headed out. I walked for about 2 miles and hit an awesome overlook. So I sat there and ate breakfast. The day had a few hills that were rough in addition to a lot of slight ups and downs. I did get some trail magic at Hog Pen Gap. I ran into Mike and Dan (can’t believe we all are trail nameless so far), we were at the trailhead chatting when a truck pulled up with three guys in it. They were in town biking and wanted to leave some food for the hikers.We showed them a good place to leave the goodies where hikers would see it. Then they brought out beer. So I grabbed a Miller Lite and some fig newtons and enjoyed the trail magic. Mike went zooming off, while Dan and I stuck together. Talking and hiking is good as it helps pass the miles. Dan stopped for food and water but I am able to snack and drink on the go. So I motored on. We met back up at our originally intended destination. I got water, ate a bit and decided to move on with Dan. It was too early to stop. We ended up doing another 4 miles. We grabbed extra water at a stream and hauled it to a camp site. It is awesome that we are the only two here. As Dan says ""I like company but not the crowds"". So we cooked up dinner and hung our bear bags. We are at 3400ft elevation and the wind makes it a bit cold here so as the sun set we dove into our respective tents (we have identical tents btw) and are off to sleep.

Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529908,"Woke up at 6:30 and packed up camp. I estimated I had about 4 miles to today’s planned destination. Assuming I could accomplish those miles in 2 hours, I ate only a Kind bar for breakfast and packed all my snacks in my food bag. Dan cooked some food as he was planning on pressing on further than me today. He needs to make the most of his 2 week vacation time. We left camp together but, Dan moved ahead after 2 miles.I was excited for my plan of a day in town and a zero day.   I am trying my best to take it easy on my body. Adjusting to this new lifestyle is physically challenging and it’s important to give your body time to change. I am doing my best to avoid injury and to ease into this adventure. Without much food I made todays miles more difficult! It ended up being 5.8 miles. Ugh why didn't I put my snacks in my belt pouch! I arrived at my planned AT destination at Unicoi Gap. Now I needed to find transportation to Helen, GA.There were 6 other hikers that I knew already here at Unicoi Gap. It’s amazing how you bump into people you thought were way ahead of you. They were also going into town. They had called for a shuttle already and it was coming at noon. However, it was only 10:30am and I am impatient. I wasn’t really sure which direction to Helen; hence I did not know which side of the road to hitch on. Besides what shuttle could take 7 people and 7 large backpacks? Seeing I was the last guy in, I figured hitching was the best option for me.Just then a couple came down the hill off the trail and headed for their parked car. I walked up to them and asked if they knew which direction to Helen. They pointed, ""It’s that way"". I thanked them for the information and headed back to the trail head board. They asked ""do you need a ride?"" and I jumped at my good fortune and accepted. I apologized for my stink as I could even smell myself so I knew I was bad. I put my puffy coat on to help mask it. Not sure if that worked.They were so nice. They were section hiking the trail and doing well at it. They dropped me off at the Best Western Hotel where I checked in for 2 nights! I couldn’t get into the shower quick enough. By 11:30 I was relaxing on the bed and comfortable. Sure enough the other six hikers have the two rooms around me.I walked thru part of town to Wendys, had lunch and then back to the room to nap. I have so few articles of clothing that I can do my wash in the sink rather than find a laundromat, so I did so. For dinner I had a decent steak at a place right next to the hotel. Then back to the hotel to chat with the other hikers for a bit and then off to sleep.I will stay here in Helen one more day to rest. I am looking forward to taking it easy, planning my next few days and resupplying my food.

Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530084,"I opted to take a rest day in the pretty town of Helen, GA. (a zero day). Resupplied my food at a local grocery store, ate lunch and dinner at local establishments, and spent the rest of the day relaxing and enjoying Helen’s pleasant atmosphere. It is challenging to take a zero miles day this early on the journey. The tendency is to go go go. Hopefully in the long run this will pay off for me.

Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530292,"The plan today included a climb up and over Tray Mountain, an elevation gain of approximately 1200 ft. However, before Tray Mountain there was Rocky Mountain providing a climb of about 1000 ft. during the first mile of the day. It was going to be a tough day. I planned on 10 miles or so which would get me to Addis Gap. I was able to hitch a ride to Unicoi Gap and was on the trail by 8:10. A nice musician from the area picked me up in Helen and went out of his way to help me.Soon as I started I knew the trail meant business. Within minutes I was sweating and all those lovely soaps and scents from the hotel were gone. It was hot, humid and I was working hard. I saw no one. I had filled my water bottles with lemon lime Gatorade before I left town. I thought something different than water would be good. Not sure if the Gatorade or all that town food helped me out cause I was moving.Just past Tray Mountain peak I stopped at the Tray Mountain Shelter for a break, water and some food. Two hikers I met in my first day where there taking it easy. It was good to see someone.I had 5 more miles to my planned destination so I took off. The 5 miles went pretty fast and next thing I knew I was at Sassafras Gap. It was way too early to stop and I felt ok so I powered on. As I started the climb out of Addis Gap the rain came. I had second thoughts about my decision. Georgia is known for its hard rain and this rain really let loose. Really regretting my decision now. The good news is my new poncho is a huge improvement and kept my pack dry.Rained for about an hour then the sun came out. I just put my head down and trudged thru it all. Grabbed more water at Deep Gap Shelter and was able to catch a weather forecast. Good chance of light rain all afternoon. I had already done about 13 miles, but I just couldn’t stop so I continued.My feet were hurting a bit and I was tired. I decided to camp just past Dicks Creek Gap. I arrived at 6pm. Glad I didn’t stop at 2 or 3pm. Stretching it out felt good, but we will see what my body says in the morning! Camping alone for the first time. Kind of a loner day today. I think most folks went to a hostile tonight since it’s going to rain. I expect to cross the North Carolina border tomorrow!

Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530451,"Started the day from my camping spot near Dicks Creek Gap where I was the only person to spend the night. I was able to get an early start and was hiking by 7:40. That meant I was breaking spider webs for the hikers behind me. 
Soon though, another hiker overtook me. I graciously turned over web breaking duty to her. I stopped at a shelter at 10:15 to rest and air out my feet. Always feels good to take the shoes off. 
I crossed the GA – NC border around noon time. 
Arriving at the Muskrat Creek Shelter I stopped for a needed lunch break. There were about 6 other hikers and 2 dogs at the shelter. It was a good lunch break and rest. However, everyone seemed to have Standing Indian Shelter as a destination. I figured if I could get close I would camp at a nearby site. No luck though as signs posted not to camp. I ended up tenting at the shelter site with the crowd. There are about 20 people here (and 1 dog). What a difference a day makes!!
I had snacks for dinner and went to my tent at 7. 
I was tired.

Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530620,"This morning I tried to sleep in a bit and give my body some additional minutes of rest. However, on the trail you get up with the birds. I have been taping my feet on some spots that looked like they would want to blister and now I’m taping some chafing as well. The good news is no blisters and the bad news is chafing needs rest. The next town is around mile 109 and I’m at 86.3. My plan is to make it to Franklin, NC within two days. Two days means I will not have to do any crazy long days.Left camp late for me 9:00. The day was good as I tried to slow down and enjoy the hike. I stopped at Carter Gap Shelter at 1:00PM for food. Three other hikers I knew were already there. Suddenly 3 additional hikers (all more mature than me) came in and claimed they were here for the night. I mean I go to bed early but it was 1pm! They were fun to talk to. I fetched them water as I went to get myself some. They knew of Pittsfield, MA and seemed to have sectioned hiked most the trail already.After eating I got out of their way. They already laid out their sleep bags in the shelter.The afternoon hike was hot (estimate low 80’s) and I trudged thru it. Around 2:45 came to an amazing vista and took advantage to rest while taking a few pictures.I arrived at Betty Creek Gap around 4. I was beat as usual. Found a flat spot and starting setting up camp. It is an overused area as there is not any other destination to stay for another 5 miles. That was a little too far of a stretch for me with all my taped spots. So this is home for tonight. It gives me just over 12 miles to do tomorrow to get to town.

Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530716,"I was awoken during the night by what I think was a mouse. Twice he seemed to be walking towards the corner of my tent where my head was. So I tapped on my tent to scare him off. Eventually it went away. I was just happy he didn’t try and chew his way in.Woke up for the day around 7am. Broke down camp, ate some breakfast and filtered some water. I was on the trail by 8:00am. My plan for the day was 12.3 miles and to head into Franklin, NC. However the AT had some challenges for me namely, Albert Mountain. I passed some section hikers like they were standing still and I felt strong to be powering up the mountain. Ten days of constant hiking will do that for your legs. It’s hard to notice when you hike either alone or with other thru hikers.Albert Mnt was a peak at 5250 ft. elevation and provided spectacular views. At least a few times I had to move my hiking poles to one hand and pull myself up via rock or tree. It was incredibly steep. At the top I hit my 100th mile for the AT.After that there were some mildly graded downhills and I was moving fast. The anticipation of a shower must have been the driving force (lol).There were a few other challenging ups and downs just to keep me on my toes. Finally I made it to Winding Stair Gap by 1:30 where a shuttle I called was waiting. I managed 12.2 miles for the day. Looking forward to some town food and a large bed with no mice creeping around. I will be taking a zero on Sunday in Franklin.

Steve Yuill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534408,"Hi everyone I wanted to thank you for following along on my AT journey. I have chosen to end my thru-hike it in Franklin,NC at mile 109. I enjoyed my time backpacking, meeting some awesome hikers and experiencing captivating views. My struggle has been passion. I enjoy the wilderness and wildlife but my thru hiking experience seemed to be more about hurry up and accomplish miles than taking time to enjoy nature. Without that passion fueling me I decided to make the difficult decision to stop.I am thankful that I have learned new things and taken a chance at something I wanted to experience. 
Many folks have asked me ""if I am ok"". I am great! I am so proud and thankful that I had a goal, took the risk to explore it, gained the wisdom that it wasn't the best fit for me. I had the flexibility to adjust my goal and to still use the time I have off of work on things that are a better fit for me!","Winding Stair Gap

I started at AT mile 1549.7 (Lee, MA) and over several day trips made it AT mile 1592.2 (North Adams, MA)Also, away from the trail I took a long weekend trip up to Maine to enjoy the coast and I am going to continue to cherry pick some destinations that I have always wanted to go to and enjoy life.","MA 20 Lee
