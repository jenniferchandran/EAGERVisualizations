LuAnn Patterson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521848,"Today I purchased my backpack and picked up my tent from the store. It's beginning to feel real! I've wanted to do the AT for many years. Work obligations always prevented me from doing so until now. I had toyed with the idea off and on but a few weeks ago I decided the time is now. I was initially planning on starting from Amicalola in mid April but have moved it to mid March as I will be a slow mover and want to make it to Trail Days. I'm not a spring chicken, have a bad back and other health issues not to mention I'm not anywhere near in shape. What I lack in physicality I make up for in determination and being stubborn. I want to make it the whole way but will take it a day at a time and play it by ear. I currently have a tent, footprint, Osprey Aura 65L, carbon trekking poles, water system, footwear, sleeping bag, Thermarest NeoAir XLite. Some food.   I need to determine my clothing and food prep stuff. I have several items in an online shopping cart just waiting for me to finish up.I have chosen my trail name but won't use it until I actually step foot on it.Till then, LuAnn","

LuAnn Patterson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521981,"It was a beautiful day today with temps in the mid 60's. Great day to take my pack & poles out on the trail. I think I did about 3 miles if the trail map is current. The terrain was up & down, lots of rocks and roots. My pack felt good. I think it isn't sitting properly on my hips but it still felt good on my back. Also first time using poles. That went well too. I am tired but not exhausted and could've gone on but didn't want to push my luck.I took in a movie and when I went to stand my left lateral ankle was sort of sore. Will be interested to see how it feels in the morning. Overall I think today was promising.I don't know how much weight I was carrying. I had put in a gallon jug of water along with the other things in it. I wanted to get a good idea of how it would feel. Depending on how I feel tomorrow, I will go back out, take on a different trail/park. Or not. Stay tuned.",,First day with pack,"Feb 27, Sat",0
LuAnn Patterson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522034,Set up the tent. It's an REI Dash 2. Nice little tent. Got the tent itself up but wasn't quite sure about the fly. Will watch some YouTube videos. Get excited. And nervous too. I guess that's natural.,"

LuAnn Patterson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523633,"It's my last night at home. If I haven't acquired something by now, I will be doing without it. I'll be taking an overnight bus to Atlanta. This is a first for me. The bus is said to have wifi and outlets at each seat. I've ridden Marta before though it has been quite a long time ago. I was quite nervous yesterday, having quite the butterflies in my stomach. I'm still nervous but much less so.   Have switched out a few items. Bought a pocket rocket after I realized the one I had previously purchased didn't fold up, plus is quite a bit heavier. Pitched the tent and broke it down again. Got some pointers from the neighbors.Going to miss my daughter and my 2 dogs a lot. I've eaten at most of the places I'll miss this past few weeks. Till next time...","

LuAnn Patterson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523841,"Survived the overnight bus ride, navigating MARTA & getting to the hostel. Yea, pretty tuckered out. Have showered, eaten & am as ready as can be. This place is nice. Three fellas from the UK, a couple from Venezuela & the rest is stateside I guess. There are chickens which will be the source of eggs for breakfast in the morning. There's a dog & cat too. There is a bit of supplies for purchase as well as souvenirs. They also have bins of free stuff downstairs in the kitchen area.   Tomorrow morning will be breakfast @ 0730 & leave @ 0830 for our destinations.","
