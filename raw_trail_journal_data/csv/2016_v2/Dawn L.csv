Dawn L,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523635,"About My Gear List:I work at REI and therefore have the fortunate ability to purchase premium gear at discounted prices. Nothing in my gear list was purchased at full price. It was either purchased on sale, clearance, outlet, employee discounted, or pro-dealed. However, for the benefit of those perusing the list, the prices listed are original full-price pricing. If you are purchasing all your gear new and full-priced, you are doing it wrong. REI offers 10% on full-priced gear they sell to members, and there is always coupons, sales, clearance, outlet, REI Garage Sales, regular garage sales, Craigslist, borrowing from friends and family, etc. Be a savvy shopper. Buy high-quality gear for travels, but try to never pay full retail.","

Dawn L,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527060,"Ok, so I admit that the mad rush to get myself ready for my 6 AM flight (4 AM airport arrival) after working all day was a bad plan.I did it, but I was very stressed and anxious the whole time. I didn't feel even the slightest bit excited. I assumed that feeling would hit me at some point, but this sad goodbye from my job, home, family, and friends was draining.I forgot to organize my things for my bounce box and things I wanted to to leave at home, so I had no choice but to bring it all to organize during my spend in Atlanta.Needless to say lugging that much stuff during travel, probably about 40 - 45 lbs is frustrating. But I'm managing, and hey, my pack will feel much lighter in a few days.So besides the stress, and the poor leg room in economy, I arrived to Atlanta with tears in my eyes and butterflies in my stomach the second I looked out the window and saw the gorgeous miles upon miles of bright green trees with houses and streets sprinkled about. The stark contrast to the Midwest filled me with instant joy as I could finally see the forests calling. I'm officially excited!The stress returned as I got off the plane and tried to figure out what to do with myself. I realized my pack would be easier to lug around wearing it rather than in it's travel duffel, so I put it on and started wandering looking around for somewhere like an airport restaurant to kill time until I got a hold of my airbnb. Just then, a Delta employee in full employee garb, approached me and asked ""Are you thru-hiking the AT?"" And I smiled, relieved to find a local who spoke my language and understood my strange luggage.We immediately bonded as he told me he was in the pre-planning stage of his own thru someday. He told me how he ingests books about the trail and other's adventures to daydream and plan. Being a Delta employee he has been to the Bloomington REI many times, and we had fun chatting about the store.I was carrying an AT hiking memoir that I hadn't quite finished, but I wanted to give it to him. I wrote an inscription and gave him a link to my journal, and told him he should join me on the trail sometime. He was very sweet and has influenced all his children to become outdoor adventurers and passed on his love of getting outside to those around him.Meeting Robert, I made my first trail friend and felt at ease to go about my day full of unknowns knowing there are people out there that get it and will make me feel welcome to this strange land.Since I haven't slept at all, and my nerves were getting shot, I am sitting here at am airport steak restaurant drinking a microbrew (at 10:30 in the morning as strange as that feels), updating my journal and waiting on my airbnb host to make contact for check-in.Plans: check in, organize my stuff finally, and fall asleep ridiculously early... 5pmish maybe? Until next time my friends. Miss everyone already!","Atlanta Airport

Dawn L,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528338,"Do not use Sprint on the AT. I have no service anywhere. Lol. I'm in town today. Will be back on the AT tomorrow.Not much to report. I've been hiking between 4 - 8 miles a day. Some pretty views and my gear has all been excellent after a few shakedowns.Wish I had something more interesting to report, but it's all been very underwhelming in a way.Miss everyone!","

Dawn L,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530109,"Sorry for a lack of journaling.Things have been a little complicated, because for over a week I was miserable and thought I wanted to call it quits. I was chronically dehydrated, malnourished (only eating less than 500 calories per day for lack of appetite), and with little sleep.I finally made some good friends, and due to one losing a wallet, and another leaving to come back with her van, I spent several days in a row in a hotel in Hiawassee. It seems due to the various needs and wants of my friends I'll be a ""Section Hiker"" now with some slack packing here and there. So I'm no longer a purist, but that's ok. I'm going to mark the parts we skip so I can return and finish them later if I so desire. I'd rather not be a purist and stay on the trail and have fun than be a purist and end up giving up and going home. ""Hike your own hike"", right?We're situated with one van now, and today we are going off the trail to stay in a national first campground and visit the Bridal Veil Falls.One of my friends is thinking of getting another van so we can hike without full packs all the time without hiking back. We're still figuring our logistics out.We're currently around Franklin, NC. And will be checking out a national park and some falls off the trail today because some are waiting on a package.Anyway, thanks for reading, and I'll try to post photos tomorrow finally.Miss everyone!","
