Flip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527173,Went to Olena today for training. Covered 12 miles in 4 hours carrying a 25 pound pack. Saw my first snake of the year - a decent sized coral snake about 1 foot and a half long. The wild azaleas were at the end of their blooming season but were still pretty.,"

Flip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529463,"I guess me and the Florida Trail at Suwannee River State Park just weren't meant to be. A couple of months ago I headed up there for a two day trip. I got into the parking lot, put on some bug spray and my boots. Picked up my backpack and felt a sudden rush of water on my leg. I opened the backpack and found the contents floating in water. Turns out I didn't seal the top on my platypus bladder and when I laid the pack in the back of the Jeep, the bladder emptied itself. Soaked everything. Since it was supposed to go into the 30s that night I decided not to continue since it would mean spending the night in a soggy sleeping bag. I have since stopped carrying a water bag and gotten waterproof stuff sacks for all my important stuff.Today it was all set! A carefully organized backpack (waterproofed this time) and goodies to eat including a Thai chicken MRE. Yum! Total weight with food and water - 28 pounds, 6 ounces. When I got to the park I went to pay my entrance fee and the ranger told me to park the car and come on inside. I did, figuring I'd have to fill out a paper or two. I told her I planned to go out about 9 to 10 miles on the FT, camp, and come back the next day. I planned to follow the path on the map I pulled down from the FT Association website that I shared with her. ""That's not accurate"" was her response The map showed I would go up the Withlacootchie, across a bridge then back down the other side of the Withlacootchie to the Suwannee then up river from there. Well, it seems the landowner who previously let the FT go across his land on the far side of the bridge had sold it a couple of months before and the new owner wouldn't allow hikers to cross his land. So the trail was rerouted 2 miles along a paved road then a mile or two down a dirt road, past the banjo music to a boat ramp. The new path turned the 9 mile hike into 12+ mile hike.""Wait. Did you just say banjo music? It looks like the dirt road just goes by a neighborhood.""""That's not a neighborhood - it's a bunch of hunt camps. Most of the hunters aren't there since nothing's in season. But there's some folks that live out there all year round and they don't like outsiders. And they don't chain their dogs.""""Oookayy.. So what if I drove my car down to the boat ramp and parked there?""The ranger looked out the window, turned back to me and said, ""Nice car. I wouldn't park it there if I were you.""""Map says it's a public boat ramp.""""It is,"" she said. ""But the folks who live out there think it's their boat ramp and like I said - they don't like outsiders. I wouldn't park my car there in the daytime, let alone at night.""""I get the feeling you don't think this is a good idea.""""I've lived here all my life and that is the only place around that I'm not comfortable going into alone. I don't know why the ran the trail through there.""So I had a choice. Follow my original plan and ignore the advice of the park ranger (not smart), walk around the trails in the park and camp in the park campground (boring) or regroup and make other plans.So I regrouped. Went to San Felasco for an 8 miler on familiar ground. I'll do it again tomorrow and maybe some stadiums so I'll at least have the back-to-back hikes. The over night trip will have to wait for another weekend.Sigh.","SRSP

Flip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530695,"Good omen to start out. I wasn't 20 yards onto the trail when I got to watch a ruby-throated hummingbird. He flitted around some flowers about 10 feet away from me for about a half a minute.Walking on the Ridge Trail in Gold Head Branch State Park is pretty nice. It's right at the edge of a ridge that looks over the small stream below. The whole area is heavily shaded so it stayed comfortable.Breaking off onto the Florida Trail reminded me why I pretty much stopped hiking in north central Florida. It was walking through sandhills. Mostly pine trees with low laying shrubs. That was the way it was all the way into Camp Blanding. Camp Blanding was interesting. It started out with hardened surfaces that were clearly used for vehicular traffic. It gradually softened to sand, then down to a normal trail. One thing that struck me was that there was little to no trash or vandalism. About the only thing I saw was where some one had tried to chip the orange blaze of a tree with a hatchet or knife. DIdn't interfere with navigation - there were far too many blazes for a single vandal to make an impact. Other than that, the trail was well maintained and clean.I went down a side trail to Lake Lowry. The information on the kiosk said it was one of the most pristine spring fed sand bottom lakes remaining in Florida. It lived up to the hype. It was a beautiful lake. No houses, no boat ramps, no nothing. The only human artifact was a water height gauge that sent measurements back to some where.I tried out my water filter here. Worked pretty well. I filled two water bottles and drank them both before the afternoon was over. So far so good. It tasted just like what it was - spring water. No surprise bacterial infections yet!Overall it was a good day. It was hot (90 degrees by 1:00) and I got a little dehydrated despite drinking four bottles of water over six hours of walking. Guess I'll have to ramp it up a little.Some wildlife early. Deer, rabbits, a gopher tortoise, three snakes and plenty of birds. The snakes were all black racers. By midday, the animals had pretty much disappeared. I guess Noel Coward observation applies to animals as well - Only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun. If it's this hot on the AT when I go to New England in June it's going to be a tough stroll.","Gold Head Branch State Park

Flip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533250,"Torreya State Park for a trial run.Went out on Friday afternoon. Got there about 4 then hiked in a mile and a half to the Rock Creek Primitive Camp site. Very pretty place.Set up camp and worked on all the basic skills kind of things. Made dinner (beef stroganoff with summer sausage instead of beef), set up hammock, hung a bear bag and so forth. Had a little time to explore around the creek before the sun went down.Once I climbed in the hammock, I went sleep pretty quickly. It didn't last long. Hammock camping comes with one inherent problem - the bottom side of your body gets cold. Even in a sleeping bag, this happens since the down in the bag gets compressed from being mashed between the bottom of the hammock and you, ergo, no insulating value. This is known as the ""cold butt syndrome.""The way I've tried to address this is to use the inflatable sleeping mattress I got for tent camping as an insulator inside the hammock. Problem is, it slides around. It gets out from under you, off to the side, all pushed down to the foot end, and so forth. I woke up regularly throughout the night with one part of me or another cold from being off the mattress. Plus the bulk my weight, torso, settled to the bottom of the hammock. For me that is not good. I need to sleep with my head higher than my body to keep the acid reflux to a minimum. That doesn't work when your feet are a foot higher than your body.Basically my hammock plan isn't going to work. I'm still committed to the hammock plan to stay off the ground, but the current plan needs to be altered.Saturday started nicely. Breakfast of champions - Starbucks instant coffee and a strawberry pop tart. Packed up and left camp about 9 thinking 14 miles would be a snap. I do it all the time.I been training for this. Walking two hours a day, stadiums once a week, 10 to 15 mile hikes on the week ends, etc.Well Torreya humbled me. No training that I've done in and around good old flat Gainesville prepared me for the constant ups and downs and roots of Torreya. And these hills were mostly less than a hundred feet. By the end of the day I was dog tired.This was a reality check. I learned that I'm going to have to pay some dues when I go on the AT. I'll need to be prepared for some short days and some constant pain. Nothing can prepare you for walking on terrain like this other than walking on terrain like this. I'll have to learn ""on the job"" since there's really no place around here to practice.Had my first encounter with trail magic. Not a recipient, but as a provider.As I was walking along the Challenge Trail, a man, a woman and their dog came up behind me. They were moving faster than me with no packs. And no water. They had covered the same trail I had (about 5 miles at that point) in 90 degree heat, up and down the same hills that were kicking my butt. The lady, whose name was Evie, mentioned they had foolishly come out with no water and were seriously dehydrated. Except the dog, Lexi, he'd been drinking out of the creeks.   I gave them a liter of my water. The guy, Steve, offer money for the bottle. I declined. When he introduced themselves and expressed thanks he asked me my name. I told him ""Flip"".Well turns out that giving him the water changed my plans. It meant I didn't have enough left to make it through the night and half of the next day. So I headed 4 miles to the picnic area to refill. The park ranger had advised against drinking water from the creeks, even filtered.By the time I got to the parking lot it was after 6. So I had a choice - refill and walk back to the primitive campsite four miles away, or walk 100 yards over to the parking lot and hopping in my car. Going back to the camp would have taken 3 hours and got me there after dark and half dead. Going to the car would get me home in the same amount of time.So the trail magic for Steve, Evie and Lexi turned out to be a game changer.I'm okay with it. I learned a valuable lesson from the shortened trip about my intended equipment, and another one about my personal expectations. Both lessons will serve me well. It was a good trip.Denizen count - two ticks, unattached, six chiggers, and a couple of mosquito bites.","Torreya State Park

Flip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539959,"And now it begins.  Months of preparation and planning all coming together today.First things first.  To all my family, friends and colleagues who have encouraged and supported me I owe my thanks and a large measure of credit for any success I may have.  It never would have gotten this far without you.  Thank you all for believing in me.On the other hand, if it all goes south, I can blame you for not talking me out of this madness. It was a day of firsts for me.  First time I ever rode a NYC bus. A somewhat harrowing experience.  I sat in the front seat next to a guy who had just flown in from Nigeria.  He was more wide-eyed than I was. I guess what stood out most from that little trip was that the lines on the roads seemed to be taken more as suggestions than requirements.  It's a wonder there weren't accidents all over everywhere.The train ride out to Pawling wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped. It was off peak and there weren't many people on it.  A lot of the way it seemed like the tracks were in a ditch with walls on the sides.My first day on the trail was an experience, albeit short.  Got on the trail at 3.  It started with an immediate 500 foot climb up a hill.  That's about 400 feet higher than anything I had to climb on FL. It took a while.  I had to stopped about every 5 minutes the catch my breath. After that it was more like what I'm used to. Overall it took me 4 hours to cover six miles.  Hopefully I'll be able to increase that rate as I get my ""trail legs"".I'm at Wiley shelter the next morning typing this.  Briefly spoke with the other temporary residents of the shelter last night. Four folks named Lookout, McFly, Squint, and SciFi. Given that they are all thru-hikers who started in March in Springer, I probably won't see them again.  They're making 15 to 20 miles a day.Saw my first wildlife other than birds and squirrels which are abundant.  It was a stripped skunk running up the trail in front of me.  Tried to get his picture, but he ducked off into the woods before I could get my phone out.Started raining at about 4 in the afternoon and continued until 3 o'clock this morning.  I'll probably be walking in the rain again today.High point of the day? All the experiences of getting here.Low point? Realization that it may take a bit yet to be physically prepared for this.","Pawling train station

Flip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540085,"First full day on the trail.  Started out leisurely by doing the journal for yesterday.  Same thing I'm doing today. I was a little discouraged by the miles - only 7.1.  I guess that's acceptable considering the altitude changes.  I started the morning with a 600 foot climb up Ten Miles River Hill. First time I've ever tried that.  Took all morning with regular rest stops.That was followed by a trip up this mountain I'm waking up on now.  Schaghticoke Mountain in CT. 989 foot climb over about 2 miles.  Pretty much kicked my butt.  Ended up stealth camping since going to the next shelter would have required another two miles. So I spent the night on the top of a mountain with a great view of the valley below.There are chipmunks all over everywhere!  I must have seen a hundred of them. The animal life up here seems more abundant than florida. I guess the critters down there either migrate away from the heat or hunker down in the day to avoid it.The temp here has been mild  but with 100 percent humidity.  I spent a good part of the day walking in fog.  As a result, most of my stuff is wet.No bug issue to speak of.  Just water. The water from the creeks taste pretty good.Let's see what today brings...","Wiley shelter

Flip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540209,"Another all night rain. Unlike the night before, this one had lightning and thunder.  That was a little creepy since I was camping almost on the the top of the highest land around.Where yesterday was a day for chipmunks, the wildlife of the day was little orange salamanders.  I started out stopping to look at them, but after while they became routine.While walking through PUDs  (pointless ups and downs) I came the the realization that I was going to have to redefine what was meant by ""carry only what you need"".  My pack was simply too heavy and was making progress difficult. So I decided I take zero tomorrow to make adjustments.  I should be able to shed some weight by making a bounce box.  A bounce box is a USPS parcel you send to yourself further down the trail.  When you get to where you sent it, you collect it, take anything out you might need in the next section and put stuff in it you don't. Then you send the box on to another post office somewhere down the trail.  Let the post office carry the weight of the things you won't immediately be using.I'll also spend a little time redefining what my hike is.  There's a saying out here that everyone hikes their own hike.  I judged what I thought I should be doing based on the books I've read.  In retrospect, most of them were written by men under 30.  I think the oldest author turned 40 on the trail. I've talked with several older guys like me. One was a recently retired physician who told me to take it easy.  Bottom line is I shouldn't expect to keep up with the younger guys, either now or in the future. At my age you don't recuperate as quickly and can't sustain the same pace. One guy I talked with while filling water bottles in a flowing stream had been on the trail for ten weeks.  He started in Maryland.  He said the first couple of weeks he was hiking two days then taking a day off. Now he's down to one day in five off. He was looking forward to getting to Kent where a friend was picking him up to go sightseeing along the coast then coming back.  That's hiking his own hike. He was averaging about 10 miles a day when hiking.So I'll be rethinking what my hike is going to be. I'm a 66 year old man, with asthma, and 30 some year history of relative sedentary behavior.  Nothing I've done to prepare actually prepared me for this.  That's the starting point for redefine what my hike will be.Highlight of the day? Talking with other older hikers. Not much chance to talk with younger ones - they blow by me at warp speed.Low point of the day? Having to concentrate on every footfall.  Which means I spent the whole day looking at my feet, dirt, roots and rocks. No time to enjoy the environment I was walking though.","Stealth camp

Flip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540288,"Zero day in Kent CT.  A zero day is one in which you make no forward progress on the AT. Had a nice breakfast at the Cooper Creek B & B where I am staying.  Cooper, one of the proprietors, is a talkative gentleman and kept us amused with stories about the area.Spent a couple of hours in the morning going through every piece of gear I have to decide what it is I actually need for the next week or so.  Managed to prune about 8 pounds of unnecessary gear from the load.  Put it in USPS general delivery to Great Barrington where I'll pick it up next week.Spent a couple of hours in Kent gorging on hamburgers and ice cream. And had a good conversation with Hannah and Matt while sitting under an oak tree in the middle of the Kent park. Weathers beautiful up here.  High today was the highest I've seen to date - 83 degrees.  It's not supposed to get out of the 70s tomorrow.I rearranged my pack about five times this afternoon trying to find the most comfortable packing order for minimizing stress.  After I got it all packed up with everything, including 4 days worth of food and water, I weighed it on the B & B's scale.   The scale is an old doctor's office scale that is probably as old as this house which was built in 1830. Anyway, the new pack with everything came in at 34 pounds. If you do the math and add back in the 8 lbs I sent ahead, it means I've probably been carrying over 40 lbs for the last couple of days.  Not counting the absorbed water from 2 nights of rain and 100% humidity. Taking a day off at this point wasn't in my original plan. But I know it was the right choice to stay safe and on track.  Hopefully a full days rest and recovery, along with a lighter load, will make tomorrow's hike a little more productive and enjoyable. And tomorrow only has one 800 foot plus climb then goes through series of small rises and falls of only a 100 feet or so for the next several miles.

Flip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540410,"First official day of my retirement!  Up until now I've been taking sick leave so I wouldn't have to go back to work after the Nashville trip.  Odd feeling knowing I couldn't go back to work now even if I wanted to.Started today at the B & B in Kent. As I was having breakfast,  I told Connor I was dreading starting the day with a 600 ft climb up a mountain.  We looked at a map and he showed me how the trail started out at the Housatonic River, then went up and over the mountain and then back down to meet with the river road on, of all paces, the Housatonic River.  So you start at a given elevation, climb a long way up then scramble back down the same side of the mountain to the original elevation over a distance of 4.7 miles. Since the trail was laid out here by the Appalachian Mountain Club I guess it should come as no surprise that they take great pleasure in climbing mountains.Then he showed me the rest of the river road.  It's a dirt road going along the river (obviously).  The river road starts about 100 yards from the AT then joins back with it in about a mile. With almost no elevation change.  And the local Audubon recognizes that section of the river as one of the better birding sites in the area.So. I had a choice. A three to four hour slog up and down a mountain or a leisurely stroll along the river checking out the local birds. Did I mention I'm a dues paying member of the Audubon Society?Some of the people out here would look down their noses at me because I'm not walking past every single white blaze on the trail. Oh well.  In an earlier post i mentioned that I was redefining what my hike is.  I want it to be challenging and enjoyable.  PUDS that lead to no views or interesting geological formations are just that for me - PUDs.  Life's too short to bust your butt for no reason. Where there's something cool, I'm game. So I'm kinda tending back toward the original plan I had when Liz and I first started talking about this - section hikes.  Do the cool stuff and forget the long tedious mind-numbingly dull parts.I actually met a guy today who was doing just that.  His trail name was Locomotive.   Didn't ask him how he got it.  He was on this trail because he wanted to do Bear Mountain so he was doing it.  Last week he did Mount Mousalake in New Hampshire.  And next week he was headed for Baker Mountain in Vermont. Cherry picking he called it.  He had a great attitude and seemed to be enjoying himself.  He was my age.So overall it's been a delightful day. I've covered 10.1 miles on relatively unstrenuous ground and seen a lot of local birds.  Some I'm not even sure what they were so could be additions to my life list.  Unfortunately, with no binoculars or camera, positively IDing them is difficult.Right now it's about 430 in the afternoon and I have already set up camp for the night at the Silver Hill Shelter. It's kind of early, but the weather forecast is for a front to move through that will have a lot of rain associated with it.  So I'm hunkering down. Also resting up for what will probably be a grueling day tomorrow. The climbs and descents one right after the other. Looks to be 400, 500 then 300 foot ups and downs.  And all to cover less than four miles as the crow flies.  PUDS.  Humbug.The rain is staring and the wind has picked up now.  Looking to be a stormy evening.","Kent

Flip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540600,"Well, it rained all night again. Started out with a real gully washer.  Three hikers had a planned to stay under the pavillion.  A pavillion on the trail is like a shelter but it has no raised floor.  Just a gravel bottom at ground level.  When the rain really started coming down, the hikers found out the hard way that it was actually on a lower point of the surrounding terrain.  After about fifteen minutes they were ankle deep in water. I mentioned yesterday that another couple with a dog also got flooded out. Basically everyone but me had all their stuff soaked.There was another low spot in the campground.  It was right under my hammock.  That's one of the positive parts of hammock camping - you are off the ground.  I stayed high and dry through the flood.  Everything was clammy and sticky from the humidity, but at least it wasn't dripping wet.I also experienced a down side to hammock camping.  I had to spend 14 straight hours laying in the hammock. Staying still for that long wasn't much fun.Got an early start.  Left camp about 8 and planned to do the three mountains I was complaining about yesterday then stopping at a shelter and recooping.  I decided to stop complaining about the PUDS.  They are a part of the trail just like speed limits are on a highway so I'll just deal with them.Anyway, I got to that shelter by 1130 and decided it was too early to stop. So I had some lunch, filled up on water and set out for the next shelter which was over the next, higher mountain. When I got there, there was no water.  So I headed out for the next shelter.  No water there either. No options at that point but to go to the next shelter in hopes there was water there.  There was and that's where I camped for the night and where I am now.It was weird.  For three days I walked and slept in rain.  There was  water everywhere.  Then I went over the top of a mountain, and it hadn't rained in weeks. Seems like the local trial club could have put up a warning.  I passed six sites that both trail guides I have said had reliable water sources.  None of them did.Not a bad day overall.  I covered 12.1 miles and climbed and descended 7 ""mountains"". They call everything up here a mountain even if it only rises 4 or 500 feet above the surrounding area.  I would call it a hill.  Perhaps there is some technical reason it's called a mountain that don't know about.I plan on a shorter day today and going in Falls Village for a good meal.

Met, walked with and had lunch with a guy named Dr D.  He's 58 and was a professional chemist.  About four years ago he was given a package to retire early when the company downsized.  Since then he's been working in a warehouse loading appliances on trucks. He hated it so he quit.  Now he's through hiking.  Started four months ago. All he does is walk.  20 to 25 miles per day. He said he stopped enjoying it months ago but is determined to finish it.  He said that's a pretty common thing for through hikers.  After lunch he left me in a cloud of dust so he could complete his quota for the day. As he put it - the sooner I get done, the sooner I won't have to do it any more.I had only planned to go to Limestone Springs shelter, 5.6 miles away since I did a couple of big days prior (big for me anyway).  I got there about 230 and decided I didn't feel like sitting around an empty shelter for six hours before it got dark.  So I struck out for the next shelter on Mt Riga.Stopped in Salsbury to resupply.  It was about 5 when I got back on the trail.  To get to the shelter I had to climb from 650 feet to 1670 feet.  I made it about half way by 630 and decided I wouldn't be able to make to the top by dark so I set up a stealth camp by a little brook.  Took a bath in the brook.  A sponge bath.  Well, bandana bath if you come right down to it.  It was really cold.  First bath in 3 days.  With no soap it didn't get all the crud off, but it did cut through the sticky residue from all the bug spray.  I may not smell a whole lot better, but feel somewhat better.I hung all my food and other aromatic stuff 20 feet up tree about 200 feet way from where I am camping.  There have been no reports of bears around here for some time.  Mostly it's to keep the mice and chipmunks out of it.Tomorrow I'll go the rest of the way up Riga (to 1670), then down a couple hundred feet (of course), then to the top of Bear Mountain. Bear Mountain is the tallest in CT at 2316 feet. So I have about 1300 feet of climbing tomorrow. Coming down Bear Mountain is supposed to be scary because you're descending on some ledges.I got in 11.7 miles today not counting the 1.9 sideways miles.  Sideways miles are when you're walking off trail like going in to town to get a hamburger or resupply.  But I'm only going to try for 5.4 tomorrow with all the climbing.","Belters camp site

Basically, the elevation drops about 200 feet over a horizontal run of maybe 50 feet.  There are parts where the climb down is probably at 80 to 85 degrees.About half way down I slipped on a rock and fell about 20 feet.  They say when you're falling everything is in slow motion.  I don't think that's true.  The fall was over before I had time to shout a profanity.  I do remember bouncing twice, smacking into a tree and doing a face plant between two big rocks with feet up to the sky.  My backpack was trying to pull me over to continue the fall.  An Asian couple held on to me and helped me get it off.  Unforgivable, I didn't even ask their name.  I ended up with a goose egg on my forehead, a busted up nose, both knees banged up, both shoulders and one elbow.  As I sat on the side of the trail for 20 minutes trying to get my nose to stop bleeding, two others slipped on the same rock.  Fortunately, none of them crashed as hard as I did.The incident scared me.  The knot on my forehead came from a small tree about 2 inches in diameter at the side of the trail.  If that tree had not been there, the next obstacle in line for my head was a sharp edged rock.  It would have popped my head like a melon. If the Asian couple hadn't been there I could probably have tumbled further down the hill. It could have all ended right there with just that simple slip of a foot over a rock. Shines a different light on the notion of rethinking this hike. Although today wasn't hiking - it was more like rock climbing.I chose CT as a place to start because the mountains here are shorter.  Around 2000 feet max compared to 5 to 6000 in NH and NC.  One of the AMC members I met after the fall said most people don't realize how rough these mountains are.  That's why locally they refer to them as the Gnarlies.I believe putting the rest of these mountains on hold would be prudent. I think a flip might be in order to allow me time to better hone my skills.In any event, I hobbled down the mountain and got a ride in Great Barrington MA. That's where I am now.  Sitting in a hotel room licking my wounds.  I sent a picture or my nose to Liz and Hannah.  Hannah says I look like Tyrion Lannister. Tomorrow I'm going to rent a car and drive down to visit Cal and Sandy for a couple of days.  Then I'll decide where to continue my hike.  Probably somewhere less life threatening.One other note.  When  I got to the hotel the first thing I did was take a shower to wash off five days worth of grunge.  When I got out, I realized I didn't have any clean clothes to put on.  I knew I smelled bad on the trail, but it kinda dissipates and everybody else smells too.  In an enclosed motel room it's rather powerful.","Brook on Riga Mountain

Flip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540907,"At my brother's house in Tolland CT. Beautiful home.Yesterday was a bit of a scary day for me.  That along with the lack of congruence between my expections and the reality of the AT has put me in the position of seriously rethinking my AT plans. I shall do that rethinking in consultation with my beautiful bride.In reflection, I can offer some insight into what happened here.  It may not be of any value to you but it helps me put my thoughts and feelings in order.Someone asked if this was a lifelong dream or goal for me.  The answer to that is no.  It had been a stray thought on occasion, but never a real burning desire. So what happened there?  I think it all became an escape mechanism.  All the planning, reading books, learning about procedures and methods for living on the trail were a positive and uplifting train of thoughts.  They helped me to deal with unhappiness and frustration in the professional career.  My job had become redundant, frustrating, and, to me, largely irrelevant.  I was going to work and going through the motions.  I did what was expected of me knowing that it was pointless to do so.  The results of my activities were not really used in any productive ways to make things better for the kids.  Focusing a lot of mental effort on learning about life on the AT became a positive distraction from the frustration of the job.Other factors came into play during this period as well.  I have always been a hiker and someone who enjoys being outside looking around.  I hiked all the trails in North Florida.  Hiked several parts of the AT as well - in Georgia and Southern Virginia.  Enjoyed those too.  Did the Florida Master Naturalist program.  I'm a birder.  Shoot, being interested in the natural world goes back a long way with me. My first college degrees were in zoology.  And I think a little confusion came to play here.  I equated hiking with backpacking.  They are not the same thing.  Not even close.  And the commonly used jargon ""hiking the AT"" is a little deceptive  based on how I view hiking.  The trail is a backpacking experience. It is a life style.Well when I got out there, I quickly came to realize that checking out the environment was not going to happen.  I think I commented on one of the first days that all I had been looking at all day were my boots stepping over tree roots, rocks and dirt.  If something interesting didn't show up right in front of my feet, I didn't notice it.  That part of the experience was simply missing. And it was a major expectation on my part.The scare yesterday was a punctuation on the feelings that had already developed.  I forced me to answer a few basic questions.First, is this something I could physically do?  I think it is.  I could feel myself getting physically stronger and able to deal with that over the long haul. Sure, there were a few missteps, slips and stumbles.  But that's to be expected given I was in an environment I wasn't used to (of course assuming one of the stumbles wasn't game ending.) So physically I think it was within my ability)Second, is this something I could do mentally?  To answer that I can point out that I have multiple degrees up to the highest offered from a prestigious land grant institution.  That ""stick-to-it-ive-ness"" took years to come to fruition.  I think I have the mental stamina to stick to something like the AT for six months. Afterall, I did stick with my frustrating job long after I could have freely left.Then what was it? All I can offer is that I simply did not enjoy it and saw no reason to continue that would provide a long term benefit.  To continue given how much I disliked it would have been only to save face.  But I don't think I need to save face with the people I care about. I think they'll accept my decision for what it is. There is also a selfish element.  I discovered in this short period of time that I do not want to be away from Liz, Hannah, my family and friends.  I want them all more tightly tied to my life, not held at arms distance. It didn't take me long to figure that out. The little mishap yesterday  (falling off a cliff) made that possibilty crystal clear.  One occurrence, however random or unexpected, could take all that I truly cherish away from me.  And that is completely unacceptable.Will I miss anything this?  Yes.  This.  I've kind of enjoyed putting my thoughts down like this and sharing them with others.  I won't have that now.I'll continue hiking because I enjoy it.  And some of it will have a backpacking element and will involve the AT.  I'm already considering another short trip in Georgia.  When that happens I'll let yall know and post a few more things on this blog. But the plan of a long-distance long-term backpacking life style on the AT is not in the cards. Thanks for listening.","Great Barrington

Flip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543753,"Good day overall.  I accomplished something hard, learned some new things and met some nice people.First up I climbed Blood Mountain.  Climbed might be the wrong verb.  It's probably more accurate to say I hiked up Blood Mountain. From where I started to the top of the mountain was 2.7 miles with an increase in elevation of 1,342 feet.  Made it up in 2 hours and 10 minutes and back down in about an hour.The folks who designed the trail in GA clearly had a good understanding of the term switchback.  There were many on this climb and they made the trek safer and more interesting. Perhaps they had to do it that way.  Given that literally thousands of people start the trail down here, switchbacks would be a safety factor.  If all those novice hikers had to go up these hills without them, the death toll would be unaccepatable if the climbs had been like CT.  It also explains why some of the thru hikers.I met in CT complained about the trails up there. I ate lunch at the top of the mountain with a couple from Macon.  The man, Jim, was climbing the mountain for the first time since he did it as a boy scout - 49 years ago. He didn't remember it as being so tough.  Jan, his wife, was doing it for the first time.When I came down, I went into the outfitter store at Neels Gap. This is mentioned in all the books I've read because the trail goes though the middle of the store. Figured I had to do that to get the full effect.  While sitting outside on a picnic bench drinking a cool beverage and having a snack, I talked with a couple of other hikers. Both started at Springer.  One planned to do all of GA and the other planned to go the Dicks Creek Gap.  Both quit at Neels Gap.  The guy who was planning on going to Dicks Creek called a shuttle to take him the rest of the way.  The other, Derek, wasn't able to get transportation  back to Amicalola to pick up his car.  So I took him there.He was a nice guy.  Recently ETSed from the Army as a fuel specialist and mechanic.  Did a tour in Afghanistan taking care of vehicles for the 3rd Rangers.  Small world.  He's now working for home depot in Atlanta. He was stopping because he was not making the miles he needed to in order to finish on time.  He didn't realize it was going to be as hard as it was.  He figured 12 to 15 miles a day would be a snap.  He was averaging 7.  Sound familiar?The other guy who quit (didn't hear his name) had a problem with pack weight.  He was carrying camera equipment with multiple lenses and a tripod and coffee grinder and brewing system, etc.  Probably 50 pounds of junk.  Needless to say, it slowed him down so he wasn't getting his miles in either.After dropping Derek off at Amicalola, I went to Hiawassee.  It's supposedly a trail town where hikers go to resupply.  It was pretty much like all the other small towns around here.  I think it's just because it's a convenient trip from the trail.So I learned three things.  First, I enjoyed the hike today.  It was challenging, had an objective, and had a finish line that wasn't just another grubby little campsite on a map. Second, hiking is much easier and you go quicker and are more stable when you're only carrying about 15 pounds.  And third, going downhill is a lot easier when you set your hiking poles for the longest length.  It allows you to reach the ground further down the hill without having to bend forward to do it.So overall a good day.  Tomorrow a hike to a water fall that can only be reached from the AT.","Neels Gap
