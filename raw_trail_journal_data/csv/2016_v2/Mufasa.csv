Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527529,"I have been working for 3 months dehydrating foods like jerky and fruit rolls ups and preparing trail mixes. I bought tons of groceries. At least $1000 worth so far I think. During the month of April I have finally organized all my random meals into daily portions. So far, I am barely able to reach an estimated 2000 calories for each daily bag. So I'll need to start doubling portions and buying even more food! I have not planned out my stops yet and how much food I will need, so sometime this week I will start mapping that out. Today I completed my first 7 days worth of food. It feels really good and like my first official accomplishment.. Well second, buying all my gear was a big first step! this has all been a really exciting experience and I can't wait to post more! 24 more days till I hit the trail in West VA! I can't wait!! ??",,Food Prepping,"Apr 11, Mon",0
Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531228,"What's up everybody! Mufasa in the house! I haven't journaled in a while, which worries me that I won't do it as often as I planned on the trail. Though I hope I do. The good news is that I have been keeping up with my blog (snog, I call it) through Snapchat. Feel free to add me if you like, username: saylind.vettloI will try to update my stories through snapchat whenever I get service.Since I last wrote, I have left my job and road tripped to VA from Florida. My AMAZING family and friends got together to throw me a surprise going away party before I left FL, complete with a hiking theme, camping gifts, great food, and booze. It was such a special event in my life; I have never felt so much love and support. It is truly helping me prepare for the journey that is up ahead of me. This experience has been incredible and I haven't even fully immersed myself yet. I can't wait for what's next to come.After I left home, I have spent tons of quality time with family and friends - new and old. I went to Macon, GA, then to Atlanta. In Atlanta I did my first and only trail prep that I will be able to get in. I hiked a mile to the top of Stone Mountain. I got to wear my boots for the first time, my clothes, and I brought my (school) backpack with my camelbak bladder and some other items which made my bag weigh about 10 lbs. Hiking to the top of the mountain was surprisingly difficult. It wasn't excruciating, but it was much harder than I expected and it was really hot. Once I got to the top, I drank my gatorade and ate a Clif Bar, by the time I made my way down, I felt great and like my normal self. So, I'm not sure if the hike up was tough because I needed that bar and the electrolytes, or if I am just super out of shape and that was a moderately difficult ascent (or a combo of the two!). So once I descended, I hiked around for about 4 or 5 more miles. My under armour shirt is amazing. My shorts were terrible though. I have a hard time finding shorts that my thunder thighs don't like to eat! lol I thought they were loose enough to not matter, but they still rode up.. and it sucked. So, hopefully my other pair of shorts will be better.. I plan to test them out tomorrow. My darn tough Vermont socks worked well, and I used my camelbak with ease. I really love having the water tube to drink from, I even used it in the car for the rest of my road trip to Va! Sadly, my shoes rubbed on my pinky toes. I will have to wear blister guards on them. Im used to this happening with all my shoes. It wasn't so brutal that I couldn't handle it, but I'd prefer that my feet don't hurt when I hike. Maybe once I break in my shoes on the trail, they will widen and not hurt my toes as badly..?. All in all, the hike was a great experience. I can't wait to get started in the next few days in WVA.After Atlanta, I road tripped to Va Beach with my 90 year old grandma! It wasn't apart of my original plan, and I ended up skipping my hike at Roanoke to see McAfee's knob, but I know I will be able to go there some day.So now I am out in DC putting together the final preparation for my hike. I am reunited with my backpack that I left here in December and I am a little worried to see what it's like when I actually put it on! I still have my food to put in their separate gallon sized bags and USPS boxes. Tomorrow my brother and I will go to REI to pick up my remaining essential items which will include my jet boil, gas canisters, and trekking poles. I can not even believe that I am supposed to start the trail in 3 days. It is crazy! My life is about to change so much. Like I said, I've gotten tons of love in the past month, it is going to make starting the trail even harder! I'm used to goodbyes and being alone.. I value my alone time very much.. but everyone is definitely going to make it tough my first couple weeks out there. So thanks a lot people! haha jk love you all and thank you for all that you have done for me. Linny out.PS: Remember who you are!!","Springfield, VA

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532370,"Hola! I am still at home. I was supposed to start the trail last Friday (4 days ago), and my date keeps getting pushed back. I have been busy, busy, busy! I FINALLY completed all my food prep. In total, I have put together 83 days worth of food. It was SO much work. It took me about 1-2 hours to fill each box of food.. which I am currently putting 7 days to a box - with 12 boxes in all. I am hoping that my hard work pays off out on the trail when it comes to being tempted to splurge in towns, also, I won't need to make grocery store runs - which means less hitchhiking and less time spent on not hiking and relaxing out on the trail.My parents have helped me out tremendously with expenses and caring for my cats, and now they are taking me to Harper's Ferry in the morning so I don't have to take 3 trains to get there. I AM SO EXCITED!The past couple days have been stressful. I've been up late working until 1-2am trying to get everything ready to go. Last night I packed my pack -way easier than expected. And I tried it on for the first time, I still have my water to add to it - which will be super heavy, but for now, it's not too heavy at all. This is VERY good. I thought for sure that I would have too much stuff. I LOVE my Osprey bag. It is adorable and functional, a great fit. Today, I am going through my boxes and reorganizing my food so that there's variety in my weekly meals. I have not eaten ramen or packaged soups since I was in my first year of college. I have a feeling I will get sick of it all REAL quick, so I am thankful to have this extra day to be able to organize my boxes to where I won't eat oatmeal 6 days in a row.I planned out all my drop box stops the other day. I have no clue if there's any accuracy, but I'll find out real soon.Also, I took a 2mi walk with my grandma, up and down my parent's hilly neighborhood. My hiking boots were no trouble to my pinky toes at all in my regular socks. So it must be the Moreno wool socks are too thick and causing them to rub. I will look for a Darn Tough runner socks out on the trail if my toes really bother me.I am still keeping up daily with my *Snog*.

May 11th, 2016 - MY LIFE JOURNEY BEGINS. It is also my oldest sister's birthday, so now it is even more special. Wish me luck!!! See you tomorrow at Harper's Ferry my fellow AT hikers!!

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532473,"Oh my gosh!! We are on the way to Harper's Ferry, no turning back now. I am so excited! My dad and brother are in tow. We even have Geno with us. I hope to keep everyone updated as much as possible. Hopefully my service won't be too terrible.My pack weight at home weighed in at 45lbs.. I'm pretty proud of myself for keeping it way lighter than I thought I could. I also weigh in at 175 lbs :-O !! Hopefully that number will go down real fast out on the trail but I know not to expect it to. I am really looking forward to daily exercise and being surrounded by the beauty of nature. I have never weighed this much for so long (it's been a year now) I hope the trail whips me into shape and that there's no going back to an unhealthy lifestyle from here on out. I have done a great job blocking out worries and calming myself from fears and doubt so far. I've made sure to include plenty of treats in my boxes to make my trip just a tad easier and encouraging for myself. I'll hopefully journal tonight after my first day. Thank you to all the people who came into my life at just the right time. Thank you for all of your love and support. Thank you for your help.

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533137,"Today was a great day! I pushed myself harder than I planned but I got through it. My dad, my brother, and I started at Harper's Ferry. We took in the beautiful sites and started out on the trail. We got to the split from the trail that goes along the Potomac river, which then turns left over the railroad tracks and goes up the mountain. We read the map at this location incorrectly and saw that we only had 3 miles to get to the next stop. It was getting late and I wanted my brother and dad to make it to my first shelter stop on the AT. We decided we could make it if we hurried. We focused on getting there quickly and hiked through the pain and the pouring rain. We got to the stop 3 miles out and realized we had gone the wrong way! I was just so focused on making it that I didn't think to look for the white blazes. Thankfully, my brother took my 45lb backpack and hiked it back to the split for me. When I finally got there, we parted ways and I continued up the mountain for 3 more miles. The 6 mi detour was a pain, but the beautiful rain falling down all around us was so calming. I've always loved the rain. So my first day I ended up hiking 13 miles. I hiked for almost 7 hours. The last 3 miles of my journey on the trail, the rain stopped. As I entered the woods a giant Woody the Wppdpecker greeted me. Laugh all you want, but I've never seen a woodpecker that big before! Lol I also saw geese, a raccoon, and a turtle. At the shelter, I met Canbot and Hobbs, Virginia Tortoise and Ranger, Lucky Duck and 2 girls, and there was a big group of high schoolers from Ohio. Everyone was so nice and helpful. I was too tired to eat anything my first night. I just read some of my book and tried to pass out. My first night ever camping outdoors was a success! It wasn't easy though. The shelter floor is so hard, I couldn't get comfortable. I tossed and turned all night bc I was so sore. I did get some sleep and I woke up bright and early at 6am and hit the trail at 7am the next day.","Harpers Ferry

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533138,"Woke up at 6am with Ranger and VA Tortoise. Tortoise was kind enough to share water and I cooked my first warm meal -oatmeal! Thankfully, ranger shared some ibuprofen with me and I hit the trail with minimal pain. I started out at 7-7:30am. I hiked through Gathland State Park. It was very pretty. Got to see Cabot and Hobbs probably for the last time (they started at Springer and avg 20 mile days). They were so sweet and a great first couple to meet out here. I got to Rocky Run around 2-3pm, set up my tent for the first time and just relaxed. It was a lovely afternoon. I enjoyed taking it easy outdoors. I had my tent set up between two running creeks. It didn't rain much today and o really love my pack. It holds all that weight so well. I wish I could hike more but my feet kill me. I wonder if it's just because my shoes aren't broken in. It was tough going downhill with the rocks. It's funny how my feet hurt on the first day and I would purposely step on the rocks at the middle of my feet just to ease the pain. Now I find myself wishing for mud or soft ground to walk on. I got a blister on one of my toes today. I made it though, and taking my shoes off and walking in the cold creek is the best feeling. I ate some chicken salad and crackers on a rock and then read my book. I fell asleep in my tent while listening to the wind blowing through the trees and the water running. I woke up and hung up my bear bag and put on some PJs. I took a Tylenol PM and tried to relax. I was really nervous sleeping alone outdoors in a tent for my first time. I decided to be brave, I guess it was really my only option anyways. I didn't have anyone but myself to protect me this time. I dozed off around 8 or 9 and I woke up in the middle of the night feeling incredibly calm and tranquil. There were weird animal screeching noises down the way, they alarmed me but they didn't bother me. I was so peaceful listening to the creeks and the rain falling on my tent. I slept so well. I woke up around 9:30am. I was so proud of myself. I know now that I can truly do this after all. Follow my snapchat blog. It's easier for me to update than this journal.

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533795,"So sad that my original entry for this day deleted. So here it goes from memory 5 days later:Today was a good day! The last couple uphill miles were rough. My feet hurt as usual. It was well worth the pain to get to this campsite. I ran into the caretaker who was incredibly nice. I believe his name was Kyle. He gave tons of tips and good info about the trail up ahead. He thruhiked SOBO last year or so ago. I also set up my tent next to a nice lady named Annamaria. She was there with her dog Medusa. Both total sweethearts! I went down to check out the view, and to my surprise, I ran into Ranger and VA Tortiose. I was SO happy!!!! I love catching up with Ranger. He walked me down to the STUNNING view. Absolutely gorgeous. I loved it so much. I was sure to hobble back over to my tent and set everything up and cook dinner quickly so I could make it back over to the rocks to see the sunset in time. It was sooooo nice. I'm so happy I made it to Annapolis Rocks and didn't stop early at Pine Knob Shelter. In addition to getting the best view, tons of tips from Kyle, reuniting with Ranger and Atlas, and meeting a new friend -Annamaria; I also slept so peacefully and had the best sleep last night in my tent. The woods were so quiet. Medusa apparently laid at my tent until I fell asleep (she's a service dog). It was just incredible. I felt great when I woke up! Ranger and VA Tortoise and I decided to take it easy today- the 14th- so we could have pizza delivered to us at the next shelter. (Thank heavens for this decision bc the next day was rough!)I took one more good look at the view, soaked it all in and was on my way. I signed the log book on the way out and chatted with Kyle before hitting the trail. Follow my SNOG for better updates and pics.

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533796,"Started off at 9am this morning. Today was a rough day on the rocks. It was only 6 mi from Annapolis Rocks but it felt like 10. I had to jump and hop up and down from Boulder to Boulder. I'm glad Ranger and VA Tortoise and I decided to make today an ""easy"" day because it was brutal! I saw a beaver today and 2 frogs. Chipmunks are all over since I walked past the battlefield a couple days ago. There's tons of millipede things crawling all over. I got to the Cowall shelter at 2pm. All my friends were there. It began to pour down rain immediately after I got to the shelter and some boy scouts flocked to the shelter for cover. The rain stopped about 30 min later and we finally ordered our pizza and cokes! We walked down to the road from the shelter to pick it up. We soon realized that the language barrier caused us to order six 2L cokes! And they told us they were ""small"" lol. It was a biatch to haul it back up to the shelter, but the 3 of us made it. Of course all the sodas were gone by the morning. So many people ended up coming to the shelter tonight. More than 22 people camped and tented last night. Everyone ordered pizza after we did. We started a fire and we all hung out talking and had a great time. It was a super windy night, scattered rain showers too. It was my coldest night yet. I tossed and turned and didn't get much sleep. I'm having my mom send my sleeping bag liner in my first box!Friends from the shelter today: Polar Bear, Lucky Duck, Jenny & Dreaming Sunflower, Stonecold, Fiber, Brandon, Ranger & VA Tortoise, Annamaria & Medusa, Reese & his dad, and many many more!Follow my SNOG for better updates and pics.

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533797,"I slept terribly last night. It was so cold and windy. I got up right at 6:11am and packed my stuff as fast as possible and hit the trail in hopes to warm up. The wind was blowing so hard it was rough! 5 minutes into the trail, I warmed up and took off my jacket. The wind wasn't blowing as hard and it turned out to be another gorgeous day. I got out of the woods and walked into a field with a lovely view. It feels so good to be able to see for miles and miles after being in the woods for a while. The sky and the clouds were spectacular. I was finally feeling great, but definitely tired from the lack of sleep! I hiked a little ways to High Rock to check out the view. It was windy and a little scary up on top, but I took some pictures and talked to a few people. Another awesome view. After I left High Rock I ran into Brandon from the shelter last night. We hiked at about the same pace and it ended up being a great fit. Hiking with a buddy really makes a difference! We hiked to Penn-Mar park together and then we took a break. The wind was seriously hardcore. I took some pics of another lovely view and then went to the ground by the shelter to escape the wind. My hands and toes went numb from the cold! Brandon crashed a 50 year olds birthday party and charged his phone and I ended up following suit later. It was a pretty hilarious scenario at the time. Another hiker that Brandon met before came to the shelter about 10 min after us. He is really cool, has a great personality. He reminds me of Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs. His name is Bob. He's a section hiker so he doesn't have a trail name. He stuck around for a bit and then hiked on.I went to the bathroom and washed my hands, arms and face thoroughly. I felt SO much better after that!Brandon and I decided we make a great team and that we'd push on the extra 4.7 miles to Deer Lick Shelter. I definitely couldn't have done it without him. Idk what I would've done if we hadn't met up together, I would've been stuck at PennMar cold and exhausted and in jeopardy of getting in trouble for camping nearby. We finally made it to the shelter. It was my biggest hike yet- 15.5 miles! We were totally exhausted, but Bob, Brandon and I had the whole shelter to ourselves, which was great. We gathered firewood and started a fire. We set up our tents inside the shelter in hopes of keeping warm. Bob taught us how to hang out bear bags from a tree. Our goal for tomorrow is 10 miles to Rocky Run shelter. Now that we've made it to Pennsylvania, only 8 more states to go!!Follow my SNOG for better updates and pics. Snapchat username: saylind.vettloRemembereth who thou ar-eth.","Ensign Cowall Shelter

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533798,"Omg, what a day!!! It was exhausting and hard, relaxing and so much fun! Brandon and I started out on the trail together this morning. There was no rain and the weather was nice. There were some big climbs where we ran into Reese and his dad and we all hiked together. About an hour or so into our hike, Polar Bear passes us and asks if we were planning on heading to the bar that's coming up in a couple miles. Brandon and I both looked at each other and knew we had to reroute to get some beers! The books, and the lady at the post office confirmed that it was only .9 miles away from the trail, but it was definitely at least half a mile more!! My feet were in so much pain that I was on the verge of tears by the time I reached the post office. I mailed off some of my stuff to drop weight, although it's not much. But it included my selfie stick, mini bible, my sleeping bag compression sack (bc I like my osprey one better and I didn't know till I got here that my bag came with one), my standing up pee funnel (sorry Aimee!), and my travel bidet (sorry Aubree!). I just don't have the balls to test out and try those last 2 things out here on the trail. Esp since its been so cold. After the post office, I walked up to the bar and enjoyed a great meal (bacon cheeseburger and fries) with Brandon and Reese. I found out from the guest book that Polar Bear is also from Springfield, VA and even went to the same school as my little brother! Such a small world!Reese ended up heading back to the trail early to meet up with his dad and push on to the next shelter. Brandon and I stayed back to play pool, drink a few more beers, and take it easy because we knew we only had a few more miles to get to our next shelter. I think we stayed there for like 3 or so hours before we hit the road to head back to the trail around 3:30pm. I guess the beers had us feeling great bc by the time we got to the shelter we decided we could definitely keep going. We ran into a man taking care of the trail and he was really nice and told us we could stealth camp at a spot about 2 miles down the trail. He also gave us some homemade wooden spoons - we found out later that he's trail famous.. Lucky us!! So we decided to go for those 2 extra miles... And then we decided we were so close to the Caledonia State Park that we could make it to the next shelter after resting there for a bit. We got to the park and my feet were killing me by then as usual. I took off my boots and stood in the water for about 5 min to help with the swelling. Then I went back to the bench and elevated them on my bag. This is when Brandon double checked our book and realized we still had 2.6 miles to get to the next shelter and not 1! I could've died! It was getting late and we haven't night hiked yet, so I put my shoes back on without taping up my feet and we got back on the trail. A little ways down we come up to the AT going up a hill. It's marked with a sign and at the very bottom right in black and white there's a zig zagging upward arrow and writing below stating the this part of the trail was ""most difficult""!! We laughed so hard at the site of it and swallowed our dread and fears and kept pushing on step by step. I was about to cry while laughing at the same time. We did not want to push these extra miles! We eventually got there right before dark. There was room in the shelter for one more and I took the spot while Brandon put up his tent in front of the picnic table under the shelter. I took off my shoes and I lost my pinky toe nail. I was too exhausted to do anything but admire how beautiful and quaint Quarry Gap Shelter was and then pass out. It was a 17.8 mile day for us, it sucked but was awesome and I wouldn't take it back! I really enjoyed the bar in town and running in to the wooden spoon man.Follow my SNOG for better updates and pics. Snapchat username: saylind.vettloRemember who you are!","Deer Lick Shelter

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533799,"Today was a slooooww day. Probably because we overdid it yesterday. It was so cold and rainy. It's the first time I've actually felt miserable on the trail. I knew I wasn't going to make it far with the slump that I was in! I had to listen to music and to an audio book (The Nightingale) just to get through it today! So glad I was able to charge my phone at the bar the other day, idk how I would've made it without my music and book today. Luckily, Brandon was feeling slow today too and we decided to definitely call it quits early and stop at the next shelter. It turned out to be a great day after a much needed nap! We relaxed and hung out with Dirty Jobs. We got a fire started and I caught up on getting my journal entries logged on my notes in my phone. Tomorrow I'll have wifi and can finally post them! :DStonecold, a hiker called LP (Lost Pony.. Which I wrote incorrectly on my SNOG the other day), and England joined us at the shelter. We all hung out (minus England who was exhausted from hiking 60 mi in THREE DAYS!!) around the fire and shared stories. We dove into stories about creepers some of us have come across on the trail and about murders that occurred in a VA shelter.. The stories and the day nap didn't help me get back to sleep too well when I woke up in the middle of the night lol but I put my Nightingale story back on and passed out quickly.

We found tons of American flags, a broken wooden gate, and 1 blue bowl. Apparently it was a science project -not to be touched. We got into town around 2pm and a bunch of hikers were hanging out outside the general store. We all ordered the hiker burger and it was SO incredibly amazing!! So so good. Everyone needs to eat this burger! Haha It had cheese inside the burger oozing out, avocado, bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato! It was so delish. I wish I knew how to work the picture uploader app so I could show you guys! (My last batch of pics I uploaded disappeared.. No clue where I uploaded them to!) We all hung out outside the place and charged or phones, eagerly waiting in the cold for our hot showers and beds at the Ironmaster's Mansion. Brandon (who's trail name is now Baloo) and I went and checked out the AT museum down the street. It was super cute and informational. I loved all the memorabilia they had from all the famous hikers. The Katahdin mountain sign was pretty cool too.Wee Gillis showed up at the store around 2:30 and I got to watch him work on the half gallon ice cream challenge for 2.5 hours! It was too funny. I wish I could've tried it, but it was way too dang cold out! 5 o'clock finally struck and I dashed to the hostel to check in and get my much needed hot shower!! It was SO amazing to shower for the first time in 8 days. Let me tellll you! I seriously felt and looked like a new woman! Or at least my old, usual pre-trail self. I rushed back down to the general store to order a buffalo chicken wrap before she closed for the night. It was also very good. I took it back up to eat at the hostel bc my laundry was first in and I needed to be there to put it in the dryer right as it finished so all the other hikers could wash their gear too. After dinner, everyone hung around talking. I played card games with 2 other men staying at the hostel that night. Additionally, everyone gave me advice about what to do with my feet, so I can't wait to try it out tomorrow.Before bed, I was able to organize my pack. Throw away all my trash and condense my food bags. I finally got my pack down to prob 30-35 lbs and holy cow, what a difference it makes!!!

Never thought I'd live to see the day that I didn't need 15 alarms to drag myself out of bed in the morning! Guess that's what happens when you start living a life you actually want to live - everyday is exciting!I got all my stuff together that morning and headed downstairs. I wrote my mom and grandma some cards and drank some coffee. I hung out with Baloo until it was our time to eat breakfast at 8am. We had bagels and waffles! After breakfast, Fiber, Baloo and I hit the trail. We hiked together for the first few miles playing the name game by trying to guess each others names. It was pretty entertaining and passed the time. Fiber eventually hiked ahead but we all met up for stretching and snack breaks throughout the day. I took everyone's advice about my feet and today was the best day on them so far!! Frequent breaks throughout the day that include: stretching, elevating my feet, walking in the creeks, wearing less thick socks, loosening my laces, and just giving them downtime truly made a difference! My pack was lighter today too, so I know that really helped them as well. Thank you thank you so much everyone who helped me out! I'm looking forward to going farther distances now on these babies. Later in the evening, we all met up at ""Alec Baldwin"" shelter. When we got there, we had a fire and ate our dinners and just stayed up talking till the sun went down. It was a really beautiful day for hiking and camping was a must when we knew there'd be no rain! Stonecold stayed in his hammock by the shelter, while Wee Gillis, Fiber, Baloo and I camped down the hill. Dark water came through and stayed in the shelter that night too. This night was hard to sleep. It was kind of cold and the train kept coming through the town 4 mi away numerous times that night. I was scared to fall asleep for some reason. Stonecold's murder stories got to me I guess lol no more scary stories at shelters for me! Also the moon was insanely bright and planes kept flying overhead. Not to mention, i set up my tent on moss thinking it'd be soft and cushy. NOPE. lol it was very rocky and uncomfortable. So I didn't sleep well but that was ok bc we were heading to town the next day to sleep in a hotel and hang out at the bar! Yay! Oh yeah and hit my first 100 miles today baby!!!

Well normal me would've loved this, but camping-hiker chick me is incapable of such monstrosities. I watched an episode of American Dad on Netflix before rolling out of my tent at 7:30 am. I got dressed and made breakfast - oatmeal that Fiber gave me and it was so good! He makes the best meals! I know I tend to say that all the food I eat out here is fantabulous.. But it really really is! Even if I wasn't deprived of home cooked meals on the reg. It was cold again this morning and I was craving some fire warmth. I gathered some sticks and had Baloo light a mini one that we enjoyed for about an hour before hitting the trail. The day warmed up and got pretty hot. I think it was just below 80 which is exactly what I needed!! I miss FL weather so much. We hiked through big corn fields and got to see wide open spaces today. It was really nice. Not a cloud in the sky. The spring water at Boiling Springs reminded me of FL. It was so beautifully blue and clear. Tons of ducks and swans out on the water. It went through a lovely park. It was just too cute. We all went and picked up our first resupply boxes at the PO. It was a fun experience. So exciting getting goodies sent from home and you never know what you'll get! We immediately went to the tavern and got some food and alcohol in our system. The food again.. You guessed it, was AMAZING. I got a French onion soup and a Louisiana Caesar Salad. After that I went to the gas station for a red bull and some candy while the boys went to the outfitters across the street. After that we hiked the half mile to the hotel. We relaxed and took hot showers then we met for dinner at the hotel bar. My stomach was hurting all afternoon, so it put a damper on things. I didn't eat much and had a 7up to try and make me feel better. Stonecold was also feeling a bit under the weather. But we stuck it out, played some pool and all had a great time. Fiber and Baloo were hilarious intoxicated entertainment. We all had a great time. Eventually my stomach hurt less after I had a few beers, which was a relief!In my box today I got my sleeping bag liner and I cannot wait to use it! I really hope it keeps me nice and toasty instead of cold and frozee like I have been. Thank you mom SO much! You are the best!It was really nice to sleep in a double bed with my arms and legs stretched out! I have missed sleeping Ina real bed tremendously, but I'm hoping as time goes by, I'll adjust to my mummy style sleeping bag and my paper thin sleeping pad. PS: thank you to everyone who has left messages in my guest book! You guys are so kind! I love the tips and advice. You've been my trail angels so far!!Also, Tom and Nanci: I love you guys! <3 Follow my SNOG for better updates and pics.

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534363,"Woke up feeling so refreshed this morning. I took a hot shower to rinse off just because I could! And also bc I know I'll miss it. Got to drink some fresh brewed coffee, which is great.. But boy do I miss creamer! I packed up my bags and we all hit the trail around 10 am. Today's hike was pretty through green forests, open fields, the middle of farmlands, past cow pastures, and by a pretty river where hundreds of purple and white flowers were all in bloom. Even with the cold rain pouring down, I loved every minute of it. The one setback about the rain is that it's harder to take breaks. You just get cold when you stop and your bag gets wet when you set it down. There were no other shelters between darlington and town so I had to push through and push my feet to the limit. When I finally got here at 3:30pm, they hurt, but not nearly as bad as they used to. I really hope my trail legs are coming in soon! Sadly, my pack is incredibly heavy. It's almost unbearable. With my new food supply, it feels like 50lbs. It hurts my neck and shoulders, and all day today I couldn't really feel my left arm. It was achy at the times that I could feel it. Other than my feet, my most unpleasant feelings are not being able to get relief through stretching. I'm constantly flexing my toes and my hands (esp at night) and trying to stretch out my legs and arms but they still give me that unstretched feeling no matter how many times I do it. I'll be glad when these feelings go away and hiking becomes pure pleasure and bliss. I'm sure they'd go away now if I hiked a little less or had a lighter pack, but sometimes you have no other options but to keep going to the first shelter you can get to. In addition to that, I really like our cuatro trailmigo group we have and it'd be great to stay together. It makes the whole experience much more fun having the companionship every night. I still tend to hike at my own pace during the day, but I do push myself a little more just to keep up with the Georgia boys -fiber and stonecold. At the shelter tonight, I finally met a girl!! Yay! Her name is Wonka. She is pretty cool. She will most likely be way ahead soon since she started in GA too, but it's really nice having another girl around. Funny enough, there's actually at least 4 other girls here tonight but they're camping down the hill. I guess as time passes, the GA folk keep catching up to us and more girls will appEar! Maybe once I get my trail legs I can actually make friends with some of them. I know I'm a dork, but I look forward to that! Now it's super early, but not much to do with no fire to be made. Everyone is just resting in the shelter and passing out early. We're not exactly in a conversational setting lolGuess I'm going to hit the hay. Wish me luck tonight: Fiber's fart butt is right above my head! Lol he is somethin else. Follow my SNOG for better updates and pics. Snapchat username: saylind.vettloThanks for reading!

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535471,"Writing this entry on day 16, so it may not be as detailed.Today was a GREAT day. We flew down the trail. We had 10 miles to town. I believe it was slightly rainy, or on and off. I just remember getting a couple blisters this day. I've learned that when my feet get wet and sweaty, my shoes (being waterproof) take longer to dry which breeds blisters for me! However the blisters didn't bother me much today. There were a lot of downhill trails and I just ran down them. At one point I had a little runner's high. I just felt so good. I knew I could do a big day today and get in at least another 5. There was one good overlook today, but the rain clouds made it hard to see in pictures. (Oh yes! Last night, We were also warned of the green bandana hanging from a tree and the scary man camped next to it who had a gun and a machete.. Apparently he was crazy. We were told not to speak to him and stay far away. We were told of his precise location: through the fields, past the parking lot, after the wood bridge.. He's supposedly camped off in the back. Well, we got there, I see the bandana and fiber starts speeding up. I look around and see nothing and I call his name. He turns around and puts his fingers to his mouth shushing me, I mouth the words, ""im scared!"" Back to him and he turns around and waves his hand at me to come on. I looked to the left where I was told he was and saw nothing but an empty patch of flattened grass but I took a pic of the bandana and ran up to fiber to hike at his pace. I never saw the mans tent, but I was informed later by fiber and Baloo that it was right there 10ft off the trail! stonecold didn't see it either. I looked at least 3x for it! Thankfully, we made it out alive with no close encounters)So, we got to town and ate some awesome BBQ that a hiker (the one that warned us of the man near the green bandana) from the last shelter recommended. I can't believe how much I ate today. I had pulled pork sandwich and 1/3rack of ribs. Ate it all up! It was so good! Then we headed to the infamously famous Hotel and restaurant called The Doyle (the rumors say this place is so crappy that the local crackheads won't even stay here lol). We all had a few beers. Charged up our phones. I was playing music on the juke box when fiber walks up and says, ""sooo what do you think about staying the night?"" I was like omg guys! We said we wouldn't! Lol that's what alcohol will do to you. I was really excited about getting more miles under my belt, but I knew there'd be no convincing them not to stay. So we ordered more rounds and played more songs. Eventually, I went up to take a shower in the god awful bathroom. I made sure not to touch anything and get in and out as much as possible. I used my own towel. Next thing I know I'm drinking from a bottle of even Williams? Idk it looked like knock off Jack D to me, with the guy who repaired the place and ""fixed it up real nice"" -eesh! And Hootie and maybe Big O.. Can't remember who else was with us. They left the room and me in there with the old dude named Indian. We're sitting on my bed and I felt instantly creeped out. Luckily he didn't overstay his welcome and I went back downstairs to join the party. I think we drank so more then headed to the pizza place down the street. Stonecold and I ordered a large pizza. I can't believe we ate allBut a slice and a half! The hiker hunger comes on strong! I played some pool with Obi and Wet Beard, had one more drink then pretty much called it a night. Stonecold and I went back to our room and we watched Game of Thrones. I passed out immediately, and he went out to hang with the boys on the porch. Oh and England and Baloo went to the strip club after the pizza place. Lol they really lived it up!It was a scummy hotel room but it was cheap and I slept SO comfortably. I prob hogged the bed but I don't even care lol. Today was a fun day, im glad we stayed at that crazy place. I enjoyed it despite waking up inches away from black crusty boogers on the wall. :PFollow my SNOG for daily updates and pics. Snapchat username: saylind.vettloThanks for reading!

",The Doyle,"May 22, Sun",11.40
Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535992,"This morning I woke up and packed up my stuff. Stonecold and I went to get some coffees and breakfast at quick mart down the street. First we ran into Baloo whom we hadn't seen since the pizza place. He was all packed up and ready to go. Supposedly, the guys described the strippers as ""poor people begging for money"". Haha too sad. So I had a snickers ice-cream bar for breakfast and 20oz coffee. Yum! We sat in the sun on the porch and talked to whoever walked by as we ate our breakfast. Met a man from Alabama but I forget his name. Eventually, Fiber, Stonecold, and I hit the road around 10:15. It was a decent day, but everyone was hungover of course. We were all moving slow. I felt fine, but not 100%. We crossed a huge bridge out of town. Bugs were swarming all of us. That was gross but it was a pretty view of the town and the mountains. We got to the hill and started hiking our way up! We stopped at the first shelter to break and snack. It was loaded with cats pillars, wasps, and bumblebees. All day today the inch worms hanging from the trees mummified us in their silk. Fiber eventually passed us and I hiked slowly with Stonecold. He was feeling crappy and I was doing my best to walk and not aggravate my blisters any further. We made it to the footbridge 2.8 miles away from the shelter and took a break. We could see the rain clouds coming in and the wind began to pick up. We put on our pack covers and began hiking to the shelter quickly. We got to the top of the mountain and were hiking the ridge out in the open when the thunder began to roll in. It quickly began to pour and we distanced ourselves from each other. I ran as fast as I could. The Lightning was flashing and the thunder was loud. My blisters starting burning and the skin on my heels started to rub on my shoes and peel off my skin. The tree branches were falling from the trees 10 ft in front of me, crashing to the ground. I screamed and stopped and prayed it wouldn't hit me and kept jogging on. I prayed aloud the majority of the way to the shelter. The thunder and lightening finally slowed down and I slowed down too. I was drenched and sore. Stonecold passed me and I walked the remaining mile and a half as slow as possible. The drops turned into drizzles and I began to freeze. Every step I took burned. I could feel 10 different spots on each foot rubbing my shoes and creating more blisters. Just when they were beginning to heal, 20 minutes of rain multiplied it all.I finally reached the shelter and dumped my pack. It was full of all my friends, but I was purely miserable. (Even writing this now, my left heel is throbbing lol)I could hardly walk. I was limping around. I put my flip flops on immediately, like I always do. I ate some dinner, then crawled up into the loft to do the worst part of the whole process- clean my wounds. I peeled the tape of my blisters slowly, wincing from the pain. I bit down on a clean pair of socks and used an alcohol wipe to clean them up. The burn was excruciating. I wanted to grasp on to something so bad. Biting down didn't help, I just wanted to cry out. Next was the neosporin spray. Didn't think it would hurt, but it stung just as badly. I let my feet air out. It hurt to let my heels wrinkle. Every time I moved my feet I was in pain. I went and put my food bag away then I came back upstairs in the loft ready to relax.Stonecold and I watched the GOT episode I fell asleep trying to watch the other night. I had to lay on my stomach and keep my heels at a 90 degree angle in order to endure the pain. After that episode my skin finally gooed itself together and I was able to lay on my back. But I kept my feet out of my sleeping bag so it would get fresh air. We watched the latest episode of GOT and it was SO good!! Poor Hodor.  then we went straight to sleep.I slept ok, but my feet would hurt every now and then. Today was a scary but exciting day. Wish I wasn't in pain, it's been pretty brutal.","The Doyle

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535993,"Today was a big miles day. We all planned to do 18 the day before. I woke up this morning not even wanting to walk. I knew today was going to be absolutely terrible. I cleaned my blisters and taped them up first thing. I knew I didn't want to do any excess walking. I loaded my pack and hobbled down the steps and around the shelter to get my food bag from the bear box. I could feel my skin separating and reopening my wounds on both my heels. It was so awful. What hurt even more was putting on my wet socks and then shoving my swollen, blistered feet into my wet shoes. I thought today was going to be unbearable, but to my surprise, my feet didn't rub as badly as I expected they would. I said bye to the boys and ate a pop tart on my way out. I limped the entire day, but I pushed through. Baloo passed by me shortly, then Hootie was the second to pass me. He always has a smile on his face and is in the best mood. I love that about him.. Can't wait for that to be me again once my pain is gone! He is just a ray of sunshine that rubs off on everyone.. And not the annoying kind haha. Everyone else eventually followed suit in passing me. I did get to see a deer close up today. She didn't run away and I was able to take a few pictures. Later I passed the boys trying to catch fish with some line the untangled from a tree. I heard later on that Hootie actually caught one! That's pretty cool. I hiked on, knowing that I needed to go if I wanted to make it to Rausch by dark. I was in so much pain from my feet, moving very slowly, walking uphill and completely out of breath when a man -possibly by the name double digits- passed me. He tried to talk to me, but I just couldn't keep up a conversation. I was kind of rude to him and I felt really bad, I hope to see him in the future so I can apologize. I just never considered myself a strong person. Im such a baby, I'm scared of everything, my pain tolerance is so low. When I'm going through stuff, I'm really going through it! My emotions are always written on my face and I can't fake anything.. I just am in the mood I'm in when I'm in the mood I'm in. So if I feel defeated, I'm not acting super positive and am happy about the future. I feel everything intensely and I sit through it. I knew I'd make it through today, but that didn't make me feel any better in the moment I was in. That's just how I am. So I feel bad that I wasn't my usual bubbly, talkative self when that man passed me by. Hopefully I can make up for it in the future!Anyways, shortly after he passed me I came across a ginormous timber rattle snake!! It had about 6-7 rattles, it was mainly all black with very light, almost faded gray diamonds. I was on the phone with my sister when it Happened and my immediate thought was ""omg it's a rattlesnake!"" I told her it has the tail like a rattler, with the rings and all. But she didn't understand the way I described it and she said it might not be one. I got off the phone with her so I could take a pic before it slithered away. The snake just sat there. It didn't move its tail, it didn't coil up. It just stared at me and didn't move. I took a couple videos and some pictures. Looking back, I was probably way too close to this deadly snake. But it was so chill and not aggravated or in defense mode so I thought it might not be a rattler. We all decided later it was. I wanna say it was 3 or 4 ft long. And pretty thick around. Maybe it had just eaten and that's why it was just chillin. I've never seen a snake out in the wild that big before, but I keep hearing rumors and seeing other people's videos so I know bigger and scarier is still up ahead!I stopped for lunch at a little creek. I took off my shoes and propped up my feet. Trying to ease the pain. I was shocked at how far I had come with how insanely painful my foot problem was last night and that morning. I hung out for about 45 min then I hit the trail. The trail began to get boring and I couldn't listen to music in order to preserve my battery, so I began to sing the 99 bottles of beer song. (By the end of the day, I had sung it 3x. )About 5 miles away from the campsite, Obi comes walking up. He slowed down and hung out with me and we talked and walked together. On one of our breaks, I spoke without thinking and I asked him if there were any other guys on the trail like him and Wet Beard. I immediately regretting saying it and he didn't understand what I meant by that. I didn't even understand what exactly I meant by that at the time. He's just this certain type of person that I expected before coming out here. Luckily, we worked through the awkward moment and moved on from the topic. I never was able to give him an explanation. We hung out for a couple miles, but he left me with about 2 miles left. Me being me, I dwelled on my idiotic comment for the last 4 miles of the trail (which felt incredibly long since I had never hiked that far in my life with a pack and blistered feet). I kept repeating my stupidity over and over in my head, trying to understand what the heck I meant by it. It occurred to me finally, that it's mainly his familiarity. He's the first person I've come across that's been in the military, and he also reminds me a little bit of my guy friend who did the trail and told me all about the AT. The people out here are much more diverse than I expected, not like I expected there to be only dark haired, bearded, military dudes out here; I didn't even consciously realize that I stereotyped the trail to having a common type of person out here. Either way, what it boils down to is his company and familiar-ness. It's crazy how when you're away from your friends and family for so long that when people remind you of home, it just gives you a comforting feeling. Makes you feel more safe. When I finally reached my explanation, I tried to be easy on myself for the rest of the day; relax a little bit, but the thoughts steadily churned in my mind for the next 2 days.Moving on, I walked and I walked and I walked. To the point you feel like your feet will fall off, or you just want someone to chop them off. I got down a hill and saw a dark something. I rejoiced hoping it was the shelter, but sadly it wasn't. I couldn't take it anymore. I pulled of my shoes and put on my flip flops. I tucked my socks in my shoes and I held them with my fingers and my trekking poles. I whimpered and hobbled, whimpered and hobbled. I got farther down the hill and the view was so nice. The water rushed by, there were a couple water falls, then a nice big camp ground appeared and I saw England! He told me the shelter was .3 up the hill. I was glad to know, but still devastated about going .3 more. I almost gave up and camped right there with him, but he likes his privacy and I wanted to see my group. I eventually made it there and I couldn't have been happier to see all my friends sitting around the campfire. We all hung out and talked, my big smile quickly returned. It felt so good to be with everyone. A little later, a girl named Toothpick joined us. She's really cool. Tonight I had to hang my food from a tree, which was awful. There were zero low branches and the ones that were low, were on a steep hill. It was not easy, thankfully Fiber helped me a great deal. I had to chase after my shoe that went rolling down a ways, then climb with my hands, knees and feet just to get back up. Not fun after a grueling day. I made it through, as always. It was a really lovely campsite. Very pretty and picturesque. I fell asleep very shortly after I got in my tent. Follow my SNOG for daily updates and pics.

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535994,"Today was a rough day. I was in so much pain from my feet. I stopped frequently to give them breaks, but it still wasn't enough. By the end of the day I was stopping every 15-20 min. Praying for the shelter to be around the corner soon. Today was supposed to be easy. I changed my mind on sticking with the group and opted for only 12 miles so I wouldn't injure myself, and it felt rougher than yesterday's 18! At some points it got really hot out. I ran out of water and everything.My first 3 miles I cried the entire time. I figured it was just emo-girly me finally breaking out, telling me it's time to go home to suburbia where I belong. I fought through it. I cried it out and pushed on through the pain and the dirt and the smell. I kept walking and climbing over every fallen tree in my path. The loneliness crept in deeper and deeper. Making me miss my ex, my family, my friends, and even my trail buds. Today I miss hot showers, a comfy bed, home cooked meals, and laying around the house being lazy just because I can. I worked through all that this morning, and I tried to let the smell of fresh flowers, green grass, and fallen leaves and pine needles whisk away my sadness. It was such a beautiful day today. It always is out here to me, even when it rains. The sunshine takes everything up a notch. I got to my lunch spot near a small creek and enjoyed it for all it was worth. I took my time, savor my meal, let my socks dry in the sun while I soaked my swollen feet in the water. I sat there for at least an hour before returning to the trail. It felt good to ""hike my own hike"" again. I knew I had plenty of time to make it to the next shelter. So I didn't rush, whenever I needed a break, I took it. I felt so much better after lunch. The pain just never went away from my feet though. I was also feeling more tired than normal. The inclines today were small but had me way out of breath. I blamed it on the heat, but it was probably from hiking the 18 miles yesterday.Even with how rough today was, I finally made it through. I made it past the pain and the tears and I got here. I didn't give up and I don't plan to quit, so either way I am proud of myself.Now to the good part: Today was a nature exhibit day! The flowers smelled so perfume sweet, it was really nice. I saw tons of chipmunks, some chunky squirrels, and birds- of course. I saw a small black and yellow snake - Yikes. Then I saw a pretty decent sized black snake about 15 min later. I think snakes are super cool creatures. I'm surprised I'm not as scared of them as I should be. Im sure I will be eventually, once I have a scary close encounter. Idk why yesterday's snake encounter wasn't as alarming as it should've been. Prob because I wasn't 100% sure it was a rattlesnake at the time, even though it was my first thought.I also saw a momma bird call her baby birds when I scared her. It was super cute. The little babies ran and flew over to her and they all strutted along through the forest. I need to look up the bird when I get to town. It was reddish brown and it liked to walk through the leaves more so than fly. Reminded me of a chicken, may have been a quail but I don't think so. I got to see its body pretty clearly before it scuttled away, so I think I'll be able to figure out what it was easily. I also saw 2 bunnies today. The one I have a pic on snapchat might be a hare. But the one I saw walking down to the shelter was definitely a wee little brown bunbun.Lastly, I collapsed on the shelter floor and was eating a snack when a little head poked up from the cracks of wood. It was a mouse! Omg it was so stinking cute! It stared at me and I even got a picture but the pic erased when I got a text message. It was so adorable. I've heard SO much about the mice in the shelters; how they're everywhere and will run across your face and everything. Idk why I was picturing white mice this whole time. This little brown one was just the cutest. I'm sure I say this now and I'll go to sleep tonight and have them swarm me, or tear apart my bag and eat my food and chew holes in everything. Let's hope that's not the case though! I want to love them as much tomorrow as I do tonight.So like I said, exciting but tough day! Hopefully tomorrow will be alright. Doesn't look like I'll be getting to Port Clinton by the time my group leaves. This is sad, but I'll make new friends, which is exciting!This is the first night im alone in a shelter by myself. Theres about 5 other people in this approximate area though. So if anything terrible happens, hopefully they'll come save me! LolFollow my SNOG for daily updates and pics.

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536324,"I made it through the night at the shelter. No mice or bears bothered me, or my food. I slept pretty decently. My heel continues to split open every morning. I have to clean it up with alcohol wipes and apply neosporin and all my blister wrappings. The amount of blister tape keeps increasing. I basically need to just tape up my entire foot at this point.I think I ate a pop tart for breakfast, then I separated my lunch and granola bars from my food bag to places in my pack for easy access. I hiked up the hill and over the AT trail and back down to much needed water. As I filled my camelbak, a surprise visitor came down for water. I couldn't believe it, it was England!! He was apparently hurting too and ready for a break. He said he camped nearby last night and was headed 2 miles up the road and was going to hitch into town and take the day off. I was super jealous but happy that he made that choice. We parted ways and off I hiked.The first 2 miles went by quickly, the second 2 not so much. By the 3rd mile, I reached a clearing in the trees with a gorgeous view. It was an open grassy field similar to ones where power lines run through, but there weren't any there. I dropped my pack, kicked off my shoes and socks then I walked down to the edge of the hill and sat in the sun, loving the view. I watched horses run around on a farm down below. I snacked on some trail mix, and I tried to relax and forget about my feet pain. The sun feels so good out here. It reminds me of home. I let my skin soak up the vitamin D that I've been needing since I left Florida. After about 30 min I got up and continued on to the shelter. Shortly, Perry and his dog, Mika, joined me on the trail and we walked there together. It was probably only .5 mile away. 501 shelter was very interesting. It looked like a great hangout place. Toothpick was there devouring pizzas with the group of people I ran into on the trail the night before. We all chatted a bit and I fought my urges to buy any food while I had so much weighing me down in my pack. I decided to shower first. It was an outdoor shower with a hose connected to barrels of water above my head. It was chilly! I used the gross soap bars left behind by other hikers - something I'd never be caught dead doing back in my old life. I tried to scrub off the top layers all around it first in the very least. I also chose the least hairiest bar of soap there was. LolI rinsed, then bathed, then rinsed. Then I just flipped my hair and rinsed it out. No shampoo or conditioner left behind for me unfortunately. I got dressed and headed back into the shelter. Still resisting my urge to splurge, I cooked some chicken noodle soup and ate it really slowly. Perry brought up buying pizza and before I knew it, I ordered a small one and garlic knots all to myself. I thought it was a terrible decision at the time, but in fact, it was JUST what my body needed. That and a long break. I stayed at 501 for about 3.5 hours. I knew I wanted to hike on to lessen my miles for the next day, but I was too scared to tent alone my first time. Thankfully, 2 new hikers came in: Dutch and Clean Skittles. They said they were also hiking on and I tried to get them to promise me they'd only go to the next campsite and no farther bc I was too! They left after eating a larger pizza each and went off to the campsite to find the rumored reservoir that they could fish in. I hung out at the shelter organizing my stuff, elevating my legs and chatting with Toothpick. She was zeroing there and I was really tempted to too, but I didn't want my group to get too much farther ahead. I really missed them. Especially once I heard about the huge party everyone had together in the 501 the night before. It was a big bummer that I missed out. Also, I must mention that while talking to Toothpick, I brought up my idiotic question I prompted Obi with the day before, you know the one that was tearing me to shreds, and I'm SO glad I did. She knew exactly where I was coming from, and without explanation, knew exactly what I meant and even felt the same way! It was so ironic and funny at the same time. I couldn't believe it. My anxiety level went from a 9 to a 4 after talking with her. I was so happy!!So I finally forced myself to pack up and hit the trail after my pizza digested. The elevation of my feet didn't help much, I haven't been able to see my ankle bones in idk how long, at least a week and a half. It was the best I could do for now.What I immediately noticed while hiking my last 5 miles, was how unbelievably great I felt! I could pretty much walk, run, and hop rocks as if it was day 1! Yes, it still hurt my feet, but I just had this groove and I went with it. Those were the fastest and easiest 5 miles id hiked since the beginning. I was so down and so low lately, it was insane how great I felt in those moments. They all kept saying what a morale booster pizza was, and oh how correct they were! I am so thankful I ordered that pizza. It got me through my evening.To top it all off when I got down to the campsite, the boys were there tenting, which made me really happy. AND the reservoir was so cool! It had a waterfall and a rope swing. You could swim in it! It was super neat and we had it all to ourselves. It was just so beautiful and one of my favorite places on the trail. I swam a little bit.. It was ICE cold. SO chilly. I couldn't go past my waste, I thought I was going to get frostbite. I did keep my feet soaked till they went numb and I washed my socks and shirt in the water. I was pleased with my decision to leave the 501 shelter and I fell asleep to the sounds of peaceful waterfall in the background that night. Follow my SNOG for daily updates and pics.

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536457,"What a day, what a day. I woke up at the Reservoir. It rained a little over night, but had stopped by the morning. My tent was damp, but not as bad as my first time tenting in the rain my first nights out on the trail. It also wasn't ridiculously heavy from the water like it had been the time before.
It always hurts taking those first steps out of my tent. Feeling my skin separating on my heel. I'm getting a tad used to it, but not enough. My feet look the worst out of anyone's I've seen out here. It's pretty disgusting. I'll probably be banned from wearing flip flops in FL ever again after this trip! Haha and for good reasons too. So I have this awkward struggle standing up and pulling myself out of my tent every morning. I have to get my hands on the ground in front of me, and shift my weight on to my right foot (which is apparently unnatural for me?), then I press my weight on my right foot and pull myself out of my tent with my hands on the ground; all this to try and put as little pressure on my left foot with my bad heel. Most times I fall at least twice before managing to get out of my tent. Additionally, it's such a struggle to get it every morning, it's like I always seem to pitch my tent where there's a slight uphill from my tent door or something. You get it though: the struggle is real! 
After I got out of my tent, I practically hop on my right foot to get to my food bag. My heel split in the process of course. It takes about 10 min each morning before I can walk on it almost normally. The time decreases with each passing day, thankfully, which means healing heels! I grabbed my food bag and about 10 millipedes had slept on top of it to hide from the rain last night. They all came flying off in my face as I pulled it down- gross.
I can't remember every minute detail of this morning, as it was so long ago, but I know that both the boys packed their stuff in about 5 minutes and were on their way. My jaw practically hit the dirt. My morning routine is at least an hour long. I didn't even cook breakfast this morning. Oh well, so I'm astonished and jealous, while pitifully cleaning and wrapping my feet up. I have run out of practically all my blister products so I decided not to over tape today and pray that the toes that were first to blister have calloused enough to be tape free.
Today was an 18 miler to get to town tonight. I wasn't originally going to push tonight, and I was going to get as far as my feet would take me. However, I was reminded at 501 that Monday is a holiday and that Port Clinton had very short Saturday hours. I wasn't going to risk not waking up early enough to get there on Saturday, therefore, I knew I needed to push through today as best as I could in order to get there tonight. It was good to get there tonight because my friends would all still be there too. Reunion- yay!
I stopped for a break at Eagle's Nest. I believe it was around 1 or 2 pm. My feet were throbbing, I needed a break so badly. The shelter was an awful .3 miles off the trail, which was excruciating at that point. I could only make it to the spring before I kicked off my shoes and blister tapes and dropped my pack. I couldn't make it to the shelter, another .1 was just too far at that time. I put my feet in the water and tried to get my stuff out of the path of the trail. Then I practically crawled up the hill to where the water was actually running, I got out my jerky and my mat and I laid with my feet on my pack and my head almost right next to the spring. Looking back, it was probably a little rude of me to be so close to the spring. I mean my hair wasn't touching it close, but it was a few feet from my head. I was just purely exhausted. I ate my beef jerky laying down and a man came over to fill his bottles. He swore I was ok. I tried to back a little bit more away from the spring for him too. Thankfully, he was the only person who got water while I was there that I know of. I fell asleep for about an hour after I finished my jerky.
I woke up and rolled over to find toothpick down at the bottom of the water, soaking her feet. We chatted a bit while I relentlessly packed up my stuff and got out of everyone's way. My own personal joke out here is that I'm such a frat boy. I get to places and I'm always so exhausted that I plop down and end up leaving a trail of my stuff in -or near- everyone's way. I always try to go back and get it (like my trekking poles for sure) but sometimes other people get to them for me. I feel terrible! And it is SO unlike me. I clean houses for a living at home; I'm a total clean freak and am constantly organizing stuff. So it's crazy how I am like this out here. I do work on fixing it daily. (For the record: in real time, I'm on day 24: I've become MUCH better at keeping my crap out of everyone's way now. Haha go me!)
So I hiked on to Port Clinton. I don't remember much, except that the downhill into PC was serious! It was even more seriously painful being my 17th mile of the day with swollen, aching feet. Luckily, I was able to listen to music, knowing I was about to be in town and could charge my phone. Taylor Swift's Blank Space song really turned the pain into progress for me right as it came on. It made me think of Big O and how he loves this song. He said it's a power song for him too. I let a big smile stretch across my face and I belted out the lyrics as I powered down the rocky slope. I was instantly happier and excited to get to town. I told myself that I was closer and closer with each hammering step.
Once I got down the mountain, I walked through an old train station. It was so cute. I missed the pretty green train that left right as I got down, but I got a nice picture of a red one. I walked across the bridge and in to town and my friends called me up and told me how to get to the pavilion.
Stonecold met me outside and we walked there together. He told me about this guy named Bag of Tricks and all the amazing things he's going to do for us and the hikers. He even offered to give me a ride to the pavilion, but I was half way there and decided to walk. It hurt very badly. It was actually not my choice to continue walking lol. I wanted a wheel chair to descend from heaven at that moment.
I got to the pRavilion (as Obi likes to call it), I set up my tent and elevated my feet. Tricks had Stonecold go get me an ice cold Gatorade from his cooler in his truck. They offered me snacks too; I was just so happy to be done walking and back with my friends. I hung out with Obi, Wet Beard and Hootie while I let my feet rest, then Obi, Wet Beard and I, went to get dinner at the bar. I brought up the scenario one last time to Obi bc I just *had* to let him know I wasn't crazy and that Toothpick was on the same wavelength as me. It didn't make a difference. Haha he still didn't know what I meant, but I was officially able to let it go and now I've got my peace of mind back -that's all that matters to me! 
After dinner, we bought some beers and went back and hung out at the PRavilion. Everyone was in bed by then, since they all partied hard the night before. So me, Obi, Baloo, and Tricks went across the street to a picnic table and laughed and talked for a good couple hours. 
It was a nice night in town. I was so proud of myself that I made it to PC, all 18 miles, all by myself. The beers were a great way to relax and celebrate. Being back with friends was the cherry on top! I slept well this night.

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536623,"This morning we got up later than usual. Bag of Tricks offered to slack pack all our bags to Eckville today because it was only 10 minutes up the road for him. He even gave out light backpacks for people to use. I thought my Osprey turned into a small day pack, if it does, I couldn't figure it out. My heel is finally starting to get better, but I still have my morning limp. It oozes, then I clean it and seal it. It's become an easy routine now. My morning was off to a terrible start, Tricks offered to take me to the post office so I didn't have to walk and when I got there, none of my packages were there. I was devastated. I thought I might starve, my whole trail family had zeroed in town the day before and had everything taken care of already. My only option was to stay back behind again or hope I could spread out my 1 day supply of food over 3, where the next resupply would be. I was so upset, I was fighting back the tears. I just dropped off excess food at the 501 shelter the day before, that I could've used now. I had pushed myself so hard to get into town to be able to pick up my mail, just to find it wasn't there. I was so worried and I kept trying to tell myself it would all work out.Not only did not having my food suck, but my thin running socks I ordered off Amazon weren't there either. I had just boxed up my old socks and gave them to the mail lady to ship off. I could've got them back, but I knew everyone was waiting on me back at the pavilion. Luckily, Fiber gave me some granola bars and Green Hornet had left behind a shrimp ramen in the hiker box. I grabbed it and we all headed out. I called Amazon on the way out of town and there was nothing they could do for me. They were only able to refund my order. The lady at the post office isn't allowed to open my mail, so the only thing she could do was send it back to Amazon. It was a tough situation, down to one stinky, dirty pair of socks and no way to tell when I'll have more. The sock situation bothered me more than being almost out of food. There was nothing I could do about it and I knew the situation was out of my control. It was hard but our first stop of the day definitely cheered me up. We went about a mile out of PC and went to a local spot called Peace Rock. It was a swimming area with a huge graffiti'd rock across the way. Probably had a 30-40ft jump at the top, with a smaller 15-20ft jump at the bottom. We were all so happy to get to swim in the water. Especially water that wasn't bitterly cold. It really helped to take my mind off my situation. I wasn't going to swim across the way and jump off the rocks with my feet in the condition they were in, so I was perfectly content floating on my back in my sports bra and shorts, while I watched the locals jump.After about an hour, we all had to get back to hiking to Eckville. None of us were ready to leave, but no one had their packs, so we had to keep going. It was so late, about 1pm when we hit the trail. Hiking without a 40lb pack was phenomenal. It was nice to feel like a day hiker again. Sadly, I was starting to get hungry. In addition to the hunger pains, I was tired and not at 100% from drinking the night before. So the hike was easy, but not easy enough lol. It was a super busy weekend with the locals. So my group and I (minus Fiber) decided to blue blaze on a trail Tricks told us about. So I'm officially a section hiker! Dun. Dun. Dunnnnn. Lol We skipped 5 miles of the trail and bypassed the Pinnacle view. The book listed it as the best view in PA, I think. I don't see how that's possible after the view I got to see a few days later though, guess I'll never know till I go back and hike it!We got to Eckville Shelter, it was really nice. There was a shower inside a shed AND a flushing toilet. We actually bunked in a shed basically. It was just the 6 (another trail guy who crosses our path was with us today and tomorrow- his name is Babbit) of us and the dog Jack. (Oh yes, Alice and Jack has joined our group today too -they are awesome!)Follow my SNOG for daily updates and pics. Snapchat username: saylind.vettloRemember who you are.","The pRavilion

Mufasa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536624,"By the time everyone went to bed last night, there were multiple snores. I had a hard time sleeping. Bugs were all over me. I almost packed up my stuff and tented, but I didn't want to disturb anyone. I got eaten alive by mosquitos. Also, my feet were so achy last night. I woke up at 4am and couldn't fall back asleep. I came outside and looked at the stars for a little bit and went to the bathroom. I stretched my legs and tried to ease the pain. I tried to go back to sleep, and I may have for a little bit, but I was up again at 5 am. It was really nice out at that hour. Practically every bird sings their morning songs at 5am. There were so many chirps and tweets. It was really lovely. I stretched again and waited for day light to start breaking. Then I slowly gathered my stuff, one by one, out of the shelter and I cooked my breakfast on the picnic table outside. Eventually, I asked Alice if she wanted to get up, and she did. (The night before we discussed getting an earlier start on our days bc it was getting so hot and Jack has a thick fur coat.)Alice and I got a head start from the group and we really enjoyed our morning walk. The only bad part about morning hiking is the hundreds of spiderwebs and silk worm strings you walk through. Once you're mummified, you don't even bother wiping the webs off anymore. We came to our first pretty view, and the man that was sitting there enjoying it, told us we were looking at The Pinnacle view straight across from us. I felt so far away, I can't believe we just hiked that mountain the day before. Even though we didn't actually do Pinnacle, we still hiked all over that whole mountain and it's really cool to see all your hard work right there in front of your face. It's a really good way to feel proud of one's accomplishments. Our group stopped at the Allentown Hiking Club shelter and discovered there was a restaurant on the way to our next shelter, so we decided to stop there for food and drinks. I had no choice anyway, I had to stop for lunch since I was quickly running out of food.About a mile away from the restaurant, I was drained of all energy. I needed food so badly. It was so hard to hike on an empty stomach, with no energy, and foot pains, and my back and shoulders aching. It was a long mile. Right when I got to the restaurant, I did my usual routine. I couldn't take my shoes, socks and pack off fast enough. Man my feet stink so bad. Baloo smelled me right when I walked inside the bar. You'd think out here you could let go of the self-consciousness about how badly you smell, because everyone here does, but nope! There's degrees of smelliness out here and I used to rag on Fiber for smelling so bad, well, I'm right up there with him now! I had to go straight to the bathroom to soap up my legs and feet just to feel comfortable enough to sit at the bar next to my, also stinky, friends. The food at this place was way overpriced, but it was all super delicious. I got an appetizer with fried wontons, Cajun shrimp, and something else. It was amazing wontons and probably the best shrimp I've ever had! Next I got my kids ham and cheese. It was a way bigger portion than I expected and I got fries, which the other guys had to pay extra for fries or they got chips. I was so lucky! Not to mention, the 2 blue moons with orange slices were just what I needed. While we were at the restaurant, the boys were craving cigarettes and they were also working hard to get me a ride to the gas station to resupply. The owner was no help, but a hiker overheard the boys and offered to take me down the street to get to town. I couldn't believe it! I was incredibly grateful for his kindness. He waited for me to get all my food and everything. He was really nice and understanding. My first hitchhiking experience was a success! At the gas station, I bought 3 days worth of food and spent $75!! I definitely made the right decision to buy my food in advance and have it shipped. Yes, there's been mishaps with the shipping, but when I get my boxes, it's worth it. Now I have food till the next town, I won't starve, and things were beginning to look up. We all still had a ways to go before reaching our final destination. Hitting the trail, each step closer to the much anticipated ""Knife's Edge"" rock climb. It was a scary ridge line rock path that went straight down on both sides. It was a bit scary at the time, but looking back, not so bad. The whole group was together and we ""woooed"" out loud when we walked across the ridge. It was a small moment compared to what's to come.After knifes edge, we came to a blue blaze on top of a bunch of rocks. We all dropped out packs and decided to climb up on top. It was a really pretty view and we got another group shot together. This time with Alice and Jack Our shelter was roughly 2.5 more miles after Knifes Edge, but it was full of rocks. Boulder hopping. Sore feet. It hurt really bad. Not just me, but Alice too. It was good to know I wasn't the only wuss in excruciating pain for once. We made it through together. Then we went down to get much needed water from the stream. Of course it was waaay far down hill. I was slipping in my flip flops, we had to use our headlamps to see at this point. Alice and I sat and talked while we slowly filled our waters. When we got back to the top, we did funny yoga stretches. Of course the boys loved it, but my body loved it more. My favorite was laying with my knees at my ears. Ah it was perfect. I'm pretty sure I was too tired to eat dinner this night. We all crammed in tight into Bake Oven Knob Shelter. 6 people and 1 dog. It was the tightest squeeze in a shelter thus far for me. Thankfully, it was with all my favorite people. Apparently people had seen snakes, a bear, mice, and a porcupine at this shelter on previous nights. The porcupine is a fan of gnawing on the shelter wood all night lol. Guess we got lucky and the rain kept all the critters away from us. I slept snug as a bug. Happy to be off my feet.Follow my SNOG for daily updates and pics.
