Lambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512947,"So here goes nothing. Im going to do the AT in 2016 or die trying. As soon as I can figure out when I can leave and where im leaving from. OK perhaps its time for some back story. Ive been in the army for almost 6 years. Multiple duty stations and a combat deployment to Afganistan. Well those 6 years have caught up to me and now im getting medically retired from the army. So during this whole process I have no clue exactly when I will be getting out of the Army. It looks like it will be between February and June of next year. A rather large margin that makes planning a bit difficult. I have pretty much all ready decided that im probably not doing a nobo. So the obvious choice would be a sobo right? Yes and no, although that is currently what im trying to plan for. I have another option, a flip flop of sorts but not in any way a traditional flip flop. Time for more background. I grew up just east of Knoxville, TN. As in right in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. So a flip flop idea I have been toying with has been starting out at Clingmans Dome for a grand send off by friends and family and heading either south or north, depending on when I can head out, finishing that direction, flopping all the way to the other trail end and hiking back to Clingmans Dome to finish with what once again would be a grand time with friends and family. The only problem would be the lack of trail angel support as my time schedual would be very different than anyone else on the trail, unless I can start off from Clingmans Dome in a north bound direction at around the time the nobos are heading through there. This will have given the crowd time to thin out of the people that drop early and there should be some spreading of the crowd as well. Only time will tell how this trip goes. Time to buy some new gear.","

Lambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512952,"So the age old question that everyone has to answer when they say they are going to thru hike. WHY? Well for me it is simple and at the same time very complicated. The simple side is I grew up in the smokeys, love backpacking, almost did this about 6-7 years ago, and because its going to be awesome. Now the more complex side of things, as mentioned before Im currently serving in the army, and getting medically retired in the next 4-6 months. I also mentioned that I did a combat tour in Afganistan, and I am infantry. Well there is certain baggage that comes along with something like that, commonly known as PTSD. I wont go into details or dramatics but I have found that the best therapy for this is nature. Its really the only time I can truly calm down and not be on edge. Also im going to be overcoming some physical injuries. I have a condition in both of my hips that prevent full range of motion and can become rather painful at times and a pretty messed up lower back. But I cannot allow myself to just sit after the army. Yes this trip will be painful but so is everyday life for me. At least Ill have a beautiful backdrop to look at instead of walls.","

Lambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512954,"Once again a little more on my motivations for doing this trip, plus I need 3 journal entries to get this thing up and out to the masses. Ive been searching for something since I got back from deployment, I think I finally found out what that is. HOME. You would think its a simple thing to find and a pretty easy to define ideal but for me it isn't. I honestly cant remember the last time I had a feeling of home. IN the military for don't have home. You have a place you live, but when you are moving every couple of years its hard to really develop a sense of home. Also with every visit to where used to be home, it feels less and less like home. You change, everyone else changes, the place changes. After a while you start to become lost. Im lost. Also leaving the army will be a huge life change for me. I need to figure out who I am outside of the life ive known. So this journey is going to be a search: for who I am, for home, and for what is truly important to me.","

Lambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513055,"So im trying to really cement my plans in my head which means picking a direction. I really think a nobo isn't really probable for me since I have no definite time of when I will be out of the army and a free man. My crazy flip flop I was thinking of would be cool, but I feel would end up turning out to be a huge pain in the ass. So sobo it is... But there is more to the story. Ive decided that the 2000+ miles of the AT isn't long enough of a trip and I will still need to get back to TN after I finish in GA. So in addition to SOBO hiking the AT I also plan to tack on a NOBO hike of the Benton Mackay trail. Am I crazy?    obviously Why would you do this? why wouldn't ISo here's to the AT plus some, Anyone care to join?","

Lambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513237,"Ugh...    I hate sitting at a computer all day. Dont get me wrong im being very productive, reading trail journals, researching gear, and the sort, but I just want to be putting one foot in front of the other allready. I need the freedom, the space, to be out of the mind and soul crushing place I find myself in life right now. Im not sure I have more to put onto this post or what the point of it was. Maybe I just needed to vent. Maybe thats what all of this is about. Come to think about it I think thats what this whole journey will be. A true venting of everything, letting all the past dissapointments and disasters disapear and find whatever it is that im looking for.","

Lambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515882,"The more time im stuck in limbo waiting for all my paperwork to be out of the army the harder everyday gets. I see the light at the end of the tunnel but it doesn't seem to be getting any closer. Also the complete lack of fall in southern California drives me nuts. Its the middle of October and still 90+ degrees everyday. Sorry for the rant, im just ready to have the earth under my feet and my life on my back.","

Lambo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517888,"Plans just got crazy if I can work it out. So a person I look up to very much is starting a SOBO hike today. Yes you read that right someone is doing a winter SOBO. Who that man is you might ask, the one and only The Real Hiking Viking. I have wanted to meet this man for a while now and the time tables are starting to align. The plan, if I can work out the details is to hopfully meet up with him when he reaches the north end of the smokey mountain national park and finish his southbound journey with him. At which point either NOBO the Benton mackay like planned, then once I reach my start point continue on NOBO, or jump up to the top and sobo back to my starting point again. Or once I get to the southern terminus it should be roughly NOBO season and just go north with the other NOBOs. So many options, all of which are a little crazy, but sometimes crazy feels right.","
