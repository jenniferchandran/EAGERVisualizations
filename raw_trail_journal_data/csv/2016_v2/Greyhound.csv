Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520826,"If I sat here and tried to write down everything that I'm feeling right now, you'd either rapidly lose interest, or you'd be concerned for my well being out there on the trail. Every spring, I regret not joining the crowds of future thru hikers in GA. Every summer, as those crowds surge through my home here in the Berkshire hills, I regret not being part of the adventure. No more regrets, no more wishing. This winter, I train for what will surely be my biggest challenge to date- and I welcome it.This is for my family as they nervously wait in the wings for my departure. This for my friends whose enthusiasm has fueled my trip. The energy from both parties has allowed me to dream, and I thank you all for being there for me. This trip is the gateway to whatever this world has in store for me.Come here to find all of the stories you expect, and the ones you don't.",,Work,"Feb 07, Sun",0

This is where you'll tune in to hear me rant, gloat and surely entertain. I have begun the process of giving out this link to all of my friends and family out there in this big wide world of Western Massachusetts. Shout out to all of my friends from the Ranch that have been kind enough to show their support and take an interest in my journey. I encourage you to wander around the page, and send me a message from time to time. I will do my best to respond when I get into towns or have enough service and battery to respond.To my family; care packages are a wonderful gesture! No, I'm not in any position to beg for food...yet. Give it some time though. From here, you'll be able to find out where to send the goods. If you are so kind as to send me a few things, I encourage you to get creative.

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521809,"Looks like the official departure date will be Monday 2/29. This should put me in line to be at Amicalola Falls on 3/2. A few months back, my buddy Gray offered to drive me down to the trailhead. For this I am a million times thankful. Monday we begin the two day drive down the east coast. The plan is to overnight in Virginia, once more in Georgia, and then head to Amicalola Wednesday morning. Originally, we had planned to be on the Approach Trail for Saturday 3/5. Once we found out that Saturday would be the peak of the AT Kick Off event in the park, we decided it would be best to leave a little earlier. I'm sure that when we arrive, the area will be crowded either way, but at least we won't have too awful of a time getting up the trail itself.I've been through my entire pack contents over ten times now in the past week or so. Each time, I try to pull a few things out, and imagine trail life without them. So far, this has allowed me to cut back on about a pound and a half.When I first bought my pack, I took the top canister off so that I could cut down on weight. Everything fits into the pack without it, but I have a feeling that I want the little bit of space for my extra winter/cold weather gear. I'm weighing in at just under 21 for a base weight, but once the cold weather lifts, I anticipate to be somewhere in between 17 and 18 pounds as a base weight.",,Heritage House??,"Feb 11, Thu",0

But I figure I'll run with it until my thumbs cramp up, or I go blind from looking at this tiny screen.I've felt the entire spectrum of emotions ever since I started saying goodbyes to my friends and family in the past few days. Today on the 10 hour ride to our halfway mark, Virginia Beach, I had plenty of time to reflect on what I'm embarking on, and isolate each individual emotion.As I left my home in the hills, I couldn't help but feel apprehension coupled with a drive to succeed, mixed in with nostalgia for what life has provided me with up to this point. The further we drove, the more I realized how awful my feet are going to feel when this is all said and done -occupational hazard.I sat around a dinner table tonight in the home of my good friend, Gray's, family. I couldn't help but feel embraced with love. We laughed and shared stories about the different adventures we've all had. In that moment I realized that this was what the AT represents. These kindhearted people, not knowing me, or having ever have met me, opened their home and cooked me one of the finest jambalaya' ive had in a very long time. We looked at family photos together and they gave me a glimpse into their family and how they got to where they are today. I hope this pattern of love continues as I go forward, and I can offer whatever I have to give. Tomorrow we tackle the second 10 hour leg into Georgia. Time for sleep now. This pillow is calling my name.","Virginia Beach

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522547,"Today was my first full day on the trail. Woke up at stover creek and went roughly 11 miles to cooper gap. What we all anticipated as ""torrential downpours,"" turned out to be 3-5"" of snow. I hiked along a ridgeline, up, up and higher up until it was a complete whiteout. In the middle of the whiteout, I met Kevin who continued hiking along with me until cooper gap. We met ""Rescue"" and her service dog, ""bear"" as we continued down sassafras mountain. She was in need of water so I gave her a spare bottle I had. Once we got talking, we realized that Gooch mountain shelter, my destination for the day, was completely packed full. The blizzard was causing stranded hikers to set up right along side of the trail. We all pooled on on a shuttle ride to the nearest hostile to get out of the wet, cold monstrosity that had become our first day. Alpine, our shuttle driver and former thruhiker, explained to us that all hostiles in town were full due to the storm. We skipped up to Blairesville, aka ""Blairsvegas,"" and grabbed a motel for the night. Rescue treated us to the room, and dinner for helping her out of the storm that had her in a complete panic. I was able to clean my hiking boxers and socks in the motel tub with the camp soap I brought. I also grabbed a shower. In a way, I felt guilty for abandoning the trail so early and night fighting through the storm. I guess one of the largest parts of this journey is keeping your head straight and not making poor decisions based on impulse and a ""purist"" desire to hike every single foot of the trail.","Stover Creek

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522549,"Started at 8am at season hotel. Alpine picked us up with the Subie Shuttle in Blairesville and we made our way to Neel's gap. He told us he'd worked at the outfitter there for 6 years and had been married out back on the cliff in a Cherokee style wedding. The outfitter there is amazing to say the least. These guys give ""pack shakedowns"" to help lighten hiker's loads. At this point, 30 miles in, people are all feeling the weight. I talked to some other hikers that were carrying upwards of 55 pounds. My initial pack weighed in at 35 with food so I declined the shakedown and figured I had gone through my pack enough times to know what I did and didn't want/need. But, what I did do was switch up my footwear. I cashed in my big Asolo Fugitives for a pair of Oboz Traverse trail runners. For a long while I had convinced myself that I needed a full boot for ankle support, but as the staff member there, Squirrel, pointed out; hiking poles are ankle support. I couldn't be more satisfied with how they run. Absolutely amazing. They fit well with my insoles as well. I suspected that the blistering I was having from my boots was due in large part to the way my feet sat on the insoles in the boot. I also grabbed some athletic tape for my blister which did the trick for me.Kyle stuck around for the day with me to hike, and we parted ways with Rescue and Bear. We stopped early at 2:30 to give our bodies a break and to set up camp early. The hardest part right now is remembering that I have a long time to do this, and a lot of miles to cover. It's challenging to not get out there and just go full speed ahead. This break in period is only temporary, and once my body is accustomed to the weight, then I'll be able to put up the big mile days. I spilled some chunk chicken on myself as I was picking up trash around the site. Hopefully I don't turn into bear bait...sorry mom. I rubbed some soil on the clothing to mask the scent, and that seemed to do the trick.Signing off for tonight. I'm warm on top of a windy ridgeline listening to the rainfly flap around above me. Warm thoughts and sweet songs will carry me off to sleep.","Neel's Gap

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522926,"Finished the day today at 4400' above the town of Hiawassee GA on Tray Mountain. I put up 9.5 miles from the former Rocky Knob shelter to be here. Nothing too eventful happened, just walking and thinking. They say that's about 90% of this whole thing. You walk, you think, and walk and think. Every time I summit a south facing mountain, I can't help but wonder which ones I have and haven't come over. Maybe all of them, maybe just a few. We as hikers come out here to walk up one side of a mountain and come back down the other side. That's just the reality of it. Whether or not you favor going up or going down, you'll be doing your fair share of each every single day. As I walk past locals on the trail, they all ask if I'm going to Maine. I respond in a positive way that going to Maine is my intention and that's why I'm here on this trail. Some ask, ""Are you a thru hiker?"" And to this, I also have a response; ""We are not thru hikers until we reach Kathadin. For now, we are are simply hiking through""But it feels good to be walking through. I always looked up to the thru hikers as if they were super heroes. I'm not making any bold statements here, I'm simply saying that it's an honor to join the ranks of those who inspired me. That's the honest truth.","Old Rocky Knob Shelter site

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522929,"I slept well last night. I was warm in spite of the wind rolling over the side of the cliff. Every night I fall asleep to the flapping of the rainfly as it dances above me. Once it warms up, and the wind of the changing seasons dies down, I'll sleep under the stars. But for now, I'll have to poke my head out from time to time to catch a view. I made plans around the fire last night with a fellow hiker, Eric, to head into Hiawassee to grab a resupply and a hotel room. He left early and I caught up with him a few hours later about 5 miles down the trail. Before I ran into Eric though, I was passed by another hiker. This is not me tooting my horn, calling myself a speed demon, or claiming to be the best hiker out here at all. But this guy was the first person to actually walk past me on the trail since I've been out here. Sure other people have hiked farther in the day and gone on further, but I've never been physically passed. I didn't realize he was behind me until he was right there. I kindly swallowed my pride and stepped aside for him as I watched his pack disappear over the hill.This is the part where you expect me to disclose some profound lesson I learned about be passed, right? Nope. I chased him. I jumped a respectable distance behind him and chased him up the mountain. He didn't know I was there, and when he stopped for water he heard my poles clacking, faster and faster. This time, he turned around, and it was me right there. He laughed and darted up the hill. I chased him uphill for about a mile. Then I saw he had stopped to talk to someone, it was Eric laying on his pack, to the side of the trail. Eric looked at me and said, ""What'd you run here? I left over an hour before you and that was 2 hours ago!""The nameless man I had been chasing chuckled and responded that he could tell I didn't like to be passed. He said he could feel me pushing him up the hill. I told him as long as he pulled, I would push.So I made another friend, Slug ironically was his name. Slug confessed to me that he felt like a mechanical rabbit being chased by a dog. He asked me my name and I replied simply, ""Andy.""He told me that they should call me Greyhound for hiking like that. There it was, Greyhound. Now to the folks out here, living among me in our one night tent villages, I am Greyhound.","Tray Mountain Shelter
",Dick's Creek Gap,"Mar 07, Mon",11
Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522930,"After 11 miles of racing over hills with Slug, we reached Dick's gap. I met Slug's brother, Ripple, somewhere in between one hill and another. Eric arranged for a hitch into Hiawassee with a robust southern man who sported the Georgia AT plate on his Wrangler. This guy was a fellow hiker and you could tell he was honored to be our saving grace at the end of the day. He dropped us off at the Budget Inn in town. Centrally located, and with on site laundry machines, this place was perfect. But when they called it a ""budget"" inn, they meant it. Our towel rack was a piece of PVC pipe, and they made no attempt to hide it. Our room was down a long hallway, with a moldy, paint chipped concrete wall on one side and the decrepit motel room doors on the other. There was a green plastic roof covering this stretch so that when the sun beat overhead it had a green light about it. That beating sun also agitated the smell of the stale cigarette smoke that had seeped into every crevice of this hell. Now I mention this not because I'm unappreciative of what I had. I even commented to Eric as we walked down the highway to hell that this place was the Ritz Carlton of trail life. This is the reality of it. This is what we do out here to save a buck, grab a shower and clean our clothes. When I was standing in the parking lot of the Inn, waiting for Eric to book the room, a car pulled in. ""Hey Greyhound!""I turned around and it was Slug and Ripple. Cold beers in hand and huge smiles on there faces. They were staying in the room on the other side of us. I felt right at home knowing that other hiker trash were going to infest this place with us for a night. After grabbing cold beers of our own, Eric and I hit an all you can eat buffet up the road. We certainly ate all we could. It was unholy. There was pain, there was bloating and there were sounds gurgling coming out of my stomach that I'm pretty sure weren't healthy. But damn did it feel great. We retired to the Bates Motel to soak our sore feet and watch reruns of ""Cops.""","Dick's Creek Gap

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522931,"""He who has the longest beard has the right of way.""Eric decided to zero out the day at the Budget Inn to catch up on some rest. We bid each other farewell and I jumped into the rusty Ram Van shuttle that the Inn offered for hikers. We rattled out of the parking lot in this death trap, gears grinding and squeaking, and we ascended back up into the mountains. We were dropped off right at Dick's Creek Gap where we had left off the previous day. Slug and I made a pact to take it easy on one another. An armistice if you will. The plan was to go in about 5 miles, camp the night, and cross the state line in the morning. Once we hit that shelter, we felt great and decided to just push further.We wound up totaling in at 9 miles for the day, and crossed the state line into North Carolina. Not bad for what I had anticipated to be a zero day. My body feels amazing. The few issues I had with my feet were solved by the implement of Epsom salts, new footwear, exposure to air and Curad Silver Solution. I also made a stop into an outfitter being run out of a shed in the parking lot before I left. The guy in there running it was awesome. He filled my brain with all sorts of hiker know how and advised that I use body glide on my feet to prevent blisters and hotspots. I bought a dry sack for my food, sock liners, a titanium spork and a fuel canister from him also. Slug and Ripple have been great friends so far. They're older guys than me, but they have good spirits and like to have fun. Ripple is going to be pulling off the trail up ahead in NC, but Slug is staying on. I have a feeling I'll be hiking with Slug quite a bit since our personalities mesh well and we like to push one another as we hike. It's a good thing. Plus he's a fellow hammocker.The two brothers gave me a 45 minute demonstration on the PCT bear bagging method they had learned on YouTube. I think they need a little more practice, but we had quite a few laughs through the struggle of getting the bags up.I retire tonight to my comfortably hung hammock. Some nights are more comfortable than others, but I think I'm getting this thing down. I popped my head out earlier to look at the night sky. In those few seconds I saw a plane and a shooting star. It's a sign of good things to come as I've now crossed the border into North Carolina. It's a chain of small victories that lead to a large success. Today was a victory.","Hiawasse/Dick's Creek Gap

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523309,"Today was my second day of pushing past 15 miles. I did 15 yesterday, and a little over that today. Essentially, I'm testing the waters to see how my body handles the extra mileage. Even though I hike on a regular basis, I still have to be conscious of the physical strain that a 30+ pound pack puts on my body. My feet are callused up and are more than capable of doing the mileage, but I still get aches at the end of the day. Alpine, the first shuttle driver I met, told me that in generally takes 6-8 weeks before the human body is fully conditioned to do this everyday. Each day I feel stronger and stronger though. The past two days of hiking have consisted of winding through tunnels of rhododendrons. The thick, waxy leaves of the plant block out everything around you. Little slivers of light break through the cover and dance along the trail. As you walk over the light, it creeps onto your shoes and up your whole body until you are fully engulfed. I guess what I'm saying is that I have been wandering through a hiker disco party in the woods.When Slug and I arrived at Winding Stair Gap, there were coolers filled with soda and beer waiting for us. This was actually my first run in with trail magic since I've been out here. There was a note attached to the cooler from a former thru hiker. It read something along the lines of, ""Please, take only one so that everyone can enjoy. You made it past Georgia and nothing will stop you from making it to Khathadin."" I knew I liked this town already. Ripple, Slug's brother, had left the shelter earlier than both of us that morning. He was only spending ten days on the trail, because he has to go back to his family. But when we got to the gap, he was waiting there with his beefed up F-350 to take us into town. Me, Slug and two other hikers all piled into the bed of the truck. We drove down the highway with the wind in our hair. The mountains we had just crawled off of, came into focus for the first time. We rolled into Franklin to the Budgett Inn- yes another one. This one was much nicer than the previous one in Georgia. I shacked up with Riptide and Broken Hammock in order to save a couple of bucks. I opted to sleep on the floor, with my sleeping pad and bag. The five of us; Slug, Ripple, Broken Hammock and Riptide all hit the streets of Franklin looking like a homeless version of Reservoir Dogs. We first stopped at the outfitter, Outdoor 76. These guys were absolutely amazing. They were willing to spend an hour with a thru hiker just to make sure that their footwear was working for them. Great people. I could go on for hours about that place, but it's just something you'd have to see for yourself. They also had a newly constructed taproom with about 15 beers on tap, darts, a projection tv, and a stage with guitars and other instruments on it for anyone willing to get up there. We pretty much failed to get past the taproom once we realized that it existed. The beer started flowing, people poured in from the streets and Dominoes dropped of four large pizzas to our table. That's pretty much the night in a nutshell.I decided to zero out the next day in Franklin, as did Broken Hammock and Riptide. We all figured that this was the perfect location for us to all take our first zero day. The zero day condition of buffets for all meals, Walmart for resupply, and then more beer at Outdoor 76. I think I could get used to this.","Carter Gap Shelter

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523656,"""You can decide to quit a million times a day. As long as you decide not to quit a million and one times, then you'll be just fine.""Well it finally happened. I had my Lieutenant Dan moment. Existential to say the least, and just as much of a trial as I had expected it to be. But good news, I found my zen. Sewing, of all things, helped me come back to reality just long enough for the nerves to subside.I started the day off under the shade of my new awning. Slug was up about half an hour before me and already breaking down his gear. He took off about 15 minutes before I did, and I knew that'd be the last I'd see of him for the day. He's a quick one. But as I was about to leave camp, Magic came up the trail and we hiked out together.We tackled the 3300' ascent up from the NOC. Luckily, my campsite shaved off about 1100' of that, but it was still a test of endurance. The trail never gave relief. We went up one hill, to see another. Then at the top of that, another came into focus. This pattern repeated about 5 times until we reached the first shelter. We stopped there for lunch and refueled. My body was dragging, but once I ate, I found the energy I needed to power up the mountain. We summited Cheoh Bald, the last of the climbing, around 12:30. The view was spectacular, but the impending threat of a massive storm system coming in kept us from staying long. Magic went ahead of me as my body dogged down the steep decent. I looked out over the hills, and saw black clouds on the horizon. The whole way down the mountain I was fighting little showers that I thought were finally going to be the downpour. I changed in and out of my Saran Wrap rain gear 3 times. Once for hail, and twice for brief down pours.When the storm finally hit, I put on Darkside of the Moon and worked down the slippery boulders. I felt like it was appropriate music to wander into the unknown to. When I could finally see the road at Stecoah gap, it was about 650 feet straight below me. While trudging down the switchbacks, I could've sworn I smelled someone grilling. I decided it was wishful thinkingv , and kept going. When I reached the bottom of the gap, I saw Magic eating a hotdog and drinking a Coke. I couldn't believe it, right in the middle of a downpour, these two wonderful people set up a cookout for the hikers. With food in our stomachs, and sugar coursing through our veins, Magic and I started up the 2.4 mile ascent to the Brown Fork Gap. 0.6 of this section is known as ""Jacob's Ladder."" It's a 600' ascent into the hills. It was steep to say the least. The rain, which we didn't think could come down any harder, turned up to full blast just as we came to the hill. This, coupled with the first serious bout of rain in the trip, pushed me harder than ever. Over the sound of the rain rocketing into trees and earth, I shouted up to Magic, ""You know, Jacob's Ladder is a stairway to heaven!""So in the vein of the day's classic rock soundtrack, a little bit of ""Stairway"" was cranked into my earbuds. I sang as loud as I could over the rain. Magic joined in at times and we worked over the climb together; Me, Magic and Robert Plant. After sliding down the trail, which now resembled a stream, we reached the shelter. Of course it was full, but an old Golden Retriever came up to greet me as we approached. He looked just as weary as I imagined myself to be. I sat right down in the mud and spent about 5 minutes with this pup as he placed his head in my lap. I went down to set up my shelter in the rain. I spent about 20 minutes making adjustments to this awning. It was a poor time to try to figure out how to set it up. The rain came down and my frustration mounted. By the time I had my hammock and awning up, Magic was almost done with dinner. I took off my rain gear and clothes, and stared up into the watery sky with complete dissatisfaction and spite. I took two spoonfuls of peanut butter out of the jar, and set out to find a suitable place for my bear bag. I was too pissed off to have a meal. I found a dead tree that had grown as an arch. It took my about 15 tries to get the cord over the limb because I was too tired to throw a piece of string with a stick on it. After cursing out loud, and nearly hitting myself with the stick as it wrapped around the limb and came back towards me, my bag was set. More anger and frustration set in as I walked away. I was completely soaked through at this point, and had given up on the idea of dry. Just as I stripped off my wet clothes and climbed into my hammock, the clouds broke open. The sun came beaming through the fog that loomed on the hills and leafless trees and blinded me as it exploded onto the landscape. I decided this to be a peace offering, and my anger washed away. I felt completely at peace. I yelled over to Magic for his needle and thread. I spent the next hour and a half in the sun, listening to music and sewing the 2 foot hole in my bug fly. Between that whole experience, and sitting down to write this entry, I have found my peace. I'm sure there will be plenty of other excruciating days like this one, and I welcome that. This is what I came out here for, and the Appaclachian Trail has not disappointed me. Tomorrow I head to Fontana Dam. I'm ready to air out all of my gear and catch a few resupplies. I will say I'm not looking forward to these soggy clothes in the morning, but the sun will be shining on my shoulders, and that's all I need to get me through the day.","Nantahala Outdoor Center
",Brown Fork Gap Shelter,"Mar 14, Mon",14
Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524391,"In the wake of yesterday's frustration, I took a little extra time this morning. Everyone left the shelter by 8:30, and I kicked around until 10:30. I slept in until around 9 and then threw on Abbey Road while I cooked my breakfast. I made some strawberries and cream oatmeal packets that Broken Hammock had given me back in Franklin.As the sun came up over the hill, its warmth only made me want to spend more time relaxing. The shelters are incredibly peaceful once the ruckus of the morning shuffle files out. There was no crinkling of gear, zipping of tents or chatter about the day's plans. This was replaced with the chirping of the birds and the occasional rustle of the leaves as the wind blew through the valley. Before I packed up, I made a few finishing touches to my sewing job that I had done the night before. After that, I trimmed my extra large Tyvek tarp that I had been carrying, into a smaller, more manageable piece.I finally packed out and began the hike to the legendary Fontana Dam. Halfway into the hike I stopped at the Cable Gap shelter to make lunch. I heated up my Uncle Ben's rice and beans, threw in some taco seasoning and beef jerky, then wrapped it up in a whole wheat tortilla. Kind of a deluxe trail lunch.At the shelter, I met Journey Man and his friend Pete. Journey Man is an older guy from Ashville, NC. He has short white hair and a matching trimmed beard. He speaks with a slow, precise southern accent. Every word that he speaks seems well thought out and perfectly picked. He explained to me that his trail name comes from his belief that the trail is not about finishing and getting to Khatadin, but rather the journey that occurs in the process. Journey Man and I had a nice conversation about the events that had happened to me the night before. I told him that I was deciding to take more time with everything and be more conscious of hike, rather than blowing through it. His perception of the trail reinforced this. As he and his friend left to continuing hiking, Northstar and Weatherman came down the hill into the shelter. Northstar is a fellow New Englander, from Vermont specifically. I had met him a few days earlier at a diner back in Franklin. He was having an issue with a few blisters. The day before, I had lunch with him and gave him a few tips to try to dry the blisters out. He told me that they were healing up nicely since he had lanced them. We parted ways as I continued on for the day. We met up later down the trail as I was refilling my water at a stream. The three of us made the steep descent hiked down to Fontana together. As we hiked, we talked about our lives back home, why we were out here and what we expected from the trip. I found out that Northstar used to work as a group leader for Outward Bound and was on a search and rescue team in the White's. He was also a Hutsman, a job that carries a ton of prestige among hikers in the north. He told me a couple of search and rescue stories from Mt. Washington and how they all played out. I welcomed the opportunity to pick his brain a little bit about the particularly interesting work. Finally, we came into the marina. We phoned for a ride to the lodge. As we waited I saw the dog I had sat with the night before at Brown Fork Gap. His name was Theo and he was a service dog for Sojo, an older hiker. We all talked about Fontana and how iconic of a location it was. Sojo and Northstar said that they had dreamed about it for 30 years. It's one of those spots that's purely AT and represents an achievement; we made it this far. The shuttle picked us up 20 minutes later and we headed down the winding road into Fontana Village. The village was small and was built around a resort. Most of the groceries in the store were overpriced, but this was the last stop before we head up into the smokies. After filling up, I went and put a few clothes in the wash. I waited on the porch in a rocking chair, drinking cold beer and talking to hikers as they passed by. I retired for the night not much later. Weatherman was kind enough to give me the other bed in the hotel room. We fell asleep with the coverage of the primaries on local news. Every time I come into a town seems to be a Tuesday. With the media circus swirling around all of the primaries, I'm more and more appreciative to be out here and displaced from it all.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

I said goodbye to all of the guys I had met the night before at the hotel bar. ""T Minus"" and his crew came from New York to drive with a group of people to Miami. The drivers had flown in from all over the country to be there. They were part of a road rally of Ferraris, Porches and Lamborghinis.After breaking a cardinal rule of mine, buying a bottled water, I hopped in the van with two younger guys, 16 and 17. The younger of the two had spent the past few days holed up at the lodge after a round with the Norovirus. It wasn't confirmed, but news of his sickness spread quickly throughout the hiker community. Norovirus to a thru hiker is like the plague. It spreads quickly, and everyone is terrified of it. It usually entails about 1-3 days of puking and diarrhea. It's an inconvenience to say the absolute least. I'm doubtful that what this guy had was the Noro. Everyone has been on such high alert about the sickness, it's like a witch hunt. It seemed more to me like he had food poisoning. When I left the shuttle I headed out on the 2 mile hike around Fontana lake. The cliffs were about 100 feet down to the shore line. It looked to me like the water level had been drained significantly for the winter. I passed the notorious Fontana Hilton, ground zero for the Norovirus, and went directly to the dam. Fontana Dam was even more amazing than I could have possibly imagined. It stands as the highest dam east of the Mississippi River. I spent about half an hour there listening to music and soaking up the sunny view. A lady bug crawling across the rails was subject to 10 minutes of my time as I tried to get the perfect picture of it. From the dam, I made the steep ascent up into the Smoky Mountain National Park. After 2 or so hours of climbing, I reached the Shuckstack fire tower. My adventurous side wanted to climb up into the dilapidated old tower to see the beautiful view that I knew was up there. My rational side saw the pieces of the tower on the ground and cautioned that this would be a sketchy move. Naturally, my irrational adventurous side won the battle and I worked my way up into the 50 foot tower. The steps were narrow and creaked as I stepped on them. There was just enough room to make a turn to each flight of stairs. The wind picked up as I reached the top. The old glass panes that remained in the windows rattled in the gusts. I took a couple of quick videos and headed down after a few minutes of tempting fate. With a new appreciation of being back on the ground, I headed back onto the trail. I went further than I had originally planned. There was a campground about 7 miles in, but I decided to make it a full day and went 12 up to Mollies Ridge Shelter.Just before the shelter, I ran into Journey Man again. We walked into the site together, both relieved that we had finally made it up into the Great Smoky Mpuntains.","Fontana Village

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524759,"I took my time getting out of the shelter today. I was the second to last to leave. The last guy out was Spaceman, a guy I had met while eating dinner around camp the night beforeAs I set off on the trail, I wasn't even wholeheartedly sure that I was on the AT. The haze of the morning can lead to hikers going the wrong direction and sometimes missing turns where the AT veers into other trails. There are a ton of other trail systems that lead through the Smokies, and I thought for sure I had wound up on one of those. It must've been close to 3/4 of a mile before I saw my first white blaze. It was old though. Just the outline of the white paint was visible on the decaying bark of an old tree. One would think that after paying to have a permit to hike through these hills, they would be a little more well put together. All of the hikers joked about this every time we saw a fallen tree across the trail. Money well spent!Another problem with the smokies was the fact that we were being forced to carry that permit with us at all times. If a ranger stopped us and wanted a look, we had to provide proof that we had paid to be there. The last thing everyone was up in arms about was that we were being forced, by park regulation, to sleep in the shelters. If a day hiker came through, and wanted to sleep in the shelter, no matter what time it was, we had to give up our spot. But, if the shelter was full, we could tent anywhere. Most people come out here to avoid fines and regulations. The smokies definitely left a bitter taste in a lot of people's mouths for this. As I walked over the hills I noticed a few fires off in the distance. After checking the news on my phone, I realized that they were controlled burns commissioned by park staff. They were coming from two opposite ends of the park and emitting massive plumes of thick, gray smoke that filled the sky for miles around. I made it to Rocky Top at lunch. There I found Handles, another hiker I met last night at camp. He was wrapping up his own lunch and smoking a rollie cigarette in the sunshine. We talked for awhile, and after a brief moment of terror due to my misplacing my stove, I began making my own meal. Handles bid me happy trails and worked his way down the hill. As he left he began singing ""Rocky Top"" by the Osborne Brothers. I could hear him singing all the way down the hill. From the view I could see Fontana Lake and dam looking like they were impossibly far away. It was hard to imagine that I was there just less than 24 hours ago. In fact, I could look out over the small section of the Smokies that I had conquered, and pick out every little hill that I climbed. Having this sense of orientation is rare out here for me. Back home, I know every hill inside and out, here not so much. Spaceman came over the hill and we had a quick conversation about the terrain ahead. I took off to the trail and ran into him again about an hour later. We hiked for awhile together as he told me about his 5 deployments overseas in the Army. There are a lot of vets out here on the trail. They all seem to have the same reasoning for being out here, to just clear their heads. With the amount of thinking and meditation we hikers do on a regular basis, I understand why it helps. I've never been to war, but I make a point to thank every vet that I meet out here that has. The trail has a way of bringing people with all sorts of backgrounds together. We ran into Handles again after that. He was smoking another cigarette on a fallen tree. He explained his hiking theory to us; wake up early, take your time, stop an hour for lunch and stop a lot to smoke cigarettes. It's kind of amazing how many people smoke out here. You would think that would be the last thing on everyone's minds as they ascend the mountains, but apparently it's the first. The three of us made a plan to do some night hiking together so we could grab a sunrise view the next morning. When we hit the next shelter, 13 miles into our day, we explained to our group of fellow hikers that we were going to keep going. Some said we were nuts, some said have fun.Spaceman stayed behind so he could hike through the night alone. Handles and I walked together as we tried to solve the problems of the universe. It's fascinating to me how emotionally in depth some trail conversations can get.We came into camp that night at 10:30. We quietly moved in and made a point to not wake everyone up at the site. We set our alarms for 6:15 and agreed to hit the trail by 7 to grab the sunrise. I fell right asleep desire my aches and pains from my first big mile day.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524764,"3/18Handles and I started out of the shelter today at 7. We woke up at 6, in the cold, so that we could catch the sunrise. Derrick Knob was only a few minutes up the trail. When we got there I mixed some hot cocoa and coffee together and cooked some oatmeal. The picture you see to the left was what we saw as we sat there in amazement.The sun came up over Clingman's Dome, the high point of the AT, and lit up the whole sky. We stayed for about an hour or so as other hikers passed through asking if that was us that showed up so late the night before. Last ones in, first ones out. We packed up our things and made our way down the trail with the warmth of the sun now in our favor. The climb up to Clingman's dome was very mild as are most of the trails here in the Smokies. From what I've gathered, the grade of the trails was designed so that horses could get through, so it's never too steep. There are no dogs allowed in the Smokies, but horses are welcome on the trail through this section. Clingman's Dome offered a full 360° view. We made our way up into the spiral observation deck along with a group of road bikers. I sat and made some Ramen and Knorr Pasta Sides for lunch. We snapped our fair share of photos and then began the descent towards Newfound Gap. Honestly, I'll take going up over going down any day. Coming down really does a number on your knees, especially with the weight of the pack. I try to take as many breaks as I can so that I don't get too sore. It's like pulling over to let your brakes cool off when you're driving down a steep mountain. It takes you a little longer to get down, but saves you from having to deal with the nonsense in the long run.We called ahead to see about vacancies in Gatlinburg. I wasn't going to stop because I've been staying at a lot of hotels, but I needed the resupply. We weren't even at the gap 20 seconds and a guy pulled over to ask if we needed a lift into town. We found out he had just been doing some mountain biking up on Clingman's Dome. He had told his friends that he was going to find some hikers to bring into town on his way home. We were thankful to have such an easy hitch in.There was definitely a pretty rapid transition as we made our way out of the mountains. We went from pines and towering Rocky hills to neons, t shirt shops and henna tattoo stands. I couldn't believe how many people were in town. The guidebook described Gatlinburg as ""a tourist Mecca."" This is an amazingly accurate description. It was like they stuck an amusement park smack dab in the middle of the Smokies.Scott, our hitchhiking hero, dropped us off at the Grand Prix motel and wished us luck. We walked in, set up our room and 2 night stay, then made our way out to see what Gatlinburg was all about. It took us about 30 minutes to figure that one out.","DerrickKnob Shelter

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524765,"3/20Handles and I left the motel today at 9 am. We grabbed some biscuit sandwiches before we caught the shuttle at 10 out of the NOC. As we worked our way up back up into the smokies, the snow started to appear. At Newfound Gap, the snow and ice covered the trees. An anxious group of hikers waited to take the shuttle back down into Gatlinburg. Snow in their hair and beards, they warned of icy trail conditions. We bid farewell to the shuttle driver and thanked us for the lift. Handles asked his name and he reluctantly told us it was ""Bad Weather."" After a good laugh and a few funny looks from the crowds of visitors gathering at the gap, we headed back onto the trail. Only 1972 miles to Katahdin. The day's hike consisted of a nice gradual ascent into the frosted trees. The green tunnel had transformed into the white tunnel. Ice had frozen on the branches of little trees and outlined every single branch. The higher we went, the more ice we saw on the trees. There were no views, only blank canvases as we stared out into the white at each vista. At lunch, the snow began. First it came down in little hail pellets. The rocks and roots on the trail grew icy. Then it came down in big fluffy white flakes that swept diagonally across the trail in the wind. The two of us cooked dinner under the roots of an overturned tree. We deliberated going another 5 miles to the next shelter. But the weather looked better at Pecks Corner and it was getting late. We rationalized that it would be better to have more time to set up and hunker down for the snow storm. The sun is setting now. I changed out of my wet snow covered gear and into the various layers of warm weather gear in my dry sack. The weather report for this shelter says that it'll get down to 18° tonight. Some strong gusts are possible as well as another 1-3 inches of snow. Every now and then until I fall asleep, I shake the snow off of the awning above me. Hopefully the weight of the snow doesn't cause it to collapse in the night. I keep joking that I drove 20 hours to come back to New England. As I lay here, admiring my breath as it fogs the screen of my phone, I'm starting to believe that it's true. Happy Spring!","Gatlinburg
",Pecks Corner Shelter,"Mar 20, Sun",10.20
Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525636,"Well when I woke up this morning there was 6"" of snow all around me. I'll have to admit that I contemplated just sitting around all day and waiting for it to melt. Then I realized that I was 6000' up in the mountains, and this was probably going to take a few days. I also couldn't help but hear Alpine's voice ringing in my ears, ""The one that makes it to Maine is the one that gets up every morning and hikes no matter what the weather.""So, I took a deep breath, threw my sleeping bag off of me and went to work. I did a pretty decent job of keeping my gear out of the snow. But my hands were cold and the dexterity wasn't 100% there. I sat there on the ground, under my awning like a kid at a beach surrounded my sand piles. Except it was the polar opposite, pun intended. I threw on the Beach Boys over my phone just because it was too ironic not to do. There was a moment where I was completely disheartened by the fact that it was miserable out. But I stopped for a second and told myself to just do what I knew I had to do, pack up and get hiking. It's hard sometimes to simplify things out here, but that's ultimately what it comes down to. You know you have to do it, even if it's a challenge. This is what I wanted and I just had to work through it.I took a step away from the misery for a second and realized that this was completely beautiful. I was spoiled this winter back home with a lack of snow, and this seemed to make up for it. All of a sudden, I realized that I'm a New England boy and this is my bread and butter. Cold weather and snow is what we do.After I packed everything up, I headed down to the shelter to grab some water and cook breakfast. I had felt completely alone in my hour it took to get everything ready. But as I walked down, I found that there were about 8 hikers holed up in the shelter complaining about the cold and snow. Since I had already mentally moved past this stage in the morning, I decided that it was time to move out. On my way out, I gave some reassurance to my fellow hikers, and urged them to, ""Think warm thoughts.""As soon as I got to hiking and set up my layers for the climbing and windy ridges, I was in heaven. The clouds had moved off the mountains giving way to a completely frosted landscape. The snow was clinging to every twig and every needle on every fir. It highlighted all there was to see.I soon passed groups of hikers that had left well before me. I pushed on harder and harder, but the progress was slow due to the thick layer of snow. Every step forward was countered with the slightest slide of reverse progress. It took me about 2 and a half hours to make it to the first shelter that was 4.7 miles away. On my way there, I had toyed around with the idea of finishing the Smokies completely today. That would entail 20 miles of hiking through the deep snow and inevitable slush as the day warmed. When I got to the shelter for lunch, I ran into Tesla and Rash. They were the two younger guys I had met in the shuttle on the way to Fontana. I bounced the idea of a 20 miler to them, which would mean hiking through the night a little ways. They said they were already thinking about it so we planned to meet up at the next shelter and hike through the night. For some reason, many hikers are turned off by night hiking. We were 2 days out from a full moon, and with all of the snow cover, it would still stay light out once the sun dropped. I knew it was a smart move because the temperature was going to be about 25-30° warmer once we dropped the 4500' out of the Smokies. Tesla and Rash were there waiting at the Cosby Knob Shelter along with the entire group that had left Pecks Corner this morning. They all said we were nuts for pushing that hard after such a big day. I figured they were nuts for wanting to stay another night on these cold and slushy mountains. I ate a quick dinner, donned my Petzl headlamp, and made for the trail. We had another 7.9 miles to get out of the Smokies. These kids were hiking hard. At this pace I figured that we'd make it down by 9:30. After we worked over the 2 climbs there was a very, very steady descent into the valley below. We stopped at a little rock outcrop for a photo op at sunset.After a couple hours of knee busting descending, we saw the National Forest boundary. We all high fived and realized we still needed to find a place to stealth camp for the night. About a mile up the trail, there was a a little spot that was sufficient to our needs. We threw up the bear bags, set up camp and reveled in the 50° weather we were dozing off in. ""Those poor bastards up on the mountain"" was all that ran through my head as I nodded off.","Pecks Corner Shelter

I set my laundry line up the night before so that it would be facing the east. This way, the morning sun would hit my wet gear and dry them as I packed up. Rash, Tesla and myself made our way to the Standing Bear Hostel which was only a half mile off the trail. When we got there, we were greeted by and older guy who called himself ""Lumpy."" Lumpy gave us the ""nickel tour of the property."" They had all sorts of food and items in their resupply shed. The three of us split a frozen pizza and cooked it in the kitchen provided on property. There was a guitar inside that belonged to the recently departed founder of the hostel. I spent some time playing some music while we waited for the pizza to cook. We left the hostel and as we walked down the dirt road, there was a car from some section hikers that had paint markers sitting on the hood. The windshield read, ""Thru hikers write on me!"" We obliged and continued on.After a steady ascent back up to 4300' we started to see snow again. We reached the top of snowbird mountain and stumbled upon an FAA air traffic control station. It looked like a UFO that had crash landed on top of the mountain. We were 9 miles out from Max Patch, an iconic location on the trail. It was already 5 because we had spent so much time roasting in the sun at Standing Bear. The three of us devised a plan to catch the sunset off of Max patch, but we had just under 3 hours to make it there. I kicked into high gear and hiked through as fast as I could. I made great time, but the steep hills started to drain my energy pretty quickly. As I hiked through the forest I smelled and saw smoke in the air. I could see it looming over the mountains. The dry weather that we've been having made me inclined to believe that there was a wildfire, but it could have been a controlled burn just the same. The sun turned a deep blood red as it set over the smoke covered hills. It was hard to admit the defeat that I didn't make it to Max Patch before sunset, but I rationalized that there were many sunsets along the trail to be seen. Another life lesson hatched from a small instance.When I finally reached Max Patch, the full moon had risen. The light poured over the hills and valleys below like a single candle in a dark room. I'm sure that on a sunny day, this is a spectacular view, but it was truly unique to be there right at the beginning of the full moon. We sat for over an hour on the bald talking about life philosophy, spooky ghost stories and things we had seen along the trail. These guys are young, but incredibly smart. I'm envious that they're coming into a sense of adulthood out here on the trail. I'm well aware that I am too in many ways, so I venture to guess that this is why I've enjoyed spending time with them.","Standing Bear Hostel

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525645,"They call it being sucked into a vortex. And they call this a trail family. My time in Hot Springs has shown me the true spirit off the trail. We all joke about getting off the trail and just living here by the river bank. That doesn't sound like such a bad idea to me.My day started at the Laughing Heart Hostel, a stones throw away from the trail. I spent the day there yesterday zeroing out. As the day went on, plenty of familiar faces began to roll in. When I arrived on Wednesday at around 8pm there were only a few people around. I met Snail Pace, a Sobo hiker, who had been at the hostel for 3 days and is staying here through the Easter weekend. The managers, Tie and Solo, were out to dinner with some friends who own a hostel up in Maine. Snail Pace was left to show people around and set up rooms for the couple while they were out. I decided to tent out back, and figured that to be the cheaper option. The next morning, I found that there was a work for stay option. Many hikers stuck around to help clean and do landscaping work, in exchange for a free nights stay. I decided to zero out Thursday and do some work around the hostel to get rid of the charge.There was a storm headed in on Thursday night, so the hostel filled up pretty quickly. Even more faces lured in, and soon, I knew almost everyone in the hostel. There were about 20 hikers there. Snail Pace, and a few other hikers cooked up a big batch of goulash, salad and pizzas for all of the hungry hikers. The food in the kitchen of the hostel was all free. Every Tuesday someone from the local church dropped off a shipment of fresh food for the hikers. We cooked ourselves a feast and all ate together. There were movies on the tv in one bunk room, and a crowd of hikers on the back porch reuniting with friends. It was like being at a family dinner at your grandmother's house. We all laughed and ate until there was no more room, then we are more. Tie and Solo wandered throughout the hostel, like mom and dad, watching over the hikers and making sure everyone had everything they needed. That night, I put the hammock up in some trees out on the property and decided to ride out the storm. It never really came full force, but there was some wind that came with heavy rain. I was grateful to be able to fall asleep eating trail mix seeing as I was camping in someone's backyard, and not in black bear country. I woke up around 8 and grabbed a cup of coffee. Some hit the trail, and others stayed to help clean. As I sat on the porch drinking coffee with Snail Pace, he told me a little bit about his life and everything that brought him out here. He gave me the sad news that his hiking partner, his dog Bo had to be euthanized the day before due to a heart condition. I could feel his sadness at the loss of this pal and sensed that enjoyed being able to talk to someone about it. A truck pulled up the driveway and a man got out looking to recruit the help of a few hikers. This man, Pete, owned an inn down the road and was good friends with Tie and Solo. I worked it out so that my work for stay would consist of helping Pete down at his inn. Tie gave me some change for laundry down the road, and a Tide Pod. She wished me luck and I was on my way.In a way, Tie and Solo were very much the trail parents to this ragtag group of smelly hikers. A lot of us out here are younger people, so I think they take on the responsibility to see that the hikers are healthy, but well behaved as well. They were both in their late 50's, maybe early 60's, and you could sense that they knew the spirit of the trail. They never told us their personal experiences out on the trail, but the way they carried themselves, it was obvious that they had spent a great deal of time catering to it. They were both very quiet and kind people, but had a stern approach that you didn't want to disappoint. They were well respected by everyone who came through their doors. The hostel had an incredibly ""homey"" vibe to it, and this was due completely to the love that this couple put into it. I headed off into town to throw in a load of laundry, and then headed over to the Magnolia Inn, where Peter, Snail Pace and Optimistic Dreamer were waiting for my help.After about 40 minutes of work, I went back to grab my laundry. Handles was there and invited me just down the road to the campground his family was staying at for the Easter weekend.

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525649,"So I've been in Hot Springs now for three days. Not quite sure how it happened, but I suspect that it was the temptation of free food and a nice spot to camp by the river.I've been with King Arthur, Hot Rabbit, Learning Curve and Alpha sitting on a sandy river bank soaking up the sun. Yes there's been a little bit of beer involved, but the main temptation has honestly been the food provided by Handles' parents. They've been more than hospitable to us. We've had hamburgers, hot dogs, salads, spaghetti, bacon and eggs, and the list goes on. I built a fire pit when we first got here, and it's been the center of our day to day activities. Wake up, get the fire going, spend all day eating and gathering wood, then keep the fire going into the night. This has been our routine. It's peculiar to me how the trail feels so far away even though we've only been off for two days. The temptations of ""civilization"" sets in pretty quickly. Everything we need is readily available. There are showers at the campground, bathrooms, convenience stores etc. But it's too easy. That's not what we signed up for. Yesterday was the day I decided I needed to leave, but I do enjoy the company of these new friends so I stuck around the extra day to leave tomorrow morning. The way I see it, the problem with towns is that this is where you spend money. So if everything is provided for you, and you're not spending money, might as well soak up some rays on the river bank.So that's what we've done. Knowing that Easter is coming up, it's nice to have some companionship. I've packed up some spam, stuffing, gravy and cranberries for Easter dinner tomorrow night. It's comforting to know that tomorrow I'll be back on the trail, somewhere up in these hills that look over the town of Hot Springs.

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527027,"Well I finally made it out of the Hot Springs vortex. Next destination for a resupply is Erwin, TN. It's about a 70 mile hike, so I figure about 4 days of hiking.My general resupply stops are about every 4 days. I pack in about 8-10 lbs of food and hit a grocery store or Dollar General to grab what I need. Most of what we eat can be found at low cost at little stores like this. But a super market is a jack pot where you can grab all of your little specialty items. Erwin has a Walmart so that'll be a good resupply point. A lot of hostels in between towns offer resupplies, but they're usually pretty marked up. I really felt the few days I spent off the trail. I swear I've gone completely soft after only 72 hours. There was a pretty steep climb out of town. I could see that it was taking its toll on the other hikers as well. After about 5 hours of hiking, we wound up at the Spring Mountain shelter and decided that it was time to set up for the night. I've fallen into a groove of doing between 10-15 miles after a resupply. Your pack is heavy because of all of the food. Usually, after that day, you've worked into at least 2, maybe 3 lbs of what you brought in. It sounds like nitpicking, but every pound really does count. Even when I refill my water bottles, I can feel the difference. I suppose that's why hikers are always talking about all of the wonderful ways we can cut down on weight.I've been hiking along with the guys from Hot Springs. After the big climb out of town, we settled in 11 miles up the trail at the Spring Mountain shelter. There I made my stuffing and Spam Easter dinner. As I laid by the fire, I looked up into the night sky and thought about my family back home. These are some of the many emotional hurdles faced. I'm displaced from my home and everyone I love, but this is the journey and these are the sacrifices made. While I laid down for bed, the wind circled the vallies below me like waves crashing into the shore.They worked over the ridges, rocking my hammock as the gusts passed over me.

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527161,"Yesterday was spent hiking through soggy terrain with Alpha. We covered 18 miles together as we flip flopped over the Tennessee/North Carolina state line. Alpha shared stories of his service as a paratrooper in the Army and opened up to me about his life back home. I shared with him my own story. In my experience so far, there is much to be said for vulnerability. Hikers acquire it the day they set foot on the trail and carry it throughout. Vulnerability breeds a robustness that is unmistakable. We travel over hills with heavy hearts that surpass the physical weight of our packs, and because we are alone in each of our journeys, the barriers that exist off the trail no longer apply. The openness among hikers is what makes us family. The daily challenges may be faced alone throughout the day, but at the end of the day, we've all done it. These shared trail experiences transcend and manifest themselves in a deep, personal connection among all who walk.We hiked into the night and met up with Hot Rabbit, King Arthur and Learning Curve who were stealth camping at a grove right at the base of Big Butt mountain. Yes, that is the legitimate name of the mountain. The next morning we all left at separate times. I was the last one out, as usual. Alpha was racing to get to a gap where he was going to meet an old army buddy. He hiked ahead with purpose, and I didn't see him the rest of the day. The other guys were going to stop at a hostel a few miles down trail to resupply.As I stopped at a stream to gather water, I met up with a couple from Minnesota that I had met early on in the hike. I first met them while hitching into Franklin, NC. They had set aside a few weeks for the trail and were aiming to accomplish as many miles as possible in that time. Today was their last day on trail and they were in high spirits. I hiked with them until they stopped at Devil's Fork Gap where they had arranged for a shuttle off trail. In the hour we spent together, they recounted their experiences out here. We explored the juxtaposition between trail life and real life. Lessons learned on the trail, while specific to the outdoors and survival, are applicable to our lives at home. I was honored to walk the last steps of this journey with them. When we arrived at the gap, I laid in the sunny field by the road's edge for an hour or so. We wrapped up our conversation and they wished me well. Before we parted ways, they offered to pack out my trash for me and gave me a full resupply of all their left over foods. Food is like gold out here. Water is incredibly valuable as well, but we all have the opportunity to pull from streams and springs for that. I was excited for them that they were returning home with such a positive outlook on their experience. And in a strange way, I was envious that they were going home. I briefly entertained the idea of going into Asheville with them to check out the town, but then decided it was best to just stay on trail and do what I set out to do. I continued hiking solo up to the top of the ridge. The hike up went alongside cascades that rained from high above. It's special to see water in this volume. We depend so heavily on these little trickles of water from springs, so to see water in such an abundance has fostered a higher appreciation for moments like this. The weather was hot and the sun strong as I worked across the ridge. There were no other hikers in sight and the landscape offered a much appreciated solitude. Despite the cascades below, water was sparse at the higher elevation. When I reached the shelter, the water source was nothing but a shallow muddy stream. It took me 10 minutes to gather 2 liters of water. It was still fairly early, but I decided to set up camp and enjoy the sun while I could.Soon after, the others that had gone to resupply at the hostel showed up. They too decided this was a good place to stop for the night. We all ate dinner together and sat around a fire that was provided to us by an older section hiker named Turtle. Even though he was 40 years our senior, our shared experiences here on the Appalachian Trail made Turtle our peer. That's the way it is out here. After all, the AT is ""A footpath for those who seek fellowship with the wilderness."" This fellowship with the wilderness accompanies the fellowship among hikers. No barriers, just brothers and sisters.","Spring Mountain Shelter

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529273,"""My brother, where do you intend to go tonight?I heard that you missed your connecting flightto the Blue Ridge Mountains, over near Tennessee.""Today was my first big mile day. I left Hogpen Gap shelter pretty early. That is to say, if I can be packed up, have eaten breakfast and I'm on the trail by 7, then that's early. The terrain has been fairly flat. Steady rolling hills lead up to grassy balds and green hills. I hiked alone and tossed around the idea of hiking the 26 miles into Erwin. It would be a feat, but a grueling one. I came up over the first hill of the day to see King Arthur and Handles sitting in a field together. Arthur took off, but Handles and I decided to hike together once again. Once in awhile we encounter a bald or two, but they usually come and go. Big Bald nearly knocked me down with its beauty. I could see field after field of yellowish brow grass as the trail split the fields in two. All along the way, there were old weathered posts with fresh white blazes on them. This was the mental image of the trail that I had before I came out here. A lot of the trail out here is similar to home, but these balds, these are different. I walked in wide open fields, high above the towns below for over an hour. I stopped to take as many photos as I could. The hardest part was keeping the pace going and not stopping to take picture after picture after picture. The beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains had captivated me through in a million different ways. Handles and I stopped after awhile to make lunch and I bounced the idea of going into Erwin off of him. He agreed that it would be a good time to increase the mileage and see how our bodies faired. We were excited to pass all of our friends at the last shelter before town. When we arrived, we realized that they too had decided to go the distance. So, the two of us hiked into the dark, headed the last 7 miles into town. The way into town was a steep drop. We could see the town below us, but never car any closer. We worked through 14 switchbacks before the distant street lights emerged in front of us. We had finally made it to Erwin. We had no idea what our plan was or where were were going to stay, but like a mirage, Uncle Johnnie's hostel appeared in the distance. I saw Hot Rabbit laying in a hammock on the porch. He couldn't believe we had made it in so late. We were the last ones in, by far. But we were just happy to be there with all of our friends. We stayed the next day where I again did work for stay. The day was filled with usual in town activities including a provided shuttle over to the local Walmart. At the end of the night, the hostel played the Revenant on their outdoor TV. All of the hikers and hostel staff gathered around to watch. Feeling oddly inspired by this first viewing of the film, I went to bed. I faded into sleep while down pouring rain slammed off the tin roof not but a foot above my top bunk bed.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529274,"After last nights late haul in, I woke up to hikers filing out of the shelter. As I poked my head out of my tent, I saw Learning Curve headed up the hill. He was surprised to see me. I had shown up in the night while everyone else was fast asleep, grabbed water and camped out up on the hill above the shelter.That's kind of been my style out here. I'm the guy that's utterly useless before 10am, but has no problem putting up 10+ miles after sunset. I'm not really a morning person, even though I've tried time and time again to convince myself that I am. Some mornings out here start with me doing my whole routine before I leave camp, and other mornings I do what I need as I go along. One thing is for sure though, I was a fool for ever thinking that coffee would not still be essential in my life. I've found that a couple of instant packets in some hot water packs a nice punch. Out here in the woods, that hot cup of coffee makes you feel a little more human. Sometimes, it's hard to remember that we're humans out here. We rummage through trash like raccoons, do our business off to the side of the trail like a dog, and we'll eat any mess of scraps like a pig from a trough. We've still got our ability to get a fire going though. That's gotta count for something. With Damascus 3 days in our future, Learning Curve and I hit the trail together. It's a big step to make it to Damascus. It's the trail town of trail towns. This is where the annual Trail Days festival is held. Each year, in May, thousands and thousands of hikers flock to Damascus for trail days. It's a combination of a music festival and a family reunion. Hikers come here to reconnect with one another after their through hikes and to network with gear companies and people in the the industry. It's another one of those milestones that I'll be proud to reach.Learning Curve and I walked together all day. We put up 18 miles to the Laurel Fork shelter. Most of the day was business as usual; walk, eat, talk, eat, talk, eat, walk. You get the gist of it. We passed through groves of rhododendrons, and an abundance of little stream crossings as we worked through the Cherokee National Forest. It's nice to have company whilst solving the problems of the world. I appreciate my time alone, which was the main reason I came out here. But a big part of choosing a north bound hike was because I knew I'd have company along the way. Towards the end of the day descended towards Dennis Cove road, just outside of Hampton, TN. There was an old barn which I stopped to take pictures of. It's places like this that make you feel the seemingly ancient human presence along the way. We spend so much time exploring the truly eternal beauty of the wilderness we work through, but it's this human aspect that reminds us that there have been people many generations before us inhabiting these areas. Many of these lands were donated, by the previous owners, so that the wilderness could be protected for all to enjoy. Some land, was claimed by the government in an effort to do just the same. That's what the barn represented to me.Just before I reached the road, I saw a dog jump out of the bushes. I have no idea where it came from, I suspect probably one of the houses down the street. He gave a quick bark and disappeared into the greenery. I thought at first it could be stray, but then something odd happened. I could actually smell that this dog was clean. Then I got to thinking, this dog, a completely random dog pooping in the bushes, smells cleaner than myself. Weird. The next section I came to was breathtaking. Large sections of rock had been blasted away and the trail ran through. Maybe an old railway or something of that nature. I could see the way the rock had been folded over millions of years of pressure. There was a long descent down a staircase of rocks down to Laurel Falls. My knees never favor this type of activity. So I made like Rainman and counted the steps as I went to distract myself from the crushing pain. There were 306 steps down to the falls. We'll say plus or minus 5 steps, but I'm not willing to go back and do a recount. When I arrived at the shelter, I was alone on the cliff side overlooking the roaring river below. The terrain was rocky and unfavorable for a tent so I hung the hammock. Learning Curve eventually made his way up the steep trail and tossed his poles against the side of the shelter. He was frustrated because he had hiked almost a mile past the shelter due to poor signage. That night we lit a fire and ate on the deck of the shelter. The sun dropped down behind the rocky cliffs and exploded in shades of purples, reds, pinks and oranges. I joked that it was like a screen saver. There was peace as we basked in the satisfaction of full stomachs. Our serenity was disturbed when two massive rats, not mice, came off the shelter walls and made a beeline towards our food. We fought them off without much opposition, but their lack of concern for our presence was startling. I'm glad to be in the hammock tonight and away from the hungry rats in the shelter.","Mountaineer Shelter

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529278,"Before I came out here to hike, a friend of mine gave me a book to read. The Last American Man is the story of Eustace Conway and his primitive/rogue lifestyle. The story tells of all of his adventures from hiking the AT with almost no gear or clothing, to floating down the Mississippi River in a handmade canoe, and setting a record for the fastest Atlantic to Pacific crossing of America by horse and buggy. This man had lived his life by chasing adventure and existing as one with what the natural world provided to him. He was not just surviving through all of this, he was coexisting. All of his adventures were made possible by simply making use of all that the earth provided to him. I soon found out that this man was the subject of a History Channel series entitled, ""Mountain Men."" I was intrigued by this man and his perspective on life, so I decided to look into arranging to meeting him.While on my extended stay in Hot Springs, I had sent an email to his homestead, Turtle Island, to inquire about a visit to the property. Eustace has dedicated his life to living off of his own intellect, and sharing that information with anyone interested in learning more about that lifestyle. His homestead is settled in the hills of Boone, North Carolina away from the modern world. During my stay at Crazy Larry's, Eustace called me and told me that if I was willing to put in the work necessary, he would teach me to live as he has for the majority of his life. With this opportunity available to me, there was no way I could refuse. So the next day, I arranged for a ride to bring me 45 miles east to Boone.The ride through the Blue Ridge mountains offered panoramic views not too different from home. There were rolling hills of green covered in old homes, fields filled with livestock and country stores speckled along the roadside. Snow had fallen the night before and dusted the tops of the higher hills off in the distance. My driver, also named Larry, shared with me a little about his life. He had married a Cherokee woman and they settled on the banks of a creek filled with clean mountain water and enough brook trout to feed him and his family. They grew peach trees to make jellies and gardened their preferred vegetables to sustain themselves. It was an appropriate segue into the philosophy of Turtle Island. After driving through the tiny main street of Boone and down the main drag, we pulled off onto a long country road called Little Laurel. We followed this road for 5 miles through the country arriving at a dirt road with a ""dead end"" sign posted to a tree. A large, handmade wooden sign hanging over the road read, ""Turtle Island Preserve."" There was other official signage stating that visitors must pre schedule their visit in order to respect the privacy of the preserve. Larry and I made our way down the steep dirt road in his old Jeep Cherokee. The road was bumpy and infinitely steep. As we dropped down into the wooded valley, the hills grew taller on our sides. Rivers and water falls surged not too far from the road and had carved out steep cliffs alongside of us.It was as if the Jeep had allowed us to travel back in time, to a simpler America. Numerous buildings constructed from full sized trees and covered with thick wooden shingles lined the dirt road. Fields covered in lush green fields were filled with chickens roaming freely. Among the other livestock were goats, horses and ponies. High up in a tree in the middle of this village, was an old and weathered boat shaped treehouse. This is where I was instructed to meet Eustace. The first of many instructions I was intended to receive.Larry helped me unload my gear and expressed his concern for climbing back up the dirt road out of the preserve. We said our goodbyes and I watched as the dust clouds poured off the back of his vehicle. Once the hum of his engine, and the crunching of his tires faded into the distance, I was engulfed in silence. Silence of the modern world at least. The roosters called out and echoed off the landscape. A babbling stream flowed below various wooden bridges leading to an outdoor kitchen. There was a large stone chimney at the center and a large roof along the entire stretch. Jars filled with pastas, boxes of potatoes and onions filled the shelves along with various cooking utensils. There were large cast iron cauldrons hanging from wooden tripods over open fire pits. The stoves were fueled by burning wood rather than gas or electricity. In all of the time I had spent working in food service, a kitchen like this had never crossed my path. All of the tools were there, but the methods were clearly different. I looked across the field and saw an old red Toyota pickup with a wooden bed barreling down the road. It rattled and knocked as it worked over the bumps. The truck came to a skidding halt and the door opened. A man with long grayish blonde braids and a matching beard emerged. He worked his way swiftly around the back of truck to greet me.Eustace Conway stretched out his arms to hug me. ""Andy! My brother! So glad to have you!"" Eustace explained to me that we would be headed over to a property of his that he was renovating. As we drove back up the hill I couldn't help but wonder how he managed to make it up this hill. On the ride into town, we started bond about the trail. He shared a few stories with me about his southbound journey and how it had changed his life. We pulled up to a gas station and as he got out, the guys in the car across the pump came over. They were elated that it was actually ""The Mountain Man"" in person. As they took turns snapping photos with my new friend, I took the time to feed the little white baby goat sitting at my feet. Jenkins was a little white baby goat, only a few weeks old. He had been harassed by the other baby goats and rejected by the mother, so he had been isolated to give him a chance to grow. My first duty given to me was to periodically feed him with a baby bottle filled with goat's milk. As the goat sat on my lap drinking the bottle, I couldn't help but feel completely enthralled by my exit from my comfort zone. We drove together down the scenic Blue Ridge Parkway where I could catch a great third party glimpse of the hills I had been walking over the past week or so. Eustace pulled the truck off down a little dirt road leading to the old house we were to be working at for the day.The house, newly purchased by Eustace, was the definition of a ""fixer upper."" I could tell that he had already put a good amount of work into the little building. We unloaded a few old pieces of lumber that we were going to use for the porch. I helped to build a larger frame around the outside of the wooden porch and we laid out about 150 bricks over the top. We also used big beams of raw Locus wood, still with the bark on it, to replace the old supports for the roof of the porch. Over the course of this 6 hour project I learned the fine details of what we were doing. I was the right and wrong ways to use the different tools and the theory behind each piece of wood and its importance to the structure. Eustace was incredible thorough and left no detail out. I was assigned different small tasks as well. We pulled every single nail out of the old boards we were using, and recycled the non bent ones for later use. As we worked together, the two of us began joking about his tv show. I poked fun at him for the incident at the gas station and called him ""superstar."" I personally have only seen the show once. But it was intriguing to me to see how this man was outside of the tv persona. I think he appreciated my perspective and the fact that I knew him from a biography about him rather than a reality tv show. When we returned to Turtle Island, I was given a set of everyday chores. It was how I was to start my day, and how I was to end it. These chores consisted of feeding the various animals around the property. I was given my own little Toyota, similar to Eustace's for the job. The first order of duty was to relocate the pony on his stake around the grassy parts between the buildings at ""base camp."" He explained to me that the pony, Little Joe, was basically a big, hungry lawn mower, and the goal was to keep him eating grass that we wanted to be shorter. After the pony, we moved onto the horses. I was lead up to the top of the browsing shed where there were about a dozen large hay bails stored. We grabbed our pitchforks and began tossing hay into the holes positioned over the top of the trough. As I set my pitchfork back on the hook I saw a chicken sitting on eggs nestled in the hay. The next order of business was to move the billy goat, Charles. It was the same concept with the goat as it was the pony. We had to keep moving him around on the stake so that he had grass to eat. The black and white goat had a large curly set of horns that made him look more devilish than he actually was. In all reality, the goat was quite unshaded by me and just wanted to be moved to more food.We jumped in the truck together and drove down the dirt road to the hog pen. I had heard of hogs this big, but never actually seen one in person. She was roughly the size of a relationship riding lawn mower, but more solid and rounded. A little footbridge led over a stream where there were buckets of compost from local restaurants. I was told to pour in a buckets worth and watched while the hog devoured this tear inducing stench. We moved further down the road passing the lumber shed, a three story building filled with homemade lumber. There was a sawmill off to the right with a saw blade bigger than a kitchen table. Piles of drying, fresh cut lumber were neatly stacked around this entire section of the property. Eventually we came to the goat pasture. There were 4 white adults, a darker pigmy adult and 7 babies all scattering in different directions as we walked in through the wooden gates. In the middle of the goat dwelling was a roofed area with milking stations and a large rusted ice box. There were old horse buggies under which all of the baby goats would hide. The ice box was filled with all of the feed and vitamins I was to give the goats each day, along with their share of hay. The fences around this area allowed them to go down to the stream and drink as they pleased so watering wasn't necessary. This entire property was clearly designed around the benefits of the various streams flowing through.","Damascus

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529276,"I woke up around 8 today with the babbling of the river behind me. The winter gear is slowly shedding away as the warmth of the spring moves in. I used to sleep with fleece pants, big thick wool socks, my bag liner, coat and base layers. This was the first 3-4 weeks of the trail. But now I can sleep with the rain cover off of my hammock so I can see the stars above me on a clear night. The extra layers have left my sleep system and my pack altogether.Learning Curve, Optimistic Dreamer and Baby Chicken were sitting around the fire drinking coffee when I first woke up. I first woke at 7, but decided to take the hour to just appreciate the warmth and comfort of my ""bed."" When we moved out of camp, there was a detour due to a bridge being out. The river wasn't small enough to ford so the route of the AT had been changed all together. We walked alongside of a wide mountain river and eventually gained elevation. As we rose up above the water, it's voice became quieter. We worked up a long, steep climb with switchbacks. The valley below us came into view. Little farm houses and perfectly squared off fields dominated the landscape. As we went higher, the tops of the hills around us became part of the scenery rather than a towering opposition from a view. I made my way to the Saunders shelter around 10:30 to make my oatmeal and coffee. It's an easy combination to make as it requires very little effort. This is good for me in the morning when my motivation to do anything other than hike is non existent. Learning Curve went up the hill to get better service to call his father. I went downhill from the shelter to the water source. There were 3 deer down by the spring when I arrived. I took a couple of minutes to savor this truly unique experience. Only 30 ft off from me, the deer went about their business. The overwhelming human presence in their habitat has caused them to lose their inherent fear of us.We left the shelter and worked over the ridge line. Groups of hikers came southbound, all of them greeting us with friendly smiles and intrigue. It's too early for them to be SOBO hikers, and their admiration of us lead me to assume they were sectioning. I guess it's pretty easy to spot a thru hiker when we come by. Our weathered appearance and steady strides are easily recognizable. We stopped a couple of hours later to snack by a green algae filled pond. Learning Curve and I decided it would be a good thing to stick together through as much of VA as possible. I enjoy hiking with him as he challenges me. He hikes hard and never lets up. We've both struggled to get going after Damascus so I believe that we can bounce good energy off of one another and make it through together.The plan is to get up to 25 miles a day again and keep it steady there. Assuming that can be done, we'll make it out of VA in under a month. Once that's out of the way, we'll officially be at the halfway mark. It's hard seeing all of our friends names in the log books. Most people we know are anywhere from. 5-15 days ahead. I don't regret getting off trail for the week, but it sure us thrown me off a bit. Our bubble was bound to burst eventually, I'm just happy to have a friend to go along with. It's a good thing.We fell short of our 25 mile mark by a considerable amount. We were only able to put up 12 miles. It's sad because I've gone from a 44 mile day, to hardly over 10. But I learned this virtue at the beginning of the trail; listen to your body and it will be good to you. It's ok to push a little harder than what's comfortable, but injuries as small as blisters will only contribute to more setbacks. This is a retraining/toughening phase. To give ourselves credit, we did have over 3000 ft of elevation today. It's just hard because a they hiker's perspective is jaded once we see big miles. My patience will pay off, and I know it's time to rest. Tomorrow we will push and shoot for the 25 again, and we'll do it together.I lay in my hammock tonight overlooking the valley below. The sun set earlier off to our right and the moon is pouring white light through my bug screen. There is no rain cover over me on this warm and clear night. Just the stars, the lights from homes below and the crackle of the fire off to my side.","Camp Near Damascus
",Off Whitetop Mountain,"Apr 18, Mon",12.50
Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532391,"After breakfast, Learning Curve and I headed out from our campus on the side of Whitetop Mountain. When we made it up to the top, there were a handful of other hikers around soaking up the views. A little ways down from the summit was a spring with a flow that pumped like a draining fire hydrant. I took the opportunity to wash up with some soap and let the icy mountain spring water run over my hair. As we continued walking, I noticed an abundance of ramps coming up on the mountain side. After convincing Learning Curve that he wouldn't instantly die from eating them, we put a handful in our lunch. Tuna, tortilla and wild ramp made for a nice combination. Fresh greens are hard to come by, and it doesn't get much fresher than picked 5 minutes beforehand. We eventually climbed our way up Mount Rogers. The AT doesn't run over the summit, so we declined to take the side trail that lead to it. Eventually, we came to the entrance of the Grayson Highlands, notorious for the wild ponies that roam the land. The ponies were put in place to control vegetation on the balds so that the Grayson Highlands would remain in tact and not become over grown.Before we ran into any ponies though, we did meet up with an older German woman in her eighties. She had through hiked in 1992 and completed a triple crown not long after. In addition to those achievements, she had hiked all over the Alps and Nepal. She imparted on us some words of wisdom, predominantly the advantages of carrying a map with you. She gave us some homemade cookies and we were on our way.We stopped at a large rock outcrop to rest our feet. I've picked up a case of athlete's feet and it's been a struggle to put up the big miles. After my week off, I'm working to get my mojo back. They say only a few days off can throw off your hike. Taking a week off wasn't the smartest decision, but the adventure was well worth it. So now I suffer the consequences and have my mind wanting the big miles, but my body not responding. Each day out here gets easier though, and I expect to be back to normal within the week. We made it to the edge of the Grayson Highlands Park without seeing any ponies at all. And then, right at the 500 mile mark, there they were. A herd of about 10 wild ponies stood grazing in a field near a rock outcrop. It was like they were there to congratulate us. I couldn't resist the cliche moment to listen to ""Wild Horses"" by The Rolling Stones. I walked through the ponies, petting one that came up to me. As I did I sang the chorus to the song substituting ""wild ponies"" for ""wild horses.""We retired to the Wise Shelter at the end of the day. Learning Curve had explained to me that he did a series of practice hikes through the Grayson Highlands before he came out to start his thru hike. The Wise Shelter was the first shelter he had stayed in on the AT so it held some serious significance to him. But this time, he had walked 500 miles to be there. We set up our gear and had dinner with a few of our new friends. Eventually, Baby Chicken and OD showed up and set up camp across the shelter from us. That night, I went to bed watching the moon circle over my head. When I woke up at 4am, it had already completely gone across the sky. That was my entertainment for the evening. I have to say, waking up to the full moon is far better than waking up to infomercials running on your tv on an endless repeat at 4am...","Off Whitetop Mountain

And so I remember every face, of every man who put me here.I see my light come shining from the west down to the east. Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.""------Hiking this trail on a good day is hard enough. But hiking when you're hurting inside, it is a gauntlet that could break even the toughest of human beings. Sometimes I wonder if I made the right decision to come out here, other times I wonder if I'm cut out for this challenge that I set out before myself. I keep my faith rested in the belief that the trail will provide so long as patience and persistence prevail. The timing for me was perfect. I'm young, have minimal real life responsibilities, and few obligations to hold me back. Yet, I can't help but feel as if I'm abandoning people that I love and care for. And of course you say, ""Abandoning?! You're only out for a few months!""Yes it sounds overdramatized when simplified to that perspective. All I can offer as an explanation is that there are certain aspects of this journey that will stay out of the public forum. I do my best to be as honest as possible, and as thorough as I can, but some privacy must stay in tact. The material possessions were easy to do away with and can certainly be replaced in time. I gave up my apartment, my home, to create a new home out here on the trail. I have no idea what I'll be coming back to, but I have faith it will work itself out. There are of course the personal relationships sacrificed to be here. It's not all gone with the wind, but it's incredibly difficult for me not to be available for the people I care about most. Phone calls are always helpful, and FaceTime is a miracle in itself. I've never been away from home this long and I struggle with that regularly. I've always wanted to explore the world and see what was out there, but of course that adventure leads you far from home from time to time. Each day inches me closer to those Berkshire Hills. I had always heard about the ""Virginia blues"" but had just assumed they would find me later on down the road.There's no need for alarm, this journey will continue. But I feel that it is my duty in these entries to maintain integrity and honesty, and let you all know that this trail is a bottomless pit of difficulty. It's not always sunny with the birds singing their happy songs. Sometimes melancholy is the mode of the day. This is still reality, and the outside world plays on while we all wander through the Green Tunnel. Every single day poses a series of trials. If this were easy, everyone would be out here doing it, and I certainly would not be. The challenge is what draws us all to the trail, the accomplishment drives us through the pain in each step. There is beauty out here some will never see, and for one reason, it has to be earned.So for now I leave you with the image of me, sitting on top of a field in the sky, surrounded by wild ponies and horses; the grass green and yellow and the landscape reminiscent of an old sepia tone photograph. These are the memories we cherish as thru hikers, but believe me, all of that walking is no filler. It is an ocean of self reflection and infinite discovery. All you have to do is take that first step and see for yourself.","Wise Shelter
",Trimpi Shelter,"Apr 20, Wed",20
Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529698,"I'm slowly falling back into the routine of putting up mileage. It was discouraging at first to feel like I wasn't doing what I was able to do only a week prior. But in all reality, I'm doing the same mileage now that I've been working at it for the past week. Mentally though, there is still a block. My suspicion is my one big mile day threw me off. I'm just going to backtrack here for a second...The day I came into Damascus, I walked 42 miles from Watauga Lake Shelter to town. Yes 42 miles all in the same day. It took nearly everything I had, but it was done. Why? My food supply was nearly exhausted, my phone had been dead 3 days so I couldn't talk to anyone on the ""outside"" and I pretty much just wanted to see how far I could push it. This was the longest I had ever hiked and it definitely got a rise out of my little hiking community. I felt accomplished and was content with getting off the trail to go to Turtle Island. If I had not done that big mile day, I know that getting on trail would've been much easier for me. If I had walked 20 miles into Damascus, walking under 10 out of it wouldn't have been so bad. This has been a small part of my struggle. As I mentioned in the last entry, I'm coming into some serious homesickness, coupled with a realization of the task at hand. It's not that I didn't realize what this hike would entail, I just believe that I had convinced myself to not to get wrapped up in the details because it was so overwhelming. I've simplified this entire trail as just walking, not stopping and walking more. As I wandered the trail today, I began to drift back to this fall when I was challenged by my own perception of success.Last September I was out with my friends at Richmond pond. As they fished the waters, I went for a swim. I swam across the entire pond, a mile, maybe more, through open water. It was farther than I had ever swam before, and it was definitely not one of my wisest decisions. The water was incredibly deep, more like a lake than a pond. But for some reason I needed to overcome this challenge. I suspect that I needed to accomplish a task that everyone said was too much, too far and a little crazy. Catch where I'm going with this?But it wasn't as simple as just swimming across. The first half was easy. I just swam. My friends became farther and farther out of sight. The mountains that surrounded us came into sight as I reached the middle of the waters. The leaves were beginning to change into their autumn colors and the sun was still strong. Everything was perfect. I was high on adrenaline and on the idea of doing something I had never done before. But then, reality hit me. Once I realized I was actually fully immersed in this feat, I panicked. My heart began racing, I told myself I was going to drown, I pictured the 40' of dark water below me and chastised myself for my arrogance and stupidity. All of these vivid images flooded my mind and I froze up. Now what happened next sounds cheesy and over the top, but I swear to you that it happened. A bald eagle flew right over the top of me. I was so shocked to get such a close look at this massive raptor, that it pulled my mind out of the abyss. I kind of chuckled to myself about how perfect the moment was. So I swam on, and I made it. I guess you can say right now I'm looking for another bald eagle; a symbol that I'm going to make it. It took more than a symbol to get me through my swim, but it helped me to reevaluate my situation. If I had not stopped to collect my feelings and take charge of what was happening, I probably wouldn't be around to share the story with you. It's an incredibly morbid thought, but that's the reality of it. My hike isn't life or death, but rather finish or quit. And just like my swim, it's up to me to make sure I see the other side. Right now all I can do is just keep swimming, just keep swimming.","Campsite Near Crawfish Trailhead

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532379,"I got up today around 7:30 and the entire camp was deserted. There must've been 15 people at the shelter when I went to bed, and they had all left before I woke up. I must've missed the memo. I'm not a huge fan of getting up early unless it's absolutely necessary. As long as I make my miles for the day, I'm fine with sleeping in. Thanks to the new suspension system Learning Curve gave me, I save about 10 minutes on my set up/breakdown for the day. He gave me a set of whoopie slings that he handmade using some lengths of Dynaglide. To sift through the jargon; he gave me a pair of really thin, ultra strong adjustable ropes that I hang my hammock from. All I do now is attach a rope around two trees, tie a few simple knots, and I'm good to go. This morning I was able to have everything packed up in 20 minutes which has got to be a record. I hit the trail around 8 and made some great mileage. This terrain, while reasonably flat, has been particularly challenging for one major reason, water. Last night, we climbed 2000' up to a beautiful shelter with views all around us. But the water had to be brought up from the bottom of the mountain. So the 2 liters I brought up had to get me to the top, cook dinner and breakfast, and then see me off to the next source in the morning. Unfortunately the next source was the only one thereafter for the next 10 miles. I make a point to camel up at each source I come to. What that means is that I drink until I feel like I'm going to explode, and then I fill up my bottles to carry with me.After 15 miles I came to a beautiful river at the bottom of a strong decent. After crossing the footbridge, I walked down to a rock in the middle of the river where I laid in the sun for 20 minutes and drank as much water as I could. The sun has been strong the past few days, so a day with limited sources of water is a challenging one. I came to a campsite immediately after the river. Unfortunately the campsite is right on the side of VA 615, a fairly busy dirt road that works through the hills. I'm usually apprehensive to camp so close to the roads because of the heavy traffic. Let's just put it this way, I feel safer sleeping in the middle of the woods than I do next to a roadway in an area I'm not familiar with. When I got here, my friend Red Bear was laying in his hammock reading The Hobbit. I haven't seen him since we walked into Damascus together on that massive mile day.Together, Red Bear and I walked 20 miles through the night to get to Damascus. I guess you could say he's something of a ""nightwalker."" The majority of his hiking is done at night while everyone else is sleeping. He was a large part of the reason I made it through that challenging day. Though his pace is a tad bit different from mine, his high spirits and good conversation helped push me through. After catching up for awhile around the campfire, he set off at sunset to do his day's hiking. I'm sure I'll catch him again some night on the trail. I'm content with my 15 miles today. It was my goal to get a little more, but as long as I keep 15 miles a day, I'm on par to finish this journey within the time frame I've planned. Tomorrow, I've set out an 18.5 mile day that will put me roughly 5 miles out from my bounce box waiting for me, along with another package, at Trent's Grocery Store in Bland. The plan from there is to grab a good sub from the deli, grab a day or so worth of food, and then make it to Pearisburg where I have a full resupply waiting for me. The goal is to be there, 45 miles down the road, by Friday morning at the absolute latest.I'm trying my best to settle back into attainable mileage goals from day to day. As I mentioned in my past entry, my perception of a reasonable days worth of hiking has been skewed. But the formula is this; try to do at least 18 miles a day for the next 3 weeks and I'll be out of Virginia. I'm already over 100 miles in, so I know it's doable. Now that my Virginia Blues have come and passed in large part, I'm ready to go forward. At mile 750, the middle of Virginia, I'll be exactly half way home. Then once I finish this state, I'll be at Harper's Ferry West Virginia, the halfway mark of the trail. The momentum is in full swing, all I have to do is buckle down and hang in there for the ride.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530905,"Since I bought my hammock/tent system I've been struggling with staying dry in full on rain. Every time the water comes, I cross my fingers. That's pretty much the entire function of a shelter system, so it was imperative that I find a way to stay dry. Back around mile 100 or so I bought an ENO Profly. It was entirely functional as it provided tons of dry room to set my gear up under, and it saved me in that snow storm in the smokies. But unfortunately, it was heavy and bulky so it had to go. More room in the pack is more food in my pack.Now, since my hammock doesn't have an awning like most hammocks do I've had to work out a few kinks. My rain cover is a silnylon tarp that clips around the outside of the system similarly to a pack cover. The problem that I was having was that there was about a 2"" gap on each side of the hammock that allowed rain to get in if it was windy outside.Because of all the rain we've been getting lately I decided it was time to really address the issue.What I've found are tiny little cloth tabs right before the spot where I clip the fly onto. Now you at home may be saying, ""Well, what an idiot! If the tabs were there, why not use them?""Believe me, I'm right there with you on that one. This hasn't been the first time out here that I've had a full realization of my complete ignorance on an issue. I digress. Essentially, these tabs alter the way that the frame of the hammock sits underneath the rain tarp. It pulls the poles in tighter so that the rainfly can cover all of the hammock. So now, rather than laying in a hammock under a tarp, I'm fully engulfed in a complete cocoon. I wish I had known this in the cold weather because it's much warmer in here without the cold air rushing in. Maybe the condensation will be less of an issue in the morning as well. The downside to this huge victory, the airflow is more restricted. If I make it through the night to report back to you tomorrow, then we can chalk it up to a success.Last night, to avoid the rain completely, I slept in the shelter. I know as a hiker I'm supposed to be completely down with grungy situations and the stank as we call it, but there are just a few problems with shelters for me. The first is the rodents. Whether they are mice or big fat rats, they're the last thing you want crawling over your face at 3 in the morning. They will chew through your gear, nestle into your hair, poop all over your stuff and keep you up all nights with their scurrying about the wooden surfaces of the shelter.The second issue is sleeping on the hard wooden decking. I just can't get the rest I need when I'm sleeping so flat on such a hard surface. The surfaces are clean though. There's always a broom to clean the dirt off, but years of oils from greasy, sweaty hikers have added a distinct black varnish to every single board of every shelter.The third issue for me is all of the other people around you in a shelter. There's snoring all night, rustling of sleeping bags, scratching of body parts, readjusting of positions, people getting up to go to the bathroom etc. All personal privacy gets tossed right out the window. The shelters are wonderful to have in an emergency situation though. I'd rather be under a wooden structure in a nasty wind storm than in a nylon system any day.All day long I've kind of been in a funk over some of the dark side of AT history. I'll set a link aside to the article I read earlier while eating my sub at Trent's Grocery store. I wish I had paid a little more attention to the details though. As I read through the story once more before bed, I have no idea why, I realized that the site of a gruesome double homicide was in fact at the shelter I'm sleeping at tonight. Lightning doesn't strike twice right? Read the article and tell me that this isn't the last place you'd want to be in a thunderstorm. Poe couldn't have written a more terrifying scenario himself. Should've done my research before settling in...http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/08/AR2008070801657.html","Jenny Knob Shelter

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530901,"Today it rained. Tomorrow it will rain again. That's just the way it goes. Virginia has challenged me greater than any part of the trail, and to a degree, more so than anything else in my life. Maybe it's just the way things have worked out. But I sit smack dab in the middle of a perfect storm of SNAFU's and sour circumstance. To add to my slew of mental obstacles, I now face technical problems. First, my tent failed and water started to seep in during a thunderstorm. I woke up soaking wet as rain water slid down the inside of my hammock and pooled up at my back. I've contacted the company, and it looks as though they are going to send me a rainfly. Unfortunately, 5 days of nonstop rain stands between me and the location they have sent the tarp to. For now, I try to shelter hop and hope that they aren't full when I get there. Stop early to guarantee a space in a closer shelter? Or, make the miles and hope that there's room in the shelter up ahead?At the start of the Pearisburg-Daleville stretch, the gasket to my water filter was swept downstream. It has beed rendered utterly useless until I can get to a hardware store and buy a couple of them. Luckily, I packed emergency water purification tablets. They take 30 minutes to neutralize and taste like pool water coming out of a hot plastic cup. To cut down on weight and bulk, I sent my sleeping bag home when I was in Pearisburg. I dropped 4.5 pounds out of my pack, the sleeping bag being the bulk of this. It was overkill for what I need in this season, and I woke up sweaty every night. Now of course with the rainy weather, it has been chilly. Even wearing all of my layers, and wrapping in my insulated sleeping bag liner, I still wake up cold every night. A full resupply package sent from my mother back home has managed to elude me since Damascus. I arranged in Damascus to have it sent up to Pearisburg. When I got to Pearisburg, no package. It was still in Damascus. Now I've had to bounce that to Daleville. I made a desparation attempt at a disgustingly cheap resupply to get me the 80 miles or so between towns. 3 pounds of plain oatmeal, 2 six pack bricks of beef flavored ramen noodles, 2 bags of instant garlic mashed potatoes and 1 jar of peanut butter...$11, 80 miles. Start walking. As I sat at a $6 Chinese food buffet in Pearisburg, I vented to a friend about how every aspect of this journey was seemingly falling apart.""Nah"" he said, ""This is the part where it gets good.""Another good friend gave me some of the best advice I've received yet, ""Little things gain enormous importance when you're alone.""This surely put me in my place. Somehow, I let this trip make me feel as if I had to be out here. After all of the sacrifices I made, there was no way I could go home without success. Eventually, this snowballed into a hatred for every step. A feeling of being trapped in the woods came upon me. Rather than being liberated in the wilderness and living out my dream adventure, I was bitter enough to feel trapped. I found comfort in the rain as I walked in silence through fields and forests, up and over mountains and along rocky ridge lines.All of this resentment that I harbored towards the trail. What happened? I loved this in the planning and at the start. I worked so hard to make this a possibility, and others helped a great deal as well. How could I be so selfish and actually not want to be out here? What had I sacrificed and what has been taken?These thoughts raced through my head as I trudged through the rain. The sky was all the same pale gray color and a light drizzle soaked everything in my possession. My feet were covered in sores from my aging shoes and a perpetual soggy state. They ached from 8 weeks of abuse. Every step pain, resentment, pain resentment. I worked my way into a cycle of anger. As I came down from Kelly Knob, I ran into a group of day hikers from Virginia Tech who took my photo and told me how inspired they were by through hikers. I laughed to them and told them I was honored, but still very much working on inspiring myself. 12 miles into the day, the rain began to come down in sheets. I stopped at the top of my 1100' ascent to change into my rain gear. I managed to put on an old album that made me feel content with this environment. Then my phone died. Stripped of luxuries like music, and necessities like food, water and shelter, I was defeated. I crawled under a large rock and sat shivering in the cold, water running all over me. I ate uncooked ramen and drank my pool water as I looked out into the soaked hollow before me; twisted vines the size of my arms, ancient moss covered piles of rocks from farms years ago and apple trees aged just as well. Lacking my security blanket, my music, I was as vulnerable as I could be for that breaking moment. I crawled out from under this rock, literally and quite metaphorically I might add, and continued on listening only to the rain. I soon stood before the Eastern Continental Divide. Here, water on the west side of the mountain flows to the Gulf of Mexico, water on the east side flows to the Atlantic. This ridge line was ancient. The Appalachian range is among the oldest mountains on earth. Here, at this exact point I could feel that age. Billions of years had passed right before the very rock formations I walked over. I imagined these rocks slamming into one another over an eternity as they grew taller in formation and then receded by erosion. I picked every step with extreme precision. These eroded boulders were slick from the day's rain, and to fall, well that was not a desirable option. To slide down these rocks would mean a 60' almost straight down slide. As I looked forward for more white blazes on the rocks, I could see the clouds rolling up and over my path ahead. The wind whistled in my ears while water continued to slap against me. Each step was labored and slow. To my left, an abyss of nothingness, to my right the same. I was not walking, just simply being allowed to exist on this other worldly and ancient plane. I had managed to catch a glimpse into some of the earliest portions of the planet's history. It was as if I was the first human on earth. Being deprived of what little commodities I had, humbled me like nothing else has ever humbled me. I had been reduced to rubble by the trail, and because of that sacrifice, I was allowed to see it in its elemental state. As I stepped off that ridge line, the change in environment was instantaneous. Lush green forest stood between me and the shelter below. The storm had passed and I was again at peace on the Appalachian Trail.","War Spur Shelter

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533227,"Still fighting the rain. It seems that there has been at least some chance of precipitation in the forecast for awhile now. But I'm a pro at this, and all of the issues I faced last week have been resolved. Clark Jungle Hammocks sent me an awning to put over the top of my hammock. They were incredibly professional and did right by me. It took me about 3 hours the other day to set up the awning. I had cut and measure the proper cordage for the outriggers, and play around with it to see how it worked. It weighs 14 oz and is about half the size of an AT shelter, no joke. It's amazing. When I arrived in Daleville about 5 days ago, I ran into my friend Sneaky Pete. Pete was the first hiker I met when I stepped out of the car at Amicolola Falls my first day on trail. He lives in the town of Roanoke, only a 20 minute drive from Daleville. He offered to bring me back to his place where there were 20 other hikers hanging out. He considered it his trail magic to the community. Being that it was May 4th, Star Wars Day, we all gathered around the tv to watch the new Star Wars film. I zeroed the next day at his house watching 3 more episodes of Star Wars, the originals of course. It was a marathon, but I had my pals Spike and Napster from Germany to watch every episode with me. On that zero day, I ate as much food as I possibly could shovel in. I also made my way out to pick up a 50° fleece sleeping bag for $12 at a sporting goods store in Roanoke. Not a bad deal at all. It only weighs a pound and is great to cozy up with at night. I finally picked up the resupply package that had been lost in the mail for a month. That was waiting for me in Daleville. I grabbed some tree straps to hang my hammock from. Unfortunately, I left the straps I was using tied up around two trees on Mcaffee's Knob, so I had no way to hang my hammock until I grabbed these. While in Glasgow this morning, I picked up a package of hose gaskets for my Sawyer. With a surplus of about 6 gaskets, I'm banking on not having to drink water with my emergency water treatment again. I had a chance to fully resupply, and this time I've packed enough food to keep me going strong for 5 days, potentially 4 if I'm really tearing into it. All in all, things are looking pretty decent out here for me. I'm good under pressure, and a seasoned problem solver, but I let the trail get into my head. It's hard to explain the relationship I have with this trail so far, but I can sum it up as one of respect. I respect the trail because I know it can break me. But it will only break me if I allow it to do so.","Waynesboro

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532286,"Family and friends. We often hear these two grouped together whenever serious gratitude is due. But let me really take some time to explain what my family and friends mean to me in my life, and in my journey. This journey, to me, consists of reflection, perception and strengthening. Without the love of everyone around me, this would be impossible. My family. I have two amazing parents that wound up with me in their laps when they were younger than I am at this very moment. My parents always gave me space to make my own decisions, while still guiding me along the way to make the right choices. I was given a home where I had the opportunity to fall in love with nature, and a park behind our house that was the setting for every adventure of my youth. As I walk along the trail each day, I know that it was the hours spent on the trails, and in the woods, of Springside Park, that fueled my passion for all that I am surrounded in every day on the Appalachian Trail. Always along for the adventure was my little sister. Even when I was a complete jerk, she stood by my side and explored with me. Now we are adults, and embark on another phase of life's adventures.Because of my mother and father's parents, my creative outlets were sculpted. My grandparents on both sides always encouraged me to dream. When I dreamed of being a musician, my grandfather gave me instruments to bang away at and took the time to show me what ""good taste in music"" really meant. I would go out and listen to him sing and play and hope that one day I could be brave enough to stand up and do the same. Eventually, that music was my tool to confidence. My grandmother recognized my passion for the woods and brought me along on hikes, to bird sanctuaries to learn about wildlife and always passed along books on everything there was to know about taking a stroll into the woods. From this, I learned to respect the natural world; take nothing for granted. On my father's side, my grandparents provided a place to wander on my own. I could catch frogs and crayfish, and chase ducks until they turned around and chased me back. My grandmother taught me the art of relaxation and patience. She understood my love for reading and always encouraged me to read more. We spent time drinking tea and playing croquet as if we were members of high society. She taught me not to worry, although I admittedly do so far too much. My grandfather taught me what hard work really meant. He always supported my pursuit of education, encouraged me to do well in school and gave me all of the tools I needed to reap the benefits of a hard day's work. One could say, I was given grit. My extended family consists of cousins, more like brothers and sisters, that would go to the end and back with me. My aunts and uncles, for that matter, great aunts and great uncles, we're all so diverse that there was no way I could not learn something new every time I visited one of their homes. So now my friends. There are the friends that I grew up with. The ones who know where I came from, and how I got to this point. They are the ones who bail you out when life gives you everything it's got all at once, and the one's who ride the storm out with you, right by your side. The relationships fall right into place like not a day passed in between. There are the friends that I work with. The people I spend more hours of the week with than anyone else. The people that make going into work an experience to look forward to. To you guys, I owe infinite thanks for your wise words of encouragement and endless support to see my success.New friends come into my life everyday out here on the trail. We all share the common goal out here and the struggles each day on the trail. At the end of the night, it means the world to be able to see a familiar face around the campfire. These bonds, while still young and growing, make the walk a little less lonely. We come into unfamiliar towns together, hungry and exhausted and stick together like a family. The trail family. We rely on each other to see through to the next day. When I first set foot on trail, I thought I had the big picture. I came out in search of strength and wisdom. I was looking for answers to questions I had. Now there are new questions posed. I walk in search of answers I may never find. The beauty in all of this? It's ok not to know, so long as you are willing to try and understand. Strength and wisdom are both infinite concepts to me. One can always seek to be stronger, both physically and emotionally. There is no end to the strength we can achieve, so long as we continue to seek it. Wisdom never reaches a paramount, it expands further and further until the day we die. Tomorrow we are wiser than yesterday.This trail isn't just about what happens each day to me while I wander around the green tunnel. It's about understanding how I got here, what keeps me going, and why the trail is a metaphor for the big picture of this thing we call ""life."" In my life I love my family and I love my friends. Displaced from them, I struggle everyday, but the AT, although isolating at times, never stops reminding you of all that truly matters. Thank you to everyone who continues to support me from back home.","Thunder Hill Shelter

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534137,"The rain continues, but I walk on. Someone today told me that we're going on 19 days straight with rain. It has cleared up time to time, but we have gotten wet 18 days in a row. In the past 3 days I've covered 60 miles. Tomorrow, I hit the Shenandoah's for some smooth sailing. The terrain now flattens out and changes. We won't see 4000' again until VT. It will be easier, but no part of this trail is easy. I've grown accustomed to this wet, humid environment. I don't prefer it by any means, but the struggle of the simplest day to day activities strengthens me. You can spend time trying to avoid the mud and getting your gear covered in slop, but really the best way to cope is to dive head first into that slop. I read in a book at a hostel the other day that these hikers called wet feet freedom. Why? Because freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose. The tip of the hat to Janis Joplin gave me a good smile, and I really can't agree more. I ran out of fuel for my stove last night. The logical solution, make a fire and cook over it, right? What do you do when it's raining and all of your wood is soaked? You make a fire or you go hungry. Like Yoda said, ""Do or do not. There is no try."" With all of my philosophical ranting in this journal, it was only a matter of time before I quoted the Yoda. So, for over an hour I struggled to get a fire going. I understood the basic concept, find the smallest pieces possible and as many as you can. In my experience fire building, you absolutely need to be prepared. All of your kindling and fuel have to be laid out right in front of you so that you can give the fire exactly what it needs at a consistent rate. All I could think about it is the project where the teacher sends you home with an egg, tells you to pretend it's a baby, and don't break it. To me, a fire is very much like that. When you depend on that fire, it is going to depend on you back to grow and be productive. After exploring different techniques, and failing quite a bit, I finally got it right. I took a small amount of toilet paper, covered it with hand sanitizer and stuck it over my kindling. The kindling was shavings from the inside of dry sticks that I had carved out with my knife. I cut away the wet parts, and used the dry inside portion to catch the flame. In time, I had enough of a fire to cook on. My instant mashed potatoes and Spanish rice might as well have been filet mignon. At many points, I contemplated giving up and going to bed hungry. It was taking too long, I had no idea what I was doing, and I was frustrated beyond belief. But what I thank the trail for is its way of providing those two options previously mentioned; do it or do not do it. There's always the option to be frustrated and walk away, but there is nothing to be gained from that. The advantages of this mentality, and overall ethic, will be more than beneficial off trail to me.This is one of the many reasons I am out here. This is what I learned today, and tomorrow I will be dealt another lesson from this great trail. But until then, I fall asleep and listen to the white noise of the rain falling through the leaves.","Hog Camp Gap
",Tye River,"May 14, Sat",19
Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534139,"Getting into camp late, and successfully setting up is dependent upon your confidence in your skills and the level of patience you have. Many refuse to do it because of the frustration involved. Finding the perfect spot is difficult when you walk into an area you know absolutely nothing about. But you can train yourself to pick up on certain factors that make that spot quickly identifiable so that you can set up as quickly and as effectively as possible. If you're camping at a shelter spot, then you're there for the water source and the privy, otherwise you can stealth camp on about 95% of the trail. When I first come in I identify where these are as well as where the shelter is. The shelter is where the majority of people will be gathered. I personally like to be away from this so that I can have privacy and not have to listen to 12 other people tossing, turning and snoring in the night. Once I've identified where I don't want to be then I note where the privy and water are so that I know when the time comes to utilize both of these sources. Next comes finding the little piece of land to call home for the night. I have the advantage of having a hybrid system. Yes it's heavier than most other systems people use out here, but I have affectionately begun to refer to it as, ""Chateau de Greyhound."" Hybrid means I can hammock or tent. When you tent you NEED a flat spot. Otherwise you are miserable all night rolling down an incline or trying to avoid that rock that seems to mysteriously move underneath you. When you hammock, you don't necessarily need a flat spot, although it helps. A level spot gives you somewhere to lay your gear without it rolling around on you. I can throw the hammock up over rocks, logs, streams and soggy ground in a pinch. Again not ideal, but doable. So with all of this in mind, all I need is two trees 12-18' apart, clear enough around to stretch out my rainfly, and I'm good to go. In their attempts to avoid the dark, the majority of hikers arrive into camp roughly an hour before dark so that they may be ready for bed. I have no problem with this, in fact yes, it's loads earlier to be set up by nightfall. Arriving late into camp is similar to being late for any event in life be it work, meetings or dinner plans. When you're late for something, you become derailed in the fluster of unpreparedness. This of course coming from the guy who's convinced that there's always more time to be had, and as a result, the guy who's always late. The downside to this approach though is developing a stringent routine. That is to say, if you're not awake at a certain time, then you can't be out of camp at a certain time, then you can't get your miles in before dark, so you can't go as far. I don't subscribe to this. If I want to wake up early and do some large mileage, then I do it. If I want to stay in my hammock until noon, and hike until midnight, then I do it. The AT is about reconnecting with basic human necessities and finding inner peace through nature. If you put yourself on a schedule, what liberation from the modern world are you offered?This is not to say that all routine has to go out the window. Putting things in the same spot in your pack, and setting up camp the same way each night are useful tools to ensure maximum productivity. But productivity means more times enjoying yourself on the trail.Even though the second you get into camp all you want to do is tear open your food bag and crumble to the ground, there's much more that needs to be done. Shelter needs to be set up, wet clothes hung out to dry, water for cooking needs to be gathered, and of course your bear bagging cord needs to be hung so that you're not fumbling in the dark to get it up on some precarious limb over head. Then, once all of this is done, you can eat. Tonight I came into camp just at dark. I left camp at 10:30 this morning and was still able to get in my 21 miles before dark. Yesterday I was able to trudge 25 through pouring rain and fog. It has been a bit disappointing to come to all of these side trails leading to vistas only to be let down by a blank white canvas of cloud cover. When I woke up, my clothes were still completely soaked. If you're interested recreating this situation I'll offer an experiment. With all of your clothes on, submerge yourself completely into a swimming pool. Proceed to walk 25 miles in those clothes making a nice big loop around your town. Take those wet clothes and put them in your refrigerator. Then in the morning, wake up, put those clothes on, and do it all again. These conditions aren't favorable, but just as with every lesson learned on the AT, knowing that you can is strength to walk away with.","Pinefield Shelter

Greyhound,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535063,"My last day in the Shenandoah National Park offered a climactic resolution to a week of rain and nothing but fog. After waking up in my tent later than expected, I took to the trail. Seeing family and having a dose of normality for the weekend, posed the familiar challenge of acclimating back into trail life. This was quickly disrupted when I walked right into a bear on trail. Standing not more than 10' in front of me, the bear and I were equally surprised to see one another. I laughed a nervously excited laugh the second I realized what was happening. I slowly backed away from the bear, and he from me. It was a mutually nonthreatening standoff between two beings alone in the wilderness. I took a good look at the bear from my new, more comfortable distance and realized that he was not going anywhere. The bears in the Park, like the deer, seem to have lost their inherent fear of humans. So I put my phone on loud and played Van Halen's ""Panama."" I'm not sure why this song, it just seemed to be the noisiest I could think of. I then cleared my throat loudly and the bear took off into the woods. Before he disappeared, I snapped one good picture as he looked back at me. Feeling renewed in my sentiment, I continued on.I soon made my way to Elkwallow Wayside, the last wayside before I left the park. Essentially, the wayside system is a touristy, overpriced, pit stop along Skyline Drive, the auto road through the Park. They offer a selection of groceries, souvenirs and food from the grille. While overpriced, the food provides hikers with a hot meal to supplement their nutrition in the middle of the day. I sat there in the sunshine enjoying a nice lunch as I savored the first bits of sun to penetrate the sky in days. I chatted with an older couple from Massachusetts, now living in Vermont, who both had worked for the AMC in the past. I also had the chance to meet a group of SOBO Flipfloppers. ""SOBO Flipfloppers."" How's that for jargon? Basically what's happening right now on trail is a flood of south bounders (SOBOs) departing from Harper's Ferry, the theoretical halfway mark for the Appalachian Trail. The little West Virginian town is also home to the Appalachian Trail Conference headquarters. This is a milestone, a massive milestone, for any AT hiker. The reason for the traffic, is people seeking a non traditional route to hike the AT in an effort to avoid the crowds. This is called a ""flip flop."" They start in the middle, hike to one terminus, and then either hike the opposite direction for Harper's, or from the opposite terminus, back to Harper's. These newbee hikers allowed me to reminisce about how far I've come along on the trail since I started. I got pretty sentimental as I gazed off into the distance and enjoyed my meal. All of the hardships and pleasures flooded back to me, while feeling quite seasoned as a thruhiker, I know that this journey is only half completed. Who knows what will be written in the second chapter.As the clouds rolled in and the temperature dropped, I felt a familiar feeling in the air, rain. The rain held off as I hiked, but I knew it was coming. I worked over the last 3000' peak that I will see until I reach Mt. Greylock back home. I can't help but feel ""the homestretch"" closing in. The terrain is much less challenging and I'm only a few weeks from hiking through my backyard. Again, sentimentality flooded my inner narrative as I walked along. Just as I came to the 2900' Compton Peak, it happened. The massive black cloud looming above let loose. Like a tidal wave sweeping through the leaf cover, the cold and heavy rain drops blasted me all at once. Instant torrential downpour. I looked up into the rain and began laughing. My reaction to curveballs on this trail is no longer anger or disbelief, but an elevated level of acceptance; an, ""of course"" attitude. The thunder rolled around me as I found myself in the wrong place at the wrong time for the fourth or fifth time in my travels. It seems I'm always on top of a high peak and hoping to avoid lightening. Then, as soon as it started, it stopped. There were a few volleys of hard rain, sputters if you will, before the waterworks were instantly turned off. I looked out over the cliffs and saw the storm moving slowly across the rest of the Shenandoahs, their peaks clouded and looming far off in the distance. The rain was behind me at last. At Compton Gap, I moved on to the last segment of the park. A nice flat walk lead me out. It was a wide, flat country road. Tall blades of grass flopped alongside the trail's edge. Each white blaze stood proudly on the wet bark of ancient trees. Everything was alive in the wake of the storm, the birds chirped and sang as night began to creep in. The sun exploded on the horizon in a deep fiery red, bathing all of the forest in red tint. The last bits of rainwater lingering above dripped off the leaves and fell to the forest floor in the breeze. As I walked along the road, I had just enough time to catch one last bear jump into the bushes. It was as if he were there to bid me farewell.Though not my home, West Virginia symbolizes a new hike for me. Virginia consumed me and spit me out raw. As a good friend told me early on in my Virginia Blues, ""Once you're raw, it's up to you to decide what happens next. Life right now is like a prism. White light goes in one end, and shoots out a spectrum on the other side. Some of the colors you see you may like. Other colors, maybe not. But once you're raw, it's up to you to decide.""It rained almost every single day that I was in Virginia, and I wouldn't trade it for any amount of sunshine. I've been tested in a way that has expanded my limits. I know now what I'm capable of. I know more of these trials await in the second half of this adventure, but right now, in this moment, I feel accomplished. I see myself changing, I have seen myself change. I left in the winter, and walk home with summer.""Almost heaven, West VirginiaBlue ridge mountains, Shenandoah riverLife is old there, older than the treesYounger than the mountains, growin' like a breezeCountry roads, take me homeTo the place I belongWest Virginia, mountain mommaTake me home, country roads.""","
