Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515546,"How does an overweight 50-year old math teacher get ready to hike two thousand miles with a pack up and down mountains?     I began a year ago by ""counting steps"". I used my I-phone app and tried to do 10,000 steps per day. I began to walk before school....during my free period.....during lunch....after school...and the steps began to add up. Before long, I was doing 20,000 steps per day, but I started to get blisters and my feet hurt. It got cold and snowy, but I found plowed bike paths and country roads to walk on. Soon, I was averaging four hours per day of walking. I learned that hiking boots caused me blisters, but I couldn't find anything else to wear that worked. My feet gained a whole shoe size after four months of hundred-mile weeks. My back hurt, so I began hiking with a hiking pole or two--it helped on the long walks. I learned to stretch more effectively to avoid back problems.    When the snow disappeared, I began to hike on trails and mountains. I learned that trail miles are much easier on the feet, but harder overall. It was like beginning my training all over again. In June, I began backpacking, only to discover that I had to begin all over AGAIN! Miles with a full pack were very difficult for me, especially when it was hot. My wife and I did most of the Massachusetts AT, the Pemi Loop (the whites), the Monadnock Sunapee Greenway, and the Midstate Trail (NH to RI). Finally, at the end of the summer, we did the 100-mile wilderness and Katadin.     Now summer's over and I'm back teaching math again. I am trying not to get out of shape by hiking the local mountain (Monadnock). My goal is to hike it 50 times before January 1st. Hiking the mountain often helps, but day hikes are not as good training as 5-day hikes. I am gaining weight and losing my momentum. However, the hardest part of the school year is the first two months, so I hope that I can keep my training going until the snow flies and I can cross-country ski.     I have a countdown app on my phone (the app is called ""BigDay""). It says that I have 154 days left until I hit the trail. I think about my upcoming trip all the time. ""The mountains are calling.....""",,How I am training...,"Oct 10, Sat",0
Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516279,"In late June, Goldberry and I hiked the Massachusetts AT (five days) as a practice hike. It was generally hot and buggy but a great learning experience. As usual, we made tons of mistakes and learned from them. We also met thru-hikers Hip and Squabbler, Copperhead, Dagmar, BedgieBear, and Moab Momma. Getting a chance to hike with thru hikers and ask them questions made us more confident and excited about our hike. We hiked from October Mountain shelter to Dalton, with the goal of reaching the Crystal Mountain campsite. But we spent too much time swimming in a cold stream and suddenly it got hot and there was mud and we found ourselves struggling as we crossed the railroad tracks and entered Dalton. The lure of pizza was too great and the long road-walk was hurting our feet, so we spent the night in the Shamrock Inn. The next day, we were supposed to hike Greylock, but we were suddenly four miles behind schedule and it would be a long day....so we hitchhiked to Cheshire and had a great hike. Our first experience with ""yellow blazing"". Actually, it was kind of fun to run into the same thru hikers later in the evening atop Greylock.     Fast forward to October...we felt bad skipping the Dalton to Cheshire portion, so we headed out on a cool Saturday morning to do the nine miles we skipped. What a difference! I am looking forward to our thru-hike, but hiking in the fall is really different. No ticks. No mosquitos. Cool breeze and brilliant foliage. For the most part, we had the trail to ourselves! We met a SOBO woman with a german shepherd sporting a doggie go-pro, a hunter, and a blaze-painting volunteer. The Cheshire Cobble is a pretty 1500-foot pile of rocks covered with birch and beech trees. The Crystal Mountain tentsite was pretty and empty. There was one stretch coming down into Cheshire where someone had painted ""Notch road (arrow)"" about thirty times in red paint so that nobody would ever have trouble finding the Notch road. Somehow, though we missed this famous road.     So. Lessons learned--hike with poles through the deep fallen leaves to help your balance when you step on hidden rocks. You don't need as much water in the fall (we carried only one liter each for nine miles). Don't hitchhike around sections of trail (it took us four hours of combined driving to get back and forth from home this time). Also, never miss an opportunity to go hiking--it was a perfect way to spend Saturday morning.",,Dalton to Cheshire,"Oct 24, Sat",9
Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516543,"So, I am training to hike the AT, so it seemed logical that I should finally try some backpacking on the AT. Goldberry and I decided to hike the Pemi Loop (clockwise), a 32-mile loop that runs over many 4000 footers in the White Mountains of Vermont. Anyway, it was beautiful and Goldberry and I really enjoyed the four days we spent hiking the loop. It was the first long hike of the summer where I didn't want to stop at the end--I wanted to keep hiking on towards Maine.     Then, we went home and I began my other life as a math teacher and I didn't have time to backpack. Until I saw an internet blog entry called ""surviving the Pemi Loop death march."" Evidently, there are some crazy people who hike the whole Pemi Loop in one day. I went to school and asked my buddy Ed whether after I hike the AT next year maybe we can try the one-day Pemi Loop. Ed, who is crazy, said that was the boring way and that if I really wanted an adventure, I should do it without additional training, that very weekend. I told him that he was crazy and I certainly wouldn't do it.     But I couldn't get it out of my head. Also, I liked his idea--that an adventure that was properly thought out and for which you are thoroughly prepared isn't really an adventure. To really get the full experience, the real ""thrill"", you have to be unsure of whether you will complete the adventure unscathed. There has to be uncertainty and .... fear.     So Ed and I tackled the one-day Pemi Loop at 4 AM and hiked until 9 PM, a 17-hour marathon where we averaged only a bit over 2 miles per hour. But we did it, and in reaching my goal, I had an unforgettable adventure and proceeded one step closer to being ready to tackle the AT!",,Pemi Loop Madness,"Oct 28, Wed",0
Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516913,"A year or so ago, my wife and I began to discuss trail names.     This summer, we met many characters on the trail--Voltron, Dagmar, BedgieBear, Scout, Birthdaybear, MaleMouse, MightyMouse, Hip, Squabbler, Copperhead, BearFish, Salmon, Slider, Sparrow, Moab Momma, and others. We met a thru-hiker with a full sword and one with a bow and arrows. We met elderly hikers, teenage hikers, stoned hikers, and German hikers. Almost everyone had a trail name, though.     First--we had decide whether to wait and let the trail ""name us"" or to ""choose names"" ourselves. Because we wanted our names to both stand alone and let us be part of a ""couple,"" we decided to choose our trail names ourselves. We liked the Urbanski's names ""Stopwatch & Optimist"" because they represented their personalities. We also enjoyed ""Snail and Patience,"" mentioned by David Miller in AWOL. My favorite ""self-chosen"" name was ""Odyssa,"" Jennifer Pharr-Davis's trail name, from the Odyssey. For a while, we chose ""Grin and Bearit,"" (she and I) but I was never really comfortable with those names. We combed through movies and literature looking for appropriate couples. Most of them were too nerdy or presumptuous. I could probably manage to be a king or a wizard for a weekend, but I don't think I could keep it up for five months (or more!).     Because both of us like Lord of the Rings, we finally settled on two characters from that book named Bombadil and Goldberry. They love each other dearly and are one with nature, living in harmony with the songs that make up Tolkien's universe. The final test is whether we can actually call ourselves by these names and introduce ourselves with these names--whether we can get comfortable in them and answer to them. Truly, I am a bit uncomfortable with how odd ""Bombadil"" sounds, but I'm sure it will feel better with more time and more adventures.",,A note about trail names....,"Nov 05, Thu",0
Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517498,"Last December, I hiked my 30th Monadnock of the year (a local 3150-foot mountain) and decided that I should train for my AT thru-hike by hiking ""fifty Monadnocks while I was fifty years old"". However, I immediately fell behind on this goal because I was hiking long miles on other trails (like the AT). When September arrived, I had hiked fewer than ten Monadnocks, and I had all but given up on that goal. The big picture was clear--practice long-distance backpacking by DOING long-distance backpacking.     However, teaching math and all the work that goes with my life as a prep-school teacher stopped me from doing overnight backpacking, and during the fall I discovered that I could drive to Monadnock after school and hike up and down before it became too dark. At first, I fit in three or so per week, but after I while I was climbing five or more times per week. I tried to bring friends and family with me. I also used this opportunity to get to know the other teachers better and even to do some prep!     I first hiked Grand Monadnock when I was three or four. I grew up only about thirty miles away, in Carlisle, MA. We hiked most of the local mountains, from Watatic and Wachusett, to Monadnock, to Tecumseh, to Lafayette and Washington. When I moved to Dartmouth, Mount Moosilauke became my ""local"" mountain. After college, I taught at Kearsarge Regional High School (North Sutton, NH), where Mount Kearsarge was my local mountain. I often hiked it after school, hiking through the woods from the high school and getting back to my car well after dark. Then, I moved to Claremont and taught at Steven High School, where we had Mount Ascutney. I never really got used to Ascutney, so when I moved to the Winchendon School in Winchendon, MA, I became reacquainted with my old friend Grand Monadnock.     Fast forward to twenty five years climbing Monadnock, celebrated today by my fiftieth Monadnock summit of the year. My favorite Monadnock hike this year was probably the final day of the four-day SOBO Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway, which finishes atop Monadnock. Another good day was hiking with the Ron Burton Training Village and my friends Alex and Adam. Seventeen of my Monadnocks this year were with my daughters, who are also training for thru-hikes. I'm glad I could combine family time with training!    So I have achieved one goal--fifty Monadnocks--and set my next goal squarely in front of me--THRU HIKE THE AT THIS SPRING!",,My training trail--Monadnock,"Nov 17, Tue",0
Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517736,"Goldberry and I hiked from North Adams, MA, to Stratton Mountain, VT over four days of Thanksgiving week. We left a car at the Greylock Park Community Center, which is right next to the trail. It's free, but you have to register inside the bar and it would be nice if you left a few bucks for the ""children's activities"" charity when you pick up your car. Also, don't park in the parking lot--they want you to park on the lawn by the road up next to the tree trunk.    A ten-minute walk from Rte 2 leads to the colorful bridge over the Hoosic River (see my photos). Many thanks to the elementary school that put the colorful hand prints on the bridge! The trail goes right through someone's property on the way into the woods. There is a sign that says that there are four bicycles that can be borrowed to resupply or explore North Adams. Guthook says that in warmer weather, there is a hose for water refill next to the trail, but it was 25 degrees and we had plenty of water anyway. We found no shortage of water throughout the four-day hike.    Anyway, this entry is mainly about STAYING WARM! We experimented with staying in shelters when it was cold--25 degrees the first night and 18 degrees the third night (the second night, we cheated and stayed at the Hampton Estates in Bennington). We arrived at Goddard Shelter at 3 PM, but since the sun would soon go down, we didn't go on. We made a nice fire (no shortage of firewood), made dinner, and went to sleep at six-ish.     I woke up in the middle of the night, cold and not sure whether to get up to pee or stay in the sleeping bag. I tried to keep sleeping, but finally I decided to get up and check the time. Maybe we could get an early start on the next day's hike! No dice.....it turned out to be 8 PM; the sun would rise in ""only"" TEN HOURS. It was going to be a long night.     We made it through, but we were chilly. At least we still had unfrozen water (we are comparing iodine tablets to aqua mira. Filters don't work well below freezing. Both of us got headaches coincident with drinking the iodine-tablet water, so we prefer the aqua mira). Next time, we will arrive at the shelter later in the day so that we won't have to sit around freezing for as long.    That day, we called a cab from the top of Harmon Hill, which was waiting for us at Rte 9. We ate at Chili's and stayed at the Hampton Estates in Bennington. The next morning, we taxied back to Rte 9 and were hiking by 7:30 AM.     It was a beautiful day of hiking. Sort of a woodsy ""shire"" from ""The Hobbit"". There were many forests of very short Beech trees and moss and streams. Glastonbury Mountain was easy to climb, but when we got to the shelter, we discovered that it was very windy and cold. I decided that we had to go to the next shelter, Kid Gore. We didn't want to stay at 3800 feet because it was colder up there. When we arrived at Kid Gore, the sun was going down.     Our JetBoil struggled to heat three pots of water in forty minutes. When the temps fall below freezing, the gas has less pressure and the stove burns much less efficiently. But we got dinner cooked and eaten and then dove into our sleeping bags. Goldberry heated water and put the Nalgene in the foot of her bag for warmth and to stop it from freezing (the water). We were very cold that night. We tried using a mylar blanket and a cuban fiber tent for blankets, and the vapor barrier worked quickly. Unfortunately, we also became wet from the condensation from the vapor barrier and began to shiver. Quickly, we got rid of the vapor barrier, but I was really cold. I was wearing all of my clothing and still I was cold! Luckily, I decided to remove much of my layers, leaving myself with just a shirt, and the resulting extra space actually made me warmer! Also, I learned how to tuck my head way down in the sleeping bag and seal the top from the cold air. Goldberry and I spent much of the night listening to ""Under the Eagle"" by Simon Scarrow on my I-phone. Anyway, I was on the verge of shivering and cold all night, but we made it. In the morning, it took a while to get our hands and feet warm, but we hiked aggressively until we warmed up.     I need to get a warmer sleeping bag for my March Thru-hike. There's no way I want to go through another night like that one! The next fourteen miles were beautiful, with streams and moss and spruce trees. We met our daughter (""Loon"") on top of Stratton Mountain, and we all walked down the ski run (hard on the knees!) back to the the car. On the way home, we stopped at ""The Freightyard,"" a nice restaurant in North Adams, for burgers.",,Staying Warm in Vermont over Thanksgiving,"Nov 27, Fri",0
Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518739,"Like most others who are starting in March, I just want to get going! I'm worried that the fitness I carefully developed over the summer and fall is disappearing. My daughters and I have hiked Monadnock a few times over Christmas break. I am grateful for this beautiful little mountain next door to my home.    We continue to accumulate gear. Because my wife and two of my daughters are thru-hiking in March, our Christmas was full of headlamps, wool socks, Yaktrax and other trail accessories. Chris and I upgraded our sleeping bags to feathered friends -15 bags after our chilly Thanksgiving Vermont AT experience.   I think that we will be warm enough, but we should be dehydrating more food--we're quite far behind on that task. I have high blood pressure, so I don't think that I should be eating high sodium ""mountain house"" or lipton noodle dishes.     By the way, I've read about twenty AT books, and I heartily recommend three. For humor, I recommend Bill Walker's book ""Skywalker: Close Encounters on the Appalachian Trail"" (if you like it, read his ""Highs and Lows on the Pacific Crest Trail""). For both advice and philosophical help, I suggest David Miller's ""AWOL on the Appalachian Trail"" (yes-he also wrote the AT Guide). For inspiration, I suggest ""Becoming Odyssa"" by Jennifer Phar-Davis (yes-the fast one). The first two books are available on Audible.com, so you can listen to them while hiking! Of course, ""Appalachian Trials"" (Zach Davis) is very good, but I enjoy actually reading ""journal"" style books, where the reader gets to follow along with someone's adventures.     I also got two DVD movies, ""Trek"" and ""Two Thousand Miles to Maine."" Both of them are interesting, but I enjoyed ""Trek"" more because it was about one group the whole way--but ""Two Thousand Miles to Maine"" probably gives a more thorough, clearer, introduction to trail life. I am glad I got them to see various hostels and watch them resupplying and dealing with the rain and heat and such.     SEVENTY FIVE DAYS TO GO!",,Merry Christmas,"Dec 25, Fri",0
Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522396,"It has been a hectic month, preparing for the trip and teaching AP Calculus. First of all, I am thankful to The Winchendon School for granting me a sabbatical to leave early and miss April, May, and graduation. Also, thanks to Jon, Kelly, Pete, Ricky, Hannah, and Shannon for taking over my classes and other duties while I am away walking.    I told my friend Fiona the other day that I hope that I am a different person when I return in the fall. To a certain extent, we all choose the easy road sometimes, compromising our selves by conforming to the societal norms we see all around us. I wish to become more ""me"" somehow.    My wife and I have packed up about 200 gallon zip-lock bags, each containing one day's food for one person. This is typically oatmeal, granola bar, nuts, cookies, dried fruit, tea, hot chocolate, and a dinner. I've packed about fifteen boxes with about ten bags inside each, plus toilet tissue & vitamins. We drove ten boxes to my in-laws' house in New Hampshire. They have kindly volunteered to ship the boxes to the correct places on the correct dates. I will list these addresses and dates on this site if anyone else wants to send us cookies or beef jerky or whatever.     We shipped our backpacks to Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega so that we wouldn't have to worry about the airplane losing them or breaking them. It cost $50 to send each large box containing food and full backpacks to Georgia.     My training has suffered while I gave exams and finished my commitments at school. My last grade slips of the year will be due this weekend (three days before I leave for Georgia). I get in a few hikes now and then, some with a heavy pack, but nothing like what I have been doing over the past year.    I enjoy reading the trail journals of those who left earlier and those who are leaving around the same time as we are. I hope to meet Subman and Magyar and NorthStar, but it's probable that many of those who began ahead of me will stay ahead for the duration, leaving me to read their shelter register entries.     As I have mentioned, two of my daughters are also in their final preparations for their AT thru-hike (Loon and Verge). All four of us are becoming frantic with preparations and a bit nervous about weather and rain and snakes and whatever worries us the most. We are trying to think positively and get excited, but at times these emotions convert themselves into worry.    My biggest worries: (1) injury (foot). (2) blood pressure (high). (3) cold during day. (4) pack too heavy (still hovering around 40 lbs fully loaded with food and water). (5) wife not happy (I don't have much control over this, but if she's happy, I'm generally happy). (6) Lyme disease.    We have met with several thru-hikers, especially Guiseppe (triple-boomerang) and Neon, who gave us encouragement.   We have read the books, watched the movies, done practice hikes. Now we get to wait seven days. ""Every action has consequences--when you choose the action, you choose the consequences""",,Last day of school!,"Mar 03, Thu",0
Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523230,"Last night I woke up at one AM, thinking it was time to go. I fell asleep and awoke about five more times. I was nervous and excited. Can I do this? Am I one of the 80% or the 20%? The Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega is a clean and beautiful lodge with everything I need. Goldberry and I made spaghetti for dinner and sat around a fire chatting with other would-be thru hikers. I met Pop Tart from Albuquerque and BookNboots from Australia and JuanDurer (who is recording ""sounds of the trail"" for iTunes.    In the morning, Duffy and Mouse made everyone pancakes and eggs, then drove us to Springer, about an hour. We were hiking at 9:30 and at the top of Springer at 10:00. After signing the trail register and snapping a pic, we headed towards MAINE.    Goldberry did great, hiking 2-3 miles per hour for the whole morning. About 1PM, we passed Hawk Mountain shelter. We saw about ten hikers already sitting in the shelter, unwilling to hike farther and possibly lose their spot. By that time, the trail was mostly clear of hikers; except when we passed Gooch Mountain shelter, we only saw four or five people all afternoon. With all the hype about overcrowding, it seems like there would be no problem if more people would just stay in tent sites away from the shelters.     We met a few more hikers, including Tejano and DustyPapa. Everyone has been very nice to us. Both Goldberry and I are exhausted after our 18 mile day. The real test will be if we can get up and do it again tomorrow. And, the day after, we have a 21 miler planned. Tomorrow is Blood Mountain, Georgia's highest point, or at least the highest one on the AT.    The coolest thing about today's hike was the ""holly forest"" on Gooch Mountain. It's still brown and leafless everywhere (think 75 degree, humid, winter) but on one hillside there were many holly trees, a whole forest of them, and they keep their leaves in the winter, so it was suddenly green everywhere. Also, we saw several very pretty groves of Rhododendron trees/bushes.     Thanks to the Georgia ATC, the trail is in great shape. I'm hoping for another day without rain tomorrow and a great hike over Blood Mountain!","Last day of school!

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523317,"Everyone told us that Blood Mountain would be difficult. Whoah! The highest point on the Georgia AT! As it often turns out, none of them had actually climbed Blood Mountain, which turned out to be a relatively easy climb. In fact, it was a similar climb to Glastonbury Mountain (Vt), much easier than Garfield or Monadnock. There is a big stone shelter at the top and many lovely views. One caveat--the downhill on the other side was pretty rugged.     At the north bottom of Blood Mountain is a hostel and outfitter Mountain Crossings. It has a great patio with picnic tables. D squared gave us his extra pizza and we bought bananas and energy drink. We also ran into Dustyspapa again, who told us more about his life in Utah.     Tomorrow is 100% chance of rain and we've planned a 21 mile day to Unicoi Gap. We are going to start early and go hard! The highlights from today were:    1. We did ok--my back got chafed a bit and Goldberry's ankle is tweaks, but our knees are ok.    2. We met two ents coming down Blood Mountain.    3. The views were the best yet, all blue mountains stretching away in wavy layers to the horizons    4. The rain that was forecasted never arrived.    5.

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523485,"We got going in the pouring rain at Neels Gap at 7:30 AM. Nobody else was hiking--everyone was huddled in their tents and hammocks, waiting for the rain to quit. ""Dusty's Papa"" started behind us and caught us about three miles out of Neels. A southbound young twentys-ish boyscout-looking hiker went past us in the pouring rain with no rain gear, just a tshirt. He explained that he ""thrued last year and prefers to get wet during the day and change into his rain gear in the evening in camp to stay dry and warm."" We hiked up Levelland Mountain and Cowrock Mountain, with the rain gradually lessening.    I am wearing the Wildcat GTX shoes that are ""gore-tex"" waterproof. The water ran down my legs and filled my shoes completely after an hour, squishing out the ankles with each step. My rain jacket is a bit short in the waist also, so my shorts were soaked though quickly. I thought that the wet would chafe badly, but I think that rain-wet is much better than sweat-wet, and chafes less, because I felt ok all day. My feet weren't as happy. My wet socks bunched down in my toes and gradually created hot spots. Also, it was ""freight-train"" sounding wind and my bare legs cramped up a bit on the uphills. I probably should have worn my rain pants just to protect my muscles from the cold wind and rain.        After we passed five southbound section hikers at Tesnatee Gap, we hiked up the steep incline to Wildcat Mountain--the steepest climb of the day. We took a break at ""Hogpen Gap"" (don't you love these names?) and then pushed on to ""low gap,"" where we met a bunch of nice people (including a couple from Portland, Maine) who were mostly deciding to stay in that shelter for the night.     No such luck for us. We changed socks and took care of our feet. We Aquamira'd two more liters of water in preparation for the final ten miles (including Blue Mountain). My pack was rubbing my lower back raw, so I applied body glide, which stung like acid when I put the pack back on.        It was a long haul up Blue Mountain, and I could see that we were in a race with the sunset. As Bill Walker points out in his funny and excellent trail book ""Skywalker's Adventures on the AT"", Blue Mountain has multiple false peaks. Don't be fooled until the ""top"" with the shelter. From there, the actual peak is TWO little ups and downs away. The walk down to Unicoi Gap was about the same difficulty as the walk down the north side of Blood Mountain. Rocks and zigzags. Or maybe I just thought it was the same difficulty because it was getting late and we'd covered more than 20 miles.     Shout out to Loon and Verge--your time is coming soon! I signed my first shelter log for you at Low Gap. Also, it was fun to meet BookNBoots again. We also met a Scottish woman and a couple from Hawaii.

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523638,"I awoke early to get ready for our four-mountain, sixteen-mile day. I found a cool scorpion (see photos) but then I killed it (sorry, Anna, but, in my defense, it was a scorpion). After oatmeal, we were hiking out of Unicoi Gap by eight AM, in the cool morning. 
At first it was a thousand feet up in a mile, then down 300, then up another thousand in the next mile up to Trey Mountain. Somehow it was actually five miles, I'm not sure how. Anyway, we met an old guy with a hurt back at Trey Gap--he had driven his pickup truck up full of firewood, a table, and a chair. He was meeting his friends and doing a mega trail magic hiker feed. We were too early to enjoy the feed, so while Goldberry rested, I helped stack firewood. So many super people set up tables and cook food and do all kinds of trail magic. 
After the summit of Trey Mountain, we stopped at the Trey Mountain Shelter and signed the register. We met a woman named ""Rescue"" because she was a wilderness certified EMT. Her golden retriever was named ""Bear"" and once I threw his tennis ball for him, he would not leave me alone--he kept retrieving and retrieving. 
We met another group of laughing singing twenty-somethings, two girls and two boys. The girls are filming a movie while they are on the trail, so I will call them the ""movie girls."" After a couple more mountains, we ran low on water, so Goldberry went onwards while I walked about a mile and a half to get three more liters. It took me more than an hour to catch up, after we passed Kelly's Knob, which was only as much vertical as Wachusett (but elevation about 4000 feet). Coming down from the last mountain of the day (forgot the name) I caught up with her and we suffered sore knees together.
We caught a shuttle from Dicks Creek Gap into Hiawasse, Georgia, and stayed at the budget inn. It is quite cheap--private bathroom & room with AC and shuttle both ways to the trail for $40. In the parking lot, we met Dustyspapa and the Swiss guy who finally got a trail name. His real name is Manuel, which sounded to someone like manual, so he is now ""clutch"". We also met Turtle and others, but coolest of all, Miss Janet (funny and nice trail angel) was there with her van, ""bounce box"" .

It was a sad day for at least three of our new friends, who left the trail at Hiawasse due to injury. However, we met some new ones--an Aussie girl named Mountaingoat, a much-tattooed string young man named Baja, a nice young ladybird (also with beautiful colorful tattoos), Morning Lori, Pinky, and Quasimodo, who I liked a lot. There are about fifteen people at Bly gap tonight, but it's not crowded. 
We didn't cover as many miles today as we wanted, due to a late start. Better luck tomorrow because we have four days' food and our resupply is at the NOC, sixty miles away.

Many hikers are headed to Franklin to resupply, but we are hoping to go straight through to the NOC. Goldberry is a bit frustrated by this--she wants town food and comfort.    The best thing that happened lately was the stars and the moon. It has been very light at night; the moon shows through our semi-transparent cuban-fiber tent, acting like a tent light. When we awaken in the morning, the moon has set and the stars are bright in the dark sky.    D squared and his group wake at 3:30 and hit the trail at 4:30. I hope to be that motivated someday.

Stopping there briefly, we met Princess and Crocket. Crocket is a legally blind hiker who started about a week before we did.     On our way up Albert Mountain, we ran into an elderly hiker with Athsma who was hiking with a hiker who had a heart attack and bypass surgery last year and had trouble in both knees. He was sending photos of himself in different places to the assisted living unit that he used to be in.       AWOL said that Albert Mountain is the first mountain on the trail where you ""can touch the ground in front of you while you are climbing."" Well, for the last twenty minutes, it was steep! Definitely the steepest climb thus far. The fire tower and view were worth it! McFly was there with his buds Cheddar, Kenya, and Chomp. They were playing ""Home (this must be the place)"" by the talking heads. It's nice to meet youngsters who have decent taste in music. Cheddar continues to hike in Crocs due to blisters. She is very nice--as are her trail angel parents. 
Near Rock Gap, my ankle began to hurt. I haven't had any problems with my ankle for years, so this worried me. I hoped that it would get better after a night's rest. Goldberry and I decided to stay at the shelter at Rock Gap, our first shelter stay. We shared the campsite with about fifteen hikers, but only one other, ""Carefree"" , stayed in the shelter. We had a nice chat about Lord of the Rings. 
As we cooked dinner, we met a tattoo-artist named ""Doc"" and ""helo"" (the guy who had the heart attack). We enjoyed chatting with them about food and life.
At night, a group of wild pigs (boars) ran through the edge of our campsite, waking up hikers and startling them. Also, we could hear a mouse gnawing on something much of the night.","Beech Gap

I decided that I had to go get some rest for my ankle or we would never get to the NOC. We hitched a ride from a retired math teacher named Becky.

Just sayin'. I will certainly be well rested and clean by the time tomorrow morning rolls around. The First Baptist Church of Franklin put on a hiker breakfast--a daunting AYCE prospect for thirty or so thru hikers. It was a beautiful affair, with shuttles to the hotels and hostels, pancakes, bacon, and coffee. They took pictures of everyone and gave them out and gave us paper and envelopes so that we could write letters to people we missed. They even mailed the letters for us.

My day started in the black predawn 25 degrees at Wayah Bald shelter, packing up after many hours of tossing and turning. Ghost Rider, a marine with plantar fasciitis left the shelter first. After I packed up completely, I woke Goldberry and packed her sleeping bag and pad, ripping her stuff sac in the process. We were on the road by 7:15. It was a day of ups and downs, trying not to aggravate my injured left ankle. We hit some nice trail magic (an orange and a chat with Tens '06) on the way up Wesser Bald. From the top, we could see a huge forest fire in the distance, throwing up yellow and grey smoke. We thought the fire was far away, but on the way down the 7- mile ridge-descent, the smoke thickened until we were walking above a valley of smoke in both sides of us and there was thick smoke blowing up over the ridge. I began to feel sick and jittery and weak. We were above the thickest smoke, but were clearly descending into pea soup. I did my best to get Goldberry moving faster. I was seriously worried about my lungs (Goldberry didn't seem to be affected). My ankle was hurting, so I decided to try my secret weapon: Nick had given me his spare ankle brace, but I was worried that it would cause other foot problems. But, with the six- mile 3000 foot descent and the smoke, I put on the brace, it really helped! We did the last few miles in two hours and arrived at the NOC tired but alive at 6 pm. Chompa, Clutch, Stretch, Slam, and some others were there already . We had a nice dinner (Sherpa rice, chips, Guinness, brownie sundae) and then stayed in the bunkhouse near the river.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524551,"We got a really late start today. Had a great breakfast, but my ankle still hurt. My goal for the day was to get to the ridge without hurting it more. I walked slowly and focused on each step, trying not to overcompensate by putting too much weight on my right foot. It was a short day, only five hours, but 3000 feet of uphill, some of it ""New Hampshire steep"". Around four, I began to get lightheaded and felt shortness of breath. I knew I was probably being hyperchondriac, but I wondered whether I was suffering from breathing in thick smoke all afternoon the previous day. I had a break and some water. Not long after my break, I encountered Goldberry, who suddenly tripped and fell forward, hitting her face against some rocks! After getting up and settling herself, she was mostly ok (people may ask questions tomorrow when they see her). The shelter was full and there were no tentsites nearby, so we are tenting up on the ridge in the wind. It probably won't get below freezing though. 
Because we had a signal, we called Verge and Loon (read her trail journal at www.trailjournals.com/loon/","NOC

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524716,"As usual, I struggled to stay in my sleeping bag past 4:30. Finally, I left the tent sometime near five and began making the oatmeal. Goldberry packed one oatmeal per person per day, some with peanut butter.or dried strawberries, or cinnamon and raisins. She awoke when the oatmeal was ready and we were off hiking by seven thirty. She started ahead because I had to stop and get out my short sleeved shirt, which was of course at the bottom of my pack. (We are sharing a shelter tonight with ""Tetris"", who got his trail name because when he packs his pack it is like playing tetris)    The view at the top of the first mountain, Cheoah Bald, was the best view yet, with grass, and sun rising, and miles of blue mountains stretching into Georgia. Many people had stayed up there in the wind because Sassafrass Gap was too crowded. I chatted with ""golly,"" a mid-20s San Franciscan who is a good hiker. The downhill was very painful on my ankle, undoing the night's healing. At a road crossing, I caught up with Goldberry and about fifteen others, spread out on the green (tick-less, for now) grass. We stretched and took care of feet. I put on Saint Nick's extra ankle brace and headed up Jacob's ladder, a series of short steep climbs. This time, I strayed ahead of Goldberry and reached the shelter about a half hour earlier than she.     Nobody was around, so I played Mariachi until she caught up. Mariachi music, even the sad ones, cheers me up and gives me energy. Goldberry wanted to continue hiking, but my ankle was defeated, so we stayed. Good thing--an hour later, a hard rain blew through and stayed for two hours. We were joined by Cheddar and the Boyz ( who tented, built a wading pool, and enjoyed a nice campfire in the rain) and by RC (a retired marine who got tired of golfing and mowing the lawn), tree hugger, bear claw, and a Kiwi.

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524823,"It poured off and on for most of the night. The rain probably helped us to sleep, but I felt sorry for everyone with a tent in a ""dry"" creek bed, because they all became rivers during the four hours of rain. I texted Verge and Loon, and apparently they were dry, once they got their tent set up. 
The pattern with my ankle is clear. Every morning, I feel better, but after several long miles of downhill, it starts to hurt and even swell up. Every night, I figure that the series will lead to a healthy ankle if the daily sum ""heal"" minus ""hurt"" comes up positive. But it hasn't been positive, especially with the big downhills into NOC and Fontana. So, Goldberry convinced me that it was time to take another ""zero"" day, after which it will be on the mend for good. Also, we will begin the Great Smoky Mountains when we leave Fontana, and that means 72 miles in five nights (six days). Sounds easy, if my ankle is healthy. The supply problem is worsened because in the Smokies, we are only allowed to camp at established shelter sites. On certain days, that means choices between eight miles per day and sixteen miles. Goldberry says no 20-milers until after the Smokies at least. 
But I am a bit ahead of myself. Last night, during the rain, we went to sleep early (5:30),but there was quite a bit of chatter and bustle for a couple more hours. At one point, when the rain let up for a minute, someone joked that they could see a rainbow. ""Lord Bearclaw"" an interesting hiker, then sang the whole ""rainbow connection"" song from the first muppet movie. He did a really good job, and it sounded nice with the rain in the background. I've only met one other musical type so far, JuanDurer, who regaled us at the hiker hostel with some really good tunes. I've also seen ""dulcigal's"" blog, which says that she wants to carry her dulcimer with her once she passes the smokies. I hope she does! Music on the trail is much appreciated. We have passed two groups who occasionally sing. Some people think that the wilderness should be serene and quiet, but there's plenty of space and time for us all. I like the enthusiasm of the singers. 
Anyway, if you can't tell from the length of this post, Goldberry and I have made it to the Fontana Lodge in the town of Fontana Dam. We picked up our resupply (they tried to give us Loon's also, but we declined. this is the second time). The Fontana Lodge is pretty much a real hotel, with a double room going for $70. The rooms are really decent--worth more like $150 by New England standards. 
This morning, I hiked for a while with ""old school"" who sports a Greatful Dead hat, and with ""tetris"" who was hiking about my pace. Goldberry didn't fall today, but last night in the shelter, she awoke, got up, and whacked her head terribly against the roof (which had sharp screws sticking through it), adding new abrasions to the ones she got from the fearsome head over heels the previous day.
I met ""RC,"" a young retired marine (a few years older than I am) who chose to go on the trail because life seemed to be an endless series of mowing lawns, playing golf, eating, and sleeping. All of his friends get together and discuss who is getting a knee replacement or moving into a retirement home, so he wanted to do something more exciting and different. However, the days of ""wakeup, hike 15 miles, go to sleep"" seemed to be getting him down. He is looking forward to Virginia, where it will be warmer and he can make his pack lighter. I enjoyed talking to him, and I hope he has more fun in the near future. It would be sad if he left the trail. 
Next big challenge: getting through the smokies before our food runs out. We plan to go to Standing Bear Hostel at the end of the smokies.","Brown Forks shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524924,"Today is my zero day to fix (once and for all) my ankle. To stretch it out just a bit, Goldberry and I walked from the dam to the marina this morning, only about two miles (of course, this means two miles we won't have to do the morning we head into the smokies, possibly in the rain). Now, my hike complete, I will rest, ice, and elevate.    Goldberry spent more time yesterday socializing, but I spent my time resting as much as possible. On our walk this morning, we saw the shelter ""Fontana Hilton"". This is just a shelter, but not just a shelter. It looks like two regular shelters facing each other with a common area in between--except that both sides are two-deckers for sleeping purposes. In addition, it has a solar charging station(?!), hot showers, and flush toilets. Also, the view from the shelter is gorgeous, and it is high enough above the lake to catch the breeze. In short, Verge and Loon should grab their boxes at the Lodge and then hustle over to the shelter to stay.     It has been two weeks since Goldberry and I started hiking. Thus far, I am happy with everything except my ankle, which has been holding us up. Goldberry chides me, scolds me, and complains that I am too focused on each days' miles, pushing too hard to stay on schedule, but I really don't want to come up short at the end. I know it sounds a little silly to be worrying about the end of the hike when I am really in the first 10% (165 miles out of 2185), but I work better with a cushion. All of my friends know that leave for the airport early and arrive there two hours before my flight. I wake up at 5 AM to teach class at 8 AM (no commute). So, I will be able to relax better when I have built up a cushion on my September 1st deadline. Once I'm sure that the calendar and my hiking ability line up, I will be much more relaxed about daily miles.     Naturally, Goldberry focuses every day on having a great time and feeling good. She doesn't really enjoy my focus on getting 15 miles out of the way every day, rain or shine. Lately, she has been happy about our pace because I am injured (she assures me that she is not happy about my injury, though). I hope that when I get healthier, we will be able to reconcile this quirky personality difference with a schedule that works for both of us.     Currently, Goldberry is in our room doing yoga. I have been banned because I ruin the yoga mood, so I'm chatting with the other hikers in the lobby. A large group of our friends moved on this morning, but we stayed due to my zero. I am looking forward to seeing ""el tejano"" again soon--we met him at Springer. He is definitely moving faster than we are. Also, I wonder what happened to ""el lobo"".    Tomorrow, we hike into the Smokies. Due to the distribution of shelters and the rule requiring us to stay at shelters in GSMNP, we have to go about 15 miles each day. We have five nights' worth of food to travel 72 miles. Tomorrow is all about climb, possibly in the rain.","Fontana Dam-- the marina

Also, it was cold and foggy and drizzly all day.     Goldberry and I got a late start, but a nice Easter breakfast. We were walking over the dam at 9:30, ready to enter the famous Great Smoky National Park!
We hiked until 6 pm, pretty much continuously uphill, passing Mollies Ridge shelter at 4:30, but pushing farther. We met Cinnamon, a quiet young hiker wearing a red jacket. Goldberry and I were very pleased when we reached the shelter--there was enough room for us, even though there were about ten tents erected in a little village nearby. This shelter has a plastic tarp covering the fourth side and a fireplace! Someone had started a fire (Bryson, I think) and Juandurer was playing his banjo. It was a relaxing, peaceful, evening, rocked by violent cloudbursts all night outside, as though the gods were trying to see if they could soak the tents outside.
I met Munster, a very helpful, polite, and capable German in his mid 20s. He wins today's award for most helpful. There's ALWAYS ways to help others on the trail--opportunities to be sensitive and to go anticipate people's needs. I thought that I would be the guy to excel in this--at least I want to be, but thus far I am frequently just surviving, with little energy left over. I will keep trying to become as helpful as Munster!","Fontana Dam--the dam itself

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525920,"Because yesterday we passed a couple of shelters, Goldberry decided that we should have a short day today. I was generally ok with this plan, but we have six days' worth of food to cover 72 miles--this means that an 8-mile day will convert into at least a 16-mile day some other time. Also, ""stealth-camping"" is illegal in the Smokey Mountains, so you can only stay in or near a shelter. The problem was that the next shelter options will be 5-miles, 7-miles, or 13-miles. Sounds like the 13-mile shelter, right? Except that tomorrow, we will be climbing over Clingman's Dome, the highest point on the AT (6600 feet). 
My ankle is starting to feel better. Every morning, it feels ok, but by afternoon it is hurting again, and after a long day, it even hurts the next morning. BUT this morning, it didn't hurt at all, and even after the day's hike, it still didn't hurt. We'll see after Clingman's. 
Tonight, the most helpful person around the campsite was Bugs, a late 20s-ish polite ex-military dude. He is called Bugs because he brought carrots and peanut butter and ate the carrots for the first week or so of his hike. He has a kid and a wife, and has already left the trail for a few days to be with them. He also has significant knee pain and sciatica pain also. Due to his kindness and politeness, I hope for the best for him. In the Smokies, all the AT shelters have chimneys and fireplaces! Because it has been so cold, an evening fire has been welcome. I get some wood, but I'm not so great at actually starting the fire, particularly with wet wood. So, Bugs volunteered for the job of firestarter and fire-feeder. 
Today, I saw a buck deer with a large rack of antlers, a doe, and a fawn. We see evidence of the wild boars daily, but have only seen them once. The evidence is that they dig up the ground and the grass near the trail, as though they were plowing up the land for farming. The boars were brought here many years ago for hunting, but this miscalculation resulted in tremendous damage to the environment. Now, they hunt and trap them and still only manage to keep the population roughly constant. 
Midway through the day's hike, it began to get greener. Except for the holly and the Rhododendrons, the hillsides have been brown throughout our hike. Now, grass and some ground cover are starting to turn green, and there is some moss on the trees. Unfortunately, the green comes with constant cold fog and mist. We have even been hiking in the rain a bit, although it wasn't too heavy.","Russel fields shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525923,"We knew that we had to get started early and work hard today because of yesterday's short day. We passed the last shelter before Clingman's Dome (about 8 miles) by noon. Clingman's Dome is a high point that we have been anticipating throughout the hike. Although the view is the best thus far, Ed will be glad to know that his beloved White Mountains have no competition from this mountain. Despite its altitude, Clingman's wouldn't rate as even the tenth-most difficult climb of the trail, behind Washington, Katahdin, Lafayette, Moosilauke, Kinsman, and many others. It is very gradual, with the real climb only being 1500 feet or so. Interestingly, most of the climb smelled like unsmoked marijuana due to a small green ground-cover growing in that area. Also, we finally hiked up far enough to reach the balsam firs/spruce. The mountain wind only sounds ""real"" to me when it is blowing though the evergreens. 
We ran into Bugs most of the way up Clingman's, and hiked with him. He told us that ""hiking slow (with us..) helped his knees."" We have heard this previously from ""Booksmart"" who used us to pace himself so that he won't go to fast and hurt himself. At the top, the three of us (Goldberry, Bugs, and I) made a poor decision. We heard that there were snacks being sold down the road at the visitor center, so we hiked the 0.6 miles down a steep asphalt road. We also heard that there was a nice bathroom there (read it in Bill Walker's book). It was a long hot steep walk that hurt our feet because we are not used to hiking on the road. When we got to the parking lot, there was a one-hour wait for the bathroom! Unacceptable. We went to the store, and the only food they had was $2.50 chocolate bars. No chips. No soda. So, we bought four chocolate bars and headed back up the mountain, surrounded by hundreds of car-hikers of all ages and sizes. Back at the top, we went up to the observatory, temporarily becoming the highest (elevation!) hikers on the AT. Goldberry was tired, but I suggested to her that it would be all downhill to the shelter. After following the Clingman's Dome road for a while, gradually downhill, ""Guthook"" said that it was only about 2 miles to the shelter, so I let myself get ahead of Goldberry, figuring that it was an easy hike. WRONG! I had overlooked ""Mount Collins,"" so we went back up from 5200 feet up to 6300 feet again before we descended to the shelter. The shelter was muddy and far away from the trail, but we both got situated and Bugs made another fire. My ankle was hurting again, mostly because of that terrible walk down for the chocolate. 
Many people hike in groups, tending to spend the nights near a few people that they get along with. This night, we met ""Spike"" (a German with a big beard), two socks (young man from Colorado), and Trooper (strong-looking young woman). Turns out that Spike planned this trip for several years and he read all the same books that I did, so we spent much time reminiscing about what happened to AWOL or Skywalker at different locations. Another interesting person that we met at this shelter was ""Haznohorse"" an 83-year old hiker who was averaging over 21 miles per day! He had previously done the PCT and most fo the CDT (airlifted out with 800 miles to go with an injured knee). His start date was March 18, so he was moving faster than any of us. I spoke with him and he seemed very friendly and down to earth. I also saw him leaving the campsite at 5:30 just as I was getting up. Early to rise gets you to Maine, I guess.","Derrick's Knob shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525925,"So, today was pretty long, with a bit of rain and some cold. Once more, I got a bit ahead of Goldberry, hiking with Doc, a nice tattoo-artist from Alabama. Anyway, I eventually decided to stop and wait for Goldberry, but once she caught up, she was grumpy and decided that she didn't really want me hiking with her because she thought that I was encouraging her to go faster, and she didn't want such encouragement. So, I hiked ahead again, going fast. I felt really good, hiking about 3.5 miles in an hour uphill. I hiked for a bit with Canuck, a funny, friendly, Canadian hiker, who hikes really fast and then takes smoking breaks or view breaks every 40 minutes. So, I had fun hiking fast until midday, when I stopped at a shelter and Goldberry and I had a quick tea and clif bar snack. 
My quad started to hurt an hour or so later; I figured that I had strained it a bit when I was hiking fast. Two hours later, with about four miles to go, while I was walking on a flat (but cold and windy) stretch, my left knee kind of went ""pop"". Suddenly, I felt as though I lost all my uphill strength in that leg. My knee just didn't seem to work right. I stopped, put on warmups, stretched very lightly, and began to walk slowly. 
That's when something very strange happened. A bit more than a week ago, headed down a ridge towards the NOC, I was caught in the smoke from a ""controlled burn"" forest fire. At that time, the smoke was really making it difficult for me to breathe, but I began to panic, which made it worse. Later, I felt better, but the panicky feeling took more than a day to leave me. Today, however, when my knee ""popped"" and my leg became weak, I got all jittery and nauseated. My pulse felt weak and all I could think was that my hike was over, I was a failed thru hiker, and I would have to go home now. It wasn't rational, but I wasn't able to relax and think clearly. I know that my family loves me and I was certainly not in real danger this time, but I was panicking!
I tried playing music to calm down. I drank some water and hiked slowly to the music by ""The Tallest Man on Earth"" (thanks, Wolski). I was still shivery, weak, and sick to my stomach. So, because I had service for once, I called my brother Ian and chatted with him, which helped a bit. I made it over the two miles of uphill and began the two-mile descent to the shelter. It had begun to rain, and the wind was whipping the rain at me. When I finally got there, Goldberry had found me the absolute last spot in the shelter, which meant that I didn't have to set up my tent in the rain. I was tired, wet, and cold. Eventually, I cheered up, partly due to Bugs and Spike, who were friendly and chatted with me. Food helped also. That was a long day, and I was really worried about what would come the next day. 
I almost didn't get to find out! At about 2 AM, when the wind and rain really picked up, our whole campsite was awakened by a tremendous ""BANG!"". The only lightning strike of the night happened very close to the shelter, shocking everyone with its violence. There was a murmur and chatter from all of the 40 or so people camping and tenting around the shelter, then people went back to sleep.","Mount Collins Shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526018,"Today was a long-ish day, pushing hard mostly downhill to get close to the Standing Bear Hostel. It was marked mostly by Bugs's announcement that he would be leaving the trail at the next road crossing. We have lost some of our trail friends already, and we have only known Bugs for a few days, but this is a keen loss to our group. He was a repeat winner of my ""most helpful"" award, and we were all rooting for him. It was hard to feel sorry for him, though, because he had really accomplished what he came here to do--he didn't finish the AT, of course, but he did come to terms with some personal demons and eventually decided to go back and spend the time with his wife and child, rather than hiking. He will be back to do the trail when his children are old enough to hike it!
Even as Bugs was leaving, he was all class. He gave us his unused fuel and some spices. He tried to give away or sell cheaply everything he wasn't going to be using again. We will miss Bugs!
My knee felt a bit better today. I am hoping that it was just some sudden I-T band tightness, and that it will gradually get better over time. Lesson to be learned--don't push myself too hard. Although hiking fast is fun, and I've done it for decades, the result of an injury here is the ruin of my trip! I have not really analyzed the ""panic attack"" that I had.

I drifted ahead of Goldberry during the day, and even though I waited several times, she didn't appear. So, I called her on her phone (this was one of the rare moments in the Smokies when we had service). She said that she had been on the phone, and she was a solid 30 minutes behind. So, I continued downhill past a bunch of waterfalls until I arrived at a road with a cooler of hiker magic (I had a bottled water and a doctor pepper, but there was beer there as well). The directions from here were a bit confusing, but it was an interesting game, ""find Standing Bear Hostel."" Each step of the way, I texted my successful directions back to Goldberry. Cross the road, across the bridge, over the river, under the interstate, past the flowers, up the big staircase, past the mailbox with MORE trailmagic (cliff bars) and through the woods for a mile until I reached another gravel road.
The last mile was beautiful, with flowering trees, green grass, and crickets making all sorts of chirping noises. When I finally got to the Standing Bear Farm, it was both exciting, interesting, and disappointing.
The lodging was standard hostel digs--large bunk rooms with double decker bunks. There were clean sheets and pillowcases, but the ""mattresses"" were not clean. The kitchen was excellent, but also dirty. The resupply room was excellent, with frozen pizza and other goodies. We were instructed to write the description and price of everything we took on an envelope and hand in the envelope at the end of the stay. 
The showers had only cold water and they had an overflowing portapotty. However, there was a composting privy in the back that was more hygienic. When Goldberry arrived, she was upset by the look of the place and by the cold shower (very upset about the shower), but I gave her pizza right away, which made her feel a bit better. She immediately took a nap, waking up later for more pizza.","crosby knob shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526376,"Sometimes the universe mysteriously gives me a big hug; today was one of those days. We began as usual--I woke up an hour or two before Goldberry and did chores like trash, privy, resupply, packing, getting breakfast. Finally, she got up and ate her breakfast. The cat that slept with her caught a bloody mouse during the night and left it where I could step on it with my hiking socks. Thanks, kitty!
After paying Lumpy (the manager at Standing Bear Hostel) his $40, Goldberry and I hiked up a four-mile uphill to the top of Snowbird, where we saw a huge white high-tech witches hat (see photos) which, I've been told, is a facility that helps wayward airplanes navigate. From Snowbird, we hiked up a rolling few miles up and down past a couple of shelters, up through a couple climate zones, back up into cold, wind, pines, and spruces. 
At around the nine mile mark, we descended into a gap and suddenly came upon a tarp, a fire, and a couple of cars. The man tending the grill introduced himself as Mr. Orr, the father in last year's ""hiker family"". He and his wife brought FIVE kids the whole length of the AT last year! So, on this particular Saturday, they decided to camp out and cook food for hungry cold thru hikers. Goldberry and I had two hot dogs and a root beer. Also, the girls had baked cookies and brownies and put the into zips for takeout! I met the eldest girl, trail named ""Coach."" We also met most of the rest of the family as we hiked up towards the main goal of the day, Max Patch. This meeting was amazing because last summer, we tried to meet this family during our practice hikes and we followed their trail journal (you can read it on this site from last year). I thanked them and told them how wonderful it was to read about their journey.
About four miles later, as we neared Max Patch, we encountered a larger gathering with a grill, a fire, and an RV. It was ""Goose"" and ""Cap"" and several other class of 2015 thru hikers doing a hiker feed and promoting their cause, ""Pack it out"". Last year, they were the ""Pack it out boys,"" packing out all the trash from every campsite (obviously not just their own trash). They blogged their trip and their message (everyone should help to keep the trail clean, not just LNT, but also active cleanup). Through their hard work and blog, they got a job with the AMC right after they summited and they've been living the dream ever since. After this hiker feed, they head out to the PCT to ""Pack it out"" all the way up a Northbound PCT hike! Anyway, they remembered Goldberry and me from NH and Maine last year and said hi. We scored hamburgers and chips. This food meant that we wouldn't have to cook dinner that night at all, but could focus on staying warm and getting comfortable. 
We finally reached Max Patch, and it was worth the all-day hike. We broke out of the trees on a ridge and entered a long grassy field that became greener as we reached the summit. The summit was 360 degrees of mountains with all shades of blue fading into every direction. The green grass covered all the ridges like the picture from the Sound of Music. The difference was fifty mile-per-hour winds that nearly blew us over at every step--but after making sure all our stuff was tied down, we enjoyed the wind also. 
It felt as though all the effort from the 250 miles of hiking was transformed into joy. Actual tears filled my eyes as I walked through this beautiful ridge surrounded by wind and mountains. I could see that Goldberry was moved by this moment as well. We are looking for ""lessons from the trail"" and one of them is ""be open to moments of grace,"" those moments when your spirit soars and you feel filled with powerful fierce joy. This was one of those moments for me, and it will continue to feed me for years to come.
After Max Patch, we hobbled along to the Roaring Forks shelter, nestled in a grove of Rhododendrons. We were the only ones who chose to stay in the shelter because the wind was whipping into the front of the shelter and it was supposed to get into the twenties that night. We met up with Canuck, Moon-boots, Savage, Bigfoot, Owl, and a couple of section hikers. As it turns out, the wind picked up so much during the night that it knocked down some trees and branches and scared three of the tents/hammocks into the shelter at 2 AM. But Goldberry and I were warm enough in our super sleeping bags. 
On a scale of 1-10, today was a 9.8 (we didn't see a bear and it was a bit cold). Living the dream!","standing bear farm

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526377,"Today we awoke in a cold shelter and determined to get going fairly quickly. Only shooting star (Mennonite girl with green homemade dress) got going before us, although Medicine Man passed us pretty quickly. It was a cool morning with ice in our water bottles. Fortunately, we are using AquaMira instead of our filters. One person (named Owl) misplaced his filter last night and it froze (should have been in his sleeping bag). Once frozen, the filters will not function, although water will pass through them, it will not be treated!
We passed Groundhog Creek Shelter (with a beautiful grey dog) and climbed two small mountains, including Walnut Mountain, where we stopped and ate peanuts with Shooting Star. We met HuMAn, whose trail name is supposed to be short for ""a human practicing oneness."" Finally, we began the ""nine-mile downhill"" to Hot Springs. It took us until after five PM, but we got all the way down. Goldberry's foot hurt her enough to elicit a few tears and a break, but she reached the Laughing Heart Hostel at the edge of Hot Springs. She was so beat that she decided to stay at the Lodge, a bed and breakfast next to the hostel, where there was a nice bathtub! She really missed having a hot shower at Standing Bear, so I certainly didn't begrudge her this luxury. Besides, even I enjoyed the bathtub!
We walked into town and ate dinner at ""the Iron Horse,"" a fancy version of the GAH, so I had my favorite GAH meal, Caesar salad with blackened Salmon and Sweet potato fries. The food was great. We have decided to ""zero"" tomorrow, to heal everything from our 34 miles in two days.","Roaring Forks Shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526378,"We ate a short breakfast and then began our chores. I had to sew on some buttons and hunt down laundry machines. I also need at least an hour taking care of my feet. I am one of the only people I know who has NO blisters so far, thanks to practice, luck, and putting my feet first. 
About feet--
(1) Change your socks midday if they are damp. Even if you don't change your socks, take them off for at least five minutes and turn them inside out. Allow your feet to ""harden up"" with five minutes in the open air or sunshine. This will greatly reduce blisters. Also, when you stop, take out your insoles and let the shoes dry out a bit.
(2) Don't wear too much sock! If your feet sweat all day, you will get blisters! It's ironic that people wear more socks or heavier socks to prevent blisters, but the sweat actually causes them. The exceptions are liner socks that can wick the sweat away from the skin or if your boots don't fit, then you can help your situation by thick socks, but wouldn't it be better to have boots that fit?
(3) Use an emory board to get rid of calluses. You'd think that calluses are good because they are ""tough skin"" but actually, they rub against the skin under them or on the other toes and cause blisters! Smooth skin is good for hiking. Also, I carry a ""travel size bottle of Eucerin skin lotion"" and smooth it onto my feet in the evening to soften them. 
(4) A product called ""Trail Toes"". I bought it on line. It is some combination of bees wax and slippery stuff. During the day, if I get any red or hot spots, I rub some Trail Toes on that area to make the toes slippery. It has been working wonders! Even on my one-day ""Pemi Loop"" with Ed, I didn't get a blister!
Ok, so these are my tricks, and I'm sure that I've jinxed myself, and I'll have horrible blisters from now on, but I shared what I know. Now, I'm going to go do some more chores, like buying Tums (sometimes I end up going to bed right after I eat because it's cold, or sleeping on a slant with my head below my feet, causing heartburn). Also, I have to clean my inflatable sleeping pad (it's brown with dust and dirt instead of yellow. I don't want my blue sleeping bag to get that color too!).
A note: Some days, I have very poor cell service, so I can only enter one line or a picture. That's not my whole entry! I'm working on filling in the rest of my adventures next time I have enough service. Later today, I will fill in the entries from the Smokies that are so woefully brief.","Hot Springs

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526629,"We got started quite late, after breakfast and a stop at the Hot Springs post office. After crossing the French Broad river, the trail passed through another ""campus"" of the NOC and then followed the river for a mile. The trail went steeply upwards to ""lover's leap"", an 800 foot granite cliff looking out towards Hot Springs. As we left the town behind, I remembered the two days we spent there walking through the town and staying at the Lodge/ Laughing Heart Hostel. 
The Laughing Heart Hostel is a peaceful, comfortable, hostel whose staff is helpful and friendly. For those who don't want to pay $20 for the bunk room, there is tent-space on the lawn ($15) or ""The Lodge"" , a full bed and breakfast with bathtubs and gardens and fresh fruit for breakfast. The town also has two other hotels and several restaurants. A small building near the river is a ministry for hikers that also provides them with a porch and Internet and support. The outfitter (bluff mountain) has everything hikers want at reasonable prices, AND some luxuries like dried mango and rice ramen. They even have ""trout jerky""! Hot Springs is a very small town, but nice for hikers. 
After a full day of hiking up 3500 feet, we reached a cold and windy shelter. The only person already there was Bumpy, a 73-year old man who had both knees replaced. He had hiked 275 miles over many mountains with a full pack. We hiked with him for several more days, enjoying his company and amazed by his energy and resilience. 
It was a cold night; once more Goldberry and I were thankful for our super warm sleeping bags. We planned another 15 mile day, possibly in the rain tomorrow.","Hot Springs

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526772,"What is the Appalachian Trail?
It's therapy--each year, soldiers hike the Appalachian trail to help them ""hike off the war"" and reach a more peaceful state in order to integrate back into society. Also, many who have recently lost a spouse or a child hike the trail to learn to live with their grief. Others, caught in midlife crises or the existential angst of youth hike to ""find themselves."" Alone with rocks, trees, rain, and the mountains. 
It's a great physical challenge, testing everyone's grit, courage, strength, determination. How can the same trail challenge fit, athletic, twenty-ers, middle-aged corpulent desk-workers, and elderly retirees? Because each individual accepts the greatest challenge that they are seeking. I met an 83-year-old who is averaging twenty two miles per day, a 16-year-old hiking by himself, and a fifty year-old overweight math teacher, each tackling their daily challenges. For some who are afraid of heights, the peaks and ridges are almost impossibly difficult; I've seen people crawling down sections of trail that I thought were practically level. Some have trouble sleeping in the woods or walking through a heavy cold rainstorm. Everyone on the trail faces their greatest physical challenge--even a world-class ultra marathoner like Scott Jurek.
It's a spiritual journey--I met a young hiker named ""huMan"", who claimed that he was a human practicing oneness. I met a Mennonite who listened to the bible as she walked. I met the ""three yoga ladies"" who do yoga each morning before they hike. There are churches and missionaries on the trail and in trail towns. Almost every major religion has examples of people seeking nature, or mountains, or wilderness, to uplift the spirit.
It's a huge logistics problem! How much food? How many miles today? Wear the rain gear or the long johns? How much to eat? How do I fix that sleeping pad/ stove/ tent? If I get wet and the temperature falls to 20, how will I stay warm? How do you prevent infection? How do I treat my water? Is my ankle sprained, or broken? How many people can fit in that shelter? Can the altitude bother you at 6000 feet? When is it safe to hichhike? Can you eat dried fruit if it has white spots on it? What causes blisters? Why am I suddenly so weak? Do I need a rest day? Or will I just get colder, weaker, and hungry? 
It's a chance to become a new person, or a better person, to test values and interact with people of all ages from many countries, to learn how to be a better friend or companion. I've done three hundred miles so far, with only one thousand, eight hundred, eighty-five left to go.","Spring Hill shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526790,"Today was very strange. I was the first person up in the pre-dawn, making oatmeal and packing up. It stopped raining at about four AM, but the wind picked up and the temperature fell to just above freezing. Bumpy, Goldberry, and I were off hiking at about 7:45, later than I wanted, but not bad.
As the morning flew by, the sun came out weakly a few times, but the wind was cold and blustery. We passed Flint Creek and hiked with Doc to Devil's Gap. We had gone ten miles, but had six left, including a 2000 foot uphill. Goldberry was tired and frustrated by the long days and cold weather. We saw a sign indicating that a new hostel nearby had opened, so on a whim, we walked there along the road. When we got there, the first person we saw was Bumpy--he had the same idea as us and walked by a different path. 
Hiker's paradise was a small building with a large living area that had a gravel floor. In addition, there was a bathroom and a resupply area with a fridge and freezer. The living area had nine bunks and a picnic table. The owner charges hikers $15 per night to sleep in the bunks. Resupplies and laundry cost extra. The three of us ate pizza (frozen) while it began to rain and hail. Soon, six more hikers arrived and the hostel was full. Goldberry spent most of the day blogging and I did laundry.

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527044,"Today, Bumpy, Goldberry, and I got a ride 21 miles up the trail, to Spivey Gap, and hiked southward back to the hostel. At first, we had fresh legs and high spirits, but as the day wore on, we passed over mountains and through muddy snow until we were cold and our knees were sore. 
Because we were hiking south over a long distance, we met many more hikers than usual, both old friends and new acquaintances. Early in the day, we met super hiker Cheddar,who wanted to visit her parents in Erwin, so she hiked by headlamp through the snow to the top of big bald last night (25 mile day). She strode past, focused on the 17 miles between her and Erwin. I want to be able to hike so fast and long, but I must continue to be patient as my body slowly adapts to this life.
Hiking not far behind Cheddar, we met Owl, a young man who hiked from Conn to Maine last year and is now hiking Georgia to Conn, where he hopes to finish. We met him in Franklin, and he has been enjoyable company these few weeks. ""Why are you hiking south today?"" I asked him. ""South?!"" he responded, fear and confusion in his voice--after all, there were three of us and he surely must have gotten turned around somehow. Leaving shelters and potty breaks, going the wrong direction is easier than one would think. ""Just kidding,"" I explained to poor Owl, and I told him about our one day flip flop at Hiker Paradise. Although he laughed, Owl said he'd get me back for my little joke. I began to enjoy the prospect of similarly pranking all of the 20 friends we'd meet this day! Unfortunately, a few moments later, Goldberry demanded that I ""not do that again."" 
As we ascended, snow began to appear, first in patches and then everywhere . After seven miles of steady uphill, we reached the grassy large summit of Big Bald, with 360 degrees of mountains. It was as impressive as Max Patch, but not as uplifting. The view towards the Roan Highlands was spectacular, looking like a piece of the Presidential ridge from NH.
We hiked all day with Bumpy, whose long strides became clearly tired as our eleven hours progressed. The long downhill tithe shelter finally came, after we walked for an hour through a furious snow squall that left us covered with wet snow. We had eaten all of our food and the sun was going down. My back was starting to hurt for some reason, sharp pains in my lower right side. I was sure that my knees would be stiff in the morning!","hiker paradise

Bumpy, Goldberry, and I started up from Spivey Gap and walked leisurely to Erwin in about four and a half hours. Arriving at ""Uncle Johnny's"", we took a one hour nap and retrieved our boxes that had been mailed to the hostel. At five thirty, we took a shuttle to the Mexican restaurant / WalMart. Verge and Legs (formerly Loon) called us from Gatlinberg, where they were hiding from the cold in a hotel. 
In the restaurant, we met an amazing number of hiker groups, including the Savage group, Spike, Cheddar's friends, Portugual, the Shooting Star group, and even Turtle. The only groups missing were the groups stuck at Hogback Ridge last night, JuanDurer/Munster and the Bigfoot group. It was really nice to see so many recent friends in one place.
After dinner, I ran into Bumpy again. Goldberry and I have enjoyed hiking with him for the past week--unfortunately, he had begun to find the unpredictable living conditions in the shelters and the hostels not conducive to a good vacation.

At least we skipped the ""breakfast shuttle"" because I bought some microwaveable breakfast food in the store and prepared it for Goldberry and me. Goldberry had bought a large bag of oranges, intending to use them as trail magic, but they were very heavy, so she couldn't bring them up the trail. So, she gave me permission to wander around the grounds of the hostel as everyone prepared to go hiking, handing out oranges. Turtle and Rusty Bridges appreciated their oranges, as did many other hikers. Thanks, Goldberry!    On the way out, both of us weighed our resupply packs. Mine weighed 39 pounds and Goldberry's 37 pounds. I watched jealously as I saw ""Myfriend"" weigh his 22 pound pack (what a great trail name!).     When we finally hit the trail, I was dismayed that it was so late--10 o'clock! I was up at 6:30 and ready to go by 7:30. I expressed my dismay to Goldberry at the late start, but she did not share my frustration. We got to the first shelter, almost 5 miles of hiking. It was a nice double-decker shelter where we met ""old hiker"", a 6th grade teacher on leave of absence. Deciding to continue, we hiked steadily until 3 PM, when we encountered ""Hey Everyone"" and his family doing trail magic. They had a huge, awesome truck (more than two feet of clearance!) and gave us sandwiches and oatmeal cookie creme sandwiches and nice springwater. They were just finishing up a three hour hiker feed, but they waited until we were done. We are so greatful for this super friendly feed! I hope that we can repay ""Hey Everyone"" some day.  
Goldberry and I hiked up another fifteen hundred feet to a place called ""beauty spot,"" a grassy meadow with tremendous views. Goldberry had wanted to camp about a mile earlier, much lower in elevation where it was warmer and less windy. But I wanted the perfect view and camping spot, so we camped on Beauty Spot. We put up the tent ate dinner, bear-bagged our food into a tree, and got into our sleeping bags. An hour later, we were very cold because of the gusty frigid wind sweeping into our tent. By nine PM, I admitted my error and suggested to Goldberry that we move our camp farther along the trail to where it was more sheltered. She said it would be ok if I wanted. I hiked out and found us a nice spot about 3/4 mile along the trail. Returning, I told Goldberry about the spot and I carried my pack, the tent, our sleeping bags, and sleeping pads--still in the tent!! She carried her pack and the hiking poles. We did the move in one trip and a half hour later we were snug and warm in another campsite. I took pictures of both sites. Anyone who is reading this should know that I can only use one picture per journal entry, but I usually put at least five or six onto the trail journals picture site--you can go to that site and click through all the pictures.

How to pronounce? I must have said it 1000 times, stressing each syllable in a different way. Anyway, it was a nice large-ish mountain with a tall mossy spruce forest on the top, descending onto the ridge. When I finally caught up with Goldberry, she did not appreciate my focus on the word Unaka, so she suggested that I go on ahead. I hiked by myself to the Cherry Creek Shelter, where I chatted with Portugual and Wonder. Portugual is a travel writer. He was cracking up about the posters on the shelter that said that bears are active in this area so be careful. He kept saying that the bears were going to eat us.     We then headed out for the next 9 miles to Greesy Creek, hoping to score a place in the Greesy Creek Friendly. They say that they are NOT a hostel, because who would want to stay at a ""hostile""? As usual, I was hiking a bit ahead of Goldberry, and suddenly this big-bearded much-tattooed hiker came hustling around the corner and up the hill. It was ""Hiking Viking""! I was very excited to meet this formidable hiker, who began his southbound journey on December 2nd in Monson, Maine. He thru-hiked Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont in December and January! He's a beast. Actually, he's a viking. I included a picture of him in today's photos. After the Hiking Viking went past, I arrived at Greesy Creek Gap and saw the green blazes that headed towards the ""friendly"". 
My right ankle had been bugging me today, but I decided to hike down to the ""hostel"" and get a spot before Goldberry arrived. After all, I wouldn't like her to hike down there if there was no room at the inn. However, the trip just got longer and longer. It was all downhill and must have been 7/10 mile or more. My ankle hurt more and more, but I eventually got there and discovered that there was only room in the bunkhouse, which looked like a dark barn with bunks. So, I headed back up the hill to catch Goldberry and make sure that she knew how to get there. When I got to the Gap, I was told that she had already gone past, with Portugual and Wonder. I hustled down the trail, passed the two male hikers who told me that she was ""five minutes ahead"" and climbed the ridge, shouting Goldberry's name. She heard me and turned around, and I carried her pack to the gap and then to the ""friendly"". 
The person in charge of the ""friendly"", Sisi, is very enthusiastic and friendly. The hostel has about ten people tonight. Goldberry got to watch NCIS, one of her favorite shows.

Also, Owl's hand infection is acting up again and he and Feral Dad (foot) went to the clinic in Erwin today. So many people with injuries and infections!
We are aiming to be in Damascus in seven or eight days. It's hard to plan our daily mileage in advance because we're not sure what may start hurting, but I really need to start averaging more like 12-13 miles per day soon.

(2) The Franklin Baptist Church breakfast and superior shuttle to the trail by the nice man with the tuxedo cooking apron.

(4) The Orr Family (Hikerfamily 2015) with their cookout trail magic near Max Patch.
(5) Cap and Goose and others with their cookout trail magic near Max Patch.
(6) The cooler at the bottom of the hill after Davenport Gap and the mailbox with the food at the top of the stone stairway after the pidgeon river.
(7) Goldberry's magic down jacket that appeared in the hiker box in Franklin.
(8) The orange that Bumpy found on our 21-mile day.
(9) ""Bugs"" giving away half of his stuff when he ended his hike, including giving us some spices and some cooking fuel.
(10) ""Hey Everyone"" and his family with the huge truck giving us lunch before beauty spot several days ago.
(11) Discovering ""hiker paradise"" exactly when we needed a break on a cold day and getting a ride from a hiker mom when we got lost.

This was the first day when I wasn't asking myself ""are we there yet?,"" because the miles slid by so easily and pleasantly that we WERE there before I got a chance to ask. 
On a health note, part of my Achilles' tendon was tickling for a couple of hours. At first I thought it was a defect in my sock, but even when I changed socks, it felt like someone was tickling it with a feather. I think my running shoes might be breaking down in the heels, perhaps even starting to chafe, but I don't have hot spots or blisters yet. It sure is a weird feeling--it happens only when I am going uphill, I think. 
We met several Southbounders today (henceforth called SOBOs). None of them started this year, however--they were completing June or July starts from Baxter last year.

We got a lateish start (8:30) from the big red barn (Overmountain Shelter), leaving only Magic Man in the shelter behind us. He's a young ex-competitive runner and he usually catches up quickly.
I had told Goldberry that we could hike to Rte 19 and if we were feeling bad, go to a hostel. Or, tent along the Elk River at the 13-15 mile mark. Or, head 18 miles to the Mountaineer Shelter near the waterfall. When I caught up with her right before a big bald (she left while I was cleaning up and getting ready) I told her that my plan was to try to go 2 miles per hour for nine hours, with one hour of breaks. She replied, ""that's not my plan."" Her plan, as usual, was just to hike her pace as long as she wished, taking breaks when she wished. 
I passed her and hiked 2.5 miles per hour for four hours, reaching rte 19 at 12:30. I waited for her as Feral Dad, Granddaddy Longlegs, Magic Man, and Uncle Bob (German) passed my spot. She showed up at 2:30, not feeling great. She thought that I had taken the tent and stove on to the shelter, and she didn't want to go that far. I was cold and stiff from waiting, but fed and stretched and I'd done my ""feet chores"". However, Goldberry was worn thin by the prospect of my abandoning her, so once more we went to a hostel with a bathtub--this time it was Roan Mountain B&B.
We stopped at the local barbecue joint for dinner--it's like an Irish Pub in the sense that the whole community drops by on a daily basis and chats in a friendly way. It's amazing how fast we learned about the town from the Highlander Barbecue--the owner and other people kept coming by to chat about their town and tell us (obvious outsiders) all about it. This hike is a crash course in rural southern life!
The B&B takes in many hikers, although we were the only ones tonight. The owners are retired teacher & nurse, but now he is a struggling beekeeper (struggling because his hives keep dying out).
We will have two 13 mile days to reach Kincora Hostel (our next resupply drop) and then 50 miles to Damascus. I really want to try to do that 50 in three days, if Goldberry will agree to that goal. I'm still focused on getting back to school before Sept 1, and I would like to get back on schedule!","Overmountain Shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528223,"Today, we left our nice hostel (Roan Mountain Hostel) and hiked up some grassy hills. We saw the Clutch/Shaggy/Cooldad group at the road--they had found an injured hawk and arranged for a local vet to meet them at the road to accept this avian patient and care for it. They brought the hawk all the way down the mountain in their jacket. We leapfrogged with this group for a while, and with Cinnamon, but eventually I had to wait for Goldberry and we fell behind the others. When Goldberry caught up (around 4 PM) she announced that she wanted to hike eight more miles, and then seventeen the next day, so that she could camp by Lake Watauga. So, we hiked quickly for a while, covering another two miles or so before we saw a beautiful tentsite next to a waterfall and a nice rock cliff. I suggested that we camp there, and she readily accepted the idea. She was surprised that I didn't want to go farther, but it was late and I didn't really think that it would be healthy to go much farther that night. We had a nice fire and slept pretty well.     So, some people who read this might be confused about why I don't always just hike next to Goldberry, but instead wind up going ahead and waiting for her. People hike different speeds in different kinds of terrain--at least most people do. For example, I have relatively short legs, a low center of gravity, and a lifetime of training has given me good lungs. On steep uphills, I am pretty fast compared with most people. On gradual uphills, I am a bit fast, but not much above average. On the flats and gradual downhills, I am a bit below average--my stride is short and I have to throw in a running step once in a while to keep up with tall people (or Ed). On steep downhills, I am really pretty slow--unless it's a technical downhill with lots of rocks and roots and stuff--then, I am quite above average. Goldberry also has her preferred speeds for each kind of terrain--she's quite slow on steep uphills and technical downhills, but she has a long stride and she can really walk quickly on gradual downhills or flats. Also, some people are efficient when they take frequent breaks, but others just consider breaks a waste of time and energy. When I stop and take off my pack and sit on the ground or on a rock, I just get stiff and tired. I get EXTRA stiff and tired standing and taking a break with my pack on. I can hike all day with just a short break to change my socks--and I am perfectly comfortable eating and drinking while I hike. Goldberry stops to rest every hour or so and stops to eat, even a clif bar. All this means that if I walk patiently (more or less) behind Goldberry for too long, I get tired and frustrated, because I can't use my natural stride. This is compounded by having to take rest breaks when I'm not tired. So, it's natural that I go ahead on the steep uphills and that she would catch up on the flats and gradual downhills. It should work out all right--but it usually doesn't, so we have to be careful to let each other know when we plan to meet up again if we get separated.     I have seen very few people hiking together all the time--I know many people who meet up periodically and then tent together and share meals at the end of the day--but most people have difficulty hiking next to each other all day. Perhaps I will get better at it when I'm in better ""hiking shape"".","rte 19

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528224,"Today we awoke near a waterfall on the Laurel River. We ate our oatmeal and then Goldberry left camp early; I put away the tent and packed up my stuff after she left. The Swiss Train (Fisherman, Maggie, KrissCross, and Recon) came by a few minutes before I was ready, so I spent the next two hours trying to catch up with them. I caught up with them and Goldberry at the Stan Murray Shelter, up on the ridge after about six miles. Goldberry and I hiked seven more miles--actually I got ahead and reached Dennis Cove Road. I found the Swiss Train on the way to get sodas at Black Bear Hostel. After checking out the hostel, I bought two Guinness (yeah!) and brought one back up the trail to get Goldberry. I traded a beer for her backpack, a trade which she readily accepted. I told her that the hostel was very nice and we should stay there. I hope that we get a good night's sleep and get ready for three big days in order to reach Damascus by Tuesday. We are planning to do the next 50 miles in three days, a challenge because we hiked 13 today and our feet hurt.     At the hostel, we discovered ""the Vagabonds"" and I got to know them a bit better. They are a dad and two young kids (around eight and eleven maybe?) named Ten (the dad), Badger, and Powder. They started at Springer on February 17, and have been heading north ever since that date. They seem to be a happy and well-adjusted family (mom is in the army, I think). I also met Kismet, who is doing the trail for the second time in four years. She just ""fell in love with it last time."" One final note about kids on the trail--""moose,"" a sixteen-year-old who is hiking the trail solo, just did a 26 mile day and reached Damascus today. He was hiking with us from Standing Bear until only a few days ago, but he is really covering a lot of miles now! He has a trail journal also.

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528668,"Today was destined to be a longer day because a mom and her hiker kids had hung their bear bag wrong a few days ago. They watched the bear tear up their food and they banged their poles together and yelled at it, but it ignored them and ate their food. So, the ATC closed the Watauga Lake area to camping, to protect the bear and the hikers. They either have to educate the bear, educate the hikers, kill the bear, or kill the hikers. They are trying to educate the hikers, the easiest choice. Next is to kill the bear...but if you don't catch it in the act, it's pretty difficult to decide which bear to kill, or how to do it. Plus, it's not really the bear's fault.     So, we had to decide whether to hike 9 miles or 18 miles. We hiked past a beautiful waterfall first thing in the morning. I convinced Goldberry to get going at about 7 AM because we had such a long day ahead of us, so we began just as the trail was light enough to hike without headlamps. The gorge with the waterfall was rocky and steep up and down, but pretty. Many people had camped along the river's edge. After an hour, the trail began to rise steeply through many switchbacks up Pond Mountain to a ridge called Pond Flats, the last allowed camping spot.     Goldberry and I both made it to the top at about the same time, but Goldberry suddenly discovered that she had cell service, so she decided to sit and blog. I didn't want to sit in the hot, buggy, sun, so I told her that I'd meet her at the picnic table next to Lake Watauga, and I descended the three miles to the lake. Along the way, because there was nobody right around me, I called my friend Sam and told him about our journey thus far. He enthusiastically responded by sending dried fruit to my after-next resupply point! I was happy about the fruit, but happier to chat with Sam, because it was with Sam that I originally decided to hike the AT. At least, when I really caught the bug. Sam and I were hiking up Katahdin and we met two thru-hikers just finishing the last day of their hike. I think that one of them was named Coco. They chatted with us for a while up the hill and then we saw them at the top all emotional and happy. Sam and I thought it would be super to thru hike someday...but alas, Sam was just at the young children stage of his life. My kids, however, were just fixing to graduate from high school and leave the nest, so all I had to do was to convince my wife that she wanted to hike 2185 miles, and we were off! Anyway, it was very nice to chat on the phone with Sam.     When I got to the edge of the lake, it was interesting because (1) I took off my shoes and socks and went wading in the cool water, (2) the whole western side of the lake was enveloped in smoke from a forest fire (how are we going to hike through that?) and (3) someone named ""scooby"" came by in a pickup truck and offered me a cold drink and said that he would be cooking some dogs soon and did I want one? I was joined by Maria, Clutch, Moonboots, Savage (how can this silly girl have gotten this far, this easily?) and eventually, Goldberry. We ate burned hot dogs and relaxed until it was time to move again. It was at least 80 degrees!    We hiked on a little trail around the lake and began to get nervous about the fire and the smoke. We saw two different crews of firefighters, both clearly not locals, but crack teams that had been called in to deal with the fire--this was not a ""controlled burn"". However, they were mostly relaxing--they had been here for 20 hours (with a break) and they had it all under control. The only flames left (they said) were between the burnt area and the lake, and they decided that it could burn a bit safely in that direction. We walked along right next to smoking trees and undergrowth for about two miles, marvelling at the damage. The fire and smoke made the hot day worse, and going uphill over the dam didn't help because we had to hike on a road for a mile or so. Near a ridge, we found a cooler that had been left there for hikers with sodas and ice. We each drank a pepsi (150 calories of carbonated sugar water, making me feel bloated, but they were cold!). Goldberry wanted to just sit there and rest in the hot sun, but I decided that I could not afford to get hot and tired, so I told her that I'd meet her at the shelter (six miles farther along). She said that she'd be there ""by eight o'clock.""         I heard that it was very hard to get water at the shelter, so I filled up my two water bottles at the spring 1.5 miles before. Chris had our Aqua Mira (Chemical water treatment) so I couldn't actually drink, but at least I had water to treat. I met Portuguese, Wonder, Cooldad (who isn't a dad, but is cool), Feral Dad (who IS a dad, but isn't really feral), Maria, and Nikkei at the shelter. The view was fabulous, but I was beat.      No Goldberry. So, I hiked back without my pack so that I could carry hers when I reached her. About a mile back, I found her and relieved her of her pack. She was exhausted--she had looked for the spring, but didn't find it, so she hadn't filled her water bottles, and they were empty. We didn't really have enough water, so when we got back to the shelter, I had to go for water. I had already walked more than 20 miles today, what's a few more feet for water?    I walked up the hill about 0.3 miles and turned onto the blue blazed trail. I walked down a long hill to a flat ridge where I was sure the water would be. My feet ached. However, there was a double blue blaze, saying that the trail took a sharp turn. The water was not on the lower ridge, where I expected it. Was it worth it to continue? We really needed more water, so I headed down the steep trail to the right. I could see down the hill about a quarter mile to a rhododendron grove, where I was sure the water would be. Arriving thirsty, I discovered ANOTHER trail turn with another steep trail leading down another .25 miles into the distance. Is it worth it? Can I just turn around? Too much wasted time and energy. THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN! Finally, I got water, climbed all the way back, and arrived after sunset. Reading the shelter register later, I discovered many hilarious stories by people who went for water and ""never returned"". Don't misunderstand me--I'm grateful for the nice hard-working volunteers who found the spring and made the trail--I just would have skipped it had I only known.   Legs and Verge--TAKE NOTICE!!    Goldberry bear-bagged our food, thank goodness because there were bears in the area. Savage was hiking towards our shelter and encountered a bear in the trail about an hour after sunset, so she called Cooldad, who got up from his sleeping bag and walked back to retrieve her. I didn't know it at the time, but both of them pulled a 33 mile day the next day to go all the way to Damascus!","Dennis Cove Road

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528669,"Today was day 2 of our three day, 50-mile, rush to Damascus. It was the easiest leg, but it was quite hot and dry, with few water sources.    We hiked along a ridge for much of the day, up another ""Iron Mountain"" (makes three thus far) and through a very nice series of pastures. Monster caught up with me and I enjoyed hiking with him, although he is very fast! He is a German in his late 20's with a great attitude about life. He is also one of the fittest people I've met in a long time. He carries a 60-ish pound pack filled with food to keep him going. Except that the night before, not too far from where we were camping, a bear had got into Sojo and Oriole's bear bags and eaten all their food, so JuanDurer, Sweet Potato, Monster, and others, had given them their extra food to tide them over until Damascus. Monster saw it as a learning moment for all of them, to learn how to hang a bear bag properly. See? Educating the hikers is easier than educating the bears.     I was ahead of Goldberry again, but she had a nice time hiking through the pastures with Sweet Potato, and I sat at the shelter and put on my long clothes because the black flies had finally matured enough to be pests.       Goldberry arrived at the shelter and once more it was Feral Dad, Goldberry, and I in the shelter and Monster, Sweet Potato, JuanDurer, Portuguese, and Wonder in tents. About dinner time, we watched Moonboots and Clutch pass through trying to catch up with Savage and Cooldad. Where was Canuck, the last of their group? (Shaggy was ahead). Canuck had drunk two sodas and was so bloated that he had to take a break--he passed through at eight o'clock, vowing to catch up with the others at Low Gap. But first, since he saw Sweet Potato jamming on Juan's Banjo, he took out his Ukelele and joined her for a song or two. I really enjoy Canuck's silly, emotional, honest, sense of life. He is a Canadian who likes Badminton more than hockey! Enough said.     Finally, I was glad to finally see ""el tejano"" again after all these days. I met him on the summit of Springer Mountain as I took a picture at the very start of the trail, and I was following his trail journal each day as he grew closer. I chatted with El Tejano, Portuguese and Monster for a while, then we went to sleep, thinking of the 19 (or more) mile day ahead of us.","vandevelde shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528670,"Woke up pretty early after Feral Dad warned us that a bear was wandering through camp. Sat and ate oatmeal with el Tejano and Monster. We were on the trail by 7:30, walking up to a ridge that we followed for most of the day. Basically, today would be a 19 mile ridge walk, up and down little peaks but generally trending down from 4200 feet to 2500. Since I was a bit ahead of Goldberry again (I told her that I'd meet her a shelter at about the halfway mark) and I had service, I called my brother Ian. Even though there are people around, it's not the same as friends and family. To go on this hike, we leave all of our regular friends behind and (usually) our families. So, when we get a chance to speak with people it is refreshing. I have spoken with my mom more since I began the trail than I did when I was living 45 minutes away from her. So, I chatted with my brother until El Tejano came up behind me. I think that it's rude to chat on the phone when people are hiking with you (unless you ask permission), so I hung up and talked with El Tejano. What a gentleman he is! On the trail, it is so much easier to get to know people than in ""real life"". El Tejano is kind and soft spoken. He is a runner who has run his share of marathons and he is very close to his supportive wife and kids, who will be joining him on the trail again farther north. El Tejano is faster than I am, however, so he passed me and went on towards Damascus. At the shelter where I awaited Goldberry, I met FeralDad again. I leapfrogged with him all day until Virginia. Goldberry and I arrived in Damascus at about five PM. Her feet were cramping, which hurts and makes the downhills slow, and my running shoes had finally self-destructed in one heel and were cutting into my heel causing an abrasion, so I was slow. I stopped and tried to fix it with duct tape and I eventually put on two socks, but nothing really helped. Fortunately, I predicted that my shoes would fail and I ordered a new pair from REI to be delivered to Damascus.     In Damascus, we found Cheddar, McFly, Slam, ...well, actually everyone that we know. The fire and the bears had bunched everyone up and those who were ahead of us had taken a zero day, so everyone was here. We wandered the streets until we found the ""HikeIn"" to stay in. Tomorrow, I will go to the post office to get our boxes.     We ate dinner at HeyJoe's restaurant. We ordered and ate, but as we were eating, Feral Dad and Creature entered and asked to eat with us. We told them that the food we had ordered was excellent and of course they could join us. But most of the food was ""out"" and they had to settle for less desireable items. As we were finishing our food, several more of our friends entered to eat (almost 7 PM) and the waiter told them that the restaurant was ""out of food"" and gave them free beers. One of them was Odie, the man who publishes the hiker yearbook. We chatted with him for a while--he is staying at Crazy Larry's. This town is full of hostels, but no real hotels (Woodchuck Hostel, Crazy Larry's, The Place, etc...). The whole town will be full in Mid-May for the ""trail days"" celebration.     We went to bed full, clean, and comfortable, looking forward to a ""zero"" day.","double spring shelter

Walked to the post office and picked up three boxes--the one I sent from Dahlonega with ""bounce-box"" stuff, the one Paul and Carol sent for resupply (yay, food!) and a box from REI with my new LaSportiva running shoes. The resupply box also contained my lighter-weight sleeping bag, so I sent home my heavy, warmer, feathered friends bag. To get the two large boxes and the small box back, a man in the post office parking lot volunteered to drive me. I thanked him, put my boxes in the back, and entered the car.     My ""trail angel"" driver was Mr. Montgomery, a man of few words, who probably didn't encourage chat because he couldn't hear me well. He was ninety-eight years old. He has lived here way longer than that ""newfangled hiking trail they made a few years ago."" It is always nice to meet a person who have lived almost a century!     I got a haircut at a local barbershop ($12, next to HeyJoe's Mexican Restaurant). I look much cleaner and possibly younger now. I checked out the local outfitters, buying fuel for my stove, aqua mira, and a new compression dry stuffsack (smaller sleeping bag, smaller stuffsack). Also, I was fed up with the large buckles on my outdoor research stuffsack. The large buckles always found a way to stick into my back through my backpack.     Returning home, I found Goldberry feeling a bit sick to her stomach and stewing over the longer miles that we have done lately. It's the same tradeoff--if we go shorter (10 miles per day?) Goldberry will feel better and we won't be as tired. We might enjoy the trip more! But, I really want to complete the whole trail by September 1st, so that I can get back to work. They gave me a very nice sabbatical to do the trail--it would inconvenience a lot of people at school if I arrived late, and I would miss out on a big part of the trip if I didn't finish the trail. So, I have to try to average fifteen miles per day. Leaving Goldberry wondering if there's anything that we can do to make the trip more enjoyable. Maybe we will slackpack tomorrow (hike along the trail with only day packs and then hitch back into town and stay in the hostel one more day.

Then, suddenly, I passed the same farm six times, each time a hundred feet higher in altitude (switchbacks). The trail continued to climb and I hiked quickly, averaging over three miles per hour for the whole day. This was possible because I had only a day pack, having left my regular backpack with Goldberry in Damascus.     At about noon, I glimpsed the next days' mountains, Mount Rogers and the Grayson Highlands; they towered over the hills through which I was hiking. I saw very few people before I got to the road crossing at about seventeen miles, and I had to walk three more miles before the hiking grandmothers picked me up.

We hiked slowly up a steep clung for three hours to Buzzard's Rock in light rain and fog, then the darker clouds rolled in and doused us for three hours. I was wearing ""sealskinz"" waterproof socks, which I had tested last fall by hiking up Wachusett after a rainstorm and stepping in each stream--my feet stayed dry!    On this day, however, it felt like my shoes were completely filled with water--but they were mesh running shoes, so how was the water filling them? I discovered that water had been running down my legs and had filled my socks, which were not permeable enough to let it out as fast as it was entering. The cold bags of water around my ankles were providing false support and numbing them so I wouldn't feel pain as I gradually injured them.     At a road crossing, I changed socks and chucked them in the trash. Goldberry didn't want to wait in the cold rain, so she went ahead. Sleet began to mix in with the rain.

Goldberry wanted the bottom floor due to the ladder. Good thing, too, because a kid upstairs smoked marijuana for hours up there, fumigating everyone. Downstairs was muddy, though, from everyone's boots. There were six hikers upstairs and five downstairs, including Diesel and Cold Snap, a couple from the North Shore (MA) and Brawny, a second-time thru hiking woman, and DuckBat & Storyteller, two late twenty-somethings from MA. There was also a couple asleep upstairs that we would meet the next day, Rainy & Trip.     Many people stopped by, but as the shelter was crowded and the rain had lightened, they went on. The next section of the trail is very popular due to the grassy open highlands and wild ponies. During the night, it stormed, with roaring high winds and sheets of rain.

I could see lightning and thunderstorms all around me in every direction.     When Goldberry arrived at about two PM we decided to call it a day early. We would have to make up the short day by hiking four straight 15-mile days. We changed clothes, I built a big fire, and we got out our sleeping stuff. Goldberry found a sudoku book and did some sudokus. Eventually, ""CrissCross"" and ""Sunray"" arrived, a young couple from Switzerland. As the rain came and went, they decided to stay also. The Spaniard stopped by but decided to go and do another ten miles, so we said ""adios"" to ""the spaniard"" and we had a nice evening cooking and sitting near the fire with the Swiss. Two more hikers arrived and the shelter was pretty full. I'm glad that we stayed there because it rained very hard for much of the night, but we were snug as bugs in rugs.  
One more thing must be mentioned about this night--one of the hikers who arrived late in the evening was a world-class snorer. He stopped breathing altogether and then finally started with a great rush of noise and bluster, but then tailed off into a traditional sawing-wood snore, except much louder than usual. Every once in a while, he added in a few loud words or a shout and then some mumbling. His noise was driving the Swiss and my wife crazy. They all wanted to get up and do some night hiking, but it was midnight still thundering and lightning. We made it through the night, but I'm the only one who got a normal amount of sleep (except for perhaps the snorer!). And, before you ask, everyone had earplugs--but this guy was so loud that it wasn't enough protection!","Knot Maul Shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530447,"We got started pretty early today, since Goldberry did not sleep well, we just wanted to get going before the rain came back. The morning's hike was up and down along an undulating ridge that formed the volcanic ""cone"" around Burke Garden. We had a cool breeze for most of the morning, but about one pm, the sun came out and the day became hot. We didn't see any other nobos, but we passed some sobos. After about fifteen miles, we found a nice tentsite beside Laurel Creek and settled down for the night. Although it only rained a bit, it was very humid and everything in the tent was damp all night. I didn't sleep well, but Goldberry did. She still enjoys the tent more than shelters, but I like the extra space of a shelter, as long as it's half-empty--nobody likes a full shelter.","Chestnut Knob shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530489,"Today, we awoke damp from our humid night beside Laurel Creek. After walking one minute in the morning, we discovered that we had camped just short of a much better campsite! This happens so often that it's kind of a joke--sometimes we stop for a lunch break in the hot sun and when we get up to go, discover that if we had only gone a few more feet down the trail, we could have had a shady picnic table and a good water source with a view....but instead, we sat on a wet un-level log. Happens all the time.     Anyway, today we covered ten miles quickly, only to look a the map and discover that there were no good water sources for any tentsites over the next nine miles! So, we set ourselves and headed up onto the next ridge to do a 19-mile day. Secretly, I was happy about this, because it would make one of the next two days shorter. We were on a schedule--we had to get to the Woods Hole Hostel by Sunday.     It was a long, dry, hot, day; the first half was flat, cool, ridgewalking. The second half of the day was up-and-down ridgewalking, and the sun came out with a vengeance and made us wish we had more water. We climbed up onto the second ridge with four liters of water, but we had none left by the time we arrived at Jenny's Knob shelter (almost six PM). We met El Tejano there, Farmer, and a new hiker doing his second thru-hike named Optimistic Dreamer. Goldberry was tired--she had the energy to filter water, eat dinner, and chat, but then we both went to the tent pretty early. The tent was on a slant, so Goldberry didn't sleep that well again. Also, when she has long days, her muscle aches often make it hard for her to sleep.","laurel creek tent

We said goodbye to El Tejano, Optimistic Dreamer, and Farmer and set out on a quick seven miles to a narrow bridge across a river. We had information that there was a grocery store that cooked burgers and stuff a half-mile down the road at the first road crossing! We found the store and ate cheeseburgers, fries, and milkshakes. It wasn't raining, but it looked like it would rain soon! We bought a ham and cheese sub and some chocolate milk ""to go"" and headed up to ""Dismal Falls"". It was a nice swimming hole with a waterfall cascading down into it. We saw that Red Bear and Doc were already camped there. They had made a fire and were headed back into town to buy beer.     We stayed at the falls and swam for a while. Then, it began to rain. Goldberry and I disagreed about whether to set up our tent and stay at the falls. She wanted a short day and I was worried about the rain and long day tomorrow. After Doc and Red Bear returned, we stood around for a while in the rain and got wet and cold. Eventually, Goldberry saw how miserable I was becoming, so she put on her hiking clothes and agreed to head back out on the trail. We did a quick 6+ miles, ending up at the infamous ""Wapiti Shelter"" (google it). This shelter is also nice for me to visit because my school, the Winchendon School, has ""Wapiti"" for a mascot.    At the shelter, it quickly began to rain harder. We ate dinner and went to sleep at around 8 PM, hiker midnight.","Jenny's Knob Shelter

After eating our oatmeal and relaxing for almost two hours, it looked as though the rain was becoming lighter, so we headed up the trail. Naturally, the rain intensified gradually until it was flat-out pouring. Because it was still warm, I chose not to wear my rain gear, but instead just a t-shirt and my pack cover. I discovered that my pack cover was large enough to pull over my head like a turtle! This helped during the deluge, since the cold water on my forehead gives me quite a chill. We hiked in the rain for about two hours. On our way over the shoulder of ""Sugar Run Mountain,"" the trail became a river, and we walked in the river for an hour. On the ridge, the rain slowed and the sun came out a few times. Not for the last time, we were walking on a narrow strip of rock and trees, surrounded on both sides by clouds below us. After eight miles, we reached Sugar Run Road and walked the half-mile downhill to the Woods Hole Hostel. This was a log-cabin hunting lodge that was discovered by a couple in 1940, who restored it and made it into a hostel. It is now being run by the original couple's granddaughter and her husband, who have been running the hostel for seven years thus far.     The Woods Hole Hostel is an organic farm / hostel with a bunkhouse, goats, pastures, woods, a wonderful kitchen, and private rooms for those who wish to rent them. It has an atmosphere that encourages everyone to pitch in and help. It is clean, pretty, and warm. Goldberry and I bought fresh loaves of bread and a big block of cheddar for lunch. For dinner, we will have ""mountain gumbo"" (we'll see). It is still raining off and on, but the rest of today will surely be relaxing.","Wapiti Shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531032,"Today, I woke to the smell of fresh-roasted coffee. The verdict is in--the ""Woods Hole Hostel"" is top-notch! Neville and Michael do a great job communicating expectations and setting the emotional tone. The smoothies and fresh bread and cheese and stuff is extra--the most important thing is the friendship and comfort that surround the hostel.     Goldberry's parents are coming to visit! In addition to being a generally fun time, this means that I will be hiking without a pack today because they will get me at the end of my hike and bring my pack! I enjoyed a superior breakfast at the hostel and then took off down the trail at nine AM. Better late than never!     Knowing that when I am alone, I have a tendency to hike too fast for too long and then get injured, I focused on hiking smoothly this morning. I did not listen to books or to music or anything, but stayed focused on not slipping on the wet rocks and not overstriding and not getting my feet prematurely wet. I stayed alert to my pulse and whether I was overheating or becoming dehydrated. I covered just over three miles in the first hour, up from the hostel onto a ridge. Then, three more miles in the second hour. I was moving quietly and deliberately, striding loosely and trying not to overstride. I was so focused on the trail that I almost hit a deer! I noticed the deer pull up his (or her) head sharply about three feet from my right elbow, and take a quick step away from me. I was more startled than the deer, but just kept moving. The deer didn't seem bothered, and went back to doing whatever deer do.     To make me humble, I was overtaken by another hiker, ""Ginger Patch"", a tallish youngster with a full pack and very long legs. He actually didn't pass me--as soon as he reached me, he noticed a privy at ""Doc's Knob Shelter"" and left the trail. However, he finally ended up passing me an hour later going up Peirs Mountain.   I hope that I can hike as fast as he does someday, but I guess it's probably genetic.     I passed Doc on the way down the two mile descent into Pearisburg. His ankle must be better, because he is making good time. They re-routed the trail through the town and it is much more beautiful, with no road walking, but the new trail has little vegetation on it yet and is impossibly muddy and slippery. At the Pears Cemetery, I met Champa (Live Free tattooed across his knuckles) and Get Weird (blond dreadlocks). I enjoy their company, but I went up the hill a bit too fast for their full packs to keep up.     After fifteen miles, I found ""Pocahontas Road"" and tried to hitch back to town to meet Goldberry and her parents. Unfortunately, nobody picked me up and I walked four miles along the road. I was hit by a big storm that I ducked by going into a feed store for a few minutes. In the store, I discovered straw hats on sale from $25 to $6, so I bought one. Fate! When I hiked into Pearisburg again, I found Goldberry, Paul, and Carol (the Gold-parents) and we all went to the comfort in in Blacksburg. What a day!","Woods Hole Hostel

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531709,"Today, I began the day with a nice breakfast in the Comfort Inn in Blacksburg. Paul and Carol drove me to Pocahontas Road, where I stopped the previous day, with my pack. I hit the trail with a will, but soon discovered that the previous day's storm had wreaked havoc on the trail. The hailstones were so large and so much fell that it had stripped the new leaves from all of the trees--even the pine needles! Walking along the trail, there was a thick coating of green leaves on the ground, but none on the trees. As I rose in elevation, I found that there were still piles of hail on the ground--in some places three inches deep. I reached down and took a handfull of hailstones from the ground and discovered that some of the hail was more than an INCH in diameter--and this was more than twelve hours after the hail fell, at around 45 degrees! I met three hikers heading down the trail the wrong way because they had to go to an outfitter to buy a new tent--they had been unlucky enough to have set up their tent early in the afternoon and the tent had been cut to ribbons by the hail. I also met a man with purple welts down his arms that had been caused by the hail as be put his arms over his head to protect himself. Others had bumps and bruises on their heads. I saw six dead birds on the trail (some pictures of the hail and a dead bird are in my photo section).     Fortunately, most of my friends were ok. I met Doc along the trail, hiking with him for an hour. At about the four mile mark, a serious thunderstorm was coming, and I decided to try to race the eight miles to the next shelter, just to see whether I could wait out the storm there. Along the way, I ran into El Tejano again, who had passed me before Woods Hole. Racing along at a bit less than three miles per hour, I passed many unfamiliar hikers. I missed the shelter by about ten minutes, getting a little wet, but not soaked. The streams were still swollen from the storms the night before, but the new rain also caused the water levels to rise again. There were new streams all over the place, in the trail and over the trail. I was tired, but I really didn't want to quit after only 12 miles, so when the rain lightened up, I headed out. The stream crossings were very tough, and several times I had to go up or downstream and improvise new crossings. I passed the ""Captain's Place,"" a zip-line from the trail across a large stream where a property owner allows hikers to tent on his lawn and gives them free sodas. From there, it was only four miles to another shelter, giving me a 19-mile day, if I could get there in the mud and streams. Little did I know that it would be two miles of flat and then two miles of really steep uphill. Fortunately, the steep uphill brought me out of the muck and humid damps and onto a ridge with a bit of a breeze. At the next shelter, I discovered El Tejano, who had all of his wet clothing spread out on trees and bushes. Nobody else showed up--they were all crowded into the wet shelters and tentsites further down the hill. We had a nice relaxing evening planning the next day's 21-day hike (depending on the weather!).
El Tejano has a great journal on Trailjournals as well. He is a really strong hiker who began the same day as Goldberry and I. I gave him some charge for his phone and some Swedish Fish, and he gave me some chocolate and a piece of cheese. He has two days of food left to reach Four Pines, his next resupply. 
I missed Goldberry today, but with the hail and the rain and new people and challenging myself to go farther, I was quite busy.","Pocahontas Road

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531710,"Today was one of my hardest days on the trail. It rained off and on during the day, causing streams to form in the trail and filling my running shoes with muck. I hiked 21 miles, leapfrogging El Tejano, who stopped and stretched and ate at the shelters that we passed. One interesting thing that we saw was the ""cairns"" on Bruiser's Knob, large piles of well-cut stone that must have been from old stone buildings or a road or something, that were piled into heaps way up on the ridge. I included some pictures of them in my photo section. Much of the day was spent walking over long ridges and then through cow pastures. I also passed the second-largest oak on the trail (largest in the south). It was a truly massive tree.     When I finally got to the shelter, it was more than a half-mile down off of the trail, straight down off the ridge. However, it was a nice shelter and El Tejano was there as well. I put my sleeping pad under a bird's nest, the only remaining spot, and hoped that it would not poop on my bedding.     The next day was planned to be the toughest day yet, a 23-mile day to 4-Pines Hostel, after hiking over Dragon's Tooth.     One interesting thing is that I have reached ""zero net pack weight"". I have lost 38 pounds and my pack weighs 36 pounds fully supplied with water and food. That means that I weigh less with my pack now than I did without it when I started at Springer Mountain.

I figured that if it started so early, it would tail off in the morning, but it didn't. El Tejano and I hiked out by 6:30 AM, hiking up the steep ridge and following along the top for six miles to the next shelter. The trail was very technical, with rocks and ""knife edges"" and lots of places to slip and get injured. So I fell pretty hard and broke my hiking pole, which made it even harder because I am used to stabilizing myself and balancing with two poles. Fortunately I was just bruised and wet. We were soaked to the bone and very cold by ten AM.     Shaggy and Stripe joined us at the shelter. Shaggy was talking about calling it a day after six miles, just to get warm and dry. El Tejano and Stripe left. I finally said that I had to go, after waiting almost an hour for the rain to let up. It was ten miles of up and down--two significant climbs at least, to the next shelter. After six miles, I met Stripe and we went down a short side trail to the Audie Murphy memorial. He died on that very mountain (Brush Mountain) when his plane crashed. He was the most decorated US soldier of all time, including the Medal of Honor. Since memorial day is coming up, I got a photo of the memorial (of course, he is buried at Arlington Cemetery).     Stripe (he had an encounter with a skunk early on the trail) hiked faster than I did, so I was alone fighting the rain and the dark clouds. I wondered how far Tejano was going. At five PM, I reached the next shelter, a half mile off the trail in a meadow. Only Stripe was there, and the two of us hung up wet clothes and tried to dry out a bit. Where was Tejano? After a while, we were joined by the two Swiss, Sunray and Krisskross. It was pleasant the share the shelter with them, as we had shared a shelter at Chestnut Knob. Also, Champa and Get Weird came to the shelter and cooked, but they tented up the hill. It had been a long day in the rain, and my right hamstring was hurting, so I didn't think that I could go eight more miles over Dragon's Tooth that evening. I decided to start very early the next day to get to the 4-Pines hostel early.     I am really impressed by El Tejano. When he went out into the rain, knowing that he was not scared of the rain and pain gave me courage also. I imagined that he had hiked a few more miles, but didn't want to waste miles hiking off the trail to the shelter.

When I reached the 4 Pines Hostel (he made a nice hostel out of his garage) I did laundry and had a shower. I retrieved my resupply box and then left my backpack to pick up later and hiked the next six miles to the road near McAfee Knob. On the way, I ran into Spike (nice German with a big beard and a kilt) and Trooper (Scottish girl). They have been ahead of us for two weeks, so it was nice to see them. When I got the road, Paul and Carol brought Goldberry to pick me up and we all went to dinner and Howard Johnson's. We had a good meal in Daleville, where the trail will bring us in a day or two.

The weather was great and we had missed the early morning crowd.     It took a bit less than two hours to reach the Overlook. We took some pictures and stretched a bit. On the way out, Goldberry saw a deer and got some good pictures of its rear end. We hiked to Tinker Cliffs, passing some gorgeous campsites and shelters along the way. It was a bit of steep up and down getting to the cliffs, but the view from there is just as amazing as McAfee knob, but without the crowds.     We hiked down to Lambert Meadows, where there has been some bear activity lately. After we got water, it rained on us for a bit. These meadows are also beautiful tentsites, but we didn't even have our tent or sleeping bags with us--we had left them in Daleville--so we had to hike 20 miles or sleep on the ground.    We met very few thru hikers, just a few boy scout groups. After mile fifteen, we began to get tired. It didn't help that the trail layout made it appear that we were almost done, then just kept sending us up more rocky inclines over and over. Finally, after the sixth time passing some power lines, the trail snaked downwards and we hobbled to the road. Thank heaven--we had been hiking since before nine AM, and it was after seven PM when we arrived.     I got spaghetti and pizza to go at the pizza hut and we checked in to the Howard Johnson's again. There are many hikers here because the trail crosses the road right next door.     My knee began to hurt towards the end of the hike, so I was very careful to tread smoothly and lightly. Currently, it doesn't hurt, but when I put my pack on tomorrow and go up the hill (it's always uphill out of towns), who knows?     I miss my kids.

Kudus to Homer and the rest of the team that does local trail work.     Rising up out of the valley, the rocks turned to reddish gravel and the trees became pines and oaks. It was dry terrain, punctuated by streams in the ravines. Over the fifteen miles, I saw Two-socks with his bright red beard, Trouper, Spike, Stripe, and Ralphie. Also, the two German Women and the Bright Bags/Stitch/Bevo/Secret Agent group.     More importantly, I startled a large black bear that was minding his own business on the trail. He looked up at me and took off at a blistering pace into the woods, smashing down shrubs and bushes. I have always heard that the bears could run fast, but this was as fast as a startled greyhound, and a lot larger! Today I also saw an unusual number of deer who seemed quite unafraid of me. I got a few pictures of their deer-butts, because for some reason they always seemed to be pointed that way at me.     I finished my hike at the Black Horse Gap, next to the Blue Ridge Parkway.

It will be in the 30's for the next two mornings, so I will over my legs and keep the muscles warm.","Hog Stamp Gap

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533246,"Today we got to get caught up on the blogs and eat a nice breakfast before heading out to climb ""Three Ridges"", which starts at 900 feet and quickly rises to 4000 again! It was a cool morning, so this climb was not as sweaty as usual. We knew it would be around freezing, with gusty winds that night, and we were not excited about trying to stay warm.    The hike was cool for most of the day. It really was a big climb, and the last bit was the toughest, a sort of ""devil's tower"" promontory which was as steep as the peak at Albert Mountain. There were many wildflowers--I have never seen so many at once. When we finally got to the shelter, it was almost four PM. There were three college boys there on a weekend in the woods. I helped them to build a fire and then they asked Goldberry and me a hundred questions about thru-hiking. Usually, there would be many thru hikers at the shelter or tentsites, but many people were still on their way back from ""trail days"", so half of the thru hikers were missing.     I was very relieved and happy to speak with Verge finally. I still wanted to talk to Legs, but she was still out to Traildays. Verge had been doing work for stay at the Woods Hole Hostel for a couple of days.     That night, Goldberry and I were cold, but not shivery cold--it never actually went below freezing and the breeze couldn't really bother us in this shelter. I think that was the last cold night of the trip, unless it gets cold again in Maine or NH--but it was in the nineties last time we were in Baxter State Park.","VA Route 56

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533458,"Today was an ""easy"" fifteen miles that was harder than it should have been because of a mountain that kept moving backwards and several spots with rocks. As I may have mentioned before, all terrain is either ""steep"" (1-2 miles per hour) or ""flat"" (2-3 miles per hour). It doesn't matter whether it is uphill or downhill, and there's no such thing as ""mostly flat"" or ""a bit uphill""--if it isn't ""steep"" then it's all the same to me. SO, if there's excessive rocks or mud, I add the word ""technical"", which subtracts one mile per hour. Today was mostly flat, except for a mile or so of ""steep"", and two miles of ""technical"". We also wasted quite a bit of time on breaks.     Breaks are when people stop walking and inexplicably just sit down on rocks or wet logs in the cold wind for the purpose of chilling their already-warmed-up muscles, hoping that these muscles cramp or pull as a result. I don't understand breaks. For example, if I were running a half-marathon, I don't think that it would help my speed or happiness any to stop every kilometer and sit on a bench for thirty seconds. Especially if I were to stop for five or ten minutes! Anyway, many hikers insist on taking ""breaks"". I don't. In fact, I hate 'em (not the hikers, the breaks). Obviously, if I have to take a pee break or repack my pack because a sharp object is poking into my spine, I have to take a break, but these things are not optional. I also prefer to drink water or eat snacks while I walk. When I began this trek, I couldn't reach behind me far enough to get my water bottles from my pack without taking off the pack, but now it's easy for me.         We passed a very silly ski resort called ""Evergreen"" which appears to have been built just to sell rich people some condos. And, I have to point out that this section of trail is being maintained by the Old Dominion Trail Club. Many sections of trails have been adopted by colleges or universities--I think that this practice was started by Dartmouth, who maintains the section from Hanover to Moosilauke. Anyway, ODU has done an outstanding job in the first 20 miles of this section. The signs are clear, unobtrusive, and nice looking. The trail is beautifully maintained and the Paul Wolfe Shelter (last night) was large, well-designed, and comfortable.    When we were passing over the Humpback Mountain, we were taking a break when ""Pony"" walked by. He had actually hiked with Verge and Legs (then Loon) for a couple of days and remembered them well. Pony is about the third hiker who has met our daughters and then caught up with us. Pony was also completely out of food, so we gave him some trail mix, a cliff bar, and some beef jerky.        I hiked with Goldberry (actually, behind her) for about ten miles and then decided that I wanted to go on ahead and hike my own pace for the rest of the day. This has been happening quite a bit. When I arrived at the shelter, it was beside a loud, pretty stream. There was a bench in front of the shelter with a plaque commemorating the life of an ODU trail maintainer who died hiking the PCT. The shelter was two-floors. The only other hiker to arrive was Sharky, whom we had met the previous day. Goldberry arrived and approved of the shelter. We ate dinner and saw Maria/""Push"" and Teatime pass through on their way to Waynesboro.     After we had eaten our meal (the last meal in our packs, because we would hike to Waynesboro to resupply in the morning), a man hiked up to the shelter. His name was Hans, and he'd hiked the AT in 2013. He is a former marine who is now a 30-ish year-old college student studying engineering. Anyway, he liked this spot during his thru-hike, so he hiked up to sleep in his hammock next to the waterfalls (yes, we had waterfalls).  Hans brought TWO large pizzas to the shelter, sharing part of one with ""Pony"" on his way up. These pizzas were not for Hans--he had already eaten--he just brought them up to make hungry hikers happy! This is called ""Trail Magic"", and Pizza is about the best kind! After a while, Fisherman and Maggie came in and there were four pieces of pizza left for them.","Maupin Field shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533589,"Today's goal was to get to Waynesboro fairly dry and get our chores done. I awoke at 4:45, waited patiently until 5:20, and then suggested to Goldberry that we get going. We had cold breakfast to tide us over and were on the trail by 6:20. Hans also got up early and was on the trail at the same time. I chatted with Hans for most of the five miles. Goldberry kept up fine until the end, but when she arrived at the highway, Hans and I were waiting for her because Hans had volunteered to drive us to Waynesboro (five miles). He drove us to the ""quality inn"", which looks like it was a comfort inn, but poorer and older. We were pretty soaked by the constant rain all morning.        We wandered over towards the post office in the rain and found a breakfast place because we couldn't check in until 12 noon. We left our packs with a young thru-hiker named ""Just Matt"". At breakfast, we wanted to buy one entree each and then split a plate of french toast, but the owner just gave us two plates of french toast for the price of one. Also, there was a man in the shop who is a ""trail angel"" who volunteered to drive us back to the hotel with our boxes (it was still raining).     While Goldberry waited to check us in, I walked to the grocery store and got cheerios and banannas and yogurt. I also went to CVS to get epsom salts and emery boards and tums and dry skin lotion to make feet softer. I found a laundromat, returned to Goldberry, took a shower, unpacked our boxes and repacked the food for tomorrow, then walked out to do laundry at the coin-operated laundromat. Now, I'm blogging back at the hotel office on the public keyboard while the clothes dry.   I still need to get to the outfitter (two miles at least) to buy more fuel for our stove.    So, I'm clean, dry, and fed (looking forward to Chinese food tonight), hoping that the rain stops tomorrow morning early, because we are starting the Shenendoahs (the Shennys, as people are calling them).","Paul Wolf shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533820,"Today, after a long planning discussion with Goldberry, I got a ride from Waynesboro to the ""Saw Mill Overlook"" on Skyline Drive from the ""Yellow Truck"" shuttle. My legs were really tired before yesterday, and I wasn't sure how much they recovered. Although I only walked five miles of AT yesterday, I walked at least twelve, back and forth to two grocery stores, the laundromat, and the pharmacy. But instead of taking a ""zero"" day today, I got a ride ten miles up the trail and hiked back to Waynesboro, hitching back via the outfitter, where I bought gas for our stove and a new shirt. My wool shirts have been great--they are warm when it is cold and cool when it is hot. They also completely fail to hold sweaty smells if they are allowed to dry. Unfortunately, the mice have attacked them a bit and I have mistakenly ripped them several times, so they are not really very wearable any more.     Walking in a southerly direction gave me another opportunity to say hi to many of the hikers that recently passed us, including Push (Maria), JuanDurer, House, George, Sister, and Fisherman & Maggie. Today's walk would have been wonderful, but instead was just nice. The threat of rain, leftover mud from yesterday's rain, and some mosquitoes downgraded the pleasant walk from ""four stars"" to ""three stars"". However, there was lush green grass, wildflowers, meadows, rolling hills (my favorite) and even some nice rocks to hike over. It was cool enough that I needed less than a liter of water for the ten miles.      I have been thinking more while I walk lately, thinking of what I want to change in my life when I return to Gardner and to school. I don't know whether this trip is initiating new changes or just helping to accelerate the lifestyle and personality changes that were already taking place. Probably both.    On this journey, I can easily escape the conventions of everyday life. Frequently, I find myself going to bed at 6 PM or eating meals when I am hungry, rather than at traditional mealtimes. It's really nice not having electric light around to alter our natural rhythms (we have headlamps, but most people use them just for hiking in the dark, going to the bathroom at night, and packing up early in the morning.     Tomorrow, Goldberry and I will head out on our longest stretch without a resupply, 110 miles to the town of Front Royal.

It was a momma bear, two smaller bears, and a much smaller one. They were not afraid of us, but they walked away, probably following the momma' command.     Also, we spent much of the day walking through forest fire areas.

We didn't sleep great from 3 to 6, when we got up and started packing. Because it was raining, we skipped the usual oatmeal and opted for carnation instant breakfast (thanks, Tejano) and a peanut butter wrap each. We hiked quickly the ten miles to Big Meadow Lodge, where we were going to spend the night out of the rain.    The room would not be ready until 3, so we walked to the campground nearby and took five minute coin-operated showers and then did our laundry. We even fluffed our sleeping bags and washed our running shoes. Arriving back at the lodge, we ate lunch, took naps, ate dinner, and planned the next day's hike.

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534609,"So, even after staying in the nice lodge last night, Goldberry and I wanted to stay in a shelter in tonight's thunderstorms. Since the shelter was a smaller one, and was sixteen miles away, the problem was how to get there before the twenty or so other hikers who wanted to stay there. The answer seemed obvious--wake up early and hike fast. However, it would be raining in the morning and the lodge serves a nice breakfast at 7:30 AM.   So...send Bombadil out in the dark rain at 6 AM and let him hike 15 miles by noon, securing shelter spots for him and his lady, who would sleep in and enjoy breakfast. Problem solved!    It was rocky and wet for the first three hours, mostly uphill past the first shelter, the leaky one (Rock Springs Hut). After the first eight miles, I stopped at the Skyline resort for a mocha latte and a ham and cheese sandwich. I'm glad I did, because I'd been fueled by only a carnation instant breakfast and a cliff bar, which weren't enough calories.    About calories: my diet is crazy lately. I eat whenever possible, both planned trail meals and junk food restaurant meals of opportunity. I eat a whole pizza by myself in towns and also throw in a burger and fries and a salad. So far, I've lost at least 42 pounds--probably more.    Anyway, I strolled two more miles, sipping my latte and listening to vocal jazz in the mist as I ascended and descended hawkbeak mountain and stony top. Then, discovering a picnic area, I filled up my water at a drinking fountain and threw away my trash in the appropriate dumpster. They even had bathrooms!    I passed over ""the pinnacle"", an easy 1000 foot climb and came to #3 Birds Nest Shelter, inhabited only by two southbound section hikers.      I claimed two spots, putting my sleeping pad and bag out.

I spent a long time sweeping and arranging our space. A southbound girl from Amherst College stayed there--really young, but a strong hiker. Also two UMASS sophomores heading from Waynesboro to Harper's Ferry. And JuanDurer (tent) and Magic Man and a girl named MacGuyver, who tented.     At about eight PM, while I was starting to sleep and Magic was teaching the youngsters a card game, a 25-ish man arrived with black hair, running shoes, and a very light pack, introducing himself as ""endless"". I remembered that Legs and Verge met him at Four Pines and he told them, ""I'll catch up to your parents"". Well, in just a couple weeks, he caught up 200 miles! Turns out that he did 79 miles over the past two days, practicing for the 4 state challenge. He took the last spot in the shelter, first crunching down some sort of stove less meal before curling up in his too-thin blanket. He was up with me at 5 AM and away by 5:30. Go, ""Endless""! I wish I could do miles like that. I hope to begin doing longer days soon.    I spent most of the day relaxing (while walking) and protecting my knees. I reached the ""Cabbin"" hostel at 2 PM, leaving the SNP and passing an ominous, fenced-in area that reminded me of Jurassic Park. After a shower, Goldberry arrived and we got a shuttle to Laundry and Mexican food. My new running shoes arrived!   I got 460 miles from the first pair and 500 from the second.

It was very hot gravel and mud, with cyclists on mountain bikes going both ways and sporadic hikers and joggers. We also saw many large algae-covered turtles on logs and rocks in the canal.    The trail rose steeply and became rockier into Maryland (we entered Maryland when we crossed the Potomac). After many switchbacks, it straightened out and reached the Ed Garvey shelter, where a few hikers were getting water. Goldberry wanted to nap there, but it was hot so I went along alone.

The joint is still swollen and it hurts when I put weight on the forefoot.     Surprisingly, the rocks did not get bothersome for quite a few miles. We passed through some fields and over a steep hill. I met FittyShrimp, a 2013 thru-hiker who had followed up his trip by reuniting with trail buddies and hiking the PNT. Chatting with him helped pass the miles over mud and rocks. He was just doing a couple quick days to the Penn border and back. When I arrived at the Ensign Cowall shelter, he was chatting with a bunch of hikers, mostly about my own age or older. This campsite was not good for tenting--all rocky and steep--but I found a spot and set the tent up for Goldberry (and me, if I decided to stay there).      When she arrived, she suggested that we order pizza from the ""Rocky's Pizza"", who delivers to the parking lot next to the previous road crossing. OK, I answered, and ordered enough pizza for us and some extra to give away. The parking lot was pretty far away, a bit less than a mile, over a stream and through some mud. I sat on a rock and awaited pizza.   After about twenty minutes, my lower back felt as though it were on fire! I jumped up and saw that the Rock and surrounding area were covered with thousands of tiny red ants. So were my legs, shorts, and shirt. I took off my shirt and began shaking it, but none of the ants came off--I would have to pinch each off individually. I was able to brush most of them off my legs, but my back was awful, because I could reach it very well. Anyway, that horrible experience ended, as do most unpleasant things. The pizza guy came and I immediately ate some, lugging the rest back to camp. Somehow, I ate too much and was uncomfortable for a few hours.

I heated up oatmeal water and made tea. While I ate, I went and took down the tent; for some reason, it was really muddy and wet underneath, the dirtiest I've put it away yet.     We chatted with the others at the campsite for a while and then left at about eight AM. For a couple of miles, the trail was steadily upwards, becoming rocky. Then, we headed down through some farmland where the swirling wind was stirring up the pollen in the grass. Sublimating dew was also passing from the grass into the air, making it feel even more humid.    We passed Pilgrim, a hiker from Northern India. We also passed Spice, a woman who slept in a hammock last night at our campsite. She is doing a flip flop, starting at Harper's Ferry and going North.

I thought of how happy Goldberry would be with a sub and chocolate milk for lunch instead of nuts and a cliff bar, so I agreed. Strangely, nobody else joined us. When I returned with fruit for all and subs and chips, Goldberry was lying on the seat of a picnic table, resting. She was happy to get lunch.    We got going again at three, still in the heat of the afternoon. I had begun to tackle a logistical problem; we were scheduled to arrive at our next post office drop on Sunday. This means that I would have to waste a day sitting around Boiling Springs, waiting for the post office to open. The heat and the rocks suggested another alternative--why not spend a day in Waynesboro, PA? In air conditioned comfort, laundering our slimy dirty clothes? This suggestion was accepted by Goldberry, so we hiked a few more miles, crossed the Mason-Dixon Line into Pennsylvania, and reached route 16.    At route 16, one of Goldberry's blog-readers had left us trail magic--sandwiches, beer, fruit, and cookies!

He shared news of Cheddar, Champa, and others. Unfortunately, the pool and snack bar were not open, but we used the rest room and the drinking fountain.    After the park, we hiked up 1000 feet and the clouds turned darker.

Goldberry went ahead, but stopped and waited for me at the second of FOUR ""halfway done"" markers (the first was in Harper's Ferry). The trail changes length each year as switchbacks and bridges are added and removed. The third halfway point was the fanciest, with the best sign. Soon afterwards, we passed the 1100 mile marker, except that there was no marker, just a post. Goldberry made a marker out of leaves. Finally, at about noon, we reached Pine Grove Furnace State Park. Many of our friends were there attempting the ""half-gallon"" challenge (one hour, ice cream). Although I had an icec cream cone, I did not attempt the half-gallon.    It had rained a bit and it was going to rain a lot more soon. Goldberry and I decided to stay in the campground, so we paid for a tentsite ($28!!!) and set up camp.     Then, we walked back to the camp store for dinner, but it began raining cats and dogs on the walk back and we were soaked. We had left our tent flaps open, so while we were gone we puddles accumulated in the tent and some clothes and bags got wet.

Of course, we hiked out at seven--after all, we are hikers; it's what we do.     After a half mile, it got really dark and thunder rumbled. Had I made a mistake not waiting? We were starting a rocky 15.6 mile day with a dousing? We hiked quickly along a flat dirt road, then turned up a Rocky creek bed and went uphill. The rain held off! Three hours later, we passed a shelter (7.5 miles into our day). Once more, it got dark and thunder rumbled. We consulted the satellite and it said that rain was imminent, but I chose to skip the shelter and stopped a mile later at a general store at route 34, 200 meters from the trail. Goldberry and I ate breakfast and she did sudoku while it rained for an hour. Then, the power went out and the store closed, so we went back to the trail. The sun was coming out!    We had about seven miles to go, with several climbs and ""rock mazes"". What is a rock maze? Turns out that some trail designer just wanted to have fun with boulders and white arrows and blazes. These sections were fun, but quite slow. By three, the thunder began again and it got darker by the minute. This time I was sure that we would be nailed by a serious storm. I began to hike faster and faster, leaving Goldberry behind to race the storm her own way. The rain began slowly and gained strength. Just when I crossed a river and saw the turnoff for the shelter, the thunder crashed and the rain started down in sheets. I ran through it for a minute or two, arriving with mostly dry shoes (my main concern).     ""Captain Clueless"" was already in the shelter. He was very nice, offering me butterscotch candies. He had just made a big fire, which had been immediately extinguished by the storm.    Soon, Goldberry arrived, soaked to the skin. She agreed to stay in the shelter, skipping the tent tonight.

The reason for this warning was that we covered a delightful twenty one miles yesterday, starting at 9:15 and arriving at 8:15.     It began the previous night, when ""Iceman"" commented on my view book that he would be willing to ""Slackpack"" us out of Duncannon. We met him briefly in April in NC. I called him and he agreed to meet us at the post office before work and then drive back to a road crossing 18 miles into our hike and drop off our packs for us! He also left a cooler with soda and water at Peter's mountain and loaned us day packs!    As we crossed the Susquehanna and climbed the thousand foot ridge out of town, the sky blackened and a moving curtain of rain and wind blasted down on us through the dense forest, blowing down small branches and leaves. The rain stopped after less than an hour, but returned several times over the next six hours on the ridge. Fortunately, we missed most of the heavy stuff for the rest of the day; it appeared that the rain preferred the river valley and the wind preferred the ridge. We hiked fast (for us) , meeting Kenya, Patriot, and some SOBOs. At 5:30, we met Iceman and his wife at the road, who took us for ice cream and sent us on our way.

It began last night, really, when I became concerned about (1) my left ankle, (2) the 17 miles with no shade or water, (3) the warnings about difficult rocks over 12 straight miles. I thought, ""why not try and slack pack tomorrow?""    Maybe I was influenced by my desire to slack pack yesterday, a desire thwarted by lack of shuttles, but today I decided that I really should arrange it.This morning, I got out the ultralight day pack that Goldberry gave me and packed it with three liters of water, a filter, food, headlamp, toilet paper, bug spray, extra socks, and a few other items. It seemed to feel ok. I called a cab at 6 AM (when they opened) and when I met the cab, he told me that he hadn't realized that it would be so far--he would have to charge me $50 to bring my backpack to the travel inn in the town of Wind Gap. I had my heart set on trying this, but it was much more than I wanted to spend. Just then, the ultralight backpack ripped a little in the back. I took it off, checked it out, and decided it would be ok. Just when I was leaving, it ripped all the way, becoming useless.     The cab waited. I made my decision--isn't my normal backpack ultra lite? I took out my pack liner and tent and sleeping bag, removing pretty much everything I wouldn't need that day (stove). I sent the cab with my gear, consolidated as well as I could, and headed up the very steep hill with my stripped backpack. This was a gamble, since I had to make it all the way to Wind River (20 miles) that day for my gear.    I actually had a potential bailout point five miles in, at Small Gap, if I had cell service. The ultra steep hike out of Lehigh Gap proved to be less challenging than all the warnings. It was like one of the steeper 0.6 mile sections of Monadnock. At the top, the trail leveled out, but thus far, the rocks weren't as bad as advertised. The ""superfund"" scenery was interesting--everything had died thirty years ago and the trees and shrubs were trying to grow back. There were some more blueberries at least.     Suddenly I remembered that I hadn't booked my room at the travel inn in Wind Gap yet, because I didn't know whether the cab would work out. I had called them several times this morning, but there was no answer. Would my stuff just be dropped off outside a locked office? I called the hotel, but still no answer. I rechecked the number and discovered some ""gut hook"" comments suggesting that the inn had closed!!! Eventually, as I hiked, I booked a room in the ""red carpet inn"" and had the taxi switch destinations.    My ankle was feeling good and I was making good time over the rocks, passing Snap, Nums, and two others. These were pretty much the only NOBOs that I would see all day.    I hiked for hours, checking off each landmark. I was okay the bailout point, so I continued. By two pm, I had only six miles to go, but my ankle was hurting again. Near the Leroy Smith Shelter, I suddenly struck a tall, sharp, rock with my left foot. Trying to avoid falling forward and striking my right knee on the rocks, I kicked out wildly with my foot. As soon as I came down,I knew that I had badly hyperextended my right knee. I lay on the ground, worried and hurting. I moved my pack so that it was cushioning my right leg from the rocks and stretched a bit. After five minutes, I limped over to the shelter, which was close.      As I hobbled through the rocks for the next few miles, my knee loosened up, so I kept going all the way to Wind Gap. I had made my twenty miles--but how injured was I? I thought it was possible that I'd be better in the morning. I was able to hitch to the Red Carpet Inn and order spaghetti from a local pizza place.

Not much.

One of them is the ridge walk south of Lehigh Gap (before Palmerton) with views, breezes, flowers, pine trees, and thousands of low blueberry bushes.

If I hurt too much, I will stop earlier and stay in the Pochuk Mountain Shelter. Anyway, Vernon is my next resupply and it has a nice church hostel. I may buy a knee brace in Vernon.    Many people are worried about my knee--I would be the worriest, but I'm into my third day of denial and I do not acknowledge or recognize that my knee is injured and that my hike is in jeopardy. I'm distracting myself by listening to ""Live Free or Die,"" a book by John Ringo about aliens taking over the world. I will eventually have to deal with ""reality"" but for now, I'm just moving forward one hour at a time.    Tonight I was pleasantly surprised by Elle, a very pretty young woman who has been following my trailjournals and gradually catching up. Also, Shoe arrived, post-wedding, with his quiet pleasant sense of humor.

It's not the birds or the sunrise, because it's been happening in dark rooms where neither apply. Anyway, regardless of when I go to sleep or how I sleep. So, I drank a double chocolate carnation instant breakfast and ate a cliff bar, stretching and hitting the trail by 5:50. At first, my knee was stiff and kept me to one mile per hour. It loosened up after a while--but Potchuk Mountain was a real test, heading straight upwards, rockily, at mile seven. Ascending has been so difficult and painful lately...but after a few minutes, one of my favorite Drop-Kick Murphys songs came on and I threw caution to the wind and tried to stride normally up the mountain. Joy and relief filled me as my right leg gradually threw off the rust and felt stronger with each minute. 
I was able to hike up the hill for six or seven minutes before my leg/knee felt tired and I thought I might be causing damage, so I slowed way down and tried not to limp for the next mile to the top. But if I felt OK for five minutes today, maybe longer tomorrow? Maybe I can recover in time to hike New York (lots of rocky uphills)!","Secret (Jim Murray) Shelter

I had only met Echo once (Delaware Water Gap) but I enthusiastically seized the opportunity. I thought that hiking without my pack for a day might help my knee heal.     Six of us piled into the truck and got rides back to the trail from the church in Vernon.Echo and Orion blew past me in five minutes, but I kept a steady pace on the uphill and kept ahead of Shoe, Elle, Quirks, and Simple Man (who had full packs). The ascent was called the ""Stairway to Heaven"" (credit to Led Zepplin) and was a very steep thousand feet reminiscent of ""the wall"" in Game of thrones, except not made of ice and adorned with trees.     My knee did not loosen up or feel ok on the ascent. However, a couple of miles later, I was able to descend for quite a few minutes on a rocky descent with no pain, a significant improvement. I have now had moments when I was able to ascend, walk on flat ground, and descend without pain--the problem is that my leg gets tired after a very short time and then begins to hurt. I finished the hike without real difficulty and then hitched back into Vernon to the church hostel.     I have my resupply box at the post office, which opens at 8:30 on Monday. After I go there and pack up, I will get a ride somehow to where I finished hiking today. I hope to find a trail angel, but if necessary, I will take a cab.

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539911,"Today I woke up in the church hostel. It felt really strange not to get going--what do people do from 5 AM until 8 AM? I couldn't hike because I had to get my resupply box from the post office at 8:30. Hong Kong Steve and I went to Dunkin' and had breakfast sandwiches and coffee. I helped clean up the foodstuffs that I had bought with Tortoise and Audubon, the German couple that was staying there for three days due to an eye injury. I hope that they get going and can finish. At this point, we are all rooting for each other to finish because we have so much invested in the hike. After my trip to the Post Office, I got a ride back the trail where I stopped yesterday (it cost $20). The trail was a little difficult at first, but after I passed the New York border and the first shelter, it became much more difficult. Up 500 feet, down 500 feet, very steep and rocky, all day. My knee was feeling much better due to some great therapy by Hong Kong Steve (see tomorrow's entry), but that meant that I went farther than I wanted to go. By five PM, I was tired and it was starting to rain. I had covered sixteen miles and I was slowing down.     I thought, ""it's only supposed to rain for one night and one day. Maybe I should stay in a motel!"". But the only two hotels near road crossings either were full or I just couldn't get a ride. And it began to rain in earnest. There was a big climb in front of me (""Black Mountain"" or something). I climbed. I ran into two people who were quitting the trail and waiting for rides. I became soaked, but I determined to hike 5 more miles to the next shelter, so I could maybe get a good night's sleep and not get my tent wetter than necessary.      My knee really began to hurt and I was so slow that I arrived at about 8 PM. Naturally, the shelter was full (it was pouring). Simple Man already had his tent up, as did Rabbit, Leopard, and Crash. Elle, Shoe, Quirks, Disco, and four others were in the shelter. I ate some food and set up my tent in the pouring rain--actually, I was glad to get practice at this. I did pretty well, and I was excited at how much room there was, even with my pack inside the tent. I spent the night sore from my 21 mile day, dirty from being muddy and sweaty all day, but dry enough and pretty comfortable. The next day, I hoped to climb Bear Mountain, get to the Hudson, and maybe go to a hotel to do my laundry (there's no Laundromat in Fort Montgomery or Bear Mountain). I was really worried that I had aggravated my knee, and I was already quite far ahead of Hong Kong Steve. Alone in the tent, I missed Goldberry.","Longhouse Drive

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540026,"Today on the top of Bear Mountain, I passed the 1400 mile mark. Since I have hiked a few miles since Bear Mountain, I have 790 miles to hike, through the hardest part of the trail.    So...my knee may have been improving slowly, and after several weeks of low miles, I may have improved enough to tackle some of New York. However, at the Vernon, NJ, church hostel, I ran into Hong Kong Steve again. He heard my story and asked if he could ""work"" on my knee. Even though Hong Kong Steve is NOT Japanese and doesn't specialize in Karate, he did a wonderful imitation of Mr. Miyagi from ""Karate Kid"". After twenty painful minutes of his poking massaging my knee and surrounding muscles, he isolated what he thought was the problem (""Oh--this is the same problem Sparky had, and I helped him also!""). When he was done, the surface tissue hurt like crazy but it was immediately clear that the knee was working much better. The next day, I hiked all day and then some. Unfortunately, Steve told me to ""go easy"" the next day, but it didn't work out, and I ended up hiking 21 miles (see previous day's entry). By the time I was done, I was sure of two things: (1) Hong Kong Steve was amazing at whatever he does and (2) I had overdone the day's hike and probably undone much of the magic. Hong Kong Steve was at least eight miles behind at the start of the day, so I didn't think that I'd see him for a while.    I began my day in my wet tent with a new dry set of clothes, except for my running shoes, which were still soaked. After packing up my wet tent and getting on the road, my new clothes were soaked completely in the morning's light rain. Also, the wet bushes and grass overlapped the trail and shed their rain drops on my socks, shoes, shorts, etc... There was no water at the shelter, so I took a detour with Trekeroni to Lake Toriati (or whatever it's called) and found a drinking fountain next to the lake beach and a rest room with flush toilets! (By the way, he's called Trekeroni because he has foot-long pepperonis duck-taped to his trekking poles, one on each.    After a few miles, I knew that today would be very difficult for me. As yesterday, it was so hot that even the light rain did not make me sweat less. I felt so stifled and gross, and everything was dripping. Yesterday's clothese were in my bag putrifying. I had to find a bucket and a clothesline or a laundry soon! Anyway it was too bad that I timed the rain so poorly--there would be really only one night and one day of rain, and I hiked for four hours in the rain, put up my tent in the rain, woke up in the rain, and hiked in the rain. If only I could have retreated to a shelter earlier in the evening, before the rain began!    My knee loosened up after about seven miles and I climbed past the Palisades Parkway and Bear Mountain. I leapfrogged a bit with Quirks and Simple Man, but I didn't see Elle and Shoe after morning. I thought that I could cover the fifteen miles by noon or one, because I started quite early, but my knees and legs were not cooperating. I climbed down Bear Mountain and reached the zoo a little before 4 PM.       I wanted a hotel with laundry. I called around and all the hotels were full except the more expensive one that was right on the trail, the ""Bear Mountain Inn"". Shoe and Elle had got the last room in the cheaper one. I checked in and tried to get my mail drop at the Bear Mountain Post office, but it was only open from 9-11 AM, so I will have to get it in the morning. Then, I tried to hike through the zoo, but it was closing. (yes, the AT passes through a zoo at Bear Mountain--free for thru-hikers). Tomorrow, I will have to get my box and hike the zoo and cross the Hudson river.   But where to dry all of my stuff? The inn has no laundry at all, and it's hanging round my room smelling everything up--there's no way it will be dry by morning.    I chatted with Simple Man and Quirks (a German hiker) about the next day. Simple Man said that there were two hikers in the pub, so I went to have some food ( I tried to order pizza but nobody delivers to the Inn). In the Pub, I found Hong Kong Steve and Moon Boots! (Moon Boots is a nice young man from New Hampshire who has been hiking with us off and on since Georgia. Hong Kong Steve said that he was worried about me because I didn't listen to him and take it easy today, so he found a spot and worked on my knee again! This time, I really will take it easy tomorrow. After all my worries, expense, and zero days, I shouldn't pass up this opportunity to let this Chinese ""Miyagi"" cure me!     By the way, New York is really quite difficult. It is much like New Hampshire, except that none of the climbs is more than 1000 feet--but there seems to be no flat at all--just up and down. Maybe further north, near the Conn border, it will get a little smoother.","Fingerboard Shelter

Also, I was really nervous about hiking a second day in a row after bonking so badly two days ago. I decided to hike to the first shelter and see how I felt.....but after three miles, I checked my phone and I saw a text from Iceman. Iceman helped Goldberry and me to slackpack near Duncannon. He follows hiker journals and seems to pop up when they need it most. The text message said that was willing to slackpack me that very day--and he was only five minutes away from me! I called him up and met him and his wife at the road. They took my pack and loaned me a day pack. At lunchtime, they took me to a deli and bought me lunch. I hiked 16 miles, struggling with my injured right leg, but finishing by 4 PM. Iceman met me at the Wiley shelter and we traded packs. This day could not have gone better, thanks to Iceman!    Well, actually it could have gone a little better--we were invaded by a 17-person summer camp group that took over the campsite.

If I hadn't been carrying a pack, I don't think I'd have limped at all, but since I was backpacking, I was forced to favor my leg. After five miles, I reached a roadside deli and bought coffee and a breakfast sandwich.     The breakfast stop turned out to be a helpful rest, and I was able to walk without limping for the next four miles, albeit slowly. I reached the Morgan Stewart Shelter at about noon. Naturally, I felt conflicted--I wanted to cover more miles, but I really liked walking without pain, so I stuck to my plan and stopped for the day.    It was a beautiful day, cool, sunny, breezy.

I knew that I would be hiking only ten miles today, trying to help my knee heal and grow stronger. It was terribly humid and stiflingly hot as I walked the first flat miles along the bank of the Housatonic River.     After three miles, I climbed Breadloaf Mountain and a couple of other 400-500 foot climbs. The trail was rocky and wet, but I was walking slowly due to my ankle and the heat, so the terrain didn't really effect my pace. At the first road, someone had left a bag of apples and bananas. Thanks! An hour later, I found a six-pack of cold Pepsi, so thanks again! (I drank one).    I reached Pine Swamp Shelter at two PM.

There were a few mosquitos, but not many, and they didn't make it far into the shelter. One man stopped by, ""Mando"", got water, and headed out. Rookie and Still Burning also passed through, chased by mosquitos. They were all headed to the next campsite (2.5 more miles) or the after-next (six more).      I ended up solo, the only person in the shelter.

Anyway, it was slimy and smelly and I couldn't use it. I decided to spray on a liberal coat of DEET, but after two sprays, I discovered that I was out! Thus began a long night of hot mosquitos. Actually, I added water to the empty bug spray, and I think that worked a bit.    Or at any rate, I was up at 4:45, packing up my stuff and getting out.

This time, I hiked south, heading up Mount Everett (2nd highest in MA after Greylock), Mount Race (beautiful cliffs, like Tinker cliffs but not quite as flat, and Bear Mountain (highest peak in CT). The trail was steep and rocky, but beautiful throughout (see the pictures). The day was very hot and humid and I had to be careful to stay hydrated.     As usual, I was concerned about my knee and my right hamstring, but as the miles passed, my knee loosened up, I stopped limping and was able to do the 17 miles in about eight hours. Perhaps I would have been faster, but hiking southward meant that I ran into many others, including Doc, Scooter, Rookie, and others, the conversation delaying my progress.     It was nice to see this area again. Many years ago, I taught economics in the Hotchkiss Summer Program, and I used to run on these trails during my free time.

She informed me that the driver, Onesimus, an athletically thin middle-aged man with a long white pony tail and duck-taped shoes, would be heading into Manchester soon, and I could have a ride. ""Trixie,"" the woman who invited me in, was hiking the AT in long sections. Onesimus had already hiked it more than once, so he is pretty much a full-time trail angel like Miss Janet.

I put out my sleeping stuff, filtered water, met the caretaker, and went for a swim. The water was cool and deep. Many thru hikers skip this shelter because it is one of the three $5 ""pay sites""; however, most don't realize that if you pay for one site, they give you a receipt that is good at the other two. So that's about $1.66 per night, a very reasonable fee, to stay at a great spot.

So I was actually hiking by five AM.    I passed Echo's tent at about six. The trail was really thick mud, roots, and puddles. After about four miles, I stepped right into a stealth mud puddle. It appeared just like regular dirt, but my shoe sank all the way up to the ankle in wet mud, instantly soaking my sock. I had worked so hard to keep my socks dry this morning, that I swore loudly in frustration. Then, I noticed that the bottom of my left pole had stuck in the mud and pulled off and broken off. And, I noticed that these two mishaps had occurred right next to a bemused ""rainbow family"" member, who was sitting on a large Walmart tarp next to the trail. He was the same long-haired man that had asked me for water the previous day because he had no filter. He was carrying a tiny dog with him. Anyway, the mosquitoes were becoming thick as dawn arrived and this man was frustrated by them. I asked if he had any mosquito repellent, and he showed me a bottle of eucalyptus oil. I told him that without DEET, it really wasn't mosquito repellent. He asked, ""Why would I want to spread poison on my body?"" Anyway, I mostly fixed my pole with duct tape that I carried, and I continued up the hill through a beautiful spruce forest near ""white rocks"". I kept moving steadily, hoping to get an early dinner at a roadside cafe called Q's Whistle Stop Cafe. The catch is that Q's closes at 3 PM and was fifteen miles into the day's hike.    I made it and had trail magic hitches both ways to the cafe. It was a family cafe and one of the waiters was an unbelievably cute ten year old blonde who did a super job. She even loaned me an iPhone charger and filled my water bottles!

I awoke planning to hike more miles today, but my knee feels as though someone packed it with cotton, reducing strength and mobility. I got a shuttle to EMS, where I bought new insoles and they fixed my broken pole. Actually, they mostly fixed it, but there is still a broken piece in there that will need to be removed at the next outfitter.    I also got my first haircut since Damascus. On the way back, I hiked the three-ish miles from route 4 to the Inn. Subman and Suds zeroed and will be heading out in the morning also.
I am planning to backpack fairly long tomorrow, but I will take my time and hopefully not injure myself further. I will know fairly soon in the day whether I will be able to make it to Winturri Shelter. I can't wait until I am close to Lebanon so that I can Slackpack and stay at the Cotters (Goldberry's parents). They offered to get me today, but I think it's still too far.
I wonder where Chopper and Mountain Goat are--they should be here soon. I think that I may be able to hike with them for a while this time.

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542407,"I got a late start for a good reason--the Inn at the Long Trail serves breakfast with the rooms, and it was a REAL breakfast, with blueberry pancakes and real maple syrup.     I passed ""Thundering Falls"" at about nine AM. It's a long waterfall next to a nice graded gravel path. On the other side of the falls, however, is a steady, steep, 1500-foot climb. My knee was hurting at the start, but I chatted with ""Junco"" on the way up about birds, and that distracted me from the pain. Junco taught me that one of the birds that I have been listening to is the ""Winter Wren"". This bird has a very beautiful call, full of trills and tweets. As a listmaker, I pronounce it fourth place for beautiful songs, behind the loons, the hermit thrush, and the owls (not sure which ones). I have been gradually learning more bird songs as the summer progresses, since that's what I listen to most of the day.     After climbing up and down for about four more hours, my knee was starting to hurt, but I was not ready to quit at the ""stony river shelter"". I decided to mosey on for another eight or ten miles, stopping at the ""lookout"" or at the Winturri Shelter. I ran into Subman and Suds repeatedly during the day, usually at stream crossings where they were getting water. Subman does not carry much water, preferring to filter several times a day. I like to carry two liters and drink until it's almost gone.     When I reached the ""lookout"" at six pm, I was quite tired, but I didn't want to stay there. The Winturri shelter was only 2.4 miles away, and it boasted a privy and a water source, so I continued. I was really glad that I went on--I was worried about injuring my knee, but the last two miles were mostly smooth and there was a late afternoon shadow and a cool breeze. I fought over the last hill and arrived at the shelter as darkness was falling. Johnny and Abby were there, and Orion, Bumblebee, and Golly. I hadn't seen Golly since before Damascus! Wishingbone, a Chinese hiker that I hadn't seen since Delaware Water Gap, also showed up late. I had my normal Knorr-Swiss noodles, with a salmon packet added and my last bagel with peanut butter and the last of my fritos. Usually, I resupply with mail drops and eat the food we prepared at home, but the last resupply was in Manchester after I lost my food bag, so I got strange things like raisins, bagels, peanut butter, salmon, fritos, and carrots. The carrots and fritos were delicious.     At about nine thirty, I reminded the others in the shelter that it was ""eight o'clock"" and they quieted down. I'm sure that those who were tenting next to the shelter were happy that the conversations stopped. If they hadn't quieted down, I was seriously thinking of waking at 4:30 and chatting to myself as I packed up!        One of our friends, Johnny, was hammocking near the the shelter. As he readied himself for sleep, I asked him if he were going to put up a tarp for the rain. He's a quiet lad, so he just pointed up at the dark blue evening sky, indicating that there were no clouds or rain forecast, so, no tarp. At nine PM, it began to rain, softly at first, and then harder. He struggled out of his sleeping bag and spent five minutes putting his tarp up, but exactly when he finished and climbed back into his hammock, the rain stopped for the rest of the night!    As I drifted off to sleep listening to ""Shantaram,"" a novel set in Mumbai, I noticed that my knee didn't hurt as much as it had during the day.

I slept in until 5:30, when Abby and Johnny were about ready to leave, then I packed up, ate a cliff bar and two Carnation ""instant breakfasts"" and hit the trail. My knee developed some sharp pains in the first downhill and continued to get worse for two miles. I called Paul and Carol and accepted their generous invitation to stay at their house. We arranged for them to pick me up later in the day. The Vermont views were better than usual--a nice view of Ascutney in the distance and some hilly farmland. There was a cool breeze and it was less humid. I passed route 12 at about ten AM. Also, THIRTEEN SOBOs. This must be the SOBO bubble. Seriously--there must be 20 NOBOs and 20 SOBOs passing today in this area. When the SOBOs get to the Long Trail, it will be crowded, especially because that's were the NOBO bubble will be. I reached Pomfret Road and hitchhiked south to a nice country store that sold coffee and egg muffins. Unfortunately, there was no cell service, so I couldn't call Paul, so I hitched to Woodstock, where I called Paul and ate an ice cream while I waited on the green at Woodstock Vermont. Paul showed up at noon and drove me to their nice farmhouse in Lebanon, where I will stay for the next three nights.

Goldberry drove me back to the trail at Pomfret Road and dropped me off to hike up a steep hill. Of course; after all, it's still Vermont!    Three of the hills today were active maple syrup farms, with webs of tubing heading from the trees downhill to larger tubes and eventually, to collecting sites. The first few miles were quite steep up and down, and my knee began to hurt immediately. I was only able to hike about one mile per hour until after noon, but later, my knee loosened up and I was able to keep up with a few hikers. I enjoyed hiking with Up and Kenmore, who gave me advice on how to treat my knee. I hiked with Baltimore, who hiked the perfect speed until he had to take a break. I spent at least two miles hiking with Rucker, a tall young woman whom I had met two hundred miles earlier. Finally, I completed the day hiking with Santiago, who began on January 1st and was planning to summit on the same day as me, September first. Santiago was named after the man from the Hemingway story.     I was unhappy for a while because my knee hurt; I really want to finish this hike at Katahdin, and it may not be possible. However, upon reflection, I decided that today was a really good day--my knee began to feel better, I almost made my ""distance quota"", I met some really nice people, and I was going to return to Paul and Carol's house tonight for a fine evening of barbecue and comfort. Legs and Verge called me from Vermont and they seemed happy. I had a very nice visit from my wife that morning. I decided that since TODAY was a really nice day, I shouldn't spoil it by worrying about tomorrow.   I hope that I remember this lesson for a while!","Pomfret Road

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542727,"I awoke with high hopes for today which were dashed when I walked down the stairs to the kitchen and my right knee felt sharp pains. After coffee and cheerios, Paul drove me back to West Hartford and I hiked for a while on a road, crossing over route 89 and into the woods. The terrain was hilly, but not as hilly as previous Vermont days. I reached Norwich at noon and walked through the middle of town down the hill towards the Connecticut River. I passed rte 91; only ONE more interstate highway left (route 93) near Lincoln.       My knee loosened up after five miles, but still hurt more than usual. I tried really hard to control my body and not limp or favor my left leg. I passed Baltimore again, chatting with him about literature and flowers. He really is a graceful person. I enjoy people who are polite, kind, and sensitive to those around them. Baltimore has a quiet peacefulness that is immediately evident upon speaking with him.     I was filled with gratitude and excitement as I walked across the bridge to Hanover. I've been hobbling on a hurt knee for hundreds of miles, worried on a daily basis that any day might be my last, and the realization that I made it to New Hampshire was more powerful than I expected. This surge of emotion reinforced my determination to finish the trail. Although reaching Katahdin would have no useful purpose, its value to me would be immense and rewarding.     Despite only hiking ten miles, my legs were exhausted. I believe this is the result of using certain muscles more than normal to compensate for the injured knee. I'm considering doing a zero day soon if I don't improve. These few days of ""slackpacking"" are supposed to heal my knee enough that I have a fighting chance of finishing the White Mountains. At the current rate, I will have a very tough time hiking the Whites with my backpack (or even without).     I met ""the hat lady"" today as I exited Lou's bakery with my free ""hiker donut"". We chatted for a while and I thanked her for taking such good care of hikers--thanks to Paul and Carol, I do not currently need any ""trail magic"" (except the donut!), but I appreciate trail angels like the hat lady. I hope that Legs and verge get an opportunity to meet her also (there's a picture in my photo gallery).     Some of my trail family is thinking of quitting the trail, even though they have made it almost to Vermont. I read in their blogs that they are homesick and tired of the routine of hiking every day. If they read this blog, they should hear two things:     First, only people with a strong desire to reach Katahdin finish the trail. Unless you keep it in your mind as THE priority, you will always find some excuses to quit and do some other fun or interesting adventure. I remember speaking with Bumpy and with Bugs before they left the trail. They didn't admit it, but they had already decided to quit before they even knew it. They said that they were ""thinking about stopping"" or ""thinking about going home"", but they really had already decided to stop. If you haven't decided to keep going, you've decided to stop.     Second, if my friends happen to be from, say, Texas, and they haven't seen the Whites yet or the green jewel of a state that is Maine, they have to keep going because they will end up going back to wherever they live, say for example Texas, and never experiencing these things. Trust me, the echoing call of the loons on the evening lake under a million stars at Antler Campsite in Maine is worth the extra 300 miles of walking!     I am writing this after hiker midnite at the Cotter farmhouse.

Most of the day was gently up and down or hopping on rocks across swampy woodland. There were quite a few blowdowns cluttering up the trail from recent high winds.     The views on the AT incompletely reflect the physical experience of the trail. Lately, I have been noticing the recurring smells, such as lush ferns, hemlock or pine needle forests, mud, rain, and animals. Walking down the trail sometimes I catch a strong smell of fox or bear. Forest smells, campfire smells, tent smells--these will aid my memory in recalling this trip in years to come.       Today, I ran into new hikers and familiar ones. I met Subman and Suds again, who were doing pretty long miles and they were concerned about my knee. I met Golly, Retainer, Popper, Badger, Abby and Johnny, and Magic Man. It was particularly nice to see Magic Man with his new beard. I didn't think that I would see him again because he hikes so quickly. He is majoring in Aerospace Engineering at Case Western, but still has time to do the trail. He also writes cute poems in the shelter registers about his experiences.       I have a plan now; with the help of the Cotters, I am slack-packing from Hanover to Moosilauke.

Paul drove me to Glencliff and I headed up Moosilauke. The White Mountains at last!     I was determined to walk steadily and smoothly up the 3300 foot climb, and I managed the first half of the climb very well. I ran into Santiago at that point and chatted with him about Moosilauke and the Whites in general. Actually, I pretty much did all the talking, since he is from Tennessee. He is named after the ""old man"" in ""The Old Man and the Sea."" Before I knew it, we were over the south peak and on the ridge. I discovered a lethargic moose a few meters off the trail sitting on the ground. Assuming that he was welcoming me to Moosilauke, I walked over and chatted with him, snapping a few pictures and saying hi. Eventually, he rose to his feet on long spindly legs; he didn't look very healthy, so I decided that visiting hours were over and I walked back to the trail. The summit was all fog and clouds, but I love Moosilauke, so I was very content with the low evergreen shrubs and the different colors of alpine grasses. I asked a French (no--not Canadian) boy to take my picture at the sign.     I had never been down the ""Beaver Brook Trail,"" but I had seen pictures of the dastardly descent. The descent was twice as long as the ascent, so the descent is a milder pitch, right? Nope--the descent had a nasty proclivity to keep going up when it was supposed to go down, so in the end, it was longer AND steeper than the ascent. More to the point, the whole last two miles of descent were in or next to a series of waterfalls. Fortunataly, someone had built wooden steps and attached them to the slippery rocks, but the steps were slippery also, so it was still incredibly dangerous. Don't bring children on this trail, folks!
I walked down with ""Not a Bear"" and we easily yogi-ed a ride to the ""notch"" hostel. I had brought my pack here yesterday and today it was waiting in the ""AT shack"" hanging on a peg.

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543429,"Today was a Yoda day. Yoda says, ""Do or do not--there is no try."" Today my knee and I slackpacked 16 miles up a couple serious climbs and a nasty descent. As always when slackpacking, we had no sleeping bag, tent, or extra food, so if I became injured and couldn't go further....there's no solution--stranded. So, today I wasn't going to ""try"" to hike to Franconia Notch--I had to DO (or not). Yoda day.    Six of us got a ride to the trailhead at Kinsman Notch, with Squid volunteering to ride in the bed of the pickup. He got cold. I headed up first, but after 45 minutes, everyone had passed me except Junco, who had his pack and was going to be even slower. By the top of Mount Wolfe, my knee was tired and my legs hurt (2000 foot rock scramble). However the descent from Mount Wolfe was really rocky and slippery, with deep mud and standing water all over the trail from last night's storm.     We passed over a bog, walking on some ancient wooden boardwalks. It is important to know the difference between a bog and a swamp. A bog has a special kind of moss that grows on the surface and gets gradually thicker until it fills the pond from the top down. This means that when you use your poles to balance yourself on the ancient rotting logs, sometimes the poles are entirely supported by this floating vegetation. However, you may come to places where the poles sink down.....ALL THE WAY down to your hands...and if you're not careful, you can overbalance and fall into the bog, which can be VERY DEEP. This had clearly happened to a few people recently, looking at the vegetation.     After Mount Wolfe, I walked past Eliza Brook and began to head up past a series of waterfalls as I ascended South Kinsman. The waterfalls were beautiful splashy white foamy things that all seemed to have their own appropriately-sized swimming holes. I took pictures and videos for Goldberry, who loves the streams, especially chattery ones.      A note about cool. In the ""real world"" there are many icons of coolness (Mother Theresa, Elvis, Michael Jordan, Steve Jobs, etc...). There are also collective ""groups"" that are cool (rock stars, neurosurgeons, billionaires, movie stars). On the trail, it's a bit different. First, there are trail celebrities, such as Bob Peoples and Miss Janet. Then, there are the superhuman hikers, such as Endless and Future Dad. Of course, there are some (Jennifer Pharr Davis and Scott Jurek) who are in both categories. But celebrities are so rare that we really don't have to think about them, so the rest of the people on the trail, I figure, are day hikers, weekenders, section hikers, lashers, and thru-hikers; in general the thru-hikers are the coolest. But recently, a group has been out-cooling us (the thru-hikers). Today, as I trudged through the nasty mud and scaled the near-vertical rock scrambles, two young men and a young woman ran past. They didn't trudge, walk, or climb--they were ""out for a run""--a quick eighteen mile trail run over two 4000 footers and three 3000 footers. When they got to Eliza Brook, which was engorged with recent rain, they did not try to pick their way across on the top of rocks, but instead just ran through the two-foot deep water, getting their socks and running shoes wet. They didn't have rain gear or apparently food, just thin hi-tech camelbacks. They were shouting and singing and having fun as they dashed up the mountain and immediately, obviously, became the coolest people on the trail. Who can RUN up that crazy trail?    Yeah, they were cool, and I love the surging popularity of this sport, but actually they aren't as cool as the 70 year-and-over thru-hiker category. These men and women are awesome, and any twenty-somethings that just graduated from college or forty-somethings that just quit their jobs should hike with them and listen a bit. You can learn a lot from these people!       I finally reached the summit of South Kinsman, a really steep climb. My knee was hurting and locking up and I was really worried about the descent. While climbing down along the ridge towards North Kinsman, I encountered a large group of non-muddy, non-sweaty hikers with day packs. This raised my mood, because it showed me that the other side of Kinsman couldn't possibly be as challenging as the south side. I passed Kinsman Pond and then, three miles later, reached Lonesome Lake Hut, where I discovered Squid and Tumbleweed eating soup. Love those huts!    In the hut, I changed my socks and filled up my water bottles. The hut system provides a welcome rest, potable water, and rest rooms. Sometimes, you can even buy soup. Hiking down from the lake, I encountered a young couple who were out ""practice hiking"" for next year's thru-hike. They asked me questions, I went into my ""teacher mode"" and taught them as much as possible, and that kept me from noticing my hurting legs and knee until I reached route 93. Then, they gave me a ride in the back of their pickup truck the eight miles back to the hostel.     A nice man at the hostel drove ""lost and found"" and me to the grocery store, where I bought ingredients to cook blueberry pancakes for everyone tomorrow morning. I must take a ""zero day"" tomorrow in order to ensure that I have the maximum possible chance of hiking the five (at least) days WITH my backpack from Liberty Springs to Pinkham Notch.

The communal rooms have leather sofas and plenty of chairs and tables. Also, there's lots of free food, including pancake mix and syrup. The owners, Justin and Sereyna, just started the hostel last year and they have at least two employees working on social media, guest check-in, and cleaning.

Then, I walked to the movies and saw the new Star Trek movie (excellent). Lincoln was full of thru-hikers!    A fun game is to sit at a coffee shop on the street, a restaurant, or the grocery store and try to determine who is a thru-hiker and whether they are NOBO or SOBO. The most telling details are beards and crocs, but there are many other clues. I suppose this is one of the channels on ""hiker tv.""   When I returned to the hostel, I aired out my tent and my sleeping bag and packed for tomorrow. I should be able to make a quick exit. The hostel drives to Franconia Notch at 7:45, but a nice man named Van who is staying at the hostel offered to drive me at 5:30. He is getting in shape this summer by doing the ""New England 57,"" the four thousand foot mountains in New England.     Tomorrow is the ultimate test of my knee--up to the Franconia Ridge, over Lafayette, down the Garfield Ridge, up Garfield Mountain, and down to the campsite.

If I average 11 miles per day and they average 18 miles per day, they will catch up in ten days--only three days into Maine.   I want to hike with them, but they are faster than my knee will allow, so maybe I can hold them off for a couple more weeks and summit with them, rather than having them pass me sooner and leave me in the dust.","The Notch Hostel

Hiked all day and my knees hurt more each hour, first my right knee, then my left. As I passed Mitzpah, rain approached. I enjoyed brief views towards the Mount Washington Hotel from the ridge before the rain actually began. I was able to duck into the Lake of the Clouds Hut for the rain, pretty much missing it completely.     I was limping seriously when I finally reached the summit. Of course, there were hundreds of people all over, eating at the summit house and waiting for the train.    Looking at the four-thousand foot descent, I bought a ticket and rode down the mountain on the shuttle, staying at Pinkham Notch and resting my knee for the remainder of the day.     Naturally, I have been seesawing between despair and elation, not knowing whether I will reach Maine or even be able to hike the next day. Just putting one foot in front of the other. In the evenings, I listen to audiobooks to calm my thoughts. I'm worried enough that I really cannot relax unless I'm listening to a book. I'm listening to ""Shantaram,"" an incredible novel about an Australian expat who lives in Bombay.","Crawford Notch

After the first peak, the trail just bumped up and down for about five miles, culminating with a very steep descent down from North Carter Mountain to the Imp campsite. I arrived at the Imp campsite at about noon, settling down and eating one of my dinners for lunch.    About two PM, several young SOBOs arrived and occupied the top floor of the shelter. I napped for two hours and then made dinner. A summer camp arrived and chatted with me as they prepared dinner. I was asleep again by eight PM, listening to ""Shantaram"" until I fell asleep. By the way, ""Shantaram"" is an extraordinary novel, philosophical and colorful. When I finally finished reading it, I didn't want to start another book because the beauty and power of the story stayed in my mind like the aftertaste of a delicious meal.     I am hoping that my shorter days will help my knee to heal, but thus far, I think the balance is slowly tipping towards more injury and damage.

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544285,"I am writing this from the White Mountains Hostel, in Gorham, NH; it's another contender in the ""most organized hostel"" and ""best hostel for your money"" category.   When I hobbled in from the trail, they shooshed me into a garage stall with shelves of loaner clothes and asked me to put all of my dirty laundry, including from my body, in a tub, dressing myself in loaner clothes (Tommy Bahama). Then, inside to register, get a bunk, and find a shower. thiry minutes later, I was shuttled down the road to get lunch and go to an outfitter for a new gas canister. The ""Wal-Mart"" grocery trip is tonight at six pm. Returning from my shuttle to town after two hours, I took a nap. Waking up, I found all of my laundry, which had been cleaned as I napped. The only thing that I still have to do is finish my food resupply, buy two new water bottles (they are moldy again) and blog.     Now that I have reported on the present, I will speak of this morning. I awoke at 4:45 after a solid night's sleep. The dawn was lighting up the east, and as a I packed my stuff, the dawn turned colorful (red sky in morning....), and I headed out up the trail at 5:30 exactly after a breakfast of 1 cliff bar. I decided to drink some Carnation Instant Breakfast at the top of Moriah.     Climbing Moriah from the south was a steady fifteen hundred feet, highlit by ledges and nice views. As I climbed, the rain approached from all directions, but suddenly I saw a golden spot in the distance. A hole in the clouds had opened up right above the top of Mount Washington and the golden sunlight was lighting only the summit. Each building was visible, but the ridge downwards was shaded by rain clouds.     The summit of Moriah continued for forty minutes, with views in every direction. I eagerly looked northeast, looking towards Katahdin, but I knew that visibility would be only a fraction of that distance. The mountains were all blue with valleys full of cloudy undercast. Moriah is instantly one of my favorite mountains in the east.     The hike down from Moriah was a downwards exponential curve, flattening out as I passed the rattle river into two of the flattest miles on the trail--not THE flattest two miles--that would be anywhere in the Cumberland Valley. When I reached route 2, a car pulled over and a man rolled down the window. ""Are you Bombadil?"" the man asked. He lives on my brother Ian's neighborhood in Utah and recognized me from Ian's facebook posts or from my blog. It was nice to meet another enthusiastic friend.     As I ended my hike today, my left knee (the ""good one"") hurt consistently for the last mile. I hope that the pain was caused by the 3200 foot drop, not from the mere eight miles hiked, because I'm supposed to hike twelve miles tomorrow through several more challenging climbs.     One final note from today: I passed a ""300 miles to go"" sign made from sticks near the Rattle River Shelter. So that means I have only 298 miles to go to the end, but first I have to get to Maine.","Imp Campsite

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544723,"I skipped the nice breakfast at the White Mountains Hostel and headed out by 5:30 AM. I was hiking up Mount Hayes with a 79-year old long distance section hiker who is one section from finishing! He was surprised that I didn't want to pass him, but my knee was killing me and I was hiking about one mile per hour for the first three hours. After I passed the summit of Mount Hayes, my knee loosened up a bit and I was able to go faster. The next few summits and ledges were not steep and I enjoyed the hiking. I passed several ponds before reaching Gentian Pond around three PM. Twelve miles of hiking in almost ten hours. Even though I didn't end up going far, because I was hiking for so many hours, I was hungry and tired.     Gentian Pond is a glacial pond enlarged by a busy beaver. The shelter is high on a ledge above the pond with a superb view to the southeast. Not long after I arrived, another NOBO hiker, a long distance flip-flopper named Hornet who had recently retired arrived. We both chose to stay on the ""second floor"" of the shelter. Then, a loud group of five SOBOs arrived. Actually, they weren't as loud as some other recent SOBO groups, and they seem much more prepared for their trip. Four of them stayed down below and the lone girl in their group chose to sleep upstairs between the old guys.     I had brought fritos from Gorham for their flavor, calories, and salt. One bag of fritos usually lasts me three days, but I sat in the shelter and ate this bag until it was gone, nibbling as I spread out my stuff and got my ""bedroom"" ready. When I was finally ready, I had finished the whole bag and my thirst gave me energy to go down and filter water for dinner and drinking. Although the water source was a beaver pond, and was warmed by the sun, it wasn't scummy or full of sediment and wasn't so far away.     I slept pretty well that night, waking up in the middle of the night once or twice and being amazed by the huge spread of stars above me. Each of the last few nights have had amazing stars.","White Mountain Hostel, Gorham
",Gentian Pond Shelter,"Aug 02, Tue",12
Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544732,"I slept in a bit--the SOBO group was up at 4:30 and gone by 5:00--and they were even quiet! I liked them. I watched Hornet leave as I was eating my oatmeal at about 6:30. The oatmeal lately has dehydrated raspberries and strawberries in it, making it delicious! I also have been making a cup of mocha with my oatmeal, to get my caffeine and to clean out my cup.     The first mountain was Mount Success, which was similar to Mount Moriah, but smaller. Every mountain has beautiful views of the presidential ridge, and each time I see this view, I assume that it will be the last, but it isn't. I hiked these same mountains when I was fourteen, during my summers at Camp Chewonki, so these few days are a trip WAY down memory lane. Oddly, the mountains seem about the same size now, but the woods seem prettier. The views of the hills in Southern Maine are more blue than they were in New Hampshire, recalling the horizon in the Blue Ridge Mountains. There aren't many other similarities, however, because these mountains are rocky, steep, and covered with short spruce trees and moss.     I have spent many of the last few days flipping through my past. I remembered college friends and my college experience as I hiked from Hanover to Moosilauke. I remembered hiking when I was only a child on Lafayette, Cannon, and Washington. I thought of my mother, who loved the alpine flowers and grasses, and I took some pictures of them for her. My aunt Ellen spent a great part of her life in the White Mountains, and her attitude towards smaller mountains and the details of the forest helped me to love them better. Now, she lives in Maine, and I am hiking closer to her home. This casual recalling and sorting of memories results in a clearer picture of who I am now and where I am going. Sometimes, more questions arise, but occasionally I find a few answers.     When I passed Carlo Col, the other side was a crazy drop. In the southern AT, there are these things called ""switchbacks,"" where the trail goes back and forth, saving you the pain of steep downhills and saving the trail from erosion. Coming north, the hillsides are too steep and rocky, so there are no more switchbacks, and the southerners complain. In Maine, a new phenomenon appears--they have forgotten to connect the peaks with ridges. I passed over Carlo and saw that I was only a quarter mile from heading up the next mountain, but they put the mountains a bit too far apart, so I had to climb down a 400-foot cliff and back up another one just to cover the quarter mile between mountains. In Virginia or New Jersey, these mountains would have been helpfully connected by a ""ridge.""     Each of the ""Gooseye"" mountains was also unconnected, and obviously, we had to scale the absolute peak of each one. And, to make it more interesting, they continue to put ladders and rebar climbing walls on the nifty cliffs. Each of the Gooseyes also had a beautiful view of Washington and the presidentials, as well as nice views forward of Old Speck and the Baldpates.     I reached the shelter at about four PM, with equal, but different pains in each knee. Every day, my body has to toss a coin to decide on which side to limp, depending on the kind of pain in each knee.     Sharing the shelter at Full Goose with me were two SOBOS, Bandaid (a 20-ish woman struggling to keep up with her friends, most of whom went on to the next shelter) and Sexy Jesus, who flipped up to Katahdin from Hot Springs because it was too hot in Tennessee. Sexy Jesus had sandy blond beard, long hair, and tatoos all over his body. He also rolled and smoked at least a dozen cigarettes while hanging out at the shelter, but it is a very long low shelter, so the smell did not annoy me.     There was also a group of five (tenting) Lebanon High kids, two of whom had my mother-in-law as an elementary school teacher, and about twelve girls from summer camp. While we were there, the roving caretaker was stirring the compost from the privy and then doing something to the many rows of drying racks that sounded like a five-hour-long drum circle. Thump, thump. This drumming didn't bother me--each detail added a little texture to the camp environment.     I wondered how I would survive the next day, with my knees trashed and the ""toughest mile on the AT"" ahead of me.","Gentian Pond Shelter

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544735,"I awoke a bit late and sluggishly prepared for my day as Sexy Jesus and Band-Aid left. Alex Magay and his brother Chris were going to meet me at the southern end of Mahoosuc Notch, but I figured it would take them until at least 10 AM. Yesterday, they hiked up to Speck Pond and camped. This morning, they were going to hike down the arm and through the notch, meeting me and carrying my pack back through the notch and back up Mahoosuc Arm. I hiked up the small mountain and down to the notch, arriving at about ten AM. Alex and Chris had just arrived and were sitting down eating a snack. They didn't look tired--they must have done well through the notch, because it is notoriously difficult.     Slackpacking the notch wasn't very hard. A few times, the required steps hurt my knee, but overall, it wasn't very taxing. However, it was beautiful, with cliffs and even some snow (see the pictures). How could there be snow in August in Maine? It had accumulated all winter, filling up the cracks and crannies of the notch and was protected from melting by the depth and the shadows of the granite slabs. Many times, going through the notch, we had to go UNDER the boulders into dark tunnels because the cliffs atop were too technical.     On the other side of the notch, we hiked up Mahoosuc Arm, a steep 2300 foot ascent onto a ridge overlooking Speck Pond. As I crested the top of the ridge, my right knee completely collapsed, losing strength and making me cringe with shooting pain. Resting heavily on my poles, it took me an hour to hike down a half mile to the pond. I was elated to finally collapse into the shelter after hiking only a five mile day.     Alex and Chris had hiked up a surprising and delicious meal. They brought red wine, beer, two chunks of Smith's Country Cheese, pre-cooked rice, saag paneer, and two kinds of curried lentils. We spent the next four hours swimming in Speck Pond, filtering water, resting, heating up the food, and eating. We enjoyed chatting with Brendan the caretaker and another hiker who had been flyfishing (successfully).     Although it was a great day, with good food, company, slack-packing, and swimming, I knew that my knee was very close to ending my hike. However, by the end of the day, I had a plan to continue, so I simply put my faith in sleep's healing powers and positive thinking as I listened to my book and went to sleep.     Incidentally, I have been reading ""Inspector Gamache"" books by Louise Penny. They are Agatha Christie-style books set near Montreal. I started reading them for some light entertainment, but her writing style is very witty and insightful, a cross between James Herriot's detailed style and PG Wodehouse's witty dialogue. Perfect reading to drown out snoring people in shelters!","Full Goose Shelter

I left before everything was cleaned up and got a headstart, leaving a beautiful Speck Pond behind. We hiked up onto the ridge and then down to the road, a steep downhill where they caught up to me and their car was waiting. My knee was shot, so today was a short day--Chris Magay drove me to Andover, to the Pine Ellis Hiker Hostel, where Alex bought me lunch at the ""Red Hen"". What a super help!    I am amazed that each time I am teetering on the edge between quitting and carrying on, some kind person gives me exactly the help that I need to continue. Perhaps this is one reason I want to keep moving until I am physically incapable of walking farther; I already know not to make ""the decision"" at night--nature's healing has performed remarkable miracles overnight several times, enough to push me back from the edge. Thus far, my ""angels"" have been The Church of the Mountain Hostel in Delaware Water Gap, Iceman, Pat Cotter (and Shauna), Paul & Carol Cotter, Alex (and Chris) Magay, and of course my wife Goldberry, who has allowed me to spend unexpected amounts of money to slackpack and get the rest I need.

I stopped twice, considering the idea of turning around and either stopping for good or taking a zero. But I decided that I wasn't going to quit until I really couldn't continue ... maybe my knee would feel better after the uphill.     Goldberry says that if I'm not having fun, I should stop. It has been so many days since I enjoyed hiking--mostly because of the incessant pain and the ultra-slow pace. For a couple weeks, I have been averaging about one mile per hour--so a ten-mile day takes me from six AM until four PM. But I remember those days in Virginia when I couldn't get the smile off my face all day, and I want to return to that feeling! I'm such a ridiculous optimist that I still think that my knee might just heal over time if I'm careful and I slack-pack. If I can just finish the southern Maine steepies.     So, I kept hiking, needing inspiration. I passed Junco and New Hampshire Bob. On the way down from Old Blue towards Bemis, suddenly I saw a trail runner headed up the mountain. Immediately, I recognized him from last year when I was waiting for Scott Jurek at Upper Goose Pond Road. It was Karl Meltzer, ""the Speed-Goat"" working on day five of his SOBO supported AT record. Actually, Jenny and Scott Jurek are among his support crew. Anyway, he was enthusiastic about taking a selfie with me and I wished him luck. Go Speed Goat!!    That chance meeting inspired me. I thought about the challenge ahead of Karl and the passion and enthusiasm accompanying that record attempt, and it helped me hike with more enthusiasm myself. Bemis Mountain was beautiful and there was a nice breeze blowing for hours.     As I came down Bemis, or rather ""the Bemises"" because there were about five peaks, rain stormed by a couple of times, missing me. I filled up on ripe fresh blueberries; the berries on this section are the most abundant on the trail thus far. Even though I got hit by the rain eventually on the steep down-and-up, I was feeling decidedly better by the time I reached route 17.

I took a slightly wrong trail and ended up hiking an extra mile along a logging road to get back to the AT, but I was feeling pretty good for a while, averaging about two miles per hour up to Saddleback Junior. As always, I was planning and dreaming about how I've finally ""turned a corner"" and headed for Stratton, the Bigelows, Monson, and Katahdin!    I went over Saddleback Junior and dipped down a few hundred feet before heading up the steep ""horn"" of the saddle. Cresting the horn and seeing one of the best views in Maine, my heart swelled. Maine is beautiful, green and blue, ridges and lakes. Then, with no warning, my right knee totally gave out. Shooting pain and weakness forced me to just sit down. Still optimistic, but concerned, I worried that sitting and resting would throw off my timetable for the day. When I carefully rose and began hiking at my unfortunate 0.8 mile per hour pace, things went all right for fifteen minutes before it happened again. Once more, I took off my pack, sat, and rested. This time, my knee didn't get better--when I was able to start, the pain and weakness came back after only five minutes. I was one mile from the summit of Saddleback and then after that, five miles from the road.     I took two hours to hobble up Saddleback and then decided to take a side trail down the ski area, two miles to the bottom of the lift, where I could hitch a ride. I alternated between walking backwards and hobbling. The long grass and flowers on the trails was beautiful.     I reached the bottom at 3:30 and began to walk along the road. Soon, I was able to hitch a ride t the IGA parking lot in the next town, where I could grab some groceries and hitch another ride to the ""farmhouse"" hostel. For what seemed like the fiftieth time, I thought my hike was finally over.     At the hostel, the shuttle from the trail intersection at route 4 drove up and guess who hopped out of the car? Legs and Verge, to provide me exactly the cheering up that I needed. We ate veggies and sang songs and had a very nice evening. Juan Durer and Training Wheels and Farmer showed up also. Juan played Izz songs on his Banjokelele. By the end of the day, I had decided to go to Stratton and then try to hike from there. Maybe one more zero day would cure me enough to get to Monson. After all, if I absolutely needed, I could skip the 100-mile wilderness and just climb the big K again, because Goldberry and I did that section last August, with Katahdin.     So I went to sleep not knowing about the future, but content to let it unravel as it will.","Route 4, the Farmhouse

At least eight times, I thought I was done, but after a night or a ""zero day"", I was able to continue. Finally, midway through Maine, my knee stopped functioning well enough for me to hike further.

Bombadil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550844,"So, I'm back teaching high school math. I sit in a chair correcting papers and writing grade reports late into the night by the electric lights. I am always tired. Since I've been ""back"", crowds bother me, and every day I have a school meeting with 300 people. Everyone is moving and talking at a million miles per hour and I am confused and sometimes frustrated. I dream of just going back and walking every day, of sleeping when the sun goes down (or earlier!) and waking with the dawn's light and the birds singing.    I miss the kindness and honesty of the people I met on the trail. Either thru-hikers just are great people or they act like great people when they are on the trail. Except for me. The trail was trying hard to ""change me"" into a better person, and I'm sure I resisted to my core. Except that the trail magic is still acting upon me, teaching me and trying to turn me kinder, happier, healthier.    I have gone to a series of doctors about my knee and had an MRI. I have a small ""granular"" tear in the meniscus of my right knee. I also beat the hell out of both knees limping and hiking through the injury. My injury, which happened in Pennsylvania, was a traumatic one resulting from tripping over a rock and flinging my foot out to balance myself. It was not the normal result of overuse. One of my thoughtful readers was worried that the trail ruins everyone's knees. In a sense, the trail IS hard on everyone's knees, especially those people who have a deadline or who push themselves to do long miles. However the bruising and battering of normal knees heals quickly along with the giardia, crazy muscle loss (men) and other weird symptoms of trail-itis. I know many hikers whose knees are fine now, and I am sure that mine would be had I not hiked on through the pain for so many weeks.    Because I have been slowly improving--enough to climb Monadnock several times in three weeks, I have decided to forgo surgery at this time. I will allow my knee to keep healing and add weights and stationary biking. Maybe the cross-country ski season will also help me to recover my strength. I am still a bit worried that the basic injury will only heal to a certain point, leaving me still unable to hike the PCT or other long trails, but if that happens, I will find out this spring     I have postponed my goal of hiking across part of Siberia and Lake Baikal next summer because I need to heal and raise funds. Goldberry is not interested in Siberia, so she will not be coming on that trip and I don't want to be away for her so long just yet. To be honest, my thirst for adventure waned a bit during July and August, although I still have an ardent desire to walk every day and live out of a backpack in the woods and mountains.    Despite missing the eighty miles between Stratton (Maine) and Monson, I still consider myself a thru-hiker, not that this label is important. I actually want to be a ""thru-hiker"" because so many of my friends are in this group and I shared this experience with them. Next June, a day or so after graduating from high school for the thirtieth time, I will set out from Stratton to hike north. I plan to hike to Katahdin and then turn around and then hike back to my car at Stratton. Possibly, I will just keep going to Vermont...who knows? Maybe Magic Man, who apparently stopped at the exact spot as I did this year, will join me for the end of the trail. I suppose it may be crowded at that time--the early Southies will be bubbling through. It will also be buggy--June in Maine! But it's where I want to be, so I hope to meet some of you out there sometime.     People ask whether I'm interested in hiking the PCT or the CDT some day, expecting that perhaps it's all out of my system or something. I certainly want to hike these trails as soon as I am healthy enough and my job allows. But oddly, I wouldn't mind hiking the AT again also. I now sympathize with my friend Giuseppe, who hiked back and forth along the AT four times in two years. He just wanted to be walking on the AT.
