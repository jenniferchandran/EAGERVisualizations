MAGYAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522043,"In 4 days I get into a rental car in Burlington VT and driving down to Georgia. As immediately exciting as this truth is I keep myself at bay by trying to enjoy the comforts of civilization. I have all sorts of theories. I remember from my first attempt at a thru hike that from weather, to mileage, the conversation eventually turns to calories. Food takes on great interest to a thru hiker and I am trying to savor the ease of access I have in these last days of anything I want. Then there is a bed. Ah what a thing a mattress and down comforter affords the slobs of humanity. Somehow though, I am finding myself fantasizing more about jet boiling my dehydrated food at camp after setting up my overpriced tent. Katelyn, my love, is putting up with my absent mindedness. I have about three quarters of my mental energy on the AT. I try to remind myself that it will come all too soon and that it will be total immersion.Logistics. I have seen posts and journals that give good ideas/advice for hikers. Advantages to the many who have spent days/months/years of their lives enjoying this activity. Hikers are as varied as people. I am a mental health counselor in Vermont who needs his own therapy this time.I will skip the majority of my gear talk in favor of saying the things I do that have helped me have a good time on the trail. I am courteous, I don't comment on other people's set ups unless prompted, I try to be hopeful if someone is having a bad time. I am not overly rosy either, sometimes people need to be given permission to realize they are making a bad choice, like not putting on rain pants when it starts to rain a little bit or skipping an opportunity to filter water. I have seen people talk in forums about not hanging bear bags or not filtering water. It's a seatbelt issue, just do it, peace of mind. Finally hike at a pace that makes sense. Fight that feeling that there's a rush. Maybe you have to rush to work but you don't have to rush on the AT. I say stop frequently, actually take off the pack, drink, eat something high energy, move forward. Done properly this doesn't take ten minutes and it's amazing how much your energy can increase. A small side note is that taking a very long break can let your muscles get cold which is less advantageous. What else? Keep your rain gear in a very handy place, always put on layers when stopping for any length of time, and HYDRATE hydrate hydrate. My personal who I am stuff..I am so honored to hit the trail for a second time, it feels lucky and it is...I am leaving nothing behind because I carry the ones I love in my heart...as incredibly corny as this is it is true. Also some more things: I am an atheist with a complex multifaceted spiritual worldview who supports Bernie Sanders (no surprise there) and I have recently quit my job because it stressed me the f* out. I have a Masters of Science. I have a Vizsla named Orwell for a dog and a Vermont rescue cat named Calvin. My fiancé is from Long Island and is in way better shape than me, more responsible (i.e. hasn't quit her job), but will join me for a month and perhaps a week here and there on the AT. I quit smoking cigarettes 4 months ago. So it goes. I will be turning 30 on the trail. I turned 24 on the trail last time, somewhere in North Carolina. Things I will really miss...mostly just constant reassurances from my fiancé that I am lovable. I hope to check in with her often via text but we have lived together every day with few exceptions for four years. 2 1/2 months before I see her. Longer than that apart.This is my first entry. I should stop. More to come.","Vermont

MAGYAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522106,"It is very difficult to wait. Even though I know that I will get to low points on the trail I feel as if Friday will never come, let alone the magical Sunday morning when I begin my journey back North on the Appalachian trail. For a relatable journal entry it might make sense to speak of a few fears I have. The first is that the trail will be completely, comically, overcrowded this season. I have heard that the movie Wild a la Witherspoon and Walk in the Woods might be attracting an even larger crowd than ever. As happy as I am that so many would consider such a journey I also know that our impact if not careful to practice versions of leave no trace could be ugly. That being said, I am very much hoping to fall in with a wise minded group of people. My second fear is weather. Of course it's weather. I am prepared but I also don't relish the idea of losing track of the trail under layers of snow and ice. I have been winter camping before and it is nearly twice the work. That being said it is something to write home about if I get stuck at a shelter, snowed in for days, surviving on rationed trail mix. Finally I fear of calamity back at home, some awful occurrence that would require me to come off the AT.That being said I look forward to at least twice as much as I am fearful of...such as being utterly physically exhausted at the end of a day. In real terms being physically exhausted is something I have not had enough of in the past few years, slugging away at school and working in mental health from the comfort of a chair. It may seem somewhat counterintuitive but being tired at the end of the day from nearly constant motion is incredibly good for me. I look forward to really enjoying food. Really appreciating every aspect of eating, because I am so exhausted and food is the great reward. Finally I look forward to being out of the loop, being somewhat isolated or at least exposed to new loops, so to speak.","Southern Terminus

MAGYAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522172,"Disclaimer: this one's a bit of a rant. Having a few days before heading down to Georgia I have been perusing forums that talk about the AT and hiking. I saw a post by an individual saying that ""real hikers"" avoid Springer in March like the plague. Asked to clarify what he meant by ""real hikers"" he (I'm assuming this is a guy) proceeded to say that base weight 5 lbs, 25 miles a day, etcetera was a ""real hiker."" This makes me flipping angry. I understand that the trail gets crowded and not everyone plans efficiently or realistically even for their journey but everyone has a right to be out there. It really makes me angry when these hiker snobs try to intimidate or scare people into thinking that they are hiking too heavy or have no real right to be on the trail. The truth is that human beings can put up with pretty much anything that doesn't kill them if they choose to and therefore any individuals ability to walk over 2000 miles has almost nothing to do with physical realities and a lot more to do with mental resources. That's why a post like this individual's could literally knock someone deserving off the trail, discouraging them to the point that they don't feel worthy. Yes, being reasonable in what you choose to bring is good. Yes, if you can flip flop or avoid starting in March its not a bad idea. The weather is the weather though and the time constraints are what they are so its not just ""real"" hiker starting in March. I wish I could shame this person. Also a word about gear. People have budgets and the really good stuff is very expensive. It's not important if your clever. It's also okay to have expensive gear, even if its just for short camping trips, if you want to invest. I am a hiking snob when it comes to a few things, I believe that expecting to make fires every night or at all is dumb, I believe that hiking in regular sneakers or certain other kinds of shoes is a mistake, etcetera. I guess what I want to remind the people who say things like this guy who posted about ""real"" hikers is that the trail is NOT theirs. It is NOT their land and even if they help maintain shelters or trail (I have done both) they have no right to mandate how other people enjoy it if they are enjoying it respectfully of others and the nature. Finally if you want to hike with a heavy pack and start on the romantic first day of Spring, it doesn't make you any less of a hiker.","Southern Terminus

MAGYAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522204,"Now that I am actively directing friends and family to this site I feel the need to be more specific regarding the preparations. First I should say that Kate and I have been discussing the AT since the Spring of 2015. As out of the blue as it is that I am starting on March 6th there has been plenty of prior contemplation. Our original goal was to both be in a place to hike this thru hike. I am honored to have a partner who is so supportive and who understands the likely necessity I have of being on the trail now, not tomorrow or the next year. This next part is more for the uninitiated who are unfamiliar with even the general terrain of the AT thru hike, north bound. People start early in the year because the undertaking generally takes from 5-6 months. Whew I said it, 5-6 months. Then there is the mileage, over 2000 to be considered a thru hike. The states are (from memory) Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine. All this to say, it is not a small task. It is a daily grind at times. I will be working hard, I will be living my life.I am making a lifestyle change as they say in counseling. For safety it is important to note that I have the right gear for all weather conditions I will encounter, good knowledge of the caloric requirements of hiking, knowledge of water safety, hygiene, basic common sense when it comes to towns and other people, funds for the trip, and lots of communication options including this journal. I have the capability of charging my phone three times without an outlet and the trail rarely takes on more than 3 or 4 days of hiking to hike out to a town or other facility. Logistics are easier than one would think, this is a populated part of the world and there are many many other hikers out there looking out for one another. The saddest risk I face on the trail is not a lion or a wicked witch but the injuries that any athletic endeavor can entail. To mitigate such possibilities I am hiking with much sturdier boots than most people go with. The new age of trail runners has not yet made it to my world. I hike with the old school (if boosted by lightweight wonder materials) ankle solid hiking boots that I find helpful for dealing with pack weight. I also rest when my body tells me to rest, I drink a ton of water, and I pay special mind to the end of the day. My hiking buddy (and overall best friend/mentor) once told me that the majority of hiking injuries occur at the end of the day, often on downhills. So I go slow when that part of the hike occurs. I also treat hot spots preemptively but my boots are nicely broken in (this is a blister comment). Last hike attempt I went off the trail because of back pain. My sciatic is much more under control now and I have trail vitamins (Ibuprofen) that I am hoping to use sparingly. Finally I will utilize a few key stretches early in the hiking day to stave off the worst kinds of back pain. I hike with a first aid kit.I know this is again a post full of basic stuff for any curious people reading that are not friends and family but hikers hitting the trail; I intend to write nearly every day while out on the AT. ""mile by mile its a trial, yard by yard its hard, inch by inch its a cinch.""","Southern Terminus

MAGYAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522240,"I am very lucky to have a great trail dog. Orwell is turning 4 years old this March. He is a Hungarian Pointer, Vizsla in Hungarian means pointer, a bird dog. However Orwell has extremely good recall for a hunting dog and stays close by on walks. He has been tested in the Green Mountains, the Adirondacks in NY, and many other places. Other than learning that he has a chronic no reason barking problem at camp, we have had no issues on overnight hikes. As you will see if you look at my photos he is in most of them. We left him behind for one camping trip into the White Mountains but otherwise he came along for the nearly 100 miles Kate and I logged on the trails last season. I will miss Orwell. I look forward to the stretch in VT where he will probably join the trail.","Southern Terminus

MAGYAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522539,"First entry via iPhone! I decided to split the drive from Vermont to Georgia into three days. On the road yesterday for 5 hours landing me in Storrs Connecticut where I was hosted by dear friends. John is a hiking enthusiast and I was honored that he approved of my gear selection. Lydia cooked an amazing meal of the sort you dream about when hiking, with homemade chocolate pudding for dessert. I am grateful to both of them. My rental car is a bit of a beast. I got easily encouraged to upgrade to 4-wheel drive so I'm driving a metallic blue Ford SUV with Jersey plates. No problems so far, just a lot of road. Thinking a lot about what I've just said goodbye to and the parts of life I have less control over now. Some sadness. Oh my what a real dear journal moment! Hiker hostel owner Leigh called to confirm the time they'll meet me at the car rental. Looking forward to being amongst people who know a lot about what I have convinced myself to hike! Hope all the hikers on the AT are thriving, I for one eager to get into those hills!!","

MAGYAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522985,"It's been a flawless first four days on the trail, with only a first sign of rain today climbing Blood Mountain. Despite its ominous name and that it's the highest peak on the AT in Georgia; not a tough climb. The harder part was trying not to trip over myself to get to Neels marking over the first 30 miles of the trail. What was spectacular and well worth it was the stairs next to the waterfall on the approach trail to Springer. Have met some good people and have enjoyed my overpriced tent immensely! It really is pretty cool. The shelters have been full and I have preferred my tent anyways. Stayed at Stover, Gooch, and then tented last night at Lancs creek. Hope everyone at home is well!","Georgia

Well myself and 4 other hikers went right past it. It's interesting how my sense of mileage is evolving. Starting to feel my legs getting slightly stronger if still getting used to some logistics. It's nice in Georgia with the gaps or ""stamps"" between climbs seeing views on either side. Another comment made is the fact that in this early spring before foliage we have a lot is stellar views. Sometimes in the morning the fog is so thick you can breathe it in. Still loving my big red tent. The goal for me at this point is to have my first night in seven in a ""real bed"" on Sunday in Hiawassee, GA. Lucky weather. Good company. Was able to FaceTime with Katelyn yesterday which was great.","Georgia

MAGYAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523237,"Hiking today with every intention to keep going until Sunday before resupplying in Hiawassee; my right knee started screaming. As I was just 3 miles from Unicoi gap (or unicorn gap) decided to go rest up in town. Staying tonight at the Holiday inn, for mainly the benefit of the hot tub. Was pleased to find a nice wine and beer shop across the street from the hotel and enjoyed a real southern all you can eat buffet at a steak house. Split the room with two thru hikers from Tennessee and am very happy to have learned that one of them worked at an outdoor gear shop before hitting the trail. It's really great how genuine hikers are and we've enjoyed some good laughs about hanging our bear bags in town or using the Holiday in privy. With certainly no intention of taking a zero day so early on I am glad to be keeping good company. I do know that today's knee pain warrants a 24 HR mercy rest and then I can get back on at unicorn gap and climb my way back into the applachians. I'm trying not to think of this as a setback of course but as a warranted break. It's 5-6 months so this stuff is okay. Hope everyone at home is okay. My big red tent (Hillberg Anjan 2) takes a break tonigh drying out. Feels good of course to be clean.","

MAGYAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523437,"After realizing that this journal can be used to calculate miles, I will be making an effort to utilize this function in the future. For now the mileage I've done looks like this: The approach trail from Amicalola Falls State Park was 8.8 miles; landing me on the mighty Appalachian trail on top of Georgia state's Springer Mountain. The first day, including the approach trail, I hiked 11.6 miles to land at Stover Creek Shelter. On day two I hiked out of Stover Creek for 13 miles landing me at Gooch Mountain Shelter. Day 3-Gooch Mountain Shelter to Lance Creek for 8.5 miles. Day 4-Lance Creek to somewhere past Bull gap (guesstimated mileage 10). Took another 10 mile day into Popular Stamp, catching me up to 8.6 miles to Unicoi Gap and hitched a ride to Hiawassee.Total Mileage...61.7Appalachian trail mile mark-52.9I apologize for the slightly boring nature of this journal entry. My knee feels much better. I have learned the acronym RICE (rest, ice, compress, elevate) and am taking it seriously. I have iced my knee three times today. I am also using Tiger Balm, wearing the braces I was recommended whenever I walk any kind of distance. I have well prepared my hike, and resupplied on dehydrated food, lunches, and snacks. I will be walking out of Unicoi gap somewhat heavy with enough food to get me to Franklin NC. I remember Franklin from my 2011 hike and look forward to being there...Lots of cool stuff to see on the trail ahead. The goal is to hike 6-8 miles a day with maybe one or two 10 mile + days if my knee is holding up optimally. It has been tough staying put in Hiawassee for two days. The trail is calling. It was good to speak to so many of you though. I have quickly lost the woods edge being in a hotel and feel ""soft"" again. My shuttle tomorrow takes me to Unicoi gap for a starting time of about 9:00. A word to future visitors of Hiawassee...friendly people here and the Holiday Inn was worth the extra money in my mind for the cleanliness and hot tub. They have laundry for a dollar on the third floor! The steak house leaves something to be desired but there is an all you can eat buffet which is decently priced at 8.95. I highly recommend the gear store located at the Budget Inn for its simplicity (run out of a small back storage area near the Budget) it has most of what you might really need to resupply. Ingles (supermarket) has everything else in terms of food.","

MAGYAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523736,"Made it to Dicks Creek the second stopping point for Hiawassee today. Three miles of knee pain. Opted to go to the Top Of Georgia hostel. Got advice from the hostel owner about a walk in clinic that charges 60 dollars for a consultation. At my appointment the very friendly Doctor walked me through a battery of tests. No pain there and there meant that the problem I've been experiencing is in fact from lack of stretching. My IT bands on both legs need stretching, which is excellent news as by doing a few simple stretches 2-3 times a day and continuing low mileage (6-8 a day) I should be stronger and in less pain within weeks. So great news. With this in hand I cannot wait to hit the trail again tomorrow. Hopefully I'll be in NC within two days or so and in the town of Franklin a couple out from there. I'm really looking forward to getting past the point I was at in the Smokies where I ended my hike in 2011. Now that I know I'm not doing long term damage I'm thrilled to be out here. I believe the endorphins alone are well worth it!","

Following doctors orders I stretched and my knees are starting to not hurt at all. I went from Hiawassee to the North Carolina border the first day (about 8 miles) to claim my first state. The next day I also limited my miles and was at Standing Indian shelter about 7 miles further. On the third day I could no longer hold back my glee at walking normal without pain and put in a 16 mile day, including Mt Albert. It was great. The trail was mostly this beautiful bench and nice grade. That night it got somewhat cold and I was happy to hike the last 8 miles to Franklin NC yesterday and sleep in a hotel. I've been hiking with a get eat group of people including Tumbleweed and Terrible Lizard, two girls from Buffolo NY. Humor and good spirits are awesome. Franklin was mostly closed down yesterday as it was Sunday. I've decided not to take a full zero today and get back out on the trail in the afternoon. Im too excited that I'm physically getting more fit and my knee pain has subsided with stretching my IT bands. What else? The AT really is a beautiful superhighway of a footpath. I'm continually impressed by its maintenance. Hope everyone at home is feeling well.","

MAGYAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524662,After a 12 mile day got to the Natahala Outdoor Center (NOC) that the AT runs right into. Two hikers that I have known since day 3 of this trip got us a cabin up the hill from the NOC and I was able to shower and do laundry. How is the hike going? Well me knees are almost completely without pain and I am starting to have real strength in my legs. The trail is a beautiful superhighway of a footpath and well maintained in North Carolina. We got some nice views on the hike. Setting up and breaking down camp can definitely be a task but I enjoy a good system for both. I have resupplied my food and probably have enough to get to the Smokies and into them before I need to resupply again. I will be in the Smokies before Easter! I have started anticipating what it will be like to pass the 200 miles I did in 2011. Very much looking forward to that smaller goal.,"

The Smokys were awesome and beautiful as one might expect. There was a natural bubble of hikers formed for the shelter system. I have been hiking with pretty much the same group since the NOC and Fontana dam (gateway into the Smoky national park. We had the opportunity to go for a quick lunch and light resupply in Gatlinberg on a 13 mile day that included Clingmans dome the highest point in the entire AT. I am feeling a new grade of hunger but not quite hiker hunger. It is certainly great to be in Hot Springs after the first month of hiking, a very friendly town that the AT runs right through. The social aspect of hiking is solidifying now that some have stopped and we are mostly at the same pace. It was a lot like freshman year of college this first month just meeting new people every day and at times an effort to make after an already physically challenging day. I am thrilled to be out here and to have passed the 200 mile mark where I stopped hiking in 2011. I am currently at mile 273. Went to the famous hot springs yesterday and sat in the mineral water. My group and I have realized that we could use more zero days. Since my knees have been feeling better I haven't taken any other than today and the two back in Hiawassee. We all continue to discuss the AT every day with even actual walking/hiking techniques especially as pertains to hiking poles have entered the discussion. We philosophize about why we are hiking and mainly what it takes to keep going. I've had some great conversations with people while walking the trail. Doing about 12 or more miles a day at this point and we all average about 2 miles an hour walking. Highlights of the walk wee seeing two sunrises while hiking in the dark in the Smokys, a place called Max Patch that is a bald with a 360 view and a sunset, and a very rough hostel in the deep woods called Standing Bear, run by a guy named Lumpy who was drinking a lot of real moonshine.

MAGYAR,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528475,"First I should make the disclaimer that I completely underutilizing trail journals. What has happened? I am currently a few days from Damscus and nearly 400 miles into the northbound journey on the Appalachian trail. Since I have not updated recently it stands that lots has happened. Hiking with Ladybird, California Crome, and Cheap and Easy has been a pleasure. I don't know of many hikers in the bubble that have such a consistent ""together"" hike throughout the days. We often converse as a group while putting in miles and otherwise break together most often and end up at the same end of day goal. The Nero days (short mileage day) we spent in Erwin TN were well hosted by Canterossa; almost a bed and breakfast with very comfy accommodations. We nearly destroyed a Huddle House with orders, breakfast and lunch as well as sundaes and milkshakes in one sitting. Moving on from Erwin without taking a zero (no hiking day) was fine except I came down with a cold in short order. We did order a pizza on the AT from a gap which was exceptionally novel. A trail angel suggested the possibility after he had fed us brownies and lemonade. Further on the third day in from Erwin we triumphed again with club sandwiches and milkshakes from a snack shop accessed from the woods off the AT at a hostel (greasy creek hostel). All the food interests withstanding I had a pretty bad cough and congested sinuses that shook my energy a good deal. Not until Roan (spelling) did I begin to hike at full capacity again. The reason I may not know how to spell landmarks on the AT is that my hiking friends have been handling logistics largely for, well, weeks haha! I have veto rights on over ambitious mileage or camp sites but gut hook is such a superior app to looking through my AWOL that I've become quite lazy. As I remain Magyar on this journal I have picked up the name ""fancy pants"" following my brief discussion with Matt or ""cheap and easy"" regarding brand name or generic vitamin I (ibuprofen). I have not found a need to take Ibuprofen more then once every three or four days now. I did use NyQuil and DayQuil over this cold thigh which was a blessing. Finally the trail itself: around Roan Mtn and past is some of the best trail we've encountered to date. Almost flat up a 6000 or so Ft mountain thanks to generous switchbacks! The bales that followed were spectacular as well. I am continually impressed by NC and TN though glad to have moved in permanence into Stan. I am excited as well to be headed to Virginia in short order. Tomorrow is the first zero since Hot Springs thanks to the generosity of Cheap and Easy and his family that are hosting at a family condo in NC. Frankly, as per usual these days, I have no idea where I am. It's about 25 minutes to the AT and we were picked up 3.5 miles or so from where the AT leaves NC for the last time. Doing well. Still no blisters, a tad more fit, enjoying the hike. Warmer weather is encouraging. Hope all are well.","
