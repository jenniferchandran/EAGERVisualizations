U-turn,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523794,"Hey out there. First, a little bit about myself. I'm 46, no kids (that I know of) & not married. Been stuck in one temp job after another since graduating from Iowa State in 2001 which has left my outlook in life a little grim. Which is why I want take on such a crazy idea as hiking the entire AT. It's gonna be tough at first, as I'm definably not an athlete...but hey, it's only walking . And so after over a year of planning and working 2 jobs this past year, my start date is finally in site! First, a BIG thanks to all my friends and especially family for all your support. I've wanted to hike the AT ever since I heard about it as a kid and even though I have little to no experience backpacking, it's now or never, and I can't wait for my adventure to start.","
