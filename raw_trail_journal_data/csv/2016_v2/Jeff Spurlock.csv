Jeff Spurlock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497877,"       Well... I guess the best way to start this is to say hello!!. About myself. now im a 28 year old (will be 29 by time the hike comes around) male who has not stopped thinking of doing this hike for about 5 years now. I live in myrtle beach south Carolina. Originally from elyria oh.        Being that I do live in Myrtle Beach I don't have many options to simulate what its like up there in the hills for training . So what I've been doing is watching you tube videos and trying to gain as much as I can from them. The reason why I am on here and starting this journal is to get ideas you guys have from your own personal experience. I will do my best to write here a couple times a week, but will check every day.    ",,Amazon.comcom lol,"May 31, Sun",0
Jeff Spurlock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/499185,"Hello again. Back for another entry. Feels like next year won't come fast enough. I've switched my interest of YouTube videos to books, which have been great for another perspective of life on the trail. Still gaining more and more equipment as the weeks pass. Just received my rain cover. Its a poncho that covers the pack as well. The reason for going that route is because of stories that I've heard of rain starting to soak through ones pack from your back. If anyone actually reads this I would love to hear any opinions on it. Well thats it for now. Will hit another entry when more supplies arrive.Jeff",,View Entry,"Jun 01, Mon",0
