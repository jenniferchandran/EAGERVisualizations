Cut n Shoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/463321,"I will not be hiking the AT till mid March but will start the journal now so as to keep a record of training and the purchasing and use of equipment. The training has actually been on going my entire life, always training for one thing then another. Work a 5 week schedule 5 on and 5 off, when on the boat walk the decks and train with cardio equip in the gym. Sadly when home not usually as dedicated, riding motorcycles, playing golf, drinking and eating all the wrong foods has been my standard recently. I have started section hiking locally with the LSHT here in east Texas and while the 126 mile trail isn't particularly difficult the heat certainly is. Off the boat again here in 2 weeks and am planning 2 or 3 3 or 4 day hikes on the trail over the next 5 weeks with a thru hike coming in the early fall....Will be experimenting with equipment and seeing how my pit Bella can handle it with her pack.

Cut n Shoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/463433,"Woke up this morning and alas I am still on the ship here. Oh well make the best of it. 12 more days and heading home, but first a 15 hour ride on a lovely supply boat into Halifax from there to the airport and home hopefully before midnight on the 10th. As I said before working out here on the boat, we have a pretty good gym with allot of cardio equipment. Spend about 1 1/2 hours there in the mornings and another hour on deck later walking for and aft throwing in a few ladders. Looking forward to hiking the LSHT when home but first getting acclimated to the heat back in south Texas. Spend a week or so working around the house before hitting the trail with back pack. It's nice and cool here where we are working about 120 miles off shore Halifax with little or no humidity.Enough for now....CheersEngineer",,Still on the boat,"Jun 27, Fri",0
Cut n Shoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/463639,"Still figuring out this site, so here goes again....I will make this my last entry till I get off the boat as there is just not enough interesting things here to write.Good workout this morning, 1 1/2 hours of pretty intense at least for me cardio, rowing, treadmill and elliptical. Also do an hour walk on deck adding in a few ladders along the way in the evening. Cannot wait to get home and get out on the LSHT and away from the water. The heat back home with the humidity will take a bit of getting used to as the temp here off the coast of Halifax is very moderate, with very little humidity........CheersEngineer",,Bored,"Jun 28, Sat",0
Cut n Shoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/470694,"Well back at work here on the ship. Still working off Halifax and should be for another 2-3 weeks. Then transiting down to the Gulf of Mexico until my retirement in Jan. Haven't been able to workout on board yet due to the amount of work for the job. Lots of problems and on my feet 12 hours a day is workout enough. Every time I get a bit stressed I go to one of my trail books, or here to trailjournal to get a bit of relaxation. I don't know how much more mental preparation for the AT I can do as I would leave tomorrow if I could. Still logistics and some equipment purchases to be made. The type of hiking I have been doing at home has allowed me a 45 pd pack, and just won't be able to do that in the mountains. So the lightening begins, meaning I'll probably ditch my old USMC 40 L pack, weighs about 7 pds by itself. Hate to lose the durability but it's just a bit much.I'll be posting occasionally on here to update workouts and to relieve stress. Cheers",,Back on the boat,"Aug 17, Sun",0
Cut n Shoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/473437,"Well back on the boat for my next to last trip. Leaving the sea for the woods will be a bit bittersweet but I am ready for it. Couple of changes in my plans, first no Bella with me. The wife is not too fond of that idea, not only me leaving for 4 1/2 months but taking her dog. I have to meet her halfway on this one. They will visit me a couple times while I'm gone so it won't be so bad.The second change is that I am going to hang on the trip, yes a hammock. Been doing allot of studying on this and my experience with yard hammocks has always been good so I figure why not. Looking specifically at the Clark NX250. If anyone has any opinions I would welcome them. I have been on the hammock.net blog and read all up on the Hennessy vs the Clark, and well I know a good bit more money but I really like the options on the Clark. Gonna order it here in the next couple days and try it out at my house and on the LSHT a bit.Workouts are going good, intense 1 hr of cardio in the mornings and I've taken to walking the decks with a 1/4 industrial HP water hose 15 meters long rolled up and carrying on my shoulders while walking. Does 2 things, simulates a bit of backpack weight and pressure on the shoulders right where the backpack straps ride. Additionally I am moving my start date to Mar 1st.....Cheers",,A couple of changes,"Sep 07, Sun",0
Cut n Shoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/473888,"Well 4 days left here, then to the dock in Halifax for an always welcome dockside crew change. Helicopters are not bad but supply boats are the worst. Home for 3 weeks then back out here for 3 weeks, the boat will be in the Gulf of Mexico when I come back so again, a short travel and good crew change (helicopter).Reading allot of posts off and on, enjoy all of them just some more than others. The reason for this long walk for me is a bit different than most I suppose. I want to see the beauty of course, meet people along the way I have something in common with, but both those things are simply perks for me. I am doing this for the physical accomplishment. I want to get up everyday and go as far as I can as fast as I can. All of this is of course tempered by conditioning, weather, preparation and other things, but still...that is my motivation. In my life I have run marathons, qualifying for Boston along the way. 100s of 5 and 10 K runs, 100 mile walk/run once. A few mini iron man triathlons and biathlons. The point you ask? Well I have always competed with myself. In my prep for this my conditioning is a competition with myself. Everyday I reach a bit more, to go further faster.....Please take this the way I have intended it. I'm not going to compete with anyone, this is no race, to be there and hopefully to finish is a win for me, but I'm not looking for any form of enlightenment, to be a better person, to have a better outlook, there is no deep psychological purpose for me I don't think? Never exclude any possibility I know but I'm going simply to finish. I'm a simple person, I'm kinda the guy they ask what are you thinking, and I answer cold beer naked ladies.

Cut n Shoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476407,"Well this writing finds me back on the boat with all the thrills and chills associated with being at work, at sea. Plans have not changed still looking for a March 9th start. Pretty well set on my starting equipment, have decided to hang on this trip...wait for it.....here it comes.... Clark hammock. Just hope it's as durable as they say. Included a pic this entry of my much better half who is behind me on this escapade oh I'd say 70% at this point. That is a far cry from the 10% a couple of months ago so things are looking up. As I said previous, no Bella I'm afraid, I hate some of you will miss meeting her but I believe she would just be more of a hindrance than help. Shes good on 2-3 day hikes, but not sure about 5 months.She and my wife are however planning on joining me a couple of times on the trail and going a few days with me, so all is not lost. Workouts / training are moving along fine, I have my weight where I want it and the aerobic conditioning is good. Hills will be the problem but if the cardio is good shouldn't take long to get the legs there. I also am open to a change in trail names, but will wait for some hopefully, trail family input. Engineer is pretty boring. Not too fond of the obvious ones such as, Harley...Tats...Biker Dude and such. Hope everyone else is on schedule and I can't tell you how much I am looking forward to meeting many of you and taking the challenge.",,Just another day,"Oct 13, Mon",0
Cut n Shoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515372,"Hello.....well lets get this started yet again. The plan was for 2015, but retirement was delayed by a deal I could not refuse. Now we are looking at 2016, and while my physical preparation is not up to the standard it was this time last year I hope to get it there soon. I am doing it for all the same reasons...sounds like a song...and things are no different just the year. Start date is first of March, still gonna hammock....Bella is still not allowed to accompany me, wifes rule. My theory is to walk as much and as fast as I am physically able. I will stop and hang out as needed, and do plan to enjoy myself. Presently I am on a ship in the Red Sea doing a job for Aramco, and may be my last job for this company that has been so good to me. We'll see.",,View Entry,"Oct 08, Thu",0
Cut n Shoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515950,"This writing still finds me working in the Red Sea, job concluding at the end of the month. Will find out in mid November if they will offer me another extension,oil and gas is at and all time low so just not sure of my future. Part of me hopes to get another extension, as i don't know where the industry will go from here and the other part of me is ready for a layoff with a package, and to be on the trail in March. I will be 62 at that time and time is becoming a luxury I will not have much longer. My fitness and health is still good,and that's the only way I will have it for the trail. So it is a wait and see situation right now, 20 yrs in the oil industry has taught me to ""wait and see"" well. Also to note, I changed my trail name to Cut n Shoot, thought it sounded cool, it's the name of the town I live in in Texas. Engineer was lame.",,Still on the boat,"Oct 17, Sat",0
