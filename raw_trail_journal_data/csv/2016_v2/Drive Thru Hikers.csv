Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598166,"We left for Maine; we drove like 13 hours and then spent the night in Rochester a suburb in New York. And then we got up and drove another 8 hrs to Portland Maine. At the airport at 4pm to pickup our rental car, then we drove   to Kingfield, Maine and got a room on the third floor of the Herbert Hotel. No elevator, an old-fashioned old Hotel. We got that for 3 nights.OK On Friday Sept ninth we got up at six am in Kingfield at the Herbert and got ready to do a hike. Get our stuff ready. Went down to the cars, drove over to the market across the street. And got our breakfast sandwich and some coffee. Then we took the cars out to the old railroad bed off of hwy142 and East Madrid road and Oberton stream. And the road was the same as last year, five miles of rough gravel ending 1.5 miles from the A T. We just had to go slow because it was a rental car. Dropped the rental car out there, coming back there was a guy in a truck and said, are we lost. We said we are just dropping our car for the day. And then when we got back into Kingfield we stopped at the market again and got another coffee. And we had to drive out past the carriage road.    So we took hwy 27 north out of Kingfield to Caribou Valley Road. And went back there to the gate and started walking at 9:50.  And about ten o'clock we're up at the A T crossing and we started hiking. So we started going south. You know like a tenth of a mile you come to the Caribou stream crossing. And there's just people milling around everywhere. All these young people, I don't know what they're doing, having breakfast whatever. And so it was a little bit hard because you do a little rock hopping and there was a plank across middle of the stream.  I felt like everybody's watching, you know like, the two old people, what are they doing.  But we made it across and then it just starts going up. And the people kept coming down the mountain. And just one through hiker after another. And then we just climbed and then it got worse. You complain and you throw your poles. And you keep going at it. I was having some intestinal issues and finally it is one spot that was hard to get up. Terry was going up ahead and I was going to go up there, and then I said, I must do my duty right now. So I managed to just get off the trail at this cliff area, had some issues. Then I got back and finally got up there and caught up with Terry, or he waited I should say. And I don't know if we're going to be able to do this hike. Got to Sugarloaf Side trail and it was twelve thirty three and we'd only gone Two point three miles. We did know that we have a conditioning problem, but the answer is to push on.  We sat there for lunch and talked to this hiker Thisyear, an older guy.  Well first Moonshine was sitting there, a young girl having her lunch. And we didn't talk too much to her. And then Thisyear comes up and he's an older guy and he wanted to talk, he was a very talkative person.   Oh yes he had Chicago Cubs hat on, and he asked us where we were from. When he heard we were from Illinois, and then he tells us his story, he’s on a ten year hiking plan.  He has 320 miles to go and his wife said, Get out there and gets it done, Thisyear.  He’s on his way.  Then we continued on a little before 1:00pm. Did we go down, then go back up. I can't remember anymore. We had to get on the big Mt, get up on Spaulding. Although they never did take you right up on top.  But it was four thousand feet tall, that was a real hard climb. OK I don't have much memory of it anymore.  This reminds me of a hike up Quandary Peak in Colorado. Its all about the next 100 yards. When I get up there I will decide if I want to quit. You keep doing that to the top. Now we're like late, behind schedule, we decide to really hit it hard from there.  We had to go over a few more bumps.  And then we're just really walking fast, right down to the railroad road.  We knew we were running out of daylight, and so we pushed.  Of course the trail was easier then.  I don't know when we came out to Perham stream and the old road. Road looked fantastic and then we crossed that.  Might have tried parking down Perham road 1.5 miles but we are doing a longer hike. Two miles to go there and then we pushed it.  Maybe you're right, maybe it was six thirty we came out at Oberton Stream. Now its 1.5 mile side trail to the car. There were a few guys sitting there on the railroad bed, hikers or campers and we said, ""We’re going home"". And then we talk to another guy, and we said yeah we got a car right down here on this road 1.5 mile. That’s a great idea he said.  But I finally decided it had to more than a mile and a half because it was like seven twenty before we came out of there.   Daylight was going, didn’t have to use your head lamp.  We were worried about the car, because that morning, right at the parking area, you said you really banged the oil pan hard.  So I thought, oh my god, we get back and the car won’t run. But it did and it got us out of there. Just a mile from our parking spot we see 2 moose next to the road. We try to get pictures but they are in the brush and its getting too dark. We had to drive all the way around to get our car from Caribou Valley Road.  It was ten o'clock when we got back to Kingfield, yeah.","Caribou Valley Road

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598167,"Friday night we got back at ten o'clock everything was closed. So we had bought milk and ice that morning when we ran through town for the shuttle.  That night we knew we were going to be late. So we bought milk and ice and left it in our room.  So we get back to our room that night. We shower and eat cereal and then Terry says lets go do the Bigelows hike tomorrow. Even after everything we went thru today.
 But we get up earlier Sat, I finally agreed to five thirty. So we were up at five thirty, got on the trail like an hour and a half earlier. Got up got out of there sooner, like six fifteen. At the market, breakfast, extra sandwich for lunch. And then we go down to. Go to Stratton Brook road and drop off the rental car. And then we come back around, take the carriage road to east Flagstaff to Safford brook trail. There was a group of people there; they were a working group heading out for the day. But we beat them out of there.    We got on the trail at 8:15am. Almost like an hour and a half earlier, nine fifty yesterday. And actually that trail it wasn't bad. It went up, but it was a good trail, we made good time. We were up at the A T intersection before ten so we thought; OK we're doing pretty well here. We sat there and had snacks you know and a squirrel was begging. Oh well the work group did go by us, I think the only people on the side trail. And then we go on.  Climbing up Avery Peak at 10:05. Going up and it was steep but not bad, not too bad.  Kind of like you're trying to find your way around through boulders and stuff, but you know it's OK.   This was a Saturday, and we thought there'd be a lot of hikers, and there were some  out there just going up for a day hike, just up to Avery Peak and back. And camping and backpacking, a lot older couples. Well that's true, some people, because there is a campground up there between the two peaks.  And there are other campgrounds, and there's other side trails. We found out a lot of them are using this Fire Warden's trail. So we finally get up on Avery Peak now. I think maybe twelve thirty there, and it’s windy.  I mean it's beautiful, although it had been overcast, but then the sun came out among the clouds and blue sky.  When you get up to one point, you turn around, you see that whole big lake, and you know it's spectacular.  All around you, like a three hundred sixty degree view. You can see the airport down out of Carabasset. So it was a beautiful view but the wind, you get up above tree line. We sat there and had our lunch behind this little man made shelter to protect us from the wind. And talk to a few people you know and listen and a lot of people like to go over to the West Peak also.  Around one o'clock we headed off. They take you steeply down on rocks. You are trying to figure out how to get down. And then if people come in the other direction, everybody’s got to take their turns. Your finally get down in between the peaks and there is a nice caretaker building and campsite with flat platforms for the tents. And steeply back up to get on the West Peak.  They’re both over four thousand feet. And it's just slow going and we keep at it. We didn't really stop at the west peak. We took a picture or is that where the guy took a picture of us. Yes we talked to him and we talked to a few people and they all seemed a little surprised, we said we’re going over to the road. And so then we head down.  The South Horn is three miles away. My God, you can see the Horns over there. And you go; oh they’re going to take us all the way over there. And so you go down down down down down.  Was that when we were going down, and the two older ladies were coming up. And they were, my God they were hurting. And I felt, I know exactly what they're feeling. And we talked about how long it took them to get here from Stratton Brook, about 5 hours.  We knew we were in trouble, our conditioning has got us in trouble again. So you get over and you do the South Horn. South horn, where we looked out and it was real windy and you took my picture. And we kept on because it was 5:30pm, getting really late and we knew we had like five miles to go.  So then we head down and pass the side trail off to the other North Horn.  Keep going down finally get to Horn Pond Shelter. And the caretaker is sitting there and Terry promised me I could Rest for five minutes or so. But luckily there was some camping guys going down to filter some water. And we're almost out, so Terry asked if he could get some from them. So he went with them and I sat and talked to Aaron the caretaker. She’s a young gal and I had fun talking to her, got to rest.  When Terry comes back its like, Wow Lets go, let's go. So we went on, charged as hard as we could. And we had talked about it with the caretaker and some of those hikers.  OK we're pretty sure we know we're going to be hiking in the dark. Caretaker said well you want to get down past this one intersection. The trail gets better just a little bit before that intersection at 2.5 miles. We did get our headlamps out, and we finally did make it there. But I mean this is after how many more little humps. So I mean up and down and up and down. And some really steep downs before dark. We’re kind of right in that transition of darkness, how is it going to be with the headlights. At the intersection, Bigelow range trail, I read the sign and I head down A T trail. I don't see any blazes and I'm all kind of panicked.  And finally Terry agreed to go back up and read it. And he says we're on it. So I mean that was a mistake, you don't want to get too far not knowing where you're at. But then the trails got better, and were hiking along in the dark using our headlamps. Just keep going on, and the trail was easier. It is going down gradually then has a few steep spots.  We came to the camp site and we have one mile to go to the car. Yeah that Cranberry campsite.  It was like 8:00Pm . it’s only one more mile after that.  So that was a good thing, we knew we only had a mile.  Then you start crossing the boardwalks in the dark, which is kind of weird, like what's down there. And finally come to the bridge over Stratton Brook. But I thought, oh my God, it’s like a tenth to the car. And then the trail takes you up you go up a really steep hill. And then you get up there, and then they take you down, and then you finally come to a flat road with a trail register.  You go, oh my God, we're almost there.    Finally at nine twenty I think we made it out.   Anyhow we got in the car.    It’s like nine forty, we know where a couple grocery stores are, but they are both closed.  We’re not eating tonight.    I also forgot to bring the water from the hotel this morning and and Terry forgot to pack the Sawyer filter this morning. we had to go to a store and buy a gallon of water. So thank God, we did that. Even with our poor conditioning and poor planing, It was still a wonderful day in the Bigelows. Taking tomorrow off, and driving to Pine Ellis in Andover Sunday.","Safford Brook Trail at AT

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598188,"Sunday we drove to Andover, Maine and got a room at Pine Ellis
   About the lady who own the Pine Ellis, Eileen, I think the story was her husband that started it and he died about nine years ago. And she seems to be in her seventy's or near it.  Runs the place and then this other gal, Naomi the manager,  she's very involved in working there.  We met some hikers Sunday night at Andover store , Avalon and Say Hi. We were in the store Sunday night checking out the store and this guy comes up behind me and starts talking to me. Terry was there and we talked about hiking the trail and other things.  I said I saw you on the couch earlier; you’re staying at Pine Ellis. He recognized me and then and said he was glad the young guy offered to take my big luggage upstairs. We talked a little bit and we asked his trail name which was  Lego. Oh how did you get that? When you get Back to hostel I’ll show you.  So when we did get back he showed up downstairs.    And then I asked about his trail name. And so he went up stairs to get something and come down and Terry was at car.  He shows me this little head lamp he says his three year old grandson gave him to take.   When Lego was packing his own head lamp, grandson says, no no papa, and he brought his little Lego guy, whose legs turned up, and they got a little light in them. So he was carrying that along the trail. Then he had a call from his wife.  We went up to bed. 
 We got up at five thirty at Pine Ellis in Andover on Monday, September twelfth. Got out of there at six fifteen, I think. I had some coffee downstairs  , that's when we trying to talk to Avalon and Say-Hi more.  Thru hikers we have talked to in Maine, they're kind of ready to be done with the trail. We went up to the General store and diner.  We had breakfast there and sat at the Diner counter. Biscuit and gravy and bacon egg cheese for the trail. Oh yeah bacon egg and cheese. we bought three of those, to go.  OK so we had good food. And then we did our shuttle, and we had to drive the cars up to East B Hill road. Left the rental car there, and go around to South Arm road and about eight fifteen we started.      We went south, had to cross the brook right away which wasn’t too hard, and then it was a real nice camping area on the other side. I had to go do my duty, and there you just get right back on the trail, and there's a privy, that’s how that works.  And then the trail started up.  I want to say steep up but it wasn't horrible. I don't think that part was horrible.  We kept going. There is no real bad spot, just steep and you know a long way.  To make it up there in one point three up and one point four down.  I don't remember times anymore but going down was a lot steeper. There were even a couple places with rebar handles and stuff.   Three hours and we got all the way down to Sawyer Creek.  It was good. But on the way down there's a guy, other people starting to come by, and   this older guy I think   sixty three. So we started talking for a while. His trail name was Sky Dog Named after an old dog he had, lived to be seventeen. Only pup that survived a coyote. They are from Wyoming and he was very shocked when he came out to start a trail. How bad it was. How steep up and down and the trails were not great. Because he thought it would be like out west.   And then we made it down to Sawyer Creek, cross it, and there's a picnic table that he already told us about. So we took a good break for twenty minute, but took our shoes off ate our lunch, just taking our time, it was around eleven thirty. And then we start up again and. So the first mountain was called Moody, but the next hour we're going up Hall Mountain.  and there's a lean to it top , Hall Mountain lean to, but it's very steep and rocky and just Hard going. We got up there at 1:00pm. We took another break from one to one thirty.  We thought this is going to be really an easy 6 miles, most of it down. We had a little up, just had to do up to Wyman Mountain. and then pretty  well all down. So we talked to the group of peopleat the shelter, including Avalon and Say hi. And then they took off.   So I had a nice rest there. Then we started up again, Wyman Mountain.   Now it's two thirty, and we get up to the top of Wyman Mountain and we stop for a minute.   Yeah that was just a hard Mountain, it just seemed like it went on a lot further than the profile. And then we said; now we can still get to Surplus pond at four, that’ll be easy enough to do.  Anyway we didn't make it at 4:30. We made it at 4:45. Well we left the pond at 5:00.   We can see six thirty as a possibility for coming out. So finally get to the top and then start down.  I mean that's nice, but it just seemed like more, and then it seemed like a nice trail. And we started talking and just had Great time. And we thought that we're doing well, but time just keeps going by. And finally it was 6:20 we come to East B Hill Rd. Right, we said ten hours for ten MILES.  I think that's NOT good. Lets just say it again, our conditioning is poor in 2016. But if conditioning is our only issue, we will get our 72 miles in, including Katahdin. So then we ran around got the other car and then came back to hostel at like seven thirty. Quick shower and here it is going on eight o'clock.  We went over to the Mill market. So then we had pizza because that is all she was willing to cook after 8:00PM. And the local guy was there again, we talked to him for quite a while.  When he found out Terry worked for Boeing And his son works for Lockheed Martin. He just talked a lot about airplanes. OK so these four hikers our age, sixty, they come in the market there. And they're looking for food too. And I think they ordered pizza.   But didn't talk to them that night. We go to bed.","South Arm Road, Black Brook ford

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598362," I'm going to start it Tuesday September thirteenth. We slept in and went downstairs to get coffee and muffin at Pine Ellis where we spent the night. We started packing up. Well the checkout was 11:00 but the sign said between 9:00 and 11:00 get your gear out to start cleaning.  So as we were taking stuff out of the car, we noticed the four people, three guys and one gal, that we had seen in the marketplace the night before. They were sitting around talking and Terry and I get a Map. So we set up on the porch on the swing. And then we start listening to their discussion. It sounds a lot like us and they knew about the road going in from The Success pond.  Going back to where you can hike in two miles to the Mahoosuc notch. So I told Terry, I am going to go talk. So we started talking to the one guy in particular and the gal too. So it turns out that this guy Reconnected with an old navy buddy through the guy's girlfriend. On Face book, and got together for a hike with him and he brought another buddy from Myrtle Beach South Carolina.  The couple actually lives in Maine.  Tony Jones and   Carmichael.  So they're having the same discussions about how to do things. But they did mention that they just did Bald Plate the today before. And it was not as bad as you would think. They came in after dark. Yeah they were pretty late getting in too.  But it encourages us to think we could do it as a day hike, especially if we get stronger.  Its fun talking to them and then we finally got ready and left. Headed to up to Millinocket, we decided to head on up. And it's a three hour drive. Beautiful day, oh yeah would have been a beautiful day for hiking, fantastic except maybe warm. We decided to ease up.  We did hit it hard those three hikes, those first three. So we head up to Millinocket. We go to our usual Hotel.  Ruthie's Terrace Hotel. And sure enough they had a room. That same room number fifteen that we've always got. We get it for 2 nights. So that's Tuesday. Went out to eat.  Scotic Inn, Downtown. And we toured the town. Ate Scotic pizza and listened to a bunch of guys who summited Katahdin that day. Oh yeah so you get to see through hikers coming in after the summit. Anybody who summited, everybody who summitted. But somewhere in there, when we first got here you rested and I went shopping. I went to Rite aid and I went to the grocery store. So that was about it. We were tired. And crashed. No plans for the next day.  So next day we took off. I was surprised.  I think Terry's heels were bothering him. So the weather was hot. That’s right that was Wednesday the fourteenth, and it was like hottest day.   It was supposed to rain later that afternoon and evening and trying to drizzle that morning already. Drizzle started early, drizzle then light rain for most of the day. And then towards evening, when it was supposed to rain, it kind of cleared up. It got cooler, so we did our shopping and drove around.  It’s been a bad day for hikers. We did take several hours; we brought our Backpack in and tried to make sure we knew what was all in there. So we had breakfast here this morning and then that evening we had supper here.  We had talked to the owner we told her we needed reservations for Friday and Sunday.  She says well we're not going to clean our room for one night.  Just go ahead and keep keys and you know we'll talk about it later.  OK So our plan was to get up really early tomorrow. ","Zero Day

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598364,"Thursday September fifteenth. We got up at four forty five. And didn't take it's very long about twenty minutes and we were out the door and we went to McDonald's. We bought breakfast and lunch then we went to the gas station to get coffee. Terry says we forgot and went to Dunkin Donuts. So I went back to McDowell and been using our McDonald's app, getting free stuff so we got a free breakfast biscuits sandwich worth like three dollars and thirty cents. And went back for coffee and get a free Mc caffee. So that's starting to come in handy now. Then I went back and got Terry and decided I had enough gas, it was just a little under half. I said not worried about it. So we go through town, get out of town, we're heading towards Joe Mary. And we end up pulling up there at six o three and Terry thought he read where that they open at 5:00am; well the sign says they open at six. So it's like, perfect. Go in, and the wilderness gate lady is there. Talk to her we end up paying just twelve dollars for me. Terry is now old enough that he doesn't have to pay. And we told her our whole plans. Went on in, drop one car off at Jo Mary road went on down into the Nahmakanta lake access road parking. And we end up getting on the trail at seven thirty. A.M., we were hiking south. And it turned Out, the trail it was so nice. The trail was a little rocky and rooty but not bad, level. but the backpacking  it's hard first, that's true, the backpacking took a little getting used to, just to get that pack situated right on you. And of course you know you got more weight to carry. And it made your C.G. off. You’re stumbling. They take you along like this river for a long time it's very pretty. Nahmakanta river same as the lake. And. We finally start seeing one or two people coming the other way. And went by a campsite there and went by Tumble Down Dick trail. I’m going to e-mail that to Dick. We were always surprised at our time. That’s like 1.8 miles and we did it in forty min. I don't know any more, but we were surprised, we thought we were pretty fast. You keep following that river but then at some point the trail just gets unbelievably really nice. And I mean I pushed it, because I say, I want to push it now just in case there's a chance we could walk out. So at 9:30 we are Four miles in to that camp site, the first camp site.  We are doing two miles per hour, so we were surprised.  At 2.5 hours we were 5 miles in. At 11:30am and 7.8 miles we get to and that's a weird name, Potaywadjo springs lean-to. We were hoping by noon, but I think by eleven thirty. Four hours and half way and 7.5 Miles. And then we even took a whole half hour break. I had to use a privy and we came back and took shoes off and had our lunch. And we said this is crazy, noontime, we're heading off, you know got half of it done.   Before the sandy beach was that viewpoint. Oh my God, I walked out, it was only one hundred feet off the trail, and I go out there and I look to the North.  Oh my god And Then Terry comes out. I said, be ready because it was quite the view. OK it was quite a view of Katahdin. And so we sat there for a few minutes taking pictures. And we went on. And then it was the logging road. Oh that was a good one too. At about 8 miles, somewhere in there you could hear this truck you and then finally it sounds closer and closer.  Its right over there, right there is the road, just real close.  I'm watching and listening and you can hear it.  I look through the trees straight ahead and there was a truck going right across the trail. Turns out there's a logging road there, and they're using it.  We might have been able to use it, but we don't know, and now it's a moot point. Because we've done it all.  So then we come to the Antlers Camp site which is four point two miles to go. And we take a nice long half hour break there. And beautiful setting, lots of neat tent sites. And while we're sitting there having a snack bar, a Guy comes up behind us and kind of scares me.  He's a thru hiker and we talk to him for quite a while about through hiking. And how he's a little bit disappointed, he said bitter. The way people just skip parts of the trail. Skip miles on the trail and call themselves through hikers. His trail name is Outback. He was interesting to talk to. And then other people come up and we get ready we leave. Took a half hour break. So now it's maybe just three.  Yeah three with four point two to go.  And the trails not bad and I know every now and then you get some board walking. And actually that's not bad because you can I think of it as a highway, go faster than if you're walking through the bog and through the stones. So we start to meet a few thru hikers. And this one lady comes up asks How far was the campsite. We said twenty minutes. And a few minutes later another gal comes up, how far to campsites, about thirty minutes.  We stop and talk to her and, did she tell us what her trail name was. She asks for M and Ms because we told her we’ll see her tomorrow or the next day. She says get me M and Ms. We saw several dogs, people walking with their dogs. The first one was two gals and they ask us if we will just stand there and let them walk by. And they have an awesome dog, he's Swiss Army dog. Stop and talk to them for a bit. And their section hiking and they are Buttercup and Dr Gadget and the dog, Miss Barkypants. They are not summiting this year because their husbands wouldn't come up and get the dog.  We saw a pit bull and then we saw another two dogs. They just walked right behind their owner and didn't bother you at all, just kept going.  And then we went across a Ford, We had to go across several little pond inlets. But none of them were too hard.  You just get right across rock hopping.  There was a new strange bridge with the road at about 2 miles to go.  You come across another old road but the bridge was nice. It's just a mile up from where we had tried to park a car.  We already decided that wouldn't help too much. It did not cut off very much. And we keep going on. You get some longer boardwalks there.  Maybe the boardwalk wasn’t here when people used to complain about the bog or during the rainy season. But those boardwalks, you can make some time. Then you go around a lake and back on an old road.  Much earlier we passed a couple order guys and they said they just seen a moose down by the lake but we never saw one.  Then finally you get on this old road, which for the most part isn't bad. Sometimes it gets a little rocky, rooty. But we were making good time. Because at quarter to five we come out of the woods at Jo-Mary road. We had to reshuttle the cars for tomorrows hike.  As it turned out we didn't need to backpack. So we reposition the cars and left the rental car down at pollywog stream. And then we headed out, back into town. When we got there it was actually early enough, Cleaned up and we went into Ruthies restaurant here and managed to get some food. So it was not seven thirty yet because they were locking the door at 7:45pm. So that all turned out very nice. Ruthie did see us here; she knew that we got back. That we are not camping tonight.","Nahmakanta Lake access road

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598366,"Friday September sixteenth. We get up at like five thirty. We pretty well have our backpacks all ready. And we went up to McDonald's and got our Sandwiches for breakfast and lunch. And then we headed out to the Abol Bridge. Drive along and were on the actual Baxter State Park road. And there's this big giant boulder popping out of the asphalt. It was marked, someone painted it, but still it was very shocking that it would actually be there.  Make it to Abol Bridge, park the car.  Not very long we have the packs on, walking away. And I think it was Seven Thirty five. We walked across the bridge and I managed to get the cell phone and I called dad and I got him. And so I knew everything was OK. Walked down the road just a little bit and A T trail goes off into the woods. And it was 7:45am. And we started walking. First the trail was just fantastic. And then it got back to being rooty and Rocky, where you always have to watch your step, trying to figure out where you are going.  People they started coming, not a lot. And started Going up I guess. Beginning to go up some mountain. First you go up some little mountain and back down and there's a lean to.   Ten thirty or so get to Hurd Brook lean-to at three miles. OK three point three actually.  So I guess took couple hours. There was a guy sitting there ready to leave. We didn’t really talk to him. I don't think the lean-to was too inviting, we did sit there and I think we Rested. Did our duties. When you head off you have to cross it creek. Rock hop, I mean Boulder hopping and not rock hopping. And then you go on, and of course you have this stupid stuff, wet areas and then you get a rocks you get roots. Finally, we get to the ledges and its noon or right before. And I can get through again. And talk to my dad. We ate lunch there. And Terry started on; I talked to my dad for a little bit. And then when I got done with him, I called my brother. You were taken way to long. Yeah I know Terry was upset with me. OK Also the beautiful view of Mt Katahdin from there looking north. And it was just a beautiful day sunny and warm; we haven’t talked about weather much. OK then you go down from the ledges. And. Finally you come to the big big lake. Rainbow Lake, and we sat there on a rock. And snacked and rested and then you get back on the trail.  They do this stupid stuff where they take you away from the lake and then back down and up. Trying to remember, we saw a couple of guys. It is very pretty and we saw a loon. They were making some noise. Kept hiking and I was ready for to be done and just kept going. Was there anything else? And then finally we get to the campsite Rainbow Lake.  You wanted to get some water at that stream. Yes I did get water from the stream before the campground. And then we ended up going to the campsite, we got there about 4:00.  And then we looked around. Eleven point four miles. And we looked around, and there were just a couple of spots.  We didn't go up the Mountain to look for camp spots, but there was some up there. So we just picked this one spot near water. We are the only ones there.   Terry made the announcement; well it looks like it's just going to be you and me tonight. Kind of a weird feeling thinking you are all alone in the woods. Well less than one hour later the whole place was full. Everybody started showing up and pitching tents pitching their hammocks pitching whatever.  The two gals that we had met a couple days ago, Buttercup and Dr Gadget with the dog Miss Barkypants. They showed up to talk a little bit. Well had our tent up by then. Here comes a couple guys in. They set up right there behind us.   We were having supper in our tent; we could hear them talking back there about people on the trail. Yeah and they mention Outback and then Terry goes, those are two guys that saw the Moose the other day. And we'd seen them, we went by and they told us about it. And then later we met Outback at the Antlers camp and he said he would have liked the summit with them. And that they'd sent him a picture of that moose they saw. Outback talked quite a bit with us that day. So somewhere in there, I came back out, we both came back out, and I went up and talked to the girls for a while. Terry talked to Hammer and I.P.A., that’s the two guys. And Hammer told Terry about the great piped spring. And it's beautiful down there with the sun shining on the trees and water. So Terry says, I hadn't seen the pipe before, so then when I come back from talk with the girls, Terry says let's go back down and see the beautiful View. So we look, and it was very pretty. And the loons talking and the Sun is going down and so we go back up. And it's probably about six thirty by then. Hammer and I.P.A. have been hiking together not quite half the trip. And the Hammer is from North Carolina and I.P.A. is from Connecticut. And they plan on summiting together. We find out in the morning that they were going to hike all way to Katahdin Stream campground. And they're coming in to Millinocket before summiting. They’re supposed to be at the Appalachian Trail lodge. Waiting for good summit day.","Abol Bridge

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598371,"You know today is Saturday September seventeenth. And we spent the night at the Rainbow Springs campground. So we so we went to bed really early. As the sun went down, I didn't get up at all over tonight. And then I don't know what time it was, I heard I guess it was, one of the guys alarm go off. And then they started stirring. And I could hear them talking. Yes eventually Terry and I got up. Got up and sat up and had a breakfast. But I could hear the guys out there talking. And so finally, I told Terry, I have to go to the bathroom.  Then I went up to talk to them for a while. They told me the whole story. They want to get this message to Outback. I told them that at the Ledges you can get a signal.  I remember sitting there talking to those guys when my watch alarm went off at seven o'clock. But they're going to go to, Sunday they're going to   go to Bangor to get a car. And come back and summit Tuesday or Wednesday whenever the weather breaks, you have a nice day. So Hammer has not seen wife in long long time. Now and she was going to come up for the weekend, but he told her no, it was not worth all the money.   She was going to drive up, and he goes that's like twenty hour one way trip. I said no way I could do that.  The plan is they found a Flight out of Hartford Connecticut where I.P.A. is  from. And he will just fly out from there. So they left plenty of days for the summit and drive down to Conn.  They left and then we finally get out of our tent. We don't know what we did when we were first ones arrived and last to leave. So it was like eight thirty eight I think you told me when we were leaving. Not too long after that and here comes Outback Down the trail. Like an hour behind. And he said, oh I have a head cold; he wasn't feeling good or strong. But he did want to catch up with those guys. It had not worked yet. And then some other people came along.  They all said they were remembered seeing us from the other day.  The trail today still rocky and along the lake, a lot of Rock, muddy, up and down. You know more the same.  Six point two miles. Terry is tired. Terry is dragging back there and I said OK, let's give you some caffeine pills, so he took those at the lean to. Which was a very nice lean to right on this stream. And we sat there, Rainbow Stream lean-to, it was only 2.5 miles ago.  So we slog through a long time, to get there. And after that we saw the gal, She says her trail name is GaMela. You get GA for Georgia and Me for Maine and la because her real name is Melanie. And she couldn't believe it; we had M and Ms for her.  We stood there and talked to her for 10 min.  She had asked for m and ms two days ago. So she apologizes for asking for something.  We said don't worry about it, if you want them. So she was anxious to be done with the trail. Everyone wants to be done with the trail. And we went on and we did end up seeing the older guy that has Parkinson's, or seems like he has that, the gals have told us about him. Right so we have no complaints in life. Then we kept going along another stream or same stream.  It’s very pretty has a lot of cascades and then finally we leave that, and we head up over, going to a different drainage area. I look down there, and I ask Terry what does that look like down there. And it looked like two people and, they saw us and got up, they’d been sitting on this log, kissing. They said oh the roads back there a ways. So we kept going. And Terry told them we were at our car. Oh yeah Terry I don't know why he did that. It was like almost like bragging, but just rubbing it in that we're getting off trail and eating whatever food we want, pizza. And then there was two guys that walked in. and we walked out there was a truck there, but there was like a big tent and someone was washing in the creek. ATVs coming whizzing by. It’s a different world.  On a Saturday it’s different. And you're thirty miles down the gravel road and it was twelve forty in the afternoon. It took a whole hour to drive the back roads to the gate.  We had to pay for me and then we went out, came back to Millinocket, we actually came to our hotel room. Ruth came out andTalked to us for awhile. We cleaned up and said we got to get our car. That's what we did and we came back into town. Well we went to Abol Bridge and I told Terry, I want to go into the Camp store there because I want to see about postcards. So we pull up and see all the hiker backpacks sitting out.  A couple of guys, one was Outback and this other guy we're talking to him. And Outback knew us of course. But then the other guy goes Hey I've seen you guys before on the trail, yeah yeah maybe several times. Outback said he has been waiting to hear from us about what we had found out about hammer. Hammer and I. P. A. had written everything in the ledger Rainbow Stream lean to and then Outback shows up and he signed the register. He signed it right there below Hammers signature. So I don't know why he thinks he's getting information from us. Outback still wants to do a ten mile section in the park and they're trying to do that tomorrow.  So we come into town and clean up and rested and went to the Millinocket Town festival. Didn't buy a thing, listened to a band and come back to the motel.  And then we had to try to figure out where to eat. Everything was packed. So we stay in and eat at Ruthies. We tell her we are leaving tomorrow. We are summiting Katahdin on the 22nd so we need to get ready for that.","Rainbow Spring campsite

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598374,"I don't know where I left off. Monday evening this would have been, Nineteenth. We left Acadia National Park.  I think we stopped at Ellsworth Maine and called Pine Ellis. Checked weather, called up Pine Ellis, and yeah they can shuttle us from East B Hill road over to Grafton Notch for thirty dollars. And they had our room available again for sixty. So we said OK we'll be there. That was a Two and a half hour drive.  We got there around seven thirty. OK. Terry took over drive and got in construction. But finally we came up to Bangor and got on the interstate.   On the way, we put in McDonald's, so it took us a little bit different way up to Andover. And that's what we had for supper, McDonalds.   So then Tuesday September twentieth. We got up at like quarter after five at Pine Ellis. And got our stuff together went down. Had coffee and muffin. And pay. And went to the store.  The driver Gloria who is a sister to Naomi who is the manager like. She says, well just go ahead, you don’t need to come back here, we will just meet out at the trailhead at seven fifteen. So that's what we did. We went to the store, bought some Breakfast sandwiches for breakfast and for lunch. Then we headed up. Parked car at East B Hill, big RV is there. Nobody in sight. And then finally Gloria came and took us over to Grafton notch. And there were, As usual, people in the parking lot at seven thirty in the morning. And some people around having coffee even. She dropped us right off at trailhead and like seven forty we were on our way. And beautiful day but it was going to be a warm one. But early start and we knew it was going to be really hard. We started walking north from Grafton Notch. Doesn’t take very long and they start taking you up pretty steeply and then they have steps that Just kept going up up up and. Two point three miles to shelter turn off, but we just sat there, because it was off trail.  Took a break and then we continued on. And we were strong, we just went right up that thing, and that was three point one mile to the top, in 2.5 hours. You know the trail wasn't bad, was fairly good for being as steep as it was. I mean it had its moments, and we were sweating pretty good. So we passed a couple of young guys coming down. We figured they stayed at the shelter overnight, didn't really talk to anybody. But then get to the top of West Baldpate, find the sign, and let’s just rest here for ten minutes. And sat down right in the trail.  This guy comes up and Starts to act like he was going to sit down. I said, no problem come sit with us. And he says oh I guess I ought to stop. He said my sons half way back down the hill; I'd better wait for him. So he sat there and he talked to us for a long time. Told us his whole story.  He’s from Southern Florida.  Near Naples or his favorite place, Big Cypress National park.  So his nickname is Big Cypress. And he's been through hiking and back in Vermont his wife just took a little fall off of a root. And went down and broke her femur, her leg and you know the whole fiasco of trying to get her out. Rescuers couldn't find them even though he told them everything from coordinates to trails. And they had to use the kids on A.T.V.'s that were running around for help till the rescue found them. And they get her down off the mountain. Into an ambulance and then from the ambulance they airlifted her to Albany. And by the end of that evening she had already had surgery and was resting. And they put a big Rod in her leg.  I said, what about insurance?  Well he's military, had some good insurance, but there was like a three thousand catastrophic coverage limit.  We asked about the helicopter ride.  THAT was fifty two thousand dollars but he doesn’t think he will be paying. Like he says, the insurance companies and whoever fights it out. But then in the meantime his son is twenty year old, took over for her and came out on the trail. Been out on the trail like three weeks.  Found out later his trail name is Animal because he runs down the hill slipping and sliding all the way.  So we ended up staying there like twenty minutes instead of 10, talking and we headed on down.  You just go down into like a little saddle to go back up onto the east peak of Baldpate. And so that wasn't too horrible. It was kind of steep down, but short. And then up the other side, was steep up but you just kept going up these ledges, like layers of slabs that you just step up, and you can walk up that way. I don't know how to explain it to you. It was steep but we got up there pretty good and sat down again. And said this time we'll just take a ten minute break because we took twenty minutes before.  Before we got down the saddle, Big Cypress and Animal had gone by us. Just so happened they caught up with us at a place where we had thrown our Poles. And animal wanted us to us his because he thought we had dropped ours. We said no, we did that on purpose. Is this the first time I ever saw, that I remember, using a rope to kind of get yourself down the slab a rock to reach a ladder, to use a ladder to go down.  We get up on the East peak of Baldpate and its too windy, so we had to set down off the peak a little bit. Things are going good. Feeling great. 4 miles, 4 hours. So then we get going again and we start down and I mean it's a steep. It's terrible, it's horrible, but we're still up on the slab part of the Baldpate. This guy comes up from the north he's going south. Thin guy but going really really slow and he stops to talk to us.  He just kept going on and on about how hard it was to get up here. And how it’s so hard for him. And he had too much food in his Pack.  He filled up for seven days out, shouldn't have done that. Pack was like thirty eight pounds. The trail back there was just horrible he says. I'd be carefully, you make sure you've got three points all the time on the ground, and you grab what you need to grab. And went on and on. Finally we said, well better get going then, you know if it's going to be that bad. And he said his trail name was Omega. And the more we went down the more we started realize what he had been talking about. It was kind of some bad stuff, slow going and slippery and steep. It's kind of on the North side, and so it's kind of looked wet. We didn’t trust it and you start trying to go around on the edge where other people tried to go. And grab on the trees. And I think you can finally sit down and slide along.  But kept going down.  I guy did pass us, and he said his trail name was Turtle. And I go Well you're going pretty fast to be a Turtle, he goes I’m a racing Turtle. So by this time I guess we're trying to get down to the second lean to, fry brook.  Just kept looking for it and finally Two thirty maybe, it pops up in the view. Very pretty setting. Turtle was there making lunch. He just got some water from the brook, making his lunch and we sit there and talked. And took our shoes off and I think we spent a half hour there. 2:50pm. Four and a half miles to go. Oh yeah you said two forty seven with four and a half miles to go. We thought OK this isn't too bad. We talked to him for quite a while.  He started like May twenty fifth and he thought he only had a couple more weeks and he'd be finishing up. Been out on the trail all but three days and that was just a Weekend when he went through Pennsylvania, where he's from, near a suburb of Philadelphia. And one day his girlfriend came out on the trail, he went off to see her.   Very few zero days and only three days off the trail. So he was interesting to talk to. So then from there we had to go back up. Five hundred feet or so. And then down 1000. By then we started feeling worn out. And you know just keep going. And they're not giving you too good of a trail. So you start complaining, we did go over the top of a hill and started down. And my God you can see the gorge you have to go down. My God if we're going to go all the way down there, we go down down down and Trails horrible and Turtle passes us.   We told him; well we hope it’s some good trail.  Then finally it did break free and for a whole mile we could make some good time. And then got steeper. And then we go, where is the bottom at?  And finally we get to the Dunn falls and 2.5 hours to do three and a half miles. And boy was it a gorge, we walked across just above it.  They said there are some falls up higher.  We go 0.8 miles to go and we knew it was going to be up hill.  First they take you up and they take you down and they take you flat, which was OK.  And you know we're just tired. We just want to see that road and the trail just goes on and on. And then finally, we cross a little brook and there are some hikers there and go up a hill and there's East B Hill road. Five fifty three pm.","Grafton Notch, Maine 26

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598375,"We headed up to Baxter State Park.  We got to Dicey Pond, Oh two thirty, and just a beautiful day for the people that summited today. They had a great day but it was on the warm side. At Dicey pond, I don’t know how many times we walked back to our cabin from the car. It was the furthest cabin, but very rustic, right on the lake. We just tried to get ourself ready for the big hike. And then we relaxed, sat out on the picnic table at the lake.  Had our pizza for supper and then we went up to the library Building and sat down on the porch. We watch people come in from canoeing and other things.  Terry made a fire at the cabin and it got Toasty. We got the door open, the window open. A propane light that doesn't give off much light. So we're using the LED light. Went outside and looked at the stars. Just unbelievable, the number of stars in the Milky Way. But now we're trying to get to bed early. Going to get up real early tomorrow, and let's hope tomorrow is a great day.Wednesday we arrived at Dicey Pond, at our cabin the Owls Nest. Let's say about two thirty in the afternoon and we talked to the ranger there. And she spent a lot of time actually talking to us. Her name Charity Lavaster. And we talk about everything from hiking Mount Katahdin, to of all things genealogy. And she went by us once at the car parking and she says that’s not the worst packed car I've seen. There are people I've seen here that have just taken everything out of the car. Can't find anything.  We tried to keep it limited to just a few items, because we were the furthest cabin on the lake.  Easily 800 ft to our cabin, we had to go by three cabins.  But very rustic, very nice. Was a two bedroom with 4 twin beds. Originally thought Abby and Jay would be along. We pushed ours together. We had a View of the Lake; view Mount Katahdin but there was a little tree in the way.  Very nice area to see Mount Katahdin.  The public building there that they call the library. It has a porch on the back side for the lake, and a view of Mt Katahdin. So when we got ready to have supper, we took our pizza, and we ate our pizza on our picnic table. Then we walked on up there to library. And sat on the porch for a while and watched couples canoeing. One guy walks out in the water with these clogs, and I don't know what he was really going to do, but he sees us and turns around and leaves.  There was one loon out on the lake, and he didn't make too much noise, just a little bit. Beautiful sunny day, nice temperature. Made my last phone call to dad as we were coming in the park. There was a high spot near Abol campground. And we just settled in for the evening. Watch the Sun Go Down.  We watched the shadows come up the mountain. And then we went on inside had a little fire going. Warmed up the place real nice. Propane lamp, A little bit to be desired. Had led headlamps if we needed more light. And we basically got ready for the big hike, and decided that we would wake up at four forty five. Set 3 alarms. My phone, Terrys watch and Terrys tablet. Needless to say, during the night I had to go out Twice, first with Terry, and we just went near the cabin, because the outhouse was up the hill. Not the best  trail. But then I went out a second time by myself, and all the stars we're absolutely beautiful to see, the Milky Way.","

Drive Thru Hikers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598436,"Thursday September twenty second, we wake up at four forty five. We don't waste any time; we get our feet ready, get our clothes on.  Pack up everything, including the sheets and the pillows. And we're out of there in a half hour, back to the car.  We drive down the road and we find a pullout, and we stop there and we have our cereal in the car.  Then we continue on to the Katahdin Stream campground day parking. And I’d say we got there right about six AM. And got ready and we were off on the trail at six fifteen. Sun was just up enough for you to walk without any lights. And we were the only; well there was one car in the parking lot. I think they were camping there and another car pulled up next right next to him. Where we were parked, and the rest of the parking lot there was nobody but us. So you walk and you actually walk down the road, where there's more camping and people can pull right up to their campsites. And there's a lot of little lean tos. And you're next to the creek. For the first mile or so the trails pretty nice. We signed in at the register. Oh my God I was surprised, I looked at the register, Oh let's say ten to fifteen people before us. The earliest one at two thirty five in the morning. And then a lot of them 4:00am and the latest was at 5:00am. But then we started hiking up and pretty easy and finally after one point one miles you come to the bridge. You go over the stream and there's a toilet. That was kind of weird I thought.  There were two elderly guys down there and we just said hello. Kept on going. The trail got steeper for us and then finally come to the falls, Katahdin stream falls, very nice falls actually. Of Course, you take a couple pictures and go on. And then after that, it starts getting harder, steeper. And then finally you say, ""how do we get past this little point"", there are places where people had made Side trails around trouble spots. So we took some of those and then finally people started passing us. Actually one guy was going down. One guy came down and then people start passing us going up and it got harder. We slowed down and we started having to do more rock climbing.  I mean, because it was too high a step to get up. A lot of these and you had to figure out how to go around it, or how to get by it. You finally find a foothold or figure out some way. Then we keep going. What can I say, mile after mile, and then finally, before tree line, was the rebar footholds and handholds. And it was very strange, they could've given us more rebar, more handles to hold on too but they didn’t. Those were a Couple very interesting spots where you had to try to use these handholds to get up. And I think we had to take off our packs to get under some rocks. Terry was trying to help push me up in some places. And then a couple places, people were behind me, I’m trying to get out of there way, to let them by. Then you know, these young kids, my God, zoom zoom zoom, they go right on up. And then there's also the fear factor comes more into play. The young, they're just going up these really steep sections, and just walking up.  And Terry and I are a little bit more leery of that. But we do it when you have to do it. So then finally you get above tree line. And then finally get up on this knob, and you look up and it was like what you could see from way off.  A knob with a little dip and then on up.  From a long way away it looks like, ""oh that's a nice trail"", Well it was a bunch of giant jumbled rocks. Finding your way around and getting on top, and walking a little ways and then,"" OK how do you get up there"", and don't always follow the blaze. Because sometimes the blaze takes you right up somewhere you can't get to.  We’re all just in there, just trying to get up there. Finally we get up there on a flat, what I call the flat. The big area you can see all the way up.  That’s where the sign is, at one point six miles to go.  I'd just be guessing, I think it was right about eleven o'clock.  We thought maybe we could get this done by noon. Thinking that it would be a great trail, and for a short time it was pretty good. And then it goes back to where you really have to kind Of Rock hop and Watch your step. Part of the hike on the flats is thru a roped off corridor to preserve and protect delicate plant life. We struggle up the last hill towards the summit. We can finally see the summit sign surrounded by hikers. We hike straight to the summit at 12:00 noon. It’s an emotional moment but anticlimactic since we have 43 miles to complete the AT. We take our pictures and sit there with 50 other people enjoying the moment. We mostly talk to a young couple from Oldtown, Maine. They try to summit every year. It a great moment with some beautiful weather. At 12:30pm we know it’s time to head down. At 1:15 we are at the steep drop-off from the flatlands, and take a final view of the vast landscape. My God, we did it.We get to the drop-off and we start down.  That’s what you can see from way off, the section of giant boulders.  We just take our time and we had plenty of time. It was only about 1:15pm.   So we felt like we had time, and just took our time. Went cautiously, people passing us. What can I say about down. It was hard but you get down. We just grind our way down. At least you're not hurting with the exertion, you're just so worried about scratching and falling, rocks are not forgiving at all. But finally get out to another point, I call home there.  When we came up, there was a big group of people sitting there. Half way up the steep. Then we continued down and you’re getting more into the boulders, and you get close to the tree line. But, you still got the technical areas to get by. And you just keep doing one spot after another. You get by one spot find the blaze. OK which way do I go from here.  We went through one place and we had to take the backpacks off.  That was a little dangerous, I thought. You had to actually slide down the chute for like three feet or more, and you got to make sure you can stop. Or you slide forty feet. And we're taking our packs off, I hand Terry his and hand him mine. And then I did the slide thing. Well   part of the problem is that overhanging rock is a little bit in your way. So you have to get by the rock, and then slide over towards that side. So I managed to do it. And then we continued on down.   Then finally we got to the last  rebar step section. We were trying to figure out how to get down and this older couple came behind us. That kind of help. You got down, and I was trying to figure out how to put my feet on the rebar step, a little bit of trouble. But I finally figured it out and got down.  We sat there and watched other hikers come down. And then Avalon came along, I said I'll get a picture of you, so I have a picture of the area.  And so I started talking to her. Terry went on down a ways.  It got less and less technical, we are down below tree line, and you could start using the trees a lot to hold on to. That made it easier. Finally we all ended up stopping to rest.  We all ended up kind of sitting at one spot, and these three guys going up come by and stop and start talking to us.  The first two guys were carrying nothing and the third guy only had a daypack. And we talked to them a little bit. We asked if they had hired one guy to carry their stuff for the day, but they said they were out for 8 days hiking in the area and they're all from Portsmouth, New Hampshire. And they wanted to hear our story about how we hiked the A T for fifteen years. And how we do our own shuttling on the Road. They told us their trail names. Why don't I have any recollection, I dont know. So we're all just excited and you know talking about how hard this trips been on us, and they were just so congratulatory also. I mean it was so nice, I told the one guy, ""thank you so much"", because for me it was a very big accomplishment. And you know part of it's my own doing, being too heavy. but I think, at my age, to do what I've done in these last two weeks, I was pretty, I was pretty happy with myself actually, even though I had several meltdowns.  Terry should be happy to. Terry says ""Cindy is amazing"". We both did it, my God. And I tell you my feet and my calves of my thighs, they feel so good right now. And it's almost kind of sad because I don't want to lose it. But anyhow it was a fantastic hike. And we kept going. After that I talked to Avalon for a while and heard her story.  She'd hiked almost two thousand miles of the trail and she wanted to summit Mt Katahdin before she left the trail.  And she was hurting but she got Katahdin done. Then by Saturday she must somehow get down to Portland and meet her mother who was flying in from Denver. Terry scratched his arms up and legs. And he was pretty banged up. So then finally we say, wow this trail really isn't as nice as we were thinking going up. You know because you have to watch your feet a little bit. It was, by then five thirty eight. We go OK let's hope we get out by six thirty. And you finally come to the falls and come to the bridge and its 5:55pm at the bridge. And we think, oh my God, we’re going to do this. But we know the daylights going to go soon. But it managed to stick around long enough, we signed out at Six twenty five P.M. I think. And then we just walked right out to the campground.  We got back to the car, got in and drove down to Millinocket. Make phone calls; got our room at the Ruthies Terrace motel, it was a different room for once, with 2 beds. We went to McDonald's for supper, brought it back to the room. Cleaned up. I was just relaxed and sleepy.  We slept in the next morning. Got up, it was raining. Went into Ruth's restaurant had breakfast. And we talked and decided that, I knew I wanted to go home and Terry was OK with that. He knew that we weren't going to get all the trails done. So we completed 78.1 AT miles in 2016 and left 42.7 miles to complete . We will be back. I said we need to just check on air flights. Somehow get up here for just a week or so and finish it off. So that’s the plan. We headed down to Portland and got the rental Car returned. For two Weeks one Day.  One more thing I'll say, congratulations to Terry and me on a great trip.","Katahdin Stream Campground
