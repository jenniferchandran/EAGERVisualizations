Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523681,"In less then 2 weeks I leave for Georgia to start my thru hike of the Appalachian trail. I am full of nervous excitement and it is starting to effect my sleeping. I still have lots of loose ends to tie up and a few more days at work. I am leaving my full time job to set off on this adventure which I know will be the ultimate challenge for me. I can not explain exactly why I am doing this and why this is the right time, but it is very clear to me that I am suppose to do this and I am suppose to do this now. Today I am heading to a local mountain near where I live. Mount Monadnock. It is a 3100 foot mountain that I hike regularly. It should be a good training mountain. I will be hiking with a 32 pound pack, which is more then what I will be taking on my thru hike. It is all about getting use to having that pack on now and getting some good training runs in. I am 47 so my approach to this trip will be carefully thought out. I am going to take it easy for the first month and then once I have adjusted I should be able to pick the pace up. I do not want to hurry by any means though. I want to enjoy this whole experience. I know I will be challenged like I never have been before and I am looking forward to all the challenges.","home

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523867,"It has been a crazy few weeks getting prepared for my thru hike. Everyday has been jammed packed with getting ready in one way or another. There is so much to get in order before I leave, plus I am getting out and doing some good training hiking. Today I took my pack out in the Quabbin. I got 3-4 miles in before a severe thunderstorm warning hit the area, so I made it a short hike.. Spent the evening preparing some food items. My brother will be serving as my base support system and we will be mailing stuff back and forth. It is actually pretty fun doing all this preparation work. It is keeping me very busy and focused. I can not wait to be on the trail. 10 days! Let the countdown begin.","

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525187,"So today was my first day on the trail. I could not have asked for a more perfect day. It started at the hiker hostel in Dahlonega. The folks there picked me up from the Marta Train Station. I road in with two other hikers, Matt and Electra. Very nice people. I can not say enough good things about this hostel. They were awesome and I met some more nice people who will be out hiking the trail also. I did not sleep well at all, but that was because I was full of nervous excitement. We had breakfast and headed to Springer Mountain. The ride was up a very winding dirt road and seemed to go on forever. It was a rough ride and all 14 of us were ready to get out of that van. We all hiked back to the beginning of the trail a mile and then started our 2189 mile journey. I hike most of the day with Jenny from Norway, Electra, and Jeff. Surprisingly we did not encounter a lot of people on the trail. It was a picture perfect day. Bright blue skies, 65 degrees, crispy clean air and beautiful mountain landscape. I was like a little kid at Christmas all day. We stopped pretty early at Hawks Shelter around 3:00pm after hiking around 9 miles. There are a lot of other hikers here as well. I would say 30-40 people. I set up my hammock, which is still a little bit of a process and got settled in. Water had to be gathered and filtered and I did some talking to other folks before finally making my supper. It is suppose the get down to the mid 30's tonight where we are. I should be fine in my hammock as it is encased in down, but it will be a good test. So that is my day. It was a perfect beginning.","Springer Mountain

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525351,"So it was another fantastic day. However last night it got down to 33 degrees. I managed to stay warm enough and got some sleep, but I would not want it much colder. Today I hiked from Hawk Mountain Shelter to Woody Gap. It was a 12+ mile day and the weather was picture perfect again with temps getting into the seventies. I hiked with several other thru hikers at times which was very enjoyable and had my first real miles alone. When I got to Woody Gap the trail magic bus was parked here and I had a clementine, which was so juicy and tasty and then they had this awesome beef and been soup. I had 2 bowls and it was late in the day so I called it dinner. I'm planning to get to Neel Gap tomorrow and probably get off the trail for Thursday. They are saying rain and storms. I am having a blast so far...","hawk shelter

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525517,"I did not sleep that good last night, but managed a few hours. I ended up camping with Aaorn from Illinois, and Garrett and Michelle from Maine. I also have been hiking on and off with them today and yesterday. Garrett and Michelle have a dog named Dexter. We have been passing each other back and forth since day one at Springer Mountain. They are super nice, as is Aaron. So last night was not as cold and I was much more comfortable. It is pretty cool listening to the wind rustle amongst all the trees while laying in my hammock. I seem to be really good at the hiking part of this, but I am struggling a bit with setting up my camp and then breaking it down in the mornings. I know it will get better the more I do it. I can not wait until I am more proficient at it. Today it took me an hour to get out of my hammock, make a breakfast shake and take down my camp and get it all in my pack. I was off at 8:30am. I hiked to the top of Big Cedar Mountain, which only took a half hour or so. The views were awesome so I stopped and made a cup of coffee and let the morning sun warmth beat on my face. It was really nice and relaxing. The rest of the day I hiked on and off with Aaron, Garrett and Michelle, but eventually I got ahead of them and spent the second half of the day hiking by myself. It was another perfect weather day. Sunny and in the high 60's. Today was Blood Mountain day, which is 4457 feet tall and biggest hardest accent so far. I made great time today and made it up and over without a hitch. The views from the top were awesome and the best from the first 3 days of hiking. I took lunch at the top before heading down two in a half miles to Neel Gap. I did the whole eleven miles in a little over six hours. I passed Patriot on the way down. He stayed at the same hostel on our first night before we set out on this adventure. He is a very nice guy, as is everyone else who I have met out here. They are saying rain tomorrow and heavy rain and storms tomorrow night so I made the call to come into Blairsville and get a room. I will take tomorrow off before getting back at it on Friday. They call this a zero day. I have a hard time setting up camp in perfect weather. I can not imagine doing it in the pouring rain. I know that time will come soon enough, but I am putting it off for this storm and rain event. It has been just an amazing 3 days of hiking. The trails are much more forgiving then my home mountain of Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire or any of the White Mountains which I hike every year. It is a lot of hard packed flat dirt that goes up and down. I know it will get tougher soon enough, but I am loving hiking on these trails.","Woody gap

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525689,"Today is a day off the trail. Myself and many others have gone into town because of the storms in the forecast for today and overnight. When I arrived at neel gap the man working convinced me to hitch hike into the town of Blairsville rather then call for a shuttle. He said it was easy and would not take long. I was skeptical. He even told me where to stand by the road in front of the establishment. Sure enough he was right. The second car that went by picked me up. The 2 folks that picked me up and were very nice. There names are Rob and Debbie Morgan from the nearby town of Suches Georgia. Funny thing is it was the first time I had ever hitch hiked and the first time they had ever picked up a hitch hiker. A big thank you to them for helping me out. They recommended a pizza joint to eat at and I need to thank them for that too. I ate at a place called Sicilies. It was one of the best pizza's I have ever had. I had a a great waitress whose name was Holly. Everyone is so nice and friendly down here. I love it! So this afternoon I did some shopping for re supplies and did my laundry. Spent some time talking to other hikers. There are at least a dozen of us here maybe more. All of us would rather be on the trail, but strong storm on the mountain and hikers do not go very well together. I think everyone is planning on getting back on the trail tomorrow. I just loaded a bunch of pics on here, so check out the photo page if interested.","Neel gap

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525972,"So I got back on the trail this morning after a zero day yesterday. Last night I shared my room with D3 who I have seen a few times on the trail. They had three guys in his room and he was going to have to sleep on the floor. I had two beds in my room so I told him he could have it and he took it. He is a nice guy. He lives in Roanoke and I believe he is only going to be on the trail for a few months. I ended up getting out the door at 8:30am and it took me about two minutes to hitch a ride back to Neel Gap. There is an outfitters store there where everything is way over priced, but it is nice stuff. I picked up a pack cover and a little food before heading out on the trail at about 9:30am. The first hour was foggy and then it burned off. It was a great day for hiking. There was some good humidity in the air and it got up in the seventies. It stayed mostly cloudy, but it was pleasant. I love the way the humid air feels on my skin, especially after a New England winter where the dryness just sucks all the moisture out of you. I set a good pace in the morning making good time. I hit the first shelter, Whitley Gap Shelter at 1:00pm and then I hit the 2nd shelter, Low Gap Shelter at 3:00pm. I was feeling good so I decided to press on and see if I could make the next shelter, Blue Moon Shelter, which is at 3880 feet. At about 5:00pm my feet really started to get tired and I had a blister on my right little toe. I pressed on, but my pace had slowed. I hiked mostly solo today, however I did run into Aaron again. We passed each other a few times and I eventually got ahead of him for good. Later on I was passed on the trail by Moose. He stayed at the same motel as I did the prior night and we spent some time talking there, so it was good to see him. I hiked with him for a short time, but it was later in the day and my feet were sore so he eventually got ahead of me. Just before 7:00pm I made it to Blue Moon Shelter and boy was I glad to see it. I struggled to set up my camp and then I made my dinner. After I ate I realized I had to readjust my hammock and tarp and it was dark now. It stunk but eventually I got it right. I am tired and hope I can get a good night sleep tonight. I have some bigger ups and downs tomorrow. I ended up hiking 18.8 miles today. I think I over did it. Tomorrow should be shorter miles.","Blairsville

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526167,"Today started like all my other mornings in camp. Me fumbling around taking down my hammock and tarp. Then getting everything to fit in my place in an orderly manner. I take my vitamins and make my breakfast shake and then I hit the trail. This should take maybe a half hour. It takes me well over an hour. I can not wait until I figure out camp life better. My hammock is very comfortable and I have had no back aches. It is just getting the darn thing set up and taken down. It is awful. It also turns out I have 2 blisters on my right foot. I drained them and put some mole skin on them. I had a plan to get half way to Hiawassee and the do the other half tomorrow. However when I checked the weather it said temps would get below freezing tonight. So I left it open to do all 19 miles today if it would work out. If I was not so bad at camp life right now it might not be quite as much of a problem. I am also expecting some more warm gear to arrive Monday. I left Blue Moon Shelter at 8:30am. Most everyone else had already left. I felt great as I headed north. It was a very sunny clear crisp morning. It was beautiful out. There were a lot more ups and downs on the map today starting with Rocky Mountain. With the summit at 4017 feet it offered awesome views. I caught up with Patriot again at this point. It is the second time I have caught him. He will probably pass me again tomorrow and then I will re catch him. As I came up on the second large mountain of the day at Tray Gap there was a big set up ahead and it was a big trail magic event. The Boy Scout Troop 24 out of Cornila were set up and serving a ton of food for all the hikers. I had a chicken breast burger with this awesome black bean pasta salad. It was so good. So a big thank you to all those folks. I then headed up Tray Mountain. It was about a 1400 foot accent to the peak, which stood at 4430 feet high. The views were incredible again. I was feeling great and taking it all in. I had done about 8 miles at this point and the next 7 mile were much easier to get to Deer Gap Shelter. As I moved across the landscape the wind continually picked up all afternoon and by mid afternoon it was sustained around 20-30 mph. In my head I was thinking temps in the high 20's and winds of 20-30mph. I wasn't felling up for that. I arrived at Deer Gap Shelter at 4:30pm. My feet were fatigued and telling me they were done. I had hiked 15.5 miles to this point. I walked the .3 miles down hill to the shelter. Filtered and filled my water bottles. I found a spot to set up my hammock. The shelter area was actually on the side of the mountain where is was protected from the big winds. I took everything out of my pack, but decided to eat some food before doing anything else. When I finished I checked my maps. It was only 3.6 miles to Dicks Creek, which is the road that goes into Hiawassee. Everything was telling me to get into town. I had plenty of time even if I went slow. So I went with my gut and repacked my bags hiked back up to the trail and headed out all fueled up for one final push. The terrain was not bad, but I did take it easy because my feet hurt. I got to the gap around 6:30pm. I took my pack off put it in front on my and used my newly learned hitch hiking technique. The 3rd car picked me up. A very nice guy named Tim from Murphy NC. Thank you Tim. I had him drop me off at the Budget Inn. There sign out front said there were vacancies. However once I went to get a room I was told they were full. Turns out there are multiple events going on in the area. I then put my pack on and walked at least 3/4 of a mile to a Holiday Inn Express and got their last room. I dropped my pack in my room and went to the steak house across the street and had dinner. Now I am in my room, nice and warm and comfortable. So I think I hiked 19.1 miles today after 18.8 yesterday. Tomorrow is a day off as I have several packages arriving in this town for Monday. I will pick them up and get back on the trail Monday.","Blue moon shelter

I need to pick up a mail drop tomorrow morning and then I should be back on the trail at Dicks Gap by 10:00am. I am doing laundry and going through my pack today. I am sending a few items back home. I am expecting to be on the trail for the next seventy miles without coming to town. I am going to take six days worth of food, which means my pack will probably be around 35lbs. It is suppose to be nice weather this week, but cold at night. I am excited to get back out there, especially now that I have more cold weather gear for sleeping. I have loved Georgia and all the nice people I have met. I mean the state motto is ""In God we trust"" and it is on all the license plates as well. It is awesome. I met a fellow a few days ago and he use to live in New England and he said living here is like in New England, except you do not have winter and the people are nice. He said he would never go back. I will reach North Carolina tomorrow. The mountains will be bigger and the terrain a little tougher. I should be in the Smokies in a few weeks. I just thank God I am here and am doing this. It is pretty awesome.","Dicks Creek Gap

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526588,"Monday April 4th entry. No cell coverage where I was last night. The day started in Hiawassee. I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express last night. I ran down to the post office at 8:30am to grab a few packages I had mailed to me. I then checked out and took a shuttle ride 10 miles back to the trail head where I had left off. I started my hiking at 10:00am from Dicks Creek Gap. My two blisters are still hurting and I have taped them and treated them but it made for slow going in the morning. I stopped several times to re adjust the tape and gel things that I was using. Finally I took two Aleeve tablets and put a piece of soft foam under my little toe and that seemed to help. Ok, enough whining. It was a gorgeous day. Temps in the mid seventies with light winds and bright blue skies. I hit the first shelter around noon and stopped there took my shoes off and had lunch. Another guy who I had been passing back and forth through the morning also stopped and ate with my. His name is Stephon. He,has been given the trail name Hollywood and he thinks he is going to keep it. He was a real nice guy. After lunch I pushed on. I hit a mile stone at mile number nine for the day. I crossed into North Carolina, which is 78.5 miles into my journey. Thank you Georgia. You were awesome and hello North Carolina here I come. Almost immediately the terrain seemed to change. You can tell a lot of people must quit by this point because the trails are not nearly as worn down. There are still leaves on the trail, which there were not in Georgia because of the high amount of foot traffic. The afternoon had some good ups and downs and I got some amazing views from Courthouse Bald at over 4700 feet. It was awesome. I preaty much stayed above 4000 feet throughout the afternoon and because their still is no foliage on the trees high up in the mountains I was treated to awesome views all day. It will be a lot different in a week or so when there is foliage on all the trees. I like it now. Everything is so bright and you can see forever in all directions. I hiked way too long again, but I really like hiking in the evening. I finally stopped a little after 7:00pm at Deep Gap. I hiked about 15 miles today. It was a great day. It's suppose to be cold tonight, but I'm feeling warm as a lay in my hammock and say good night.","Dicks Creek Gap

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526591,"Last night was preaty cold and extremely windy. I did manage to get some decent sleep through it though. I had to put my ear plugs in at 3:00 am because the wind was so loud. It was freezing at 7:30am when I got up. The first thing I had to do was dress up my blisters so I could get my socks on. After that I pulled down my bear bag and ate a hunny bun for a quick breakfast. It was too cold for anything else. I then started disassembling my camp and then I filtered some water and got headed up Standing Indian Mountain. It stands at 5435 feet tall. It was a very moderate climb though with a lot of switchbacks. The views from the top were nice. Once I got up there I was glad to feel the sun as I had camped on the side of the mountain with no morning sun. It turned out to be another fantastic day. Probably around 70 degrees and full sunshine. It was a great day. I was slowed a bit by the blisters on my feet and made several stops to adjust my wraps. I finally got it so it felt pretty good. The decent off Standing Indian was also very gradual and not difficult. I passed by several shelters and said hi so other hikers, but most of the day I hiked solo as I have for the last few days. People are starting to get more spread out. I ran into a few hikers near the end of the day where I thought I would camp. That place was Betty Creek Gap. In the AWOL book it has it as a marked camping spot, but upon arrival there were four other tired folks there wanting to camp as well. The problem was it has been marked as a no camping area. So we all headed on down the trail. I ended up a mile or so up the trail at Mooney Gap with a few other people. The women right next to me named V, took in a stray dog while hiking a few days back on Tray mountain. She names him Tray and brought him to the vet in town and is having it brought back to her home in NH. Her mother is coming here to get the dog in two days. It is pretty cool. So I am very tired and in my hammock. It is supposed to be cold again tonight, but this weekend it is really suppose to get super cold. They are saying low 20's. I am thinking about going to visit my sister and her family in Holly Spings for a few days and then get back in the trail after this cold snap. I will be in Fraklin tomorrow and will figure it out then.","Deep Gap

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526748,"Today is the 10th day into my adventure. I have spent six full days hiking, two half days hiking, and two zero days. I have totaled 106.1 miles. I have learned a lot. I have made mistakes. I have had some amazing days hiking and I have a much better understanding for what lies ahead. I am going by the rules of being a thru hiker. One big rule is, hike your own hike, not someone else's. With that being said I made the decision today to go visit my sister and her family in Holly Springs NOrth Carolina through this weekend. The weather is calling for bitterly low temp possibly getting into the teens. That is too cold for my current sleeping set up. I have been very cold the last two nights, with temps last night dropping below freezing and with high winds it is not something I enjoyed at all, so I am not going to suffer through it because I don't have too. This will also give my blisters on my right foot a chance to heel up a bit before I get back at it early next week. I am also having a full size underquilt sent to me which should help keep me much warmer at night in my hammock. All that being said today started out with a 3:00am wake up call with winds whipping and temps dropping to below freezing. I slept from about 10:00pm until 3:00am. After that I was too cold. I thought about getting up around 6:00am, but it was still dark and I had someone camped right next to me and that would have woken them up for sure. So I waited until sunrise, which was a little after 7:00am. I got up, dressed my feet, got my bear bag out of the tree and then started breaking down my camp. My finger tip were frozen numb. I hate that. My water was partially froze, my cheese was froze. I did not eat any breakfast. Before I left one of the other fellas camping in the same location had started a fire. I forget his name. I am so bad with names unless I right them down. Anyways, I chatted and warmed up for a few minutes by the fire and then I left camp headed up hill. My feet were bothering me, but not going uphill, only going downhill. V had left right after me and quickly passed me with her new dog Tray. As we approached the summit the climb got very steep and I passed her back. I reached the summit of Albert Mountain at about 9:00am and V was there shortly after. Albert Mountian is 5250 feet tall and marks the 100 mile mark on the trail and has a fire tower that rises above tree level. The views were spectacular. V came up and I took a selfie with her marking the occasion. Upon leaving the summit and going down I was slowed by the pain in my feet so she got ahead and I did not see her again. I hiked 7.7 miles from 8:15am until 12:15 am until I reached Rock Gap. From there I took a $3:00 shuttle ride into Franklin and got dropped off at a enterprise car rental. I had to wait two hour to get a car. I killed the time by getting lunch at this awesome gazebo cafe place. When I got back to enterprise my car was ready and I started the 4 1/2 hour drive to my sisters. The drive was nice and relaxing, especially because my shoes were off the whole time. I got to the house around 7:00pm. We had barbecue chicken, corn on the cob and french fries. After dinner Doug, who is my sisters husband, and Abby, my niece, went and got some frozen yogurt. All good stuff. We got back the house and watched some of the US women's soccer game and now I am in bed. A warm bed. I should sleep very well tonight. My eyes are ready to shut as soon as I am done with this. I will start this journal back up when I get back on the trail early next week and I just want to say thanks to everyone who has signed it. It's nice to hear form you all. Good night.","Mooney Gap

I can not thank them all enough for there hospitality. I had a great time and was able to let my blisters heal and also avoid the major cold front that moved through the mountains. I brought the car I rented back to Enterprise in Franklin after a five hour drive. I then took a shuttle back to where I left off the trail at Rock Gap. I have some more cold weather gear and some different footwear. I also plan on taking it a bit slower. I do not think I will be doing 18 and 19 mile days for a while. I would like to stay between 10-15 miles per day for the time being. So I got dropped off at Rock Gap at 12:30pm. The weather was awesome. Sixty degrees and partly sunny. The fresh rain from the night before seemed to clear all the junk out of the air. It was so refreshing. I made the almost four mile hike to Winding Stair Gap in a couple of hours. I took a break there and filtered some water. There was some other hikers there headed into town. I talked with them a bit before I moved on up the trail. I did not run into a lot of people today. The hiking was not too hard, but it was beautiful with views everywhere because the leaves still are not on the trees at this elevation. I hiked around 4000 feet and higher today. I reached Silver Bald mountain at 5:00pm. The summit was off the trail and straight up for several tenths of a mile. You could tell the views would be awesome from up there so up I went and as expected it was awesome. The best views so far. I stayed at the top until 6:00pm then decided to make and have my dinner up there. Silver Bald summit is over 5200 feet tall. All you can see in every direction just mountains upon mountains. I finally finished up with my dinner and got packed back up. I had to figure out where to camp. On my way down I noticed a spot over to the side of the trail that looked perfect for my hammock set up. As I was checking it out a group of hikers were coming up to check out the summit. I asked them about the shelter down below and they said it was all buggy and not very appealing. They were going to spend the night on top of Silver Bald. So I decided to stay up here as well. I set up my camp and then headed back up to the summit to watch the sun set. There were about a dozen of us there, notably Chuckles and Thin Mint. It was awesome. Everyone was nice as usual. After sunset I headed back to my camp area and called it a night. It's good to be back on the trail.","Rock Gap

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527801,"Last night was the warmest I have been. The full under quilt my brother sent me and figuring out how to properly attach it made all the difference. I awoke this morning to see the sunrise while laying in my hammock. I am so glad I stayed on top of the mountain last night. It was nice to get up and have the whole area all to myself. I took my time and enjoyed the morning and did not worry about getting going on the trail. I liked it. I ate breakfast and I sat in the sun. There is nothing like the morning sun right in your face. I slowly took down my camp and packed my stuff up and the headed out around 9:00am. It was a very sunny nice morning, but in the afternoon it became mostly cloudy, but no rain and great hiking weather. It was strange today because I did not run into any other thru hikers until right before I stopped for the day. It is interesting the dynamic out here. There are several different types of thru hikers. Let me go though them. You have single people who seem to group up and they stay somewhat together. You have actual groups of friends. You have couples, and then you have the loners. People who come here by themselves and do not group up, but do there own thing. This would be me. Kind of just like how I am back home. The thing I like about being out here is that nobody judges you and no matter how you hike the trail. There is a connection between all of us. It is like there is a hikers code, and the code is to be nice, be giving, be helpful, be encouraging. It is pretty awesome. It is also interesting how there are so many different personality types out here. You name it, it is here. There are people from all different walks of life. It is so cool. I do hope to become more social and just like at home I do way better in small groups then large ones, maybe that is why I am not staying at the shelters much. I am loving being by myself right now. I spend a lot of time with God. Time thinking about a lot of very personal things. I thank God for this fresh mountain air that is for sure. It is the best. I guess I am off track a bit here, but this is my journal and this is what I am thinking. So back to the hike today. I spent the morning hiking six miles with several good ups and downs to get over to Wayah Bald Mountain. When I reach the mountain there was a parking area with trail magic set up. This nice man had all kinds of things for the thru hikes coming by. I had a hard boiled egg, a banana, a couple of cinnamon rolls, and a gatorade. After getting some of the trail magic I walked around the parking lot looking at the views. I checked my email and made a few calls. Eventually I headed down the trail, but I did not get far when I came upon an old rebuilt tower structure. The views were awesome looking down the valley and it was just one mountain range after another. I took some pictures, but it is just not even close to the same as seeing it with your own eyes. I spent about 15 minutes there and then headed down the trail. The afternoon was nice and peaceful. The woods are beautiful. And the birds were singing up a storm. I am finally starting to see some buds on some of the vegetation. It will not be long and I will be in the green tunnel. I had four good climbs today. I came up to Cold Spring Shelter at 4:00pm. I filtered some water and was going to stay, but I thought I would go the three tenths of of mile to the top of the mountain where my guide book says there are views and see if I could find a nice spot up there to make camp. I walked and walked but never saw any great view. I probably walked a half a mile and then I was too far past the shelter to go back. I walked on for a few more miles until I found I nice little spot up on a ridge. It was perfect for my hammock set up. It was 5:15pm and I hiked about 13 miles. So this is my spot for the night. I am all alone again. When I make camp the first thing I like to do is find a place to hang my food. It can take me a bit of time to find the right branch and then get my rope over it. I eventually get my rope over it and have it all set up so when I am ready to hang my food it is all set up and only takes just a second to raise it up into the trees. After I do that, I empty my pack and set up my hammock and tarp. Then I make dinner. Then I get all my food for tomorrow ready to go. Then brush my teeth. Then hang my food and other stuff. Then organize my bag. Then into bed and here I am. It was another good day. It feels so good to be warm. Good night.","Silver Bald summit

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527959,"Started the day with another sunrise. I took my time getting up and doing what is becoming the daily morning chores. Get hanging food bag, clean up, get dressed, make breakfast, breakdown came, brush and floss my teeth and taking in where I am while doing it all. I am getting better everyday at camp and that is making things even better. I started today hiking from somewhere on Rocky Bald ridge. The day started with a never ending set up small ups and downs. I knew I had a big down at some point. Right before the big decent happened I came to Wesser Bald and it had an observation tower you could go up. So up I went. I have been checking out all the views even if they are off the trail a bit. I just can not get enough of these mountains. The views were phenomenal from a top the tower. I met a few nice hikers there and then and finally I got headed down to the NOC. I dropped down about 2500 feet to get onto the NOC at 2:30pm. It was kind of crazy. People everywhere, cars everywhere, noise everywhere. Very commercialized. It was also very warm down there. I would say at least seventy five degrees and on the humid side. There were options to stay there but I was not feeling it. I needed two days of food, which I bought and then I headed back up into the wilderness and when I say up, I mean up and up and up and up. I left the NOC at 3:00pm without a real plan other then to get out of that craziness. I ended up going another 6.7 miles all up hill and some of the steepest and longest uphills by far so far. I finally stopped and camped at the very top of Swim Bald. It ended up being about a 3000 foot accent and boy did it kick my butt. I ended up doing 16.5 miles total today. I set up camp around 7:00pm and started the evening routine. Set up hang bag, set up hammock and tarp, make dinner, organize food for the next day, brush and floss teeth, clean myself, hang bear bag, get in my hammock, write my journal entry, pray, and then go to sleep. I know I will sleep good tonight.","Rocky Bald on the ridge

I went and got my food and then got back in my sleeping bag and proceeded to make coffee and a hot breakfest from inside my hammock. Had everything next to me outside. It was sweet. Hot coffee in my hammock as I watched the sun rising. My most common saying while I have been on this trip is ""you have got to be kidding me"" because there is so much beauty everywhere. I really spent a lot of time in camp before I started packing up. I have been spending 15 minutes or so just getting my feet ready. Your feet are everything out here. I stopped 3 or 4 times in the morning to address some hot spots. No more ignoring potential blisters. I was pretty sluggish once I did get going. I do not even know what time it was because my battery is very low on my phone so I kept it off much of the day. I would guess it was around 10:00am. I over did it the day before and was feeling it. I hiked a mile to Sassafras Shelter. I needed water, but the first thing I did was stretch out then I got my water. I have been carrying only a half liter of water and drinking a liter when I am at the water source. My pack is too heavy and there is water everywhere. I do not see the need to carry it if I do not have too. It has been working good so far. Moose told me he has had good luck using this method so that is where I got this idea, so thanks Moose. He is probably through the Smokies by now. So back to todays hike. I ran into some beautiful views at Cheoah Bald, another ""you've got to be kidding me"" moment. I did not make very good time though the first 4 hours of the day. At about 2:30pm I stopped and ate lunch and my feet were feeling tired. I took a couple of aleeve and after that I felt a lot better. I also had been eating quite a bit through the day and I think that helped my afternoon hiking. I made much better time later in the day. There was one really hard steep climb. It was called ""Jacobs Ladder"" It was tough. The hiking the last few days is more what I am use to in the northeast. It is much more difficult then Georgia. I feel like I am really hiking now. The trails in Georgia were 3-4 feet wide, now they are closer to a foot wide. You could really see the leaves starting to come out in places today and the temps were warm. I drank 4 1/2 liters of water today. I messed up my mileage yesterday. I gave myself an extra .9 miles. I will subtract that from todays total so It will be accurate. I stopped hiking around 6:00pm at Cody Gap after 11.9 miles. There are a bunch of other nice people camping here also. Tomorrow I will be in Fontana. It should be another good night.","Swim Bald summit

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528261,"Last night I could not get to sleep until very late. The wind was blowing like crazy and my tarp lines were rubbing against my hammock lines making an annoying noise. I got out to fix it, but I would pretty much have to take it all down. It was dark and late and all the others in the camp area were asleep so I just left it. I finally got to sleep sometime after midnight. I woke up as soon as it starts to get light out, which is around 6:30am. I watched the sunrise for the 4th morning in a row. I got up around 8:00am. I had a quick breakfast and was packed and headed out of camp by 9:00am. It was another great day with full sun and warmth. It's starting to get a lot warmer. I did not get any open unobstructed views, but the changing landscape is beautiful in and of itself. I can not get enough of the clean crisp mountain air. I ran into a lot more people today. I am so bad with names, but as usual everyone was super nice. I made great time today hiking 9.9 miles in 5 hours and I stopped several times for breaks. I got to the road crossing in Fontana around 1:30pm. I was excited because my phone was dead and I saw there were open outlets by the soda machines. 6 open ones to be exact. Wouldn't you know it none of them worked. I was irritated as I had unpacked my whole bag to get my cords out. One of the ladies standing there said they had solar powered charging stations at the Fontana Shelter which was another mile ahead. I quickly repacked and headed towards the shelter which was my destination anyways. The elevation was much lower now and it was pretty warm out. I made quick work of the last mile and arrived at the shelter around 2:00pm. I hooked up to the solar charging units but it would not work with my phone. I ran into a nice guy named T-Rex. I was setting up my hammock and he asked if he could use one of the trees I was using and hang his hammock in the other direction. I said sure. I spent much of the afternoon in his company. He seems like a really good guy. He let me use his solar charger to charge my phone, which was really nice. We then took a shuttle into Fontana to get some real food. The shuttle took 1 1/2 hours to pick us up. They were having radio problems. So we went to the general store. They did not have that much. I did get some Vitamin Milk and Raisin Bran and Frosted Flakes. I also got a bunch of junk. I have been on trail for 5 days in a row so I just wanted something different then what I had been eating. We came back to camp and ate got cleaned up. I forgot to mention this shelter is considered the best shelter on the AT. It is called the Fontana Hilton. It has bathrooms and showers. The shelter itself is right on the lakes edge with a huge patio type area. It holds around 20 hikers inside, plus there is a ton of tent and hammock areas. There must be 30 plus people here tonight. Wokman is here. I have crossed paths with him 4-5 times now. I like Him. We both have landscaping backgrounds and of course the love of the outdoors. I also ran into Gravey Train. I met him in Hiawassee. I had some extra food when we were both staying at the Holiday Inn Express and I gave it to him. Another nice guy. I took a shower for the first time in 5 days. It felt so good. So today was a good day. It was a much more social day for me. I am suppose to be taking tomorrow off and staying in town, but I kind of wish I wasn't. I was told Electra and Jenn from Norway left this shelter this morning. I would love to catch up to them and see how they are doing. It is probably a good idea to take a day to rest my body though. I seem to go pretty hard and I know I am hard on my body. I need to take care of it and give it rest, especially in this beginning part. My feet are still bothering me a bit, plus it would be hard for me to pick up my mail drop of 5 days worth of food and get repacked an head back out on the trail. The Smokies start in a mile from here. That will be very challenging for me on several fronts. You are required to stay in the shelters unless they are full. I do not have a sleeping pad so if I have to sleep in a shelter it will not be pleasant. My hammock is the best thing ever!! The other part about the Smokies that will be a challenge is that there is not a lot of water sources so I am going to have to carry a lot more water then I am use too. My pack will probably be 35 plus pounds, which is not good. The whole thing will be a big challenge. I think it stretches for almost 80 miles. So we will see what tomorrow brings. Tonight is awesome. I am all set up right next to a lake breathing in clean crisps outside air. It is a ""you've got to be kidding me kind of night.","Cody Gap

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528358,"I very reluctantly took a zero day today. I made a reservation at this lodge a few days ago. I ended up getting here yesterday, which was a day early. I had a great night at the Fontana Shelter last night. Best night of sleep in years. I was up a daylight as usual. I hung out with T-Rex as he got ready to hike out. I am done making reservations. I guess I had to learn the hard way as people have said do not make definitive plans because things change very fast out here. I never seem to be where I think I will be. I am either a day early or a day late. I took the shuttle to the lodge at 9:00am. I did my laundry at the laundry area. I found an open outlet so I started to charge my phone while my laundry was going. It is a picture perfect day today and it is killing me to be here. At one point I thought I would just get my laundry done, charge all my devices, get my resupply of food, pack everything up and get back on the trail today. I was being very impatient and had to tell myself to stop and relax. I have other things I need to do also, so I finally decide to stay and head out first thing in the morning. I am now at the grill having lunch. I just had a delicious chicken taco salad loaded with black beans! It was so good. I am also watching the nascar race at Bristol. I added a few photos. It is kind of a pain to put photos on here. You have to first download them to a different site and then upload them to my page, but I will try to add some as I go. The other thing is pictures really do what I am seeing a total injustice. To see this with your own eyes is the only true way to see this in all its beauty. Just a little note on the day to day ups and downs. I do have both. I am still a little slowed with minor feet issues. I can not wait until they are all resolved. I like to do big days and I am definitely not going full speed yet. My eating habits obviously has changed. I miss my food and my body is adjusting to all the changes. So it is into the Smoky Mountains tomorrow. My pack will be about 40lbs with 5 days worth of food. It way more then I have been carrying. Before I sign off for today I just want to give a big thank you to Patches who has thru hiked both the AT and PCT in the last few years. She has given me valuable advice on all aspects of doing this thru hike. Patches father Ken also directed me to hiking in the White Mountains when I first got serious with my hiking. He said go to Franconia Notch and do the loop trail up to Mount Lafayette and walk the ridge. After that I was hooked and have been hiking regularly ever since. It just happens the ridge part of that hike is part of the AT. I am looking forward to that and all of the Whites. So anyways thank you Patches and Ken. I am just going to head to my room now and rest and relax until tomorrow. Life is good. God is great..","Fonatan Shelter (The Fontana Hilton)

I could not sleep as I was excited to get back on the trail and into the Smokies. The Shuttle was packed and I got dropped off at the Fontana Shelter. I got to cross the famous Fontana Dam just before 9:00am. It was a drop dead gourgous morning. After the dam crossing it was into the Smoky Mountains. It was a long 4 plus mile uphill hike with my pack that weighed around 40 pounds as it was loaded with 5 days of food and 2 liters of water. I am going to try to only carry 2-3 days worth of food from now on. It is just too heavy. The uphill climb was uneventful and I finally reached the fire tower. I was excited to go up and see the 360 degree view. It was around 11:00am. and the views did not disappoint. I was surprised that other hikers were bypassing it. Several people who I was hiking near all passed on it. It was a little more uphill and just off the AT, but no more then a tenth of a mile. I still can not get enough of that stuff. After that I pushed on past the first campground. Then as in continued the forest became covered in these small white ground cover flowers. It was a neat contrast to the forest. There was lots of moss covering the trees and green grass starting to come through along with the brown leaves. The whole thing was pretty cool and it went on for a long time. I then stopped at the first shelter for lunch. I talked with some other hikers about where they were headed. It seems everyone was headed for the third shelter. I then continued up the trail and the second shelter was just a 3 mile hike. I stopped for a break there again before pushing on for the final 3 miles to the shelter I am at now. It's the Spence Field Shelter. We are sitting at 4916 feet. In the smokies you have to stay at the shelters and unless the shelter is full and you are required to stay in them. Tonight there are a lot of people here so I was able to set up my hammock thankfully. Today was a really hot day around 85 degrees and tonight is suppose to stay around 50 with calm winds. I am not setting up my tarp over my hammock and right now as I right this I am looking straight up into the stars and moon. It is pretty cool. My right leg started bothering me on my shin this afternoon. Hope it feels better in the morning as my left one is finally 100 percent. It seems as soon as I get one thing under control something else pops up.

When I fell asleep last night the moon was out and bright. It was amazing to wake up with all those stars right above. I took my time getting up as I knew I would be taking it easier today. I was a little worried when I went to bed because my shin was hurting. When I got up I put a KT tape wrap on it and then put a compression tube on it as well just for good measure I then put a thin piece of duck tape around the top and bottom of where the pain was. I left the shelter at 8:30 am and was one of the last to leave. I went very slowly and was very happy that my shin felt pretty good. As the day went on it was not an issue at all and caused me no discomfort. I feel like a dodged a bullet. I am pretty sure I was just was carrying too much weight the day before and it was a long hard hike up into the Smokies. Today I did not carry much water. I also ate a lot of food so my pack was a good 5 pounds lighter today. I think my limit is about 35 pounds, with 30 being optimal. Today I took a break every 2 hours and made myself sit down and eat. The landscape was nice with more of the white flowers covering the ground. There were also purple Violets and small yellow flowers mixed in as well. I got into Double Spring Gap Shelter around 5:00pm. There were quite a few people here so I set up my hammock and made dinner, cleaned up and got in my hammock a little early. It feels good. It is loud here tonight because there are so many people. I will be glad to be out of the Smokies so I can camp where I want. The shelters here are nice and the hiking is beautiful, but everyone is packed together. Tomorrow I will go over 200 miles and make it to Clingermans Dome, which at 6667 feet is the highest point on the AT. It is supposed to be a cloudy day, which stinks, but no rain.

It was so load it woke me up even though I was wearing ear plugs. I pushed my earplugs in my ear as far as I could and then went back to sleep. It really startled me because we are in major Bear territory and I thought it was a bear outside my tent at first. When I did finally get up it was just starting to get light. I wanted to get out of camp early. I went to make my breakfast drink and accidentally put my end of the day electrolyte drink in instead. There was nothing I could do so I drank it. I then make my breakfast drink and drank that too. I also ate some camp cereal and half a greenbelly bar. I left Double Springs Gap Shelter at 8:10 am. I was feeling really good and made my way up the Clingerman Dome. The hike up though the woods was so good. It reminded me of some of my hikes in the White Mountains. There were lots of Hemlocks and the smells were awesome. The landscape and views were awesome all day today. It started out cloudy but then became mostly sunny by noon time. After a quick visit to the Clingerman Dome observation deck I made great time as I headed towards Newfound Gap. I stopped at a parking area and sat with another hiker whos name eludes me. He was an older man who has already through hiked and was doing it again. I had to go up a steep incline and back down a steep decent to get to Newfound Gap. He was going to try to get a ride over to the Gap, but I want to do the whole trail so I marched into the woods and up the hill. I again made good time and made to the Gap by 1:00pm. There were tons of cars and tourist there and I quickly re entered the trail. It was a pretty long accent up out of the Gap and there were a lot of day hikers on the trail. I again flew up the hill and at one point I noticed another hiker coming up behind me. I picked up my pace even more and we both tore up the mountain. As we got to the top I stopped and he said loudly ""Hey Dex!"" it was Gigglles who I had met several times before I got off the trail for 5 days in Franklin. We talked for a few minutes and then both headed up for lunch at the top with a few other hikers. I really had a lot of energy and wondered if maybe it was because I had an electrolyte recovery drink in the morning. Maybe I will try that again and see if I have the same kind of day. The afternoon was more of the same and the weather was perfect. I ridge walked all afternoon with spectacular views. It was the best day of hiking I have had so far. My feet and legs are feeling better. I ran into Chuckles who I have now seen and talked to at least 6 times and Chicken Fry and another guy who's name is eluding me. I need to get better with names. I finally got to the Pecks Corner Shelter at 5:35pm. I had just completed my first 20 mile day, 20.6 to be exact and then .5 sideways miles down to the shelter. I was tired and I quickly found a spot and began the process of setting up my hammock. Then I went to the shelter and made my dinner and wouldn't you know who was there. It was Jen from Norway. We had both stayed at the same hostal the night before we started our thru hike expedition. We then hiked quite a bit together along with Elektra for the first few days. She said Elektra was a few days ahead now. It was so cool to talk and catch up with her. Another strange thing happened when I was going up to the Privy. This young lady named Vino had a little fire going and as I walked by it to use the privy a little bomb exploded in the middle of the fire. It scared the daylights out of me. She was making the fire so she could bake a potato. When I finished using the privy and walked back by she said it was her lighter that exploded. Apparently she left it too close to the fire. She did not have another lighter so I gave her the one I always keep on me. I have another one with my cook set so essentially it was an extra. She was really nice and I ate my dinner with her and Jen. After that I headed off to bed. I should sleep good today. Only a few more days and I will be out of the beautiful Smokies.","Double Spring Gap Shelter

I was feeling the effects of hiking over 21 miles the day before. My right foot was pretty sore and both of my little toes are sore. I got out of camp just before 8:00am. The morning hike was slow and sluggish. I hiked with Chuckles and Chicken Fry for a while but they quickly got ahead of me. I do not think I am eating enough. I only hiked 5 miles in the the first three hours of the day, which is a very slow pace. I just was not feeling that great. The weather was nice again, but the forecast for tonight and tomorrow is for rain and thunderstorms. Around 11:00am Jen from Norway caught up to me and we chatted a bit and then she took off. I picked up my pace and kept up with her until noon when she stopped for her lunch. I continued on from there with a much better pace, but I was focused on my feet and how uncomfortable I was. It was just kind of a bad day. I stopped at the second shelter of the day for a water refill and quick break. It was 2:30pm and I had done 12 miles, so my pace was clearly better then when I started. I moved on up the trail towards the next shelter which was about 7 miles ahead and 2000 feet lower. My right leg started hurting in the back calf area. This was a new pain and was very discouraging. I slowed down for a bit and then I hiked with another hiker from Utah. I forget his name. We hiked together for 3-4 miles and then I stopped for a break and he went on his way. I reached the last shelter in the Smokies at 5:20pm. I had done 19 miles to this point and was actually feeling better. I decided to hike 3.5 more miles to the hostal so I would not have to camp in the rain. I whipped through the next few miles and when I came to a road crossing which was less then a mile from the hostal a man in a truck was just pulling up and saw me and asked if I needed a ride. I asked him if there were any motels around and he told me yes and he would bring me. I was psyched. He took me to Newport TN. Which is about 15 miles away. Turns out this guys son is also hiking the trail and is only a few days behind me. His sons trail name is Machete. I checked into the Quality Inn, then took a shower, which felt awesome. Then I walked across the street and got some fried chicken at the Crackle Barrel. I am in my room now and not sure if I will hit the trail tomorrow or take a zero. I made it through the Smokies in 4 days which is pretty quick. It was beautiful, but I'm glad I am through them so now I can camp where I want and there should be much more water on the trail. All of us hikers will get spread back out again too. I just hope I wake up tomorrow and feel ok. I hiked over 43 miles in the last 2 days. That's kind of over doing it.","Pecks Corner Shelter

Taking a shower and getting a good night sleep was also much needed. I slowly got up and made my way to the free breakfast and took full advantage of it. I ate with a couple of ladies who were doing some section hiking and they gave me the number of a shuttle they were using. I made my way back to my room and went through my pack and debated whether to take the whole day off or get back out the trail today. Rain was in the forecast and my feet and legs could use the rest. After my bag was set I went back for more breakfast. It feels good to eat different food then what I eat on the trail. My legs were feeling alright and my attitude was much better then the prior day. I decided to get back on the trail today. I checked out at 11:00am and it was pouring. I put my rain gear on and went access the street and had lunch at the Crackle Barrel. The rain let up and I walked to the Family Dollar store and got a few resupply items. Then I made my up the road where I would unsuccessfully try to hitchhike for about an hour. It was a tough spot because it was the entrance to a highway. I ended up calling the shuttle that the ladies told me about. I got back to the trail around 2:00pm and met another female hiker who name I can not remember, but I have seen her quite a bit for the last week. We hiked a mile to the hostal where there were a ton of hikers. I got my mail drop that my brother sent me with a few days of food. I talked with some other hikers, including Vino from Austraila, Loud mouth, who is the nicest guy ever and has anything but a loud mouth, and Badger was there too. I gave some of them my oversupply items, which always makes other hikers happy and that is a good thing. I left the hostal right before 3:00pm and headed up a big accent. It was a 2475 foot climb over 4.5 miles. It was really nice going up. The rain had stopped and the sun even came out a little. I was taking it easy and did not really have a destination in mind. That was until I got about 3/4 of the way to the top and it started pouring rain and then the thunder and lightning came. So here I am at the top of this mountain in the rain for the first time and it is thunderstorming. I booked it as fast as I could down the other side of the mountain to the Groundhog Creek Shelter. There are a zillion people here, including Jenn from Norway and Loudmouth. When I got here I found a spot to set up my hammock and put my tarp up first. Then I put all my stuff under it. Then I hung my hammock. It worked pretty well. I managed to keep everything dry. I then ate and talked to Jenn for a bit and now am in my hammock all nice and dry and comfortable. It was not too bad hiking in the rain, but now that I have experienced hiking on the top of a mountain during a thunderstorm I can cross that off the list of things I have done and I will try not to do that again.","Pigeon River Bridge

One thing that was pretty cool was that our entire shelter area was awoken this morning by load singing owls. There must have been a dozen or more of them all who who whoing. It was wild sounding and something I will never forget. After that the morning stunk. I did not even want to get up. Everything was soaking wet. I managed to keep all my gear pretty much dry, but it took a lot of effort and time to do that. I slowly and methodically took down my camp sometimes just staring at my stuff trying to figure how to get everything back in its place without getting it all wet. I wiped my tarp off with my camp towel and then rang that out which helped. My shoes were soaked. My socks were soaked. Fortunately right now I have several pairs of them. I made my way over to the fire in front of the shelter to chat and to put my soaking wet shoes on before I left camp. I tried drying my insoles by the fire with little results. I left camp around 9:30am. My pack was wet and heavy and it was still very foggy. My morning hike was not bad but I was just trying to maintain a steady pace. It was a bit on the slow side, but it was good and I was enjoying looking at the forest all wet. The forest floor is really starting to come to life now. I was passed by several hikers including Jenn. I made it to the top of Max Patch around 1:00pm. It was totally socked in by fog. There was no views which is too bad because I hear they are very good. As I made my way down I caught back up to Jenn and we hiked together. The next shelter was only a mile up so we were going to stop there and have lunch. About 2 minutes after we made that decision we rounded a corner and ran smack into the best trail magic so far. A big fire going. A ton of food and drinks. Chairs all around the fire and lots of happy hikers. We were all still soaked and to be able to eat hot food take our shoes off, dry our feet and shoes by the fire and enjoy each other's company. It was pretty cool. They had baked beans with chunks of Hamburg in it that was really good. I also had a banana, yogurt and some chetos. I would love to do a trail magic like that in the future. I left the trail magic by myself and expected Jenn and the others to catch up to me. I felt really good leaving and had good energy. I still was at a steady pace in the afternoon, but it was a quicker pace. That is how its been for me lately. Slow in mornings and faster in the afternoon. I hiked alone most of the afternoon as nobody caught up to me. At around 6:00pm Chicken Fry caught up to me at the top of Bluff Mountain. there was a great camping spot there, but there plan was to go another 3 miles down the mountain and camp there. Thin Mint showed up right after Chicken Fry and I asked if they minded if I came down with them. They did not mind so off we went down the mountain Chicken Fry hikes fast so he quickly left Thin Mint and I. So I hiked with her for a bit until she needed to stop and rest her knees. I flip flopped with Chicken Fry a few times before reaching old road at mile number 266.2. I was the first of us to get there and quickly realized there was no good spot for my hammock. Time was short as it was 7:30pm. I decided to go into the woods up on a knoll. I found a spot and quickly hung my hammock and tarp. I made a quick dinner, brushed my teeth and then hung my bags in a tree. It was dark now but I could see the fire going below so I went down and Chicken Fry, Thin Mint, and Chuckles were there with several other. They were making there dinner. We all talked for an hour or so when who walks down the trail right at us. Its Jenn and two other hikers hiking in the dark with headlamps on. Jenn had fallen during the afternoon and twisted her ankle and had some abrasions. I figured they would stop and camp where we were. After all it was now 9:30pm. However after chatting a bit all three of them decided to head to the next shelter which was another 4.2 miles away. Shortly after they left I said goodnight and headed back up to my knoll to get in my hammock for the night. Tomorrow I will be in Hot Springs. They have had some real bad wild fires just outside of town and the trail has been closed. I am not sure if it will be open in a few days when I head out of town. I hope it is.","Groundhog Creek Shelter

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529719,"It was really nice out last night and I had a great night sleep on top of my knoll. I slept soundly and woke up at 6:20am. I did the normal camp breakdown and ate my breakfast and then headed down off of my knoll. I met Chuckles, Chicken Fry, and Thin Mint at the bottom as they were having their breakfast. Everyone remaked how they slept great. After a short conversation I headed down the trail with 7.5 miles to get to Hot Springs. I was curious how Jenn, whose trail name is Norway, was doing. I made good time as it was a beautiful day. I stopped at the first shelter around 9:30am. There was one woman still at the shelter and she said ""Norway"" had left about forty five minutes earlier. I then headed back down the trail with 3.2 miles to town. It was a nice gradual down hill all the way to the village. The first place you come to is a hostal. I asked a few hikers if Norway had been there and they said she had just left. I caught up to her a few minutes later and we walked into town. The AT goes right down Hot Springs Main Street. As soon as we got down to the main strip we ran into Elektra, who is now Rock City, because she is from Detroit. It was good to see her as I started with her and had not seen her since the 2nd or 3rd day on the trail. She was catching a shuttle and was getting back on the trail today. After catching up with her she headed out and Norway and I checked out a few places to stay, but they were already full. There are bad wild fires in the mountains just outside of town and the trail is currently closed past Hot Springs for fifteen or so miles. We eventual found room at the Laughing Heart Lodge Hostel. I went right into town after we checked in and Norway stayed back and got herself settled first. I went straight to the outfitters store to get new shoes. I tried on about six different brands before finally buying some Keens. I then went to the Laundry Matt. When I went to put my clothes in the dryer this very unfriendly lady from the motel in town was using all the dryers and had more to dry after. I did not want to deal with it so I took my wet clothes back to the hostal and hung them on the clothes line, which ended out working better anyways. From there I took a shower and put on some town clothes that the hostal provided. I went to the Smoky Mountain Diner and found Chuckles and Thin Mint there. I stop and talk with them for a while and order a burger. I would see them again later at the hostal. After eating I ran into Norway and we went to the river and stuck our feet and ankles in the cold water for twenty minutes. On the way back to the hostal we hit the Dollar General and picked up a few things, including ice cream! Once back at the hostal I went through my pack, figured out my food situation and decided to take another shower but this time I shaved my face after, which took forever because I was using a cheapo razor and I had a months worth of growth. I am not use to having that much facial hair and I really did not care for it. It has been pretty warm so it was time for it to go. So sadly for all those who wanted a full thru hikers beard it is not going to happen. It was also nice because several people commented that I looked 10 years younger without it. I went out and socialized for a while and told Chuckles and Thin Mint they had to figure out a trail name for me. Thin Mint pretty quickly said ""Baby Face"" I am not sure about that one, but it has been almost three hundred miles and I have only met three other hikers without a trail name, so hopefully soon. What do you all think of ""Baby Face"" for when I shave I have good healthy looking face skin and most people out here have beards. I am not sure what I am doing tomorrow. The trail is closed for the next fifteen miles. They are doing free shuttles but I heard you have to sign up and they may all be full tomorrow. My next food drop is only a mile from where they are shuttling us too. My package is suppose to be there sometime tomorrow, but I am not sure it will be. It is in Knoxville now. I guess I will just figure out tomorrow tomorrow. I am sure it will all work out. Tonight I am sleeping on a pretty comfortable futon and life is pretty darn good.","Old Road

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529871,"I slept in a hostal for the first time since the day before I started my hike. It was ok. Very different then staying in a hotel that is for sure. There were at least 25 hikers there. I slept ok and woke up around 6:00am. It was still dark so I waited until it started getting light before I got up. I had a coffee and got back in bed and caught up on a few sporting events that I have not been keeping up with. I eventually got up and went down to the town diner and had breakfast. It was a perfect sunny spring morning. After breakfast I went back to the hostal and grabbed the package that I was sending home and headed to the post office to mail it back. The outfitters store opened at 9:00am and I had some time to kill so I walked out towards the edge of town staying on the AT. I walked half way accross the bridge which a good size river flowed beneath. So that will be my begin or end point when I get back. Upon returning to town I stopped at the outfitters store and they said they again were doing free shuttles around the wild fires to the next gap about sixteen miles away. I went back to the hostal and got my pack and then headed back to the outfitters. I got a seat on the 11:00am shuttle and was on my way. Along the drive you could see some of the burned areas. When I got dropped off I had about a two mile gentle hike to the hostel where I had my brother mail my next resupply box too. I made the decision to just stay in my crocks. I had my arch support and inserts in them and they felt good. The big reason I did this is because I have developed a big bone bruise on the back of my right heel. It is very painful to even a slight touch. With the crocks that area doesn't get touched. So I headed up the trail and I had no problems as the terrain was easy. I made it to the Hemlock Hollow Inn Hostel around 1:30pm. The people running it were super nice. My package had not arrived yet. I did not have cell coverage so I used there phone and called my mother to check the tracking. I really did not want to stay there overnight. I wanted to get back on the trail. The tracking said my package was out for delivery and it showed up a little after 2:00pm. Several other hikers staying there had just come back with the co owner and they had five pizzas. I was just finishing repacking my bag and they said I could have some pizza so I had a piece and it was really good. Then the owner drove me back to the trail head. I offered twenty dollars for the mail and ride but they would not take my money. I think when I go back to finish that part of the trail, which is now closed due to the fire I will stay there with them. I headed back up the trail with my four days of food and two pair of shoes. My pack was very heavy. I was still wearing the crocks. It was all uphill for the first 4-5 miles. After an hour or so I ran up on Norway, Storm Crow, and also Garrett and Michelle, who are now Cup Cake and Burrito. I have not seen them since before Franklin. I had hiked and camped with them on and off when I first started. They started the same day as Norway and I. It was good to catch up. I ended up hiking with them on and off for the whole day. I made it to the first shelter around 4:00pm. I got water chatted a bit with other hikers and then headed on two more miles up to the top of the mountain. At around 5:00pm I made it to the top and started looking for a place to camp. Cup Cake and Burrito were hiking with me and they were looking to stop also. There was nothing good and the terrain was getting harsher and harsher. We were on a rocky ridge that just went on and on and on. We did have some rely good views which we stopped and took in, but then our search for a good camp site continued. At about 7:00pm we finally found a spot. A hiker named Older Dog was off the trail one hundred feet in a flat area. I asked if there were room for more and he said absolutely. So we had our camp spot finally. We all did out set ups and made our dinners and struck up some nice conversation. It is a very nice spot where we are. We are up high and you can see the valley floor all lite up in lights. It is really pretty. Darkness set in quickly and I cleaned my stuff up and went to hang my bear bag and in the process slipped and fell backward while landing right on an old root. It jammed hard Into my back and really hurt. I showed the others because I knew it left a good mark and they were all like, ouch! Cup Cake put some neosporin on it and a band aid on the part that was bleeding. We all talked a bit more and are now in our tents and hammocks. I ended up doing a lot more miles today then I expected too, but only because I could not find a spot to camp. I love where I am tonight.","Allen Gap

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530028,"Last night was another great night of sleep. I can not get believe how good I sleep outside. It is actually becoming harder to sleep indoors. I am too hot inside. I am still loving the mountain air. I am having no problems with my sinuses and I feel great. I took my time at camp this morning and was the last one out at 9:15am. Burrito and Cup Cake got out around 8:45am and Older Dog left right after them. Burrito and Cup Cake came up with a trail name for me. ""Footlocker"" due the fact that I have two pair of hiking shoes strapped to my pack, I have several extra insoles and arch supports and I also have a pair of Crocks. So it is done. I am Foot Locker. So I left camp late and had a good slow morning hike. I stopped at the first shelter and got water. Burrito, Cup Cake and Older Dog were there too. I hiked on and off with them through the morning I had lunch at the second shelter with Older Dog, Bull Horn, Michelangelo, and a few others. The afternoon hike started easy with three gental downhill miles. The afternoon featured a 1600 foot accent over three miles. Before I started my accent I crossed a brook that was flowing good and I was excited because I could take my shoes off and soak them in the cold water stream. I took my Crocks and socks off and found a spot where the water was a foot deep or so. It felt so good. As they were soaking I looked in the water and I could see a fish swimming in this small pool. I then walked in the water to try and catch it. I tried with my bare hands for five minute and I did manage to get a hand on it, but I couldn't catch it. I then went downstream a little where the water was shallow and I built a trap. I just had to corral the fish into this area and the. I had a big rock that would close the entry once I got the fish into the trap area. It took another ten minutes but I finally forced the fish into my trap and blocked the only way out with the big rock. I then easily scoped up the fish and was pumped up that I just caught a fish without using fishing line and bait. The only bummer was it was not a trout. It looked like it may have been from the Bass family. Anyways the fun was catching it and now knowing I can do it. I could have cleaned it and ate it but decided to put it back in the water and let it go. Michelangelo was there and witnessed me catching it, so that was cool too. After my little fish adventure and feet soaking I made my way up the three mile climb. It was a hot afternoon with no breeze so I worked up a good sweat as I had good energy going up. I made it up to the top around 6:30pm and found a place to camp for the night. Shortly after Michelangelo and Hopper showed up and we are all camping in this spot. It is a nice spot up over 4000 feet with good views. I am hoping to due at least fifteen miles tomorrow and around the same on Thursday. That would get me into Erwin on Thursday afternoon. I am hoping my heel is better so I can stop hiking in crocks by Friday.","Firescald bypass

Last night at about 1:00am thick smoke from the recent wild fires blew into our area. It made it difficult to sleep and it was very windy. It is the worst I have slept out here since early on when it was so cold. I got up around 6:00am and decided to modify one of the pairs of hiking shoes I am carrying. I have a bad bone bruise on the back side of my heel. I have been wearing crocks the last two days and I do not want to keep doing that so I thought I would cut out the heel piece of the shoe where my bruise is rubbing. I have a very small but sharp knife. The heel part of the shoe is very strong and has hard plastic in it. When I pushed the knife down to go through the heel it folded back onto my thumb slicing it pretty deep. It bled like crazy. Luckily I have a hearty first aid kit with me. I put gauze on it and held pressure but it did not want to stop bleeding. Finally I put a band aid on it so I could finish packing up. Right before I was headed out the band aid was soaked in blood so I undressed it cleaned it good with alcohol and applied some Neosporin. I then put a band aid on it and then tegaderm over that. I was not feeling that inspired on todays hike. I did go up and over big bald which had awesome views, but overall I was alone and did a lot of thinking about all kinds of things. I did manage my 3rd twenty mile day. However at about 6:00pm my not so great day got a whole lot worse. Half way up a mountain the skies opened up and a nasty thunderstorm hit. I was stuck. I stood under some rhododendrons, which really did not block that much rain. I put my back pack rain cover over my pack and then draped my raincoat over my head and pack and just stood there for about 40 minutes. It stunk, but I actually managed to keep my head, back, and feet dry by doing this and I was not getting cold. As soon as it started letting up I took off up the rest of the mountain and found a great spot where three other really nice guys were camping. I rolled in and set up my tarp. Once that was up I was relieved. I could now keep myself and my stuff dry. The rain stopped and the other guys came out of there tents. One guy had a guitar and was playing. I liked it and it picked my spirits back up. We all chatted and I made dinner and did the usual evening camp stuff and now I am all nice and warm and comfortable in my hammock.

Around 1:00am we all were awoken by the huge sound of crashing thunder. It was like we were right in the middle of the storm. It was the loudest booms I have ever heard. I got out of camp just before 9:00am. There is something about morning hiking in the sun when it rains the night before. There are a lot of people out here listening to music while they are hiking. I know I may get to that point later in the trail but for now I really love the sounds of the forest. The wind, the birds, the water running, and even the planes flying well above. There are so many sounds from different things. I just find it very peaceful and feel like I am in tune with nature and the mountains. So I hiked about ten miles into Erwin today. I am staying at the hostel. I am in a cabin with three others. Wolf Strength, Shark Nato, and Amy. We have a good group. We are all heading into town in a bit. Mexican food and a stop at Walmart.

I stayed in a four bunk cabin with three other hiker. Amy, WolfStrength, and Shark Nato. The hostel provided everyone a ride into town so we could get dinner and then go to Walmart. I went in a converted yellow bus. We packed 20 people in it. It was kind of crazy. I had dinner with Amy, Quebin, and Red Wing. When we got back I got my pack all ready to go so I could get an early start. I talked with Amy as she stayed in the cabin when we got back also. She does not have a trail name yet, so I was not the last one to get one. I was up and on the trail at 7:45am. It was a nice morning. I weighed my pack before I left and was discouraged to see that it weighed in at 39 lbs and 1 ounce. That is way too heavy. I am switching some gear in about a week when I get the Damascus. I am also going to have to get rid of some more stuff. I really need to get it to around 30 lbs fully loaded up. The hike today was mostly uphill. It seemed to never end. It got hot around mid day. I also must have been the first one on the trail because I cleared out a million cob webs with my face for about two hours. That was no fun. As I got higher I got some nice views and around 11:00am I ran right into some trail magic. Banana Bread, Brownies, and an Orange. I hiked until 1:00pm and ran into more trail magic at Beauty Spot Gap. There was also fantastic views from up on the hill there. I continued on and up Unaka Mountain. What was cool about this mountain was at the top all the trees were hemlocks. They were all covered in moss and it was quite the contrast to what I had been walking in all day. It was beautiful. I hiked for over ten hours today and am camping alone pretty high up a small mountain. I hiked alone all day. I did not run into very many people. I just want to say I re read some of these entries and found a bunch of typos. Ten years ago they would not have bothered me like they do now. I am doing all this on my phone while laying in my hammock and it is usually right before I go to bed and I am very tired. So I am sorry for that.

The first ten miles of todays terrain was relatively easy and very enjoyable. I made great time. The second half of the day it became more overcast and they were predicting rain and storms. I made it to Roan Mountain and had a big afternoon uphill hike of about five miles. I reached the Roan Mountain Shelter around 3:00pm and decided to try and make the next shelter before the rain came. The hiking and trails were really nice. It was a beautiful area. I went through some more hemlock forest which I love. As I reached a large parking area the clouds were thickening. I could not get cell phone coverage so I could not check the weather which was frustrating. I had 3.7 miles to the shelter and my shin was starting to hurt. I adjusted how I was walking and still maintained a fast pace up two sets of balds. The views would have been great, but it was now very overcast with fog rolling in. I made my way to the shelter but nobody was there and it was very run down looking. It was only a little after 5:00pm so I decided to go 1.8 miles to the next shelter which was a converted barn and could hold twenty people. I made quick work of those last few miles and sure enough there were a lot of people here and I beat the rain. A fello thru hiker was here with some awesome trail magic. Hot dogs!!! They were so good. I also had a Sprite and two Brownies also. Another nice surprise was that when approaching the shelter I heard my name being called. It was Rock City. It was really good to see her. I like her and we literally started together the same day at the same place. We even got picked up at the train station together. We talked for a while and got caught up. I liked it. It made me feel good. I also met Nature, and Cup of Tea. Both very nice. There were also two fellas here, Hot Rod and Slow Poke who I met on the trail during my first week. They tried to trail name me ""Nascar"" back then, because I was talking about racing with them. I declined that name. The other thing I am doing tonight is staying in a shelter on a hard wood floor. It is raining out and it is suppose to storm all night. This place is huge and we are all upstairs. You can really here the wind howling outside. I met a couple of other nice people who are sleeping right next to me. Christine and Taylor from Greenville SC. They are doing some section hiking and I have been taking to them quite a bit as we got in our sleeping bags. Super nice people.

It was a cool shelter but I could not get comfortable at all. When laying on my back my lower back hurt and when I laid on my side my hips and shoulder hurt. My body was not happy at all. I am old. On a positive note I was in terrific company and all my stuff stayed dry, and so did I, and it was just one night. I am not sure how I will handle heavy rains and storms going forward. I was up and on the trail around 8:30am. It was raining when I left and I had all my rain gear on. It did not rain very long, but the forecast was for rain on and off for the whole day so I just left my rain gear on. It was only nine miles to the hostel where I was staying. I hiked alone the first four miles or so then I hiked the rest of the way with Rock City. It ended up being a pretty cool hike highlighted by several big balds with crazy views. To the east it was clear and the sun was shining illuminating all the mountains as far as you could see. Then to the west it was dark and overcast with patches of low fog and clouds. It was really beautiful. We then scrambled through a rocky rooty section before the terrain eased up for the last few miles. Rock City and I stopped as we exited NC for the last time. Ever since we entered the Smokies we have been going back and forth between NC and TN. We took some pictures and headed off down the trail. I really enjoyed her company today. I am sure soon enough we will both hike our own separate ways and hopefully will continue to run into each other as we head north. We checked into the Mountain Harbor Hostel around noon. Hot Shot, Slow Poke, Poppie, Little Jane, Nature, Cup of Tea, and Echo were all staying here tonight too. I did not do much in the afternoon. Got some laundry done. Stuck my lower legs in the brook, and talked to my brother on the phone for a while. I bought dinner here as this place in also a B&B. It was the best meal I have had in quite a while.

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531191,"I woke up this morning and had breakfast in the Bed and Breakfast house. It was amazing. I wish I could have eaten more, but I still have not got this hiker hunger everyone talks about. I sat with some young guys from Florida who came up to do some section hiking. When I first arrived for breakfast there were a dozen people or so and I kind of stayed to the side and did not have much to say. Large groups of people and socializing has always been a struggle for me, especially if I do not know many of them. I do much better in small group which is why when we sat down to eat as a group of four I was much more comfortable and the conversation was pleasant and enjoyable. I went back to my bunk after breakfast and packed up my pack, said happy trails to everyone and was on my way north once again. I hiked on the road a few tenths of a mile until I hit the AT. The morning hike was amazing. The sun was bright and the hiking was beautiful and I was singing away. I went through a lot of meadows. The grass is already knee high. The forest has definitely come to life, especially below 4000 feet. Everything is green and full of life. I passed several large groups of butterflies. The first batch there were two or three dozen and the second group there were probably a hundred of them. Some were yellow, some were black, and some were dark purple. I tried getting a pic of the second group, but it did not even come close to what I saw with my eyes. I followed a nice small river for a while and passed by many good flowing streams. The sounds of the forest with the streams and birds singing was awesome. I also was making great time in the morning. I felt great. As early afternoon approached it started to get overcast and the forecast was calling for rain and storms later in the afternoon and all night. I had an ambition idea to hike twenty five miles to the next hostel so I would not have to spend the night in the rain and storms. The terrain was more difficult in the afternoon and I started to hear rumbling from above. I pushed hard and only stopped a few times briefly during the day. Around 2:30pm dark clouds were above and it started raining. I quickly charged into my rain gear and of course it stopped ten minutes later and the sun came back out. I heated up quickly and had to take my rain coat off but I left my rain pants on. I was still making good time and got to the last shelter around 4:00pm. The ski was ominous but I decided to go for the hostel which was almost another seven miles ahead. I pushed hard and about ten minutes after I passed the shelter I was almost to the top of a mountain when the thunder and lighting and downpour hit. I again quickly put my rain coat on and continued on. This is the third time I have been caught up high during a thunder and lightning event. It is very unnerving to say the least. The good thing is this storm only lasted fifteen minutes or so, but long enough to soak my feet. I also had tucked my rain shell mittons on my waist belt from my pack because I was too lazy to take my pack off and put them away. At some point I dropped them and by the time I had noticed it was way to late to backtrack. They were kind of expensive too. So that stunk and now I have no rain gear for my hands. I managed to make good time at the end of the day through the endless ups and downs even though by this time I was over twenty miles and really feeling it. With less then a mile to go it started raining again, but not as hard, just enough to be a pain. I reached the road at 6:30pm after hiking 25.1 miles and I did it in 9:45 that is pretty darn good. As I reached the road there were two older guys just finishing up fishing. I went over and said hi and asked which way the Big Bear Hostel was. They told me to sit on the tailgate of their truck and they would drive me down. It was about a half a mile down the road and I was so happy not to have to walk it. I thanked them big time and was now on my way to the hostel, which is also a resort. When I checked in I asked what my options were. I could stay in the bunk room or a cabin. The cabin was significantly more money. When I went into the bunk room it smelled awful and was totally unappealing. I went back out and was going to take the cabin, but the really kind lady running the places offered to let me stay in a second much nicer bunk room all by myself. It has a coach and TV along with five beds and it smells clean. It was also only $25.00 for the night. So I took it. I showered and I made one of my camping dinners. It also started storming and raining steady about a half hour after I arrived. It is going on 10:30pm now and it is still raining pretty good. I am so happy tonight. I just watched Shanhai Noon while going through my gear and maps. I know I need to deal with the wet and rain, but not tonight. There is no internet service here so I am not sure of the weather tomorrow. I hope the rain lets up and I can do a short day tomorrow and get into Hampton.

It rained pretty much all night so I am glad I did a big push to get to the Black Bear Resort And Hostel. The people were awesome there. I lingered a bit in the morning because it was so murky looking outside. I finally left at 9:30am. I walked the half mile back to the trail, which I thought would stink, but I rather enjoyed it. It was a back road with a good small swollen river raging. There were fields with all kinds of birds out singing. It was just really relaxing. At 9:45am I was back on the trail. The morning hike featured another river which was swollen due to the recent rain. Within the first few miles I came upon a raging waterfall that was pretty high and the water was thundering over. I really liked the smell of the water in the air. The trail followed the river for quite a while before an almost 2000 foot accent over the next two in a half miles. I reached the top around 12:30pm. It was a very overcast day with not the greatest visibility, but it did not rain with the exception of a ten minute shower. I got down to the bottom of the mountain by 2:00pm and went into town to get my mail. I did not have much of a problem hitch hiking. I got my package and thought about staying at the hostel there in town, but the weather was suppose to be better tonight with only a fifteen percent chance of rain, plus I miss sleeping in my hammock. Three night in a row without it. The hammock is so much more comfortable to sleep in then anything else. So I was back on the trail a little after 3:00pm. I was hiking in an area where all the campsites and shelters are closed due to heavy bear activity. The other thing I have run across yesterday and today is the aftermath of wild fires along the trail. Yesterday I walked for miles through the destruction and today there was another smaller area. It smelled and looked awful. I hiked until about 6:30pm when I found a nice spot to camp off to the side of the trail. I am on top of a knoll with a big lake below. I hiked over fifteen miles of the trail today and probably another two sideways miles. I'm hoping to be in Damascus by Thursday. I guess it might snow with the cold front coming in. Weather has been a really big motivating factor to move my butt, so I am thinking I will make it. Virginia here I come.","Big Bear Resort and Hostel

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531423,"Today was a different kind of day. It was much cooler then it has been and I hiked in a long sleeve shirt for the first time in a long time. I got up and out on the trail at 7:40am. That is good for me. It was a cloudy morning and I was already up on the ridge from my hike yesterday. Todays terrain was pretty forgiving. Mostly smaller more gradual ups and downs. The sun started to peak in and out around noon and I hiked through some long farming areas with big wide fields with open views. I even had to hike through a heard of Cows and Bulls, big ones at that. I finally broke down today and put my earphones in and listened to some podcast during the afternoon. It became cloudy again towards late afternoon. I hiked alone today and ran into a whole new group of people. All of whom seemed nice enough. I walked at consistent pace today and because it was cooler and the terrain was moderate I did not need as much water. I reached the Abingdon Shelter around 6:00pm after hiking 24.6 miles. I went down a steep long hill to get water and then decided to keep hiking so I could do my first hikers marathon. I reached a nice camp area about a mile in a half down the trail, but I was still two tenths of a mile short of the marathon. I kept going another half mile or so until I found I place to set up camp. 26.7 miles today. I really do not feel that bad either. I guess 30 miles will be my next goal. When I finally stopped and began to set up camp I discovered I had really messed up. I some how forgot the cord that attaches my tarp to the trees. I am so bad at camping and I really do not even like it. My favorite part of camping is when I can finally just get in my hammock nest so I can be nice and comfortable. All the rest of it is just work. So I had to improvise for my tarp cord. I cut a piece of my bear bag cord and took another piece of cord off the actual tarp. I will replace it tomorrow when I am in Damascus. I have about eight miles to Damascus in the morning. I am taking a zero day on Friday so I will be there two nights. I have not taken a day off since Fontana, which was just before the Smokies. My body, mostly my feet, need a day off and the weather is suppose to be cold and rainy. It is pretty cool tonight, but I still have my cold weather gear. Most people have switched over the lighter warm weather gear. I am making the switch in Damascus. It is suppose to warm back up in a few day so I should be ok. I really need to do it because my pack is too heavy and my feet need the lighter weight. I am really comfortable now. It is raining lightly on my tarp and it is kind of soothing. I am glad I am warm and dry and the rain started after I got in my hammock for the night. All the glory to God.

First, it got pretty cold, second the wind really picked up, and third the light rain turned to a hard driving rain. My tarp was blowing violently and I was feeling very vulnerable and uneasy. I was afraid the wind would uproot my stakes therefore exposing me and all my down quilts to the pouring rain, which would have been a really bad situation. I only slept a few hours and fortunately my stakes held up and I stayed dry. It was cold and wet when I got up around 7:00am. I struggled to pack up my camp as my fingers were froze. Having to untie a bunch of knots in that weather was frustrating. It took a lot more time then normal but I finally got everything packed up and had a little breakfast. I was cold and happy to finally be walking. I had an easy eight or so miles to Damascus and five to the Virginia state line. I hiked a moderate to slow pace all the way to town. I stopped at the state line for a picture. I am in Virginia now. Virginia takes up about a quarter of the whole trail and has the more miles in it then any other state, so I will be here for a while. I got into town at noon. The trail runs right through the town. I decided it was time for me to have a break and I checked into a bed and breakfast in town. I will be here tonight and tomorrow night. After I checked in I took a shower and then went and got some lunch at Mojo's Coffeehouse. I ordered a chicken chipotle wrap and it was awesome! After lunch I got my mail package that Greg sent me and then checked out some of the outfitters in town. I think I am going to switch to a tent and sleeping pad and send my hammock home. I willl not sleep as good, but I will feel safer and I will have my own shelter when it rains. I should be able to keep my stuff dryer too. I can always go back to the hammock if it does not work out. I will also be able to set up and break down my camp much more efficiently, which will make me happy. It rained most of the afternoon here and it is still raining. It is suppose to get near freezing in the mountains tonight and tomorrow night so I am really glad I am in town for these two nights. It worked out perfect. I did some prep work and packed up some stuff I am sending home during the afternoon before heading back out into the rain to get some dinner at Bo Bo's. I got Chicken Parm and it was really good. Now I am getting ready for bed. I should sleep good. I can not wait for breakfast here in the morning.","2 miles past Abingdon shelter mile 460.7

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531948,"My day off in Damascus yesterday was good. My feet appreciated not hiking, however I did seem to walk around town quite a bit. I made the final decision to go with tent camping for a while and see how I like it. I bought a tent and pad at Adventure Damascus. The guy who helped me was great. His name was Brant. He did a pack shakedown of my pack and I ended up sending 7 pounds of stuff out of my bag home. I hope it all works out. I just can not keep hiking with a 39 pound pack. My feet can not handle it. The bed and breakfast I stayed at was overpriced and the breakfast was not very good. The room was nice and quite though. They also had a hot tub. The best part of that was letting the jets massage my feet. It was almost as good as Anne from back home but not quite. Anne is the best masseuse ever and I miss her massages. I ended up mailing several packages back home and reorganizing my whole pack. It is like I am starting out new. My pack felt so good leaving town this morning. I hit the trail at 10:00am. The trail overlaps with the Virginia Creeper Trail several times, which is a popular biking and multi use trail. It follows a river which was very swollen and running violently down stream. It was pretty cool and nice to hike next too. Eventually I hiked back up into the mountains passing many streams. Todays weather was really nice for a change. The rhododendrons are finally starting to bloom. Ever since Georgia I have been constantly hiking through rhododendron tunnels. I am glad they are finally coming out. I met two new people today. Boston, from Boston, and Not Chris. Both very nice. I hiked at a mellow pace today and reached the Lost Mountain Shelter around 5:30pm. I got water, then made my dinner. After dinner I was going to hike for a few more hours, but Hot Shot, Slow Poke, and Nature were all set up camping here so I decided to just stay with them. We had a fire and I met another really nice hiker named Golden. We chatted by the fire for a while before I eventually set up my new tent, which was easy and quick, unlike setting up my hammock and tarp. I got into my tent and blew up my new sleeping pad and worked on my new candle system. I have a small aluminum can which I cut the letter ""I"" in and then I folded it back so the front was open. I hooked up the can to the loop in the center of my tent and put the small candle in the can and lite it. I made a few adjustment and had it working great. It really warmed the can up and did put out some heat. It will also help keep condensation out of my tent. So now I am in my new tent. I feel pretty comfortable.

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532103,"My first night in a tent was pretty much as expected. I did not sleep that great. The hammock is so much more comfortable. It did rain pretty hard at times during the night and I did feel safe and secure and I stayed perfectly dry as did all my gear. I will try the tent for a few weeks and if it goes well I will keep it. If I can not stand it I can always go back to the hammock. I would have to make some adjustment though. It was also on the cold side during the night and I was not near as warm as I had been in my hammock. It was my first night using my twenty degree down quilt. I had to put on some cloths part way through the night. I hope it starts to get warm again soon, but I think they are taking about cold weather again late next week. I was slow getting out of camp. I did not want to get up due the cold and everything being wet. Once I did get up it was much easier to get everything together and organized then when I had the hammock. I was one of the last ones to leave the shelter area a little after 9:00am. The morning hike was yucky and mucky. It was really overcast and windy. I had a big four mile uphill climb over Buzzards Rock and Whitetop Mountain. It seemed to go on forever. The wind at the top was practically blowing me over and it was chilly. I had all my gear on, which now entails a hiking shirt, a thick mid layer with a hood and a wind jacket. I now have very little cold weather gear, but my pack was well below thirty pounds today, which felt great. The morning hike was not much fun, like I said before there was muck and mud everywhere and the trail was slick. After noon the weather started to improve. I had lunch with a new guy that I met in a road crossing parking area. His name is Wook, as in Wookie. He was a nice pleasant young man. After lunch I hiked through some meadows that were loaded with wild flowers and started to get some good views down into the valley. It was hazy, but was still nice. Around 2:00 pm just before reaching the first shelter I came into a big open expansive field and saw what everyone talks about. Wild Ponies. There were about ten of them in this field. It was pretty cool. As I passed by the shelter and continued on I kept running into them for the several miles. They were not afraid of me or anyone else either. Some would stand right in the trail and make me go around them. The afternoon weather got better and better and the hiking was outstanding. I was up over 5000 feet much of the afternoon. There were expansive pastures and field with huge rocky outcrops. It was my kind of hiking. I took my time and really enjoyed it. Todays hike also took me through Grayson Highland State Park. It was beautiful as was the entire afternoon. I made it to the Wise Shelter around 7:30pm. I said hi to the people in the shelter before looking for a place to set up my tent. It was weird that there were no other tents there. It was getting late so I found a spot and quickly set up. I then went to the shelter again to make my dinner and that is when I found out that there was no tenting allowed at the shelter because we were still in the state park and they do not allow tenting at the shelter. I quickly made and ate my food and then proceeded to take down my tent and head back on the trail. It was now getting dark as the sun was setting. I checked out a few spots but they were too uneven. I hiked another mile in a half before I found a clearing. Then I noticed someone else up ahead. I said hi and asked if I could camp at that spot with him. He said of course I could. His name is Gary and he is from Dapper Virginia. He is a very nice guy and we talked the whole time I was setting up. It was now well after 9:00pm. Once I got my tent up and my bag hung I looked up and noticed the perfect crescent moon in the sky. It was picture perfect. A great way to end the day. I said goodnight to Gary and entered my tent. I am hoping for a better night of sleep tonight.","Lost Mountain Shelter

Maybe I can get over that addition by the time I am done with my hike. Last night I slept pretty good. I only woke up once. I was happy with that. I like having my own little space in my tent. I woke up around 6:30am and as I packed up and ate I chatted with Gary and then I was back on the trail around 8:00am. It was a little warmer today and it felt good after all the cool weather we have been having. The morning hike was nice as I again went through some large open fields. I saw my first large game also as a deer spotted me and bolted out of the bushes near me and down the hill. I soon entered the woods again and would stay in them much of the rest of the day. I caught up to Doug who I have been seeing a lot on the trail lately. His hiking companion had to drop off the trail this week with chronic knee issues. I have heard of several people dropping out lately. I hiked with Doug for a short time and we stopped and had lunch at one of the shelters with Yellow Jacket. After lunch I pushed on. It was a good day for hiking and the terrain was a bit rough. Lots of uneven large rocks and roots. It reminded me of back home hiking Mount Monadnock. There were Three or four good ups and downs. I hiked at a normal pace. I am trying to just hike a consistent pace and not overdue it. I stopped for my dinner on top of the last pretty good climb of the day around 5:00pm. After I ate I hiked the last two miles too Trimpi Shelter which is where I am camping tonight. It was good to stop a little earlier as I could take my time setting up. I just heard a very load crack of a branch breaking outside my tent. I went out and yelled and started a little leave fire in the fire pit next to me. I hope whatever it was it goes away.

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532421,"Today was the hardest most difficult day on the trail for me so far. I found out around 2:00pm that a great childhood friend of mine passed away. His name is Peter Johnson. I went to school with him from kindergarten through our high school graduation. We were really good friends all those years. We played sports together and together we were captains of our varsity baseball team our senior year. We hung out all the time. Our lives took different paths as we entered adulthood, but all those years and good times together were real and I will always remember Pete. So smart, so quick witted. He had the best sense of humor of anyone I have ever met and he was just a really nice guy. So today as I found out this news I was stopped dead in my tracks and basically collapsed to the ground. I was on top of a mountain and it took me over an hour to even move. I spoke to my good friend Brett by phone who also knew Pete. I eventually got up and slowly started walking. I could not focus. I questioned what I was doing. I cried and I just thought about Pete all afternoon. Today was also a day where I ran into so many nice people on the trail. Little Santa, Wook, Cheeks from England, Cheesy, Strider, Wild Flower and Diligent who I am camping with tonight. I love how all the hikers have a certain unity and I needed that today.

We tented in a tall grassy area by an old school house. The rain let up around 7:30am just in time, because I had to go to the bathroom. I was the last one to get everything packed up. I was going to meet Diligent for breakfast in Atkins three miles away at a place called, The Barn. When I came out of the woods onto the road he was waiting for me at the gas station before The Barn. We then walked up and had a pretty darn good breakfast. We also needed to charge our phones and devices and we were able to find some open outlets. After a long breakfast we went our separate ways. He hit the trail and I hitched into Atkins and Marion. I had to pick up a mail drop and then went to Walmart for a few other supplies. I was really rushing and felt myself being very impatient. I had to stop myself and made the better decision to stay in town and fully charge my electronics, do laundry, dry out my stuff, and just reorganize. It would also be good to get off my feet for a bit. I will head back on the trail first thing in the morning. I have a shuttle picking me up at 7:25am and it only cost fifty cents. It is about six miles back to the trail. It only took me about fifteen minutes to hitch a ride into town today after breakfast with Diligent. A nice local guy named Jim Frye picked me up. We had a nice chat on the way to town. All I have to say is people are amazing. I met a former thru hiker named Beer Man when I was repacking outside of Walmart. He offered to drive me back to the trail right then. I told him when he finished shopping I would be ready to go. While he was in the store that is when I thought better of it. I had not showered in five days or done laundry. My chargers were dead and I just felt unorganized. When he came back out we talked a bit and he recommended a place for me to stay and then he was gone. Like I said. People are amazing. There are so many good people in this world and sometimes I think I let the few bad apples sway me. The trail is making me see a lot of things more clearly and I think people are amazing. A lady in her 80's came out of the store and asked if I was thru hiking. I said, yes ma'am I am. She then handed me a small card and said it was for me to have on the trail. It was scripture. John 3:16 ""For God so loved the world He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life"" I turned to her and showed her my metal tag hanging down the side of my pack which was the same scripture with the same writing. She was taken a back and told me I was on the right path and I was going to do great. She had a big smile on her face. We gave each other a big hug and we chatted for a little bit before she went on her way. Like I said, people are amazing and this encounter made my whole day and also confirmed that I was suppose to stay in town tonight. I then finished loading my pack and headed to the Travel Inn. I checked in took a shower and then headed out to find lunch. I ended up at Wendy's and had a double cheeseburger and fries, all the while the music was playing was Christian Rock. I was now in slow down mode, not rushing. I was taking my time and enjoying the afternoon. It is so different down here compared to the darker Northeast. I walked bye the Baptist Church. It was very big and beautiful and the grounds were immaculately taken care of. It was awesome. I headed back to my room and organized my gear, charged my devices and did my laundry. I can not wait to get back on the trail tomorrow. I only hiked the three miles today, but I did a ton of walking around town. I wish I would of been off my feet more, but I had things to get done. I think I am finally starting to lose significant weight. My pack belt has no more room to tighten. I may have to get a smaller belt or a new pack. I am spending a lot more money then I anticipated. It my own doing. I have made mistakes and bad decisions and it has cost me. Tomorrow I will pass the one quarter mark. Hopefully I can make better decisions from here on out and make up some of the lost money over the rest of my trip. I just got off the phone with Val. I am very lucky to have such a great housemate. Thanks Val. For that matter I am lucky for all the people in my life. Thanks to all of you. Just a final note.

He is headed back to Damascus for Trail Days this weekend. I am staying on the trail. Trail Days sounds like one big drunk fest party. That is not why I am here. There are a lot of venders there from all the different outfitters. I would like that part. I may come back for it in a future year when I am not thru hiking. I have seen a lot of southbound sections hikers this past week all headed to Trail Days. They will spend a week on the trail and then the weekend in Damascus celebrating Trail Days. I could see me doing something like that in the future. Back to my hike today. I was on the trail around 8:30am. It was a nice sunny morning and the trail went through a lot of fields. The grass is waist high now. If you ask me it is time to hey it. I saw a lot of wild flowers. The flocks are all out as well and the Rhodo's are in full bloom. It was a nice morning hike. As the morning went on it got noticeable hotter and very humid. Once we left the fields I was glad for the tree cover above. All the trees have there foliage now so it provided much needed shade. I hiked at a pretty slow pace. My pack had five days of food in it and it was just so sticky out. There was several good climbs where the sweat was just pouring off me. I hiked much of the day with a new person I met on the trail today. Her name is Scorpion. She is from Indiana and we spent a few breaks together talking. We also hit the one quarter mark together(546 miles) and took pics for each other. I eventually got out in front of her and made my way to the shelter around 5:30pm. I waited there for about ten minutes and then decided to move on to a camp area a few miles ahead. I got there around 6:30pn and set up my tent and made my dinner. At about 7:00pm Scorpion showed up. The clouds were thickening and you could hear the thunder rumbling in the back ground. I was eating and talking to her as she was setting up her hammock. She had a brand new tarp and after another boom in the background she insistently told me to help her get all the ropes untied so she could get it up. I helped and just as it started to pour down rain we finished getting it up. I ran to my tent an threw all my stuff in my tent, including my bear bag full of food.

There are people out here who do, but I am just not comfortable doing that. The rain stopped around 7:00am and I got up and packed my stuff up. My tent fly was obviously soaked so I put that in an outside pocket. I stayed nice and dry in the tent overnight and have been sleeping a lot better in it then I though I would so that is a good thing. I left camp around 8:30am. It was a sloppy muddy morning hike. Lots of slipping and sliding. The sun came out around 11:00am and it turned out to be a great day. Much dryer with cooler temps in the Seventies. I stopped in a big clearing just after noon and had lunch. I also took my tent fly and tent out and let them dry out. It worked good with the sun and wind and only took fifteen minutes to dry. Scorpion passed me, but after I packed up I ran into her a little later as she was taking a break I would hike much of the afternoon with her. She is very nice and great company. I ran into Uncle Spider and Raptor again today, which was good. I received a message from my cousin and good friend Jimbo Pierce. I called him back and we talked for a little bit. Pete was friends to both of us in high school, so we talked about Pete a bit. We were all really close back in those days. It was a good talk and I am glad we had it. After we talked I was off hiking again and I ended up at the Jenkins Shelter where there were a lot of hikers staying, including Scorpion. Everyone was really nice.

I slept with all my cloths on. I have a quilt that has cinches with drawstrings on each end. I had both ends cinched shut and my whole body under the quilt with just a hole for my nose and mouth. The sides of the quilt were tucked in underneath me. I slept ok but the few times I woke up I was a bit chilly. When I woke up around 6:00am I had to get up and get moving so I could warm up. I ate quick and packed up and was leaving camp right at 7:00am. This was the earliest I had left camp and I was one of the first ones out. I was planning on at least a 23 mile hike so I was happy to be on the trail early. I knew I had an uphill to start the day so I left camp and turned up the hill. I hiked swiftly so I would warm up. It only took about ten minutes and I was feeling warm. I only had a 600 foot accent to start the day according to my guide. After a half hour I was expecting to be at the top but it kept going up. I was starting to question my guide. At 8:07am I saw a person coming down the trail towards me. As she got closer I recognized her. It was this little German women named Elizabeth who I had pasted the day before. When I realized it was her I new what I had done. I had turned the wrong way out of camp and had hiked 2 miles in the wrong direction. She asked me where I was going and I said I am going south arnt I. She said yes. Then I told her I had made a mistake and had turned the wrong way out of camp. I was frustrated, but could only laugh. I turned around and literally ran back down to the shelter that I had left a short while before. I got there at 8:40am filled up my water and headed in the correct direction. I have heard of other people making this same mistake so now I can check that off the list of things I have done. I was plenty warm now and still maintained a good morning pace. The terrain today was on the easier side so I made great time. It was a crisp cooler day with good sunshine in the morning. I stopped for lunch around 1:00pm and noticed the sky starting to darken. I checked the weather radar on my phone and there were some good showers right about to hit the area. I cut lunch short and started moving. I still had five miles to the next shelter so I was not going to make it there before the rain. I pondered putting my tent up if I found a good spot, but I never found one. As the rain begin I stopped and got out on my temporary rain gear. Leaving Damascus I had no rain gear, but when I was in Marion I picked up a couple of trash bags and a small three dollar umbrella. So I put my two trash bags on and took out my umbrella and walked while it rained. The trail followed a paved road for about a mile during this rain event so the walking was easy. As soon as the trail re entered the woods the rain stopped. I stayed perfectly dry and was pretty darn happy. It got really windy and even cooler in the later afternoon. The sun eventually came back out but the wind kept blowing hard. I caught up to Scorpion with about five miles to go to the second shelter. We hiked together for a while. We took a short break together at a road crossing and talked to several other hikers. After the short break it was about three miles to the shelter. A few miles later we went by the six hundred mile maker. I stopped and took a few pictures and Scorpion kept going. I got to the shelter around 5:30pm. It was very windy there and it is forecasted to be cold again tonight. I decided to hike another mile down to the camp area by the creek where it would be less windy. When I got there Scorpion was there along with Wolverine, Flash, and Good Talk. It was a nice small group. We all sat around the fire and made our dinners. It was nice. I am hoping I do not freeze tonight. I have all my cloths on again and it is forecasted to get down into the thirties. I am cold right now writing this. I hiked 24.2 miles officially today, but really I did 28.2 if you add in my backwards miles.

He had wished he would have come down lower. I could hear the wind blowing well above us but we were protected from it. I managed to stay warm but I was not too comfortable and when I got up around 7:00am it was freezing packing up. I was glad to get hiking. I hiked the morning with my smart wool liners under my pants and all my shirts and jackets on. It was relatively easy terrain. It was great hiking weather as the sun mixed in with the clouds and the temps never made it out of the fifties. If you stopped very long you would start to get cold rather quickly. I had to make a half mile detour to pick up a mail drop at Trent Grocery. It was a mile round trip and then I was back on the trail. I hiked alone all day today. As 2:00pm approached I reached the first shelter. I stopped and had lunch with four or five other nice hikers. Everyone was freezing after a few minutes of not moving. I managed to rest for about a half hour before I was back on the trail. I had a little over seven miles to get to the Woods Hole Hostel. I originally was not planning on stopping there but there is a frost warning tonight and I do not feel like being uncomfortable for the third night in a row. I ended up with a pretty big climb after lunch. It was about 1300 feet up onto a ridge line. I got up it without issue. There was one spot that had a great wide expansive view. I took a break there and soaked it all in, at least until I started getting cold. Then I was off again. I pushed the next four in a half miles and made it to the Hostel around 6:30pm. There was only a few other hikers there. They said all the others had gone into town to eat. There was a note telling me to go up to my room so that is what I did. I took a nice hot shower. It felt awesome. I then got my stove and was about to make a camping dinner when all the other hikers and hostel owner drove in. They brought back a ton of food. They did charge $20.00 but it was all you can eat and the food was amazing so to me it was worth it. I ate a lot and it felt good to be full on real food. This is a pretty nice Hostel. Diligent is here. I am not sure how I caught up to him. I am in a room with two other hikers. Kenosha and Papa. Both really nice. In the morning we are having French Toast and I love French Toast. Tomorrow I will have a shorter day into Pearisburg. I may take a zero day on Tuesday. I will see how I feel.

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533564,"I was glad to be indoors last night and not freezing outside. It was another cold night outside. I did not sleep very well as Papa snored most of the night, but that is the chance you take if you stay in a shared room or bunkhouse. I was awake for good around 5:30am. I just relaxed in bed until 7:00am. I then was up and waited for the coffee to be made. We all had breakfast together at 8:00am and it was awesome. Great food and great company. It was probably the best French Toast I have ever had. The fresh cooked bread was great too. It was one of the better hostels I have stayed at. I left just after 9:00am and had to hike up the steep road a half a mile before I got back on the trail. It was a cool brisk morning hike. The terrain was on the easy side but only had a short hike to get to town so I really took it easy. As in hiked I thought of a few things I forgot to mention in yesterday's journal entry, like the endless beautiful rhododendron tunnels and the dozen or so small bridges I had to cross. The trail followed so many steams and small rivers that were all really nice. So back to today. I stopped at some ledges with a great view and ran into Papa and several other very nice hikers. One of them named Rucker. I ended up hiking with her for quite a while and we struck up some nice conversation as we went. We eventually caught up to Papa and hiked down to the road leading into Pearisburg. I walked the mile into town and checked in at the Plazza Motel. When I first checked into my room I was feeling a bit uncomfortable. The room has concrete blocks as its walls. They are painted white and it is a very basic room. I met another hiker who is in the next room and asked her what she through. Her name is Shades and she seemed quite nice. She said it was not the best but the bathrooms were good and clean. I checked her room out and it was similar to mine. I then just put my pack down in my room and headed to the post office to pick up my package. I was hungry so I got a late lunch at the Dairy Queen next door and then headed back to my room. It turned out Shades was right. The room is ok. It is clean and the bathroom is very clean. It is not very sound proof, but for $44.00 bucks it is fine. After I showered and shaved I went into the small downtown to the barber but he had closed for the day. I stopped at the Rite Aid and picked up a few things before heading back to my room. I spent the rest of my evening going through my pack and organizing for my next five days of hiking. I have 92 miles before my next stop. That will be my longest stretch without stopping so far. That is if I make it all the way. I gave a few of my extra food item to Shades and she gave me a few things. We talked for a few minutes and then I was back in my room. I spent a lot of time looking at my maps trying to figure out my next Three or four stops and mail drops. I am up late tonight and although I do not really like this motel I think I am going to zero here tomorrow. It is suppose to rain all day and my body could use a day off. There is rain in the forecast everyday for the next two weeks so it should be interesting

For all that do not know what that means it is just a hiker way to say I am not hiking at all today. I did do a little running around town to the post office and stores but mostly I am trying to stay off my feet and give them a good rest. I bought a few movies at the Goodwill Store and am watching those. It is a wet dreary day out so it is a good day to take off. I really like the lady who runs this motel even though I am not crazy about the motel itself, but because of her I am enjoying my time here. I am switching hiking shoes again so we will see how that goes. There is a lot of rain in the forecast for the next four days and I have some famous spots coming up like McAfee Knob. Hopefully the weather will break when I get there in a few days. I want to say hi to everyone back home. My whole family and all my co workers at the hospital. Thanks for all the continued support. I can not believe I have had 10,000 views of this journal. That is crazy! Please keep signing it when you check it out.

I packed up and left the motel at 7:45am. I walked a mile to the trail head where I had left off. I was back on the trail at 8:05am. It was cloudy but not raining to start the day. It was not a bad first few miles out of town. It was relatively flat and I walked on the road a bit to cross a big river. I could not help but also notice parking lots full of cars as I walked by. Everyone is at work and I am not. I am hiking through America. How lucky am I. Soon after crossing the river I was back in the woods and soon after that I was headed uphill as is always the case when you leave town. After a few hours of going up I finally entered the fog. At first it was ok. It was beautiful in its own way. I did not mind it for a few hours, but then it got windy and then it started raining on and off and then I stopped seeing the beauty in it. It was a pretty miserable afternoon. It was muddy and wet. I was told the views were great in spots as I hiked along a ridge line, but all I would see today was fog. I stopped and had a quick lunch with a guy named Sasquatch. He is hiking southbound. After lunch I did not stop again because I just was getting too cold when I stopped. I made it to a place called ""The Captains Place"" around 6:30pm. This guy lets you camp on his lawn and he gives out free soft drinks and he lets you use the wifi. The only way to get to his place is to zip line across a river, which was kind of fun. I made my way over and there were about seven or eight other hikers here already. I took my pack off and made my dinner. I was not sure if I was just going to eat and then hike on, or just call it a day and camp here. In the end I decided to stay. It was still raining a bit and the fog was still an issue. I set up my tent and enjoyed an orange soda pop and I have a candle going inside my tent and I am nice and warm. I hope I stay that way all night. I have a plan to get out early tomorrow and do a big day. Hopefully close to thirty miles. Rain is forecasted for Fri and Sat so I want to get some big miles in while the conditions are favorable. I hope it warms up soon and stops raining all the time.","Pearisburg VA

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534092,"I had a good night sleep in my tent at The Captains. The rapids in the river were very soothing to sleep next too. I was up around 6:30am. I did the normal morning stuff got everything packed up and left at 7:30am. I had some discussion with this other nice guy who tented near me. His name was Odisious or something like that. I was looking for an alternative to zip lining back accoss the river. In the end I zip lined myself back to the other side. It is tough by yourself as you have to pull yourself across. It is much easier if someone else pulls you over. So I got myself across without any issues. I unhooked my pack from the caribeaner and carried it up the hill. I strapped it on and all I needed was my trekking poles and I would be on my way. The problem was I forgot them on the other side of the river. Dang it all. I slipped my pack off and went back to the zip line and Odisious was just about to come over. I yelled to him and asked if he could get my poles. He went and got them and then I pulled him over. He had fallen in the river trying to come across the day before so he was happy to just hold on this time and have me pull him over and I was happy to have my poles. So now I was really ready to head up the trail. It was 7:50am. The morning hike was soggy with a lot of mud. I also had a big climb. It did not take long and I was back in the fog. The weather was for fog, clouds, and rain showers. I had a good feeling the sun would come out and that it would not rain all day though. I made good time up the mountain. Once it flattened out it got really rocky with larger rocks. They were real slick due to being wet. I was feeling good and was going through them at a good clip. Apparently too good of a clip because before I knew it I had slipped and I went to catch myself with my trekking pole like I always do, but this time the trekking pole also slipped on the rocks and down I went. I landed hard on my side. My hands were scuffed a bit but the big hit came to my right ribs. That is what I landed on and I landed on a big rock. It hurt but all I heard in my brain was ""get up"" so I did rather quickly as the ground and rocks were all wet. I just got hiking again but at a much slower pace. It was right after this that I caught up to Shades who had left town before me. It was nice to see a friendly face. I told her about my fall and we hiked together for an hour or so until she stopped for a break. I continued on and made it to the second shelter by 12:30pm. Golden was there. I have crossed paths with him on and off for over a week now. He is a very nice man probably in his Mid to upper fifties. I moved on from the shelter after a short break. I had another big climb and as I was making my way up the mountain the sun started to come out. It would come in and out for the next few hours. The weather in the afternoon was great for hiking. No fog, no rain, good air, and some sun. I was feeling really good. I passed my third shelter in the afternoon and kept on going. There was one more big climb before a nice ridge hike. The skies continued to clear and more and more sun shined down. This last climb however was brutal. There were no switch backs. It was straight up for about 1300 feet. I was determined and I dug in and marched up. I was breathing hard but I made it up in just over an hour. Once up on the ridge there were no more clouds in the ski and it was all sunny. I had a feeling that was going to happen today. I had an amazing four mile evening hike across this ridge. I passed my forth shelter of the day around 7:00pm it was so beautiful up there I could not stop. There were several spots where the views from some of the ledges were awesome. I even saw a deer about fifty feet from me at one point. He was not even afraid of me. He looked at me and then kept eating the vegetation. I videoed him and he still did not run off. It was a big dear too. The scenery all along this ridge was really nice. I got a little carried away because now it was getting late. I had to find a place to camp or hike three miles down the mountain in the dark to the next shelter. I knew I would find a place, just like I new it would turn out to be a great day with sunshine. I found the perfect spot at the end of the ridge. I set up camp as the moon was rising in the east and the sun was setting in the west. Totally beautiful. Even though I fell today and hurt my ribs it was one of my best days out here. I am safe and comfortable on top of a mountain in my tent. Today is also my friend Sue's birthday. Sue has been my best friend for the past five years. She is an amazing women who I will always think fondly of. So Happy Birthday Suzy. I wish you all the faith, hope, and love in the world.

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534224,"I woke up this morning and I felt like I had been run over by a bus. Not only were my ribs sore, but my feet and legs also hurt. I over did it the day before doing 26 plus miles. I also did not have enough water when I stopped to camp. I was up until after 11:30pm journaling. Sometimes that is just the way it goes out here. I had big rewards for doing a big day, but this morning I paid for it. I started hiking going downhill for a change. It was slow going as my feet and legs took a while to loosen up. I also seemed to lack my normal energy. It seemed to take forever to get to the first shelter. Before I got there I ran into a spring and filtered and drank a bunch of water. It was the best water and sure enough my energy level and mood improved immediately. The sun was out in the morning and it was pleasant. The forecast called for rain later in the day and hard rain overnight. I was thinking about doing another really big day to try to get to Daleville a day early, but I could knew after my slow morning pace that this was not going to happen. I took my maps out and noticed a hostel which would make for a 20 mile hike. I decided to go for that. The thought of being dry was a motivating factor. The terrain was moderate through mid day. I stopped and had lunch at a river crossing with two section hikers going southbound. I was about to go up a mountain which has the distinction of having a area called the Dragon's Tooth. After lunch I started up and the accent up was not bad. However once up top that all changed. The next four miles or so were the rockiest and hardest hiking I have done so far. It was endless ups and downs. They were not huge ups and downs, but with the rocky conditions it was difficult. The weather also was becoming increasing overcast and the fog was starting to roll in. The wind picked up and it was wet, raw, and cool. This made the rocks slick which added to the difficulty. It is too bad because you could tell if it was nice out the views and landscape would have been very nice. The hardest part of the hike was the decent. It was very vertical and rocky. It was very slow going because one slip and I would be falling a long way down. It was treacherous. I made it to the bottom and thought I was through the rocks, but I was wrong again. The rocks continued on and off all the way to the road. One nice thing that happened though was all the Rhodo's were out in full bloom for the last few miles. They seemed to pick my spirits back up. I finally got to the road which led to the Four Pines Hostel just before 6:00pm. It was raining by this point. When I got to the hostel I put my pack in the hostel and they took us to the Homeplace Restaurant. I had all you can eat fried chicken with potato and green beans with rolls. It was really good. When back at the hostel I claimed a very dirty couch to sleep on. There are twenty or more people here tonight. Rucker was even here for a bit to check the place out before moving on. People are set up to sleep everywhere. Everyone is talking and having a good time. It should be an interesting night. I spent some time talking to Verge who is from Winchendon. She, like me spends a lot of time hiking Mount Monadnock. Small world. Her mom is a nurse who worked at Heywood Hospital and she is on the trail also, but she is ahead a few hundred miles. So today was not the best day, but it was not worst either. I am dry tonight. I am sleeping in a three bay garage with twenty other hikers. I am living the good life. Everyone here is positive and happy. Life is good.","High on the ridge. Mike 681.9

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534378,"Last night was a different kind of night to say the least. I was told this morning there were over thirty hikers in the three car garage where I stayed and another ten in the barn. It rained all night so I was very grateful for the warm quarters. I ended up sleeping on this very old dirty coach and it was actually pretty comfortable. I put my ear plugs in and then I put swimmers wax on the outside of my ears. So I had double ear protection from the snorers. I was hopeful it would work. However at 3:30am I was awoken to double barrel load snoring. Two guys snoring away very loudly. It kept me awake for a while, but eventually I did fall back to sleep until around 6:00am when people started milling around. Shortly after that and I eventually got up. I was in no big rush to leave as I was planning a short 10.7 mile hike. Most of the others hikers were going to slack pack all the way to Daleville. Slack packing is when you have most of your gear and pack sent ahead and then you only hike with what you need for the day. It is a good way to carry a lot less weight and make big miles. I was going to camp a half a mile from McAfee Knob and then hike seventeen miles into Daleville the next day. I ate breakfast and talked with other hikers. I eventually left around 9:00am. The morning hike was very wet and muddy as every morning hike has been lately. I was quickly passed by Verge and Legs who were slack packing. I stopped and took a break with Farmer. It was good to talk to him. He hiked he Continental Divide Trail last year and we talked quite a bit about that. That trail is over three thousand miles long. After my break I pushed on. I hiked slowly during the morning as I had such a short day in store. There was no reason to push it. Once I got to the only big climb of the day I decided to pick up the pace. The weather called for clouds, fog, and thunderstorms by mid day, but the weather was looking better and the sun kept peaking out. I wanted to get up to the famous McAfee Knob before the storms rolled in. I made it there around 12:30pm. I was bummed because it was all foggy. No views. I took some pics anyways and decided to just hang up there. The shelter I was staying at was only a half a mile away so there was no reason to hurry there. I spent the next three plus hours at the Knob taking to people and just relaxing. Sure enough the fog also lifted and all the surrounding mountains appeared. I took two more rounds of photos. I met this guy who goes by Doobs. A super nice guy. He had a professional camera and took photos of me at the famous spot on the Knob and said he would email them to me next week. It was a great afternoon and I am so glad I did not slack pack. It was just gorgeous up there. Eventually I hiked down to the shelter and set up camp. I set up with Tick Talk, Lou, and Julie. Rucker was also at the shelter as was Doobs and seven or eight others. We all talked and hung out in between the few good rain showers we had late in the day. I had two dinners. Maybe I am finally getting the hiker hunger that I keep hearing about. We also had two deer visit our camp site. They just walked right in. They did not seem very afraid of us. I took some pics of them as they walked around. Tomorrow I am hopeful I can get up around 5:00am and go back up a half mile to McAffe Knob to see the sun rise. All accounts say it is awesome. I hope it is clear and not cloudy. Today was another very good day. It was beautiful and I am very grateful for it.","Four Pines Hostel

I packed up most of my camp and headed back up before 5:30am. It was still dark so I had to use my headlamp. The moon was out and was bright and beautiful. The lights of Roanoke were also bright and looked awesome down in the valley. I made it up to the Knob before 6:00am. The clouds had moved in but there were still slivers of sky to the east. I had my breakfast up there which was nice. Doobs and his girlfriend showed up while I was eating. Even though it was cloudy the formation of the clouds were very unique. We waited around for a bit and then the clouds moved away and the sun broke through. It was really nice. I spent about an hour in a half up three before saying goodbye to Doobs. I headed back to camp and finished packing my stuff and was on the trail around 8:00am. It was a very good day for hiking. Temps made it into the sixties and it was breezy all day. The trail followed a ridge line and then rose to the Tinker Cliffs, which offered amazing views looking back at McAffee Knob. I had about fifteen miles of hiking today so I took it easy. The terrain was much better then previous days and I hiked on packed pine needles a lot of the time. My feet were loving that and from getting a break from all the rocks. It was a tough ninety two miles. I crossed paths with Tick Talk, Lou, and Julie during the day and ended up hiking with Tick Talk into town. We checked into the Howard Johnson Lodge around 3:30pm. I picked up my resupply that Greg sent me and then headed to my room. I rounded up all my laundry and also took Tick Talks and got that done. I had dinner at the Pizza Hut across the street with Tick Talk, Lou, Julie and one other hiker whose name I can not remember, but she is a super nice lady. I am just relaxing in my room now and plan to head back out on the trail tomorrow. These last two days have been two of the best days I have had out here. I am so glad I did not slack pack. It was good to do these 25 miles over two days and really take my time and enjoy all that was around me. Oh! One other thing happened today. I saw my first Bear. He was up on a bank next to the trail around a hundred feet away so that was pretty cool. We also had a full rainbow in the sky on the way to dinner. I am now one third done the trail at 727 miles.

I saw Odisious who I met at the Captains Place a few days earlier. After I ate I headed back to my room and loaded up my pack. It is always its heaviest when I head out of town with five days of food in it. Before I got back on the trail I went to an outfitter store to pick up a few things. I also busted the tip of one of my trekking poles off so I was hoping to get that fixed. When I got there the place was busy and there was only one guy working. He said they had the tips and he gave me an adjustable wrench and a hammer. It took me a while but eventually I got the broken tip off. The whole pole had come apart during the process though and it took some more time to get the whole thing back together. Once I was finished at the outfitter I headed to Wendy's for an early lunch before getting back on the trail at 11:30am. It was a long but gradual uphill out of town. I saw my first snake which scared the heck out me. I am not sure what kind it was but I do not like any kind of snake. I did get a picture of it before moving on. Pretty early on my lower leg started hurting. I stopped and taped it but it bothered me all day. I did not hike too fast so it was a bit confusing. It is hurting right now as I write this too. I guess it will be slow going for a few days. I ran into Tick Talk a few times today but other then that I was by myself. The weather was nice and sunny until later in the afternoon when I seemed to be surrounded by rain and storms but none of them hit where I was so that was very good. I made my way to the Bobblets Gap Shelter just before 7:30pm. It was a quarter mile down the hill off the trail. I was out of water so I had to go down. I would have camped there but it was not a good for tents at all. I said hi to everyone then got my water and headed back up the quarter of a mile to the trail. I only had to hike another three tenths of a mile to find a great stealth spot just off the trail. I set up my tent then ate and cleaned up and now I am in my tent and it is late as usual.

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535012,"This day was the first day in a long time where it was all sunny all day long with no chance of rain. It also warmed up considerable getting into the eighties. The day itself was pretty uneventful. The night however was a totally different story. I hiked alone most of the day. I did cross paths with Tick Talk and chatted with him a bit. I stopped for lunch at a shelter and met a nice guy named Big Stick. We chatted a bit before I headed out. After lunch I had a good climb and drank a lot more water due to the heat. I had a lot of great views and it was nice not to have to think about rain or storms. My mind wondered on a lot of things that have gone on in my life over the past five years. I thought about Harry. He is such a good dog and we had endless good walks together on days just like today. As the day neared its end I came to a clearing and a big building with a huge white type ball on top. It was a major aviation center of some kind. It was massive. I almost stopped and camped there because I had over twenty miles in and it was 6:00pm. The next shelter was only a mile in a half away but it has been closed due to heavy bear activity. All the signs I was seeing along the trail to this point said everyone had to go at least to the Harrison Ground Springs Camp Area. That campsite was only 3.1 miles away and I knew I could make it there by dark. I decided to eat my dinner at the clearing which had an incredible view and then I headed down the trail to the campsite. The sun was setting and the views of it were very good so I stopped to take some of it in. After all, that is what I am here for. I arrived at the camp area just before 9:00pm. It was odd because nobody else was there. Then I saw a posting that this camp area has had heavy bear activity and that is was strongly discouraged to camp or eat there. It was now about dark. This was a bad situation. If someone else was there I probably would have stayed, but nobody was there. There was no way I was staying there. I got my headlamp on and started hiking to the next campsite which was 3.8 miles away. It got dark fast. About a half mile away from the camp area the trail split into two paths. I took the one that went uphill. About twenty feet up I stopped to make sure I was on the write trail. I turned around to see if I could find a white blaze. Well I did not see a blaze but what I did see was a big black bear about 25 feet following behind me. I was shocked and shaking. I yelled and banged my trekking poles together but it just stopped and starred at me. I then went to bang my poles again but slipped and sent some rocks down the bank. That seemed to spook it a little as it turned around and moseyed back down the path the other way. I started walking up the trail and my pace quickened. Before I knew it I was practically jogging the down hill parts of the trail. I just wanted to find people, but I had three miles to go. I was extremely nervous and anxious. I came to the top of a hill and saw lights down in the valley. I thought maybe a house. I was going to go to those lights no matter what. It turns out it was a group of thru hikers who had also had an earlier encounter with the bear. I was so happy to see them and told them so repeatedly. They told me I was flying down the trail as they could see my head lamp. I quickly told them what had happened to me and no sooner did I finish when we all looked back up the trail with our headlamps and there was the bear about thirty feet back on the trail looking right at us. It appeared that it stalked me all he way there. We were at a road crossing with a little pull over. They had there tents all set up. We yelled at the bear and banged our polled and thought it had ran off. We all talked a bit. These four people were so good to me. There names are Snickers, Elsa, Murph, and Doolittle. They are hiking as a group of four and also go by the name Team Blue, although now they are thinking about changing it to Team Bear. They ran into the bear in the actual campsite back a few miles where I had come from. They were also planning on staying there. After we talked and calmed down a bit we decided to go hang out bear bags. We wanted them away from where we were tenting. We struggled to find a tree and were not having any success getting the rope hung. After fifteen minute Murph went back to the tents to find the bear standing in the middle of our camp area. He yelled at it and we all came running back. The bear just slowly walked into the woods thirty feet or so and turned and just starred at us. We yelled, banged things, threw rocks near it. All it did was circle our camp and keep looking at us. We could see it plain as day ggbecause of its eyes reflecting from our headlamps. Team Blue packed there tents and then called 911. Then the park patrol officer called back and and said they would come out. Around 11:00pm two SUV patrols vehicles showed up. They had super high powered lights to see in the woods. They found the bear. After getting our story the two of them went into the forest with pretty big guns and high powered lights. About five minutes later a very load shot was fired. It made all of us flinch. They came back and said they had a shot on the bear but it did not go down. It was all so crazy. They eventually took us back up the trail three in a half miles to a parking area so we could set up our tents and call it a night. The one patrol officer who I rode with actually thru hiked the trail a few years ago with his wife. There trail names were Bark and Berry. He was very helpful and friendly towards us which was greatly appreciated because of what we had all gone through, especially me. So thank you very muck Bark, and I also can not thank Team Blue enough either. We all set up our tents after midnight. I slept in my hiking cloths and did not even clean up at all. All I can say is it is very scary to be stalked by a bear. Thank goodness my Mom had been praying for my safety in her bible studies. and my Dad gave me a neckless with a cross with Mary and Jesus to keep me safe. I also can not forget the cross neckless Sue gave me too. I know all these things helped protect me and all I can say is thank you God.","Stealth spot mile 746.3

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535025,"After a bad night of sleep in parking area and thoughts of bears filling my head I was up well before 6:00am. The patrol officers had brought us backwards three in a half miles. I mean I am happy I did not get eaten by a bear, but it stinks to have to redo those miles. I decided to walk the Blue Ridge Parkway down to Petite Gap where I left off. The Parkway follows the AT very closely. It is really strange because there is hardly any traffic on it and it is beautiful with a lot of parking areas with fantastic view. It took me two hours to get back to Petite Gap which is where all the excitement happened last night and where I left off. I was feeling very unsure about heading into the forest at this place. My gut said not to. I knew the group in front of me would be far far in front and the group behind would be far far behind. I did not want to be in that area alone so I called a shuttle and had him drive me ten miles down the trail to the James River Footbridge, which is the longest footbridge on the entire AT. I liked that this river was so big. To me it felt like a boarder for all those bears on the one side and I felt much better being on the other side. I do plan on coming back and doing those ten miles along with the sixteen in Hot Springs that I was forced to skip due to he wild fires. Both places are on the I81 corridor so I can hit them on the same trip back and then go visit my sister and her family. So when I got dropped off at the bridge it was only 9:30am. I wanted to go out on the bridge and walk across so I did. When I got almost all the way to the other side Scorpion walked out of the woods onto the bridge and walked straight to me. It was so nice to see a friendly face and person. She had been ahead of me for a while now. We stopped and talked and I told her about the bear and the entire nights events. She was getting picked up at the bridge and getting off the trail to be in a friends wedding. I sat with her until her ride came. After she left another super nice person who I have come to know appeared from the bridge. Rucker. I had to tell her my story. She was going to hitch into town and resupply. She asked me to come and I went back and forth in my mind as to if I wanted to go but in the end I decided not to. I was pretty well beat physically and emotionally. I wanted to do the 10.5 miles to Punchbowl Shelter and I wanted to go slow and get there early and try to relax a bit. It was also mostly up hill with some big climbs. She ended up getting a ride in like two seconds like all females do and then she was off to town. I headed up the trail. It was a very slow methodical hike. I had no energy and it was very hot as the temps rose into the upper eighties. I think all the factors from the day before just sapped everything out of me. The climbs were tough but I managed to make it to he shelter by around 4:30pm. The views from on top of the mountain were amazing and there were bushes flowering everywhere. It was hard for me to enjoy it like I normally would though. All I could think about was getting to camp and getting in my tent. So I set up and did the normal camp stuff. Rucker showed up about forty five minutes after me so she did dang good getting to town and back and then up the mountain. I have about twelve miles to a hostel that I am staying at tomorrow. One of the things I did by running down the trail the night before was I now have a new blister on my heel so that stinks. I hope it feels better in the morning.","James River Foot Bridge

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535217,"Last night was a nice night. I slept in my tent at Punchbowl Shelter. I set my tent up right next to the pond and it was great. The noises in the wilderness are awesome. Bugs, birds, frogs, the breeze. I slept great, which I guess is no surprise considering I barely got any sleep in bear land the night before. I was up pretty early around 6:00am. It was kind of funny because Rucker was making her breakfast in the vestibule area of her tent and she watched me get out of my tent. It takes me at least ten minutes to be able to walk normal because my feet are sore and stiff every morning. So she watched me slowly hobble towards the privy and jokingly told me at my pace I might be back to my tent by noon. I could not help but laugh. I eventually got myself all packed up and left the shelter area around 8:00am. I started off feeling ok, but it warmed up quickly and I found myself lacking energy like the day before. The good thing is I only had a 11.3 mile day to get to Three Springs Hostel. It was a lot of down hill today and that is harder on my legs and feet then uphills. I went at a very slow and methodical pace. Eventually the trail reached a creek and followed it for several miles. It was much cooler down along this part of the trail, but the black flies were out and they were a big pain in the butt. It was really beautiful down there though. There was mist coming off the river in spots and it smelled really good. I also passed over many small bridges, some of which were very unique. I hiked pretty much alone for the day with the exception of a little bit with Grey Ghost and Five Star, both of who I met at the shelter the night before and both super nice guys. I finished the 11.3 miles at 1:30pm and called the hostel to come get me. I also got Five Star and Grey Ghost a ride into Buena Vista from the same folks who run the hostel I am staying at. I was feeling run down and tired when I got to the hostel. I would have liked to have just taken a nap but I had stuff to do, like shower, laundry, eat pizza, drink gatorade, organize my resupply box, and organize my pack. I also spent some time figuring out where my future stops may be. There are five other hikers here. I remember Hammers name and the rest are alluding me. I am so bad with names. Everyone is very nice though. A few of them have pretty much been sleeping all afternoon and then went to bed really early this evening. I guess they are really tired. The weather has changed dramatically over the last few days from very cool to very hot and humid. It makes the hiking part much more difficult. I cooked a pizza here and had some other snacks. Then tonight I forced myself to eat a camping meal. I have lost more weight this last week and am down to a hundred and forty nine pounds. That is seventeen pounds I have lost since March 28th. Today I went over the 800 mile mark on the trail. I am getting there. Tomorrow I am going to slack pack 25 miles of the trail. I will be hiking in a day pack with only food and water for the day and these folks at the hostel will bring me my big pack at the end of the day. There is a fee of course. A lot of other people do this so I figured I would try it. It should help not having all that weight on my feet. So we will see how it goes.","Punchbowl Shelter

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535333,"I barely got any sleep last night. We had a big time snorer and I am a very light sleeper. I slept a few hours and then around 3:00am I could not get back to sleep. I finally got up and went out in the common room and laid on the couch. I slept maybe an hour there and then the lady who runs the place was up getting breakfast ready so I got up too. I think I am going to forgo hostels unless it is to get out of a rainy night situation. I sleep way better outside in my tent anyways. So I did my slack packing today and it was amazing. I was dropped off where I left off at the bottom of a big climb and hiking never felt so good. I flew up the Priest. I hiked the first five miles in two hours and 2500 feet of it was uphill and steep on spots. My feet did not hurt at all. It was the best. All I had with me was my water, filter, food for the day and stuff for my feet. I ended up slack packing 25.4 miles. I saw Five Star early on. Then I ran into Hobo and he gave me some of his water so I did not have to go .8 miles off the trail. That saved me a lot of time and was very nice of him. I then ran into Slim Rim who I just met a few days ago and keep seeing. She also gave me some water so I did not have to get off trail. People are so nice. It was another hot day but we did get a pretty good shower around noon. It actually felt good and cooled things offfor a while, but soon enough it was hot again. I made my way down the four mile decent to where my pack was waiting for me. The lady from the hosted brought it to the trail head at the parking lot. I quickly took my stuff out of the day pack I was using and put everything in my big pack. I was on my way back on the trail with my full pack at 6:30pm. It felt like a hundred pounds. My feet immediately felt the weight and screamed at me. I was bummed. I now know I have to fix my pack so it does not weight so much. I will go into Waynesboro in a few days and look at some different options and I will be mailing some more stuff home. I slowly made my way up a big incline. I was sweating profusely. It was 2.7 miles to the shelter and camp area and it was all uphill. I made it there just after 7:30pm. It was nice to see Rucker, Forest, and Mud Puppy. They had a fire going and were finishing eating. I set up my tent and then sat with them and made my dinner. It is always nice to be with people who you get good vibes from and that is how it is tonight. After in ate I hung my bear bag and just after that the rain started coming down. It was really cool as you could hear it plowing through the forest towards us and then it hit all at once. Tomorrow I plan on only doing a 15 mile day and I will be taking my time and resting a lot, especially if it is hot again. The day will start out with a climb of over 2000 feet. I am ready for sleep now. I love the sound of the rain on my tent. Should be a good night.","Three Pines Hostel

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535490,"It was good to be back in my tent and back outdoors again last night. I slept great and did not even wake up until 7:00am. I guess the fact that I hardly slept the night before at the hostel and that I hiked over 28 miles might have played into my good night sleep as well. Rucker made it out of camp before I did, but I was out before the Forest and Mud Puppy. The hike started with about a three mile climb up Three Ridges Mountain. I was glad it was morning and that we were on the west side of the mountain. It was still pretty cool which helps a lot. Forest eventually passed me going up and we would see each other a lot during the day. I reached the top around 10:30am. I was so glad to have that climb behind me. The rest of the day had no more big climbs. It heated up quickly but there was a nice breeze all day. It was a really nice day. It was humid, but it still felt good to me. I stopped at Hanging Rock Overlook which had incredible views. I dried my tent and took in the scenery for a good bit. I talked to Forest and a few other hikers before heading on my way. There were a lot of day hikers on the trail today. It is Memorial Day weekend and that has a lot of people out hiking. The hiking today was really good and I really enjoyed it. The forest seemed very alive as the birds were singing all day long and the breeze was moving through the trees. There was also a lot of rocky areas today, but that seems to be a theme in Virginia so far. Today reminded me of Mount Monadnock back home. I hiked pretty slow today. It was nice to just go slow and look around a bit more. I hiked with Forest for a bit until we got to Maupin Field Shelter. I ate my lunch there and got water and then headed on my way. I had my third bear encounter in the last week or so around 5:00pm. I was just hiking along and I looked out to my left and there was a big momma bear about a hundred feet away staring at me. Then I noticed her two cubs on the other side of her and was like, oh boy. I was already parallel to her when I saw her so I just kept walking normally. I did reach and get my phone out of my pocket to take a photo, but I was getting the star down from this bear so I decided not to stop and take a picture. She did not look happy with me. She stared at me all the way up the trail. I was glad to get past and be on my way. That is three adult bears and two cubs that I have seen now. If I am going to see them it is much more desirable to see them in the day. No doubt about that. Shortly after my bear encounter I came up to the road to some good trail magic. It has been a few weeks since I have run into any. I had a banana and an orange, along with some recess peanut butter cups and skittles. I only had two more miles to the campsite. It was uphill but it was not too bad. I made it there at about 6:00pm. Forest was there and there was a father and his two daughter there also. Mud Puppy showed up as did Slim Rim. The daughters asked if they could interview us for a school project of theres. We all said yes and they did there interview while recording it. We all ate and then watched a beautiful sunset out on the rocks. This camp site is a good one with great views. It was a very good day. Tomorrow it is into Waynesboro. I will probably zero on Monday, which is Memorial Day. The trails will be mobbed with day hikers, plus I am due a day off. I am planing on going to the outfitter in town to look into some different lighter gear. I am hoping that goes well. The Shenandoah National Park is the next part of the trail and I am very excited to see it.","Harpers Creek Shelter

It was a good night of sleep on top of a mountain. I was up and on the trail at 7:30am. The weather has been so nice these past mornings. I am loving it. The trail and forest continues to feel so alive to me. Today's hike was relatively easy and short, but very enjoyable. I took it nice and slow. I stopped for a break at the first shelter and saw Forest who was pretty excited because he saw a momma bear right on the trail with two baby cubs. He had to wait for them to clear the area before he could move up the trail. He was able to video it. It was pretty cool. The last five miles into town it warmed up a bit and then we got some refreshing light rain. All the rain up to this point has been a cold miserable rain. It was nice to get a refreshing rain that cooled you off but did not make you cold. I was passed on the trail by Slim Rim and then Mud Puppy passed me right before we came out to the road. He was excited because he too had seen a bear on his morning hike. The bears are everywhere lately. It is crazy. I had a half mile walk to the motel where I was staying and where I had my resupply sent. The father with two daughters who stayed with us last night picked me up and brought me the half mile down the road. They also were giving Forest and Mud Puppy a ride to the YMCA where there is free camping. I am at the hotel now and have been soaking my feet in Epsom Salt and doing chores. Tomorrow I am headed to the outfitter for a multitude of things. I talked to my brother earlier and he thinks I should get some heavy rugged hiking boots. I will talk to the outfitter about my feet issues and see what they say. So nothing too exciting today. I am watching the Coke 600 Nascar race now and I had Dominos delivered.

I need to make some gear adjustments and let my feet rest and heel. The outfitter here in town was limited in what they had. I really need to find a pair of hiking shoes that will work better for me. I also am feeling pretty beat up and a few good days off should do me a lot of good. It really stinks because I really like all the people I have been hiking with the past few weeks. Before today's zero I had only taken two zeros in the last forty two days dating back to Fontana on April 17th. I am kind of bummed to have to do this, but I know it is what I need. So tomorrow I am renting a car and leaving the trail for the rest of the week. I hope to be back on the trail this weekend. I already can not wait to be back hiking. Hopefully when I get back I can manage things better. You would think I would be figuring things out by now.

My bed was really comfortable and I did not want to get up and face the day. I eventually did get up and started getting myself together then I remembered the Quality Inn has breakfast included with a stay so I headed to get some. When I got there I saw Five Star right away. I sat down and told him I was getting off the trail for at least a few days and heading to my sisters. He has been trying to get a ride back to the trail head where he left off. His problem was he got shuttles forty five minutes into town and he was not having any luck finding a ride back. He was a actually a two day hike from getting to Waynesboro so he was going way back south. Then it dawned on me. I was renting a car and heading south to my sisters. I told him I could bring him back when I picked up my car. He was happy to hear this and excepted. I got the car around 10:00am. I paid for an economy car and ended up with a huge four door Dodge Ram four wheel drive pick up truck. I was not complaining because I knew it would be a much more comfortable four hour drive then in some tiny Kia car. When I left enterprise the satellite radio was on the Christian Rock channel The Message. I knew right then and there I was doing the right thing. I picked Five Star up and we were on our way. We made a stop at the outfitters and I returned the shoes I had bought the day before. We then hit the road for good and drove the forty five minutes to the Tye River crossing at mile 831. We had some good conversation and he asked me if I was a Christian. I said yes I am. Then he asked if I was born again and I said yes I am just over two years. His face lite up and he gave me a big fist bump. Turns out he too was born again fourteen years ago at the age of twenty one. It was nice to have his company and talk for the forty five minutes. I left him at the trail head and we said goodbye and I was back on the road to Holly Springs NC where my sister and her family live. I stopped in the town of Amherst to get gas and noticed a ice cream and burger place. I went in and knew right away that I had to eat there. Written scripture on the walls and a super friendly and warm atmosphere. The two young ladies working were so upbeat and positive. I ordered a double cheeseburger and sat and ate it at a table inside.   One of the women whose name is Kristie came out and said I could use the guitar or piano to play music if I wanted. I said I did not play but would love to hear her play. About five minutes later she and the other young lady named Hannah came out and sang a beautiful song together and Kristie played the guitar. They played the song 10,000 Reasons which is a great christian rock song. I videos it. It was so cool. When they finished I thanked them and told them how great they sounded. I then bought some ice cream and that was the perfect end to my incredible lunch. Thank you girls for your incredible kindness and all that positive energy. You two are great! Kristie also gave me a CD that her and her band had made. I look forward to listening to it. After a little more chatting I was back on the road with a big fat smile on my face. I had another two in a half hour ride and I got into Apex where I had to drop off the truck around 3:30pm. My sister picked me up and we headed back to her house. I spent most of the afternoon on the back porch icing and resting my feet. My nieces Abby and Jordan came home and then Doug eventually arrived after work. They made Miah Miah fish that there neighbor had just freshly caught the day before and it was incredible. After dinner Doug, Abby, and I went to the Orange Leaf and got some frozen yogurt. Now I am in bed and very tired. Tomorrow will be more trying to stay off my feet with some icing and lots of rest. I hope I feel some improvement.

It was pretty miserable, but I am am still hopeful they will be the solution in the long run. I had a very relaxing week at my sister with her family. They fed me exceptionally well and I am very thankful for that along with there gracious hospitality. Real food is so good after eating camping food for two months. I rested and iced my feet mostly, but on Saturday Doug, Jordan, and I went out and shot at clay disks with a shotgun on this course. It was my first time and it was fun. It was very hot and humid and we had some good storms come through which are always fun to watch, especially if you are on a house porch and not hiking on a exposed ridge line. I rented a car this morning and headed back to the trail. I was on the trail at 1:30pm. For some reason I was not feeling very energetic. My feet were uncomfortable and I hiked very slow and lethargically. I entered Shenandoah early on. The terrain was pretty easy but I just did not feel very good. I guess this is what thru hikers call the Virginia Blues. I did not see anyone until about 4:30pm. when I met a young hiker named Wicks. We shared a break together and hiked the last few miles to the shelter. I only hiked 7.7 miles but it seemed like a lot more. The shelter and tent area are packed here tonight and it is very loud. I thought that would be the case. I knew there was a big group behind me when I got off trail last week and now I am right smack in the middle of it. It's all good though. I think I need the people. They help a lot when myself and other people are down. People are good and I need to remember this. Along with new boots I also have a lighter tent. It is actually over a pound lighter.

I woke up and the air was nice and crispy and it smelled awesome. It reminded me of being at our summer cottage on the lake when I was a child. I was also pleasantly surprised by how well the problem areas of my foot felt. Granted I now have new problem areas due to the boots not being broke in, but it is a very good sign that my problems of the last months may be solved. I did a much bigger day today so tomorrow morning hopefully they will continue to feel better. I was up and out of camp at 7:30 am and right away the trail was beautiful. The flowering bushes went on for miles and miles. Everything looked awesome and smelled awesome and the fresh crisp air felt so good. It was a perfect morning for hiking. These are the days you just can not get enough of. I ran into a lot of hikers today. Shades, Goodtalk, Flannel, Stardust, Wicks, Yours Truely, and Elizabeth. There were also others I just can not remember the names. Elizabeth is a 64 year old women from Germany and she is the lady who turned me around about a month ago when I was hiking the wrong way on the trail. She stayed at the shelter last night and she remembered me and that morning. We had a good laugh about it. The terrain was easy today and so were the elevation gains and drops. I stopped four times for breaks. My feet needed it due to the new boots. My toes on my right foot were killing me. My right foot is bigger then my left so it is much tighter in the boot. It is frustrating but I did not let it get me down, not today. Today was a very good day. Yesterday not so much. I now know why Patches made sure I understood one of the golden rules of thru hiking. That rule is, you are not allowed to quit your hike when you are having a bad day. You can only decide to quit on a good day. I totally get that now. I have had several bad days, like the night before coming down into Damascus and a few of the rainy, windy, cold, foggy days, and of course yesterday. When I think about though the good days far outnumber the bad days and not just by a little but by a lot. I really love it out here. Tonight I am in a national park campground and it is beautiful. The wind is whipping so hard and is making so much noise. I love it. I am nice and comfortable in my tent. What could be better then this. So back to the rest of my day. I hiked the last six miles to Loft Mountain Campground. I checked in with Flannel and Stardust and we decided to all stay at one site and split the cost. My feet were very tired so I went to the site and they went to the camp store. I got my pack off and boots off and went to the camp store myself and took a shower. It felt so good to be clean. I then headed back and made dinner with Flannel and Stardust. When I was setting up my tent I realized my trekking poles were missing and I remember I had left them at the camp entry station. I went up to get them but they had closed for the night. I could see them inside so I should be able to get them in the morning. I hate that I do stuff like that.

The hiking today was incredible. A few more ups and downs, but the footing was great. I went through more flowering bushes and everything was so green and healthy looking. The scenery was gorgeous. I ran into my sixth bear today. It was right on the trail and walking straight at me and it was only about fifty feet in front on me. I banged my poles and yelled at it and it eventually jumped off the trail and into the forest and then I was able to scoot bye. I spent time on the trail with Puma, Good Talk, Flannel, Stardust, and half way through the day Chuckles caught up to me. I spent a decent amount of time with him all the way up to Hot Springs. I had not seen him since. It was great to see him and catch up on what each of us has experienced out here so far. He is a great guy. We both passed the 900 mile mark together so that was cool too. He was slackpacking today. I hiked with him until he got picked up at a trail head by one of his family members. Hopefully he will make it to Big Meadow Campground tomorrow which is where I am planning on staying. I ended up hiking around twenty one miles today. I was going to meet Puma at an old shelter which was listed in our guide book around mile 909. I was getting tired and just about to call it a few mile short of the site at a stealth site when Good Talk came by. He was also trying to reach that the old shelter. I decided to hiked with him the last few miles until we found the it. It ended up not being an old shelter. It was a converted shelter and was now a caretakers shelter and a really nice one at that. The caretaker was there with a fire going. Good Talk and I went up and introduced ourselves and what we were up too. It was getting late and the caretaker, whose name is Allen was extremely nice and friendly and let up camp at the shelter.

The new boot are doing a number on them. It is kind of funny because I can not hike fast at all in them and everyone else is blowing by me. I am Mr. slow poke which is not how I like to hike, but at least I am able to hike and my big foot problem seems to have stabilized for now. I made it to Big Meadows Wayside around 4:30pm with Slow Jam. There were a bunch of other hikers there as well. I ordered a Cheeseburger and Fries with a Sprite, and then followed that up with a delicious Blackberry Shake. All of that cost twenty bucks. Pretty pricy, but it is what it is. I was kind of planning on staying at this place which has a nice big campground, but it was so nice out still and I decided to hike another four plus miles to the next shelter instead. It was a beautiful evening hike as I was on the west side of the mountain so I was watching the sun come down. There were a bunch of view point which were fantastic as well. I stopped at one where Wicks was taking a break and he was taking in the views for all they were worth. I made my way down to the shelter and there were only a few people here. I met some new folks and Wicks eventually made it here as well. When I got here there were four deer all around the shelter grazing. It was pretty cool. Now I am in my tent. I am tired and I should be tired. Good night.","Old South River Shelter Site

I said hi Mr. Deer and proceeded to walk right by it and it just stayed there grazing and looking at me. When I came back up it was still there and still unphased by me. I walked right by it again within ten feet and got back in my tent. I could have taken two steps over and touched it, it was that close. It was a nice way to start my day. I was up and spent some time chatting with Wicks before I left camp around 7:30pm. It was a carbon copy of the rest of the week. Perfect weather and perfect hiking conditions with spectacular terrain. I did struggle a bit mentally on my morning hike. I stopped at the Skyline Restaurant at 10:00am. I walked in and it was packed. There were a lot of hikers there but I felt uncomfortable so I just left and got back on the trail. My feet were again very uncomfortable, especially all my toes on my right foot. I am not sure what to do about that. I have spent about six hundred dollars on shoes so far so it is getting ridiculous. I do still enjoy the trail a great deal and today offered some more outstanding views and I stopped at most of them to take it all in and air out my feet. I can only hike about three miles at a time right now, but I am making the best of it. I had lunch with IPA who I met only yesterday. He is a very nice guy. I also crossed paths on and of with Flannel and Stardust. I also met Less Mayo for the first time. It has been nice to have these picnic areas every so often. In a few days I will be out of this park and back to real AT hiking, like sitting on dead logs in the woods and any open field or road crossing. I have really enjoyed this park and all not has to offer. Today I saw bear number seven and another half dozen deer including a momma and fawn. It was really little too. It was awesome. I am tenting at a shelter tonight. It is really loud right now, but it is still early. I stopped hiking for the day around 5:00pm which is really early for me. It is only 8:00pm now so hopefully people will quite down in the next hour. I am closing in on one thousand miles. I will be in Pennsylvania in about a week. Crazy, crazy, crazy.","Rock Spring Hut

She came in late and set her tent up next to mine. She was very nice as we chatted for a short time as we packed up. Less Mayo, IPA, Flannel, and Star Dust were also in the immediate area. I was up and out of camp at 7:20am. That is pretty early for me. The morning air was mild and felt amazing. There was a nice light breeze and it was another fantastic day weather wise. It did warm up a bit more today, but with the breeze it just felt so good. I was at the Elkwallow Wayside by 10:30am and met up with a lot of hikers there. Flannel, Star Dust, Chuckles, Fish and Chips, Less Mayo, and Slow Jam just to name a few. I had a good breakfast and then another Blackberry Milkshake. I spent about twenty five bucks. It is like going to a Red Sox game and buying stuff. Crazy over priced but I did not care. It was all very good. This was the last Wayside and tomorrow I will be out of the park. It is an amazing park. I am pretty sure I will be back at some point. The afternoon hike was very nice and my feet felt better. I cut the right boot over my little toe and that seemed to help a lot. My right foot is bigger then my left. I have 9 1/2 boots. My right foot probably needs a 10. My left foot is totally fine. This is the last time I am writing about my feet. I am sick writing about them and I am sure if you read this you must be sick of reading about it. All of us out here have issues, problems, and pains. I am no different then anyone else. So unless my feet are so bad I have to get off the trail you will not be hearing about them. Back to the afternoon hike. I stopped in at a shelter for a break and to get water and met Flannel and Star dust. I seem to be crossing paths with them a lot this week. They are really nice and I like them. After a short visit I was on my way. I had Bear encounter eight and nine around mid afternoon and his time I videoed it. I will put it on Facebook next time I post there. It was a momma and cub. They did not seem to care much about me and they were pretty close to the trail. I saw a number of deer too. You can practically high five then as you walk by. It is crazy. I hiked alone all day and made it to the top of Compton Peak. I hiked twenty miles today, but it is because I hiked for about ten hours not because I hiked fast. I am camping all alone tonight.

I got up this morning and walked over to get it and I noticed it was not up in the air where I hung it. I thought, did a bear get it? Then as I got closer I saw my bag on the ground. It was untouched. I guess I did not tie it up good enough and with the strong winds it must have come untied and fallen down. I felt pretty lucky considering how many bears I have been seeing in this park. I was out of camp at 7:00am. I am getting better at getting up and getting going. I hiked the six plus miles out of the park and into the town of Front Royal. On my morning hike I saw my tenth bear as it jumped out of the bushes in front of me and took off running down the path in front of me. It was trucking. I was impressed with how fast it ran. After that it was just a nice slow hike into town. I am a little sad to be leaving the park because it was just so beautiful, but I am looking forward to the next part of the journey. I hitchhiked into town and am staying at the Quality Inn tonight. Tomorrow I will be back on the trail again. I am tired and an looking forward to sleeping in this nice bed.

There is no way to explain the sounds, the smells, the sites, the way the morning breeze feels as it blows on you all morning. The way that your sweat actually cools you under the forest canopy when that breeze blows on you. It is the coolest thing ever. All of it is just amazing. I was just thinking about this as I hiked today so I figured I would mention it here. Today started out on a very good note. The bed I slept on last night was so comfortable. If I was rich I would have stayed another night. I have spent way more so far on this adventure then I had anticipated. Hopefully I can spend less on the second half of it. I texted with Rucker before leaving for the trail this morning. She is one hundred and fifty miles ahead of me. That is how much ground I lost for being off the trail for a week. I will never catch Her, Forest, Mud puppy, or Slim Rim. That kind of stinks. It was nice to catch up a bit with her. She is an incredibly bright light out here that is for sure. I ended up back on the trail at 11:00am. The hotel shuttled me back to the trail head with Boston, Jersey, and Paul. I would cross paths with them a lot today and took some breaks with them through out the day as well. I also passed Lymme, who I saw way back in the The Grayson Highlands. Nothing too exciting happened today. The hiking was good and the footing was very good. No big views, but the forest is always beautiful. It is really noticeable now when you come out of the forest canopy and into meadows and fields. The temperature rises like twenty degrees. It is hot in that sun compared to being in the shade of the woods. It is always nice to re enter the woods that is for sure. I reached the Dicks Dome Shelter around 6:00pm. Another hiker was coming up from the shelter, which was several tenths of the trail to get to. His name is After and I met him at a shelter a few nights ago. He said all the tent sites were taken and there was a tribe of boy scouts down there as well. I decided not to go down to the shelter and to move down the trail another mile in a half to a campsite. After came as well. We got to the site together well before 7:00pm and set up camp. Lymme also showed up and camped near us. It was another nice day and a great day to be here. Tomorrow is a big milestone day for all the thru hikers who are right around me, as we will reach the 1000 mile mark. It should be another great day. I can not wait.","Front Royal

It did however warm up in the afternoon. I hiked alone and the only person I saw all day was After. I saw him several times as we took breaks. I entered a section of the trailed named The Rollercoaster. It is a thirteen mile stretch of trail with continuous ups and downs of between four hundred and six hundred feet. It is pretty step in places and there is a lot of uneven rocky parts. Like I said earlier it warmed up quite a bit in the morning and I did a ton of sweating. I drank over four litters of water on the day. It was also a milestone day as I passed the 1000 mile mark. I stopped and took a picture and reflected on all those miles. It has been two in a half months and I am still here, still moving north. After I got back going I ran into After again and he said he was staying at The Bears Den Hostel and he had heard a lot of good things about it. I decided part way into the Rollercoaster I did not want to finish it today and I decided to head to the hostel as well. The thought of a shower and a pint of ice cream was too good to pass up. I made it to the hostel at 5:30pm. It is suppose to be nice out so I paid the twelve bucks to tent rather then stay inside in a twenty dollar bunk. Some of the other hikers here are Romeo, Johnny Be Good, ETA, Sole Asylum, Spicy, and Mocho Bear. After a refreshing shower I sat with them and chatted and had my ice cream and watched part of the movie Stripes as my phone charged.

Summer is here and it feels really good at night now. I am starting to like camping a little more now that the warm weather is here. I awoke to the sound of very light rain coming down on my tent. Combined with the mild morning air it was all very soothing. The rain did not last very long and I was up and in the hostel for all you can eat pancakes sometime after 6:00am. I met ETA in the house and he made the pancakes which were very good. All in all this is by far one of the best hostels I have stayed at, plus they were very reasonable with the cost of everything. I was on the trail around 8:00am. It was cloudy, but the air felt amazing. We had a few light showers which also seemed to refresh me more then anything. I finished the last four miles of the Roller Coster and was very glad that was over with. It is just another obstacle completed successfully. The afternoon hike was much easier. My plan was to make it to Harper's Ferry, but I soon realized I could not make it there for early afternoon. I have a lot to do there so I decided to camp a few miles away from town and tomorrow I will spend the better part of the day in town. It is a big day as Harper's Ferry is the unofficial halfway point. They take the halfway picture at the ATC which is really cool. I have to hit the outfitter for a few things along with a trip to the post office. It is a historic town so it would also be nice to just look around at things before heading back out later in the day. I am camping with ETA, Sole Asylum, Jersey, Boston, and Paul.

I was up at 6:00am and had everything loaded by 7:00am. The thunder started as I was packing up and I was wishing I had not already packed up my tent so I could get back in it. Jersey, Boston, and Paul were all still in there tents and the rain was coming. They were going to wait out the rain. They were the smart ones. I headed down the trail as the rain started and I quickly put my rain gear on. It was the first time I have had a chance to use it. I was happy with how it performed. I made the three plus mile trip into Harpers Ferry and arrived at the ATC right at 9:00am. I had my picture taken for there yearbook and I saw Scorpion there which was a total surprise. She is further back on the trail but had gotten off again for another event. I am sure she will catch me quickly when she returns for good. She flies and does big mile days. It was nice to see her and chat a little. After the ATC I spent close to an hour at and outside the post office. I had three big boxes to go though. It all worked out great in the end. I was resupplied thanks to my awesome big brother. I can not thank that guy enough for doing all this resupply stuff for me. After resupplying I had lunch in town before heading back on the trail. It was a very hot and humid day today. The walk along the river was nice and it was flat for three miles but I still sweated like crazy. I debated getting a room and staying in town but in the end I choose the hike north. I hiked up to the first shelter and got there at 3:30pm. The thunder could be heard in the distance. I checked the radar on my phone and decided to move on to the next shelter which was four miles away, but a flat easy hike. The thunder got loader and loader and I picked up my pace. I made it to a beautiful picnic area just as the rain hit. I sat under a huge pavilion and watched the rain and aired out my feet. I would have love to pitch my tent right under that pavilion, but there was a big no camping sign. I waited a half hour for the rain to stop and then hiked the last half a mile to the shelter. Sole Asylum was the only person there. The weather called for severe thunderstorms and two inches of rain so for the second time on my trip I am sleeping in a shelter. It is almost 8:00pm and it is just the two of us. It is now raining like crazy with thunder and lightning. It would be great if no one else showed up, but a lot of times hikers come in late to shelter so we will see. It should be interesting night. The thunder is really load and cracking like crazy! There is one other big thing that happened today. I left Virginia for the last time. All I can say is thank you Virginia. You were awesome. Very hard and very challenging and I feel very rewarded for having hike all the way through you.

I met him several times throughout the Shenandoah's. I did get some sleep, but I did a lot of tossing and turning also. I was up and on the trail a little before 8:00am. I passed by a campground at 11:00am and I talked to Muffin Man, another guy I met in Shenandoah. He said there were free showers with hot water at this campground. I decided to take one even though my clothes were very dirty and I would have to put them back on after. I also was able to take all my gear out of my pack and lay it in the sunshine so it could dry out. It all worked out good. I spent about an hour there and then I was on my way. The theme of the day was historical sites. I passed battlefields from the civil war, plaques along the trail and the first Washington Monument. I felt like I was on a field trip back in school. It was weird. I read all the plaques and walked to the top of the Washington Monument which offered nice views. The afternoon hike was highlighted by several areas with a lot of rocks that were a pain in the butt. I guess it is a good prequel to Pennsylvania, which is well known as the rockiest section of the trail. I hiked alone today and did not see many hikers. That is until I got to the Ensign Cowall Shelter. The place was packed with thru hikers and the shelter was taken up by a group of kids on a field trip or something. I found the last spot and it is pretty slanted. I really like hiking in the evenings, but it makes it hard to find a camp spot sometimes. I am in Maryland now, which is only about forty miles of the trail. In Maryland you have to camp at the shelters or designated campsites. You are not allowed to stealth camp.

For the last few days however the quiet times in the forest are being overtaken by the sounds of nearby roads and highways. Yuck! There have been a ton of road crossings. I am not a big fan of all that. Hopefully it will not last. I passed through Pen Mar County Park around 11:00am. It was big and it was nice. It looked like they were getting ready for a wedding. I stayed there for a half hour on a bench just resting and relaxing. It warmed up quite a bit in the afternoon. The sun was out all day again. I was about three miles from the shelter I am at now when a man in a truck at a road crossing asked me if I would like a ice cream sandwich. I said I sure would. He gave me two. They were really good and I thank him. It is always nice to get a little trail magic near the end of the day.

It is pretty easy to make good time with these conditions even in big clunker boots. I made my way past two parks today. Parks are great because they have bathrooms with running water. It is so nice to just clean my face in the sink and just wash up better in general. I hit the official half way point early in the afternoon. 1094.55 miles. It is hard to believe I have done that many and also hard to believe I have that many more left to do and the hardest parts are yet to come. This is one tough trail. Nothing seems to come easy, but I guesst that makes it what it is and why only twenty five percent or so who start the trail actually finish it. I made my way to the Pine Grove Furnace State Park just before 5:00pm. This is where the famous half gallon ice cream challenge takes place. It was getting to be dinner time so I forgo the challenge and instead had two very big loaded up cheeseburgers. I know I can eat a half gallon of ice cream so to me that is not much of a challenge. If anyone doubts me just ask Val. She is the person who I have shared a house with for the past three years. After I finished eating I went to the lake area and took a free shower. I also washed my gross disgusting shirt in the sink. I am going longer and longer between showers me laundry now. It is just the way it is going to be on the second part of my journey.

However I forgot to dry it out from the last rain event so it was all wet and it smelled really bad. My feet got soaked and my cloths and body no longer felt very clean. The rain only lasted a little over a half hour. I should have checked the weather before I left and then just waited for the rain to pass and then left for the day after the rain stopped. One of these days I may figure this out. The day turned out to be a nice one. Still warm but not as warm as the last few. I am still not feeling quite like myself. Things just feel very different out here since Harpers Ferry. My energy level was low. The terrain however was super easy with a lot of flat walking. I went through a lot of fields and meadows.

I took a bunch of water up to it because I had thoughts of calling it an early day and there is no water at that shelter. When I got there it was only 2:00pm and I seemed to gain a bit of energy. I took a break, had a snack and talked to cousin Jimbo Pierce on the phone. It is always good to talk to him.

I had to re inflate it twice during the night. I was up and on the trail around 7:00am. It was a very odd early morning hike as I had Pete on my mind. I think about him everyday but this morning was something different. It felt like he was here with me and he was helping me down the trail. I decided to use my Nano iPod and listen to some music to keep from hearing the bugs and all the traffic from town. I really enjoyed the music. I have about three thousand songs on it. I have it set to shuffle so I never know what song will play. The second song was from an eighties band named ""The Outfield"" Pete and I would often listen to there songs regularly back in the day. It was surreal and I could not help but get a little emotional. It was only a four mile hike to the town of Duncannon. The trail goes right through the town. I stopped at the Post Office and picked up my bounce box which had my food for the next four days in it. As I walked out of town I enjoyed looking at all the churches and houses. I had a really good vibe about this town. It felt like real America to me. The train went right through town. I just liked it. I also crossed the Sasquehanna River, which I was just totally fascinated by. It was so wide, yet very shallow. It was beautiful in my eyes. The last thing I did before getting back on the trail was to walk about a quarter mile off the trail to a truck stop Subway. It was the best Subway Turkey Club grinder I have ever had. I think I irritated the lady working because I kept saying extra baby spinich, extra tomatos, extra green peppers. Oh and do you have avacodo. She said yes and I said I would like extra of that too. It was awesome. I ate the whole thing with a large Sprite and then I was off and on the trail shortly after 11:00am. I had a short uphill hike to get back up on the ridge line. The weather today was much better with lower humidity and a nice breeze. The terrain was easy as well and I made very good time. I hiked with Joker for a bit until we got to the first shelter. The water in this area is hard to come by. I decided to carry three liters which would last me the rest of the day and night. It made for a rather heavy pack. I also had the four days of food. The easy terrain made it not too bad though. After loading up on water I hiked on alone. I put my iPod back on and was really feeling good and enjoying the afternoon. I stopped several times for breaks and to air out my feet. I met a few new guys. Cherokee, McCuber and ET. I also had my first encounter with a Porky Pine. I was listening to my music when I looked up it was waddling down then path in front of me. I took my phone out and videoed him and then I was on my way.

I was getting water out of a creek and the thing took off in front of me. Scared to living daylights out of me. I got my water and moved on quickly. We also had a late day shower just as I was getting to a bridge crossing. I took advantage and went under the bridge and used the time to make my dinner while it was raining. It was nice to find cover and keep myself and my gear dry. After dinner the rain stopped and I hiked several more miles and I got a decent size climb out of the way coming out of Lickdale. It will be nice not to have to do it first thing in the morning. The rocks of Pennsylvania started yesterday and continued today. They do not seem that bad to me. Maybe it is because I routinely hike Mount Monadnock at home and it is a lot of rock. I am assuming it will get worse. I guess time will tell.","Camp site mile 1162.7

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539722,"I am writing this entry a day late because last night ended up being a late one and I was too tired too write. I ended up hiking around thirty miles however five of those were backtracking up the trail at the end of the day. The rocks, as I expected, got much worse today. They really do slow you down, but I go pretty slow to begin with so it was not that big of a change for me. I also am somewhat accustomed to them because I hike rocky terrain quite a bit back home. I saw my first Pennsylvania bear today. That was exciting. I came out into a clearing and it was checking out a stealth camp site. When it saw me it bolted into the woods. I also saw a half dozen deer and the deer in this state are very big. He was biggest I have seen so far by a lot. I saw a turtle in the trail too. Oh, I also saw bugs, tons of them. They are a big pain. The hiking is not the greatest. I want out of this state. I want mountains, not low rocky ridge lines. I stopped at a shelter around 7:00pm and got water and made my dinner. I carried my dinner out while it was rehydrating. I stopped about fifteen minutes later and ate it and then made my way down another few miles to where I would camp. It was a long day as I hiked well over twenty miles. I took my pack off and went to put my crocks on, but there was only one crock on my pack. I must have lost it when I stopped to eat. Dang! It was 8:00pm and I decided to hike back up two in a half miles and get it. It was there right on the trail and I again made my way back to may camp. I was back around 10:00pm. I was beat and went right to bed. I was very happy to have my crock back though.","stealth site mile 1183.9

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539723,"So today started out with a short but very steep decent into Port Clinton. I went to the Post Office and got my mail. There were two other hikers doing the same thing. One Feather and Mountain Girl, both super nice. One Feather had way to much food so he was giving stuff away. Mountain Girl was sending her tent home and was going to just use a tarp. I ended up hitchhiking into Hamburg with Mountain Girl. She is from Australia. We went to the worlds biggest Cabbalas. I ended up buying my seventh pair of hiking shoes. Salomon high top hiking boots. My right foot was getting destroyed because it did not fit properly. They were good though as they helped my feet through some other issues. I left Mountain Girl at the store as she was staying in town. I got some lunch at an all you can eat Asian restaurant and then I hitched back to the trail. I was hiking just after 1:00pm. I made my way about five miles before I stopped to get some water. I was also at that time thinking I had to figure out a better way to strap my crocks to my pack. I took my pack off and my heart sank as I only had one crock again. I meant to figure out a way to secure it earlier but then I ended up going into town and then I just forgot. Pretty stupid on my part. There was no back tracking this time. It could have been all the way back at Cabbalas for all I knew. I wanted to just leave the other one right there on the ground, but that would make me a bad hiker, so I still have the one and will get rid of it when I find a trash. I got to my camp are around 7:30pm and set up my tent and stuff and realized all my electrical stuff was missing. All my external chargers and cords. I unpacked everything at the post office and must have forgot to repack that. I am pretty bummed. I am just not that good at this. It really makes me wonder what I am doing. I am just throwing away money everyday because I keep making mistakes. It is killing me. I hope I feel better tomorrow. I probably need a day off the trail to recharge a bit.","stealth site at 1210.7

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539805,"I woke up this morning and pretty much decided that I have had enough of the AT. It has beaten me down in a lot of ways and I am really tired and for some reason really lacking in energy. I am feeling sluggish and clumsy. I sure in the heck am not going to stop in the middle of Pennsylvania though. No way! I will finish this state in the next few days and then I am going home. I will finish the trail in sections over the coming years. I guess there is always the outside chance I could return this year, but that would only happen with a clean bill of health from my doctor and a foot specialist. I also would have to be totally sure that I had found the correct foot ware for my feet. If I did give it one more shot this year I think I would flip flop and go to Maine and work my way back down to New Jersey. I had a tough morning as I made this decision. I have been thinking about it for a few days. I stopped for a break around 10:30 am and really felt sick by the whole situation. I know I have made many mistakes and I try to listen to listen to people who want to help. I just do not know how to hear people. I feel really stupid sometimes because I can not understand and put into action things that will help me out. It is kind of a life long thing I have always struggled with and it is different then general stubborness. So back to my hike today. After I got through having a pity party for myself I ended up having a pretty darn good day. I stopped by the Elkhart Shelter for water and there were several other people there. I dropped my bag and said hello. After a few minutes I started looking around for my crock to see if by chance someone dropped it off there. This is one of the few shelters that is right on the road so you can actually drive to it. As I looked around I did not see anything, then I saw a hiker cabinet so I opened it and low and behold my crock was right there. I could not believe it. I grabbed it and started telling two other hikers this story when another hiker names Grubb said she had picked it up and carried it the last fifteen miles. I gave her a hug and thanked her repeatedly. I then figured out a way to secure it to my pack. I sure am glad I had not gotten rid of the one I was carrying. It was all just too crazy, but me and my crocks are now reunited again. I left soon after for my afternoon hike. This state is incredibly frustrating with unmaintained trails, poison ivy everywhere, the endless rocks, water that is incredibly hard to come by, and the high population of rattlesnakes on this part of the trail. I was unfortunate enough to encounter two rattlesnakes on the trail today. One big one and a mile later a small one. Not much will grab your attention quicker then the rattle of a rattlesnake. You have to really be careful and wait for them to get well off the path before passing by, at least I do. I hiked all day and only saw a few people. A lot of people have dropped out from what people have told me. For me this has been the hardest state by far for all the reasons above and other reasons as well, like the excessive heat and humidity and the stalking bugs right in your eyes and ears. I smell so bad and a shower does not do much to help because within twenty minutes you are all stinky and sweaty all over again. I just sweat my butt off all day. My pack is so gross. There is also just nothing here that is captivating. It is all blaa and uninviting. I ended up making my way to a restaurant around 3:00pm. It is right at a road crossing. I had a huge cheeseburger and fries and they were both delicious. I even got to watch the part of the nascar race while I was there. I finished up there and was back on the trail by 4:00pm. I hiked on until about 8:30pm where I am camped now. Tomorrow is another huge challenge day. No water source close to the trail for like twenty miles and a really big one thousand food ascent up a massive boulder field. I want to thank everyone for the kind messages you have sent my way. I have loved hearing from you all. I feel good about my decision and really think it is in my best interest to step away at this time. I have had a wonderful experience and I absolutely love the Southern Appalachians Mountains. It was everything I hoped for and even more.","stealth site 1229.4

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540064,"Up and out of camp around 7:00am. As I got started I was concerned with the water situation for the day. I had carried three liters from the restaurant to my campsite last night and I did not cook a hot dinner because I did not want to use the water. I left camp this morning with a liter to get me to the one reasonable water source for the day. To me walking one to two miles round trip down a steep hill for water is not reasonable. I arrived at the water source mid morning and drank down two liters. I did not know that was possible, but believe me, it is. I then packed up and carried four liters to get me through the day and coming night and following morning. That is around nine pounds of water. Not good, but this is the option I chose. I hiked on and it was a really nice day. I climbed up a steep incline and it was rocky and exposed. It was really fun and made me feel like I was hiking the way I like to hike. At points you had to use your hands to get up and over the boulder type obstacles. After the climb I was on an exposed ridge line looking down into a town. It did not take long for me to run into some black raspberry bushes with ripe berries. I stopped and ate a bunch and they were so good. I walked a little more and their were more bushes, so I ate more. It kept happening for around a half mile. It was awesome. It was nice to have a little sun exposure today and get out of all the bugs. It was still hot, but not too bad. There was a nice breeze which also added to the pleasantness of the day. I hiked on and encounter lots and lots of rocks. They are so frustrating. Around 3:00pm the clouds moved in and it started raining soon after. I arrived at the shelter at 6:00pm. I decided to hike on and hope it would stop raining. I made it another three miles and the rain did indeed stop. I stopped for the night around 7:45pm and I stealth camped. I had not drunk as much water as I anticipated so I was able to have a hot dinner. A little over sixteen miles tomorrow and I am out of this awful rock ridden state. I am so glad I am finishing this state though because I do not think I would have ever come back. We just did not see eye to eye at all.","stealth caml mile 1251.8

It was strange knowing this would be my last day doing this for at least at least the foreseeable future if not for good. I was on the trail at 5:45am. The earliest I have ever started. I was glad to get moving because my cloths were damp and my boots were soaked from all the hiking in the rain yesterday. I made my way down to Wind Gap and then right back up the hill out of Wind Gap. This would be my last good climb for the day. I still battled the rocks all day, but I just kept counting down the miles. 16, 15. 14, etc. I ran into another thru hiker. Her name is Trotter. She is a sixty three year old women and super nice. We hiked together for an hour or so before she moved on. I stopped at the last shelter of the day for a break. I did a lot of soul searching and thinking about my future on the trail. I would like to get back on in a few weeks after some rest and a trip to the foot doctor. I love the idea of going to Maine now and working my way south to New Jersey. I guess time will tell. I ended up hiking into Delaware Water Gap at around 2:30pm. I was pretty excited to have finished Pennsylvania. I stopped at the church hostel and took a long very overdue shower. I then went and got a ice cream and walked down to the Delaware River bridge and all the way out of Pennsylvania just to make it official that I finished the whole state. I then walked back to the hostel where I found my dad waiting for me. I got my pack and we headed for home. It took four plus hours to get home. It was very strange driving back into Mass. It did not feel right. I am in my bed now and it does not feel right either. I need to find the right pair of hiking shoes and get back on the trail. My cousin Jimbo has some ideas on shoes so I am going to check that out. I will be off line here until a final decision is made about my thru hike for this year. I do plan on taking at least two weeks off for rest no matter what though. I have plenty of time still and can afford to take this time to rest and heel, especially because I most likely will be hiking south out of Maine.

Tomorrow I will be hiking Mount Katahdin and then I will head south on the AT into the 100 mile Wilderness. I am very excited and so ready to be back on the trail. I have had two appointments with my foot doctor and have been giving the OK to start hiking. I am hopeful I can incorporate his advice as well. I need to do less miles, take more breaks, and take more zero days and if my feet start acting up I need to stop and rest them. I am hopeful being in Maine will help as well. It is much more remote here and this is what I truly love about hiking. The Mid Atlantic states are not very appealing to me and I was definitely going too fast because I wanted out of that part of the trail. I also have new boots that I am hopeful will work out. I do not know how far or how long I will hike. I am hopeful that I can make it all the way to New Jersey where I left off, but for now my goal is to summit Katahdin and make it through the 100 mile wilderness. I will have been off the trail for 18 days now. It has been tough. I have had to stay off my feet quite a bit and have felt very anxious. It was pretty clear from the time I got home that I was not ready to re enter the real world. The trail is where I belong and the trail is where I hope to be for the next few months. Being home was not all bad though. I ate a lot. I put on most of the weight that I had lost. I got to visit with most of my family and see some close friends. I made four trips to my brothers which meant I got to ride up and down I495 in my car four times with all my window down and sunroof open. I just love that with the music playing. Those rides were the most relaxing part of my few weeks off. I went shooting with my dad a few times. I got caught up on a few TV shows. I went to Newburyport and Plum Island one afternoon, which was really relaxing. I also spent a few days back at the hospital working to help train a new employee in Cat Scan. It was nice to see all my co workers. All the people at the hospital are so nice. I spent the July 4th with my sister, Kyle,and Bennett at Sunapee beach. That was so relaxing I fell asleep three times on the beach. I also took a bike ride out into the Quabin to one of my favorite spots. So all and all I did do some fun things, but through it all I still felt I was not really where I was suppose to be. So now I am here at the Hostel. It was really cool when I got here I was greeted by Duffy and Mighty Mouse who also greeted me at the Hostel in Dohlonega Georgia, which is the hostel I stayed at the night before my first day on the trail way back in March. I also went and talked to a few other hikers who were finishing up there northbound hike. Come Back Kid and Nowa in particular. Nowa is a 55 year old guy who left Georgia two weeks before me on March 14th and he finished today. That is crazy fast. We talked quite a bit about his journey. On a very sad note I learned earlier that a co worker of mine lost her mother in a bad accident. She has been in my thoughts all day and I am praying for her and her entire family.

I was up at 5:00am as it gets light really early this far north. Carl, Preston, Becky, Kristina, and I left the hostel at 6:30 for Baxter State Park. We checked in and got hiking around 8:00am. The weather all week said today was going to be sunny with no rain.....until yesterday they changed it to rain and thunderstorms. Bummer. It was overcast but not raining as we left and the rain was suppose to start around 11:00am. I really wanted to just take my time and go slow, but with the forecast the way it was I found myself hiking up the mountain fairly quickly. It was a difficult hike that was very vertical at times. Much of the middle third of the hike you had to use your hands along with your feet to get up and over boulders. It was fun going up, but I knew going back down would be a much bigger challenge and more difficult. I was able to get some really incredible views as the trail moved above the tree line. However that did not last long. As I finished the uphill Boulder scrambling and made my way into the flats the trail entered the clouds and that is how it stayed all the way to the summit. I made it there in three hours and twenty minutes. I took a few pictures and ate a few bars and then started back down the trail. It was cool and windy so I was getting cold and had to get moving. The hike back down was indeed much more difficult then going up. I had no choice but to take my time and go slow. The rain held off until I got through the boulder field. I got wet but not soaked through. I made it to camp at 3:30pm. My legs were fatigued as this is the first hiking I have done in seventeen days.

The trail followed a large swift moving stream that was just picture perfect to look at. The trail itself was beautiful. I am loving all the hemlock and green moss everywhere and it all smells amazing. I was getting tired before I finished those nine miles so I found a nice grassy spot next to the river and took a nap while laying on my Tyvek ground sheet. It was so relaxing. I am still breaking in my new boots so my feet were feeling fatigued all day, but in a good normal way. They seem to be doing a good job supporting my feet, which is critical. After my nap I made my way all the way out of the park to the Abol Campground. They served food there so I ordered a burger and fries and then had an awesome blackberry vanilla swirl with dark chocolate chuck ice cream cone. It was so freaking good. After lunch I crossed Abol bridge and entered the 100 mile wilderness. I took my time hiking all day and stopped at several Rapids and Falls. During the afternoon it rained for and hour or so, but like yesterday, I did not get soaked through. I am looking forward to some sunny days. It has been good hiking weather though. I was expecting the bugs to be really bad up here, but apparently the black fly season is over and the mosquitos have not been bad at all yesterday or today. I am not sure what to make of it. I sure as heck am not complaining that is for sure, especially when I hear how bad the hikers are having it down in Massachusetts and Connecticut right now with the bugs and humidity. My mood kind of soured during the afternoon with the rain and with my feet and legs hurting. All those days I took off made it so basically I am starting with non hiking legs. I could feel hot spots in my feet and toes so I kept stoping and resting. I do not want any blisters. I can not wait until these boot are broken in. My energy level was way down also, which was discouraging. I was planning on stopping for the day at the first shelter 13 miles in. However thunder in the area had me picking up my pace and I arrived there at 3:00pm. It was a small older shelter in a very dark forest. No one was there and I did not like it. I took a break there and decided to hike five more miles to a lake that was listed on my guide book. It was a very slow pace and I was not very comfortable but in the end it was totally worth it. I arrived at the lake a little after 6:00pm. I found three people at a campsite right on the lake. There was plenty of room so I set my tent up and stay there. The other hikers here are Annie and Ted, who are together and from Pennsylvania and Chris. She is from Wisconsin. She is hiking southbound while Ted and Annie are sectioning northbound. All super nice. I chatted with Chris for a long time before I decided it was time for my first AT swim and boy was it awesome. The name of this lake is Rainbow Lake and it is huge and incredibly beautiful and I am tenting right on its shore. It is amazing. I ended up hiking over 18 miles today.

Cooler and dryer air had moved in and it felt great. The sun was out and reflecting off the lake. I took my time getting up and getting out of camp. I chatted with Chris for a while which was nice. It felt like I was leaving really late but when I checked the time as I left it was only 6:45am. The time thing up here is really throwing me off. Today I hiked next to some form of water practically all day. The streams are so beautiful and the lakes and ponds with nothing but the wilderness surrounding them are just awesome. It was a cooler dryer day today so I opted not to swim even though I passed many great spots to do so. I stopped at the first shelter and ran into a NOBO (northbound hiker) His name is Clemintine. He will be summiting tomorrow. He started on March 26th. That is two days before I started!! That is crazy. He was really good to talk to and a super nice guy. It has been great talking to all the NOBO's. I get a lot of information about what is a head of me in terms of terrain and the best campsites. They have been great. I met a young male hiker named Chris(different from the female Chris from last night and this morning) this morning who was just starting out southbound to do the 100 mile wilderness. He is only twenty years old and very polite. I passed him a second time this afternoon and he said he was done and was going home. It was just was not for him. I talked to him for a bit and then hiked on. He is tenting next to me tonight and will be making his way back to Baxter starting tomorrow. We talked and hung around the fire for a bit before he headed to bed. I also met another flip flop hiker like me here at the shelter. Her name is Zero's. She seems very nice and we also chatted quite a bit. I helped her get firewood so we could have a small fire which was nice. The scenery here continues to amaze me. It is really beautiful.

I just floated around for a half hour and then sat on the beach area for another half hour. I felt so invigorated when I got back on the trail. I hiked next to a lot of water all day again. My brother would love this part of the trail. It would be fun to do it with him some day. There are so many great places to camp right next to lakes and rivers. I just love it all. I continue to pass NOBO's who are flying bye me. It is nice to see them when they are taking a break or at camp because then we can talk longer. Many of them just want to be done and get to Katahdin so it is a quick hi and then they are off. I am liking this new pace I using. I am hiking a lot slower and taking many breaks. I also am taking many side trails to see views and wild beaches. I have been soaking my feet in stream and lakes everyday too. I saw two NOBO's at the first shelter. Apple and Crispy and I am camping tonight with another flip flopper named Faceplant. He has hiked from Harpers Ferry to here.

It is on a peninsula so we can see the sunset and sunrise over the lake. I hiked a short day and got here at 3:30pm. No one was here when I arrived. The first thing I did was jump in the lake and again I just floated around. I then laid on my tyvek and dried off and just relaxed.

The sunrise was so nice and it was another perfect morning. The weather has been more then I could have hoped for. I left the campsite around 7:30 am. I have been waking up at 5:00am and really taking my time and enjoying the morning much more then I was when I was down south. It was a sunny day but it did warm up a bit more. It might have reached 80. I hiked to the first shelter where there was at huge set of falls with a big swimming pool at the bottom. I dropped my gear and cloths and in I went. It was really cold compared to all the lakes I have been swimming in, but it still felt really good and it refreshed me for my afternoon hike. I met a bunch of really nice NOBO's there as well. A few of them were trying to catch trout with there head net. I saw a dozen or so NOBO's on the day. During my afternoon hike I encountered my first trail magic in the form of a sealed large container full of crackers, chips, Oreos, and other assorted snacks. It was very nice to come upon it. It was put there by Boy Scout troup number 61 out of Wrentham, Mass. So a big thank you to them. I sat and had snacks there with a NOBO named Lost Pony. He was a cool dude and it was good to chat with him as we snacked. I made my way to my resupply spot in the woods after moving on from the trail magic. I had a map and had to find my five gallon pale of food which was hidden in the woods. It was kind of fun to find it. What was not fun was putting that ten plus pounds of food in my pack and then immediately have to climb a decent hill. I am planning on taking my time and doing shorter mile days so that means I need more food to get to my resupply points. I reached the East Branch Lean-to around 4:30 pm. My feet were starting to ache so I stopped for the day and made camp here. There are seven of us here tonight. Shepard, Nancy, Jean, Jorden, Nan, Afterburner, and Beth. Five of these folks are in there sixties and are out here and loving it. I think that is awesome. We all ate and chatted at the shelter. Jorden found a really good swimming hole down stream from our water supply spot so we both took a dip there and got all cleaned up. It has been so nice to be able to stay so clean while doing all this hiking. It just did not happen down south like this. I love it. I love Maine. We do have some rain in the forecast the next few days so let's see how I feel after that. Tomorrow is also the first major mountain I have to hike. White Cap Mountain. It is about a 2400 foot ascent and it is pretty vertical. I will start to get into more and more mountains from here on out. My energy level is still not where I think it should be. Hopefully it will improve soon. Either way I will just keep putting one foot in front of the other and carrying on.","Antlers Campsite

It felt really strange like it was 5:00pm not 5:00am. When I was packing up I lost a tent stake somehow. I looked everywhere for it but it was no where. I was doing so good not losing things too. Oh well. I left camp at 7:00am and had another really good hike. The scenery continued to impress. I went right up my first big climb as I summited White Cap mountain which stands at 3650 feet high. I then hiked Hey Mountain and West peek. I was at the second shelter of the day at 3:00pm and felt good so I decided to hike five in a half miles to a campsite right on Pleasant River where there was good swimming. About a mile into the five mile hike it started thundering in in the distance. I decided to see if I still had thru hiker pace and took off at over three miles an hour. It went ok for about three miles then my feet got fatigued so I backed it back down. It sprinkled but never did rain hard. I made it to my camp spot around 5:30pm. I set up quickly as the weather looked ominous. After I was set up I went in the river and got cleaned up. It felt soooo good. It is so nice to be clean every night after hiking and sweating all day. It has been quite a treat. I am going to enjoy it while I can because I know down the road it will not be this way. There are two other people here with me tonight. Wendy and Wendy. They are friends who are hiking the 100 mile wilderness together. Overall another great day with great views atop White Cap. I did manage to fall and break one of my trekking poles this afternoon. I was able to gerry rig it so it works for now. The bottom shaft broke but I was able to slide it up the sleeve of the middle section and make the upper section longer. I will probably need I new pair. I will be in Monson Sunday or Monday and out of the 100 mile wilderness. This place has been great so far and just what I needed. Severe storms in the forecast for tonight. It should be interesting. Beaver just called out my name in the dark outside my tent. I spent a lot of my first day and night with him. He has caught up to me after leaving Katahdin a day after me. He also had my lost tent stake. Apparently he passed Shepard on the trail who found it and she gave it to him in hopes he would see me. The people out here amaze me. Everyone has been awesome. I really like the amount of people on the trail right now. I am optimistic it will continue to be good even when the NOBO bubble come through. I mean only the toughest of the tough will have made it all the way up here. It continues to be cool to see and talk to the NOBO's when I get a chance.,"East Branch Lean-to

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543354,"I woke up this am at 5:00am which has been pretty standard all week. We did not get the storms or rain that was predicted for the overnight, which was good. I did not sleep as well last night. I have no idea why, but I was excited because I knew today I was going to be hiking mountain and they would have a lot of views. I have loved being on the floor of the forest for the first four days, but now it is time to start really hiking. Today did not disappoint. I was out of camp at 7:30am. I stopped and said hi to Beaver who was camped just up the trail from where I was. I was a little sluggish to start the day. It was uphill to Chairback Mountain. When I did get up on top there were great views to the east and north and I found a bunch of wild blueberries which was a nice treat. The rest of the day was up and down smaller but tough mountains. Columbus Mountain, Third Mountain, Mount Three in a half, and Forth Mountain. I took lunch at Third Mountain where there were cliffs and incredible views in every direction. I stayed there for an hour. It was so peaceful and beautiful. No houses, no roads, no societal noises, just mountains, forest and lakes as far as you could see. As the afternoon progressed I started hearing thunder in the distance just like yesterday. I quickly hiked over the last two mountains and made it to Cloud Pond Lean-to at 3:30pm. The pond was huge and more like a lake. I found the perfect spot for my tent with a perfect view of the lake. I then jumped in the lake and as has been the case all week, it felt incredibly refreshing. I am here tonight with a whole bunch of people. A group of kids are occupying the shelter and all us hikers are down by the pond. I have been conversing with Beaver, Jay, Wendy and Wendy for the most part, but I did meet T who is a NOBO and talked to him for a bit too. This pond is absolutely gorgeous and now all the frogs are chirping very loudly. It is pretty cool. Today I only hiked 11.2 miles as I am trying to not over do it. I have plenty of food left so I think I will do another short day tomorrow and then go into Monson on Monday.","Pleasant river campsite

There was a crispness in the air as cooler dryer air moved in overnight. I actually had to put my down jacket on. I ate my breakfast down by the shore as the sun was shining brightly across it. It was beautiful. I then finished packing while chatting with Wendy for a bit before heading out of camp around 8:00am. I hiked through more pine, hemlock and spruce forest. The smells continue to be heavenly. The forest floor in these area is covered in a carpet on green moss. It looks like it is right out of a fairy tale at times. It is so nice. The forest led me to the top of Barren Mountain which had a old fire tower structure, but with no building on top. The ladder rungs were still on it so I climbed up to the top and had an incredible 360 degree view of the wilderness and lakes. It was amazing. It was sunny and clear which makes all the difference. During the afternoon the landscape changed to a more hardwood forest which also was super nice to walk through. The sunlight shining through reminded me of being on Mount Wachusett from back home which is a beautiful mountain. I had to ford my second river this afternoon. I walked way up stream to try and find a place to rock hop but there was not a place so I took my boots off and zipped off my lower legs on my pants and made my way across. I crossed paths with Beaver, Wendy, and Wendy several times throughout the day as well as a half dozen NOBO's. I got to my camp spot around 5:00pm. After hiking 12.5 miles. Jay was here already and Wendy and Wendy showed up after me so it is the four of us here tonight. We are at a site that has a huge waterfall. It has to be fifty feet high or higher. It has a great swimming hole at the bottom and we all went in. It was awesome and felt amazing. So again tonight for the seventh night in a row I am going to bed clean. Ahhh, hiking life is so good this week. It has been the best week ever. Jay, Wendy and Wendy will finish the wilderness tomorrow so I will not be seeing them anymore. They have been great company. I have 6.5 miles into Monson and will probably get back on the trail Tuesday. It will most likely be back to normal hiking with only occasional lakes and swimming holes at the end of the day. I can hear the sound of the falls from inside my tent. It is pretty darn soothing. It should make for a great night.","Cloud Pond Lean-to

On the one hand I was going to be in town by noon and get to reset and resupplied for the next five days. I am excited that I am moving forward and doing so well. On the other hand I am sad to be leaving this magical land. It has been one of the best weeks of my life so in a lot of ways I wish it would never end. Everything just went my way. The weather, the people, the campsites, the amazing terrain and landscapes. I thought it would be good, but had no idea how good. So I was up at 5:30am. I said good bye to Jay, Wendy and Wendy. I am going to miss them. It would not surprise me if they all end up doing this whole trail at some point in the future. I left camp at 7:00am and made it out of the 100 mile wilderness and to the major road at 10:30am. I decided to hike the next three miles to another road where you can get into Monson. I have been told by some of the NOBO's some of the hikers skip this three mile section, but I really would like to do all the miles so there will be no skipping for me. I reached the road at noon and went to call the free shuttle that would come get me if I stayed at their hostel. The only problem was there was no cell service. I had hiked pretty hard so I could get into town early. I was bummed. It was a back dirt road with hardly any traffic. I had 1.7 miles to walk into town. It was hot and road walking is very hard on the feet compared to the trail. So I headed down the road towards Monson. I walked for 15 minutes and no cars. Finally a car came from behind headed towards town. The cars travel slowly on this road so I kind of stepped into to road and waved the car down. He stopped and I asked him for a ride. I practically forced him to stop. He was really nice and gave me a ride. His name is Tom and he is from the area. I was so appreciative. I got dropped off at the Lake House hostel. I decided to get a private room and it ended up facing the lake with two big windows. It is really nice. It also has a tv in the room with cable and I am watching the Red Sox right now as I write this. I did hiker chores this afternoon and I have been out to eat twice. I also brought my trekking poles to the other hiker hostel in town called Shaws and the guy there fixed my poles by giving me a new bottom section on one of my poles which had snapped in half and I also had both of my broken tips replaced. He was awesome and so helpful. So I am good to go with all my equipment in tack now. My plan is to head out in the morning after getting a big town breakfast. I am feeling great and looking forward to all the days ahead and to all the new people I will meet.","Little Wilsons Falls

It was nice to wake up to the lake breeze coming in the windows. I had breakfast at Pete's Place next door. It was really good. I ordered blueberry pancakes and they were huge. They were so big I could not finish the two that I got. After I ate the folks who run the hostel brought me back to the trailhead. The morning hike was peaceful as I only saw a few people. You could tell I was out of the 100 mile wilderness. I kind of miss Jay, Wendy and Wendy. I thought about them and how nice they were. I wish we would have exchanged information so I could contact them. I told Wendy about my journal so maybe she will leave a comment when she reads it. So back to the hike today. It was mostly flat terrain and I noticed a few more bugs early on, but as the day went on they seemed to disappear. I met up with Beaver in the afternoon and we pretty much hiked together the rest of the day. We reached the first shelter which was on a lake at 3:30pm. My original plan was to stay there. The lake was all weeds and the water had a lot of debris in it. I was low on water and did not like the way the water looked. We decided to hike up and over Moxie Bald to the next shelter area which was four miles away. It was about a 1000 foot climb, but we were rewarded around the top with loads of wild blueberries. We kept stopping and picking and eating them by the handfuls. They were so freaking good. The top of Moxie Bald offered stunning views and a nice breeze which felt amazing. It was a pretty warm day today with temperatures in the eighties. We eventually headed down the mountain to our campsite. We got hear a little after 7:00pm. There was just enough time to set up my tent, collect water, and then make dinner. There is a couple from England hear tonight and it is there one year anniversary. There names are Chris and Hannah. They are really nice. There is also a NOBO, Clean Skittle. We ate together and exchanged trail information before we all headed to bed. I hiked 18.7 miles today.

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543765,"I was up and out of camp around 7:30am after another good night sleep. The nights have been really comfortable which is nice. I remember the freezing cold nights in April down south. I hated them. This is much better. I had a short day planned and it turned out to be another fantastic day up here in Maine. I made good time hiking up Pleasant Mountain. I hit the jackpot on a bunch of blueberry bushes again today and again I spent around 45 minutes picking and eating them. So good! The summit was nice and I had lunch up on it. I made my way down to the shelter around 2:30pm. The shelter and the area gave me a bad feeling so I was unsure weather to stay or not. There was a lake beach about a quarter mile away and it was pretty warm today. There were two people at the shelter, both SOBO's. Lee and Eastwood who I had met earlier on the trail. They watched my pack and I went to the lake to take a dip. It felt great to jump in. The lake was big, but was surrounded by houses. We are not in the 100 Mile Wilderness anymore. I made my way back to the shelter and looked around some more. I made a stop at the Privy and it was the grossest one I have seen yet. It was full to the top and there were big spiders in their as well. After that I knew I had to go so I packed up my stuff and said good bye to Lee and Eastwood and headed south on the trail. It was only six miles to Caratunk and there is a hostel there. Right after that is the ferry crossing of the Kennebec River. It only runs until 2:00pm so Caratunk is as far as I could go. I looked for a good stealth spot along the way but never found anything so I went to the hostel. Turns out it was full, but the guy let me tent in the back, which was really nice of him. I took a shower and then I ate a big Cheeseburger he made me. After dinner I spent an hour talking to a couple who were thru hiking north. Zin Master and Pants. They were so nice and they gave me a lot of good information and we exchanged trail stories. Pants hip is really hurting her. I hope it gets better. They are so close to finishing.

I sat in the kitchen with him to eat because the dining room table was full. The food was excellent. I stayed until about 8:45am because the ferry accross the Kennebec River did not start until 9:00am. Lee showed up at the Hostel a little after 8:00am and Paul gave her a big plate of breakfast left overs. It was not a fancy place, but I really liked it. It had a ton of character. I eventually did head down to the ferry and made it accoss quickly. It was a later start then usual. I hiked to the first shelter and had a quick break before heading back on the trail. The trail followed a swift moving stream/river. It had some waterfalls and it was just nice to look at while hiking. I made my way by another lake. It had a nice beach and if storms were not in the forcast I would have gone for a swim. It was probably the hottest and humidest day so far. I wanted to get to the next shelter and set up before any rain and storms came through. I barely made it as it started raining just as I arrived. I got my tent up quickly and got all my stuff inside. The rain did not last very long which was nice. This shelter is right on a big lake. After I collected my water for the night I went swimming to clean all the slime off my body. As usual it felt awesome. I met a new SOBO named Charles. Lee is also here but she went to her tent very early. I also spent much of the time talking with a few section hikers, Mary and Spiraea. They are mother and daughter and were fun to chat with. There is also a large group of kids here. They are from Camp Kieve. I hope they are not up late and being loud. It was a nice atmosphere at the shelter area. We did get a group of NOBO's stop by for a bit and wait out the second good rain shower. This one lasted a bit longer.

It was also the warmest night so far, almost too warm. I said good bye to Mary and Spirea, who are both super nice and then I hit the trail. I had two small climbs and two large climbs on the day. I also hiked along Flagstaff Lake. It was really beautiful. I did pretty good with the ups and downs. I met a NOBO at the lake. Her name is Just Right. She had just finished swimming. We chatted for a while before I headed for the Bigelows. The Bigelows are a mountain range with some big beautiful mountains. I went up Little Bigelow without any problems. It was another three miles to Avery Peak. This was a two mile climb and almost two thousand feet of climbing. The mountain itself is over 4000 feet. I slowly made my way up. It was a tough climb but I made it up in less then two hours. The views were the best so far. I can not believe this state just gets better and better! The views looking down on Flaggstaff lake were out of this world. I stayed at the summit for about an hour and I was the only one there for a good 45 minutes. I loved it. I then made my way down a few hundred feet to Avery Campsite. The campsite is 3800 feet up and it is much cooler up here. I got here around 6:30pm and I set up and made dinner. I got cold eating. It is going to be a chilly night, thankfully I have some cold weather gear with me. I will be in Stratton tomorrow. I have to pick up my food drop.

Eastwood showed up after dark last night and he left at the same time as I did. I had a quick hike up Bigelow Mountain West Peak and then up South Horn. The views were great, but it was really windy and cool. I made my way down out of the mountain range to the roadside around noon. I tried hitching into town and was having no luck. I then saw a car pulling out of the trailhead. I waved him over and talked him into giving me a ride Stratton where my food drop was. I got dropped off at the Motel Hostel in town. l and met about eight SOBO's which was good. Possible company on the trail in the near future. Everyone seemed nice and I gave away some items I did not need to some of them. I resupplied and then headed out to get lunch. I had some pizza and Gatorade before easily getting a hitch back to the trail. I hiked up North Crocker and South Crocker Mountains. South Crocker was five miles long and almost 3000 feet of elevation gain. The Mountain itself stood at over 4200 feet. It was sad when I got to the top though because all it was was a pile of rocks surrounded by hemlock trees. No views. Bummer. I made my way to the Crocker Cirque Campsite around 7:00pm. I ate my dinner with a NOBO named Clothesline. There are a bunch of others here but they are all keeping to themselves. It is the start of the big mountains in Maine. It is going to be pretty tough from now until I get out of New Hampshire. It is around 200 miles of big mountain and big climbs and descents.

It feels good though. Several times today I just stopped in the forest and listened to nothing and deeply breathed the fresh mountain air in and out. The forest was so still and peaceful. I love quiet. Later in the day I ran into Echo on the trail today. I last saw her in Tennessee at the Mountain Laurel Hostel and B&B. At least that is what I think it was called. We were in a four bed bunk room. She was doing 25 plus mile days back then and I was not. I remember it being very pleasant talking with her back then. She remembered me and we chatted for ten minutes or so. She slowed dramatically once she hit the whites and she still has not picked back up her pace. I can not believe how fast she got up here. She is the first one that I have known that I have run into. Rucker is only a few days from me. I hope I get to see her when we cross each other. I ended up hiking about 17 miles today.

All and all a rough day on the trail. The weather continues to be stellar, which is a big plus.

Tonight I am in a great spot next the a good stream, but I kind of wish there were other people here to converse with. It is kind of funny because when I started in Georgia I wanted to be away from people and it was impossible because there were so many, now I wish a had people, and there are far fewer. Today I only saw a handful of hikers. I will be in the Whites soon and I am sure there will be too many people there. So maybe that will be good for me.

I hiked over 4200 feet in elevation today between both mountain ranges. Like I noted, the views were great and Mount Washington loomed in the distance. I huffed and puffed most of the day and sweated what seemed like gallons. I drank over five liters of water. I stopped a lot and took in the views and enjoyed the quiet a top the mountains.

It is very treacherous. I took extreme care in each step and made it down without incident. It was late when I got to camp, but all I had to do was get my tent up and get in because I had already ate my dinner. It was a a hard day, but a good day.

Tomorrow I start the Whites. I am excited, but it is more hard climbs, but even longer ones then I have been doing. It was good to get off my feet this afternoon. I hope the rest, and the fact that I have been eating all day helps me get up into those big mountains in the morning with some good energy.","Gentian Pond Shelter and Campsite

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544986,Today I opted to hike northbound. The hostel shuttled a bunch of us to Pinkham Notch and I set out from there. There are several very steep climbs and it is strongly encouraged to go up them and not down them. So that is why I did it this way. The hiking was really good today and the weather was much cooler and felt great. I stopped at the Carter Hut and they fed me left over scrambled eggs and then chocolate cake after. The cake was awesome. I took my time on the two big climbs and really enjoyed looking over at the presidential range all day. The view form Mount Hight was fantastic. I was going to split this range into two days but I felt so good I did all twenty one miles today. I am back at the hostel now and looking forward to starting the presidentials tomorrow. I am pretty tired so that is it for tonight.,"Gorham, NH

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545121,"I started my hike of the presidential range today. I was excited to get going. My pack was a bit heavier then usual with five days of food on board. The first five miles were moderate and easy going. I ran into Forest, then Odisius, and then Sprinkle Toes. I hiked and camped with all of them down south on multiple occasions. It continues to be nice running into people from when I was down south. I spent one of the best camping nights with Forest and a few others on a mountain top ridge in Virginia. The sunset that night was one of the best. After all my run ins I soon had to start the 3000 foot climb up Mount Madison. It was tough, but I just went slow and steady and soon enough I was above tree line. The wind was crazy. It was practically blowing me over. I have never hiked in winds this hard and steady. It was slow going. I made it to Madison Hut around 3:00pm. I was very tired and asked to do work for stay. They said eventually yes and I spent the next hour or so washing dishes. I am here with Bear Bag. Forest Gump, Pumpkin, and a few others. All nice people. We have been sitting here most of the evening just talking. We were given the left overs for dinner which was awesome. We are all sleeping on the floor in the dinning area tonight. It is still so crazy windy outside. I am very great full to be inside and nice and warm. It would not be fun to be tenting tonight up here that is for sure. This Hut is at 4500 feet and it is not only incredibly windy outside as I can hear it whipping as I lay hear, but it is also very cool with temperatures in the forties. Tomorrow is Mount Washington day and ridge hiking all the presidential range. I am excited, but I hope the wind calms down.","Pinkham Notch

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545237,"I did not sleep very well on the floor of the Hut last night. The wind was very loud and it blew incredible strong all night. There was also a snorer in the room. It was still an experience and I am glad I did it. I do not think I will be doing it again unless there is bad weather. I left Madison Hut a little after 6:30am. As soon as the sun came up the wind subsided substantially. It was a beautiful day with low humidity, a lot of sunshine, and great visibility as far as you could see. It was a perfect day to hike the presidential range and that is what I did. It is a rough rocky trail from Madison to Washington and it is very hard on the feet. I took it slow as it was only a six mile hike to Mount Washington from the Hut. I arrived there at 11:30am and the place was mobbed. I had some lunch from there kitchen and I saw a bunch of NOBO's I knew from down south. ETA, Soule Asylum, Slow Jam, and Wicks. I also ran into Teridactyle later in the day who I met briefly down south. Apparently I missed Chuckles when we passed each other as I was told he was days ahead heading north. That was a bummer as I was hoping to see him. As I went to get a picture with the summit sign I realized the line was very long so I did not get one. I have one from the first time I hiked the mountain a few years ago anyways. I was glad to get a move on after about forty five minutes. The trails going south from that point on were inundated with day hikers. Too many people. I stopped at Lakes of The Cloud Hut and had some cake and tried to relax, but again too much noise because of so many people. I headed back on the trail and decided one day on this range would be enough. The views were spectacular and the highlight of the day, but I got so use to to quiet solitude of the Mountains in Maine and I loved that. This day was lacking in that department that is for sure. I made my way down to the Mizpah Spring Hut and met up with Data and Caddyshack, both SOBO's who I have seen a talked to a few times. We hiked the rest of the way out of the range and down to the Saco River where we are camped tonight.","Madison Hut

It was like being down south again for a few hours. I stopped at the Zealand Hut for a snack and Leamonade. I sat with Data and a few other hikers. The day was overcast and the views of the Pemi Wilderness at Mount Guyot were fogged out. I made my way up and down South Twin Mountain and Garfield Mountain. By the time I reached Garfield the clouds had lifted and the sun was out. It was a great view of the Pemi Wilderness. I hiked Garfield a few years ago only to get all the way up and get fogged out, so it was nice that I got the view this time. I hiked down the mountain where I am camped tonight at Garfield Pond. Data and Caddie Shack showed up an hour later after dark. They watched the sunset from the top of the mountain. Pretty cool. Tomorrow is the Mount Lafayette and the Franconia Ridge walk. I have done it before and it is incredible. The weather looks good and I am excited to get up there.","Saco River

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545398,"Hiking the Franconia Ridge is one of the highlights of this whole hike. It was a very sunny, warm and hazy day. The haze limited the long distance visibility, but it was still a great walk up there. Being above tree line so much lately has seemed to suck a little energy out of me because it has been rather warm also. I was dragging coming down the long downhill off of the ridge. As I got towards the bottom I kept passing these nice clean streams and every time I passed them I poured water on my face and head and it was very refreshing. I had to make a two mile round trip visit to the Flume Visitor Center to pick up my food for the next four days. It was very hot as I walked on the asphalt bike path. I was able to get some real food from there cafeteria which was a big boost. I loaded up my pack with all the food from my resupply box and headed back on the trail and up the Kinsman Mountains. I stopped in at the Lonesome Lake Hut around 5:30pm to fill my water bottles and get a quick snack. Nobody had taken work for stay yet. I thought about it, but I really wanted to get up the mountain to set up tomorrow. We also have some questionable weather for the next few days so I hiked on to where I am now, which is The Kinsman Pond Shelter. The elevation here is over 3700 feet so it should be a cooler night. I met Lou and Julie here by chance. I hiked with them down south in Virginia for a short time. It was good to see them and I went to their tent site and we talked for a while before I headed to my tent for the night. I should make it to Mount Moosilauke tomorrow which is the last 4000 footer I will hike. However Lou and Julie told me my decent off of the Kinsmans will be more daunting. I have come to not like steep downhill descents. They are mentally taxing and just very nerve racking. If I did not have a thirty pound pack it would be a much different situation. I will just go very slow and hope I can avoid the wet areas. This campsite makes you use wooden tent platforms. I hope I get a decent night of sleep. Last night I did not sleep well at all.

The decent down South Kinsman was the most treacherous and stressful decent of the entire trail, plus it was soaking wet. I was being as careful as I could but I still ended up falling four times. The last time I bounced off my butt and landed off the trail in a grove of small hemlock trees. I landed in a position that was actually comfortable and the hemlock smelled so good so I decided to just lay there for five minutes before getting up. I had almost made it to the base of Mount Moosilauke when the rains hit. I got wet for the first time since being back on the trail. Now the trails were all soaked and I had one of the steepest hardest climbs on the entire trail in front of me. The good thing was it was only 3:45pm. I had plenty of time to do the one on half miles straight up to the shelter. I went very slowly and carefully up the mountain. I got a nice surprise today as I ran into IPA, who I hiked and camped with on and off from Virgina to Pennsylvania. He is a great guy. Then I ran in to Bagger and Thin Mint. I hiked and camped with them on several occasions down south. We talked for a bit before we all were on our way. I remember Chuckles and Thin Mint being so nice and accepting of me on Silver Bald one evening. It is funny how a few small gestures of kindness can effect you and I will never forget how nice and positive they were that night. We had one of the best sunsets that night too. I am at the shelter with Survivor, Waker, Trout, Rockford, and Doc. It is a raining and stormy night so I am staying in the shelter for only the third time.

The trail was soaked this morning and the forecast was for more heavy rain and storms. Survivor, Waker, Trout, and I all headed out around 7:00am in hopes of making it over Moosilauke before the rains. The mountain was socked in with clouds so there was obviously no views. I ended up hiking down the back side of the mountain with Waker and it started raining just as we got to the hikers welcome hostel. I was not planning on staying but I was pretty tired and have not had a break in a little bit. The rain came down hard so it was a easy decision to call it an early day and spend the rest of the afternoon and night here. My body was very happy with the decision. I only hiked about 8 miles in all today and they were pretty easy. I spent the afternoon resting in my bunk and doing chores. This evening I watched the movie Old School with a bunch of other hikers. It felt good to just relax and laugh. The movie really cracked me up and the other hikers as well. I have run into Trotter here at the hostel who I hiked with on my last day in Pennsylvania. Jersey and Paul are here as well. I camped and hiked with them in Virginia through Harper's Ferry. Boston, who was hiking with them just got off the trail a few days ago and they do not think she will be back. I was a little bummed because It would have been nice to see her too. Trout, Waker, Survivor, Data, and Caddie Shack are here tonight as well. The place is packed at over capacity with around forty hikers. It is pouring out tonight. I have 44 miles to Hanover where I will be getting off trail for a few days and staying at my sister house.

I was soaked in sweat all day. I hiked pretty slow and again today and I ran into more people I knew from down south. Tick Talk, Shiv, and Betsy. I stopped and talked to them all. The NOBO's I am running into now are a little more relaxed. These are the hikers who are taking there time and going slower. They seem to be enjoying the trail more then the group I witnessed while hiking through Maine. I ran into two trail magics today. This nice man named Carl had a big table out in the woods with water, orange juice, cookies, corn bread, and bananas. He was really nice. I sat and ate with Data for a short while while we chatted with Carl, and then we were off. I only had one smaller mountain today. Cube Mountain. It was really nice on top with good views. I took a break up there for quite a while with Trout, Caddie Shack, and Crunchy. I then hiked another few miles to the Hexacuba Shelter. There are probably about fifteen people here tonight. I am tenting, but it took a while to find an expectable spot. There are a mix of NOBO's and SOBO's here. SOBO's Eskimo, Crunchy, and Trout are here.

We dropped our packed and talked for a good 15-20 minutes. We got picked up together the day before we began this adventure at the train station and then hiked and camped together several times in Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. She is awesome. After I saw her I then saw Elizabeth. She is the 67 year old women who I hiked with around in Virginia. A super nice lady from Germany.

The trail was either flat packed dirt or flat packed pine needles. The walking was simple with no crazy obstacles. It is a nice change. There were some moderate ups and downs but with good footing it was no problem. I stopped in at a permanent trail magic stop in West Hartford where about a dozen NOBO's were already hanging out. I had a soda and ate my lunch. The lady whose house it is is named Linda and she brought out fresh cold watermelon. It was really good. It was a pretty warm day. Across the street was a bridge going over a river and some of the NOBO's were jumping off the bridge into the water. It was quite high and I decided against it.

It is much hotter in the fields then in the woods. The fields were nice but darn, was it hot out there. It was a pretty uneventful day. Vermont is so different. It reminds me a little like parts of Virginia. I did not make it to the shelter I was shooting for. I found a stealth spot with another SOBO named Wallibe. We ate together and chatted before heading to our tents for the night. He is a super nice guy. The highlight of the day was Blackberry picking. Three times I stopped and picked and ate loads of wild blackberries. They were so darn good.

You could tell storms were on the way all day. It made for good hiking conditions. I made my way through Gifford Woods State Park and there campground which was nice. I was not in the mood to hang out though so I moved through quickly. I finally started making my way up Killington and made it to the shelter just after 3:00pm.

I have been caught in my fair share of storms and heavy rains. It is not fun at all. I decided to go back to the shelter and call it an early day. I will stay nice and dry tonight and will listen to the rain and storms as they come through. Tomorrow I am being picked up by a friend who lives in the area, Gina Raymond, who I went to school with. I had my food for the next five days sent to her and I am staying at her and her husbands house overnight and then getting right back on the trail the next day. This front moving through tonight is bringing much cooler air in. It will feel really good after all the heat and humidity lately. Of course that will mean it will be colder at night too, which I am not a big fan of. So it is only 5:00pm now. I am the only one at this shelter now. I am going to make my dinner and rest.

I even slept until almost 6:00am. this morning. I made the climb up Stratton Mountian easily and enjoyed going up to the top of the look out tower. It provided great 360 degree views. After that it was another full day hiking through the green tunnel with no views. It looked the same as the past six days. It was overcast and cooler which made for good conditions. The overcast conditions turned to rain at about 3:00pm. I was about a mile away from the next shelter. I do not want my boots getting soaked through so I took out my rain poncho and threw it over me as the rain picked up. I was holding the poncho out So my boots would be covered. I was just standing in one place not moving hoping the rain shower would pass. The only problem was when I threw the poncho over myself and my pack it was twisted. This allowed water to stream down my back and onto my backpack. When I realized this I quickly took the poncho off while it was pouring down rain and fixed it and put it back on properly. My backpack was now wet, not good. I stood there another ten minutes before deciding the shower was not going to just pass by. I slowly walk then rest of the way to the shelter holding the poncho out so my feet would stay somewhat dry. It worked I reached the shelter around 4:00pm. and my feet were still dry. I decided to call it a day and stay here tonight. So far it is just Beef Jerky and another guy who is sectioning. He is staying here because he did not want to hike to his car in the rain. All his stuff is wet and he has nothing to sleep in. It does not seem like he is to well prepared. I took all my stuff out of my pack and it was all dry thankfully. So it is another shelter night tonight. Hope I get at least a few hours of sleep. Listening to Kenny Chesney as I write tonight. Great memories that make me feel good...","Stratton Pond Shelter

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546961,"So last night was the worst night of sleep I have gotten during this whole trip. This section hiker who has no business hiking out here kept Beef Jerky and me awake all night. He got cold. What a surprise. Beef Jerky gave him his tarp to wrap himself in. He laid on a hard wood floor with only his wet cloths on all night. He banged around all night with his boots on and the tarp loudly crinkling. It was awful. It rained until 7:00am. The forest was saturated, but I could not stand being around this guy. Beef Jerky and I both left around 8:00am. At first it was nice hiking, then after a half hour the rains came back. I was dancing around again keeping my boots from getting soaked. It only rained for a short time and then after a few hours the sun finally came out. I took my lunch with Beef Jerky. He is a nice guy in his sixties. Funnier then heck. I enjoyed the day which included a lot of rock hoping and jumping to avoid standing water and mud. I stopped at the second shelter of the day around 4:00pm. Beef Jerky came in about ten minutes after me and said did you see the naked girl on the trail. I said no I did not. Apparently I just missed her when I came up to the shelter. I guess her name is Fire Fly and she was totally naked with her pack on while thru hiking north. Beef Jerky was all excited. Talk on the trail is that she is known to do that. Crazy stuff on this trail I tell you. After chatting with Beef Jerky I headed on and he stayed at the shelter for the night. He is going in to Bennington in the morning and I am not. I hope we run across each other again. I hiked on for about four more miles to a place called Harmon Hill. A few day hikers told me about this camping spot and said it was real good. They were not kidding. It is a fantastic spot overlooking the town on Bennington. I got here early enough that I was able to dry all my stuff out in the sun and wind. It is a pretty exposed spot. I had a fantastic sunset. I am very happy and I am going to sleep so good. I am so tired. I have not been too fond of Vermont but this is a perfect last night in this state. My home state tomorrow. Crazy!","Kid Gore Shelter

My mind started racing. Only 300 miles left. In a few weeks this crazy adventure will be over. I started thinking about what life will be like when I come home. When will I go back to work? There were a lot of questions running through my head. I need to just enjoy these last miles and deal with all the other stuff later when I get home. I hiked out of Vermont and into my home state of Massachusetts this afternoon. I just could not get my motor running today so I stopped for the day after fifteen miles at 4:30pm. I am hoping to get to sleep early. Tomorrow I hike up Mount Greylock, which is the highest peak in Massachusetts. I have never been there even though I live in this state. The trail here is way out west and I live in the central part of the state. My Mother and Chuck are meeting me up there and bringing my food drop for the next five days.","Harmon Hill

I woke up full of energy and excited for my first full day in Massachusetts. I really liked the terrain going up and then down Mount Greylock. I met my Mother and Chuck at the top and we had we had lunch and they brought my five day resupply of food. My brother made it up and gave it too her. My brother Greg has gone above and beyond for me during this trip. We had a argument tonight and I feel bad. He is awesome and the best brother in the world. I love him very much and I can not thank him enough for all he has done for me, not only on this trip but in my whole life. I could not imagine my life growing up without him. He is an awesome guy.

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547269,"I must say I am loving hiking in Mass. Vermont was dark, stale, dingy, mucky, and a ton of trees down accross the trail which were a pain. Mass has been open, light, breezy, great footing, and no mud. The trails have been awesome. There is one problem though and that is I have gotten reports that a lot of the reliable water sources coming up in the next few days are dried up. I am not sure how I am going to handle it. I guess we will find out soon enough. Today was a great day of hiking. Yesterday I walked through the town of Cheshire and today I walked through the town of Dalton. It was a long one in a half miles on pavement. It is much harder then you think to walk on pavement as a thru hiker. It is extra hard on the feet and the temperatures are much higher then when in the forest. Short road walks are fine, but long ones kind of stink. I did walk right by a Cumberland Farms around noon. I stopped in and had a few hot dogs and a Powerade for lunch. I talked with another SOBO named Half Size. We then walked to the hostel he stayed at where I filled my water bottle before heading back into the forest. I was glad to be off the streets. It is so much nicer in the woods. I hiked another ten miles before reaching a road where a lady named the Cookie Lady lives. She lets people tent and get water at her house and brings you homemade cookies. I like cookies so I was stopping in. Sure enough she came out and gave me two cookies and they were very good. I thanked her and told her I was not going to stay but was just going to eat my supper and then hike a few more miles. I made it to the October Mountain Shelter around 7:30pm just as the sun was going down. There is only one other person here and he has a very unfriendly German Shepard with him. He is in the shelter and I am tenting near by. I am looking forward to another great day tomorrow just please let there be water.","Saint Marys Church. Cheshire

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547357,"Before I get talking about today I forgot the mention yesterday that I ran into a hiker I have not seen since the first week of my hike. Her name is Special K and she is only fifteen years old. She is hiking the trail alone and doing great. She stayed at Hawk Mountain Shelter on our first night. She had this huge pack and a ton of gear. Well today she had a new much smaller pack and a lot less gear. I hope she makes it all the way. It was really fun to talk with her for a bit. I woke up this am an tried to get to the privy but was once again almost attacked by the dog at the shelter. I got upset with the owner and he said they were just about to leave and I should wait. I said I would not wait and he should control his dog. This dog should not be on the trail and is not friendly at all. He should at least be leashed. After leaving the shelter I had another very nice hiking day in Mass. The trails are the best maintained of all the states I have been in so far. Most people complain about the mosquitos in Mass, but with the lack of water and it being later in the summer I have had no problems with them. I just love these trails. Open, breezy, great footing, some good views, nice fields of wild flowers, some beautiful ponds. The water situation worked out ok. I stopped at a motel around noon, which was only a tenth of a mile of the trail and filled up my bottles. Then at about 4:30pm I stopped at a farm stand where they let you use the hose to fill up. I did carry three in a half liters for the last two miles where I am camped tonight at Shaker Campsite. I am here with a section hiker named Corby. She is very nice and we talked while we both ate our dinners. I was going to hike a few more miles after I ate, but I think she wanted me to stay. There is a big Bear warning poster here. If I left she was going to come too. I new I could not make the next shelter so if I did leave I would have stealth camped somewhere and that did not seem like something she wanted to do. In the end I just decided to stay put here. Who knows, maybe I will get to see another bear. I hiked over 18 miles today. That is plenty. The water situation is going to be iffy all the way to Delaware Water Gap, which is where I will finish. I like not having to hike in the rains, but I need water to drink. The NOBO's say that the locals will put out gallon jugs of water at the some of the trail heads. I hope this is true.

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547482,"I just can not say enough good things about the trail through Mass. It was another wonderful day of hiking. The Berkshires are incredibly beautiful. I passed through so many different type of landscapes today from open woods, to exposed ridge lines, to huge fields filled with tons of wild flowers, to all pine forest. Today had it all. Tomorrow is my last day in this state and I have several steep climbs and descents. I am planning on a shorter milage day. My days out here are winding down and people on the trail keep congratulating me. I still have over 200 miles to go which is a long way. I remember reaching 100 miles in North Carolina and thinking how crazy that was, well now I have twice that left. The water situation continues to be a bummer. I am having to carry two and three liters at a time, which is not good. It is too much weight for me, but I will just keep doing my best with it all. I hate having to ration, but it is what it is. Tonight I stopped at the Appalachian Conservatory which is only a tenth off the trail. I made my dinner there and filled my water containers. It worked out great. It was only 6:00pm. After I ate I checked the weather radar on my phone and rain was moving into the area fast. I packed up quickly and got on the trail. I found a spot after a few tenths of a mile in a field in front of a gate. Good enough for tonight. The shelter was way to far to get to before dark anyways and I wanted to get everything in my tent before the rains came. They still have not come and it is almost 8:00pm. Hmmm. Maybe it missed this area. It sure does feel like it is going to rain though. I had an interesting interaction with a NOBO today. Her name is Croft. It was later in the day and we stopped on the trail and were talking for a bit. She told me she was bummed out because she had to go into Great Bearington because she ran out of gas for her stove. She was going to have to stay in town because of the time of day it was. By coincidence I had two fuel canisters with me. I picked up a full one at Mount Greylock and still had another one that was about a quarter full that I was still using. This was the first time I had been carrying two, but I want to make sure the full one makes it all the way to Delaware Water Gap where I am finishing. I was just thinking today that I could get rid of the quarter full one anytime. I offered it to her and she was so happy. It is really a good feeling to be able to do good for others. Just about all thru hikers partake in doing good for other hikers. It is just the way it is. I love that part of this. Croft and I chatted a bit more before we both headed in opposite directions. The wind is really picking up now outside my tent and the crickets are so loud again. I love this.","Shaker Campsite

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547574,"This morning I woke up to light rain tapping down on my tent above me. I have been sleeping so well in my tent most of the time. The rain let up around 7:00am. I checked the weather radar and there was another band of heavy rain and storms moving in from the west. It looked to be an hour away. I had to decide to pack up and leave or stay and wait for it to come and go. When I was down south I would have packed up and left and then got soaked and then had wet boots for days. I have learned many lessons on this adventure. Sometimes you must wait and be patient in order for things to play out how you want. I decided to wait for the rain to get here before I would leave. That left me in my tent for a few hours. I got my Bible out and randomly picked a place to start reading. It came out to be Romans 12. I read the whole chapter which is not very long. I have read this chapter before and I love it. I encourage you all should read it even if you are not followers of Christ. Then after you read it once read it a second time. It is that good. After reading I tried watching a movie on my phone, but that did not last long. I eventually rolled over and fell asleep again. The rain did come and go and I did not leave my camp area in the field until 10:00am. I was dry and happy. As anticipated it was a day filled with bigger ups and downs. I went up Mount Everett, then Mount Race, then Bear Mountain. All were awesome with great views. The climb up Bear Mountain was a bear. It was steep and straight up, luckily it was not to long. The trail continued to really impress me. I hiked out of Mass and into Connecticut around 3:00pm. Maine has been my favorite state, but I think Mass is my second favorite. As I got into Connecticut I was on the ridge on Bear mountain. It went on for about a mile with great views out to the east. I hiked a lot today on ridges. I was in the sun quite a bit. It felt good. I am at the Riga Shelter tonight and there are only a few people here. It has been nice not having to worry if I will have a place to set up my tent when I get to a camp or shelter area. It was bad down south because there were so many hikers. It has thinned out a lot over the last week. Funny though, I still seem to pass a few NOBO's everyday and some of them are still expecting to make it all the way to Katahdin. I wish them good luck, but I am not sure they have enough time. I have a big mile day planned for tomorrow. I only have a day in a half of food left so I have to be in Kent by Saturday. It should work out fine as long as tomorrow goes well.

I ate my breakfast at the picnic table and watched it come up. It was beautiful and it was hard to leave, but I did eventually and I made great time today while enjoying Connecticut. It is kind of a continuation of Mass. The trail are beautiful and very well maintained and a real joy to hike on. I hiked next to the Housatonic River for a long time. I stopped for lunch at a Hydro Plant where they have water and an electrical outlet. The dam was pretty impressive and the falls after the dam were raging downward over the rocks. It was pretty cool. I hiked up into the mountains out of the town of Falls Village. I noticed the sounds of race cars. When crossing one of the streets I saw a sign for Limerock speedway. For the next several hours I listened to race car roar around the track. You could even see part of the track from a view point where I took a break. I miss going to the races. In the 90's I went and watched Roger Raymond race at our local racetrack. He kicked butt back then. Today made me think about those times. I rather enjoyed these few hours, but soon enough the sound faded away and then it was back to the sounds of the forest. In talking to a NOBO earlier in the day he said the water at the campsite I was headed for was questionable. This was a bummer. I had to stock up about two miles before camp with five liters of water and hike it in. It also included a steep incline if 500 or so feet. When I arrived at camp I was beside myself. The water here was fine, as a matter of a fact it was way better then the water I just hauled two miles. I dumped out all my water and filled back up with the water there. I guess it is better to be safe then sorry. Tonight there are only a few people here at this camp. I talked with a NOBO named Wednesday for a while before turning in. It was another fine day on the trail. I must say I really am liking my time at night in my tent after dinner. It is nice to be off my feet and resting and listening to all the different kinds of crickets and whatever else is out there chirping.

I hiked a five mile totally flat section with no rocks or roots. It was along the Housatonic river. There are not many spots like this along the trail so it was a nice break. I made my way to the trail head going into Kent. I put my thumb out and got picked up right away. I had my resupply box in town which is why I had to go in. I packed up all my food and had three hot dogs before the man I was chatting with offered to drive me back to the trail head. I accepted of course. I was off the trail for a grand total of 45 minutes. My plan was to hike another three miles to a campsite, but it was only 3:00pm. I had thoughts of trying for the next camp area, but that would have been another nine miles. After hiking to the next water source I decided to stick with my original plan and stay at the first campsite. I got here around 5:00pm and had plenty of time to set up and relax a bit. I am feeling really ready to go home. That has not been the case for much of this adventure. I am feeling a real peace within. I also am ready to shower daily, shave my face, eat real healthy foods, not carry my my house and all my belongings on my back everyday, not carry all my trash with me everywhere I go. I am ready to wear different cloths. I am ready not to stink. I am very ready to not wear boots. I want my Teva's. Oh, the list goes on. I am just ready.

Often times I forget things that happen early in my days. The mornings have become my favorite time of the day to hike. My body feels fresh and the air is nice and cool. Lately I have had great morning hikes. Like this morning for instance. I was on the trail just as the sun was rising. I was camped on a ridge last night so I was up kind of high. It was nice to be hiking and watching the sun come up over the mountains in the distance. It gets pretty hot by noon and then I lose some of my moe joe. By late in the afternoon it starts cooling down again, especially now that it is September. I like hiking in the evenings, but I hate getting caught out with no place to camp and darkness approaching. Today I hiked my 2000th mile on this adventure. That is pretty dang cool.

It was still a fine day of hiking. I am stealth camping at Nuclear Lake tonight. I arrived at the shelter back a ways at 4:30pm and did not feel like stopping. It was too early anyways so I hiked on and stopped around 6:00pm. Sorry I do not have much exciting to report. I did see a big deer yesterday in Connecticut. It was really close too.

I also hiked next to Interstate 84 and then the Taconic Parkway, so I got to listen to car roaring down the road. I am not a fan of that. On a positive note I got to breath nice clean forest air all day again today. That never gets old. I set an awfully fast pace today to try and make it to to state park that is on the trail. I hiked 19.5 miles and reached the park around 3:30pm. I went straight to the concession stand, which closed at 4:00pm and ordered two large Cheeseburgers, some Fries, a Powerade and then an Ice Cream. All day all I could think about was that burger. It was wonderful. I ate with a NOBO who's name I forgot. He was good company and we exchanged what is ahead on the trail for each of us.

I know there are some people a day or two in front of me and I know there are people behind me some where. The terrain remained pretty rocky today. I must have kicked 30 rocks sticking up today. That can be irritating. The bugs were also flying around my eyes and ears, but I did not let them get me down. I am keeping my spirits up despite the lack luster terrain. I did do something exciting today though. I crossed the Hudson River. It felt like a big thing. I am not sure if it really is though. Once I crossed I had to get into Fort Montgomery to the Post Office to pick up my last food drop from my brother Greg. I had a little problem getting there though. As I approached a bridge to get into town it was closed to pedestrians. I had to turn around and walk back a half mile and take a historic walking path which was a pain. I eventually got to the post office and picked up my package. I walked across the street to a parking area and unloaded my pack and started repacking all my food for the last five days. A nice man named Jack came up and politely started talking to me about my hike. We chatted for a while and I told him about the problem I had getting into town. I was hoping to catch a ride back to the trail. He immediately offered to bring me. I was very happy about that. I finished packing up and then we headed back to the trail. The trail goes through a Zoo in town, but I have heard nothing but sad things about it, including a section hiker who I saw earlier in the day. She said it was really sad. I decided to take the route you have to take when the Zoo is closed. I do not need to see sadness. I got to the Bear Mountain Inn and Recreation area and it was really nice. I filled up my water then had an Ice Cream and then headed up the mountain. It was a gorgeous path all the way up to the top. A lot of hard work went into this six foot wide path with nice walkways and hundreds of stone steps going up up and away. Just about every state on the AT has a Bear Mountain. This was the best one by far. The only thing that bothered me was all the trash cans were over full and there was an awful lot of trash on the ground in specific areas. The views were nice from up top and even better from the next mountain, which is West Mountain. I am actually camped at the top of it tonight. I can see the New York City skyline through the trees. I was hoping to stay at the shelter which has a great view of it but there was no sign for the shelter and I walked right by the path for it. I eventually backtracked to the shelter junction. It is six tenths of a mile off the trail anyways. It was getting really dark when I found this spot just after the junction. There is a hurricane off the coast. I hope it pulls out to sea soon.

My pants and shirt were drenched in sweat all day. I ran into four different road crossing where Trail Angels had left out gallon jugs of water. This was a God send because the water on the trail has mostly dried up. I drank about seven liters of water today. On a normal day I drink about four or five. Tomorrow is suppose to be hotter. I could only muster about 17 miles before I quit just before 6:00pm. I am camped on the side of the trail on top of Buchanan Mountain. I am very tired tonight. Today and tomorrow are suppose to be my hardest days on this leg and then it gets a easier in New Jersey. At least that is what people are telling me. It did not help that I had a full five days of food and carried one or two liters of water all day. That is a lot of weight. It is nice that every day it gets lighter because I eat the food.

Then all the sudden they all stopped at once. It was spooky. After a few minutes they started back up again. A little later something knocked over my trekking pole and I heard it fall to the ground. There was activity outside my tent all night. I just kept my earplugs in, but even with them in I could here something walking close by. When I did get up in the morning to get my food it was still dark. I got out of my tent with my head lamp on and 50 or 60 feet away I could see two sets of eyeballs looking at me. There eyes glow with my light shining on them and are easy to see. They moved back and forth. I yelled and stomped and what ever they were ran off. Soon after it became light and the sun came up. I was happy to see that. It was a very hot and humid day again today. Worse then yesterday. I struggled with my energy level. It was a difficult morning with more rocks and meaningless ups and downs. I stopped at a hot dog stand for lunch and the man running it said there are a lot of coyotes in this area and they have been know to be aggressive towards people. There is also a very high population of black bears and rattle snakes. It is always something out here. I made the decision to only stay at shelters the remaining few days. I crossed into New Jersey at 2:00pm. It felt good to be done with New York and only have one more state left. It is crazy. I made my way to Wawayanda State Park around 4:30pm. I needed to fill up all my water containers for the night here. They had a bathroom with running water. I am really gross right now. I basically gave myself a bath and also washed my shirt, pants, and underwear in the sink. It was not perfect by any means, but it will be a whole lot better tomorrow putting them on. I did make sure the bathroom was good and clean before I left. I only had about three tenths of a mile to the Wawayanda Shelter where I am staying tonight. I was hoping for some people, but it is 8:00pm now and I am here all alone. There is a chance of storms overnight so I am actually in the shelter, which is rare for me. It is still very warm and humid. It is suppose to stay in the 70's tonight. Everything is so sticky. I doubt I will sleep very well. The other thing that has happened the last few day is the mosquitos have finally found me. They have been pretty bad in a lot of areas, especially if I stop for very long. Tomorrow I am going to try to hike 21 miles so I can stay at a hostel. I am not sure I can make it that far in this weather. It sure would be good to get a shower and get my laundry done as well.

It was strange being the only one at a shelter. I was on the trail at daylight and my spirits were very high. I was singing away as I left camp. I had the two hardest days of this final leg behind me and I was determined to make the 21 miles to the hostel by day's end, as I was in dire need of a shower and to get my laundry done. It turned out to be a great day of hiking. I went down the ""Stairway to Heaven"" which was a steep descent for me. A lot of rock steps and boulders to maneuver around. I am glad I did not have to up it. After that it was very easy the rest of the day. I hiked through amazing fields of wild flowers on a boardwalk that went on forever. Flowers as far as you could see on either side. It was overcast and I was thankful for that as it was still very warm and humid today. Not having the sun directly on me helped a lot. The trails were very well taken care of. In a lot of ways it was like being back in Massachusetts. I was so happy to have an easier day with such amazing landscape all around. The butterflies and dragon flies were all flying around. I loved this day. It was a good day to be on the trail. I ended up picking up the pace towards the end of the day as storms were in the afternoon forecast. I easily made the 21 miles and called the hostel to come get me at 4:30pm. It is a great deal. $20.00 for a bed, shower, laundry, ride to and from the trail, and Mosey even brought me into town where I ordered some nice New York Brick Oven Pizza, which was amazing. The name of this hostel is Moseys Hostel. It is new this year. I needed this bad and I am thankful to be here. Mosey and I chatted while I ate and now I am in bed. I am thinking two in a half days of hiking left. If all goes as planned I will be sleeping in my own bed Monday night.46.3 miles left","Wawayanda Shelter

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548272,"Mosey brought me back to the trail after making me a great breakfast. It had rained over night so the trails were all wet. The morning was slightly cooler, but it did not take long before the heat and crazy humidity took over again. The hiking was not difficult, but there was quite a few areas of rocks to negotiate around. I had to carry extra water because there still is very little water on the trail. The humidity sapped all my energy and really took the fun out of hiking today. It was very nice to have clean clothes on though. Around 3:00pm I decided to call Mosey and see if she would drive 20 miles and pick me up and let me stay at her hostel again tonight. She agreed and I was super happy. I did not have very good camping options for the night. I would of had to haul five liters of water about four miles to the next shelter with the first part of that being a decent climb. So like I said, I was very happy Mosey came and got me. I was at the trail head at 5:30pm and Mosey picked me up shortly after. It was nice to take another shower and then I had a camping meal. I am watching the nascar race now with my feet up. I am feeling great. It is still very muggy tonight and a good chance of storms. I am very glad to be indoors tonight. Mosey is pretty awesome. I only have two more shorter days out here. The end is right in front of me.28 miles to go","Moseys Hostel. Courtwrite Road

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548359,"It was another big breakfast at Moseys before she brought me back to the trail. I kind of dragged my feet a bit as a line of rain was about to come through the area. It came and went and it really did not rain very long. When I got dropped off the wind was blowing very hard and the air had turned dry. It felt amazing. Thank goodness all that heavy humid air is gone. The hiking today was nice. I drank so much less water. There was some nice ridge walks with great views, but also many areas that were rocky. Those areas were tough on my feet. I just took my time and went slow through them. I arrived at the AMC's Mohican Outdoor Center around 6:00pm. After looking at the bunk house and the tenting area I decided to sleep on one of the couches in the main lodge. It is really comfortable. I just have to be out of here by 8:00am. That will not be a problem as I plan to leave at first light. I can not believe this is my last night. A lot of thoughts ran through my head today. I have come a long ways since Springer Mountain in Georgia. I know now that I knew nothing then. I figured it out though. It has been one heck of a journey. 10.8 miles tomorrow and I am done.","Moseys Hostel. US 206 Branchville

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548524,"My last night was nice and comfortable. The couch I slept on in the lodge was awesome. I was up at daylight and felt a nervous excitement upon getting on the trail for my last day. I had a little less then 11 miles to finish this hike that I started on March 28th. It was a picture perfect day. Bright blue skies with no clouds and nice dry air. The hike today featured some awesome ridge walks with fantastic views, but also a bunch of rock fields that abused my feet pretty good. My thoughts were all over the place as I made my way to town. I can not believe this is the last day. I have come a long way out here. I have learned so much. I am not a big believer that people change much. You pretty much are who you are. I think you can make minor adjustment and your perspective on life can definitely change. I am not sure what impact this journey will have on me. I guess time will tell. I have met so many amazing people and seen, felt, and smelled the beauty of this trail and all it has to offer. I have loved it, even the hard times. Being able to fight through the tough times and get through them is something I am proud that I was able to do, and believe me there were many tough times where it seemed like everything was going against me. This is the hardest thing I have ever set out to do. I said I was going to do it and I did. I have never quit anything in my adult life. I am not a quitter and I am proud of that. I had a lot of help though. All the Trail Angels along the way, fellow hikers, people who picked me up hitch hiking, my brother Greg and his family, my sisters Leslie and Becky and their families, my Mother and my Father, Val, and Gina Stewart. A big thank you to all of you. Back to the end of my hike today. I made my way down into Delaware Water Gap and reached the bridge a little after 11:00am. Half way across this bridge and I will have completed this incredible long journey. I was full of emotion as I started out on the bridge. I thought about my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and I thought about my friend Pete who passed when I was in Virginia. It was like God was on one of my shoulders and Pete was on the other and we marched towards to the New Jersey, Pennsylvania Boarder. Pete has been with me ever since he passed. I could hear his voice in my head repeatedly during my time on the trail, especially when I was feeling defeated and down. I could hear him telling me to suck it up and that I could do this, along with a few other metaphors. He had a way with words like few others did. As I finally reached the end point half way across the bridge over the Delaware bridge I took one big breath and took the final step over and back into Pennsylvania. It was over. I had done it. 11:22am. I sat there for a half hour. Tears ran down my face and I was pretty darn happy. As had been the case all morning, so much was running through my head. Another hiker came by and took some photos of me by the boarder. Eventually I walked the last three tenths of a mile to the church hostel. I got congratulations from several other hikers who were there. I took a shower and when I was finished my Dad had arrived to pick me up. I was very glad to see him and we headed for home just after noon. It took five hours to get home. Val was here and it felt good to be home. I do not know what else to say now except, I WALKED FOR PETE and we did it! We did it! We did it!!!","Mohican Outdoor Center

Foot Locker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549225,"I am writing this entry from my sisters house in North Carolina. I have spent the last two days finishing two sections of the trail that I had to skip over earlier in the year. I left my house Monday in my car and headed for Glasgow Virginia. It was about a nine hour drive from my home in Massachussetts. I arrived in the town of Glasgow around 7:00pm. I pulled into the free in town shelter. I was excited to be there. There were two other hikers there. Viper and a hiker whose name I do not want to share. Both seemed nice as I arrived. Viper and I talked quite a bit and the other hiker got a ride to a bar and left. This shelter was unique in that it had a shower with hot water and it had electricity. It was pretty nice as far as shelters go. It was a nice night so I set up my tent. After eating my dinner and chatting some more with Viper I turned in and went to sleep in my tent. All was well until the other hiker returned and I was awoke by him and his drunkenness. At 10:30pm. He woke me up as he was very loud as he stoked the fire and was talking loudly on his phone. He was threatening and belligerent to who ever he was talking to. He apparently had an altercation at the bar and was going on about it and how he had to pull a knife out. He proceeded to be loud for the next few hours. He was clearly a bad person as he continued to curse and threaten who who ever he was talking to. I finally got up around 12:30am and moved my tent far away from the shelter. He continued his rant until after 2:00am. I thought about packing up and getting out of there because the whole thing made me extremely uncomfortable. This guy was psychotic. In the end I just stayed and finally got back to sleep. I only managed about three hours of sleep. I met my shuttle driver at the James River Bridge parking area at 7:00am. It was barely getting light. He drove me up the parkway to Petite Gap where I was to hike about ten miles back to my car. This is the area I had a bad night with some problem bears. I ended up with another group of four who called themselves Team Blue. It was a crazy night that ended with two parkway patrol officers shooting at the bear. The next morning I skipped this ten mile section because I was not comfortable hiking through it as the patrol vehicles were parked at the trail head. So I have returned to hike it. When I got dropped off it was a bit eire. It was foggy, dark, and wet. After a few minutes and some deep breaths I headed into the woods. The hike started with a climb which I was glad for because it got lighter fairly quickly. It did not take long for me to shake off the little bit of nervousness I had. I had forgotten how nice the trails were down south. There are very few rocks or rocky sections compared to the north. It was easy going on my feet. Hard packed dirt trail, what a relief! It was very nice. The hike ended up being very nice and brought back a lot of good memories. The mountains and trails down here are beautiful. I crossed over the James River and made it back to my car at about noon. Now I only had one fifteen mile section left in Hot Springs. I got in my car and headed south on I81. It was a nice ride except I was a little sleepy and had to stop several times to wake myself up. I liked seeing all the signs along the way of the trail towns I had hiked through over the past six months. I arrived in Hot Springs around 5:00pm. I checked into the Laughing Heart Hostel, which is where I stayed in April. I like this hostel and it was probably my favorite one. I had my own room with a twin bed and an air conditioner. I met a group of five who were flip floppers. They were headed south and only had a few hundred miles left on there hike. They were a very nice group of hikers. I turned in very early as I was very tired. I slept great and for about ten hours. I was up and at the outfitters at 7:00am for my shuttle up to Allen Gap. From there I would hike back to Hot Springs where my car was. It was a little harder and longer hike then the day before, but I was excited to get started. I had several good climbs in the morning, but just like in Virginia the trails were so level with no rocks or rocky areas. I loved it. I made very good time as I hiked to the first shelter. I took a break there. It is weird being down here with hardly any other hikers around. It was crazy in the spring with tons of hikers everywhere. I continued to hike towards town when I came to a fire tower. There are a lot of fire towers along the trail and this was to be my last one. I went up as I have for all of them and spent some time looking at the mountains in the distance. It was nice and relaxing. After the fire tower I soon entered the area that was affected by the wild fires. The wild fires were the reason myself and others had to skip this section of the trail. It was closed for ten days. I was pleasantly surprised by how the forest had already started to recover from the devastation. A lot of trees where sprouting new growth and the forest floor had a lot of green undergrowth. It was not nearly as bad as I had anticipated. The worst part for me hiking through these areas was the bugs. For some reason they were really bad through the fire areas. I took my final break on a bridge which had a nice breeze and a shady area on it and it was bugless. I am going to miss taking breaks in the forest. They are so peaceful and comfortable. After my break I hiked the last few miles into Hot Springs. The hike down into town was really nice as it featured the French Broad River which went through town. As I made my way halfway across the bridge over the river I had officially hiked the entire Appalachian Trail. All 2189.1 completed. It was a great feeling as I had finished what I had set out to accomplish. I slowly walked back to town and my car. I went back to the hostel and got congratulations from Greg who was the nice young man running to hostel. I took a shower and then set out on the four in a half hour ride to my sisters in Holly Springs NC. I arrived at 8:00pm and it was nice to be here. I was greeted by Leslie, Doug, Jordan, and Abby. We all chatted and ate dinner. The evening was topped off as I sat down on the couch and turned the Red Sox game on ESPN. The Sox were losing 1-0. With in five minutes of me turning it on the Red Sox had taken the lead 5-1 and went on to win there seventh game in a row. A perfect ending to a perfect day. So my adventure is now officially over and what an adventure it has been. I may or may not enter a post journal entry. Now it is time for me to start getting re acclimated into society and ""real"" life. I have to go back to work, which in a lot of ways I am looking forward to. I have no idea how this adventure will change my perspective on my life. I need to let it all sink in and I am sure in time I will have those answers. In the meantime I am footlocker and I am signing out. God Bless....","Home
