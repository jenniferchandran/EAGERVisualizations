Happy Talk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535712,"Just a few more days and I head from Florida to Virginia to meet up with family and start my next section hike! I've packed and repacked and will pack until I walk away from the car which drives everybody crazy but when it's all you've got, well...it's all you've got!   I know from experience that a journey on a trail can compare with life's journey and I just can't wait to see what's over that rise and around that bend. My mission is to enjoy God and enjoy life while I'm at it, even during the times when I know I can't go on. I've got my feather..Psalm 91:4Happy Talk","Damascus, VA

Happy Talk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536219,"So. Check off Meal Preparation. I used a Food Saver to vacuum-seal individual portions and sealed a day's worth. I'll carry enough for about 4 days and then resupply from my family trail support. So, what's fer supper, Grandma? We'll have mashed taters, beef jerky and gravy; beef n' veggies; chili; or couscous n' textured vegetable protein (TVP). Yum Yum! For breakfast we'll have Hoosier Farms eggs; quinoa, brown sugar and cranberries; grits; or Biscotti and dried fruit. Num Num! Plus I have GORPSS - Good Ole' Raisins and Peanuts Sue-Style.

Happy Talk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538389,Had a good time of rest and relaxation courtesy of my Personal Trail Angel who waited on me toe and foot...literally. A blister that started on Day One was slowing me down (if that is possible!) so between the doctor's wife and this Hospice nurse we managed to pamper the thing in order to get back out and find out what's on down The Trail.,"Beech Mt Rd 601

Happy Talk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537288,"(Had no signal so this is written in hindsite from Damascus library) Started 6/5, pm, SOBO from Massie Gap. Hiked until I crossed the Grayson Highlands border where camping is allowed. Hammock and tarp worked great against the rain and wind. Could have slept on a rock! Thought I'd make it much farther on 6/6 to meet sister at Elk Garden. Funny me! Took 4 hours to go 2 miles up rock. My encouragers, Barnabus and Bunny (my trekking poles) saved the day. Stayed at Thomas Knob shelter from 12 to 2 with ponies and many hikers. Impressed with family of day-hikers, proud of the parents. Slept somewhere. Finally met my personal Trail Angel at Elk Garden and drove back to GHSP for yummy salad, laundry, nap and shower to remove the stink. Serious NERO day. Decided to skip Whitetop and got dropped off to head DOWN south as far as Virginia Creeper Trail, rode to Damascus to download pictures and talk to you! Did I mention I'm out of shape for this? So, I'm a flip-flopping section-hiker and loving every step of this journey. Word to the wise: Do not use Bear Spray the same way you would use bug spray. The only way it would work is that the bear would see you writhing and crying and gagging and choking and flailing your arms. He would run away. I didn't try it, but thought it was funny when I thought of it. Word for Day 1: Encouragement - my poles, the song - ""Lean on me when you've got no strength to stand"" Word for Day 2: Water - always at the bottom of the hill when I'm tired? Yet, always there, always refreshing. Water from Creation to the Cross, blessing. Word for Day 3: Path - Whether up or down, rocky or smooth it's all part of the journey. ""Lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your path.""","campsite

Happy Talk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537409,"Started last night about 6pm SOBO from US 58 toward Damascus. Saw a bear playing hide 'n' seek at 6:25. I heard him thrash to get a better view of me and when I finally had my camera ready he was hiding behind a small tree - ears sticking out each side. Ha ha, I see you! But picture's not so good, blurred (couldn't keep your hand still, Sue?) Found a perfect campsite about 8pm and slept well in my tent, serenaded by birds to sleep and awaken. Word for the day is ""laborers."" Saw and appreciated so many evidences of hiker volunteer handiwork. From a nice log to sit on at my campsite, to a stump-chair perfectly placed, to a cool log bench beside the trail to an archway, (am I lost? Is this Arches National Park?) to cleared blow-downs and lopped edges. Spent the morning thinking about the workers and suddenly met a Mt Rogers Trail Maintainer - working on my section! Thank you Terry! He said, not complaining, that of the 100+ members of his group about 10 work on the trail, most 80-year old +. The work is plenty, the laborers are few. Thank you, Trail Crews from Georgia to Maine. To top off the day I had lunch at the Country Store and was joined by Trans Am Bikers raising money for MS by biking Yorktown to California! Thank you, on behalf of my cousin David and many others. Great day on the trail. ""Whether therefore you eat or drink or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God.""","US 58 AT/Feathercamp Trail

Happy Talk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537997,"Actually started this section last night headed toward The Scales. Waded across a stream in my Crocs and chose to continue a little further without changing to boots. By 7:55 pm hadn't found a good campsite and prayed I'd find one within 5 minutes or I'd sleep at the next flat spot I found. 8pm spied a clearing which turned out to be the perfect place. Slept well and decided to skip breakfast and hike in my Crocs until I could find a chair, preferably with a backrest. Answered prayer! Having a deer join me was an added plus. When I'm hiking I always pray for certain people when I see flowers that bring them to mind - yellow for my blond friends, Lady Slippers for my girls, and for this trip - purple flowers for my friend Karen who likes Lilacs and had eye surgery gone bad. Many prayers for her today. Beautiful day, great hike in a cool breeze. Met my sister at 603 and enjoyed her outdoor shower to rinse off the funk. Life is good. God answers prayer.","Grayson Highlands State Park

Happy Talk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537999,"Slept at Grayson Highlands and got dropped off at Dickey Gap. Started out by misreading the signs and after 10 minutes I was back where I started. Note to self: If you don't see white blazes, you're not on the AT! Decided today's word was ""Time."" Wondered about that 10 minutes - what adventure would I have? What would I see? What would I miss? Who would I meet? I met no hikers all day so my thoughts got a little deeper: It's been 20 years post-cancer prognosis of 5-15 years. It's been 20 years since our Christie's birth and death. What have I done with mine, what would she have done with hers? Didn't make plans or promises but had some good soul-searching, which The Trail promotes when I'm listening.Interesting trail today with pastures, bridges, ups and down, streams, toads, another snake and a couple of great mountain views. Time well spent.","Dickey Gap

Happy Talk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538000,"Heard foot steps at my camp last night and learned from another hiker down the trail that bears had visited several sites. Glad I didn't smell like food. Spent the day switching socks, boots to Crocs, Crocs with socks (Where's Dr Seuss when you need him?) and finally one foot with Croc, the other bare. All to accomodate blisters which started on Day One and treated but obviously not adequately. Met some great people and saw some great sites in spite of the feet but glad to meet my sister, sad to make the decision to retire the boots and, well...the mountains will be here another day.","Campsite

Happy Talk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539204,"After I wimped out for 5 days nursing blistered feet I woke up this morning and told Connie that neither of us signed up for lounging at a KOA in Boone, NC. I had a rock to deliver to Angel's Rest to remember a 20th birthday and I knew of no other way to get it there. I headed to Wood's Hole Hostel (what a wonderful place) to get up early in the morning for the 11 mile hike, meet a shuttle at 3:30 and get back to Wood's Hole for dinner and another night's rest. It was a great day and even if her rock doesn't stay in place, I appreciated Christie's motivation to get me back on The Trail.","Wood's Hole Hostel

Happy Talk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539205,"Took Sunday off to drive up the Blue Ridge Parkway and set up at a KOA near Natural Bridge. Connie dropped me off this morning for the 3 mile hike down to the 200' falls. Well worth the effort. Saw several thru-hiker ""Hangers"" with hammocks set up either beside or over the falls. Impressed that they took the detour from their l-o-n-g white blaze trek to spend the night in such an awesome place. Wished I had my hammock. Instead just relieved those aching feet and headed back to the van for the next journey on the AT: Thunder Ridge to Petites Gap, another 2.3 miles. (Really? Only 5.3 miles today surrounded by all those people hiking Georgia to Maine? Oh well, hike your own hike...","Blue Blaze Trail

Happy Talk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539209,"Exciting hike today along the Skyline Drive. Started out with a really good fall to hands and knees. Knocked a lens out of my glasses, tore my pants and my knee. My first Bejabor! (That's what my dad called our bumps and bruises.) Shortly after putting myself back together I heard a boulder fall and saw a bear hurrying away from the clumsy hiker. Ended up seeing 3 more bear today. Heard thunder in the mountains behind, beside, in front, depending on which way the trail was taking me. Finally the thunder and lightening was all around me and I was deciding whether to hunker down 'til it was over or continue running down the hill with everything flapping. It had been such a fun day I opted for the crazy lady look. Fortunately, only this turtle saw me and gave me his advice - which I ignored. Came to a road crossing and was picked up by a family of Trail Angels who delivered me to Connie's Haven just before the skies opened up for a downpour. So, what did you do today?","Doyles River Parking Lot

Happy Talk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539211,"We are kicking back at a Luray, VA KOA. Will leave in the morning for Front Royal and a family memorial service, then back to life in Florida. The mountains in this picture are in the background but will always be in the forefront of my mind, beckoning. When I combine the 412 miles I hiked in 2006 with the sections of this one I'm close to 500 miles on the AT. Kids and grandkids have itching feet to join me so the journey will go on. I leave with a heart full of gratitude.","
