The Georgia Peach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551666,"Day 1. I was tired, my Backpack weighed to much, it was late, it was cold, I was low on water. I tried setting up my tent and I couldn't figure out the poles. So, I tossed them to the side, staked out the four corners and crawled inside.","Amacalola Falls State Park

The Georgia Peach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555500,"I was headed Northbound on the Appalachian Trail and I had just made it to the top of the next climb past the only A.T. campground in the Smokies. Thats when I spotted a big ole Black tree stump ahead of me. I almost thought it was a bear. But, as I got within 50 yards or so that tree stump did something I'd never seen a tree stump do before, it moved! I stopped in place, trying to figure out if my eyes where playing tricks on me. I just starred it down waiting to see if it would do what it had just done a few moments before. And it did. The thing I thought was a Big ole black stump, turned, stepped out and crossed the A.T. heading east. It was a Black Bear and my very first Black Bear encounter in the Wilderness. Alone, I only knew to do a few things. 1. Make Noise 2. Throw something 3. Turn tail and haul ass. I did 1 and 2 but it didn't have any effect on the grazing Bear ahead of me. It was moving and very slow. Although I was 50 yards of it, it eventually went behind a tree and down off the Hill to my east. I could hear it moving slowly and I was looking in the direction in which I thought I would see it next. (I was sort of mad about the entire situation because none of the things that I had learned about bears worked. It just ignored me.) I waited for 5 or 10 minutes but I could only hear a very faint bit of noise from the bear. Just a little bit of leaves moving around. I knew 4 other hikers where about a mile south of me so I decided to go back and see if they had any better ideas on how to get this better to move out of the way. So, I turned and hiked in the opposite direction. Southbound on the A.T. I only made it 20 yards or so before I saw another Bear off to my left. This one was closer and something wasnt right. I really pay attention to my surroundings. How did I miss a bear on my way Northbound. I thought about this as I kept walking, only for a moment before I realized what had just actually happened. The bear that was previously a head of me, had gotten out of sight, and that little bit of noise I heard it making was indeed the bear creeping by me just out of sight. The bear had gotten closer and was coming up from behind me.(i'll finish editing this later on. This is from 2016 A.T. Thru-hike)","Fontana Hilton

The Appalachian Trail hasn't seen the last of me. I had such a bad time this past season that it really doesn't make sense for me to go back. But, something tells me that not only do I need to finish but that I will finish up in 2017. However, I will be starting completely over at Amicalola State Park. If for some reason I don't thru-hike its not a big deal. Sectioning is fine with me.",,"Pearisburg, VA","Jul 20, Wed",0
The Georgia Peach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555968,"This is my second year in a row hiking the Georgia section of the Appalachian Trail. I did the steps at Amicalola Falls this year by hitch hiking to the top and walking down then hitch hiking back up and continuing north bound after Sunday Brunch at the Lodge which I highly recommend. Last year I hiked from the Visitor Center at Amicalola Falls State park to woody gap in 5 days. This year it only took me 2 and a half days of hiking. I decided to hike from Hawk Mtn. Shelter to Woody Gap. I stopped in for lunch at Gooch Mtn. Shelter. It was getting late and I knew that I would have to night hike if I wanted to make it into Woody Gap. Which I did. I was about half a mile from Woody Gap, I was hiking in like a Champ, when I stopped to have a bite to eat. It was then I realized that I had left my stove 4 miles back at Gooch Mtn. Shelter. This morning I got lucky with a ride all the way back to Gooch Gap and my stove was about to be carried out as trash by one of the two ridgerunners.","Amicalola Falls State Park

I'm not sure if it was fog or that I was in the clouds but between that, the rain, the dense forest and the night I would wonder off trail a few times. I reached Roan High Knob Shelter around 10:30 p.m. I got all set to goto sleep when Nature called. So, that was around midnight. I went out, used the bathroom and I lost the shelter. Between, the fog, the dense forest, and the night sky I had lost the Roan High Knob Shelter. My headlamp couldn't penetrate the fog. I roamed the night forest but I couldn't find it. Every which was I wen't it didnt matter. It was gone. I started walking a grid pattern that I made up in my head and after 20 minutes of searching, I found it. I came in behind it. I had left out in a ""Port Bow"" direction from the shelter and came in from the ""Stern"".","Greasy Creek Gap
