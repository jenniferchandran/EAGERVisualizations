Stumblefoot (aka Marginal),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520727,"Well I am 3 months away from setting off on what is sure to be the grandest adventure that I have ever attempted. For those who are not yet up to speed on my plans, I am going to be doing a flip-flop hike of the Appalachian Trail starting in May. The trail stretches from Springer Mountain, Georgia to Mt. Katahdin, Maine. A flip-flop hike is one where you start somewhere in the middle, hike to one end, then flip back to your start and hike to the other end. In my case I am starting from Harper's Ferry, Virginia which is just about in the middle and hiking north to Maine then going back to Harper's Ferry and hiking south to Georgia. Total distance = 2,189 miles. Estimated duration 6 1/2 months. The time and distance commitment is not lost on me, and the enormity of what I am going to do becomes ever more real as I make my preparations.My underlying anxiety is starting to manifest itself in weird, half-remembered dreams. For example, I recently dreamt that I had arrived at the airport after my flight to Harper's Ferry but couldn't locate my luggage. I finally find what I think is my bag and open it to check if my stuff is inside. What I find is that the bag has my stuff, but it is not the right stuff for my hike. It's the hiking equivalent of the old high school dream where you come to class and realize that you studied for the wrong test.I'm sure that I will have more of these dreams. It's part of my nature to over-analyze and over-plan these kind of things and the fear of missing an important detail makes me crazy. The fact that this trip is so much bigger than anything I have ever done before makes me more crazy. So I will continue to review my plans and recheck my gear. It's what I do while counting down the days.",,3 Months Out,"Feb 04, Thu",0
Stumblefoot (aka Marginal),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520763,"I was very fortunate growing up that my father got me started hiking and backpacking when I was young. We moved to Arizona from Pennsylvania when I was 7 years old. My dad loved the desert and the mountains of Arizona so he brought me and my friends on trips to places like Aravaipa Canyon, Havasupai Canyon, and of course the Grand Canyon. Thus began my love of hiking. In the years since then I have hiked some in some truly amazing and beautiful places. I have hiked to the top of Half Dome and Yosemite Falls in Yosemite National Park. I have hiked Angels Landing and the Narrows at Zion National Park. I have hiked the Grand Canyon so many times that I have lost count. I hiked the White Mountains of New Hampshire. I have hiked through slot canyons and to mountain tops. My most memorable trip to date was the trip I took with my father, his friend Bernie, and my son Justin down to Peru to hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. These trips have ranged from a day or two to over a week in the backcountry (or jungle in the case of Peru).",,Hiking History,"Feb 05, Fri",0

Stumblefoot (aka Marginal),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521279,"So I've decided to move my departure date up by two weeks. This will allow me to attend the Flip-Flop kickoff event in Harper's Ferry the weekend of Apr 16-17. My wife wasn't entirely thrilled with this news until I pointed out that it will mean that I'll be back home two weeks earlier as well. I get the impression that she thinks I'm going to get on the trail and never want to return. I, on the other hand, think that I will be more than ready to have a soft bed and hot shower at my disposal. Nevertheless I am both eager to begin and anxious about how much remains to be done before I go. But that is another topic for another day.",,Movin on Up,"Feb 16, Tue",0
Stumblefoot (aka Marginal),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523672,"Today marks exactly 4 weeks until my departure date. Suddenly time seems very short and there is much to do before I go. I am still working out my resupply points and what will go into my mail drops. There are meetup arrangements to make with friends and family who will be joining me on trail. Not to mention I have to finish up our taxes. Still, I have checked a few things off the list. I was able to do a short shakedown trip last weekend with my friend Mike where I tested out some of my new gear and tried some sample trail food. We were gifted with an overnight snowstorm which proved that my tent was up to the task but that my lightweight sleeping quilt won't cut it when the temps go below freezing (not really a surprise on that one). My new Jetboil stove is a wonder of engineering and efficiency. As for the trail food, the dehydrated meal that my wife made was better than expected even though I didn't rehydrate it quite right. The rest of the food was hit or miss with the travel size hummus pack being the standout. Well it's time to get back to my planning. Adios for now.",,Crunch Time,"Mar 15, Tue",0
Stumblefoot (aka Marginal),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528450,"So it is Sunday night and I am sitting in my bunk at the Teahorse Hostel ready to begin my hike tomorrow morning. My travel began on Tuesday when I flew into Washington DC. I spent Wednesday touring the Capitol, the National Museum of Art, the Washington monument, the WW2 memorial, the Korean War memorial, the Lincoln memorial, the FDR memorial, and the Jefferson memorial. The National Museum of Art is truly amazing not only for the art inside but the building itself which is quite beautiful. The WW2 memorial was very well done and moving. The Korean War memorial was absolutely haunting. On Thirsday I toured the White House, the National Archives, the Museum of American History, the Museum of Natural History spending several hours in each. Truly some amazing things to look at and think about. On Friday I took the train to Harper's Ferry WV where I have been staying at the Teahorse Hostel. I met 5 other hikers on the train and we quickly grouped up and started sharing our stories. I met Bill (Rocketman), Brenda (Coldfire), Alisha, Wazo, and Betsy (Ziptie). We all hung out at the Flip Flop kickoff festival at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy eating, listening to music, attending seminars, and visiting vendors. At a meeting with the director of the ATC we met a previous thru hiker named Wolf who has completed the trail 5 times and whose base pack weight (excluding food and water) is under 5 lbs!!! A very funny lady who runs the outfitter in town has christened me with the trail name Marginal due to my working in the finance industry and now living on the margins of society. We'll see if it sticks. Today was spent sending off the first group of hikers where we lost 4 of our little group. About a dozen hikers total went up the trail this morning. Coldfire and I will be joining tomorrow's group which looks to be about 10 or so people. That's about it for now. My next check in should be in about 5-6 days from the Prnnsylvania/Maryland border.",,Travel Time,"Apr 17, Sun",0
Stumblefoot (aka Marginal),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529307,"Day 1 - Harper's Ferry to Ed Garvey shelter 7.5 miles. First day was really good. Hiking with Brenda (Coldfire). Started with a nice 3 miles along the C&O canal towpath. Then began a steep climb up the hillside to a great overlook called Weverton Cliffs. Nice views up and down the Potomac river valley. Took a rest break there and then continued uphill another couple of miles to the shelter. It appeared ahead of me unexpectedly, I was thinking we still had a couple miles left but we arrived at about 12:15. The shelter is a nice two story platform with a wide porch and fire pit with benches. Unfortunately it is also very popular with the local bee population so I decided to set up my tent up the hill. The water source is a spring 1/2 mile down a steep hillside. Inconvenient but necessary so I made the trip. People keep trickling into the shelter a little at a time so looks like we have about 15 tonight. Also we are changing Brenda's trail name from Coldfire to Velcro because she keeps misplacing things. Day 2 - Ed Garvey shelter to Dahlgren campground 11 miles. Another warm day today. Yesterday the high was in the 80's and today was close to 90 according to my little key fob thermometer. The sun was intense and since the trees haven't realized that winter is over yet there is not a leaf canopy to provide shade. The day was tiring due to an abundance of rocks and my feet were sore. My original goal today was to hike to Rocky Run shelter which would have given me a 8.5 mile day which lines up with my goal of keeping the miles low the first week until I get my hiker legs. Well last night I got a text from Rocketman saying that Dahlgren campground had FREE hot showers and you could get pizza delivered to the campground! Since I was feeling particularly hot and sweaty the idea of a shower was enough to convince me to hike the extra miles. Better still, just 1/4 mile up the road is the Old South Mountain Inn, an historic tavern and lodge that dates back more than 275 years although the inn part is closed now. After consulting with the group we (Velcro, Captain Panda, Midnight Strider, Towtruck, and a few others) decided that we would eat our camp food and then head up to the inn for dessert and drinks. It made for a great end to a difficult day. Wildlife tally - snapping turtle (yesterday), rat snake, wild turkey. Day 3 - Dahlgren campground to Annapolis Rocks campground 7.4 miles. Moderate hike to a great overlook. I have been renamed by my trail family as Stumblefoot in honor of my ability to trip over perfectly flat ground as evidenced by my scabs from Washington DC. I think this one will stick. Anyway we had our dinner at the overlook at sunset and it was amazing. Long day planned tomorrow to position for a short day Friday. Day 4 - Annapolis Rocks campsite to Raven Rock shelter 11 miles. The word of the day is intermittent. Intermittent rain, intermittent hills, intermittent rocks. The first six miles to lunch at Ensign Cowell shelter went fast enough averaging about 2 mph. The second half was rough with lots of rocks and a particularly brutal uphill to the Raven Rock shelter followed by another rough hike 4/10 mile downhill and back up for water. The shelter itself is fantastic. It's a new shelter with double platforms and room for 12-14 people. Tonight marks the first time that I will be sleeping in a shelter instead of in my tent. The reason is that there is supposed to be thunderstorms moving in around 3 am. Full house tonight with Captain Panda, Midnight Strider, Riverrat, Velcro, Sporky, Buttercup, Evie and her friend, Ziptie, Morningsong, Romani, Whiskers, and a couple others camping nearby. The best part of the day was popping out of the trees into a grassy field full of dandelions. I experienced a sense memory that literally stopped me in my tracks. The smell transported me back to my grandfathers farm and I could feel myself standing in the upper fields. It was a beautiful memory brought to life. Day 5 - Raven Rock shelter to Waynesboro PA 5 miles. Long steep descent from the shelter down to PenMar Park for a quick break before crossing the Mason/Dixon line into Pennsylvania. Woohoo we are done with Maryland. 1 state down and 13 to go. As Velcro and I are walking down the road toward Rouzerville to pick up my resupply box a car pulls up and this coupe offers us a ride. He opens the rear hatch and sitting inside is Midnight Strider. I'm sure my jaw was on the ground! We get to the Rouzerville post office to pick up my resupply box which looks like it was rolled through a mud puddle and sat on. Not sure what the hell they did to it. Just up the road from the PO is Bobby D's pizza where we stopped for lunch. There were four of us there (me, Velcro, Capt Panda, and Midnight Strider). We order our food and sit down and the guys take turns going to the restroom. Meanwhile Velcro is sitting there waiting and when the last of us comes back she says ""ok my turn"" and we all just start laughing and remind her that there's a ladies room and not just a privy. After that we called a shuttle to take us to Cascades PO to pick up Velcro's resupply and then into Waynesboro to the Days Inn. Since I'm taking a zero day tomorrow it means our little trail family is breaking up since Velcro, Capt Panda, and Midnight Strider are moving on. One of the things I was worried about was whether I would be able to find some cool, like minded people to hang out with. What I have found is that everyone on the trail is so open and friendly and fun to be around.","Harpers Ferry WV

Stumblefoot (aka Marginal),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529443,"Day 6 - Zero day in Waynesboro PA. I spent the day doing errands (read laundry) and shopping for my resupply. Unfortunately no place in town sells the gas cartridges I need for my stove so I will be eating cold breakfasts this week so I can save my remaining fuel for dinners. I also shipped home a couple maps I no longer need, spare headphones (wtf ""spare""...?!?), a plug adapter I won't need, and the extra meals I won't be eating due to the fuel situation.","Waynesboro PA

Stumblefoot (aka Marginal),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530441,"Day 7 - Pen Mar park to Tumbling Run shelter 8.5 miles. It was strange hiking by myself after a week with the group. I put in my headphones and arrived at the Deer Lick shelter by 11 where I stopped for lunch. I had passed a large group of Boy Scouts coming down the trail who had stayed there last night. Continued on to Tumbling Run shelter and rolled in around 1 pm. Was considering moving on because it was so early but I'm feeling some pain under my arch on my right foot so decided to stick to my original plan and stay. Apparently all the rocks in Maryland are catching up to me a bit. I had opted for trail runner's for my hike instead of heavy boots but maybe I need the additional stability that a boot would provide. I know that the rocks get worse as you move further into Pennsylvania so I may have to reevaluate my footwear choice once I reach Boiling Springs. Not much I can do at the moment except grin and bear it and hope it doesn't get worse. Met the caretakers of both the Deer Lick and Tumbling Run shelters. Great job by these volunteers who keep the shelters clean and supplied. Day 8 - Tumbling Run shelter to Quarry Gap shelter 12.5 miles. I got my first trail magic today. I had met a guy on the trail early in the day named Mr Nature and we chatted for a bit. He passed me up while I was eating lunch and then I caught him again at Caledonia State Park where he was sitting with his wife who is meeting him certain places along the trail. Anyway as I was walking by he called me over to meet his wife who then asked if I wanted a hot dog. Of course I did so as I'm eating that she asks if I'd like a coke to drink. Well as a matter of fact I'd love a coke. So she gets up and walks to her car and brings back not only a cold coke but also a Ding Dong! Jackpot! After a nice rest I then tackled the big hill leading up out of the park and was grateful for the extra energy. My foot wasn't any better today but it also wasn't any worse so I'm just hiking through the discomfort for now and I'll reevaluate when I get to the next town. It was a warm day and I was glad to finally roll into the shelter. The Quarry Gap shelter that I'm staying at tonight is the nicest one that I have seen so far. It's old, originally built in 1935, but is extremely well taken care of and has a lot of cool touches like the hanging plants and other decorative items. Sharing the shelter tonight is Morning Song, Legs for Days, Mr Nature, and a couple of SOBO's. Day 9 - Quarry Gap shelter to Tom's Run shelter 13.5 miles. I have determined with absolute precision that the speed of smell is 1.5 mph. How do I know this you may ask. I'll tell you how. I stink. I mean, I...smell...bad. As you might expect of someone who is hiking for 8 hrs a day in the heat wearing the same clothes day after day without benefit of a shower. So when I am walking on nice level ground my speed is around 3 mph and at that speed I don't smell myself. However when I hit a big uphill climb my speed slows to about 1 mph and I can definitely smell myself, which as I mentioned is not a good smell. Since I am averaging 2 mph across all types of terrain and I don't smell myself all the time the speed of smell must be between 1 and 2 mph. Also I passed the halfway point on the trail if you had started in Georgia. My halfway point will be somewhere in Maine. Sharing the shelter tonight with Sporky and his fiancé Buttercup, Blueberry and her brother Big Berry, legs for Days and her dog Blaze, and a couple others. Also today was super warm and my feet hurt. That is all. Day 10 - Tom's Run shelter to James Fry shelter 11 miles. Cold rainy day today. Topped at the Pine Grove Furnace general store which is the nominal halfway point. Had a fantastic cheeseburger and watched Scorched Heels complete the half gallon challenge. What is the half gallon challenge you ask? The challenge is to eat a half gallon of ice cream by yourself in one sitting to mark completing half the trail. Since I've not completed half the trail, and since it was cold and rainy, I chose to pass. The flip-flop hikers have been talking about creating our own halfway challenge up on Maine. I'm thinking it should have something to do with lobster. Also, I got lost today for the first time. It was totally not all my fault as I know at least 3 other people who also made the same wrong turn I did. The intersection was not well marked and I started down a side trail that roughly paralleled the AT and had walked about 20 mins before I realized it. I didn't want to backtrack so I checked my gps and saw I was about 1/2 mile off trail. I took a bearing and bushwhacked back to the AT. I'm sure Eric and Mike will read this and have some choice commentary. Sharing the shelter tonight with Legs for Days and her dog Blaze, and Sporky and his fiancé Buttercup. Blueberry and Big Berry ran out of food and had to hitch into town to resupply. Day 11 - James Fry shelter to Boiling Springs,PA 12 miles. The early bird gets the worm, but the first hiker on the trail gets all the spider webs. Today was a really rough day. It rained all day and only got to about 55 degrees. I hiked the first 7 miles to the Alex Kennedy shelter over a bunch of rocky knobs. I don't know why the trail boss feels we need to visit every insignificant rock pile in the state instead of taking us through some nice pastures and by farms. I had planned to hole up and rest and have lunch out of the rain. When I got there however I found that someone had thrown up all over the floor of the place and there was a note warning of possible Norovirus. So just a quick stop to get a granola bar and I was off again. The rain got worse and the temps dropped further. By the time I made it to Boiling Springs I was on the verge of hypothermia. My hands were so cold that my phone wouldn't even register my touch and I had to have a stranger unlock and dial my phone for me. I called some friends who were at the Allenberry hotel and got directions. A long hot shower and Chinese delivery food soon had me feeling better. After checking with the other hikers I found out that the sick hiker was actually Scorched Heels, the guy who had done the ice cream challenge the day before. Also finally caught up with Velcro, Captain Panda, and Midnight Strider and spent the evening trading stories. Also apparently the Allenberry Hotel is the epicenter of brown trout fly fishing and they actually have a trout fishing hall of fame in the banquet room. Who knew?","Waynesboro, PA
","Boiling Springs, PA","Apr 29, Fri",0
Stumblefoot (aka Marginal),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531549,"Day 12 - Rest day in Boiling Springs. I took advantage of my rest day to visit the local outfitter which was a fly fishing shop. Fortunately they had a small hiking area in the store that had the canister fuel I needed. As it turns out they also carried a small selection of hiking boots. Since my feet were already killing me and the rocks were going to get worse soon I decided to go ahead and buy new boots. I got some Oboz high top boots with a good stiff sole which should help with the tenderness on the bottom of my feet. Later my 2nd cousin Karen Coleman drove over from the next town with her mom Barbara Johnston and picked me up to spend the night at her house. We stopped for an early dinner and then went to the grocery store so that I could resupply. Afterward my cousin Mark Johnston (Karen's brother) stopped by and we spent the evening talking. A very enjoyable visit. Day 13 - Mechanicsburg, PA to Duncannon, PA 14.5 miles. Karen and I had breakfast at a diner and then she dropped me off at the trailhead to continue my hike. The day was overcast and cool but the rain held off and I made good time up the trail. Early in the day I passed the 100 mile mark for my hike. The new boots did what I expected them to do and probably saved me from a sprained ankle 3 or 4 times. Also I made it through a long tough day with no blisters or hot spots so I'll call that a success. The amount and nastiness of the rocks continued to increase so I am really glad I didn't wait until Port Clinton to switch out my footwear. Unfortunately it also means that I am now traveling with 3!!! pairs of shoes. My new boots, my old shoes, and my camp shoes (Crocs). I won't have the opportunity to send my old shoes home until Port Clinton in 5 more days. Also I was able to catch up to Capt Panda, Midnight Strider, and Velcro today so the gang is all back together, at least for a little while. CP and Strider will be leaving the trail on May 9 for about 2 weeks to attend to business and family matters so I'm glad to be able to have one more week with them before they go. Day 14 - Duncannon, PA to Peters Mountain shelter 11.4 miles. Another really rough day. It was cold and raining all day with the temps around 45. Also I spoke too soon about my ankles being saved as my left ankle feels like it has a mild sprain from all of the twisting from the rocks. Plus, I lived up to my trail name again when I slipped on a wet rock and smashed my knee. The rest of the day was spend hobbling through low hanging clouds. All I wanna do right now is go home and nurse my wounds. The shelter here is quite big with room for over a dozen people which is good because we have a full house tonight. In addition to our regular crew we also have Chill-lax, Swiss Miss, Lost and Found, Keebler, Bear Snack, Peter and the Wolf, and a couple others. Day 15 - Peters Mtn shelter to Yellow Springs campsite 13.5 miles. It's amazing what 12 hrs sleep and an Aleve can do. My knee feels ok if still tender. Today marks 6 years since my dad passed away. I miss him all the time but I know he'd be so pleased that I was out here hiking this great trail. Day started out cold and rainy again but around noon it started to clear up. I was supposed to do 18 miles today but I haven't been able to manage more than 15 so far. My plan calls for several days in the 17-19 mile range (such optimism) which I thought by now I'd be able to do. I will have to adjust my schedule and maybe give up my rest days to make up time. I was passed today by three young hikers who had started in Georgia in Feb. They went by me like I was standing still, almost twice my speed, moving like their ankles and knees don't hurt. I hate them. Day 16 - Yellow Springs campsite to unnamed campsite 10 miles. What a crappy night. The storm started shortly after dark and it rained steadily all night. I woke up at 2 am to a small lake inside my tent. It seems while asleep I had pushed the inner liner of the tent outside the outer flap and so rain was running down the side of the tent directly into the inside. Crap. So I spent a 1/2 hour literally bailing my tent out. In addition my sleeping bag liner got soaked and my sleeping bag itself was damp in places. The day was cold and rainy to start but the rain stopped before noon and the sun even peeked through in the late afternoon. The highlight of my day was seeing over a dozen red efts. These small orange salamanders apparently are only this color when they are young and turn green as they age. I think I may adopt it as my spirit animal. Day 17 - Unnamed campsite to 501 shelter 12 miles. Guess the weather. Go ahead and guess. I'll wait. RAIN!!!You're shocked I can tell. It has been over a week since we've had a sunny day. At least I managed to not flood my tent again. It rained all night again and into the morning and drizzled off and on into the afternoon. It remained cold and foggy all day. I'm actually thinking that a 110 degree Arizona day might not be so bad. It was a moderately long day with a couple of really nasty sections of rock thrown in for good measure. Giant wet rock piles with slippery moss and wet slippery leaves equals me not having happy feet and ankles. But there is hope on the horizon. We can order pizza delivered to the 501 shelter so I am motivated to get there. The pizza was good and the soda was carbonated heaven! Sharing the shelter tonight we have Capt Panda, Midnight Strider, Velcro, Lewis, Towsack and wife, and Peter and the Wolf. Day 18 - Rest day in Pine Grove, PA. We caught a shuttle into Pine Grove where Velcro has a new pack coming to replace the pack that she got to replace the pack she started with. The constant rain (8 days straight) has worn everyone down and there is supposed to be an even bigger storm tomorrow that will dump 1 1/2 inches of rain so we have decided to take a couple of rest days. We all needed to do laundry and get some resupply and rest our tired feet so this seemed like a good opportunity. It also marks the end of our travels with Capt Panda and Midnight Strider as they will be leaving the trail on Saturday for 2 weeks. I will miss their company and our conversations. Hopefully we will meet up again sometime.","Boiling Springs, PA

Stumblefoot (aka Marginal),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532708,"Day 19 - Second rest day in Pine Grove. The storm we were expecting hit and made us glad we decided not to hike today. Heavy rain on and off all day long. Meanwhile we are nice and cozy in our hotel getting all of our equipment cleaned and repaired. One of my hiking poles snagged on a root a couple days ago and came apart. I was using duct tape to keep it together but today I got some superglue to fix it permanently. The manager of the hotel was nice enough to take Velcro and I to the post office so she could mail her pack back and I could mail my trail runners home. I made reservations with a hostel for our hike tomorrow that will allow us to slack pack for a day. Other than that we are just sitting around watching movies on tv because there is nothing else to do and we're not going to walk far in this rain anyway. Last day with Capt Panda and Midnight Strider. Day 20 - 501 shelter to Hwy 183 9.5 miles. Craig from the Rock'n'Sole hostel picked us up from our hotel and dropped us at the trailhead with our day packs ($3 Dollar General special) for our slackpack day. Velcro and I started up the trail which was quite rocky for a while before easing off a bit. About a mile of the trail was running with water due to all of the rain and there were several impromptu ponds we had to negotiate. We made good time with our lighter loads and were able to reach our pickup point by early afternoon. Craig sent his son to bring us back to the hostel which turned out to be a converted garage on his property. It was very well done and a nice cozy spot for 4 people. Craig's wife Jodi made us an amazing dinner with salad, steamed broccoli, garlic mashed potatoes and open faced London broil with fried onions. The food was amazing and then she brought out ice cream cake for dessert. Needless to say I am a very full hiker right now. Day 21 - Port Clinton to Hwy 183 15 miles. Second day of slackpacking from the Rock'n'Sole hostel. Craig took us to the trailhead in Port Clinton and dropped us off to hike back to the hostel. The trail was about the same as yesterday but the sun was finally shining! After almost two weeks we finally had a sunny day. We met up with a woman named Annalisa and was hiking with her when she almost stepped on a timber rattler that was sunning itself on the trail. She let out quite the scream before running back to us. The snake was eventually persuaded to move off to the side so that we could pass. These last two days staying at the hostel have spoiled us and I'm not sure how we are going to survive going back to the shelters. Craig's wife Jodi is a fantastic cook and has stuffed us with delicious breakfasts and dinners each day. A hot shower in the outdoor stall ends the day. Day 22 - Port Clinton to Windsor Furnace shelter 6 miles. Short day due to need to get resupply box from Port Clinton post office which doesn't open until 12:30pm. So first we got a shuttle to the Cabela's in Hamburg (largest in the world) so I could replace a couple broken tent stakes, get a bug net, and a dry sack. Also they had a fudge shop so had to get a piece for dessert tonight. Then over to the Walmart for lunch items and finally to the post office. After picking up our boxes we sorted through our items, repacked our packs, and headed up the hill out of town. We rolled into the shelter and found a large school group from Philadelphia that was tenting in the area. Needless to say camp was loud until bedtime. Today's mileage gives us 200 miles total. Woohoo we are almost 10% done!Day 23 - Windsor Furnace shelter to Eckville shelter 9 miles. The day started out cold and drizzly and stayed that way all day. A steep climb to start off warmed us up and we pushed through several boulder fields before ending up on old forest service roads into the shelter. We arrived by noon famished, ate lunch, then second lunch, and were considering moving on when the temps dropped and more rain moved in. We quickly changed our minds and claimed a couple of bunks in the shelter for the night. The afternoon passed while we shivered in our bunks. The school group from yesterday showed up and set up their tents in the field across the street. They had pizza delivered veered and offered the leftovers to the shelter dwellers. Then Mr Nature's wife showed up with Wendy's takeout and snacks. Unfortunately I had already eaten dinner so I didn't take any pizza or burgers but I did get a chocolate snack cake. Also in the shelter tonight are Velcro, Sporky, Peter and the Wolf, Mr Nature, and a couple others.","Pine Grove, PA

Stumblefoot (aka Marginal),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533339,"Day 24 - Eckville shelter to unnamed campsite 13.5 miles. My home state is not being very kind. The word for today is rocks. Big rocks, little rocks, rocks that hide under leaves and twist your ankle when you step on them. Rocks that you have to step between and rocks you have to climb over. Here's what I don't understand. You're walking along a perfectly fine bit of trail when all of a sudden there's a sharp turn that takes you up and over some stupid rock pile only to drop right back down the other side to the same elevation you were just at. You can even trace an imaginary line that would connect the two points and see that it would have been nice level trail with NO rocks. Some hikers call Pennsylvania Rocksylvania, others call it the place where boots go to die. I'm going to call it JAFRP from now on, just another frickin rock pile. If I sound cranky it's because my feet and ankles are sore and tired. Only about 5 more days until New Jersey and hopefully some nicer trails. Day 25 - Unnamed campsite to Lehigh Gap 12 miles. Roughest day yet. I tweaked my ankle pretty badly early in the day again and had a hard time over the next 10 or so miles. Fortunately my cousin Christy lives nearby so I called her and asked if she could pick up Velcro and I. While we were waiting we hitched a ride into Palmerton and got a cheesesteak for dinner. We then headed back to Christy's house where I took some Aleve and iced my ankle before getting a hot shower and a soft bed for the night. I just want to say to the Pennsylvania Appalachian Trail maintainers in charge of the northeastern area ""You suck!"" I don't mean that in a ""ha ha shared misery makes us all friends"" kind of way. I mean you are bad at your job. Why are the shelters spaced so far apart in this area? 17 miles between shelters is just ridiculous. Also, why don't the shelters in this area have privies? There's no good reason for that. And your trail crew must be mentally impaired. Why do we have no blazes for large stretches of rocky terrain where the path is difficult to follow and then 3 blazes within 20 feet of each other along a well worn forest path? Again, you suck!Day 26 - Lehigh Gap to Smith Gap 12.5 miles. So after a nice rest last night my ankle was feeling a little bit better. Christy drove us back to Lehigh Gap to slackpack for the day. We started out with a STEEP climb (500 ft in 3/10 miles which equals a 30% grade) followed by a class 5 rock scramble. It was pretty sketchy for a hiking trail. Oh, did I mention that it was raining again? That made the rock climb even more fun. It rained harder as the day went on and as there were no shelters on this part of the trail we had to eat lunch while the standing in the rain. My ankle started bothering me again as we hiked but we made it through to Smith Gap ok and met a SOBO section hiker who invited us into her camper van to wait for Christy to pick us up. Her friend made us some hot tea and we traded stories while warming up. Christy brought us back to her house and cooked us an amazing dinner of stuffed manicotti, asparagus, salad, and rolls.Day 27 - Smith Gap to Wind Gap 8 miles. Christy dropped us off early at Smith Gap for our slackpack day. My ankle continues to bother me and I can't seem to make it through a day without aggravating it at least a couple of times. The rocks continue so almost every step is painful. My hiking poles pick up leaves like a janitor picking up litter in a park. Anyway Velcro and I made it through on what turned out to be a pretty nice day. After our hike we got cleaned up and went into town for dinner at Red Robin. Day 28 - Wind Gap to PA 191 8.5 miles. Another slackpack day on a very weird weather day. Christy joined us on the trail today. Our original plan was for the three of us to hike to Kirkridge Shelter for the night. However Christy was feeling like she might be getting sick plus the forecast was for freezing temps overnight so we decided it would be better to jump off at the highway. The day started cold and windy with some light showers, then the sun poked through for a little bit as a tease before the sky darkened again and rain and light hail began to fall. This pattern repeated a couple times through the day as we hiked the ridge line above Wind Gap. Again, the rocks were prevalent and I basically limped the entire day. I have to decide what to do about my ankle as I can't continue with it like this much longer. May be time to see a doc because the Aleve and ice aren't getting it done.","Eckville shelter
