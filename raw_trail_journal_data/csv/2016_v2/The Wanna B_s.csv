The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518790,"""Preparation for 2016 AT Walk by The Wanna Bs ""Anticipation, anticipation is making me late, is keeping me waiting."" Carly SimonI read so many journals a couple of years ago as well as reading my books about hiking the AT, but I had to start focusing on my job and my family. Now I feel almost like I am starting over. It seems as though the AT is no longer the AT I have read about. I hope all the negative hype I am now seeing is an exaggeration.In any case, the time has come. We decided to do it a year early, thinking that we will be lucky to be able to complete the walk at our age and we best not push it.Now don't take that to mean that we are not determined to finish the hike, for we are. We just recognize that we are not young and the future is uncertain.With that in mind, we have decided to do the less conventional hike and do a flip-flop starting in Harper's Ferry going north then coming back to Harper's Ferry to go South. I gave my first official notice that we were going in 2016 rather as originally planned in 2017 on White Blaze. Every time I spend time planning and dreaming now knowing that the start date is merely a few months away makes my whole body tingle with anticipation. Bob retires this month. I take a leave in March. We hoped to start our hike on our anniversary, April 14th. We found that there is a flip flop festival or kick-off on April 16th and 17th so that fits very closely to our plans.We have done two long hikes before this. One 3 day, 28 mile hike, and one nearly 100 mile, 10 day hike. We have not climbed mountains on either of these hikes so we know it is not comparing apples to apples. I hope that the many who say, ""we trained by hiking"" or ""there is no way to prepare for the AT besides hiking the AT"" are at least partially correct.I also hope also that determination is as important as many say. Now before you weigh in to vote us as ""most likely NOT to succeed, "" realize that I hiked the majority of the 100 mile hike with a stress fracture in my foot and that should speak to my determination. Still there were times during that hike with my foot aching, wet, cold, and discouraged that I said, ""why am I doing this anyway."" Still the satisfaction of accomplishment was wonderful and the beauty of those woods still entices me to do another hike through them. But the call of the AT is strong and loud and grows stronger with every day and every step of preparation. We have our primary gear. We may need to do a little weeding but our weight is down quite a bit. We will be hammock hikers. I want to blog for the benefit of friends and family at home, but am not sure of which venue. I am thinking of doing it as a fund raiser maybe for clean water in impoverished countries as the fact that the 100 mile hike was a fund raiser helped keep me going in spite of intense pain. We have many promises (to ourselves) to keep and much planning and preparation before we hike.",,Katadin then Springer,"Dec 27, Sun",0
The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518810,"Saturday we hiked Cedar Ridge trails about 2.5 miles total with a number of pounds on the back. Next Saturday we will add more pounds and some Saturdays we will add another mile. It is not much but all we have time for while I am working full time and Bob is keeping our home sit by Park Hosting.I think doing the AT as a flip-flop allows us to take our time. I think we will not just hike it to finish but will hike to enjoy every mile, every minute of the challenge. Oh, I've read hundreds of journals and I know it is not a picnic but I am generally not a whiner. Well, I am but I am not a quitter. Well, I am sometimes but not always and I am not going to quit on this dream.",,continued prep,"Dec 28, Mon",0
The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518927,"The beginning of the year of the long awaited AT hike. There is way too much to plan in too little time. Details of the hike and details of our life back home. Where will be store our RV while we are hiking? What will we do with our home when the kids living there return to their mission? Who will take care of our sweet Princess Muffin (Shit-zu) while we are hiking? Transferring from business health care to the market place; what will that entail? Should we also get ""traveler's insurance"" to bring us back home if need be?   Bounce box or no bounce box? Supply boxes with our wonderful dried fruits or supply as we go?   If I keep gaining weight, I will need new trail clothing (especially long underwear). Our shoes are WELL broken in, should we go ahead a break in new ones and start the trail with better shoes? Also we need to go though our storage as some of our hiking gear didn't make it to our RV somehow when we changed living situations back in March. REI garage sale is tomorrow but I do not think there is anything we really know that we need that we don't have. Not really worth standing in line at 6 am at this point. But there is a part of me that thinks we may be missing something.An intense anticipation itself transforms possibility into reality; our desires being often but precursors of the things which we are capable of performing.Samuel Smiles",,continued prep,"Jan 01, Fri",0

We will continue to increase each weekend. We are currently trying to decide on a wilderness first aid course or should we just watch survival videos?

The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519800,"We have taken MLK weekend as an opportunity to check our gear a little more. Found that the very expensive cuban fiber tarp purchased a few years ago is now worthless. Even the dew seeps through making a puddle below the thinning places of the tarp. We are glad to have discovered this before the first rain on the hike.We also took a good long hike with increased weight without notable problem. Again however, there were no climbs. I love the Meme found on facebook today which stated that there is no WiFi in the woods but a better connection. I am looking forward to that better connection. 
86 days before we leave for the trail. We have decided to go by train for a couple of days of restful adventure before we begin the hike of our lives. Tickets are purchased. Reservations have been make in Harper's Ferry.
Resignation letter is written and will be turned in tomorrow. That is the scariest of all. Will there be anything for me when I return from my gallivanting ways?

The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520814,"Wilderness First Aide Course, 12 hours today and 7 hours tomorrow. I think. 
Pretty expensive and some have said, the AT is not a Wilderness. To start the day today, they showed slides of nearby towns that had recently faced the devastation of a tornado. For weeks those areas were in effect a wilderness. No one could get in or our of some areas. Good idea to know first aide where ever you go. Hopefully we will not need the things we are learning today and tomorrow. Hopefully, if we do need them, we will be remember what we learned. 
Another great part is that we met and were able to visit with a couple who hiked in 2014 and hear about their experiences and get some answers to some questions and some great ideas about some side trips and places where they regret not spending more time. Makes me glad we are planning to take it easy and enjoy the ride.

The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522085,We went to get replacement shoes at REI today. I bought some low hikers by Keen. They are actually the same as I had before but I also bought the high impact Superfeet insoles to go into them.I also purchased some Choco's to use to cross the creek and to wear in camp.Bob purchased some Merrell shoes. He plans to wear crocs in camp.I also needed some rubber tips for my ski poles aka hiking poles. Needless to say we purchased a few other items while there including some snow peak titanium cup. We purchased some sock liners for Bev and a few food items to try. Bev's tarp arrived last week. We should be almost set with equipment. We are still in the process of drying food. A load of bananas came out today and a load of stawberries and cherry tomatoes went in.Three weeks left of work for Bev. Bob's given notice at the Park for April 6th.

The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526201,"My NemesisMy first backpacking trip was a few years ago with a group of hangers from Hammockforums.com. They must have had a laugh seeing us in our heavy jeans, heavy coats, and heavy backpacks, especially when we announced our intentions to hike the Appalachian Trail. But what I remember most about that hike was that my knees started hurting so badly that I thought I might end up having to be carried out.On many of the descents, I started just going backwards to ease the pain. On level ground, I walked stiff-legged to give my knees a beak.I don't want you to misunderstand as the young men were kind. One even filled my Nalgeine with boiling water to place in my sleeping bag. This allowed me to survive the 17 degree temperature that February night. They also were free with much needed advice. Therefore, it seemed fitting that we take on Cross Timbers for our final shakedown before heading out to the AT. We are also having trouble getting out pack weight down and more getting the volume down so all fits in the bags. We have a bit more space taken up with home due to the hammock camping style with the tarps above and the underquilts below. It is as if we were carrying two tents (hammocks), with two more tents (tarps) in addition to having to each have two sleeping bags (under quilt and top quilt). It all adds up to a lot of volume.I am looking forward to the hike and what we may learn this time.Bob and Beverly FlachThe Wanna Bs",,Cross Timbers Trail,"Apr 03, Sun",0
The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527040,"It was not without some trepidation that this B of The Wanna Bs faced the giant of Cross Timbers Trail. It is a mere 14 mile trail, but one that years earlier dealt a blow to my confidence. An understanding, patient, and confident partner made all the difference. Taking the trail at my own speed which sometimes meant a quarter of a mile an hour and sometimes 2 miles an hour, resulted in the conquering of this seemingly giant of a mental obstacle. Joys of the trail included two beautiful lakeside campsites and watching both the sunset in one direction over the lake and the amazing sunrise in the other. 
Hiking with our Shitzu. Princess Muffin, provided surprising delights. She loved being ""off -leash."" She probably hiked half again the miles we did, surging ahead then coming back to check on us. She learned that creeks were not scary but refreshing both to drink and cool one's little paws. She ""made friends"" with a small tortoise. She willing allowed me to comb out burrs and caked in mud each evening for the chance to climb into my hammock with me. When exhausted on day three, she willingly slept on the top of my pack and around my neck. The wildflowers were sparce but beautiful. The trail was either going up or down most of the time and I wonder how these climbs will compare to the PUDS of Virginia. I have no delusions that the hike on the AT will be as low of pain as the Cross Timbers Trail, but I am assured that at my pace, coupled with the best partner possible, we can conquer what the trail may bring, despite our ages and arthritis. After working with the geriatric population as a social worker and and now finding myself in that catagory, I have come to love the following quote: ""Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside, totally worn out and proclaiming, 'WOW! What a ride!'""Thanks to Sandy for turning me onto it and to either Hunter S Thompson or Mark Frost for authoring it.

The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527522,"This week has been full of goodbyes. 
Saying goodbye to family and friends is difficult. We had some friends we don't often see over for a camp fire meal and answered their many questions about our planned hike. We were blessed by promises of prayer support. 
We tried to attend at least one of each of our grandchildrens sports events. We had our youngest overnight one night and two that we had not been able to have over in the last several months for special grandparent time another night. 
We attended our daughters wedding. 
We spent a day with my youngest son and his wife then took them to the airport to go back to California where they live. We spent as much time as we could with family but it still wasn't enough. Tonight we enjoyed fellowship with our regular home group and received their prayers. We will miss our family and friends.",,Train to Harpers Ferry ,"Apr 11, Mon",0

Then off to a historical tour of Harpers Ferry with a guide who knew his stuff by heart and was an excellent storyteller. Harpers Ferry has a history filled with significance from the explorers Lewis and Clark to the attack and attempted slave uprising made by John Brown, to the take over by the Confederates then the Union then the Confederates again etc., to the post war meetings of a group called ""the Niagara"" which fought for equal rights and was the beginning of what is now the NAACP, to the establishment of one of the first primary schools to teach freedman the basic education denied them as slaves leading also to the establishment of the first interracial college. These education efforts were strongly fought by the majority of the white population but was instigated by the Freewill Missionary Baptist Church. Our guide caused us to feel deeply the struggles. We then spent some money at an outfitters then took a trail angel, Suzanne, to lunch. Reverse trail magic. We laundered and showered and repacked. My birthday dinner was at The Anvil: a steak with potatoes and salad followed by salted carmel gelato. My favorite!",,Relaxation and Celebration,"Apr 17, Sun",0

M 1023.1 (Harpers Ferry - 1029.4 (Ed Garvey Shelter)First Day on the Hike I read sometime by a previous AT Hiker that ""the destination is the journey.""This is so true and once we stepped on the trail right at the W. Virginia / Maryland border we had reached our destination with the beginning of our journey. We have pictures which I will post under photos if you care to look but they do not do justice to that which we saw with our own eyes. We first walked several miles along the beautiful Potomac river.   See photo of the great Blue Heron we saw. Many turtles were sitting on logs in the stream on the other side of our pathway.   At about 3 1/2 mies came something hikers call ""the shoot."" It consists of a climb of 1000 feet from about 250 elevation to 1250 elevation in a little over a mile and a half. Part way up is a blue blaze trail.5 mile loop trail to a stupendous lookout called Weverton Cliffs. The view was unbelievable. I guess the great thing about the long climb other than that side trip view was the deep foot massage given by the many medium to large sharp rocks on the trail. We also enjoyed seeing 4 deer. I have wondered why the Appalachian Trail is called the root canal if the three National long distance trails, PCT, CDT, and AT (Pacific Crest Trail, Continental Divide Trail, and the Appalachian Trail).   We had a peep of understanding today.At about mile 6 1/4 the trail evened out and we were soon at our shelter with plenty of time to hang our hammocks, eat our dinner, and then hang up the bear bag before going to bed at 7PM.   The rest of the hikers were quiet by 8, hikers midnight and I could hear Bob begin to snore as I was writing this note. He has a more difficult day then I because he took on the job of hiking the.5 miles down 800 ft to the spring to refill our water supply and back up again. It was a big day and we all have another ahead of us.

1033.6. then about.25 miles off trail and a couple of hundred feet down.
Correction on yesterday's post. It was probably more like 400 ft down to the spring but it was very steep and Bob was pretty beat up when he got back up. He related that the trip down was very quiet until he went around the last big rock. At that time he suddenly heard the loud gurgling of the spring. The water came out of a small pipe then into a small pond and back down into the ground, coming out again into another pond about a hundred feet further down and where Bob had the delight of seeing an older fawn deer drinking. 
Today was practically a gnat free day, yeah. Last night as I was sleeping I thought to myself that if someone did an x-ray of my lungs right then they would see a number of small black spots which I would have to explain as simply the number of gnats I inhaled yesterday. Ha!
We woke up today with a glorious sunrise. It took us quite awhile to get away partly due to the knowledge that the next shelter was only 4.2 miles away and the one after that further than we intended to go any one day in our first week. We are determined to take it slowly. 
Bob discovered the probable reason there were no complaints of mice at that first shelter, a large black snake up in a nearby tree (see photo). We also nearly stepped on his brother a couple of miles up the trail. It was fun watching and listening to him slither away in the dry leaves. 
We passed the home of George Allred Townsend, pen-name Gath, a famous war correspondent during the Civil War, early biographer of Lincoln, and a prolific writer including a popular romance novel in his day, now largely forgotten.
He erected a large arch on his land as a memorial to all the war correspondents and news artists of the day from both sides of the conflict. It is very impressive. Impressive also are the number of battle grounds we pass as we hike.
What a sad time in our history!
Simple Joy's of the day: The views, the stone couch (see photos), the absence of gnats, the spring water so cool and refreshing, the stop by a State Park bathroom that had cool clean water AND SOAP, and a shelter to ourselves. 
We are both feeling fine.","Ed Garvey Shelter

The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529514,"4/22/2016. 1059.11652'I made up a song today with a tune you all know. I will share the words with Harmony and task her with teaching all the cousins. It is about the AT.We went further than we maybe should today but had decided that if we made it a big day today. We would have enough food to make it to Waynesboro tomorrow with a short day... shower, laundry, and resupply and could go to church on Sunday before starting on again. We pushed ourselves hard and over some very tough trail made entirely of boulders and often either steep ups or steep and treacherous downs (see picture but it doesn't trek the full extent). The last climb up to Rock Raven Shelter was a doozy. Yet they tell us that from here to PenMar where we will get off to go to Waynesboro will be rougher yet and will be much like what we will experience for the month or so we spend on Pennsylvania. We are really beat up. This shelter is a new one and is very nice. We got here so late and so tired we decided to sleep on the floor with our thin mats and one quilt below us and one above. I mean we were wiped out. There is no way to explain how difficult this is. There is nothing like it in Texas. We met several nice section hikers along the way. Tow truck was here and a young man who hasn't taken a trail name yet. He claims to have started in Georgia and planning on making it to Katahdin by July 18th. He says he has a sponsor which I know is possible but he sure seemed like a lot of talk. That kept the rest of us quiet.We spent some time hiking and praying, sometimes Bob sings, mostly we watch carefully where we put our feet and desperately try to breathe. It seems I am always trying to catch my breath. This is why I have taken the individual name of Breather. I have given Bob the name Backer because he is so sweet to always have my back. These names may not stick but in our hiking world it is good enough to be known as The Wanna Bs. We always explain our name that we want to be faithful to God, faithful to each other, and faithful to the trail. Everyone we have met seemed to like it.","Pogo Memorial Campground

It was every bit as difficult today as we had been warned but we did it without a fall and without an injury.We wanted to stay at the bed and breakfast in Waynesboro but it was full.

Velcro was here yesterday and Stumblefoot was able to text her to find out if the earring I found at the last shelter was hers as I suspected. It was. She texted back a picture to be sure. I gave it to him as he will more likely be able to catch up to her.We all went to dinner together and the group favored us by finding a place that served breakfast at night. I was hungry for some real eggs.We have looked but haven't yet found a church with an early morning service. We just can't wait till after an 11:00 service and do all our hiking in the heat of the day. I haven't given up. We did our resupply shopping at dollar general to skip four blocks of walking.

The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529706,"4/24/161071.1869'The last couple of miles were all down hill and not too bad.We worshiped with an AG Church this morning. It was a great refreshment. They sang much loved old hymns and praise songs.We had one speed thru Hiker tell us we would ""get our legs"" on the fourth day another said that we would ""get our legs"" after 400 miles. No one has told us when we would get our lungs.We had a big climb out of Waynesboro this morning. This is how my climbs go. I keep my eyes to the ground to watch for best footing, careful to avoid wiggling rocks, looking for the best way up to protect my knees. Then I run out of breath and stop at the first semi-level area to catch my breath. Then I look around and the wonder that I am actually on the trail as well as the splendor of the trail takes my breath away in a different way. I praise the Lord. So fun also when in the middle of a road of larger boulders and rocks a wild violet pops up its head or another mile down in a similarly unlikely spot, a bunch of miniature daisy looking beauties.I fear that I sometimes might be giving the wrong impression. The trail is extremely difficult. It is extremely challenging. That is what makes it worth doing. I am beat up each night that we push ourselves a little, but at the same time very satisfied. My heart is full. I have loved ones cheering for me. I have a husband so supportive that he bought into the dream, and still willing to do it at the pace I need to go. Today we met Mr. Nature and Silvercloud, and others.   We ended up at the same shelter that River-rat made it to and meet Me Nature here. Mr Nature is being supported by his wife who does the tourist thing while he hikes then once every three days of so, he gets off and helps her move the motorhome on up the road. The people we met come from all sections of the population. Sad is the number we meet trying to work out War shock, commonly known as PTSD. There may be another misunderstanding of the trail due to my mentioning of all the names. I do this mainly for my benefit so I will better remember. Ninety-nine percent of the time Bob and I are hiking, we are alone with each other, the Holy Spirit, our prayers, and our thoughts. Not another person in sight, Judy the beauty of our surroundings. Many of our meetings on the trail last about 30 seconds or so. If we stop to eat at a shelter we might visit longer and when someone else is at the same shelter for the night, we visit for a little while after we have set up our hammocks, set up for the bear bag, and prepared our dinner. Even then the visit isn't very long because hikers midnight is 8 and we are almost ready to sack out. Tonight our hammocks are right beside a very loud stream. It is a very soothing sound.

The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529828,"1078.91539'Today was a relatively easy day compared to recent days so we can't figure out why we are so exhausted. Still very rocky trail much of the time.There was a blue blaze ( side trail) that we took out to another beautiful Overlook. The site was called Chimney Rock but I failed to picture why it had that name. We took off our packs as we started out that side trail. The scramble up the rocks reminded me of rock climbing in Utah as a kid. The break from our packs and view refreshed both our bodies and spirits. I saw a lot of butterflies today, little black ones dancing together, big black ones, some with white on the tail some with bright blue on the tail. My favorite though and the one I saw the most was a small light blue one that in the right light looked like an irredescent violet. This one was either following me along for a couple of miles or relaying butterfly friendship my way. Every time I see a butterfly anymore I think of my sweet Princess Butterfly Ada, our grand daughter, who was mesmerized by a butterfly outside of RV window when she visited is while we lived at Wycliff. I am having a great time reading the trail log posts of my new friends Zip-tie who is always ahead of us. Her cheerful humor is delightful, a true gift.   There are log books in all shelters but I don't always remember to read them or write in them. We set up our hammocks inside a shelter thinking there would only be us and maybe River-rat. The are actually two small shelters at this location. Soon a young man named Marathon arrived. He started in Georgia late February. Later two locals arrived but fortunately they were setting up tents outside the shelter. You can see our set up in photos. It is 8:00, Hiker Midnight, so I am going to post this then go to sleep, I hope.BreatherP.S.

At some of the highest peaks we could hear the thunder from afar so really tried to hurry.   Skies had cleared by the time we got down.

Trying to keep up this journal is the only thing that keeps me on track. We had the longest day of hiking hours and the most miles today. I had fall four and five. The second one, #5, I was sure I was going to fall smack on my face. STOP LAUGHING, grandchildren. Something inside told me to roll so I actually fell on the edge of the pack then rolled back to my shoulder. No injuries during either fall yet pulled a thigh muscle trying to stand up after a rest later on.   This made the last 3 miles and especially the last half of a mile with its steep downhill slow and painful.For part of yesterday and much of today the trail was either lined with Rhododendron plants or they were at least scattered along the trail. I had read about this phenomenon many times in the journals, the experience beautifully described with all senses involved and I was really looking forward to this part of the trail. Unfortunately, we arrived before the blossoms. :-( For the most part except a few step up and downs the trail was almost level and there were even parts where the ground was soft and the rocks were few. We were hiking the mountain ridge and unlike in Maryland the ridge was kind. We hiked several hours in the rain worth ponchos on. They worked great covering our packs as well as our selves. They are called ""backpacker parkas"" and we got then from REI. 
We stopped at a shelter for lunch and a longer rest but mostly to read Zip-tie's log. Again it provided the humor I need. She wrote an Ode to Gorp. It was great.
We are still in Rocksylvania as the hikers call this state and we are told the worst comes in the North. We can take it! I do need to start picking up my feet though. It always seems to be the straggling foot that trips me. We set up under a picnic Pavillion tonight. Bob's great idea.A group of through hikers arrived one or two at a time after we arrived. The first two were Salt and Waffles. This nice couple let me use some of their icey hot on my thigh muscle. The rest I have not met. Maybe in the morning. One was wearing a kilt. Two had hiked 40 miles today supposedly. They all started in Georgia in the early spring, so they are all tough nuts. They are also young and agile. Today we passed the 2016 half way point (yes, it changes). We took a picture at the sign even though it in no way is our half-way point. Our psychological half -way will be the terminus in Maine, MT Katahdin. Our actual half-way point will be a good deal south of Harpers Ferry. We will try to take a picture there as well. Prayer needs on the trail:   Bob's back, Bob's joints especially his left thumb, my left upper thigh, my right knee, and my deformed and clumsy feet.

The trail goes right through this little town. The general store caters to hikers but is not usually open this time of year. We shared a hamburger and a large salad plus fries. It was the best hamburger I have ever had! The salad was also wonderful, fresh and crisp. This is the place that thru hikers from Georgia do the ice cream challenge so we watched some try. Waffles did the best but after the quart and a half carton, she could not go for the extra pint it would take to make it a half gallon.The hike out of Pine Grove was poorly marked and we could have easily gotten lost if we didn't backtrack to the last white blaze and try again.We were unable to make it to a shelter so we had to stealth camp. Bob and I shared his tarp as we were able to find three trees to use for our hammocks, both tying to one then out to the other two. It was wonderful not to have to set up my tarp. I had a chill to my bones and wasn't very helpful. We didn't cook.

He was angry about it.Someone named Bookworm caught up with us, another thru Hiker from Georgia who started in February.   He wanted to know if we had seen Biscuit which we had. He was hiking with him before he took time out to zero with family and was trying to catch back up to him. He was another Hiker wearing a kilt. He warned us that Bananas would be catching up to us soon.She was not far behind him. Maybe an hour.We went through a part of the AT called the Pennsylvania Rock Maze. The young people evidently love it, we, not so much. But it was different and a challenge. There was one place I could not NOT get up onto the next rock. It was about four and a half feet up and in a narrow area between rock walls. We threw or poles and packs up then Bob helped shove me up. I asked Zip-tie how she did it. She said she threw her poles up then hand hauled. I was imagining these young people climbing up the two walls like the grandchildren climb up a door frame then getting on it that way. I know one thing for sure. This part of the trail has changed since Grandma Gatewood hiked it. Saw some beautiful flowers today.

Boiling SpringsNever does a hot shower feel so good as when you have been hiking day after day for 5 or more days without one. Today we hiked only a few miles it appears but it seemed like many more as we climbed three peaks them descended forever into farm land around Boiling Springs, in the Cumberland Valley. Our last mile was through farm land. Not far enough away was the smell of a chicken farm.I think maybe we were further back on the trail last night than our GPS showed and we hiked 6 today. Anyway today we are 2 miles short of 100.The neatest thing that happened today was meeting Bear Bell and Grasshopper on the trail early in the morning. They section hike. How wonderful it would be to live near enough to the trail to do that! We had a great visit with them. They read along on people's journals like we did for so many years. Then when we arrived in Boiling Springs there was a little bag of trail majic waiting for us at the ATC.   It had snickers in it so we took one with thanksgiving then found it was prepared and put there by Bear -Bell and Grasshopper. We went out for pizza with Zip -tie and Shoelace. The pizza was excellent. Shoelace started in Harpers Ferry last Saturday. Zip -Tie leaves out tomorrow. I told her she needed to stay ahead of me so I could read her log entries.Tomorrow we hope for Church then a short resupply figuring on another in Duncannon.

We quickly hiked three blocks up the street to the Lutheran Church and enjoyed the service there. I have never been to a Lutheran Church before but it was quite like the Episcopalian services.   Now that I know Jesus and can understand the litergy, I love this type service in many ways. I love how every service includes a prayer for the sick, for the poor, for the church, for the nation, and more. I love how every service includes at least three readings from the new testament and a psalm. I love how communion is always a part of the service. The hymns however, have a verigated meter that is hard to follow. Regular attendees can't follow them. But I praise God, this is the third Sunday it has worked out for us to worship with a group of believers and it has just happened to be three different denominations but always the same God, the same Christ, and wonderful people of God. We shared a shuttle to Walmart and resupplied enough to get to Duncannon where we will resupply again. I missed fruit last resupply so we may have overdone the fruit this time plus we purchased two apples for a bedtime snack and two bananas for breakfast. Craving healthy. No one to split boxes with so we ended up with a bit to add to the hiker box at the ATC  Felicia, Aniles may be the best pizza on the trail but of course we haven't tried them all.

We picked up our little box with the next few sections of maps then put our extras from the resupply and Zip -Ties extras into the hiker box at the ATC office. Then we hiked the half mile down to the trail head. Funny how much we hate to hike that extra half mile. Ha!We were told that the trail today would be very easy but boring as we hiked through farmers fields. We did find it easy but not boring at all. We actually were hiking through little forest glen like areas that bordered the fields and only occasionally went through a field. We crossed wooden styles to get from one field to another which was a new experience. The first two were slippery as Zip-tie had warned us. The Glens were full of wild flowers and birds songs. How I wish I knew the names of the flowers and the identity of the birds songs! On a blaze post on the middle of one of the fields we saw a red - winged black bird. It was a beautiful sight to watch it take wing.I had trouble almost day with my left ankle and some crazy leg pain on the same side. We traveled into the Days Inn on Highway 11 and checked in. My glasses were broken (just lost the screw to my earpiece) so we contacted our new trail angel friend Grasshopper who not only have us a ride to the CVS for a repair kit but also treated is to supper and a wonderful visit. We were unable to fix the glasses due to something about spring loaded. I now have duck traped glasses and will have to be very careful. This was another wonderful day on the trail.

Rabbit had started in Georgia in February. He said he regretted the rush involved in keeping up with a group and wished he'd spent more time at falls areas enjoying the beauty.Received a sweet note from Bear Bell today. She missed getting together with us last night and sent us her favorite verse :""Cause me to hear Thy loving kindness in the morning; for in Thee do I trust. Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto Thee. Teach me to do Thy will; for Thou art my God."" Psalm 143:8,10It is one of my favorites as well. Nice to find a kindred spirit on the trail.The hike today was as Grasshopper had told us, even more beautiful than the day before. Some of the trail followed a small brook. There were some very nice bridges to get us over streams and creeks (see pics) and the 700 for climb in the last mile wasn't bad at all except that I am still having trouble with my ankle. This allowed us down a lot. I must take it easy and let it rest even though we probably could make it the 6 miles to the next shelter before dark. This is very frustrating to me but Bob is taking it all in stride.   Set in the wall on the side of the trail coming up was a stone couch from which we could view the valley as if on top of the world.

He is doing this hike as a fund raiser for the leukaemia / lymphoma society. I felt the presence of God in the midst of my despair.   I prayed and cried most of the night then woke to a fog so thick I almost couldn't find the privy. It was a crisis situation, but ended well. Funny that we woke up thinking only 6 miles today. We had been warned by Zip -tie that the last three are ""murder"" so we certainly hoped the fog would lift. We got and early start however and decided to try to make it all the way to Duncannon instead of stopping at Cove Shelter. We wanted to Skype with our daughter, a poor substitute for holding her tight, crying and praying with her. The trail was even tougher than we thought possible. Some of it involved a long steep series of rocks, some set and some not set, climbing down down down and on the edge of a possible great fall. I was extremely nervous and Bob was also but refused to show it. I fell twice today, fall six and seven. As a result I turned my ankle and bruised a rib. It was very difficult for Bob to see me struggling in pain. Ahead we are always warned that it us worse. Today that was true.Both Giggles and Survivor, our shelter mates passed us in the afternoon, and the two section hikers with Otis passed us even earlier. The more fit find it difficult but not as difficult as we find it. When we arrived in Duncannon we sought a bed with Wi-Fi. We found The Red Carpet Inn and a young man who was day hiking have us a ride to it. It was several miles from anywhere but we got to talk to our daughter who is keeping a brave face. She assured is that she has a great support system including her siblings and the church family.   Her mother -in -law is also available to help.We are torn due to a great desire to be with them at this time. Here we have nothing practical we can do to help except pray as we hike. There, it appears there is not much we could add besides our prayers. So we decide that after a zero to allow some healing, we will continue to hike and pray.We are both very discouraged due to the injuries and the worries at home. It is not a walk in the woods and the difficulty can not be explained accurately. The hike rumor that the ATC paid someone in PA big money to turn over all rocks on the trail so the sharp edge would face up does not even begin to address the difficulty with unsteady or slippery rocks, steep ups or downs with a cliff on one edge of the tower of rocks you must climb.

This time as the last time it was my pole slipping out from under me that caused the fall. Today if I stepped down too far, my rib hurt.

Suddenly a large black butterfly landed on the trail before them.   It's wings were spread out showing the bright irredescent blue on the tail. ""Quick!"" said the maiden we must capture a picture for our sweet Princesses.   The squire tried to get the camera set in time but just as he was about to take the picture the haughty butterfly flew away with her nose in the air.   The maiden called out softly, please come back. Our Princess would be so cheered by a picture of you.   The black butterfly ignored her pleas. 
A little blue -violet butterfly danced around the maidens head and offered to let them take a picture of her. But when she came to a stop on the trail, she was unable to keep her wings open and with them closed, she looked just like all the brown leaves that were scattered on the trail. Sadly the maiden rejected her offer. A larger red-orange butterfly flew by and also offered to let them take a picture of her for the princesses. Again however, when this butterfly posed for the picture it also was unable to keep its beautiful wings open and so it too blended in with the leaves on the ground. Once again, the maiden had to reject the offer.
Just as the squire and the maiden were about to give up, a very large yellow butterfly flew three times around the squires head then three times around the maidens head then landed on the ground before then keeping her wings spread wide.

The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532842,"1188.91416'I forgot to mention the great trail magic yesterday at the motel.   We ask the desk if they had a shuttle to the diner, about a mile and a half away. They did not but said they would mention our need to another guest who they thought was planning on going that way.   An elderly Southern Baptist couple not only gave us a ride down there but dined with us (Dutch), then sat and talked with us there while Bob went back and forth to the travel center next door to do the laundry.   They love to camp and hike. He hiked the Grand Canyon with a son in law when he was 70 and again at 72. He went back to school in his late 50s, as I did, and received his masters in Social work. He then became a marriage counselor.   The difference being that he already had a great retirement from Dupont. We learned about their courtship and life and testimony. It was absolutely delightful. We resupplied at dollar general next to The Red Carpet Inn where we stayed. Have I mentioned that I am sick of rice? The jambalaya is still good though with pepperoni and salami. There were not many choices at this dollar general and they didn't have indicated individual wrapped Spam that is so good on the trail but the desk clerks were very helpful and one went out to his car and brought in some stamps so I could mail a card to my granddaughter and wouldn't let me pay him. More trail magic.We got a shuttle back to where we left off yesterday and shared the ride with the couple from Alabama, Pete and Be Happy.   They were picked up at a different motel and we returned to a different spot on the trail but it was nice to see then again.Today, without rain, the trail was much easier. The boulder fields were even kind of fun. We could go from flat rock to flat rock lots of times instead of slippery slanted rock to slippery slanted rock. It was more like a game than going through a mine field. Because it was a nice day and we are getting a little stronger and the trail was a little easier we were able to do little more. Still, I was exhausted when we arrived at the William Penn shelter and with a chance of rain, I was willing to suffer sleeping on the floor with nothing but a window sunscreen under me rather than find a place to hang the hammock and tarp.   Bob found a way to hang his inside the shelter, between ladders to the loft. I wish we had taken a picture. He let me have his pad but it fails to keep air. It was something though. We forgot to take a picture of the set up again. Want to post the hammock set ups on Hammock forum eventually.
30 minutes after we arrived we heard a child's cry. Sure enough a mother with her four boys, ages 4-13, arrived. They were all cute but loud and full of energy. They were going to sleep in the loft and it was up and down and out and in and up and down again for a good while. They may have been playing tag. They did try to get quiet once we bedded down. They had hiked to the shelter for an over night.   Another couple slightly younger than ourselves came in and slept against the wall behind the hammock.   After we were asleep another hiker arrived and set up on the floor down below the head of Bob's hammock, No Regrets, Fifty -six and Shaunshine.","443 and 72

It actually took awhile for anyone to pass us. They must have been taking their time with breakfast. HA! The trail was relatively easy again today. There was maybe 3/4 of a mile of boulders but, again, it was not raining and they were kind of fun. We had a short day today only going to the 501 shelter. At this shelter it is a tradition to order Pizza but our friends, No Regrets and Fifty -six, had already ordered and were willing to split the cost with us. Bob and I set up our hammocks and joint tarp using our three tree set up.

The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533106,"1202.5 I spend the day as I hike mostly vigilant about where I should step, praying for whoever comes to my mind and heart from back home as well as those I have met on the trail. I feel the lovely breezes, smell the wonderful fragrances of the forest, hear the beautiful songs of the birds, see the intricate designs and variety of colors and shapes surrounding me when all of a sudden, from about two to three yards behind me comes the full and lovely song of my husband, ""Oh Lord my God, when I on awesome wonder..."" or a praise chorus and I am in heaven. I can't join in much because I can't hike and breath and sing at the same time but my heart and mind join in. I am so thankful that Bob decided to hike with me. He is the icing on the cake. However, later today as we were traversing some very rocky trail, I heard ""Tiptoe through the ro-ocks, won't you follow me, and Tiptoe through the ro-ocks with me... Oh- oh"" It rained much of the night and was still raining in the morning so it was hard to get started. Everything had to be packed before we took the tarp down. Today's trail was difficult mainly because it was raining all day-today...well until about 2:00. It wasn't just sprinkling. It was pouring. I was soaked to the skin. I can't stand to wear the rain jacket because I end up soaked in it anyway with perspiration. I can't stand the poncho because it, also, makes me sweat and I can't see due to the hood. If I keep moving, I can stay warm even though I am soaked. There were several areas of large boulder fields today. Once after a good long way the trail through these boulders, the trail went sharply downhill...so, according to Bob, we would not miss the chance to walk through the large boulders at the bottom of the hill. Once we had hiked perilously through them, the trail headed back up the mountain. It was not what you would call fun in the rain, but not as bad as some previous ones. It was the long swampy trails that became tiresome but the woods they were in the middle of were delightful. Sometimes when I get discouraged while hiking I remind myself, "" you are on the actual Appalachian Trail and you are hiking it."". I cheer up. I am living a dream though Bob says it is sometimes more like a nightmare. We saw a couple of tiny orange frogs in the swampy area.. Their camouflage was perfectly matched to the fallen leaves. We also saw some wild orchids today. We were told by a local that they are called lady's slipper.   We were so thankful when the rain dissipated at 2 rather than at five per the forecast but we were still thoroughly wet when picked up by our shuttle. I saw another little chipmunk today as well.We came to 183 and joined Zip-tie in the hostel (Rock and Soul Hostel) where she was staying . It was a reasonable price and it includes breakfast and supper and free ride to the dollar store, to the trail, and to church on Sunday. We also plan to do some slack packing on Sunday after church. We have decided to go to a regular service on Sunday instead of the early service so as not to miss the full worship experience. Saturday will be a zero to pick up my new shoes from the post office and a pad from Cabella's (I hope). This hostel will shuttle us to the post office and Cabella's and slack pack us a bit. Slack packing on Sunday will get 5 miles if the trail done but will mean walking an extra 2 and a half twice to get up to the trail at a midpoint. My daughter-in-law, Ashley, hopped right on it when I texted her that I needed her to send the box with the new shoes in it asap. I am very thankful to her for this. I am hoping they will help my ankle issues. My shoes wear irregularly and are now worn so badly that they throw my feet to the inside. Bob was going to invest in some new boots at Cabella's but the hiker box here at this hostel had some practically new ones left on the hiker box just his size(13). He is going to wear them all day tomorrow and Sunday before he decides to send his others home. A hiker box generally has things you don't want just as the hiker who unloaded them there didn't want them. Sometimes there are the extra packets of food as when someone had to purchase a packet of ten and only needed three, etc. And perhsos that food item is just what you need.We are going to go through our packs and send anything we are not using or think we can get along without to our son John who has promised to resupply us with items that we later discover we can't live without. This is to try to shed some weight from our packs. I am going to switch from the poncho to a simple backpack cover. That should save some weight. I will also be getting rid of my heavy long underwear. Bob will be looking for a smaller knife at Cabella's and sending back his Leatherman as well as his big flashlight (mini-mag).My granddaughter finished her first round of Chemo. We pray that it is effective with minimal side effects. We continue to pray for each member of that part of our heart as they face considerable stress.   Sorrow hits like waves pushing us to prayer often. I am always worried about running out of water so I drink less than I should and I worry about running out of phone battery so I miss messages.   I basically get on and get off the phone while on the trail. I think to myself that I will catch up at the next town stop but when a town stop comes along there is laundry, resupply, eating of fresh food, and showers to take and I never get caught up. If you really need to catch me, text me. I will see it at night before I sleep at least. We have never completely run out if water or batery charge yet. I do check guest book entrys more regularly now.","501

She is totally awesome hiking this trail by herself, keeping her faith, and cheering all hikers as she goes. Finished her blog from the start and I see why she is doing so well. She did a much better job of preparing for this hike. Hope to see her again but in reality it is unlikely as she will be several days ahead tomorrow. She has already covered that portion of the trail Bob and I will be doing tomorrow and the next day. The hostel she introduced us to is beyond awesome. Staying in hostels and getting to know locals is a part of the trail experience. The owner of this one is a retired state police officer. He is young. Although the official name of the place is Rock and Sole, he calls it his ""shed and breakfast"" though the price of a stay also includes a dinner.   His wife is a premiere cook.   Tonight we had Chicken Florentine and a delicious salad followed by Banana cake. For breakfast we had an egg/veggie casserole with crumbled sausage and toast along with a bowl of cut fresh fruit. The first night we had some pulled pork sandwiches, spinach / strawberry salad, potato gratin, and coleslaw. I would love to be adopted by this family. Today we took a zero and picked up my package from the post office (my new shoes) along with a sweet card from my son and daughter in law and two of my sweet grandchildren.   I love your artwork Whitney and Claire. Thank you. Thank you also Ashley. We also went to Cabella's and purchased the sleeping pads I wanted, a smaller knife for Bob and a new headlamp for me. Mine does not work right when it is misty. I hope this one will. No way to test that out. We would have packages ready to send to John to hold for us but we accidentally picked up a military flat rate box instead of a regular one. We will go to church with our hosts in the morning then they will take us to the trail and we will see if we can do a whole day in a half day when slack packing. Craig, the owner, told us about a way up to the trail (half the distance to Port Clinton) that supposedly passes some nice waterfalls. We will see. It is called Sandy Springs Trail. It means 2 1/2 miles longer walk tomorrow and Monday (5 extra miles total) but doable miles in the two days. My foot hurt like crazy this morning but settled down this afternoon. I am not sure what is up with that ankle. The 5 extra miles will not show in our totals as they are not AT miles. Bob and I have the hostel to ourselves tonight.

We are currently hanging from the corners of a very large Pavillion at the edge of Port Clinton, PA. Bob and I doubled up on one corner. Every other corner is also taken by a hammock. The pavilion is about 84x36. There is a privy we can use across the street and down a little. This is important information. We picked up a refill of water as we were walking through town from a spigot labeled ""hikers welcome.""We did the trail from 183 to Port Clinton in two parts. The first part we did after church on Sunday slack packing ( caring only snacks and water). The second part we did today. Yesterday was a beautiful for the most part and if today had been the same and if I had the same energy we might have made it to the campsite on the other side of town, but it was not and I had not.   I never had energy today and trail was rough. The miles listed for today are really split between Yesterday and today. Between yesterday and today some of the people we met were:Tribe, Goldie, Warrior, Rabbit, Lightning, Popeye and Olive Oil, Gilligan and Maryanne, Faceplant (yes, he did), Draggin, Melted Soul. There were many more but who can keep track.Yesterday it hailed beebee sized hail on us for 10 minutes then the sun came out. Today it was very hard to find a good place to rest. We kept our eyes open for the right place but much like a familiar fairy tale; that log was too short (I would bender be able to get up off of it), that rock is too high ( to hard to get on), that log /rock is just right ( tall enough that I can stand up when we are ready to go, yet short enough that I can sit comfortably and still take care of toe issues.

He had enough instruments to have a jazz band playing and sometimes he does. Bob went ahead and got his hair cut but left his beard soft for my sake. We finally headed out of Port Clinton at 10:45. We were going only to the first shelter but for us that was enough. We had a long steep climb out of the village then down up down up down through plenty of rock fields and one large boulder field. I developed a large, very large blister on my heel. I stopped to treat it several times and even resorted to a needle which I never do normally. I am not sure it helped as the blister refilled faster than anything would come out. On the same foot I have an ingrown toenail on the big toe also has a blister on the outside and on the tip.

Today's trail ended with a gradual downhill through a very lovely glade. I could do this section again with pleasure but not this year. Bob saw a large black snake sunning in the rocks (see photo) as we were headed back down from the pinnacle. It is a blessing he didn't step on it. He took pictures for our grandson who loved the last snake pictures. Another awesome thing was the group of observatories near the pulpit. There were three observatories and another building that held a library. The property way up on this mountain was perfectly manicured and owned by an an amateur astronomy club. Trained members had free access to the telescopes and the library. There was no room at the shelter tonight but camping allowed across the street from the shelter.

This time a take off from a Johnny Cash song ""just like a snail. I walk the trail "" We had been forewarned that it was going to be a rough trail all the way to the next shelter and they were correct.   If it was not a boulder field it was a very sharp rocky trail, hard on the feet. The areas we went through were beautiful, however, whenever we were able to look up from foot placement to see. Bob saw a deer first thing and when we got to DAN's Pulpit the view was so spectacular and the weather so fine, it was hard to leave, but we had four more miles to hike to the shelter so we eventually hiked on.   We passed by three groups of school kids. At the third sighting, the teacher was passing out snacks to the kids and asked what they wanted.   I piped up, "" I want a tall ice cold gatorade.""She stopped us and ask if we would mind telling the kids about thru-hiking.   We told them about ""leave no trace ethics"" on the trail and trail magic ( to explain my gatorade comment) and trail angels, and flip -flopping.   Their teacher handed is a small bag of smore Gorp then and we told the kids (teens) that the teacher had become a trail angel and had given us trail magic.

We heard there was a restaurant at 309 and the AT, only four miles ahead. We ate a couple of granola bars to satisfy the need for something in our stomach with morning meds and then set off, dreaming of eggs and bacon and hashbrowns. The trail was mostly an old forest road so it was fairly easy going for Pennsylvania. We arrived at Blue Mountain B&B before 10. Unfortunately it didn't open until noon. He did sell us a couple of fountain drinks and allowed us to sit on his porch to eat our breakfast, more granola bars this time with peanut butter on them. Leaving there we began to see Rocksylvania again but really not too bad. Bob's great eyes spotted a female turkey. Our noise made her duck down and then when we came closer she ran away but not far. We think maybe she had a nest there. Even later we startled a very large black snake beside the trail.   As he slithered away he shook his tail in the dry leaves.   It sounded like a rattler.Them suddenly a boulder field that went on forever arrived and worse the   blazes led us up to a sharp ridge of boulders that we were to somehow balance on and walk along the top. This ""fun"" area is called the knifes edge and that is an apt title. It was very dangerous, precarious, and frightening. If I am redundant so was it.We finally crossed it safely and after another half mile of boulders we stopped to rest. I had to lie down to calm my heart. It was at this point we met Tink. She also almost had a heart attack getting across the knifes edge. She stopped at our resting spot to see if we knew If there was more of the same. We could not reassure her.We had a rocky but nice trail for awhile again until about a mile and a half short of the shelter we were looking for. At that time another large boulder field presented itself, climbing up to Bake Oven Knob, a popular day hike and there were many groups up there. You could look off on any number of spots to get a view of one side or the other of the mountain, beautiful. But the thru-hiker continues on to the other side of the Knob to another much more precarious section of Boulder hiking, again very dangerous and ridiculous. I am certain that Grandma Gatewood didn't hike either of these areas. I was sure that Tink was not happy with this part of the trail either.The trail finally calmed down and we hiked the last half mile in peace.Tonight we used our new mats and are bedded down in the shelter, with no good trees to hammock.","Allentown Shelter

Bob was able to get a picture. It was amazing. They chomped all night long. Many shelters have grates up all along the porches to prevent porcupine damage. This one did not. The hiking did not fail to include several long boulder field crossings but was tame compared to the day before and had many pleasant trail areas and a even few areas without major sharp rock obstacles to navigate. We ran into a group of scouts on an overnight who asked us some questions about thru -hiking. It is always fun to talk to young people. I would like to add that Pennsylvania scouts really hike!Upcoming hikers, don't stay at Mooneys Motel. Promises to get you back and forth to Palmerton as needed will not be kept. There is spotty WiFi. The shower has no tub so your plans to soak your sore muscles are not workable. There is only one trash can and it is tiny so soaking the foot in Epsom salts, while possible is not exactly relaxing.I called three churches after googleing ""churches in Lehighton."". I left a message that we were a through hiking couple looking for a ride to and from church.   One church was small enough that the number was really the pastors home phone. His wife said she would have him call us. Another pastor who checks his voice messages on Saturday amazingly called us first and offered us the ride.   We will be going to church tomorrow.After trying all shuttles listed with no hope of getting to a restaurant or resupply, the son of the owner of this place finally took us into Palmerton. We didn't know how we would get back but had downloaded the Uber app with hopes there. Our ride said, ""I'm sure you won't have trouble finding a ride back. Just ask around.""Really.?...! URG. We took one backpack with us with our dirty laundry inside. We ate at Berts Family restaurant (breakfast for our lunch - supper). We were hungry for eggs. We kept the laundry going next door at the Laundromat while we ate. There was a sign on the Laundromat door that said "" Hikers Welcome. Shirts and shoes required per PA state law. "". We had been told at the flip flop festival that hikers had lost their welcome in some towns due to doing all their laundry in the village Laundromat while basically naked ( maybe in a rain tarp). If you don't have town clothes, what do you do?We carry the extra weight. After eating we walked down a couple of blocks to the pharmacy and the town grocery. We bought a head of lettuce to have sometime tomorrow and a small bottle of ranch.   We will have lettuce wedges on our day off. We were asked if we were bothered by the fact that everyone passes us by. We are not. We love meeting them as they pass. We know our limitations and are hiking our own hike. Everyone is friendly and encouraging. We are impressed with ourselves despite our speed and while we do want to challenge ourselves, we are not interested in killing ourselves just for more miles unless that means the prospect of a meal and shower at the end of the day.   We love keeping in touch with those we meet via the notes they leave in the shelter logs or their online journals. We alway particularly look for Zip-tie's logs which we can count on for a laugh or smile. She has also been a wonderful help to us via text.   A few days back she sent us an invitation to a party with cake in Delaware Water Gap celebrating the end of Pennsylvania. We love that!

Who knows what he will charge for this room with three full beds. The day really began however with worship at Lehighton Bible Church. We were happily surprised that in addition to the three -four hymns we expected they also had a choir presentation and a chorus time using a small pamphlet of choruses. One chorus we sang was copyrighted in 1938 and another in 1958. They used the King James version Bible and did a responsive reading from the old testiment. They are slowly working their way through the Bible. The preaching was from a series the pastor was doing on law vs grace. We enjoyed it very much.

They started the hostel as a response to the scripture regarding the ""good"" Samaratin. It is a great hostel run by hiker donation and church member graces. The service was nice. It was laity Sunday. I especially enjoyed the anthem. With only two male voices and 8 females, they still managed to have the another's harmony parts sound balanced. It was really extraordinarily beautiful. I miss the quality music of prepared anthems so it was a treat.1297.8Bob again allowed me to slack pack the town and bridge. It was a good way to get my feet to walking again. Then up we went through Kittatinny Point Visitors Center. Right off we were told that we would soon see a mama black bear and get three cubs. Someone else said two. Before we saw her we were stopped by ""Digger"" running up the mountain to give us our stove. We had left it accidentally at the hostel. I am blown away that he brought it to us, running, in 90 degree heat. Unbelievable! We could not thank him enough.Right around the corner we saw the crowd with cameras up to take pictures of the bear just across the creek and up the hill from the trail. Bob tried to get a good picture. We watched for a few minutes as the bear slowly ambled up the mountain further and further away. We did not see the cubs.Later we had the second trail magic of the day. Two hikers coming down had fresh fruit they were giving out to AT through hikers. I received a handful of the sweetest blue berries ever and an apple. Bob received two apples. They were happy, snappy, juicy apples,if you know what I mean.We were also told of a place further up on the trail that was a memorial and prayer place full of cairns, each rock representing a prayer. They suggested we put a rock on a Cairn for our granddaughter when they found out why my head was shaved. When we arrived at the spot (see picture) the lady leaving suggested we put a rock and make a wish. We put a rock and said a prayer. Later up the trail a baby copperhead zoomed across the trail. Once again it was I who almost stepped on the little guy.We continued on up the trail to ""Backpackers Campground"" which was practically full of campers, many of whom were boyscouts. Bob is snoring.

It was longer than I imagined and much rockier than I expected. It was full of the sharp edged medium sized rocks whose sole purpose seems to be to turn ones ankles. It was on this trail that we met the first little orange salamander that I have read so much about in trail journals. After this was a good deal of smooth trail as had been promised but it was NOT smooth even a quarter of the trail. There were Pennsylvania style boulder hops from time to time (though not nearly as long) and one place where we practically had to scale a 20 ft rock wall. I should have practiced for this sort of thing at REI's climbing wall. I dreaded this when I saw it in front of us but it turned out to be kind of fun. At about the half way point we took an hour off in the shade by a stream. We ate lunch and soaked our feet in the hottest part of the day. I texted my dil asking her to send our summer bags which will lighten the load and to send my next size down hiking pants. These pants are getting hard to keep up.The long day really beat up my feet and Bob's back and feet. A nice man named Veggie walked back up from the shelter and took my pack the last 3 tenths of a mile. It was very nice but later he was very discouraging about my finishing the hike which I did not appreciate. I do need to lower the weight somehow.

The fact that some friends we met on the trail, Looney and Slug, were going into Port Jervis and staying at a quaint hotel with an acclaimed restaurant was also an encouragement as we hoped we'd be able to share shuttle costs.

I just couldn't make it happen.   Our first view was of beautiful Island Pond. Island Pond appears to be a favorite location. For local swimmers and campers but there was no one there that day and amazingly no trash.We had several climbs over or through the rocks including going through the Lemon Squeeze that many talk about ( see photos). A large group of hikers passed us galloping over a climb we found difficult like they were young billy goats.We were so void of energy that we talked about shortening our day by 4 moles and calling for a ride where the trail crossed Seven Lakes Road instead of Palisades Parkway. We had gone through the Lemon Squeeze and I was not impressed except that the trail took us through something instead of up and over it. I told Bob that I really needed the Lord to give me some energy because I was unable to pull it up for myself. I then thought and said that seeing wildlife gives me energy. Right after that we saw a fat gray squirrel run up a tree, a garter or ribbon snake on the trail, a chipmunk ran across the trail not one foot in front of me, then maybe 20-30 feet in front of me a young buck slowly walked across the trail eating leaves from the forest floor as he ambled along. We stayed completely still and watched him for awhile. Every once in a while he gave a glance our way but was apparently not concerned about our presence. Bob was able to take several photos. When we arrived at Seven Lakes Drive I honestly still felt like I just had no energy but at the same time felt like we should press on.Shortly after this as we began the climb up the foothill of Black Mountain, Bob found a phone. He has such sharp eyes. Fortunately the person owning the phone had her number listed as ""me"" and also had a couple of trail names listed that we recognized as part of a large group of young people hiking together. We texted a couple of them saying we had her phone. She hadn't yet realized it was missing. They texted back that they were at the next shelter, which was the William Brian Memorial Shelter on the south side of The Black Mountain. Is it crazy for me to say that the Lord wanted her to know he loved her enough to keep a couple of old tired geezer going despite their energy levels so they could return her phone?Black Mountain was a good climb and a view of New York City in the far distance. We could see it with our eyes. Can you see it in this picture? We ended the day at Palisades Parkway and walked up to the visitor center that lies in the middle of the median for easier pick up.

We started on the South side of Palisades Parkway which meant crossing both sides of this four lane highway, my least favorite task. Today my Achilles heel was acting up. It is always something. Places where we could have really made time were hiked as slowly as the climbs. We had asked for and received an early start time hoping that by some miracle we could make it before noon to a pick up location with enough time to make it to the Ft Montgomery post office. We had a supply box coming there that was to include summer bags ( liners really) and a smaller size pair of pants for me. We really had two mountains to climb. West Mountain then Bear Mountain. Neither would have been particularly difficult now that we have more strength in our legs and a better wind except for my Achilles heel which made every step painful. With the heavier pack Bob's back started hurting again as well. Still the views were astounding. Also when we looked at Bear Mountain's tower from West Mountain we could not believe we would be down West and up to that tower in a few hours of hiking but we were. We climbed the tower and learned the history of that area.   It was impressive. The generosity and foresight and man hours it took to build a beautiful area for people to get out into nature. We were picked up at Bear Mountain Inn by John's friend who took us home where we met with his beautiful wife and four adorable children.

That was where the bear came by my tent at 1 am.""I am so thankful I did not have this information last night. I would not have slept well. Today's hike was really wonderful. There were a lot of areas of fairly smooth trail and a very long section along the side of the Mountain that was lined with rock including the bridge/ dam/ horse trail pictured here. I am very curious about the history of this section. There were also some stone fences we passed through which were very curious in the middle of the forest. One was maybe 100 yards long and amazingly 3 feet wide. There was also one serious rock wall climb. It was one of those where my mind said ""no, way; no way,"" while my determination said, ""you can, you will."" Then there was too much trail that was full of rocks where the mind had to stay focused on foot placement. Just before the shelter there was a short area of boardwalk and a nice bridge across a stream. We crossed other streams today that required stone hopping including one that we soaked our feet in. In short a little of everything today. We saw three ribbon or garter snakes today. All but one was too fast for a photo. Then when we were resting for our lunch (in the shade between 2 and 3), we heard the movement of feet just across the hill we were facing and waited as still and quiet as we could so we could see them cross the trail. We saw one and she saw us. She stood still watching us while we also stood still. She tapped one of her front hooves one time them slowly turned and walked the other way still checking us out every few steps. The other deer must have gotten the message to go the other way. I really did well most of the day. I pushed myself for 30 minutes before our lunch break and it did not fare well for my foot. Those who are praying, thanks. For more specific prayer it is not really my ankle so much as the tendon between my ankle bone and my heel. Changing to ibuprophen has helped some.

A beautiful walk that included almost every type of moderate trail including boardwalks, pastures crossings with stiles, bridges, moderate rock climbing, and beautiful forest trails. It was also a trail magic day, twice. First Trail Magic was when we arrived at the Nature Garden Center. Here they allow hikers to fill their water bottles, charge their phones, take an outside free shower or an inside warm shower for $5. They also have some limited hiker supplies for sale. I was looking at a display and the sales lady, Pam, asked me if I was okay. I don't know why but all of a sudden I fell apart. You would think I was a teen during her time of month. All of my confused feelings, my weariness, my heartaches, my physical pain, my worries about Bob in all this, my worries about my daughter, my missing my family as they all were getting ready to gather, my desires and fears regarding the trail swirled around my throat and chest and leaked from my eyes. I remember telling my prayer partner before I left that I wanted to be known on the trail as the woman who prays. The Lord has humbled me to rather be the one who stands in need of prayer, then provides an angel (Pam) to pray with me. We took advantage of the inside showers which really made me feel like a new woman. I was so dirty. A bit rough putting dirty clothes back on but despite that, it was delicious. If you have never been hiking day every day for a number of days without a shower, you can't imagine the relief. The prayers and caring heart of a sister in Christ was amazingly refreshing.Second trail magic was when we were almost to the shelter but running out of water and the ""streams"" were nearly dry. A man, Iceman , sees Bob trying to dip out some water to filter, and tells him he had water in his car on the road a little further up on the trail. Bob thanks him and tells him he is one of The Wanna Bs. Iceman's face lights up. Turns out he is following us on our journal and is the gentleman who offered to slack pack us back in Pennsylvania if only I had the sense to check my email or guest book regularly back then. He gave Bob cookies and a Dr Pepper and water and let him sit on a chair to rest then went back up the trail to help me out with my pack. I thanked him but foolishly refused as I knew I was almost there.   When I saw Bob sitting in a chair having a good old time I was quite surprised. There was root beer for me and a chocolate chip cookie. So refreshing! We sat for awhile then Iceman carried my pack up the quarter of a mile to the shelter for me. I could have and maybe should have done it but he was so kind to offer.","Telephone Pole Shelter

The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538923,"1463.5Schaghticoke Mtn. CampsiteWe had second day of amazing trail magic of various kinds. The day started out with us thinking we were just going to do the four miles between Wiley Shelter and Ten Mile Shelter, leaving 8.3 for Monday. After we started and Bob started singing a hymn, I realized that we might have taken Iceman up on his offer to shuttle us if we had thought to ask him to shuttle us to a church service. This didn't happen. At the first road we came to after Wiley Shelter there was trail magic in the form of bottled water, and some bananas. We really enjoyed those bananas.Just a little farther on the trail we found another cache of trail magic. This time it was all sorts of hostess treats and bags of chips plus an ice chest full of sodas. We each had a soda. I chose root beer. We each had a small bag of chips. We also took a honeybun each for tomorrow's breakfast. This was wonderful magic. It was done by Crock N Roll's parents. There was enough for more hikers than would possibly come by, 20-30. Very generous.Layer down the trail ""Crock N Roll"" passed us( though we didn't know it was him at the time). He told us there would be more magic at Schaghticoke Rd. Later two more GA hikers went by and told us that ""Crock N Roll's parents would be having more trail magic for hikers at Schaghticoke Rd. We asked how they knew this and identified Crock N Roll for us and mentioned BBQ. We studied our map and guide and decided we could make it to the Schaghticoke Camp Ground, a goal we had not considered before. We met lots of great people who were day hiking near the Housatonic River.    They were interested in hearing about our hike and talked of wanting to do the same someday. The AT runs alongside or within view of the shore of that river for quite awhile. It was beautiful and noisey with water rushing over rocks. I loved it! Bob took a picture for me. We crossed that river on a high bridge. One of the people we talked to was named Walter. He wanted to take our picture and we let him. He wanted our journal information and Bob wrote it down for him. He told Bob he wanted to treat us to lunch and gave him money and directions to a nearby restaurant just down the trail. Bob tried to refuse but in the end accepted. That turned out to be our Father's Day lunch magic. Another man, trail name I knew I would remember gave Bob a cold coke from his pack and told us where an ice chest of cokes and beer was waiting for through hikers. I took a water from it when we got there. Another man told us about his thru-hike in 2005. He said his name was ""Brother BUZZ"". He said his son did it with him and his trail name was Lightning.   Later after we ate at the Bull's Bridge Inn, a CT-ATC volunteer offered to give us a ride to a road close to the next shelter. I didn't want to miss the trail before that road so we refused. The trail was difficult mostly just because it was climb,climb, climb but there were a couple of rocky ledge areas that were a bit of a challenge, though nothing like much of what we have done before without a problem. BUT today it was a problem. Maybe it was because the difficult part was after we ate too much lunch. Maybe it was because we were tired and concerned about making it to camp before dark. Anyway at one spot Bob's foot was caught a second too long in a crevice on the way down a rocky face. If he had fallen it would have meant a face plant on the rocky descent. It was quite a scare. Not 10 minutes later I had a similar scare and near fall. Tonight we sleep safe and blessed in our hammocks on the top of a hill. The moon is very bright. Tomorrow we have a 3 mile trail rather than an 8.3 trail. The descent down to Kent, CT was reported to us to be the steepest and most difficult yet for us flip -flop hikers so we are a bit concerned. We continue to hope for a couple of recovery days off.","Wiley Shelter, NY

The Wanna B's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538925,1466.7Today we hiked just from the Schaghticoke Mtn. Campsite to the road. It was a rocky steep descent. We were picked up at the trailhead by a shuttle and taken to his hostel but he took us by a hot dog stand on the way. We have been yearning for hot dogs since the first time we heard there would he a hot dog stand at the crossing and there wasn't...a couple of weeks ago. Ready to ice the foot and try to get it to heal. The hostel is beautiful and he did it himself.,"Schaghticoke Mtn. Campsite

Despite this, by the time we finished the 7.4 miles, we begged for a ride into town. My ankle tendons were done for the day.   My hip was aching from the extra weight of the shoe plus the brace. Worst of all my right knee complained loudly of the extra work required of it. The pain in that knee going downhill was excruciating and it was not a serious hill. Meanwhile, Bob was starting to have serious pain issues. I give up!   Seriously sad but resigned. 
The waterfall we saw near the end of today's hike was beautiful and a positive note on which to end this adventure.","Marie's Hostel
