Scarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517927,"Why hike 2190 miles?I had sleep apnea. I had gained weight, was tired and cranky and really miserable. Once I got treatment I felt so much better I wanted something really big. I mean something really big to do; to make a break from the past.I always enjoyed day hiking but never camped overnight. I always enjoyed meticulous, detailed, intricate hobbies and ultra-lite hiking appealed to me. My father blazed a trail for me with hobbies he took on in my childhood and he was always 'all in'. Things like organic gardening, beekeeping, racing pigeons, running a marithon, to name but a few. I wanted something big, I wanted it to be physical and multi-dimensional, ie. the preparation was going to be as much a motivator as actually doing it, and doing it had to be challenging, physically and mentally.The picture is of my dog Foosa. In this pose she exemplifies motivation; ready to pounce!",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Fri",0
Scarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519811,"After being motivated, I needed to prepare, so I lost 50 pounds. I studied and tweaked gear for 3 years. The first year I had a horrible 4 day hike in Massachussets on the AT. Could barely sleep. The second year I did a 10 day hike from the Hudson River to the Mass Pike on the AT and the third year I did a 135 mile 7 day hike through most of Vermont on the AT. Along the way, I started allergy shots for tree, grass and weed pollen, mold, dust mites, and dog and cat fur. Yup, 4 shots at a time, and if you don't think dog, cat, mold and dust mite shots are important, think about cheap motels and hostels. Planned on getting a battery setup for my CPAP machine but wound up not needing it due to the weight loss. Discovered I was allergic to bees and other 'vespids' and needed a plan for that. Dealt with plantar fasciitis and other foot issues and wound up with custom orthotics. Worked the summer base pack weight down below 10 pounds. Paniced and added a few things back in like camp shoes, then whittled back down below 10 pounds again. Kept on loosing ear plugs so got custom fitted ones for sleeping (yes that's a thing). Got plantar fasciitis back and discovered the 'Strassburg sock' (look it up). Revisited my not quite forgotten penchant for panic attacks, now brought on by sleeping alone in the woods and fear of heights. Behavior modification techniques from my past got me past that, and googling AT fear of heights gave me some day hikes in the Whites to challenge me. Had to work out a plan with my worried wife. Took a wilderness first aid course and now carry a spot messenger. 
I could go on. Point is I think I am ready!",,View Entry,"Jan 02, Sat",0

I love telling people I'm going on the Midnight Train to Georgia. I googled it and any train travelling past midnight is fair game to be a midnight train.I'm busy planning my very few packages. I want to 'live off the land' as much as possible but a few places are just easier with a package, like Fontana.I keep picking through my gear. I have made a few last minute choices. I will take a few extra things, like a battery to rechange my phone and then when I hopefully don't need it will mail it back. I figure about a pound of extra gear won't kill me and will definately make me stop second guessing. Then anything I don't use it I'll feel good about sending it back.",,View Entry,"Jan 03, Sun",0

He has been packed and loaded onto his ""midnight train to Georgia"" with all his wares in tow, to be delivered to kind friends ( thank you, Rod!) who will see him to the trail. But this is not the start of the journey. No, it's been a few years now of meticoulos planning, purchasing, (and talking), weighing, replanning, (and talking), training and more training. Oh, and did I mention the endless trail talk, laser focused, single threaded, amazing how any topic can become a trail topic, to anyone in range, talking?   Just kidding, my love! We heard every word!    But it is done now! It's time for the next phase of the journey. There are no more widgets to order and weigh only to be replaced by another widget, weighing half an ounce less. You have trained hard and tirelessly on Monadknock and ""The Whites"" , and circled the Blue Hill's 18 miles of trails, and circled, and circled and circled....and circled.   It's time now to take a different, but not so straight path. The trail head is almost at your feet and YOU ARE READY!

Continuing to work on my IT band. Easing up some. And Plantar Faciitis continues to slowly improve. About pace. I'm doing 16 mile days approximately. Except when getting to a Hostel or shopping. Sometimes if the Hostel is off trail in a town it takes some time to get back. There is plenty of light at the end of the day so when I feel like it the distance will increase. In the meantime the slope, elevation change and general rockiness of the trail is increasing as we approach the Smokies. So we are in a way getting faster and stronger by the day, it's just not showing up in the numbers. With tenting restrictions in the Smokies we will have to be carefull to get to a Shelter early enough for a spot. Many hikers are either slowing down, have very sore knees or dropping out and the advice of the Hostel owners is to use caution until after the Smokies. So that's what we will do. Below are links to the 15 and 18 mile per day plans. On average, on track with the 15 mile plan and likely will be between the 15 and 18 mile plans after we get through the smokies. http://theatguide.com/PlanNobo2010-15.htmlhttp://theatguide.com/PlanNobo2010-18.htmlMy knee is getting somewhat better.

Scarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530861,"Backlog of blogs from Scarfoot while in Smokies. Smokies Day 2: Talk to an apprentice ridge runner and a trail maintainer. Met Joules a 64-year-old German woman. Our pace is much faster than her, but she started April 13, so is kicking our asses. She has done the PCT and other trails after years of martial arts and kickboxing at a competitive level. She recommends tofu chicken bites for protein, got to get Minx to research that. Knee seized up again pretty bad this time. Doing more IT bands stretches multiple times per day. Watched two people spend two hours each trying to get a fire out of wet wood. Food bag still ridiculously heavy but finally able to get the cookpot inside in order to hang it at night. Smokies Day 3: Knee much better. Still hopscotching with Joules. Got trail magic at Newfound gap just as they were closing. They need a permit because it is a federal park and is only good for a couple of hours, bouroracy for you. Shelter is filling up due to some possible rain. Vern showed me the pigeon pose and told me to stretch my hammy's to also help with the IT band. It feels real good. Sundog keeps popping up, saw him first on Hawk Mountain and every other day or so since. Santa Claus event, a guy climbed on the roof, climbed down the chimney made out the bottom, full of soot and complaining his feet were hot because of the fire that had burnt there last night.Smokies Day 4: Stayed at tri-corner shelter last night Up by 7 AM a new record. Continuing IT band stretches. Got to see Charlie's bunion. Also, first day we were really really on the ridge between Tennessee and North Carolina, sloped off a couple thousand feet on each side on the 70 to 80° angle pass only a foot wide with maybe a couple of feet extra on each side before the drop, brushes and trees however kept us securely on top. Quick day, got to shelter by 12:30. By 3 o'clock the shelter was overcapacity and by 4:00 people were planning to sleep on the dirt floor. Faucet continues to inform me of pot smoking. He has a better nose. We agreed on Sisyphus as the code word. We finished the night with 17 people in a 12 capacity shelter and seven extra people on the floor. Right side velcro on sneaker to hold gator failed at 230 miles. Ate the ramen with Parappa's note. Thanks for your best wishesSmokies Day 5: End at Standing Bear Hostel. Are on 15 mile a day plan. Including elevation gain and elevation lost this day we lost 6700 feet which was 1.5 times larger than anything that came before 3100 feet up total 18 miles it was long my knees work or ready to give up. Target was standing bear hostile. Very interesting place, very laid-back but we got a good nights sleep and we got to resupply. Spam is awesome. Pizza is stupendous. A questionable scale showed a 20 pound loss for me when I leaned left and a 15 pound loss when I leaned right. I'll leave the political scholars to ferret out any meaning to that. The pair that left at 4 o'clock in the morning from last night shelter is still being talked about by other shelter mates. The scenery was just absolutely stupendous through the Smokies as you can see from the pictures, just amazing. Met Darkness today. Almost broke out into the song, called him my old friend. First day to Hot Springs stayed at roaring fork shelterFantastic day. The weather is perfect. I picked up my lost tent yesterday and sent the replacement tent back. Knee is not bothering me quite as badly and things are well with the world. Got to Max Patch today. It is amazing as you can see from the pictures. Just a grassy field with the most stupendous 360° view of the Appalachian Mountains you'll ever find anywhere. Faucet keeps on talking about bagels and lox and trying to hook us up with a bagel shop in Erwin. I told him I am holding out for prune hamantaschen, dammit. Met the Iowa couple who treated us to a campfire. Non thru hikers have the energy to do this. Look for their picture by the campfire. They are looking to buy a log cabin with outbuildings and possibly set up a Hostel. Sounds very much like the Minx and I. Day before Hot Springs. Day went really well. Yesterday's extended stretches seam to be paying off. 15 quick miles. Have to hold back since Hot Springs has a music festival and there are no rooms. Staying at a tiny shelter (only room for 5, barely), hoping to keep our tents dry and get an early start for breakfast. Tomorrow will be a nero, meaning an almost zero day, only 3 miles.

Meant for 5 but really old when people were smaller. Hardly any room and packs blocking the entrance. Lots of rain and always have to hang the packs to keep away from the mice. One guy got up early swearing at everyone that his camp shoes were disturbed at night. He complained bitterly about the other hikers smells and manors that were disturbing him. Everyone spoke about him for days. The hostel in Hot Springs was wonderful but did not have wifi and the 5 bar Verizon service won't allow any data. Town was great but the wifi at each restaurant and store would collectively go out for hours at a time. Found out the closed trail north of town due to the forest fire is now going to reopen tomorrow. Finally got a knee brace at the outfitters. Resupply only for one day. Hemlock Hollow Update:Hiked through the black burned areas. Stayed at a hostel called hemlock hollow. They bought it and were open for only 4 days before the fire. Resupply was horrific. No wifi and no phone at all. But the shower and private hut we got was fantastic. Flint Mountain Shelter UpdateHeavy rain but it finally cleared by noon mid afternoon. Has gotten quite cold. We had a very rocky ridge walk. Would have been fantastic except for the clouds and rain. Met Sundog at the hostel. He's going off trail for a couple of days in Ashville. He promised to catch up. He thinks our conversations are more interesting than the young potheads out here. Whistling Gap UpdateWas planning a long 18 mile day with big ups and downs. Found out that Bald Mountain shelter at 5100 feet was going to be 33 degrees overnight with snow so we pushed on another 3.5 to a tent site 1200 feet lower to avoid that mess. Our longest day so far by allot. The mountain was a bald and was stupendous. 360 views like Max Patch but even more layering in the distant mountain ridges. Staying in Uncle Johnny's Hostel tonight.

No data on Verizon and wifi overwhelmed. Got resupply with shuttle to Walmart and got a big cheap pasta dinner at an Italian joint. Uncle Johny himself drove the shuttle and confirmed it has been more than 10 degrees below normal the last couple of days and nights. We are concerned about 2 days from now when we are scheduled to hit the highest shelter at 6200 feet. Someone let the shelter dog into the bunk room. He sleeps mostly but would periodically noisily lick his genitals for long periods of time. Even could hear it through the earplugs. Day after staying at Cherry Gap ShelterThis should be the last cold night before the warm up. Quite cold during the day. Unaka mountain had allot of snow on it. The trail was very muddy and wet with the melting. Must have gotten multiple inches with the amount left by mid afternoon at 45 degrees. Tenting at shelter hoping for no rain but it is staring now after dinner. Spoke to a Swiss thru hiker named Cranberry. Very friendly. She is going at about half our pace right now. We are trying to speed up. With the warm up we are still not happy with the elevation of Roan High Knob Shelter so are going to try for a 24 mile day to Overmountain Shelter.

Took us a full 10.5 hours for the 25 miles. Very rough trail. Lots of rocks and roots and very steep in places. Was tired but no knee brace and no knee problems. Plantar fasciitis is noticed at the end of the day but is controllable through stretches. Saw the ponies and the long horned steers. Saw a poney and her 15 minute old baby. Just missed it according to the other hikers. Wished to see the first step but there were many misses and we moved on. The scenery was fantastic. Some of the ponies would almost walk right up to you. Very cold night into the mid 30's but at least we were off the 30 mph winds on the ridge and 1000 feet lower.

Herd 2 days later that ground water froze on that ridge that night. Day leaving the Greyson Highlands20 mile day again since the only other option was a 10 mile day. Very rocky. Found out that 65 miles in 3 days is a bit much. Definitely slowed down in the last 4 miles which has not happened for a few weeks.

Last drop off was 1.5 hours away but touring the backroads with the pups was inevitable making for long days. Had an exciting evening last weekend when a bear visited the cabins front porch at 10:30 at night. Naturally, I was here alone and couldn't take a picture and scare him off with my whistle at the same time. The whistle won so no picture but it was a sight I won't soon forget. A bear right outside the glass door is a bear way too close for comfort. Too bad Faucets wife and son had left earlier that day. I'm sure his son would have loved it.   I lined up chairs across the porch should the bear return, he is sure to make some noise and scare himself (or give me some warning) if he topples the chairs.

Bad day physiologically and physically. Panic and indecision over the forecast flooding high winds and torrential rains. Faucet with his bad knee and now a bad ankle. I broke a pole. Slowing me in hiking and potentially crippling my tent. We started the day having the backsplash from torrential rains coming in through the tent mesh. I used my rain jacket to protect my sleeping bag. I then figured out how to collapse the porch when the rain was bad and how to reserve tot to stop the condensation in the tent eleven the rain calmed down. Faucet managed to get his shoes and all socks not only wet but muddy from leaving them under his porch. At the end of the day we got soaked not quite having set up our tents. Faucet pitched his tent in the main flow to my puddle. Literally a 2-3 inch puddle I had pitched my tent in. Understand that this was not the case when we started. Moving tents is not a friendly act. About the pole. The Waynesboro outfitter was not usefull over the phone so we booked a B and B that will accept packages, called The Minx for a overnight shipment of my old poles. All while the thunder storm visibly approached and we still had a thousand feet to clear the mountain and several miles to get to the campsite.

Big 21 mile day. We have seen many mountain laurel and rhododendron blooms over the past week. The tend to bloom in large patches but not all on the same mountain at the same time.

Not a great thing when you carrying a pack all day. It can ware on you. He'll have to make due for a few days. Was able to contact Zpacks and they are shipping out a replacement for free.   Otherwise all seems good. From Scarfoot: Basically the attachment that holds the hip belt to the pack and distributes the weight broke. I took the top one out and used it on the bottom or I would not have been able to hike.

Got my new shoes just in time, there was a chunk missing in the bottom of the left one. Got my new pack. Moved over the accoutrements and mailed the old one back. Real good improvements. Zpacks is a top notch company. Went to the pub for dinner after careful consideration on resupply. Overall a great day but low miles.

Woke up to find a mouse hugging my backpack which is suspended from a cable under an upside down can. They really can jump. Passed the last two significant mountains but they are only 3000 footers. Night in Monson staying at ShawsResupplied heavy and I mean heavy. Ate two lunches and two dinners. For desert I had a Ruben. Tomorrow breakfast is all you can eat blueberry pancakes.

He was planning to stay at either the East Branch or Cooper Brook lean-to's.   I can see he has passed East Branch so I assume he is at Cooper Brook although his satellite signal must be getting blocked. No dots since 3:22pm. He called from the top of the last 3000 foot peak. All the rest of the trail will be lower elevation except for Katahdin itself.   Today is day 3 of the 100 mile wilderness.

He is at Abol Bridge campground tonight where there is no service but they let you use their satellite phone for one buck a minute. It was rapid fire information, I love you, goodbye. I think the trail has made him cheap..... I mean frugal. I shouldn't complain. It was a clear signal and I could hear every word, which hasn't happened since seeing him in person in NH. He'll be up very early tomorrow to secure his campsite in Baxter Park at the Birches Lean-to for tomorrow night. There are limited options for staying in the park overnight and only the first 12 people in line, get a spot for the night. There is no random tenting in the park and the few campgrounds in the park are reserved well in advance. He'll have a short 10 mile day Friday and be nice and rested for his final climb on Saturday.

I expect the next blog will be from Scarfoot after he summits Katahdin tomorrow and hitches back to the AT lodge in Millinocket. So, this is likely my last blog...seems fitting, I end as I started on April 9th. Well, it is here. The day we have anticipated with mixed feelings of excitement and apprehension. The AT has posed all her challenges but none could deter him. He has concurred mountain after mountain; crossed rivers, valleys, forests and rock fields; scrambled up, over and under car sized boulders. He has persevered through physical injuries, psychological and logistical hurdles and experienced both the beauty and monotony of the trail, that most of us can only imagine.   Along the way family, friends and the community of the AT herself, has encouraged, uplifted and forged new friendships. But it is almost done now! Katahdin literally is at your feet and victory but a few steps away.

Scarfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547027,"Well this is it. No summit photo. No finish. One hell of a time. The trail becomes very technical with big boulders above tree line. Very dangerous and not what I signed up for. One more mile of very nasty trail remained then the 'tablelands'. In the meantime it follows a ridge with shear drops behind and both sides in places. I could do it physically but would have hated every moment of it. I got what I wanted out of this. I was in it for the hike and that last 2.3 miles was mountain climbing to me not hiking. At the hostel met a woman who broke 4 ribs yesterday on Baxter. Seams I made the right choice at least for me. Signing off,Scarfoot","Birches Lean-to, Baxter State Park
