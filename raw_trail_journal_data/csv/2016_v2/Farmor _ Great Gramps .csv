We will use the first three required entries to tell a little about ourselves. Farmor is the Swedish name for Grandmother...specifically, Father's mother.I am mother to three wonderful sons and grandmother to two adorable grandsons. My oldest son -trail name ""Hans"" will be joining us for the first ten days. It will be very reassuring to have extra support in the beginning (as in ""I have fallen and can't get up"") especially since we will be some of the oldest hikers attempting a thru hike this year.",,Entry #1,"Feb 02, Tue",0
Farmor & Great Gramps ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520625,"I'm 68, have 4 grandchildren and and a great granddaughter, hence the name Great Gramps. I bitch about the ills of our society and look forward to escaping from constantly hearing the ""news."" In many ways, I view being on the trail as a retreat from the insanity and will enjoy the solitude (mostly).",,Entry #2,"Feb 02, Tue",0
Farmor & Great Gramps ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520627,"Great Gramps has been retired for about six years now and I just recently retired about two weeks ago. We are in the process of moving out of the house we are currently renting, organizing and moving all of our worldly possessions into storage. Since we have already given notice to vacate, there is no turning back now! We are also trying to prepare our meals and are planning mail drops about every two weeks. Nutrition will be very important to us and we know that we will not survive on pop tarts and ramen noodles. So much to do!",,Entry #3,"Feb 02, Tue",0

Farmor & Great Gramps ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522665,"Neither of us thought that the process of moving out of the rental house (that we dearly loved) would be so difficult...physically as well as mentally. So much sorting, discarding, recycling and reorganizing to get everything to storage lockers...yes, there are now three! It was physically demanding as we did most of the lifting ourselves with movers coming only to do the heavy furniture. Never, ever again! Phase 1 has ended.We have had four days to set up our resupply boxes at my son's house and they will be so happy to see us and our clutter gone tomorrow. Thinking through all the wants and needs and packing up light and nutritious meals has been a challenge but I think we are close to being done.

Farmor & Great Gramps ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523710,"We have rented a car and are leaving for Atlanta in the morning. We are both very tired of trying to anticipate all the issues we will face and be prepared for them as that is impossible to do. Let it begin already! We are both a little concerned about our inability to walk and train with our packs these last two months since packing, moving and setting up the resupplies proved to be a tremendous amount of work! More than we anticipated. We both realize that our packs are heavier than we would like but we will go very slow the first few days and hopefully it will all come together!",,soon!,"Mar 16, Wed",0
Farmor & Great Gramps ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524349,"Today was the day! We were picked up at the Holiday Inn at 8am by Ron Brown who provides a shuttle service to the trailhead at Springer mountain. He was fantastic and gave us advice and information regarding the first section of the trail. He is also a trail Angel who helps all hikers when he sees the need, not just to his customers. What a great guy!We started up the trail to Springer mountain to sign the register and take pictures. It was a cold day and the path was muddy and rocky but we made it without incident. Our packs are heavier than we wanted and our bodies felt it immediately. Most of the excess weight was food but that will change as we eat our way up the trail. After the decent from Springer, we continued north. Most people stay at Hawk Shelter the first night which is about 8 miles but we soon realized we would never make it that far! I think we made it about 5 miles and then found a flat camping area that we limped into. As we were putting up our tent, it started to snow and then hail! It is very cold and when the frozen rain stopped falling, we built a small fire and started to cook dinner. First support was spaghetti. When the hale started again, supper was only half done so we had to move everything to the vestibule of the tent finish cooking.We are now tucked into our beds at 7pm. It is so cold we have our jackets on inside our sleeping bags to keep warm. In addition, we have the water bottles tucked in also so they don't freeze. It was a an interesting first day.Most important thing I learned about today was ""snot rockets"". I hope I get better at it!""Take your time and you'll be fine."" Ron Brown.","Springer Mountain

We cooked a hot breakfast hoping that would warm us up a little. The temp only got up to the high 30's (according! to another hiker). Too cold!We did slightly better today but we have to go slow. Packs are just too heavy so we are going to have to adjust our resupply plan a little and send half the food up the trail so we are not carrying so much. It will work out.I have found that cooking in the vestibule works out great so long as I remember to fold back the tyvek...It is just a little hole! Don't have to worry about wind, rain or snow and we keep it ventilated and it helps to warm the tent.""Hans"" has been a great help and I know we are probably driving him crazy by going so slow but that is all we can do right now. He had made these beginning days so much easier!Every body part aches a little but no real injuries. Hopefully we will get stronger every day!Great Gramps is asleep every night by 7:30.

Farmor & Great Gramps ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524494,"Camped last night on the mountain between Hightower Gap and Horse Gap. Set up our tents and cooked dinner of chicken and rice. Pretty good! Sunset behind the ridge line was beautiful and a nice way to end the day. The morning was still cold but the sun was up and it was a beautiful day. We started strong and finished weak...seems to be a pattern! We climbed both Sasafrass and Justin mountain today and were able to fill up our water containers at Justin creek. It was beautiful and a lot of people gathered to relax and even soak their feet. One more reason to filter your water! Turned out we were trail angels today. Got to the top of Sasafrass mountain and there was a woman hanging onto a tree, said she was feeling light headed and blacking out. She asked for help and luckily we had a phone connection and called 911. They transferred us three times before they could figure out where we were. We gave them the coordinates off of the gps and they said they would come and get her. She settled on a log by the trail and ""Hans"" gave her some energy snack and she seemed better. She insisted that we continue and she promised to stay put until the rescuers arrived. Feeling a little weird but knowing there was nothing else we could do for her, we continued. We checked with other hikers as they passed us and they all stopped to make sure she was ok. I hope she didn't have to wait too long and that she is safe tonight.We are at Gooch Gap shelter tonight, not much of a signal for phones. I will post all of our entries when we can get a connection. Lots of people here and we were lucky to get a decent spot and set up our tents side by side. All the bear lines were full so ""Hans"" through a Rock over a tree limb and was successful the first try. Impressive! We have two bear canisters and hopefully they will be untouched tonight.Thanks for all the support we are receiving, it really helps through this beginning time of adjustment.","top of hightower gap

Farmor & Great Gramps ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524614,"Last ones out of camp this morning and first ones to make camp tonight!It was a beautiful morning and after a breakfast of oatmeal and pancakes and the first cup of coffee in four days (thanks Ryden!) we started the first climb. I am sure it is easy for the younger folk but every joint creaked this morning and it was slow going. GreatGramps has good stamina and endurance but this fat old lady is slow! The weight of the pack is better but I am having trouble getting it cinched without cutting off the circulation to my colon and I get nauseated soon into the hike. Kept readjusting the belt and finally got it fairly comfortable and the rest of the day went better. Unfortunately the climb did not! Met our first trail angels and Great Gramps finally got the beer he was wishing for, while Hans and I had cold water. Missed out on the doughnuts cause we were too late but that is fine.Met our second trail angels at Woody Gap this afternoon and they were truly a blessing! These ladies had been here for three days feeding all who came through, they served 70 people yesterday! I felt so much better after I had something to eat and Gramps got a special cookie that they gave out to veterans only! I was so impressed and grateful to these women and I too will do the same for hikers on the PCT. My new goal in life!We decided to stay at Woody Gap and set up early and rest as there may be thunderstorms tomorrow! We may need every ounce of energy we have.","gooch gap shelter

Farmor & Great Gramps ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524868,"Off to a great start today, combed my hair for the first time in for days and managed to brush my teeth twice! Trail life is getting easier.Started hiking and we seemed to get into a better stride finally. We knew that the next few days would be tough with some difficult climbs ahead and we are still continuing to take things slowly although not necessarily by choice. Finding water had not been a problem so we don't need to add a lot of weight by carrying a lot at any one time. It was a beautiful day but as it progressed we knew there was a storm coming in and the hikers we met on the trail warned us. We made it as far as Woods Hole Shelter (which was full) and set up our tent in the campground in the cold and pouring rain. There was mud everywhere but mostly in the vestibule where we ended up doing our cooking. We got our tent up first (since it is integrated) and then helped hold the fly so Hans could get his tent up without getting the inside wet. He hiked down to the stream in the pouring rain to refill the water while I cooked his dinner first, then he dived into his tent and we didn't see him until morning. Great Gramps and I had supper and then climbed into our sleeping bags to stay warm. Gramps slept well but I had trouble as the wind howled in the trees and the rain splattered loudly on the tent. And in my mind's eye, I kept seeing the bears circling the tent waiting to get to the food that we kept in the tent as we didn't want to hang it in the rain. It was a long night.","woody gap

Farmor & Great Gramps ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524869,"We survived the night without any bear attacks but sadly not without rodents. Great Gramps left some sunflower seeds in the pocket of his Arcteryx jacket and this morning had a large hole that went right through the front. He now has duct tape sealing that up. In addition, the buckle broke on the waist band of his pack which made it more difficult to comfortably carry the load. But up to Blood Mountain we climbed and the views were spectacular! This is the highest point in Georgia and had a very cool stone shelter at the top. We can't decide which is harder, the climb or the descent. They are both painful!Tonight we are staying at the Blood Mountain Cabins were we showered, laundered our filthy wet and smelly clothes and washed the mud off all our gear.

Farmor & Great Gramps ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525071,"Left blood mountain cabin this morning feeling pretty good. We stopped in the resupply site and sent the bear canisters home. Good riddance! The AT continued through the Mountain Crossing building and went immediately uphill...like it seems to first thing every morning. After about a half hour we had to ditch the jackets to stay cool, not because it was warm but rather we warmed up on the climb. We went over Levelland Mt and then onto Cowrock Mt. Beautiful views despite the fog and mist coming in along with some intermittent sprinkles. Met lots of hikers today and enjoyed talking to them, everyone is so friendly. There was a long, slow, rocky descent into Tesnatee Gap but we were treated to beer and soda by two trail angels when we finally got down off the Mountain. I had reached my limit of endurance by then but there was no where else to go but up ... Up Wildcat Mt which was awfully steep and long and continued on forever! Bless Hans, he went up first and came back to meet me and take my pack! The upcoming shelter was over a mile off trail and there was no way I could do that. We found a small level grassy spot at the top of the ascent and immediately pitched our tents, thankfully no one else had done so. By now it had started to rain but we managed to get the tents up without getting too muddy this time so I guess we are getting a little better at this.

Decided it was pretty cool weather to hike in except for the thunderstorm when we reached the top of today's mountain. The trail was muddy and slippery so we had to be careful. Not too many people on the trail but there sure are a lot of hikers at the campsite tonight and nobody seems to mind standing out in the rain and chatting! Except us ole folk! There seems to be a leak in Great Gramps sleeping pad and this could turn out to be a major problem and will be a priority when we get to town. Unfortunately, that is still a couple days out as we are deep in the middle of the woods! The hiking has been a challenge albeit an enjoyable one but the rain and mud are taking a toll.

We all started separately this morning, as soon as one of us was ready, we just started walking to try and stay warm. The weather slowly cleared and it turned out to be a beautiful sunny day. We were very low on water in the late morning and we came upon a small run off stream that crossed the trail. We created a little dam and filtered a couple off liters to get us through the day. The Katadyn water pump is great...Turned a muddy little pool into crystal clear water! The hike was not too difficult today but very rocky. Great Gramps climbed away and I had to gingerly pick my way up over the rocks with Hans getting stuck with the chore of ""Farmor duty"" making sure I did not go over the side of the cliff! He and Gramps take turns protecting me!We stopped early today at Blue Mountain Shelter which had a lovely campground. We are already settled in for the night and Gramps had no trouble falling asleep while it is still light! It is going to be a cold one but no rain! Yay!","poplar gap

Lots of rocks going downhill and while it was not too bad, I took my first fall. Fortunately, it was not over the edge of a cliff and my head landed between a rock and a log so I was very fortunate. It is a reminder that one must pay attention all of the time! Gramps promised me a glass of wine tonight if I didn't fall again so that is my goal for today! Made it to Unicoi Gap and hitch hiked to Helen. Many thanks to trail angel Frank who believed it was safe to pick us up as we didn't look like terrorists!   He had a pickup truck and Hans and I were able to ride inside while Great Gramps and another hiker who came running when the truck stopped, rode in the truck bed. Helen is such a cool little town and we checked into the Best Western here and immediately showered and did laundry. Had a late lunch on the patio of Bidensee Restaurant -wonderful German food and Gramps now has a new beer- Erdinger Dunkle. This place is heaven. We will meet Carolynn here tomorrow and take our first zero day (no hiking). The old bones will be happy! Also going to get to an outdoor supply store and change out some equipment and rework our food resupply plan because what we are doing will not work in the future.

It may still be raining then but should clear up over the course of the day and then we should see a stretch of nice weather after that.We had to say goodby to our support team today which was difficult to do! I am not sure we are ready to be on our own yet and this a such a role reversal...The parents are the ones leaving home and will sink or swim! I miss you already Hans and really appreciate all that you did for us, I am not sure we would have made it this far without you! And Carolynn, thanks for your never-ending help and optimism, always showing us how tough and level headed you are, willing to go above and beyond to get us what we need.

Farmor & Great Gramps ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525947,"Woke to a light rain today but it soon ended and we were lucky to have missed any of the predicted showers for the area. Miss Janet (she runs a shuttle service for hikers) picked up 7 of us hikers from the Best Western in Helen and drove us all to Unicoi Gap to pick up the trail where we left off. It was pretty crowded in her van but every one was in a good mood and ready to get back on the trail and start hiking again. She took our picture in the camp parking lot and then we set off for Rocky Mountain, our first climb of the day which was about a thousand feet. This was followed by Tray Mountain which was another fifteen hundred feet and our most aggressive day so far. We were hoping to make it to Tray Shelter but were about a quarter of a mile short before we found a place to set up camp. Great Gramps was having trouble with his foot today and was feeling the effects of the climb. We had enough water to make dinner and to get us through the night but we will have to stop at the shelter in the morning to resupply or we won't make it through the day. There were lot of bugs today so I decided to use my bug spray. When I unzipped the pocket on my belt, everything that had been in that pocket was gone! At first I thought I might have left it unzipped and things just fell out but then I remembered a homeless man at Unicoi Gap who seemed very out of place and was hanging around my pack while we had our picture taken. He was also asking me questions about my tracker device and acting weird. I think he took what he could in that short time and the only thing of any real value that I will miss is my headlamp. Another lesson learned the hard way. I am using Hans's sleeping mat for a few days while we wait on a replacement of the damaged one. It is very comfortable and now both Great Gramps and I will get a good night sleep. It is cool but not nearly as cold as it has been so things are getting better.","Unicoi Gap

We packed up and hiked the rest of the way to Tray Mountain Shelter to resupply our water. Made coffee and oatmeal and we were off to a great start. It remained cool throughout the day and the wind gusted and howled through the trees non stop. We kept our jackets on hoping it would warm up but it never did. We felt like the hike was going pretty well until we got to Kelly's Knob and then it was agony, straight uphill all the way with no switchbacks or breaks along the way. As far as I am concerned, this was the worst climb we have encountered and I understand why people quit. We finally made it to Low Gap Shelter, got our tent set up and made dinner inside the vestibule so the tent would warm up a bit. Checked the weather forecast and there are freeze warnings for tonight with wind gusts up to 60mph. Yikes! I am keeping my phone, gps tracker, battery recharger, water ( to keep from freezing) and clothes in my sleeping bag with me. It could be a long night! Hopefully we won't blow away!","Tray gap

Beautiful view from the Vista which most hikers just flew by without taking the time to enjoy.We stopped to chat with some families and day hikers along the way which was very enjoyable.Got into Dick's Gap and got a ride from Ron Haven (well known friend to hikers) up to the Top of Georgia hostel where we needed to pick up our resupply food package for the next week. This is our first experience at a hostel and it is interesting. Great Gramps is in the top bunk and I am below him and there are six others in this room of bunk beds.

Surprisingly, it was pretty quiet without a lot of snoring or various other noises but it was hot. The mattresses had thick rubber covers and we used our sleeping bags on top and since it was a cold night, the windows were closed and a little heater was turned on in the corner. I roasted! There was no privacy with 7 men in the room so there was no way to strip down to cool off and I had a throbbing headache by morning. The youngsters were up by 6:30 packing up their stuff and going to breakfast and once again, Great Gramps and I were the last ones to get moving. We had a complimentary breakfast of coffee and a variety of muffins with honey butter and listened to a great pep talk by Sir-Packs-Alot, the owner off the hostel. We caught the shuttle back to Dick's Creek Gap and started our day. It was beautiful and warm and best of all, not too overly strenuous. There were ups and downs but they were all pretty gradual and there were switch backs. We hiked about 7 miles today and stopped at an unmarked campsite that had water for the night.

Every one was in really good spirits and we all felt like we were making progress. That was short lived cause Georgia has nothing on North Carolina in the way of mountains! The first climb was Couthouse Bald and it was straight up! There must have been a hundred steps up delineated by logs or rocks and it was a killer. Even the young kids were complaining! The views from the top were amazing! We stopped for the night at Muskrat Creek Shelter and have a beautiful spot down by the creek and it is so nice to have water so close by.

Most of the hikers that stayed in the shelter headed out very early this morning to try and get into a town and since they are young and can hike quickly, they stand a good chance of making it. We knew that we could not do that distance quickly so set our site on the next shelter which was 8.5 miles away. The trail was beautiful in the snow and we were warm as long as we kept moving. It hailed lightly most of the day and that was better than rain cause we could just brush it off but it made conditions treacherous and slow going in places. Albert mountain was very steep, rocky and muddy and the trail was literally on the side of a cliff and a long way down. We decided to bypass the lookout tower thinking it would be too dangerous in this weather. Good choice!

The more he talked, the more animated he became, waving his hands around rather than keeping them on the steering wheel and the less focused on driving he became. He almost hit one car but fortunately the other driver was able to avoid a collision. We were pretty shaken up by the time we got to our destination and were happy to finally escape into the woods.The weather was muggy but no rain today! It is always a little difficult to get back into the rhythm of hiking but we managed to trudge along most of the morning and early afternoon. We got to Silar Bald and decided to be content with a short first day back on the trail. We needed water so we followed the signs to the Shelter. That was a mistake! The blue blaze trail was so steep and so long...we finally just took off our packs and left them on the trail and brought the filter and containers the rest of the way to the little creek by the shelter. It literally took us about two hours to get back to our packs and the Bald where we set up camp and just collapsed on our pads for a while. Finally summoned up enough energy to cook supper, eat a few Oreos and bed down for the night. Great Gramps is very happy with his new sleeping pad and bag and passed out immediately.

We then headed back on the trail north to Wayah gap and mountain. It was such a steep climb the whole way and the only view was of the bare trees. The trail was so rocky, with smaller rocks that just cut into your shoes and make your feet ache. We heard lots of woodpeckers all day which was unusual and saw new little flowers that are beginning to bloom everywhere confirming the beginning of spring. There was trail magic at the top of Wayah Bald and an amazing stone fire tower. Again, the views were magnificent and we could actually see the summit at Silar Bald where we had started our day. We finished the day in the area of Wayah Shelter, set up our tent and cooked dinner. We eat in the tent with the pan set between our sleeping pads cause it is warmer inside. Some nights I take a few bites and then am so tired I lie down to chew. Great Gramps eats more than I do and I know we have both lost weight so it is important we try to take in more calories to keep our strength up. Unfortunately, food weighs a lot and it is hard to keep the weight of the packs down. Another incentive to eat and therefore lighten the load.","SILAR BALD

Great Gramps likes the uphill as do most other hikers but I hate it unless it is just a mild slope. There are no mild slopes on the AT! Downhill is easier for me mainly because of my hiking poles which I highly recommend. They are called Pacer Poles and I had to order them from the UK (thanks Ellen!) They are ergonomic and allow the user to lengthen the poles for the downhill thus putting your weight on the heels of your hands and not your knees when you steep down. Shorten the poles and they will take the burden when you need to step up. They have been so valuable and I don't think I could do this hike without them.We stopped at Cold Water Shelter for a snack and more water and then headed off thinking we would find a campground along the way as the afternoon wore on.

This morning most of the younger hikers got an early start as usual and we packed up most of our stuff and decided to have coffee and breakfast. I brought my whisperlite stove, water and two cups to the fire pit to heat (8:45) and this guy comes out of his tent demanding to know why I was cooking in his campsite! Really? He proceeded to smoke, cough, spit and stomp around but we just ignored him, finished packing our things and escaped to the woods.

What we cook and eat, what we need to drink, where we stay the night and the proximity of available water and how far off trail we will go to get it. Everything we do depends on water. The handle on our water filter broke again and we duck taped a rock to try and substitute for a handle, so far it is working pretty well.

Nothing on this trail is easy and when it does start to get really pleasant, there will suddenly appear some obstacle to overcome. We were almost at the top of the second climb, it was high 80s and I was running out of gas. Great Gramps was ahead of me still charging up the hill when a young male hiker came up behind me to pass. Panting, I asked him to please tell the man up the hill that his wife wants him to take a break. The young man looked confused and then said ""so sorry, I am Japanese and do not speak English"". My heart sank and if I had phone reception I would have called Lina and asked her to translate! But alas,I was doomed to hike on. I lived...barely.For the first time there was an obvious burst of spring everywhere! So many different flowers in bloom and trees with sudden green growth. At one point it felt like a magical forest and the only thing missing were the little fairies.

Farmor & Great Gramps ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529247,"Great Gramps here. Some random thoughts after a month on the trail. First, not that Georgia is easy, but North Carolina is tougher, much more so in my humble opinion. Both the ups and downs are steeper and longer. ""Jacobs Ladder"" is a true challenge. Regarding challenges, a major reason for me doing the trail is to confront the pure physical challenges faced every day. The only comparable physical challenge in my life was USMC Boot camp in 1968. Next, the trail always offers up a surprise to test your endurance both physical and mental. Rocks, boulders, roots, mud and the combination of all these often complicate what seems like an easy stretch. The trail demands focus and concentration. Relax for a moment and the danger of a slip or worse increases significantly. Trying to maintain focus through intense physical exertion is draining. I was fortunate to have had the ability to do some pre-trail training which had proved to be very beneficial. Unfortunately, Farmor didn't have the same opportunity for a variety of reasons. Watching her sheer determination to overcome the most difficult sections of the AT over the last week has been pure inspiration for me. Finally, making the descent into Fontana was magical. For the first time, green was the predominant colour of the forest. A multitude of flowers covered floor and the air was filled with a sweet fragrance. Appalachian spring!","FONTANA village

It was interesting how quiet it was for a Saturday being at a resort and on a lake but there was nobody around...except the bikers. Fontana Village is very close to an area called ""Tail of the Dragon"". There are 318 curves over eleven miles. Almost every guest was a motorcyclist and looking forward to a ride. We could hear the shifting of the engines long after we entered the woods.We crossed Fontana Dam and entered the Smokie Mountains, dropping our permits for backcountry hiking in the box. There were a fair amount of hikers on the trail today, both thru and day hikers. It was quite a climb (of course!) Up out of Fontana but not nearly as bad as the climb out of the NOC. Thank goodness! We hiked about seven and a half miles, stopping at the only legal campground entering the Smokies. From here on, we are required to stay in shelters and only unless they are full can we set up a tent near by. This changes our routine a bit from being able to stop whenever and wherever we can to making sure that we are hiking early enough and hard enough to make the next shelter. I have heard that fines for not complying can run as high as$600 and I would rather save my money for town expenses. We are also required to hang our food bags in the Smokies which we have not always done before. Haven't seen any bears yet, just one snake which we think was a baby rattler.

When we woke we discovered that it had trained so hard that water had leaked into the vestibule.My rain jacket was hanging over my backpack and it was wet. To make matters worse, my down whisperlite jacket had gotten wet yesterday when we hiked in the pouring rain. Water leaked in through the collar, cuffs and hem and now it was flat as a pancake! We both recognized that this was a very serious and potentially dangerous situation as it was in the low 40s and all I had to put on was a short sleeved and a long sleeved shirt...Not enough to keep me warm and prevent hypothermia. The skies were cloudy and it had not started raining yet so since I knew my rain jacket would dry quickly, we took the chance on starting to hike. If it started raining or I started shivering, we would stop and immediately pitch the tent somewhere and I would get into my sleeping bag. Gotta have a plan! The beginning of the hike was uphill and I was so hot in a very short time that when combined with a little breeze, my jacket was dry in no time at all. I was so relieved! We hiked a short day to the next shelter and when we got there in the late afternoon, we had glimpses of sunlight.

Farmor & Great Gramps ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532730,"Great Gramps here. With the Smoky Mountains behind us, here are a few observations and opinions. For anyone who knows me, they will understand that at some point I will express what may be considered as somewhat controversial ""political"" comments. For those who don't know me, well, here goes. First, the Park is certainly spectacular with stunning views when the weather permits. It is truly a remarkable national treasure. Despite many reports of sightings and activity, we did not see a single bear. A ridge runner we met went on and on about bears and seemed to be trying to instill a bit of fear about bears which I felt was inappropriate. Respect yes, safety yes, but fear is the wrong attitude to carry into bear country. From my experience, people tend to make very poor decisions when fear is present.Posters throughout the Park warn people of the norovirus which is very contagious. Despite this, hikers are told they must stay in shelters which are usually jammed with everyone literally sleeping next to each other. Although I understand the desire to keep the Park in it's natural state without tents set up everywhere, warning people about a contagious virus and then requiring everyone to be confined in close quarters is absurd.Finally, the ""leave no trace"" practice for hikers, whether thru or section, certainly makes sense. Here is what I find contradictory about all the repeated attempts to hammer home the""leave no trace"" to individuals hiking the Park. A handful of corporations have done more damage to the Appalachians than all the hikers/campers have or will ever do. It would be a wonderful thing if logging, coal, gas and other corporations were held to the same ""leave no trace"" standard. As I write this in Hot Springs, North Carolina, I am staying at a lovely old hotel next to the railroad tracks. Numerous times throughout the day and night, freight trains haul loads of coal, coal ash and molten sulfur back and forth to their destinations. ""Leave no trace"" doesn't apply at all. There is something fundamentally broken in a society that allows such a double standard.","Hot Springs

At least all of the trail had reopened and we didn't have to be rerouted.  The sun was bright but not too hot, just very muggy. We were passed by a few hikers that we had met in town and I assume Myra was way ahead of us by now as she usually starts early and walks fast!I took my second fall today. I have been so careful but I must have looked away or lost my concentration for a moment and did not see the rock under the leaves. There are so many things that go through your mind as you realize that you are going to fall. I managed to relax, not get my limbs twisted and then let the backpack take the brunt of the fall ( I hope the Oreos didn't break!).

No, they were not a part of the natural landscape but were dumped there probably to keep the trail from washing away but it made hiking very painful.

We stopped at a cemetery that the AT passed and picked some wild flowers to lay on the grave of a soldier. Last night on the news, there was an interview with a veteran who survived an attack on his platoon in Vietnam. He was the only survivor and years ago started a tradition on Memorial Day to put flowers on every slodier's grave that died in his platoon. After a few years, he expanded it to include all the soldiers in his division and is now asking for help from the public so that every veteran's grave be decorated with flowers. It was a touching story and so when a cemetery appeared out of nowhere, we had to do our part on Memorial Weekend. Later we passed by the trail to Judas Falls but did not stop (no unnecessary miles today). We replenished water at the Mountaineer Falls and then set up camp at the outskirts of the Mountaineer Shelter.

If we put the climb off till tomorrow, it would be a very long day indeed. So we don't put it off and begin the ascent, long and slow. Steep and rocky. After about a mile, Great Gramps spies a small side trail leading to a clearing which is big enough to accommodate our tent. Thank goodness! All I could think was that it was so good to be home!","Moreland Gap Shelter

We only had a little water left from yesterday and so we had to skip the coffee this morning and ration what we had. The climb which had previously been very steep and rocky changed to a nice smooth trail with few rocks which surprised us both. When we got to the water source it had almost dried up but we managed to get a few liters filtered which was enough to get us down the other side of the mountain. The trail brought us to Lake Watauga recreation area and there were people sunbathing, swimming, fishing and boating. We watched as a boy reeled in a good sized carp before releasing him, and took a nice break there in the shade before setting off again. The next three miles were part of the no camping, picnicking or loitering area due to aggressive bear activity. The woods were dark and spooky but no bears were seen. The trail followed the lake to the dam and we crossed over and had to hike up a paved, very sunny and hot road and then finally back into the woods. Found a nice campsite a few miles later and pitched tent. It was then we saw another sign that stated no camping due to bear activity but I was too tired to move on and hike any further. We hung our food away from the tent and called it a night.","Approach to pond gap

We knew that it would be at least three more miles before we would find any and so, as always, we begin the climb. Why is it always uphill? We finally find water,   drink up what we need to quench our thirst and then fill up to get us to our next source. It hasn't rained much lately so some of the sources are drying up. It was a strange day of wildlife encounters. First we saw a little frog at the creek. Then we actually passed a turtle walking north (of course)...how did he get to the top of the mountain? As we continued to hike in the heat of the day, I heard something familiar....a rattle! Great Gramps had already passed the rattlesnake without seeing or hearing it. I heard it and stopped dead in my tracks and saw the snake was coiled and rattling like crazy! We could not get it to move so I finally inched my way past keeping as far to the other side of the trail as I could and keeping my poles in front of me to try and shield myself. Needless to say, we were both rattled! (Haha). We finally got to a campsite and since it had a water source available, we decided to spend the night. Suddenly, in the campground there appeared a black cat! I am so thirsty all the time and Great Gramps is hungry all the time. And there is no surplus of either food or water.

We passed through an ""accessible"" trail and then through a cow pasture before entering the woods again. Then the skies opened and the rain pelted us. We had almost two miles to go to get to the next shelter area and the rain diminished as we got close. Great Gramps had his rain jacket draped over the tent bag so it would stay dry.

We stop at a Mexican restaurant and immediately feast and start to feel a little better. We have reserved a cabin for two days (to try and heal my blisters) but we are a day early.

As we head out from the coffee shop we meet an elderly gentlemen who stopped us and asked which way we were headed and then made the suggestion to follow the Virginia Creeper Trail north until it joined with the AT in about sixteen miles. He informed us that the trail used to be the old railroad and that it was beautifully groomed with only a slow, long grade uphill and ran along the river with about thirty tressels to cross as we go north. We decided to take his advice and were so happy we did. Today was one of the easiest and most pleasant days we have had...if only the blister didn't return! I am doomed! Tonight I begin again to doctor my feet...will it ever end? One of the highlights of the trail today was the unexpected appearance of the Virginia Creeper Cafe...a double scoop ice cream cone and a soda later, we were on our way. Great Gramps loves his new ULA backpack (his third) and his new sleeping bag (also his third). I think I need to change shoes soon, which will be my third.

We hiked a few miles and took a break at the Iron Mountain Shelter which had a nice camping/tenting area, better than most. Then we set off on a long and rocky uphill to Buzzards Rock and rationing our water as we go.

I was so discouraged and there happened to be a shuttle driver in the parking lot who offered to take us back to Damascus. Decision time. What to do? I decided to continue on slowly and stretch frequently and cut down on the distance we were trying to cover and see what happens. We continued up toward Mt Rogers, going slowly and picking our way among the rocks. We met three great ladies (Corabell?) and friends that we leapfrogged with the next couple of days.

I have been in so much pain just walking and it was wearing me down both physically and mentally. But I am not ready to give up and have this hike be over so I went through my medical supplies and got creative. After covering the blister with a hydrocolloidal dressing, I cut window dressings out of moleskin and then again with old padded Dr Schol's feet cushions and duck taped them to my foot so it would alleviate all pressure. And it worked pretty well! That and some nsaids got me through the day and I am finally doing better! We were able to hike about 10 miles and are back on track, more or less. We passed through a livestock corral and met Paul who was training his 3yo horse. He chatted for a few moments and then pulled a cold mountain dew out of his sattle bag for us to have! Unexpected trail magic! Thanks Paul! We saw Corabell and friends one more time and also met a group of 9 women, all hiking a section of the trail with large, heavy backpacks. Some of the women looked quite elderly (as though I should talk) and they were quite impressive! If they can do it, certainly I can! And the section that they were hiking was not easy so I hope they all made it safely and enjoyed themselves. We passed lots of creeks today including one deep enough that several hikers enjoyed wading in and cooling off. We had a long but well graded climb at the end of the day and camped next to a creek.

The trail improved with less rocks and no really streep inclines so life was a little bit easier today. We crossed Comer Creek and the Falls which was pretty. There were no other north bound hikers but being summer, there were many south bound day and section hikers mostly heading to see the waterfall. We crossed Dickey Gap and entered the Raccoon Wilderness and didn't see anyone else for the rest of the day until we got to camp. No raccoons either. The woods were very quiet and we were the only moving creatures in the wilderness. Kind of eerie.  We arrived earlier than expected at the shelter area so we took advantage and had a nice fire in the pit while we cooked dinner.

We hung our clothes everywhere hoping they would dry by morning but I don't think that will happen as it is supposed to rain through most of the night.   Another hiker appeared about an hour later and there was plenty of room for the four of us. We were all seniors and I found it hilarious that at the age of 65, I was the youngest one there! That will never happen again! We did not have any mice or bear encounters but we did have one hiker that had the noisiest sleeping pad ever and woke everyone every time he turned.
