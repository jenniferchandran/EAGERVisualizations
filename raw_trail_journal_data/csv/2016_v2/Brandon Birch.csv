Brandon Birch,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523047,"Here I am less then three weeks from departure. Months of planing but still this is when it gets surreal, thinking about all the trends I made and things iv learned along the way. Going on seven years crazy.I work for intermountaian health care in Murray utah in the facilities maintenance crew particularly the paint and construction. In two days I plan on siting down and telling my BOSS that I'm quiting to move to Alaska and take a short hike in between.The funny thing is last year's evaluation he asked me if anything was bothering me, I told him that I don't get the opertunity to backpack and fish much sense I started working here, he didn't take that we'll and said something along the lines of ""you better decide weather your a backpacker and fishermen OR an IHC employee!"". Kinda funny how things are ending up.","

Two weeks till my last day at intermountaian health care, one weekend with my family and then I hit the road on greyhound to Atlanta, or more less gainsville GA. Then I'm hiking to the trail head from there ... that's my approach trail!","
