Volunteer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522915,"Hello! My name is David Hester. I am 59 years old. I retired last September after 37 years in the chemical industry. I currently live in Pinehurst, TX. I grew up in East Tennessee and was introduced to the AT by my father who was an active member of the Tennessee Eastman Hiking Club. I did numerous day hikes on the AT as a child and helped my father maintain the section of the trail he was responsible for. My first overnight backpacking trip on the AT was with my brother when I was 15 years old (1970). While in high school and college (UT Knoxville), I did numerous trips with friends and a few solo trips. I have hiked the AT from Fontana Dam, NC to Damascus, VA (300+ miles). My last trip on the AT was over 30 years ago. My dream is to do a thru-hike of the AT. Today I am starting a section hike from Springer Mountain, GA to Fontana Dam (165 miles). I am hiking with Jim Beeson (Hoosier) who is starting his thru-hike. Jim and I met at an AT hiking class a year ago. - UPDATE: On 3/22, I transitioned from a section hiker going to Fontana Dam to a thru-hiker going to Maine.
- TRAILNAME: It only seemed right that if I am hiking with a guy from Indiana whose trail name is ""Hoosier"" that a guy from Tennessee should have the trail name ""Volunteer"". So Volunteer it is. Also I hope to have the volunteer spirit along the trail and help any and all along the way anyway I can make their trek to Maine or wherever they are going.",,"Fontana Dam, NC","Mar 09, Wed",0
Volunteer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523438,"Today Jim Beeson and I started off from Springer Mountain. My brother, Robbie, picked me up at the Atlanta airport yesterday and drove me to Amicalola Falls State Park. We spent the night at the lodge. Robbie shuttled me up to the Springer Mountain parking lot and we hiked the 0.9 miles out to Springer Mountain together. Then we walked back to the parking lot, I donned my backpack, and Jim Beeson (Hoosier) and I hit the trail.","Springer Mountain, GA

Volunteer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523454,"Here I am somewhere along the AT on Day 2. I rolled my right foot about 9 am and felt something pop across the top of my foot. I thought I was done but was able to walk it off. This is the foot I have been going to a podiatrist and physical therapist for for over a month to treat plantar fascitis. About an hour later, I rolled my right ankle and felt a sharp pain up the outside of my leg above my right ankle. Again, I thought I was done, but was gradually able to walk it off. I would say it was a mild ankle sprain. I tweaked it several more times that day. It was a rough day!","Hawk Mountain Shelter, GA

Volunteer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523455,"It was a tough ascent up Blood Mountain (elev 4457') on my bum ankle. It was even tougher coming down into Neel Gap as we had to walk over a long stretch of steep rocks. We overnighted at Blood Mountain Cabins. I iced my ankle that evening which helped. In the morning, I bought an ace bandage and wrapped my ankle and also bought a roll of athletic tape in case I needed to tape my ankle. I bought a set of walking polls to help my balance and to stabilize me (hand crutches!). My ankle got progressively better each day from here on.","Gooch Gap, GA

Fortunately it passed through quickly and we were on the trail by 7:40 am. It was cold, windy, muddy and misty starting off as we ascended Mt. Buckley (elev. 6590'). The sun peeked through around 9 am and we had some great views to the south. Once we got to the top, we were above the clouds. We skirted Clingman's Dome, the highest point on the AT and highest point east of the Mississippi River, and shortly thereafter passed the 200 mile mark on our trek. The rest of the day was sunny and we had a nice walk into Newfound Gap despite the muddy trail from the previous day's rain. We caught a shuttle into Gatlinburg, TN to resupply and cleanup.

It was very cold and windy starting off, probably in the upper 20s. Richard Baker, our retired National Guardsman from Grady, AL decided to end his thru-hike today. A buddy of his had a bicycle accident and got a severe head injury and had surgery. I hated to see Richard go. He was a true gentleman and a strong hiker and a nice guy to be around. Richard - if you are reading this, one day I am coming to Grady, AL and you and I are going out to eat that chicken-fried steak that we didn't have at Fontana Lodge. So now our group is back down to four and we continue on. The trees were covered in frost along the way and the trail was like walking on permafrost. We took the short side trail to Charlie's Bunion and had an incredible view.

Tri-Corner Shelter was overcapacity with 20 people crammed in so we were eager to get out of there. Lots of great views along the way. We took a short side trail to see the wreckage from the 1984 crash of an Air Force F-4 Phantom II jet near Inadu Knob (elev. 5876'). Later we took the 0.6 mi sidetrail to the Mt. Cammerer Lookout Tower built by the CCC back in the 1930s. From there you have a 360 degree panoramic view. The weather forecast was for bad weather to come in during the night so we hump-ed it the rest of the ways through the Smokies to Standing Bear Farm hostel.

We crossed over Snowbird Mtn., a grassy bald, where there is a FAA tower on the summit (elev. 4263'). We continued on and around noon and after hiking 10 miles, we reached Brown Gap. There we were treated to some fabulous trail Magic by the Orr family of Fort Worth, TX. This family of seven (father, mother, son, 4 daughters - the youngest age 8) thru-hiked the AT in 2015. They had received trail magic at Brown Gap on their thru-hike so they had driven 14 hours from Fort Worth to do the same for this year's hikers. They treated us to grilled hot dogs, sodas, chips, brownies, and sugar cookies - just what every hungry hiker craves.

I have learned that one of hikers' favorite topics of conversation is food. We continued on through town and crossed the French Broad River and then headed up our first mountain of the day, shortly passing Lover's Leap Rock. Around 10:30 am we reached Tanyard Gap and were treated to trail magic (snacks) by Melvin Roberts of Seneca, SC. Melvin was an older gentleman who claimed to have been struck by lightning 12 times, the world record. Now there's a guy I wouldn't be standing next to on a golf course during a thunderstorm! He said to google it if we didn't believe him (haven't done it yet). We walked until 5 pm and tented in a low area off the trail. It was very cold that night.

We had to climb over a boulder field up to Big Firescald Knob (elev. 4544') at mile 297.5. And now for a great customer service story. Jim and I were both wearing Brooks Cascadia 10 trail running shoes (2015 model) that had numerous reports from hikers of being defective. As one outfitter explained the problem to me, the mesh fabric would split at the metatarsil and the toe box would open up like a taco. Sure enough, after only 100 miles, both Jim's and my shoes were starting to split open. Jim called Brooks from atop Big Firescald Knob and reported the problem to Adam, the customer service person who took the call. He knew immediately the problem we were having and said we would have a pair of Cascadia 11s (2016 model with problem corrected) waiting for us in Erwin, TN when we got there two days later.

I decided I would give it my best shot to be in Damascus, VA for her to pick me up by 2 pm on Friday. This meant hiking 100 miles over the next 4 1/2 days, the most intense hiking of the trip! Steve the Hiker wanted to get to Damascus on Friday too to get gussied up before his wife, Susan, got in on Saturday to meet him. We both headed out before daylight, Steve at 5:30 am and me at 6:10 am. Jim and D.C. got a later start as they weren't trying to get to Damascus until Saturday when their wives were arriving. I hiked with my headlamp on until about 6:45 am when it was light enough to see. Steve hikes faster than I do so I didn't see him the rest of the day. I crossed Hughes Gap (elev. 4040') around 8 am. From there it was a steady climb up Roan High Knob (elev. 6193') for the next 5 miles. The trail was very icy coming down into Carvers Gap, TN (elev. 5512'). Over the next 10 miles, there are 4 exposed balds to cross - Round Bald (5813'), Jane Bald (5790'), Little Hump Mountain (5459'), and Hump Mountain (5587'). The temperature was in the mid 50s but the wind was a steady 20 mph and at times gusted up to 30 mph so it felt a lot colder. The crosswind was so strong it would blow me off the footpath. The original plan was to stay at Overmountain Shelter at Yellow Mountain Gap, which was about 4 miles past Jane Bald and about 16 miles since starting that morning. It was only 2 pm when I got there and there were 5-6 hours of daylight left. It was supposed to rain Monday night and Tuesday morning so I decided to keep going and get across the remaining balds while it was still clear. It is not a good idea to cross the balds when the weather is bad since they as are exposed and the wind, rain, and fog can make crossing difficult. I left Jim and D.C. a note in the shelter log book that I was going on. As I walked away from Overmountain Shelter and crossed the grassy area overlooking the valley below, it dawned on me that I had been here before. I had camped here on my first Boy Scout camp out when I was 11 years old back in 1967! I crossed Hump Mountain around 4:30 pm and had about 5 miles to go to Mountain Harbor Hostel. Steve had decided to stay there as well. At 5:30 pm, I passed a sign near Doll Flats at mile 390.1 that said ""Leaving NC"". I arrived at Mountain Harbor around 7 pm after hiking close to 25 miles for the day. There was a 71 year old section hiker at Mountain Harbor named ""Last Man"" who was ending his hike and parked his truck there. He had stayed at Clyde Smith Shelter with us the night before and gotten off the trail at Carvers Gap. He drove Steve and me into Roan Mountain, TN to Bob's Dairy Barn so we could get something for dinner.","Clyde Smiith Shelter, TN

Again, Steve and I separated and I didn't didn't see him until that evening. I took the short side trail to Jones Falls at mile 398.5 and spent a few minutes at this impressive falls. A short while later, I passed the 400 mile mark on the trail. I reached Dennis Cove Rd. about 5:30 pm and Black Bear Hostel was 0.5 miles to the right. The hostel was nice.

I walked across Watauga Dam and had a steady climb the rest of the afternoon from Wilbur Dam Road up the ridge overlooking Watauga Lake.

Volunteer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529126,"Kim dropped me off at the trailhead heading north from US 58 in Damascus at 11:30 am. It was a difficult good-bye after the nice three days we spent together in Abington, VA. She was driving to Knoxville to catch her flight back to Houston. As I headed up the trail, I knew this hastily-conceived thru-hike was much more difficult for her than I had imagined and also unfair. I recalled from Warren Doyle's AT seminar and also from the ""Ten Rules of Long Distance Hiking"" posted at the Top of Georgia Hostel to ""have your domestic affairs in order"". I had violated this advice / rule horribly. As I hiked on, I came to the conclusion that a thru-hike in 2016 wasn't going to happen for me. I decided then and there that completing the southern portion of the AT to Harper's Ferry, WV was a much more realistic goal, and that hopefully I would return to hike the northern section from Harper's Ferry to Katahdin in 2017. Steve the Hiker was only hiking to Harper's Ferry so that fit well with his plans. His wife Susan was going to drop him off at the US 58 trailhead sometime after 12 noon. I thought he would catch up to me fairly quickly as he is a much faster hiker than me. I hiked about 11 miles and reached a campground by a pond but still no Steve. It was around 5 pm so I decided I would cook dinner and wait for him. Steve showed up as I was finishing my dinner. I shared my decision with him. Susan had been ""pretty adamant"" that he be off the trail and back in Ohio by about May 20. Kim and I had been invited to a wedding on May 21 so we set a goal of being in Harper's Ferry by May 18. That would give us some lanyap and allow for travel time to get home. This meant we needed to cover 258 miles in 18 days or 14.3 miles per day. That seemed doable since the terrain was getting a little easier now that we were doing more ridge walking and less up and down, although we would need to resupply at least twice and would have a couple of shorter hiking days. We had our plan. We hiked on 3 more miles and arrived at Lost Mountain Shelter at 7:45 pm. We covered about 15 miles in half a day's hiking...not bad after being off the trail for three days enjoying our wife's company and the comforts of life.","Damascus, VA (US 58)

We have been hitting the trail hard each day, usually on the trail by daylight (6:30 am) and hiking until around 7 pm each day, and sometimes longer in my case since I don't walk as fast as Steve the Hiker, my hiking partner. Since leaving Damascus around noon on April 18, we covered the 259 miles to Daleville in 12.5 days, averaging 20.7 miles per day including 2 resupply days when we had to hitch into towns and get back out to the trail. About a week ago, I developed a problem with my lower right leg. I caught my right foot several times on rocks coming downhill through a very rocky section of trail. I thought I had hyper-extended my right foot and strained the tendons between my foot and lower leg. I have been walking on my bum leg for about a week, hoping I could walk through the injury. When I got to Daleville on Saturday night after the 27 mile slackpack from Four Pines Hostel, I was in quite a bit of pain and couldn't put any weight on my right leg. My lower right leg was red and swollen and tender to touch. I went to a clinic this morning to have it checked. It turns out I have a skin infection (cellulitis) that probably occurred through one of the cuts on my legs that settled in my lower leg. The doctor gave me a tetanus shot and prescribed a broad spectrum antibiotic to get the infection under control. Also, she told me I needed to rest for 48 hours and if the swelling went down I could gradually resume activity...and if not I needed to promptly go to the ER.After Damascus, I realized I had violated one of the 10 cardinal rules of thru-hiking posted at the Top of Georgia Hostel in Dicks Gap, GA. The only two I remember are 1) Have you domestic affairs in order and 2) Don't quit on a bad day. I totally blew it on #1 and have no one to blame but myself. Without much notice, I left on a 16 day / 165 mile section hike on March 9. I got sucked in by the trail and called my wife 10 days later telling her I wanted to do the whole trail. It didn't seem like such a big ask at the time but it sure does now. Steve needed to get off the trail mid-May so we set a more realistic goal of going to Harpers Ferry, WVA (1023 miles and almost 1/2 of the AT) and coming back next year to do the other half. With my leg issue, that isn't going to happen now. But I did get in 53 days / 728 miles which is respectable for a 59 year old geezer. We reached Daleville toward the low end of the range for the 5 month pacing guide (45-63 days) we were following. So with that, this hike is officially coming to an end. I will go back and update my journal using the notes I took along the way on my AWOLs NOBO trail guide. I look forward to coming back next year and finishing the AT. There are some benefits to this, i.e. we can apply our learnings from this trip and tweak our gear to make next year's hike even more enjoyable. And we will probably go a little slower so we can enjoy the trail more.One final comment...aside from the amazing natural beauty of the AT, I have met many truly remarkable people over the course of my hike. There have been many fine young people along the way - some between college and first careers, some transitioning from one career to another, and some taking the time to think about what they want to do next. Also, there have been many retired people like me enjoying some time in the great outdoors after a long career. And there have quite a few military veterans on the trail whom I have the greatest admiration and respect for after hearing their stories.

I am starting in Daleville, VA at mile 728 where I stopped on May 1 due to my leg infection issue. So after 7 months I am finally hitting the trail again. I had plans to get back out sooner but some other health issues came up. Those are under control now thanks to my crack medical team (Thanks, Dr. Ertan and team). On this trip I am hoping to get to Harper's Ferry, WV (mile 1023) by 11/22 so close to 300 miles in the next 20 days. This will be roughly half of the AT in 2016 with plans to do the other half in 2017. This trip required quite a bit more planning than my previous trip. On that trip, somehow I developed food allergies...perhaps due to my hiker diet of tortillas, peanut butter, Snickers bars, processed food, and the like. My gastroenterologist has banned me from wheat, eggs, dairy, shellfish, soy, and peanuts. As a result I have kept all my weight off and am hitting the trail at a relatively sleek 199 lbs vs the 220 lbs I started at Springer Mountain, GA in early March. I bought a dehydrator and prepared 60 breakfast, lunches, and dinners for the next 20 days containing none of the banned food ingredients. My wife, Kim, will be mailing my food drops to me every 5 days or so at various points along the trail. Talk about a Trail Angel! I used the book ""Recipes for Adventure"" written by a gourmet chef who is a backpacker to prepare my meals. It was a lot of work but will be good to eat healthier on the trail. Joining me for this hike is Jim Beeson (Hoosier) from Roanoke who I hiked with earlier this year and who completed the entire AT in August and Steve Toth (Steve the Hiker) from Cleveland, OH who I also hiked with earlier this year and who completed the section from Springer to Harper's Ferry back in May. Jim is meeting me at the airport today and we will spend the night at his house in Roanoke. His wife, Jill, will take us to the trailhead in Daleville in the morning and we will start hiking. Jim will join me for a tbd portion of the hike and Steve will meet up with us/me around 11/11 and hike back to where he is parking his truck. Should be fun. Both Jim and Steve are great guys and great hikers who I met at Warren Doyle's Appalachian Trail Institute in April 2015. Stay tuned!

There I talked to a retired Army black hawk helicopter pilot who flew missions in Afghanistan. His name was Billie Bob and his dog, a Corgey, was named Bowson. Some guys day hiking came past the shelter and we asked who won the election and that's how we found out Trump won. It was cold, windy, drizzling, and rocky most of the afternoon. I decided to try to make it to Paul C. Wolfe Shelter, which would make 20.6 miles for the day and leave only 5 miles into Waynesboro tomorrow where I am picking up my next food drop and meeting up with Steve Toth, who will hike north with me for the next 5 days / 100 miles through the Shenandoah National Park. It got dark around 5:30 pm and I still had two miles to go to the shelter. I put on my headlamp and night hiked to the shelter, arriving around 6:45 pm. I cooked dinner and promptly went to bed, staying in the shelter. It was a long day but a good day. I only met one SOBO thru-hiker today: Wifi (M) from Buffalo. There was one thru-hiker at the shelter but he wasn't very talkative. He was asleep when I got there and asleep when I left in the morning. I'm not sure if he is going to make it!","Three Ridges Mountain

Volunteer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551372,"I didn't get much sleep last night as I don't carry a foam pad anymore since going to a hammock and I was sleeping on the hard wood shelter floor. Also it must have in the low 30s. I created what padding / insulation I could with my rain jack, puffy jacket, and small foam sit pad and laid on that in my sleeping bag in my long John's. I left the Paul C. Wolfe Shelter at 7 am and began the 5 miles to US 250 and the BRP. Waynesboro is 3.7 mi to the west and is a town of 22,000 people with a reputation for being a hiker-friendly town. Coming out of the woods and up the road embankment, there was a small sign on the back of the guard rail with a list of Trail Angels who will provide free transportation in the Waynesboro area. I took a picture of it withi my phone as it suggested. It had really gotten cold and windy so I put another layer on and called the first name on the list, Steve Doherty. Steve answered, I told him where I was, and he was there in 10 minutes. Wow! Steve wouldn't take any money as this is strictly a volunteer program. Steve lived and worked in Manhattan for 31 years in the publishing business. He retired from that and he and his wife wanted to find a less congested place with lower taxes. They fell in love with the Waynesboro area. He now works for an online publishing company from his home downtown so it is no problem for him to pick up a hiker whenever he gets a call. Steve took me to the Quality Inn where Steve the Hiker arrived last night after hiking as far as he could (50 miles) from Mountain Home Cabbin in Front Royal, VA where he parked his truck on Tuesday and got a shuttle the rest of the way here yesterday evening. We will start hiking back to Front Royal in the morning covering the 100 miles through the Shenandoah National Park over the next five days. My food drop got delivered to the Quality Inn and I started going through my food and the revised itinerary for the next part of the trip (5 days vs. 7 days). I decided to mail my excess food back home after giving Steve some to try while we are hiking. The Quality Inn is close to the small downtown district and within easy walking distance of where we needed to go. We went to the post office to mail my food and then we found a nice place to eat called The Green Leaf Grill on the recently renovated Main Street. I was famished as I hadn't cooked breakfast and only had a couple of snacks while hiking to the Waynesboro trailhead. I had a pulled pork gluten-free wrap, fries and cole slaw for $9. It was excellent. From there we walked to Kroger to pick up a few items we each needed. I picked a few ""dietary approved"" non-cook items to supplement my dehydrated food so we could maximize our hiking time during the day. We walked back to the motel and next I needed to go Rockfish Gap Outfitters. RGO was not in walking distance so I got out my trail angel list again and called the second name, John Lowdermilk. John was there in 10 minutes and dropped us off at RGO. Wow, I am liking this town! John grew up in Waynesboro but left and lived in CA for 40 years. He convinced his wife who is from NY to move back here 5 years ago. She was skeptical but they both really love living here now. The main reason for the trip to RGO was to get repair items to splint the broken carbon fiber rod on my backpack until I get the fiberglass replacement parts mailed to me in Front Royal. RGO was a great store and the owner helped me find everything I needed. We needed to get a ride back to the Quality Inn so I got out the trail angel lost again to call the third name on the list, Dubose ""Yellow Truck"" Egleston. I asked the owner if he knew Yellow Truck and he said ""he's sitting right behind you"". Dubose, a slightly portly local fellow said he would be glad to give us a ride. A lady ran into him In his yellow truck so he is driving an old gold truck while he waits for a new yellow truck. He only had a single cab so Steve got in the back (there were no chickens). When I opened the passenger door to get in, several empty beverage cups and a couple of empty gallon plastic jugs fell out onto the pavement. Shine perhaps? Nah, probably just sweet tea jugs. I threw them back in, jumped in, and we were off. Dubose is picking us up at 8 am to take us back to the trailhead. We ordered Pizza Hut delivered to the room so we could start getting our backpacks together for tomorrow. I had a gluten-free pepperoni and sausage pizza with no cheese which was quite tasty, especially when you haven't had a pizza in 6 months! Back on the trail in the morning! Waynesboro is a great town with the friendliest people you have ever met that go out of their way to cater to hikers. Wow!","Paul C. Wolfe Shelter

It is pre-1840 and served as slave quarters on a 3000 acre horse and cattle farm. It has also been a surveyor's office and tri-county seat. The cabin is logs underneath and has a brick veneer on it.

The trail heading north out of Lehigh Gap is extremely step (>1000 ft in 1 mile). It is supposedly the most difficult section of trail south of NH. it is not recommended to make this climb if the rocks are wet and slippery or in the heat of day due to the possibility of heat exhaustion. We had nearly perfect conditions for climbing. We were starting at 9 am so still had strong legs. The temperature was in the low 70s, there was a light breeze, and we had cloud cover blocking the sun. It took us about an hour to make the climb. You had to keep your pack weight forward and lean into the rocks to avoid losing your balance and falling backwards. We were all happy to make it up and have this difficult stretch of trail behind us. We reached Little Gap Rd around noon and had already hiked about 12 miles. Someone had left trail magic there, which included cold soft drinks, chips, chocolate, brownies, and a 5 gal water container for filling water bottles.

A young hiker from Macon, GA named All Star driving support for his father who is hiking the AT offered to take me into Blairstown. First we went to the PO and got the quilt. Then All Star took me to the only grocery store in town which was actually a pretty good one. I spent about 20 minutes going up and down the aisles getting items that are on my diet. We got back to the Mohican Outdoor Center, I thanked All Star and gave him a $20 for taking me into town, and did a quick reload and repack of my food bag with the items I had bought.

Many times during the day the trail had a stream running down the middle of it. I did a lot of rock hopping and looking for logs or roots to step on to stay out of the muck. A couple of times the suction from the mud almost pulled my shoe off. This was very tiring and not natural walking. I had several slips, trips too numerous to count, but amazingly no falls. I made it to Goddard Shelter at 7 pm. I was one tired puppy. I should sleep good tonight. It is supposed to get down to 47! Happy 4th of July! God Bless America!","Seth Warner Shelter

Stratton Pond Shelter was 19.4 miles and I wanted to get at least to there. Today I surrendered to the mud. Yesterday it wore me out so I decided to try a different tactic. Yesterday I had tried to pick my way through each patch of mud hopping from anything that would support my weight like rocks, roots, downed trees, etc. Today I decided not to fight the mud and just walk right through it. It was hard to do at first after being told all your life to stay out of the mud. After a while I had my size 12.5 shoe gliding through the mud like a pro. It was actually much easier and less tiring to do it this way. I know one 6 year old boy, Cole Mayhew, who lives near Anacortes, WA who would have had a blast in the mud on the trail today. His mom would not have been very happy with him though when he came home covered in black mud from head to toe. I had a good morning and took advantage of the cool weather. I had 12 miles in by noon. I had a long climb up Stratton Mountain (3940') and went up the fire tower when I got to the summit. I reached Stratton Pond Shelter at 4:15 pm. It was too early to stop walking and I didn't want to waste the daylight. Prospect Rock was 5.8 mikes further and had a good view plus the terrain was pretty easy other than the mud. I got there at 7 pm, set up my hammock and ate my dinner while the sun was going down. Tomorrow I only have 4.8 miles into Manchester Center.

I was there at 8 am and began trying to hitch into town. Twenty or so cars passed without slowing down, mostly luxury SUVs and sedans, who I am sure did not want a smelly hiker in their car. Then an old truck came around the curve and stopped and I threw my stuff in back and jumped in the cab. A crusty old early morning tobacco chewing log cutter named Peter Salo with Finnish ancestry provided plenty of local color as we rode the 5 miles into town. I was hungry for a good breakfast so Peter dropped me off at the Little Rooster Cafe. I had a nice breakfast and several cups of coffee. From there I went to Ted's Barbershop for a haircut and beard trimming. Then it was to the Price Chopper to pick up a few food items. Next I went to the Mountain Goat Outfitter to get one of my hiking poles fixed and to get a new bag for my Sawyer water filter which had developed a pin hole leak. One more stop at the Rite-Aid drug store and I was getting hungry again so I had lunch at Cilantro Burrito. I had one last stop at the post office to mail home a few items I wasn't using to reduce my pack weight a little. Then I called Jeff Taussig from Green Mountain Home and he was there in 5 minutes to pick me up. He and his wife Regina have a great hostel with everything a hiker needs. Jeff has section hiked the AT. I got a shower and did my laundry and relaxed the rest of the day.

It was nice to have on shoes that were broken in but not broken down. Unfortunately they will not stay nice very long since the forecast is for rain which means more mud. I also had on the compression leg sleeves I ordered to give them a try. The main purpose is to keep my legs from getting nicked and cut up and to keep the dirt and mud off them.

I reached Cooper Lodge Shelter around 10 am and took a break. I checked my phone which has been acting up a lot lately. It got moisture in it during a rain storm a couple of weeks ago and hasn't been the same since. I had used it to take a couple of pictures on the way up the mountain and it was fine but when I checked it the screen was gray with vertical lines. I tried jump starting it with my battery pack which has worked over the last week or so but not even that was working now. A hiker at Cooper Shelter said the view from Killlington Peak was great. I left my pack in the Shelter and took the 0.2 mile side trail up to the summit. It was rocky and straight up. It was cold and windy on top. The view to the west was really nice. There was a huge   antenna and some other communications equipment on top that blocked the view to the east. I had my phone in my pocket plugged in to my external battery pack hoping it would start working again so I could take a picture when I reached the top. Wasn't happening...my phone has developed a mind of its own and only works when it wants to now...very frustrating especially since I have a hiking trail app that has detailed information about each section of the AT I am hiking that I refer to throughout the day. I reached the VT 4 highway crossing around 2 pm after about 10 miles. I checked my phone again and the home view came up but the touch screen kept locking up. Rutland, VT is about 8 miles to the west from here. I decided I needed to go into Rutland and get my phone issues resolved. Unfortunately we get so dependent on our cellphones it is hard to function without them. It made me think back to when I was 17 years old and my mother dropped me off in Elk Park, NC for a 5 day solo backpacking trip and all I had in terms of electronics / information was a flashlight and a paper trail guide! Anyway, I need a reliable phone so I can order medicine tomorrow for delivery to Hanover, NH so it will be there on Wednesday when I get there. Another hiker came along and was going into Rutland. We called the local taxi and split the cab fare. I asked the driver if there was an AT&T store there. There was and it was open until 5 pm. I was surprised since it was Sunday. She took me there. It was 3:30 pm when I arrived. Darrell who helped me was very good and confirmed my phone had water damage. He was surprised it was working at all.

It was a very steep ascent for me for the first two miles. This is the second steepest ascent on the AT (3500' in 2 miles). It was hand over hand combat with the rocks going up.

My main concern was they dropped off at 7:45 am and picked up at 5:30 pm so there was less than 10 hours hiking time and little time for breaks, at least at my hiking pace. The other hikers were faster than me so I brought up the rear. I had a steep climb to start up Mt. Wolf. It only got steeper as I headed up South Kinsman with a rocky ascent for the next 2.5 miles. There were several boggy areas I had to navigate through along the way. I reached the top of South Kinsman around 2 pm and joined the other hikers for a quick lunch. Then we headed over North Kinsman and began the descent. The sky to the west began to darken and it looked like rain. I passed the Kinsman Pond Shelter around 3 pm. The sky got darker and I could hear thunder in the distance. I caught up to another hiker and we picked up the pace to get off the mountain as fast as we could. We passed the Lonesome Lake Hut and had about 2 miles to go to the pickup point. By this time the sky was dark  and the thunder and lightning was closer but the rain held off. We made it to the van about 10 minutes late. The bottom fell out just as we got there. At the hostel, there had been a hailstorm and the power was out. It took several hours for the utility crews to fix the downed power lines in North Woodstock and get the power back on. I got a ride into town and ate at a Mexican Restaurant.

I stayed for breakfast at the Lake of the Clouds Hut which consisted of cold oatmeal and hot coffee for those doing ""work for stay"". There were a dozen or so hikers like myself who slept on the dining hall floor last night. Believe me, it was well worth the price of admission to have gone over Mt. Jackson and Mt. Pierce and skirted Mt. Eisenhower and Mt. Monroe yesterday and be only 1.5 miles and 1200' from the summit of Mt. Washington. There was a heavy cloud cover and you couldn't even see Mt. Washington which had been clearly visible yesterday evening when I hiked in. I left the Hut at 8:30 am and was at the summit of Mt. Washington at 9:30 am. Unfortunately there would be no clear view from on top for at least a couple of hours until the clouds burned off. I had a hard day of hiking ahead so I continued on. The rest of the day I spent ""bouldering"", walking from cairn to cairn (rocks stacked in small towers to show the direction of the trail). I reached the Madison Hut at 2:30 pm and had my lunch there. From there I headed up a short but steep rocky 0.5 miles to Mt. Madison where I was climbing on all fours vs. walking most of the way. Coming down off Mt. Madison is the worst descent on the AT. It was 3000' over 3 miles with the first 2 miles being over exposed rock fields leading down, up, and over shoulders on the mountain. The wind picked up with gusts I am guessing were 25-30 mph which wanted to blow me off course. Again, there was no clear trail and it was rock hopping across boulders to the next cairn. The last mile crossed the tree line and it was good to have cover and be off the exposed rocks. It was a steep downhill from here to Osgood Campsite where I camped along with a couple other hikers. It was a tough day of hiking. I felt pretty beat up and both knees were aching from all the downhill. Earlier in the day I had tripped on a not terribly difficult stretch of trail and almost did a face plant but caught myself at the last minute. You have to concentrate on every step and not let your mind wonder. The Presidentials were beautiful and the views were incredible but they were tough hiking.","Lake of the Clouds Shelter

I talked to some day hikers when I was 30 minutes out and they said there was a cafeteria there with a good breakfast. I hustled the rest of the way and got there 5 minutes before they shutdown the breakfast buffet at 9 am. I loaded up a plate with scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, 2 pancakes, fried potatoes, and a cranberry muffin (yes, I broke training). I downed all this along with 3 cups of coffee. All this for $7! With plenty of hiker fuel in me, I started the steep ascent up the Wildcat Ridge Trail which is the same as the AT through this area. This trail goes over Wildcat Peaks E, D, C, and A, all ranging from 4000-4400'. The 6 miles from Pinkham Notch to Carter Notch Hut is the hardest 6 miles on the AT in the opinion of our AT hiking class instructor. The 3 miles up was very intense rock scrambling going up on all fours a good bit of the way. It leveled off somewhat on top Wildcat Mountain and was very steep down into Carter Notch. I reached the Hut at 4:30 pm. I asked about ""work for stay"" similar to what I did at Lake of the Clouds Hut two nights ago. They only had two worker spots and I got the second one. Dinner was turkey, mashed potatoes with gravy, corn, cranberry sauce, bread, and peach pie, however all the turkey was gone when they called me in to eat at 8 pm.

The day started with a 0.5 mile steep rocky ascent out of Carter Notch (3293') about like the one out of Pinkham Notch yesterday. I was not ready for that the first thing in the morning.

I arrived at the White Mountains Lodge and Hostel, which is right on the trail, around 5 pm where I stayed last night. I shared a room with ""Terminator"", the Australian bush walker I have been camping in the same spots with for the last week. He is a spitting image of Crocodile Dundee. His Australian accent reminds me of my former co-workers from Down Under at Huntsman. I slept like a log last night. I am taking a zero today (not hiking) to give my body a rest after the Whites. This is the first day since I started at Harpers Ferry (53 days ago) that I have not hiked, although I have had a few low mile days going into towns. I think I deserve and need a break.

Mahoosuc Notch is a deranged jumble of boulders in a cleft between Mahoosuc Mtn. and another mountain that is 0.8 miles long. It can take 1-2 hours to get through.

Jailbird, one of the guys I have been hiking with the last week, decided to take the canoe out. He jumped in and paddled away from shore but didn't notice the canoe had a rope with a small anchor attached. When he got about 10 yards out into the pond, the canoe ""tumped"" over as we like to say in Texas. It was a hoot...he looked like a drowned rat.

We took the logging road and came to a hunting cabin. There were a couple of other hikers there. We were warmly greeted by Scout and Birdman. Scout provides Trail Magic to hikers to honor his late son who thru-hiked the AT in 1994. As soon as we walked up, they gave us a seat on the porch, Birdman threw a hot dog and hamburger on the grill for each of us, and they showed us a cooler with anything you could possibly want to drink. Scout handed me a copy of the January 2017 issue of Backpacker magazine in which they had been featured (see photos). We visited with them for an hour and enjoyed the food and fellowship and got a tour of the hunting cabin, then headed on our way. I can't remember any better Trail Magic than this. We had about 8 miles to go from here so the early afternoon treat definitely was a shot in the arm. We reached Cloud Pond Lean-to around 7 pm. It was a great first day in the 100 Mile Wilderness!","ME 15 / Monson

Volunteer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575168,I left the Cloud Pond Lean-to at 6:45 am. The plan was to do almost 18 miles today to the Sidney Tappan Campsite. We had another day of great weather. We had a lot of climbing in the morning over Chairback Mtn. which consists of four peaks. After lunch we forded the W. Branch Pleasant River which was 100 feet wide and shin deep. This is the last ford on the trail. The trail flattened out after this and followed the Gulf Hagas Brook for the next couple of miles. We had a 700' climb late in the day up Gulf Hagas Mtn. just before reaching the campsite. It was another good day in the 100 Mile Wilderness. We are hoping to do about 20 miles tomorrow so we will only have 11 miles on Saturday into White House Landing so we can enjoy the afternoon there.,"Cloud Pond Lean-to

Volunteer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575169,"Today we had our last major climbs before Mt. Katahdin. First thing this morning we climbed a combined 1500' up West Peak (3181'), Hay Mountain (3244'), and White Cap Mountain (3644'). We started hiking shortly before 7 am and had these done by 9 am. The clouds rolled in and we didn't have much of a view from White Cap. However, off to the west we could faintly see Mt. Katahdin in the distance about 70 trail miles away. This was my first view of Mt. Katahdin from anywhere along the trail. The top of it was above the clouds. After lunch we had another 500' climb up Little Boardman Mountain (2017'). We passed by Crawford Pond and the next 8 miles to Jo-Mary road were relatively flat. I got there about 5:30 pm. Terminator got there 30 minutes ahead of me and had a stealth campsite next to a steam picked out. Tomorrow we have 11 miles to the pickup point to White House Landing. We want to get there by noon so will get an early start so we can enjoy the afternoon at the fishing camp. We have seen fewer and fewer SOBOs on the trail the last couple of days. All the SOBO thru-hikers have passed by. Occasionally we will see a flip-flopper heading south from Katahdin to Harpers Ferry or elsewhere. Several times people have stopped to talk and congratulated us on finishing the AT. They are sincerely happy for us impressed with the accomplishment. How often does a total stranger come up to you and say something like that? We are really kindred spirits who love the outdoors and hiking and not strangers at all. They know what it takes to make the dream a reality and all the things that can stop if from happening.","Sidney Tappan Campsite

Volunteer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575176,"I was on the trail at 6 am. Terminator was still asleep in his tent when I headed out. The terrain was mostly flat but did have sections with a lot of rocks and/or roots. I passed the Antlers Campsite at 4 miles that Poet at Shaw's said was one of his favorite places. It was a large mostly open camping area sloping down to the shore of Lower Jo-Mary Lake. I continued on and reached the Mahar Tote Trail about 10:15 am. From here it was  0.3 miles to the dock on Pemadumcook Lake, the fifth largest lake in Maine, where White House Landing is located. I laid out on the dock and waited for Terminator who got there about 20 minutes later. We called Bill at White House Landing and he came and picked us up in his aluminum boat with a 25 hp Yamaha. We were at the fishing camp in 10 minutes. Bill and his wife, Linda, run the camp. It was a picture postcard setting...absolutely beautiful. They reopened in 2016 after being closed for two years. They live at the camp year-round. The lake freezes over in the winter. They get snowmobilers and ice fishermen in the winter and have a spring fishing season for trout and lake bound salmon, but hikers are the base of their business. We had a one room cabin with a great view of the lake. Linda's zucchini bread made with fresh zucchini from their garden and blueberries picked on site was delicious! For dinner I had a hamburger. Earlier in the afternoon Betty from the next camp over dropped by and told us they had too much food and invited us to come over. We visited with Steve and Betty and Tom, LeeAnne, Tommy and Meagan, all from NH for an hour and a half. They treated us to chips and salsa and a couple of PBRs. Betty packed us a bag with biscuits, cinnamon rolls, and fresh plums for our hike tomorrow. More unexpected Trail Magic! I  am looking forward to breakfast tomorrow morning which consists of eggs, bacon, AYCE blueberry pancakes, orange juice, and coffee. More hiker fuel for the next 2 days and 40 miles to get to Mt. Katahdin. It is hard to believe the journey will be over in 3 days. Tomorrow will be our last night to camp out on the trail.","Jo-Mary Road

Volunteer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575178,"We had a nice breakfast at White House Landing, then Bill us took back across the lake in his boat and dropped us at the dock on the other side. We were back on the AT at 8:45 am hiking north. We planned to hike 19 miles to the Rainbow Spring Campsite. We had a 800' climb over Nesuntabunt Mountain before lunch. I enjoyed the Trail Magic goodies for lunch that Betty from NH had given us yesterday. The trail was pretty flat other than that although there were a lot of rocks, roots, and mud. We passed a couple of viewpoints where you can normally see Mt. Katahdin, but it was too cloudy today to get a good view. In the afternoon, we walked along Rainbow Stream Cascades, a series of scenic sluices and cascading falls. We reached the campsite around 6 pm. I put my hammock up for the final time on this trip. Tomorrow night we will be at AT Lodge in Millinocket. We have 11 miles to Abol Bridge in the morning and then enter Baxter State Park. From there we have 10 more miles to Katahdin Stream Campsite where the shuttle to the AT Lodge will meet us at 6 pm. Almost there!","Mahar Tote Road

Volunteer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575189,"Terminator and I were on the trail at 6:15 am. We did the 11 miles to Abol Bridge, arriving at 10:30 am and exiting the 100 Mile Wilderness. We stopped in the store there and grabbed a sandwich for an early lunch. A trail steward was there and told us what we needed to do to enter Baxter State Park. We entered the park around 11:45 am and registered. We did the remaining 10 miles and reached the ranger station at Katahdin Steam Campground at 3:30 pm. We got our permits for going up Mt. Katahdin tomorrow. Several hikers we knew had summited Katahdin today and had just come down. We congratulated them and got their advice on which trail to come down on. Everyone goes up the Hunt Trail because this is the AT but there are a couple of different ways to come down. The shuttle from the AT Lodge picked us up at 5 pm and took us into Millionocket. We got showers, started our laundry, and went to the Scootic Restaurant across the street. Again we saw several hikers who had summited Katahdin today and congratulated them. All were in a celebratory mood. Most are heading home tomorrow so there were a lot of parting good-bye hugs and fist bumps. Tomorrow it will be our turn.

Volunteer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575243,"I was at the AT Cafe at 5 am for breakfast. I had the hiker special - 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, 2 blueberry pancakes, potatoes, and coffee...hiker fuel I would need today. I also ordered a hiker lunch to eat on Katahdin. Ole Man (Paul) from the AT Lodge took us back into Baxter State Park at 6:30 am and dropped us at the Katahdin Stream Campground ranger station. Terminator and I gave each other a fist bump, said ""let's do this"" and ""Vaya Con Dios"", and hit the Hunt Trail at 7:30 am. The trail started easy but quickly steepened as we began the 4200' ascent over the 5.2 miles to the top. We had clear skies as we headed up. The first third was rocky and rooty below the tree-line, the second third was climbing boulders above the tree line, and the final third was flatter but boulder hopping similar to in the Whites. It took us 3 hours to do the 5.2 miles to the 5267' summit. We got there at 10:30 am and took pictures at the summit sign. The viewing conditions really change quickly on the summit. One minute it would be clear and a few minutes later a cloud would roll in and obscure the view. I took a few pictures from the top including Knifes Edge, another trail off Katahdin. We started heading down and had our lunch just before climbing down the exposed boulders. We made it back to the bottom of the mountain at 2 pm. I didn't feel that tired after the steep ascent and steep descent over the combined 10.4 miles. Terminator and I both thought we were running on adrenaline. We got a hitch back into Millinocket with the first car we asked. On the hour long ride into Millinocket is when it hit us and we felt tired. We were back at the AT Lodge at 3:30 pm. After getting cleaned up we headed to Angelo's for our celebratory dinner. It feels great to have accomplished a lifetime dream. It will take a few days for this to sink in. In the meantime, I want to thank everyone again for their support, encouragement, and prayers, especially my wife, Kim, without whose support I could never had done this.
