Alyssa ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520383,"I almost couldn't believe it the other day when I counted less than 90 days until I start my thru. I pushed my start date back a week to April 24, figured I'd give myself a little more leeway should my feet somehow make it to Maine. Now with 86 days until I step off from Springer, I can feel the reality starting to set in. But more than that, I'm just plain excited!

Alyssa ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520590,"This is partially an obligatory post to get this journal publically visible on the web, and also an admission of my total and utter failure to be physically prepared for this hike the way I had hoped I would be by this time. Chalk it up to sheer laziness--I ""took off"" the months of November, December, and January, for some reason (granted I was busy with work and holidays and all the shenanigans that go along with those [and I also managed to purchase a good 80 percent of my gear during that time] as well as successfully completing my third consecutive NaNoWriMo [google it]). Ok that was a lot, so maybe it wasn't all laziness, but I admit I enjoy sleeping in on the weekend after a stressful week of work. Also there's something about winter's short cold days that saps my motivation.But now it's February and I have no excuse. Yesterday the temps reached a balmy 75 degrees (welcome to Florida) so I finally decided to hit up a local park. I did a solid 5 miles over moderate terrain that weaved up and down and in and out of gullies and across open spaces shaded by old, majestic moss-draped oaks--in the small amount of time I had between work and picking up the bro from soccer practice and then shooting straight to a bible study. Pretty good for a Monday. The blister on my right sole just proves that I can't get away with my previous non-activity.And I still need to purchase trekking poles. Seriously considering Pacer Poles. I get paid tomorrow so we'll see.",,View Entry,"Feb 02, Tue",0
Alyssa ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520591,I found this great website where you can buy just about anything you might need for a thru hike in bulk: Minimus.biz They carry everything from first aid and otc medication to food and drinks to mini rolls of duct tape.One can never have too much tea.,,View Entry,"Feb 03, Wed",0
Alyssa ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520670,"Things are really starting to come together. I'm officially registered with the ATC, my base weight is scratching the surface of 15 pounds, and I've decided that powdered milk and instant coffee aren't so bad.I'll probably throw a gear list up here at some point, or maybe I should start a blog that's more html friendly. Problem is in the past I've never been able to post consistently on my attempted blogs. I think I'd be satisfied with just hopping on here to post my daily mileage, and anything interesting that happened on the trail (and off). I honestly don't even know what my expectations are for this. I'm just so extremely ready to get on the trail and start taking it one step at a time. ONLY 80 DAYS TO GO.",,View Entry,"Feb 04, Thu",0
Alyssa ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520715,"I've settled on Black Diamond poles. I found a pair of barely used Distance FLZs for 80 bucks and my bank account deserved it. The Pacers seemed great, but the Black Diamonds saved me $50, which I spent on a food bag from ZPacks, since apparently that cuben fiber makes it harder for little critters to get to your grub.I've literally only got one major purchase left to figure out--of course, the most important one: SHOES! I've already been told Salomons are the best, but I'll have to test run some for myself first.Oh man, things are really coming together. *bounces in seat* Also can't wait to hit the trail this Saturday for another shakedown. I've got to take advantage of these cold temps while I can.",,View Entry,"Feb 05, Fri",0
Alyssa ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520919,"I know some of you might be aware that I deleted some earlier posts and also cleared out the guestbook. This is primarily because some of those posts contained personal things that frankly had no business being public on the internet, but I had written them in the heat of the moment and felt that this website in particular would offer me an audience who could back me up--or at least encourage me. It was all part of the journey to get to where I am now--just 75 days from the start of my hike.I'm looking at starting out slow--keeping my mileage under 8.5 miles/day and arriving at Neel's Gap on day 4--for starters. I know myself and I know that on day hikes I tend to hike too fast. Maybe it's because it's not second nature for me to think longterm, or maybe it's my long legs, or maybe it's my need for speed. But a thru hike like this requires a lot of regard for longevity and I DON'T want to screw this up. So I will probably be one of the slower hikers to start out, but HYOH right? Can't make it to Katahdin if I've jacked up my feet in the first 30 miles. Slow and steady wins the race, and all that.I'm still not happy with the way this website works. I think I just need my own platform, so I will probably start a blog at some point in the next month. I'm also planning on posting a gear vid on youtube, and maybe I will film bits of my hike too. I just know that I spent the better part of August to October last year literally devouring every youtube thru hiker video I could find. Overkill maybe, but it really helped me get my brain in gear and figure out how I wanted to go about making this hike happen.Lastly, I ordered the book Appalachian Trials from Amazon. I've been spending a lot of time on Zach Davis' website lately because it is chock full of interesting, informative, and funny articles. And I need to read more.",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Tue",0
Alyssa ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520926,"Just wanted to add real quick: just the idea of this is so surreal. I'm really going to do this? Attempt to hike 2,189 miles from Georgia to Maine? Okey dokey Alyssa.",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Tue",0
Alyssa ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521275,"...well, 67 days to Amicalola. 68 to stepping down from Springer. I'm planning to try shoes on Thursday, and hopefully will be able to get a decent hike in on Saturday to try my new-to-me trekking poles.Also got my blog up and running (mostly). Will post the url here after I've actually made a decent post.I'm literally itching to get on with my hike. Literally. April can't come fast enough!",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Tue",0
Alyssa ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526430,"Oops I haven't updated this since mid-February, but I have been busy. Yesterday marked exactly three weeks until my start date. I've managed to make it out to Torreya a few times and each time I learned something new, whether it was about my gear or my body, or about the fact that I need to eat more when I hike than I currently do. The worst part about these day hikes is having to get back to my car before the sun sets. I'm hoping to actually get out and camp this weekend, but work and weather haven't been helpful up until now.I've started a blog that my friends and family can more easily follow at alyssathruhikes.wordpress.com so feel free to check it out and follow me there. I'll be posting photos and updates there more often than here most likely. Since I'll be blogging on my iPad, I prefer the layout of Wordpress to Trailjournals. I'm also hoping to be able to post some video footage on Youtube as well once I start my hike. I've never vlogged before but I did a lot of my initial research and learning about the AT on Youtube so I want to contribute to that resource for future hikers.Still cant quite believe my start date is right around the corner and I absolutely can't wait to be on the trail and starting the next season of my life. This hike has been 7 months in the making and I can't wait to see what the white blazes will bring!Alyssa",,View Entry,"Apr 04, Mon",0
