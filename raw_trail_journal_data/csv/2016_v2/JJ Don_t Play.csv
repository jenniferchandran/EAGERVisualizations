JJ Don't Play,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528991,"Well the day finally came.One thing I realized so for with this adventure is the unintentional reoccurrence of the #18. 2/18 I joined white blaze ( an AT forum) to start seriously considering this, 3/18 was my last day at work, and 4/18 is my start date. I stayed at the hiker hostel in Dahlonega GA the ivy before which was really nice they then brough all 18 of us to Springer MTN to get started. You actually have to back track 1 mile up Springer to get the the starting point at the top, effectively making my mileage 8.4 miles. I felt great and was rolling, got to hawk MTN campsite around 1:30, way too early and contemplated pushing on 7 more miles to another site. I probably spent 2 hrs trying to make up my mind then figured as fast as I went I'll feel it tmw so let's just stick to the plan. This campsite is brand new and has 30 tent sites I looked at all of them as I was the first to arrive and found one I like which just so happened to be tent site #18. Set up camp and made a meal, tossed my lighter to the side and it landed in my wash bucket and it would no longer light, luckily it dried out and still works. But I made sure to carry a spare now.","Springer Mtn

JJ Don't Play,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528993,"Got up and was pretty sore as expected. Decided to start early and do a bigger day the am should at this point but it would set me up nicely for the next day which would be very tough with blood MTN and would make it easy for me to avoid having to camp in a bear canister only area. I don't carry a bear canister. I slugged on regretting the speed at which I hiked the day before. Finally making it to Lance creek around 5:30 to see it was packed. Tried to pitch on a slight incline but it didn't work my tent kept sliding when u would get in. So tired and slightly po'd I picked u everything and went in hoping to find another place. After a few hundred yards a guy eating by the trail stopped me and said there were no spots anywhere near but there was room for one more tent by him. I thanked him and gladly took him up on the offer. Shutterbug is his trail name, even saved me the trouble of hanging my bear bag and hung mine with his. I spent about 30 mins trying to find my tent stakes which ended up being right in front of me. Was a long day but thanks to some help from another hiker it was all good.","Hawk Mtn Campground

JJ Don't Play,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530698,"Well this morning started off interesting. I was camped on an old logging road on the edge of of a ridge going into a deep deep bottom. As I was packing I accidentally kicked my sleeping bag sending it rolling down. I took off after if hoping the creek in the bottom was dry. The chase exhausted me and took me a good while to get back up but all I could do was laugh at myself. I got going and my knees started hurting a bit. Finally came to Blood MTN, the climb was easier than expected. I got to the top thinking I don't know why everyone talks so bad about blood MTN. I began to understand as I began my descent, my knees really started killing me. I hobbled into Neels Gap for a resupply and to get some better insoles since my feet were also killing me. I also went a lured and got a shower which helped to revive me some. Met 2 guys from Fort Polk, one who attempted a thru hike once before and gave me some good tips and encouragement. Also met David (later to be dubbed Townie by me) and spoke with a few other guys who were headed to Bull Gap for a short day after being whipped by Blood. Got to Bull Gap and met Sprinter, Zing, Encyclopedia, Townie, and a few others. Hung my first Bear Bag that night which was an interesting ordeal just trying to find the right tree (which has gotten much easier to do). We made a fire and went to bed pretty early.Side note it has been harder than expected to find the time/wifi/service/etc to update my journal on a day by day basis. It may end up just being general updates when in tow but for know I will try to divide it out day by day then enter then all from my hand written journal/memory to here ASAP.","Lance Creek Campground

JJ Don't Play,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530704,"I got up early and took off before everyone else at the campsite. Knees killing me but I figured I would just take it slow. I got passed by almost everyone from the campsite despite starting much earlier. In pain I was happy to see Trail Magic at one of the Gaps. I caught up with Encyclopedia, Zing, Townie, and Sprinter here. They went on and I stayed at the trail magic for a while taking advantage of the ice packs. I realized I had not been taking any Vitamin I (ibuprofen) so I took two and things got a little better. They wanted to slack pack me for the remaining hills for the day but I'm stubborn and thanked them for the offer and pushed on. I eventually rolled in to Low Gap where Encyclopedia and the rest were there and said there was one spot left in the shelter and I should take it with the weather coming. Well like many I came into the AT saying I would never stay in a shelter, but when it came down to it I really didn't care that it was obviously Mice infested. I like the idea of not having to deal with a wet tent. Zing successfully thru hiked before (when he was 9!) and gave us tips about not sleeping against the wall and leaving all pockets open. I had no issues with nice. Townie forgot a protein bar and had a few droppings on his book but that was it. We did have flying squirrels come in that night which was a cool experience. I didn't sleep too well with the older couple in the shelter both sawing logs all night.","Bull Gap

I told Encyclopedia, Sprinter, Zing, and Townie I'd see then when they caught me in the next20 minutes. I started off slowly. After about 2 miles I actually began to feel really good. The rain kept me cool and I stayed dried and well ventilated wit my Precip jacket and homemade rain kilt. The Group never caught me, I trucked on through the rain and made it to my first projected stop and decided to keep going to TrayMountain Shelter. The Rain slacked and I set up in the Tent city. 30-45 minutes later the Gang rolled in Minus Townie who went into Helen for a burger. A father and son packed in mcdonalds burgers, apple pies, coke and Pepsi up to tray and handed them out then took all of our trash and headed back out for the most awesome trail magic I have experienced yet. They said they would see us in the smokies, I am looking forward to it! We all decided we would head to Top of Georgia Hostel the next day for a shower, bed, and clean clothes. Weather got nasty for a bit but the Lightheart Solong 6 held up great and kept me dry.","Low Gap Shelter

Sprinter lead the pace, which is how she got her name. We arrived at Dicks creek for 12:45 just enough time for some trail magic hotdogs. The TOG shuttle arrived and we headed to the hostel. Cleaned up and headed into town for AYCE at Daniels, Zing, et al went to Mcdonald's so I ate with Charlie Montana who I had just met at the hostel. We headed across the street for beer tasting where we met up with 2 section hikers Chewpie and Mogley and then did a quick resupply.Unfortunately TOG Hostel is alcohol free so had to get our fill there. Told Charlie how I had kicked coffee and was just using electrolyte gels,etc for caffeine. Well the resupply had a Starbucks and I had a gift card so he made sure to rag me for getting coffee. TOG was decent, it was clean but the bed's did not lend a good nights rest. It was still nice to get a shower and clean clothes.","Tray Mtn Shelter

It was pretty lacking but at least it was something, I finished off my resupply and jumped on the 8am shuttle back to the trail. We all decided to take it easy. Encyclopedia and I got to Muskrat around 3. The shelter was pretty rough but there were decent camp sites. Zing and Sprinter came in about and hour later and we setup up camp. Not long after Mogley and Chewpie came set up by us followed by Charlie Montana. We ate then walked up the trail .1 to play cards on a rock ledge and watch the sun set over Hiawasse.

The night before we all talked about how tough the profile for standing Indian looked, it ended up not being as bad as expected. I pushed on to the planned Betty Creek Campsite to see it barely had any spots, was already basically full and Encyclopedia was not there. I waited some to see if Zing and Sprinter would show and then saw a guy from our TOG stay that said Encyclopedia pushed on to Long Branch, so I decided to follow.I got to Albert Mountain and that was fun to say the least, felt like I was climbing instead of hiking for a bit. The Fire tower gave some great views. I arrived at Long Branch around 6 to see Encyclopedia, Jolly Roger and Task Master (father daughter duo we had bumped into a few times). Joked about him trying to lose us. We all agreed it was probably nice to get ahead of the bubble that was at Muskrat so we can get some better rest. We were surprised but happy to see Zing and Sprinter roll in shortly after me.The Shelter was nice and only 3 years old but I decided to tent it as I find my tent way more comfortable.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

While waiting on the $3 county shuttle we got a free shuttle from the guys at the Budget Inn. They provide free shuttle in to town for hikers even if you aren't staying at the Budget Inn which is pretty awesome. I got a burger at ""A Fork in the Road"" food truck and we grabbed a well deserved beer at Lazy Hiker. We then hit a quick resupply and headed back to the trail for 4 mile hike to Siler's Bald were Zing and Sprinter already were due to not wanting to go into town.It's a 1/2 mile hilly Blue blaze to Siler's Bald Shelter. Upon arriving I met Jem getting water who greeted me with ""Welcome tot he AT's Practical Joke"". She was spot on. The blue blaze sucked, I definitely wasn't staying in the shelter and the only tenting was a sloped field. I me Booby Trap who gave me tips on shimming my pad so I wouldn't slip all night.

I tried hanging with them a few times to find myself incredibly sore so learned it best to just meet them at the destination and hike my own hike. Sprinter and Zing are from New Hampshire and Encyclopedia is from New York so they are more used to the hills and elevation then this Louisiana Boy. They were planning on stopping 1 mile short of NOC and going in the AM. When we got to our destination we decided to just go into NOC. NOC was awesome! The Nanty was super cold, perfect for swelling feet. I got a beer and pulled pork sandwich and a shower. We all figure we should be able to find a campsite right past NOC. Unfortunately it took about 3 more miles then planned but we found a decent spot. Had to got .7 to get water for the night which wasn't too fun but we knocked out a good bit of the big climb we would have the next day.","Cold Spring Shelter

After Sassafras we ran across a dog that came right up to us. Some other hikers said he was a stray that had followed them a few days, he then decided to follow us. Zing and Sprinter got attached quickly. He was later to be named Mooch due to his A+ Yogi'ing skills. We went into Brown Fork Gap Shelter worn out and set up camp.

The group got to the Marina about 11:30 and I showed up 15-20 minutes later. We headed to the Fontana Resort. Rooms were full but I was able to split a cabin with Encyclopedia at the same hiker rate a room is! We met Ox for supper who is a friend of Zing's family who they met from there thru hike years ago. We ate at the restaurant in the Resort and I was able to get my Ribeye I had been dreaming about while hiking the last week. OX treated us all to apple cobbler with ice cream.OX maintains the trail in this area and is a wealth of knowledge. He joked how he was almost the mayor of Fontana but lost by 1 vote and he wasn't even running nor does he live in Fontana. The Current Mayor is also a Bartender at the Bar at the Resort.

They ended up going to the visitors center to call a locksmith. A guy from the visitors center came to help, Kylie said she never got a key only the beeper, well we found out the key was there. It was an a funny experience and we eventually took off into the Smokies. About 2 miles in we came across a ridge runner he told us of bear activity at the campsite we were headed to and that the 2nd shelter was closed due to bear activity. We climbed shucks tack fire tower (well Dustin and I did Kylie changed here mind after 2 flights of stairs, it was waayyy up there!). We got to the campsite and set up then had lunch. Spoke with several day hikers that were interested in my travels and one gave me 5 boiled eggs which Made for a great lunch the next day. It rained hard, I didn't get a good pitch on my tent and was getting some condensation. I had to adjust things in the middle of the night and Jy and Dustin thought I was a bear or something haha. The best part was when I ""let out some gas"" (high protein diet and hiking will do that to you) and they thought it was a bear growling.

Heard a little more about the bear at the second shelter. 2 hikers were allowed to stay there last night due to the weather even though it was closed.

She was from New Orleans, I knew we had another Louisiana hiker on our hands when I saw the Winn Dixie peanut butter. A few more came later one being Curious George. Apparently his father was at clingman's holding a photo of him and asking hikers if they had seen him. Curious George said of his dad doesn't get a spot mag he freaks out.

Got into town around 8:30am and got a big breakfast at the Smokey MTN Diner. Eggs, pancakes, ham, biscuits and gravy, hashbrowns, orange juice, and 4-5 cups of coffee. Went on to get my laundry taken care of. Next I needed to find a place to stay, didn't feel like a hostel so I decided to pay a little more and go with a motel. Got a room at Alpine Court. Not a Marriot but it is nice and clean, way better than the Budget Inn's in Franklin or Hiawassee. And the workers and really nice. Also wanted my own room with shower so I could take multiple showers haha. Going almost a week without a shower I'm sure I'll take atleast 3 before I get back on trail tmw. I went back to Smokey MTN diner to get a pulled pork plate to support the local Lions Club, at $8 for a plate lunch with cake and a drink it was a must. Hot Springs is a tiny but very nice trail town full of hikers. I have managed to get ahead of ""the bubble"" I started with and caught up to another one therefore I have seen no one in town that I have met on the trail. Kind of stinks but I'm sure I'll meet more great people as I hike on. It was nice to hike with a group but I am enjoying hiking on my own schedule and just hiking until tired rather than setting daily plans to meet up. I went to the Artisun Gallery which has art for sale from hikers and also a coffee shop. I got a coffee and when I went to pay for it the guy there said "" Your a hiker right?, when did you start?"" We chatted a bit and then he said ""Trail Magic, I got you just tell everyone about the Gallery!"". So if you are ever in Hot Springs go to the Artisun Gallery! Really awesome gesture, the trail continues to amaze me.
Side note:
I am not in any need of any support other than continued encouragement and prayers! The trail can be tough but at the end of the day I am on a extended vacation! However I have had friends/family who out of there love/care and/our living vicariously through my travels ask to help wanting to send supply boxes etc. Supply boxes can be tricky, where to send, what to send, how much to send varies a lot and you'd need to be in close contact with me to get it right which is tough to do. The easiest thing to do is donate to my balance here: 
https://www.zerodayresupply.com/donation.php?x=885&y=jordanjtemplet@gmail.com 
This way I can put the box together my self and you don't have to worry about getting it to me in time and zero day will worry about getting it to me on time. Plus Zero day breaks down things by calories so it actually allows me to put together a better more though out resupply . Again totally not necessary, this will just upgrade some Ramen meals to Mountain House.","Deer Park Mtn Shelter

I ran into some day hikers that gave me some trail mix and one commented on my dirty legs. My reply was it was actually from a few days ago. I hadn't showered in a week at that point but told them jokingly not to worry because I would finally get a shower that night. The hostel was really nice and situated over a Barn. I was looking forward to breakfast the next AM as it is often refereed to as the best breakfast on the AT. Commish and Turkey Bait rolled in around 5:30.We met a ton of other hikers who came to get out of the cold.

I was hiking a little faster so was up ahead, but missed a white blaze headed down a four wheeler trail that eventually went back to the AT.

They said they did it for their daughter and her friends and enjoyed it so much that they began doing it a couple times throughout the thru hiking season. They also volunteer with the Red Cross and were familiar with a lot of Louisiana. I also ran into another hiker heading southbound for a section hike who lived in New Iberia for a few years.

I didn't want to deal with a damp tent, hanging a bear bag in the dark, etc. So I decided to hike into town for a 32 mile day! eventually it gets dark and I have to take out my headlamp which is almost dead from accidentally turning on in my pack back multiple times.I'm not sure if you ever tried to used a light in the rain but it sucks! The light reflects of the rain and is basically useless, luckily my ""natural night vision"" was good enough to see the blazes for the most part however I I was stumbling on rocks and root so I just slowed down the pace.There were a few rock scrambles that were pretty tough to do in the dark and the rain but I survived eventually making it into town a little after 10pm.So yea I hiked my longest day (32 miles) with the last 6 hours being in the rain and the last 4 or so in the pitch dark with a basically useless headlamp.

At the rate I am right now on losing weight I would blow away in the wind by the time I reached Katahdin.My feet and knees could use a little more icing also but definitely still in good shape, but I may need to reconsider on using lighter shoes when it comes time for my next pair or start using the Superfeet insoles again.Feet are fine know but I have some concern that the continual beating (especially when I get to the extremely rocky PA) could lead to real problems over time. One thing I feel my running background has really done for me is given me the ability to know what pain is just pain and what pain is important and needs actual attention.Somethings always going to hurt while hiking the AT just like when I ran a lot, you are never 100%.

The fears may return when I get back to ""the real world"" but for now things that used to bother or freak me out don't even matter: mice, bears, snakes, heights, etc.I got to my projected camping spot that was on Guthook to seen someone beat me too it and it only had spot for 2 tents but there large 3 person tent took it all up so I kept going until I finally found a spot. I hiked in the dark for a few hours and it was tough even with fresh batteries in my headlamp to look for camping spots. I found a spot and set up but couldn't get a good pitch on my tent because there was a large rock just under the ground right where one of the stakes needed to go. I did a quick rig just to make it work then crashed for the night.","Seeley-Woodworth Shelter

I ate my breakfast and then continued on. Planning to hit Waynesboro and stay at Stanimal's Hostel before heading into the Shenadoah's! I ran into a SOBO and he told me he left a map and information of Waynesboro at the Shelter if I wanted to grab it to look at before I got there. I grabbed the map and saw there was a Residence Inn in Waynesboro! I was pumped. I still have a ton of hotel points from a few years ago working in Ohio and staying in a hotel for almost 7 months. I love Residence Inn's because every room is a suite and they are typicclly pretty nice, way nice then what a hiker can usually afford but I would be staying for free. I basically ran the remaining miles and made it to Rockfish Gap just before 1pm. I hit the food truck and got some awesome Chili Cheese Fries and then went up to the Information Center to call for a ride into town. Waynesboro has a calling list of 10-12 Trail Angels who will pick you up for a free ride into town! The first number I called the guy said no problem, be there in 15.I chatted with the man at the Visitor Center about Louisiana, he lived in Metarie for a while. He said he has lived all over working as a surveyor for Roadways but the only place he would love to move back to is Metarie/New Orleans. We talked about work and go into title issue on lands something he was very faamiliar with also and he told me about the complex heirship on 3000 acres of property nearby that is right by the AT. We both seemed to really enjoy the history of researching title and it was a great conversation.My ride arrived and said the ride was $100.00, but if I signed his guest book it was free. So I signed the book and saved $100.00.I got to the Residence Inn which is even nicer than others I have stayed at. I got a King Bed in a Studio style room with a big TV on a Swivel to face towards the bed or living room which has a recliner and sofa. Full Fridge, stove top, dish washer, etc. I am in Luxury! Walking distance from Walmart where I went for resupply, got more than I need since there are a ton of resupply options almost daily in SNP but I figured I'd get 2.5 days of healthier food so I'm not stuck with junk since that hasn't worked for me. I hit the bar at the Golden Corral and made them lose on the Buffet as my Grandpa would say. On the way back I grabbed two Yeungling Tall boys and now I am just relaxing! I'm going to get back on trail tmw for around noon and just hike however far I end up hiking. No rush, I am on pace to hit the halfway mark (the actual halfway mark not just Harper's Ferry) about 3 days before making 2 months so no worries! I am ahead of what is being called the""super bubble"" and will have plenty of time for the second half of the trail which will be more technical in some places (New Hampshire, Maine, parts of PA).I'm tempted to Zero here since my accomdations are so nice but I will save the rest of my reward points for later down the trail. I fully intend to burn them and get the best room possible at every chance I get from now to Maine! And just to say it again, Man I love hotel points haha, free town stay in luxury compared to a hostel or the normal hiker motel/hotels. Will hit the hot tub tonight after a few beers and be ready to continue slaying the AT. Last few days have been a little rough, but I think I'm getting better on food choices and this town stay has already refreshed me!","Stealth near mile 847

I ran across two does that weren't scared of anything, I probably could have petted them. Later I came to a bear sleeping on the trail and saw another laying down and eating off in the woods. I clacked my trekking pole, yelled, threw rocks, etc. and the bear would not get up. I eventually decided to just yell at him and walk towards him, he got uncomfortable once I got close and got off the trail enough for me to pass.

Hiked with Squid till the first water source which was supposed to be a waterfall but was more of a trickle, anyway it was enough for a us to tank off. I was feeling sluggish and I could tell he was too. The day was going way too slow but we came upon some trail magic of water, Cantaloupe and other goodies. I took off and started feeling sluggish again after a few hours. I got to the shelter at 19.6 were AJ and Scooter were headed and decided I would just call it quits there. The planned shelter had a great view of NYC at night but was over a half mile off trail and I was feeling reallly tired. The next day was going to suck. With New Yorks stupid rule of not allowing dispersed camping the only options were a 16 mile day or a 30 mile day. Squid and I both decided we would have to do the 30.","Wild Cat Shelter

Hiking through Bear Mountain with a ton off people and the trail side zoo slowed me down a lot but I did get ice cream and plenty of snacks all day. I stopped at a deli at 16 miles thinking I would see Squid but never did see him again. I hiked on to Fahnestock and got there after dark, unable to find the tenting area. I saw another hiker on the beach so I just did the same and set up on the beach, planning to get up early to roll out before anyone showed up.The large amount of people with no hiking etiquette and having to pass through the trail side zoo which just seemed odd to me, couple with having to hike a 30 on a day that I was not feeling up to it made this one of my least favorite days on the trail.

I planned lower mileage for the next few days to get me to Great Barrington on the 5th for a Near-0 and Zero as I near the final stretches of the AT! I felt great for the first 2 hours then tanked, but luckily there was a deli near trail which I stopped at for lunch. After a meatball sub and some coercing from thunder I felt like a new man and took off almost running to my designation, arriving at 3pm. It was early but the rain was coming and I had no need to hike further. I took a nap then decided to try to find water. I went .6 down to the road and found a little water left from trail magic and a Mtn Dew. I grabbed them and went back to the shelter. When I got to the shelter I heard someone yell my name to turn and see Sundog! I thought he was ahead of me but apparently I had passed him.

I cross into Connecticut, making New York a think of the pass and decided to stop at a country store with about 7 miles left. I ate a late lunch and was feeling a little slower and the trail got a little tougher. Sundog caught me right before the shelter. We went to the shelter and decided to eat and then hike another 7 miles to the next shelter. After eating I decided the extra mileage wasn't needed with my plans to be in GB for the 5th so I stayed and had the Shelter to myself. I told Sundog I might do a bigger day the next day and see him at Limestone Springs shelter.Mosquitos were pretty bad but I didn't want to setup my tent so I put on my head net (first time I wore it all trip) and bundled up tight in my quilt to protect the rest of my body.","Telephone Pioneers Shelter

I felt pretty good and was hiking hard. I eventually came to 3 big climbs,2 of them being Bear Mountain and Mt. Everett. This zapped a lot of my energy so I slowed down some. Bs'd with a local guy for around 20-30 minutes. He hikes the Mountain there twice a week and this was his 100+ Summit! I also saw another hiker I met a while back that commended me on how fast I was doing the trail and basically said bye I'll never see you again! Seeing him I just knew he had to had yellow blazed (hitched and skipped part of the trail) and when he came up to join conversation then saw me and wouldn't make eye contact and then left quickly I knew my assumption was likely correct. Hike you own hike and all but if you are going to yellow blaze, own up to it and don't call yourself a thru hiker (just my thoughts although many agree). He's not the first that I have encounter like this though and I'm sure he won't be the last.I crossed into Mass, crossing CT off the list and hit the 1500 mile marker leaving on 689 miles! 689 miles was my mileage for month to so the reality of the trail coming to an end is really starting to sink in. Hike on to the Hemlocks shelter which was really nice and met Spider, Chili Pepper, and El Auto. El Auto ask me if I knew anything about Toto and I was clueless. He then gave me the story of ToTo the Toyota Hubcap that was found on the PCT last year and passed off from hiker to hiker until he made it to Canada and is now being passed hiker to hiker on the AT until he makes it to Katahdin. And then he said we have Toto right here if you want to take him! I wasn't going to at first but figure why not, it'll be fun to hike with a hubcap for a day and make a good story! They rolled out to hike a little more then Hedgehog showed up and we decided to light a fire for the 4th.

Went ahead and just called a cab, figured it would save time and wouldn't cost much. Well the cab saved time but like most shuttles to/from trail it was way overpriced. Mass. doesn't allow dispersed camping so after looking at my guide I realized I would only be able to do 18 miles due to the time that I started hiking.I was feel pretty sluggish, it was a pretty warm day and I stayed up most of the previous night getting caught up on Netflix. I was tempted to stop a little short but pushed on. I saw a young bear about a mile from the campsite and watched it for a while. Coming into the campsite I heard something coming through the woods and knew it had to be a bear and would come out really close, so I got my phone ready for a picture but a soon as the bear hit the trail it saw me and bolted not giving me enough time to snap a close up.

I stopped at a Gas Station to get breakfast and more importantly caffeine. I was feeling pretty down physically, and was just hoping I could ingest enough caffeine to fix this. In the store I met Tom, a local trail angel that lets hikers camp in his yard and fill up their water. He offered to take me a town or so over to the Walmart for resupply since he was headed there anyway. Unfortunately I over supplied in Great Barrington and still had plenty of food. He gave me heads up on what was in the next town and wished me well.Got to Cheshire and was really tempted to call it a day and stop at the Church Hostel there. It had been raining most of the day, though much lighter than what I got the day before, and I was just flat out tired. Nevertheless I stopped in at the Dunkin Donuts, grabbed lunch, candy, and more caffeine and pushed on North. I finally got back to a decent hiking pace and was able to zone out and push forward. Rain picked up a little and it was starting to get a little chilly. I planned to go on to a shelter around 21 miles but had to stop at an earlier shelter to inspect the Privy.After taking care of business I went to the Shelter and saw only one other person there at the time, Walnut. It was a nice new-ish Shelter, typical Mass style with bunks and loft. I fell into the Shelter's lure and grabbed a bottom bunk. It was early, but I was cold damp and tired.

Luckily it as only about 150- maybe 200 yards and the downhill was not nearly as steep as they described, oh and the flow was great.Headed out and made it up Mount Greylock. I became a little upset with my planning, Mt. Greylock has a pretty nice Lodge that has bunks at a decent price. If I would have looked at my guide book and realized this I could have done 3 more miles for a more relaxing stay and drank a few beers in the bar. Oh well it is what it is, but that definitely would have been nice! Another day of light Rain/mist. I pushed on to North Adams, Mass. where I heard rumors of 50% off for Thru Hikers at the PaPa John's a half mile off trail! Pizza sounded great so I made the trek. I got an extra large Pepperoni Pizza and a drink for half price, they offered to fill my water bottles, and made me a makeshift table to eat on! I was astonished at how awesome their service was, even for a wet and stinky hiker.I packed the other half of the pizza and in my food bag. There was a supermarket right next door but I thought I was good on Food so I gave it a pass. I got back on trail headed north and crossed the State Line into Vermont! For around 100 miles the AT shares the Trail with the Long Trail, which is a much older trail at around 200 miles and was actually part of the inspiration for creating the AT.

I climbed the fire Tower for some of the best views on the AT, especially with the morning fog rolling through.

I stopped at the Lookout, a cabin on private land with a really cool lookout on top, the owners allow thru hikers to stay there as if it were a shelter! I was tempted but really wanted to get to Hanover ASAP. I ate there and met a few more SOBO's and section hikers. I dropped a piece of cheese and a SOBO said ""Man I'll take that cheese, I know your probably not going to eat it now"". I said nah man I'm eating that and threw it in my mouth dirt and all haha. Hiker hunger is for real. I then headed out to the next shelter, it was 20 miles or so and set me up for 26 into Hanover the next day. I felt good but didn't know if I felt up to night hiking. A few more SOBOs came in and one had down the 26 from Hanover, I decided to push on. After a few miles I heard some guys behind me that eventually kept up, it was Breakneck, I was hiking pretty quick but they passed me however we ended up hiking about the same pace. Breakneck looked familiar, turns out he started a day after me and we had bumped into each other a few times early on (like GA/NC early) but never met. HE was hiking with Cold Tater's who was somewhat of a trail Legend for my bubble. Taters had started 2 days before me. I was just pumped to run into more people hiking around my pace! I asked them where they were headed and they said HANOVER! I was like damn that's crazy, would be over 50 miles for Breakneck and 40 for Taters. We ended up stopping at the same water source and they talked me into joining in. I probably should have taken it easy given my recent episodes but I was feeling good so I figured what the hell. I always wanted to hike a 40 and this would accomplish that for me. We pushed on Bs'in and jamming to Queen and eventually some bad weather started to show up and talk began of calling it short. I had just took a 5 hour energy and was ready to go bad weather or not but we ended up calling it a night with about 32/33 miles down for me for the day. There was also the issue that if we did make it to Hanover it was going to be around 4/5am and there was no where to really stay since we would be in town on Dartmouth's campus which did not offer/allow any places to stay for thru hikers, so it probably worked out for the best.","Killington Motel

I drank my wine to celebrate my official 3 Month Trailiversary and then pitched my tent. The little box was the equivalent of 3 glasses, and I chugged it so I was feeling good to say the least. I realized I still needed to hang my bear bag. It was dark and I couldn't find any good limbs. I saw a dead tree leaning on another tree and figure it was better than nothing. I couldn't find a rock so I just used my little first aid back, with the supplies in it. Well I make a toss and it gets stuck. I cant just cut the line, I need my first aid kit so I give it a big tug and the entire dead tree falls. Luckily it didn't on me but a branch did catch me in the face leaving a scratch.

It was a pretty tough climb for me, but not quite as bad as I had anticipated. I pushed on to the shelter I had orinally planned to stopped at and met serveral SOBOs they told me the descent I had coming up was very steep, wet, and slippery and I might want to just knock it out then rather than deal with it first thing in the AM. I agreed! Shortly after Gentle Ben showed, he had took the blue blaze to the South Peak of Moosilauke to check it out. He claims it was way better than the North Peak, the North peak is too mainstream. He agreed on knocking out the descent also that evening.

The weather was getting a little nasty, and ideally I wanted to summit on a nice day. I figured I would get into the park and get an opinion from the Ranger on if I should summit or not. I hiked the ten miles in and wasn't sure exactly were to go, by the time I found the ranger and was all set it was 11:00am, the cut off time to head up Kathadin. The ranger said if I wanted clear weather it would probably be 3-4 days and that today would be better since it would be pretty cold and still cloudy/rainy the next day. He also said being a thru hiker I had more then enough time to make the hike since thru hikers usually knock it out pretty quick. So I headed up Katahdin, alone passing a few thru hikers on there way down from finishing. Once I got above tree line there were some times I felt like I was rock climbing more than anything, added with the misty rain and my worn out grip on my shoes it was pretty tough. I eventually got up to the tablelands were things smoothed out, I couldn't see but a few feet in front of me, I was in the clouds. I saw some steps going up and was like dang, climbing again. As I was almost down the fog cleared a little bit and there was the sign about 20 yards in front me of me. I can't even explain the feeling, I was struggling to keep myself together. Then I realized damn I'm the only one up here how am I going to get my summit picture! I walked up to the sign then Heard ""are you a thru hiker"" then looked to see the a family tucked away in the rocks shielding themselves from the wind and eating. They congratulated and took my pictures! They also offered me a ride to Millinocket. They were planning to take another trail down that would be much easier than the Hunt Trail (AT). Since I was now done it didn't really matter which trail I took down so I agreed, easier sounded nice. I took off and made it to the parking lot. they ended up being several hours behind me and we kind of had a fiasco because it was too late to get a hitch and their truck was 16 miles away! Eventually one of the rangers gave their daughter a ride to go grab the truck after a lecture on better planning. They kept apologizing saying this probably isn't how I wanted to end my hike and I just laughed and said I might not have gotten a ride otherwise and the chaos just kept things interesting and falls in line with the whole experience. They poured me a celebratory glass of wine and brought me to the Pamola Motor Lodge in Millinocket. IT was near 1am, so I dropped my stuff off in my room, got a shower then headed down the attached bar for a celebratory beer than crashed for the night.","ABOL Bridge

JJ Don't Play,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549389,"Following covers a the few days after the trail and my trip home:
I grabbed breakfast then checked out at around 11am and walked to McDonald's for Lunch. I then called the Hostel to see if they had space and they did. It was about 1.5 miles to the hostel but I felt like walking and had plenty time. I got to the Hostel and settled in. I was going to stay there for the night then get a ride to the Bus Station to head out to Bangor to meet my mom at the airport. I had originally thought I would summit a little later and she would already be in town and possibly rent car and meet me at Baxter State Park, but now we had a little time to spend in Maine together.A little later in the afternoon Champa, Squid, and Crazy Legs rolled in, it was good to see them again. They had got a hitch from ABOL and were waiting on better weather to Summit. A little after that came Badger and Quickstart and then Jacob a SOBO I had met in the HMW that had to head back home for a death in the family, and Gentle Ben. Quickstart, Badger, and Gentle Ben summited that day and had pretty good weather. The ranger's advice to me ended up not being correct but oh well he was going off of the current weather reports and I still had an awesome experience. A couple of us went eat supper then grabbed more food on the walk back from the Grocery store, hiker hunger was still set in. It was great to see everybody again.The Next Day I made it over to Bangor and sat at the Airport bar killing Baxter IPAs and watching a rerun of the Saints vs Patriots pre season game.Mom Arrived and it was great to see her! We got to the hotel then went out to eat an amazing meal at McLaughlin Seafood. The next day I had lunch with my buddy from college, Jay who was currently in the area. Mom and I then took a bus to Boston and got to spend a few hours there then jumped on a train to D.C. and got to take some tours. After that we jumped on the Crescent train in a sleeper car to call all the way down to New Orleans. It was a pretty awesome way to head home and add to the adventure!
Currently working on a blog. It will cover gear reviews, places I stayed out, places I ate at, as well as tell some stories in more depth then I did on here and cover whatever else I feel like putting in there.
