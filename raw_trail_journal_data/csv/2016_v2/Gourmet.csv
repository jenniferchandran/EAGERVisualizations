Gourmet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551621,"I made it to Harper's Ferry around 1830 - I'd been staying with my friend in Alexandria, VA, and was limited to the commuter schedule. There were four other hikers on the train with me - Ninja, Bad Juju, Linda, and Kenny. Ninja and Bad Juju had been friends before I met them; Linda and Kenny were individuals out on their first long-distance hikes. Ninja was by far the most experienced, vocal, and eclectic of all of us; she talked non-stop from Union Station to Harper's Ferry, teaching these two new hikers about Trail life. Disembarking at the station, she walked north for half a mile with me, got a phone call, and turned around. haven't seen any of them since. I walked six and a half miles in pouring rain and growing darkness with a guy from Kansas named Justin who's a NOBO, had chosen his trail name Al Dente just the day before, passing another guy named Wanna Chair. The rain dampened any conversation, so we just trudged along in companionable silence. There were two people sleeping on the first floor of the shelter when we showed up, plus two in the loft, and Wanna Chair and a guy named Magic showed up shortly after me. I ate trail mix for dinner and went to bed.Instead of journaling substantively today, I wrote this to commemorate a soldier of mine who recently passed: I woke up to news this morning that I could scarce comprehend: a soldier of mine had lost his life, cause undeclared.I was always conflicted about serving in the Afghan war - college wrought an idealogical transformation that put me forever at odds with the government's foreign policy - but I was never conflicted about my commitment to the wellbeing of my soldiers. It was my greatest joy to put every single one of them on a plane back to Germany at the end of the deployment, perhaps a bit roughed up, but alive and well; I didn't have to live with the terrible burden of informing a mother of her son's passing. This one thing I ardently believe: no woman ought to live to bury her son.But nature is indifferent to our beliefs.The same day that I gained my freedom, my old platoon medic lost his life. He was 21, having deployed to Afghanistan at 19 and showing us all what a man under fire can be. He was disarmingly young, baby faced even, yet despite his youth, he was a fierce soldier. When he, with a steady hand amid a cloud of acrid smoke, patched up two men who had been wounded by a detonating suicide vehicle borne improvised explosive device (VBIED), he showed us just what army training coupled with personal mettle can produce. I was proud to see him pinned his Combat Medic Badge, though the dude was so stunned by the pinning that he passed out and fell over - a comedic moment for sure. The young kid was no worse for the wear. I left my platoon leader position for a desk in an office midway through my deployment, but I never lost sight of the soldiers that my non-commissioned officers and I personally prepared for combat. I also personally laid the coordination to send them home, and as I was sifting through flight manifests, I checked every single one of my soldiers against those manifests, my mind put at ease as the list of the missing narrowed down to zero. Of course, I knew that there had been no combat casualties in my platoon; working as the chief of operations for my unit, my job was to aggregate and publish each day's significant events. I did this from the time I left my platoon until my unit left Afghanistan. I also knew that other units had borne terrible losses - a helicopter full of men went down in the mountains to the northeast of us, killing all of them; a Ranger raid to our north went bad, killing many, among them Jennifer Moreno, a friend to my friends; a lone young soldier in an anonymous uniform walked into a deserted dining facility at Kandahar Air Field, put his rifle to his throat, and pulled the trigger. All events were tragic, but none were directly personal. And yet, I grieved for all of them, for shattered youth, for dreams forever deferred.I thought we had made it back whole. I was proud of those boys, those fantastic young men who had banded together to face the most significant experience of their young lives and surmount the slow itch of sheer boredom and the the thrill of frenetic activity together. I thought that we would all remain forever connected, our lives irrevocably intertwined. But the passing of years coupled with the way that people flow in, out, and around the army wears at relationships - not that the commitment to one another fades, but the frequency of contact certainly does. Even in this era of eternal connectivity, I lost sight of Doc Nieto.And then I woke up to news of his death. There's an oft touted statistic - 22 veterans commit suicide a day. This is used as a rallying cry to do something about an epidemic raging through the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. This statistic is disputed; the majority of veterans committing suicide are over 60 years old, Vietnam vets undoubtedly in need of greater care. Iraq and Afghanistan veterans kill themselves at closer to one a day - but even one needless death is too many. I respect the motivation behind the 22 push-up challenge going around Facebook, the work to bring awareness to a blight on our nation, my brothers and sisters. I respect more the effort to tell the stories of our fallen: moments shared, memories relived. Every story is worth the telling; every life has worth; and every death is a tragedy. I don't know what Doc Nieto was going through, nor do I know the cause of his passing. One of my peers, seemingly perfectly healthy, died on a run - just fell over and was done; another died peacefully in his sleep. Weird things happen. But at such a young age for such a physically healthy young man, one cannot help but draw logical conclusions, and it hurts. It hurts that I was not there for him. It hurts to think that he suffered to such a point that he felt death preferable to life. I know this pain; I credit music, literature, family, and friends for sustaining me through some very rough times. And now, I'm pursuing my own dream, deferred no longer. Life is worth living. Dreams are worth pursuing. It's never too late to change. It's never too late to learn something new - and it's certainly never too late to reach out to somebody you haven't spoken to in years. So write an email. Send a text message. Make a phone call. They matter. God, do they matter. Just do it.","Harper's Ferry

Gourmet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551622,"Cried all night - between the storms and the snoring, I didn't sleep a wink. Devastated over the loss of Josh Nieto. I published a blog post in memory of him yesterday, and it's generating a lot of traction. I'm glad that I started this hike in shape, as I know I won't run into the two who snored so vociferously again. I hiked sixteen miles to Pine Knob shelter, mostly in solitude. Spent the better part of the day crying. Raining, of course. Got to Pine Knob to find a retired army vet there, and he was touting a whole crew of teenage JROTC types. They didn't show up for a bit - I had bathed fully before they showed up. They had a truck carrying all of their food and equipment while they hiked slick; they were wearing coordinated track pants and sweatshirts, with brand new clunky combat boots for hiking. I talked with them a little bit but was much more interested in solitude than socializing. They went to Golden Corral for dinner, but did bring back kiln dried wood to help Wanna Chair and me sustain our fire, which we lit under adverse conditions only after much tribulation - but I did eventually get my shoes dry. Fell asleep around 9.","Ed Garvey Shelter

Gourmet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551623,"Managed to sleep until about 0300, woke up to snoring. Got up around 0430 to prepare breakfast and pack, ended up helping stoke the fire. Got out of shelter around 0730, hiked until lunchtime. Met up with Gary, a Utah native and flip flop hiker, at Little Antietam Creek. He stayed on the near bank for lunch; I pressed on and dunked a foot in the river. Resigned, I decided to hike up to the Raven Rock shelter, where I found a fire tended by a veteran thru hiker, Slider. He handed me a can of black beans, a tortilla, some hot sauce, and cheese as soon as I sat down, and we got to talking. Bandied back and forth about outdoor tales while my shoes dried, then melted (but only a little). Cut the laces on them, as they were melted, and laced them up with my cord. It worked. Left with Slider's endorsement - he's certain I will succeed. I needed that trail magic... it did wonders for morale. Pressed on to Deer Lick shelter, where I was the only person for about an hour. Wanna Chair and Time Out showed up next, then a local named Angry Bird towing two other locals who'd never been exposed to the trail. Angry Bird was super Christian and wanted to talk all about it (I'm not and I don't), but Wanna Chair fielded the conversation, and they built a fire in the rain for us. Like, Wanna Chair and I thought about building a fire before the rain began, and Angry Bird wouldn't let the initiative die once it did. I did learn that I'm special.Fell asleep around 2000. 12.7 miles.","Pine Knob Shelter

Gourmet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551624,"Slept well in my shelter, woke up around six. By 0715, I was walking a back south to the road towards Walmart - a 3.5 mile walk. I got to a park a mile from Walmart and ran into Angry Bird. He picked me up, drove me to Walmart, walked with me through Walmart, and drove me back to the trail head. Only talked a little bit about the Bible - I really appreciated his kindness. Got back to the trail around 0930 and hiked to Antietam shelter, where I took a break to eat a snack and just chill. Started raining while I was there. From Facebook:Yesterday, I realized that I didn't have adequate snack foods to hike the distances I'd like to hike, so I opted to go to the Walmart 3 miles from my campsite in the morning.Today, I stepped off around 0715 to walk to Walmart. I'd walked most of the way, when a local who'd stayed at my site with me picked me up, took me to Walmart, and dropped me back off at the trail head, saving me 4 miles of road walking. The weather was at least not raining for the first two miles of my hike. Then, it began raining. Testing my hypothesis that I don't actually need rain gear, I walked without it. I walked over a mountain and into the next valley, slowly becoming saturated. By the time I had reached the next shelter, my right IT band was aching and I was near hypothermic. I walked the .3 miles off the main trail to the shelter, shivering. Lo and behold, some trail angel had stacked dry firewood under one of the shelters. I couldn't have imagined a more welcome sight.Today I learned:1) Everything I packed has a purpose. I'm wearing merino wool leggings right now; I'd thought about sending them home yesterday.2) Provided it's just a little bit warmer, I can totally hike through the rain with no change to my dry weather attire. 3) My pack and gear are awesome. Everything in my bag was dry. La di da do everything. 4) The AT is full of trail angels, and they make such a big difference. After several hours in my shelter, I have turned it into paradise. Put up my poncho to keep the cold air out - it raised the temperature a solid ten degrees. People are crowding in. Had a really good conversation with one kid who's worked for the DOD - told him I was calling in to Nieto's funeral; he told me that his brother, a Marine, had hanged himself. So devastating, the human toll of suicide. His stepmother, nearly a year later, is almost suicidal herself with the grief. Lots of political talk. His name is Dandelion Dan; his fiancée is Sunflower Samurai.Skype at 1900 - Nieto's funeral. My blog post In Memoriam has been viewed 1800 times, including by COL Eric Smith, who wrote me and friended me on Facebook. The world is crazy.","Deer Lick Shelter

Gourmet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551625,"The sun furtively came out in the AM, so I pulled my ass out of bed, packed up, and was out on the trail around 0845. Spent a leisurely morning talking two a former Marine who was hiking with his Army vet buddy in full military regalia - all the issues shit, plus a shotgun. Certainly entertaining. He recommended I look up Dr. Jack Kevorkian’s jazz album, A Very Still Life. Hmmm. Wore my rain jacket for about the first half hour. Took it off and stretched... Lots of stretching today. Very diverse terrain, diverse characters too. Spent a good stretch hiking with Chip, a 52-year-old electrical waste recycling manager for the DOD in New England - talked lots of foreign policy, life, aspirations. I left him at Birch Run shelter and pushed on. Quarry Gap and Birch Run shelters are gorgeous, by the way. Six and a half from Birch Run to Toms Run - good easy miles through sandy scrub pine forest. Joined Johnny Cash at the shelter - a philosophical 22-year-old from New Jersey on a soul searching quest. He's carrying a Canon camera but is carrying maybe 20 pounds. Amazing. Talked with him all evening - really good guy. I encouraged him to dream big, do big. Go west, pursue your passion. He had been studying fashion advertising in college and dropped out after he learned the dark side. Said he was experiencing his quarter life crisis. So young!Bed by 2000, Toms Run shelter, 19 miles.","Rocky Mountain Shelter

Gourmet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551636,"Sluggish morning, up and out by 0730. Backtracked just a bit to pick up the Sunset Rock trail - 2.5-mile loop that links up with the AT at a negligible distance increase. It was otally worth it - lots of beautiful rock formations, great stuff... I got a cool pic with Little Lego Loc. I was feeling sluggish, so I pulled up to the Pine Grove Furnace general store two miles down the road, plugged in my phone, and sat on the porch, waiting for 1100, when the place opens. I soon figured out that it actually opens at 0800 on Sundays, and thus was open. I got myself an enormous AT Hiker burger and a huge boat of fries, not believing that I was quite up to the challenge just yet. I opted to skip the half gallon challenge altogether - day 6? Madness. A bunch of NOBO types showed up, and I talked with them a bit. One of them was an 18-year-old kid wearing combat boots, which he'd been wearing since Springer. I left the general store around 1215 and started walking, stopped again when I found another outlet at the park/s shower building and charged until 1300 - I crushed that food and was in a pleasant food coma. I hiked from 1300-1515, covered the mileage to the next shelter, James Fry. There was just one older man here and I talked with him a bit. He's retired and loves to talk, so I entertained him. The crew from the general store trickled in. Talked with them a bit - they're pretty good people - Seal Tree, Doc Trails, Portage, White Rabbit, Frost, and Rain Man. I did pull-ups on the rafters of the shelter after dinner and totally shamed all of these college athletes - they're 1,000 miles in and trail skinny. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna have fun being an ultra healthy hardcore freak on the trail with no hip belt (it's in Germany) - I like being different; it gets noticed. Tomorrow, I'm doing 26 miles across the Cumberland Valley with this crew - it's that, or stay in town, and I'm not staying in town.","Toms Run Shelter

Gourmet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551637,"I woke up at 0100 and couldn't go back to sleep. I swear I'm developing insomnia here. I tried to go back to sleep but only dozed fitfully. I woke up for real again at 0500 and up when an alarm went off at 0600. I stepped by about 0730.The Trail today was nice. The first section was quite flat, then an extensive boulder hopping portion that was super fun to jump around on. I got to the signage directing people around, and took the blue blaze trail out to White Rock - great views. I returned to the trail and hiked up to the old AT midpoint (cool sign), then down and into the Cumberland Valley. That valley is huge, replete with lots of corn fields. I was kind of annoyed by all of the seemingly unnecessary detours through farmland - I was starting to hurt. I got into Boiling Springs and met up with the crew, who had stopped for lunch. I ended up picking up some HEET and some Tylenol PM from the convenience store, then went to the ATC building and charged my phone. I left for Darlington shelter - a 13 mile walk - around 1315. I listened to Hamilton the whole time - it's my power music. Walking rapidly became just painful halfway through this stretch. I guess I took the first 20 miles way too aggressively. The last 6 were hell. So many aches and pains - Achilles Tendon, tendon atop the foot, IT band, knees... so much pain. And then the last mile was up a mountain. I pushed through in significant pain and got to the shelter in time to grab floor space - I daresay that climb was a trail of tears. I shook it off, settled in and took my sweet time going through the motions. A guy showed up with trail magic while I was cooking- cookies, a few sodas, and Dixie cups. He had lots of local trail knowledge too. He was a super friendly guy and he offered to drive us around tomorrow too. At his advice, I booked a room at a the Red Roof Inn in New Buffalo to recover... I'm taking my time sweet time tomorrow too, and chilling in Duncannon against Slider's advice - supposedly, it's a hiker vortex. I'm in too much pain, and I want to write, plus the hotel has free wifi and I can charge all my shit. Oh, and shower and sleep well. So uh... James Fry to Darlington Shelter, 26.3 miles. First trail marathon. Last for a good while.","James Fry Shelter
",Darlington Shelter,"May 09, Mon",26.30
Gourmet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551639,"I woke up to a stunningly beautiful sunrise at Darlington Shelter - compensation for that climb. I got up, pulled the plug on my air mattress, pissed, came back to the shelter, blew my air mattress back up, and got back into my bag. I really walked against my better judgment; I should have taken a zero right there. Alas, peer pressure has a say. Instead, I walked down off the mountain, then through a beautiful valley, then back up into and over a mountain (very rocky - hurt myself here), before I reached Hawk Rock overlooking Duncannon. I kinda flip flopped with White Rabbit for a bit, though she ultimately passed me. At Hawk Rock, I met a couple hiking south, as well as a local writer. I talked writing with the writer for a bit, then we split ways. One of my aspirations is to publish, so I enjoyed that conversation a good bit. Getting down to Duncannon was a bitch. The trail consisted of lots of stone steps - my vision of hell at the moment - leading down to flat stony pathways, then more stone steps. Worst of all was the routing of the AT up the side of the mountain when there was a perfectly good trail continuing down... but I took it because I'm a stubborn purist. I eventually got to the Doyle, saw Doc Trails, Rain Man, etc, and explained what happened. I stuck around for a meal, picked up my resupply package from the post office, then called my hotel to pick me up ($10 pick up and drop off). The Red Carpet Inn is probably 300 meters from a Burger King; I walked 900 meters along the highway in my compromised state to go to Lumberjack Kitchen (and not eat at Burger King). I ordered a steak with green beans and sweet potato fries and promptly ate it all. I walked back, watched a few videos, poured the morning's grains into my newly liberated peanut butter jar with some water, then went to bed. Though I'm sensitive to irregular noise at night, I didn't even care about the highway noise - a real bed!","Darlington Shelter

Gourmet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551696,"I woke up around six - awesome sleep. My ody was still sore, and I lounged a good bit. I even turned on the heat. I wasn't doing much until the owner came by to ask when I wanted a ride into town, then I noticed my beanie cap was missing. I called Lumberjack to confirm my cap was there, walked to Lumberjack to pick it up, picked up my hat, then walked back. That bum knee is still painful. I got a lift to the CVS at 1030. While there, I picked up Tylenol, Tylenol PM, ibuprofen, and ear plugs - I'm moving into the Doyle today. I walked across the plaza to the grocery store in search of my favored chocolate (Germany has spoiled me). I searched high and low for Ritter Sport but came up empty handed. I did pick up some CIBs, some jerky, chocolate milk, an apple, Fritos, Ghiaradelli chocolate - sea salt and almond: SEA SALT in big bold letters. Walked outside to start walking to the Doyle, got offered a ride as soon as I'd hit the pavement, took it. The guy, Dosu Kinuta, hiked the AT last year and was heading down to Damascus for Trail Days. He took me to the Doyle, and we both drank a beer before he continued on. We're now Facebook friends so he can track my movement and hook me up in Maine - sweet. I checked into the Doyle then went to the post office to pick up my shirt - I'd ordered a long sleeve thing as part of my sun survival plan (no sunscreen!). Nothing. I'll go tomorrow. On the way back, I stopped by the pizza place and ordered a medium ham and pineapple. It was huge, and I ate it all. I walked back to the Doyle and took a nap. Tried the SEA SALT chocolate. Not even a hint of sea salt. Suppose I'll try another square. FaceTime with my boo - he got his Apple Watch today. Love my hubby, such a kind soul. Trying to find things to keep me sane while I heal. Reading The Lord of the Rings. Went down to the bar around 7 for dinner, met up with Chip and Backbone - a bunch of veteran hikers there en route to Damascus for Trail Days too. Caught up with Amy, Elliott, Ben, and Mike over the course of the evening, also watched a trail documentary of the CDT that Jester, a Triple Crowner, had made - pretty awesome. They had homemade cookies and everything, and these guys went out of their way to make me feel welcome. It was so refreshing, bum knee and all.","Duncannon

Gourmet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551753,"I woke up with no knee pain and showered and carried my pack downstairs in anticipation of resuming my hike today. I ate breakfast at Goodie's, during which time my knee acted up again. I took an ibuprofen 800 with breakfast (yay army), then walked to the post office with my pack on. Pain. I picked up the shirt that I'd ordered two days hence and walked back to the Doyle to wait for the doors to open so I could check in for another night. I was doing some stretches for my knee when Backbone came down and said hello. Shortly thereafter, Sooner or Later, a wild child minister from New Hampshire showed up, and he and I talked all of this prepper stuff until the bar opened at 1100. He's got a homestead up in northern New Hampshire that I'd just love to see. I lounged around until 1600 waiting for a ride up to Rite Aid for a brace for my knee - the road up the store does not accommodate but the most daring pedestrians. I started reading The Fellowship of the Ring with my leg up on a chair. Precious One, a flip-flop hiker wearing an I Love Jesus hat (triggered my heeby-jeebies, it did), helped assess my knee and treat it by massaging rubbing alcohol into the inflamed area - that worked wonders. She recommended that I pick up and intermittently wear a knee brace. Meanwhile, a bunch of clowns at the bar tried to give me a trail name - Lego (because of Little Loc), Flame (because I'm a gay ginger), FedEx (because I'm a professional logistician). None stuck. Chip bought me a beer and also suggested that I take the blue blaze route out of town, as it is smoother than the AT - I really appreciated that, though I'm a purist at heart and disinclined to detours of convenience. I downloaded three episodes of Band of Brothers on Amazon and watched the first at bedtime. I fell asleep around 2200 - I will be pressing forward tomorrow, this vortex be damned.","Duncannon

Gourmet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551754,"I woke up around 0630 and was out by 0730. I hiked to the first shelter out of town and up a hill, Clark's Ferry, where I met Toast and Dill, two thru-hikers. I talked with them while I ate a snack and stretched, then pushed on. I reached the parking lot for Peter's Mountain around 1100 and started in on the miles to that shelter. It began to rain. It began to rain hard. I booked the miles to the viewpoint, which is a mile from the shelter. The rain stopped, dissipating as quickly as it arrived. Thoroughly saturated, I was having flashbacks to last week - I thought about pitching my tarp over the face of the shelter and huddling for the night. The thought of descending three hundred stone steps to reach the spring dissuaded me from any further consideration. It urns out that the shelter had been recently torched, and an AT volunteer was there with a camera to document the damages when I showed up. We got to talking, and I had lunch. He, Jeff, had built the shelter and its beautiful stone steps to water (that I never saw). He was visibly distraught by the wanton arson that had damaged the shelter and asked if I knew anything about the hiker who had put out the flames; I did not. Toast and Dill showed up. We all talked, piecing together bits of the story on the sooty floor. I left around 1315, aiming to make it to the next shelter, 17 miles away (I had already done 11 - knee be fine). I ended up doing 25 miles today, pulling just short of the next shelter. Joy of joys, the sun came out and dried all of my clothes as I walked. Hiking with the brace felt fine too. As the afternoon progressed, I began to suspect dehydration, as I was a bit sluggish around 1700. I ate a Clif bar and drank some water then, rejuvenated, pushed on. I arrived at my campsite, an old mining settlement, around 1900, and set up my tarp for the first time. I threw my bear bag up using the jumble of hemp cord in the trail register box and prepared dinner. As I was beginning to eat dinner in the failing light, a military vet showed up with his poncho over his pack, secured with an orange PT belt. It was ODB! I'd been looking for him for a few days. I caught up with him over dinner - good dude. Water was an issue today - sparse - so I carried an extra 2L for the last 4 miles of my hike. It was worth it. I think I'm still dehydrated. I've got a liter and a half for tomorrow morning, which is adequate to carry me to the next source. Tomorrow, I'm doing 22 miles to make it to the 501 shelter. Solar shower. Mmm.","Duncannon

Gourmet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551755,"I didn't sleep too well last night - lots of things woke me up, including the fob light on my down jacket (pillow). I got moving around eight and made it to the Rausch Gap shelter around ten, enjoying the easy terrain. I filled up on water (so clear, so nice) then moved on. I reached the base of the climb up to Penn Shelter, which sits on the northern edge of an imposing ridge, around 1230 and stopped for lunch and to air out my feet. Expecting a thunderstorm, I got moving quickly, resuming my hike at 1300. I ran into trail angels at a parking lot just prior to my climb and got a Gatorade, which doubled my liquid supply for the coming 7.5 miles to Penn shelter - yesss. Believing the weather man's claims of impending doom, I raced my happy ass up and across that mountain. Before I knew it, I'd reached the ridge line and started booking it across. Somewhere along the way, I think I lost Little Lego Loc - he fell out of my hat. I also lost a bottle of HEET today, which is slightly devastating. I'll cope. Midway across the mountain, my energy died, then the rock fields came. I was hustling against a coming storm... ugh. The ocks slowed me way down, and I got to Penn Shelter around 1550, ready to keel over. Toast and Dill were there, and we all talked about how broken we were - Dill, back on the floor and feet up the wall screaming 'everything hurts and I'm dying!' We then started talking about the 501 shelter and pizza four miles hence relative to the unreliable water supply that would be a .4 mile round trip - fuck that. We rallied and decided to make a move for 501, each of us pulling out headphones to use music to power through. ALEXANDER HAMILTON!The hike down to 501 was largely on a dirt road - very nice. Validated our decision. I got here around 1745, after navigating one last rock field. Thank you, PA. Inside, I found Backbone, Sooner or Later, and a handful of other hikers chowing down on some pizza - Backbone had a piece at the ready to pass to me when I walked in the door (yay friends!). Oh, the forecast changed to 40% chance of rain at 1600 and 0% chance at 1800. ... but a storm rolled in with fervor just five minutes before we'd been told to go out to meet our pizza delivery guy, and Toast, Dill, and I spent ten minutes huddling under a pine tree in the pouring rain waiting for that damn car. The pizza was good though; I ate five pieces. Thoroughly sated, I pulled out my food bag and laid its contents out on the table - I'm finding that there are certain things in my pantry that I just won't eat, and that's extra weight, so it's weight that I'm shucking here. Backbone, seeing my dried goods and bagged grained and legumes all lined up in neat rows, had an epiphany and bestowed upon me a trail name that I quite like: Gourmet. He says it's either that or Fancy Feast. I'll nod to my European inclinations. I'm gonna go just 16 miles on average over the coming days to give my body a chance to heal (and allow the postal system to work its magic). I'm still working on my trail legs too, so it'll serve to help me get acclimatized and such. I've done 47 miles over the past two days coming out of an injury. There's really no reason for such a robust pace. I took meds three times today. So I'm gonna linger around here tomorrow morning, charge my external battery, and have a nice breakfast of cold pizza. The world can wait.","Yellow Springs Campsite
