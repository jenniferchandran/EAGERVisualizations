Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536550,"Hopefully this will be the time to successfully complete my section hike of the Appalachian Trail. I will begin at Rangeley, ME and head north! Best news of all is that my hiking buddy Landcruiser will be hiking with me. Our plan is to start hiking Tuesday, June 28. Landcruiser has already completed the AT so her knowledge will be helpful and her support is priceless. Completion will be my biggest celebration for turning 70. When I first started backpacking on the AT, I did not have the goal of completing the whole trail. However as I continued to mark off the miles it became rather obvious that to stop short would be not acceptable. Victory is in sight.","

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536549,"I am having to do my preparations early for a June 28 ""start hiking"" date. I am leaving home on June 8 and will not be back until after my AT hike is complete. I will be in NJ, VA, Tucson, and back in VA before I fly to Maine. It is a logistic nightmare but I think I'm getting things figured out. Basically I will be spending time in NJ with our oldest daughter and family. Nothing is more important than family and it's been a long time since we were together at Christmas. Then I will go to VA to get Claire, a granddaughter who is having her turn with Granny and Poppa for an Intergenerational Roads Scholar trip to the White Stallion Ranch in Tuscon. THEN, I get to try to finish the Appalachian Trail. I guess that means I am a Luckydog - family and grandkid time then backpacking. Life is good! (Especially if I get to the trail with nothing essential forgotten :-)","

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547795,"Up at 4 AM to get to the airport to fly to Portland. Life has been so crazy. On June 8 I flew to NJ and hiked 3 days in PA with my son-in-law, John. Then I spent time with my oldest daughter and family. Took train to VA to pick up granddaughter and flew with her to meet husband in Tucson for a Roads Scholar Intergenerational trip (Dude ranch in Tucson). Flew back to VA with granddaughter and now to ME to meet Landcruiser and finish the AT. Whew! Landcruiser and I were met at the airport by Donna and Cindy, friends of Landcruiser (Debbie). Went to lunch then they took us to the trail - ME 4 at Rangeley.
The prediction is for rain tomorrow and we had planned to tent camp. Decided to go into shelter tonight and hopefully make it to the next shelter and avoid wet tents. We started hiking at 5 pm but it was a short hike to the shelter.
Huge number of people at the shelter and at the campsites. There are two organized boys and girls camp plus AT hikers. Found room in the shelter and enjoyed meeting others. Super glad to see Debbie and to have this journey underway. Tomorrow will be hard but we can do it!","

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547797,"Started day at 6:30 AM after sleeping soundly. Nice guys in the shelter and no big snorers (unless it was me and that of course was no problem for me). It is light really early - there was light at 4:30 AM.
Started hiking and passed 2 small ponds then came to Eddy Pond. Very pretty. Took nice break then started long hard climb up Saddleback Mtn. Lots of boulders. It was better for me when we got above tree line. Beautiful views and nice to see where I am heading. Rocky and tough descent then had a hard climb up The Horn. There was a rebar ladder for which I am grateful. Then another tough descent was required. New England's trail tread is a challenge. It is not ""walking"" but scrambling. Refilled out water at Reddington Stream Campsite. Water was a long way from trail and the campsite was very wild and not user friendly. Very over-grown and unkempt. We were both pooped and had a long pow-wow over whether to camp here or solder on over Saddleback Jr. Rain is predicted so....on we plodded. We climbed then seemed to be on a ridge with lots of up and downing. Boulders, smooth granite slopes and rocks. We were very slow but persisted and made it. It took us 10 1/2 hours to go 8.9 miles but we did what was a very difficult hike on day one.
Only one person in the shelter when we arrived. Shelter is not the best but it feels awfully good to be here.","Piazza Rock Lean To

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547799,"Started raining during the night. Debbie slept in (very good since she is a terrible sleeper). Left shelter at 8:30 and rain had stopped. First part of the hike involved descent of very rocky trail. We were very slow to Oberton Spring. The sky cleared and it was a lovely morning. Debbie is complaining of very tight quads. My calf muscles are quite tight. Maybe they are feeling abused.
Steep climb out of Oberton Stream then a more gradual climb. Hike along a the stream with waterfalls, gorges - really special. Long climb up Long Mountain but the trail was much more friendly. Steep climb for about the last 1/2 miles. The last 2 1/2 mile to the shelter was great but unfortunately it started pouring rain. Boots and clothes are wet. Is this long distance hiking or what! :-)
Space in the shelter again with very nice people. We are meeting both north and south bound hikers. Privy is down the hill from the shelter and coming back I fell and really whacked my Left knee cap on a rock. Hope there is no long term price to pay. Debbie fell twice today - both times landed on her bottom. My first fall. I'm sure it won't be my last. 
Big question - do we go 6.2 miles tomorrow or 13.5 and get us to Stratton. A few years ago, the answer would be a no brainer. I do feel much slower now but I am out here!","Poplar Ridge Lean To

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547800,"Discovered that the upside down U shaped frame of my ULA Ohm backpack is broken. It is not carrying too badly but will need to get it fixed. Had good signal today on phone and called ULA. They are shipping the part to Caratunk.
Did steady climb this AM up Spaulding Mtn. Trail not bad at all. Then had some distance on the ridge upping and downing. Had a 2 mile descent that was quite steep and quite rocky. It wasn't death defying, though, so I'm grateful. Descent ended at the So. Branch of the Carrabassett River. Very beautiful and was able to rock hop so didn't have to ford. 
We had a 1 1/2 mile climb up Crocker Mtn to camp site. I really wanted to go on to Stratton but we are moving so slowly. It would have been 7.3 miles more with about 1500 ft gain. Just didn't seem wise. We had time to spread out gear and get it dry. Creek was near our tents so we could clean up.
Turning in early tonight so we can get an early start. Hopefull will have a nero day in Stratton - be there by noon or 1PM at the latest. Shower, clean clothes, and real food: will be AWESOME","Spaulding Mountain Lean To

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547801,"Last night we cleaned up in the creek at Crocker Cirque Campsite. We dried out all our gear from the rain. The campsite was very nice and it was a relaxing enjoyable afternoon/evening. Was in the tent by 7:30 - relaxed, wrote in the journal then slept until 5 AM. Two sets of hikers arrived after dark. Not my cup of tea. 
Started hiking at 6 AM. Steep, steep climb up first half of Crocker Mtn. Last half of the climb was more gradual. We were slow but steady. Hope we are getting stronger. The descent then ascent of North Crocker had a rocky but not scary trail. Lots of slabs of granite. Had 5.2 mies of descentwith varied trail tread. We worked at being faster and made much better time. Actually a little better than 1 mph. (I mention this because much of the AT that we've hiked we average about 2 mph. It bugs me to be so dang slow).
Tired but not exhausted as we took the shuttle to the hotel. Shower and real food were as awesome as I knew they would be. Laundry done. Sort of dreading tomorrow. Have long steep climb and work over the Bigelows. Hope we do better than I am expecting.","Crocker Cirque Campsite

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547813,"Slept well. Really no place for breakfast except for gas station / general store. Arranged for Stratton Motel people to pick us up there by 7 AM. After we walked to the general store we found the door locked. Opens at 7 AM on weekends! As we're deciding what to do the woman who was the morning employee said she would fix us a bkfst sandwich and snuck us in the back door! Trail magic that was very, very much appreciated. 
Was on the trail by 7 AM. I did so much better today. Initially was a slow drudge climb; very hot; dripping sweat; then entered an area of huge small house size boulders that were all covered with thick green moss. It was incredibly mysterious and beautiful. Some switch went on in my head and I quit focusing on how hard it was and was able to capture the beauty of the journey. Big, big mind set change for me.
Long hard climb and had some views but then wind began to blow and clouds moved in. Made it to top and took picture. It sleeted on us. The wind was so hard that it was difficult to manage hiking sticks. Had to be at least 40 mph. Took summit picture then started down. Steep descent but not too far to campsite. Very confusing place. Had tent platforms and privy a long, long way from everything. Water source not well marked. Starting to drizzle. Couldn't fit 2 tents on platform so we tented behind a caretaker's deserted cabin. Windy and cold. Debbie slept cold but I did OK. Tent wasn't really level but I managed.
Great day on the trail. Frustrating evening at campsite. Felt really good to lie down and relax.","ME 27 - Stratton

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547820,"We had intended to go a couple more miles but we had a change of plans We went to bed so early last night that we were hiking by 6 AM. We had a steep climb up Avery Peak. It was absolutely stunning. Sun was shining and the views were spectacular. It is a very pretty mountain. We spent time on the summit. The descent was a long one. Little Bigelow was an interesting climb. Steep then some more gradual. Was along the ridge with tons of up and down. Again a long descent and at time pretty steep.
It would have been a 15 mile day to Pierce Pond. Decided to be nice to ourselves and do a shorter day. It will add an extra day but we had planned to give ourselves the flexibility to do that. I think it was a great decision and I think Debbie agrees. Her feet are burning and really hurting her. Wish I could help.
Huge group at shelter. Initial group very considerate of others. Later several people showed up who tented but show stayed up late. I slept soundly but I know they bothered Debbie. Debbie also reported rain during the night.","Avery Memorial Campsite
",Little Bigelow Lean To,"Jul 03, Sun",7.20
Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547821,"On the trail at 6:30. Beautiful morning with the sun shining through the trees. Today we had a lot of relatively smooth trail. Had two climbs but they were gradual and very doable. The trail has it rocky, rooty, and muddy moments but this is Maine. One cannot expect otherwise.
We were at the shelter early. Wanted to go on but did not really want to go to Pierce Pond 10 miles away. None of our book or maps gave any indication of any possible camping sites before then. Decided to just chill out at this beautiful pond and easily get to Pierce Pond tomorrow to get ready to ferry across the Kennebec the following day.
Nice shelter on the pond. Debbie swam out and into the lake. She is tough. I jumped in up to my neck and jumped right back out. It was COLD but very refreshing. Pretty windy. Spent over an hour just watching the waves, the puffy clouds- enjoying the peacefulness of the moment. I call it ""living a prayer"".
Met a South Bound hiker who is an Iraqi war vet who is fighting PTSD. Was interesting to talk with him and I surely wish him the healing he is looking for. Have met many friendly/interesting hikers on this trip.
Mother and three children came into the shelter. She is carrying heave load. Youngest son is 6 or 7. One son is 13 and daughter who is 16. Very interesting and pleasant family. Live in Cincinnati but mother is French","Little Bigelow Lean To

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547822,"On trail at 6:15. Had a rather restless night as it was too hot in the sleeping bag. Shelter was very full.
There was a lot of relatively smooth trail today which both Debbie and I enjoyed to the max. Made great time. Feeling pretty strong but truthfully, the trail was much easier that what we had earlier in this hike.
Huge group of males - all southbounders - at the shelter when we arrived. Appeared to have been drinking and just hanging out. Seemed pretty purposeless. Wonder if they will get very far on the trail. They finally moved out and another temporary group came for lunch and a swim.
Debbie and I walked to Harrison Pierce Pond Camp, a traditional Maine sporting camp. Met the man who has run it for 31 years. Very interesting to learn about the camp. In talking with him, he shared the awfulness of being one of the ones who found a young hiker 2 years ago who drowned in Pierce Pond from cramping up. The hiker was a northbounder; very healthy. Hard to think about. We'll have his famous hiker breakfast pancakes tomorrow morning. We will then catch the ferry to cross the Kennebec River sometime between 9 and 11 AM.
Debbie and I swam in the pond and it felt great. The young family was in the shelter. Also met two women section hikers. One seemed quite driven and the other laid back. They will have completed in hike in 3 sections. Impressive.","West Carry Pond Lean To

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547824,"Hard night in the shelter. Too hot to be in the sleeping bag and the mosquitoes were ferocious. Especially bad in the dusk and at the dawn. Had head net but it was only marginally helpful. Tenting would definitely be a better option. Woke early and went to the Harrison Camp. He graciously let us in and we had relief from the mosquitoes. Breakfast was wonderful. Great pancakes with blue berries, raspberries, eggs and sausage. Heavenly.
Hiked to the Kennebec River then got in line to be ferried across in the canoe that is the official route of the AT. Enjoyed a young boy of about 8 who was the son of the canoe operator. He was having us sign papers and was really cute as he took his job seriously. Waited almost as hour as only 2 hikers at a time could cross. Glad for shade. 
Picked up by the Sterling Inn. Owners were quite accommodating. Took us to the Brewery & Grill for lunch. Did laundry. Enjoyed a lazy afternoon. Caught up on email; organized resupply. Good day.","Pierce Pond Lean To

Got that fixed and started hiking. Trail was great for about 6 miles. Had steep climb up Pleasant Mtn then descent. Had up Middle Mountain. Rain started during climb. Rock and roots very steep and very slick. Really slowed the pace.   I felt strong. Long, long descent over slick rocks. Debbie had a fall. Started to rain again at Moxie Pond (3 more miles to the shelter) Debbie fell trying to rock hop over the spill way of the pond. Very treacherous. She said ""I'll never make this"" then down she went. Everything got wet. She was essentially on her back struggling to get up. I was on slick rocks and was unable to be of assistance. what a mess. She had water collected in her pack cover which had to be dumped. Fell again before we reached the shelter.
Got to the shelter a little before 5 PM. They made room for us. Everything wet. Going to bed!","US 201, Caratunk

Everything wet - shoes, socks, clothes, etc. No rain this morning but vegetation wet. Steady climb for 2 miles. At summit had bad weather bypass which we took. Afraid of very slippery rocks. (Found out later that of the two women we met at Pierce Pond, one of them had fallen and broken her arm hiking this section in the rain).
Able to maintain a steady pace. Trail pretty good in lots of places. Forded the Piscataquis River. It was about knee deep. Trail after the river consisted of many ups and downs as we went along the river. Both of us were feeling weary. Last mile of the day seemed way too long. Got to shelter before 3 PM with NO RAIN. Had shelter to ourselves until about 6:30. Shared shelter with middle aged male flip flop hiker and a couple of young people who were out for 4 days. Obviously new backpakers with huge, huge packs. Also had a ridge runner who was NOT helpful and who smoked a pipe in and around the shelter. She was especially not helpful to the inexperienced hikers.
Chilly tonight but mosquitoes out in force. Very excited about getting to Monson tomorrow. To me it represents the beginning of the end of my hike. Also we will take a zero day to rest up and make final plans. I also need to buy my plane ticket home. Have delayed as long as possible trying to maintain flexibility.

Really strange. Up and on the trail at 6:15. Supposed to rain but really just misty and overcast. Debbie set a fast pace and we were at our first ford of the Piscataquis River in less than an hour. Water only knee deep so ford was no issue Periodic light rain bu we just kept hoofing it.
My pack stay poked through the pack. I cannot believe the pack issues I am having. Really doesn't seem to impact the way my load is carried so that is good. We really didn't even stop to take breaks. Stopped to make call to make reservations. To trailhead at ME 15 before noon. Lodge picked us up and in 15 minutes we were having a beer and fantastic lunch. Must be heaven
Lodge is an old house. We are in a tiny room with a sloped ceiling on the 3rd floor. Owner is very nice. Shower and laundry are awesome as always. The lodge has ""hiker clothes"" so I can wash everything I own. You have no idea how nice that is.
Enjoyed a quiet afternoon. Stuff everywhere. Tomorrow will be a day of organizing and planning. Lots to think through. Also need to buy plane ticket home. Enjoyed talking to Mike. Will be fantastic to sleep without mosquitoes.","Horseshoe Canyon Lean To

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547872,"No miles today. Hung out at the Lakeshore Inn and Pub. Had a massage which felt mighty fine. Joints feel very stiff and I think the rest is very important for my body. It is very rainy today so it felt doubly good that this is a rest day. Tried to organize food to carry and food to give to the shuttle for Jo Mary Rd. I think Debbie would really like to just carry the extra food. I am not in favor of that at all. The extra weight is pretty significant. 
Spent a lot of the day with Trish, the section hiker whose hiking partner broke her arm. Delightful company. She is going to finish the hike with the family from Cincinnati. I know she will enjoy the more reasonable pace.
Great food at the Pub here and it has been good to have some of the nice things of civilization. I am excited about doing the last of the trail. Sort of hard to believe that I am almost done!","ME 15, Monson

Sign re the 100 Mile Wilderness is rather sobering but hey, let's go Beautiful day full of sunshine and quite crisp. The trail was absolutely beautiful with 4 or 5 ponds that were so serene. Several places were covered with that thick green moss that looks so magical. Did numerous ups and downs. Trail tread pretty arduous - very rooty with lots of rocks and mud. Forded two streams. Wilson Stream Falls was very spectacular. Met lots of people on the trail.
Had thought we might go on 4.7 miles to the next shelter. Decided that we would stay here. Hopefully will get an early start in the AM to climb the mountains. Sharing the trail with French Flying Pig (Stephanie)and her 3 children. Trish (Lady Bird) has joined them. Very enjoyable evening with great company.

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547876,"Left shelter at 6 AM. It was a hard day especially for Debbie. She was worried from the beginning and complained of not feel well - afraid of how hard the day would be. I felt strong but certainly have been in her shoes before so tried to just let her lead and do whatever would be helpful to her. 
The 4.7 miles we thought about doing yesterday was hard with lots of up and downing, rooty and rocky, and definitely slow going. We then climbed Barren Mtn, then 4th Mountain, then 3rd Mountain (also called Monument Cliff). The trail was beautiful with lots of rain forest type moss. 
We were very slow. At last we came to West Chairback Pond Side Trail and there was a large group of young women camped with many tents. We were able to find a tent site. Briefly washed up in the pond, set up tents and crawled in.
Debbie is angry and frustrated in that she feels she told me clearly that she wanted to modify this section and take longer when we talked in Monson. Obviously I did not get that message and feel badly. I now have plane tickets and we have to meet our resupply so our ability to modify now is more limited.

Got to West Branch of Pleasant River about 12:30. It was a pleasant wade across. Had over 5 miles to get to shelter. Book indicated a gain of over 1000 feet. Trail was awesome for the most part. Ups were gentle or if steep were short. Whole trail was along the Gulf Hagas Brook and it was so beautiful. I continue to feel strong and like I finally have my trail legs and attitude right.
Glad we got to the shelter before 5 PM. Didn't have lots of vista type views today but the ones we had were very nice.

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547878,"Long eventful night. First we had a revival of the worst mosquito problem. Too hot to stay in sleeping bag and too risky to stay out. During the night a squirrel attached the hanging food bag. He was relentless. Finally I decided to risk a bear if need be and put my food bag in the bottom of my sleeping bag. Debbie put hers beside her and the squirrel was not deterred. I've never had squirrel problems on the trail before....mice, yes but not squirrels.
Today started with climbing: Gulf Hagas Mtn, then West Peak, the Hay Mountain then White Cap Mountain. West Peak and White Cap Mtns were hard slogs but we did well. I think Debbie's competitiveness kicked in. She was not going to be done in by the older physician! :-) Debbie has really had trouble with feet pain an issue she had in 2005 but not really since then. How frustrating..

After about 4 miles the trail became pretty flat and we just hiked! How novel, we just were able to stride out. It was marvelous. We had changed our shuttle arrival time to 5 PM so we woudn't feel pressured. We realized that with this trail we could easily get there by 3 pm. I race walked to where we heard there was a signal so I could call to change our time. I called and requested the time change from 5 pm to 3 pm. I heard to answer to be that they would do it as close as possible. Got to Jo Mary Rd at 2 PM. Washed up and soaked feet in stream.
Delivery of supplies did not come until 5 PM Grrrr! However, in addition to the resupply for our trip, we had also ordered pizza and beer. It was lovely. (Side note: our pizza was to be sausage, pepperoni,and mushroom. pizza delivered was ham and pineapple!) Oh, well, it tasted fine to me and the beer was great.

Ended day at a marvelous campsite on the lake. Very private. Sandy beach. Swam in the lake; washed shirt and underwear. Ate early. Bullfrogs calling.
Tonight I put my rainfly on my tent. Last night the stars were shining and I left my rainfly off. You got it, it started raining during the night and I was really scrambling. Pretty funny actually.
I'm pretty excited. We have two more days of hiking to get to Abol Campground. 3 days to the Birches and day 4 Katahdin!!!
Highlight of the day. Met woman and man who looked to be early 60s who told me that when they made summit of Katahdin there was a 70 year old there. I told them I was 70. The woman looked shocked. Thought I was at least 10 years younger! Sweet. May have been blind but you take what you can get. :-)
Debbie and I both fell on slick rocks in separate creeks. I really hit my left knee. Debbie clobbered her knee. I sort of did the splits and couldn't get up. Both feet were stuck between rocks in the stream. Got an unintentional bath!

Up and on the trail shortly after 6 AM. Beautiful serene view over the lake this morning.
First order of business was to climb Nesuntabunt Mtn. Very wild as we climbed. House size boulders are scattered around covered with deep moss. Some rocks had ferns growing off them (see photo). Some steep sections but we maintained 1 1/2 miles/hour pace. Trail had lots of roots and mud. It was predicted to possible rain at noon. Debbie wanted to get to Rainbow Lake Lean To to shelter from the rain. She pushed hard when possible and we got to lean to a little before noon. NO RAIN. Took about an hour to eat, get some water and just relax.
We had 3.8 miles to our campsite. At about 0.6 miles from the campsite it began to thunder. We hustled and arrived just as it began to sprinkle. With great speed we both got tents up and everything inside before the real shower commenced.
Sun came out and we washed up in the lake. Great spring for water. Lots of mosquitoes so went into the tent early to survive.
Tomorrow to Abol Campground and showers. I can hardly believe that I am almost finished with the AT. Only 26.3 more miles. My body feel pretty beat up but I also feel like I can do this.

Hate packing up wet stuff. Soon we were in a cloud. Trail today was full or roots, rocks,andmud. Becomes very wearing to have to watch each foot placement. Walked along the Rainbow Lake but it was shrouded in fog.
Today was at times like yesterday with very wild, dense woods, huge boulders and thick, deep moss. More up and downing. Climbed Rainbow Ledges but still in a cloud so no view of Katahdin. 
Did get a signal and Debbie talked to her nephew, Raymond. He will come join us on Tuesday night and climb Katahdin with us. Made plan for food, where to meet, etc. 
Arrived at Abol Bridge Campground. It is quite primitive and ""off the grid"". Electricity by generator. We rented a bunk room - no linens or electricity. Bath house had great showers. It feels so good to be clean. Cafe had good food - loved the Reuben and home made potato salad. 
Spent time in bunk room relaxing. Spread tent fly out to dry. Both of us feel really tired and beat up but ready to ""get 'er done"".
It rained again this afternoon but only after we had arrived! Enjoyed a bowl of clam chowder for dinner. Real food surely is great.

The sign in is about 1 mile from the campground. Debbie was ""on it"". She loves breakfast but she barely ate breakfast then started down the trail like a race horse. I couldn't really keep up. It was hilarious as we ended up being the 1st two to sign up for the Birches. (We ended up believing that this was all a crock. When we got to Baxter Park Ranger Station,there was no mention of the sign up and it seemed to be first come, first serve. Sort of like the pre-sign up for Baxter State Park that we did in Monson.....didn't seem to make any difference at all).
The trail and the morning were beautiful. Trail was very pleasant. One Way was correct. It was a very enjoyable 10 + miles. A beautiful creek ran along the trail much of the day with numerous water slides, waterfalls, and the wonderful water sounds. It was like the trail gave us a sample of all the best parts of ME: magic areas with huge moss covered boulders; soft pine covered trail; some moderate roots; some rocks; a few climbs....
We walked quickly. Had two fords in swift very rocky Neosowadnehunk Stream. I was fording barefoot - two swift for my Crocs and I did not want to get my boots wet. Fell both times but neither was a disaster. Just got shorts wet to waist and bottom of backpack. No injury
Arrived and did the check in process - registered for the climb tomorrow. Paid for the Birches. Raymond not here so we have our spot but may be able to share campsite with Raymond. At 4 pm still waiting for Raymond. He is supposed to bring us dinner.
Katahdin looms over the area. It's a huge mountain. Will climb over 4000 ft tomorrow. I'm hoping it will be easier to do it than to fret about doing it. May go up by AT Hunt Trail but down by Abol Trail. Supposed to be easier descent and slightly shorter. We'll see. Weather predicted to be clear but windy. Also will be cold. Talked to a couple of hikers we had met who summitted today they all said that it was a touch mountain.
Raymond arrived. His camp site very close to trail head and also to privy. We decided to share his campsite. He brought pizza. Delicious. Fun evening visiting and getting to know him.","Abol Bridge Campground

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547967,"Just to make it clear. The Appalachian Trail ends at the summit of Mt. Katahdin. I could not stay there so my total miles for today was 10.4. I did hike down!
All of us were up early today and ready to hit the trail a little before 6. Raymond's Prius would not start because his key battery was dead. He had to move his car from the campsite to day parking. After a great deal of consternation, Debbie and I realized that my lithium battery in a head light might work. It turns out that was the case and we were able to move the car and get started. We started at the trailhead at about 6:25.
The first mile up was fairly gradual with the usual ME trail tread. Passed the Katahdn Stream Falls at mile 1.3 - very beautiful but I have to admit I was focused on what was to come. I was hiking ahead of Debbie and Raymond. It was nice to not feel like I would be abandoning Debbie. My head was full of contemplation and memories. I have been hiking on the trail since 2002. I never thought at that time that I would hike the entire trail. I have hiked the trail with different hiking buddies....so much to think about and so much to remember.
The trail got quite rough requiring scrambling up steep steps and increasingly steep. I felt like I made steady progress towards tree line. I was having fun in a rough sort of way. Have to look ahead and figure out how I can make it up. The wind was really picking up and in spite of the work of climbing I started getting cold. I put on my puffy. Just before tree line I sat down to wait for Raymond and Debbie. While there I met a NoBo thru hiker that I knew and he talked about how hard the climb was ahead. Debbie and Raymond were not very far behind. The next bit of the trail was a major challenge. One of the places had a piece of rebar to help and I made it but Debbie is a bit shorter.....don't know how a really short person or someone climbing alone would have made it (see the photos). Speaking of photos, I took very few. I had little time or energy for pictures. I felt very focused on the trail and being safe and moving forward. 
At last we climbed up a steep rock fall - pretty long and required a lot of concentration. When I reached that, I could see that we had a stretch of more level trail. Raymond went on ahead and I waited for Debbie while trying to hide behind rocks to protect from the howling wind. Luckily the sun was shining but the wind had to be 30 - 40 mph. Hiked with Debbie across the tableland. This was a welcome break because way in the distance could see the climb to the summit with lots of people on it. From climbing other mountains I knew that it would take longer and be farther than it looked.
Started the climb with the goal in sight but as I thought it took awhile. Again I was hiking alone with my thoughts. At the last cairn I again waited for Debbie and Raymond. I definitely wanted to summit with the best hiking buddy ever! 
It was very exciting to take pictures at the iconic summit sign. Everyone was so excited and complementary of the success of others. It had taken about 6 hours to get to the top (5.2 miles). After enjoying the round of pictures, it was time to find a rock to hunker down and eat lunch.
We had decided to descend by the Abol Trail which we took while we were on the table lands. As soon as we left the table lands we were on the side of the mountain that had the wind blocked. It was a great relief to be free of the wind pushing and tugging and affecting my balance. HOWEVER, we were looking at a very steep descent on a long, long rock fall. Started the tedious and caution-requiring descent. It went on and on! About 2/3 of the way down the rock slide I fell. I'm pretty sure I did a flip but it was so fast I'm not sure. I really bruised my right deltoid and scraped my leg but I'm OK. I just sat for a bit to collect myself and assess the situation then soldiered on. I really don't know what happened. Finally came to the new trail that the ranger had told us about but it continued it's steep descent for another 45 minutes. Fell again on pea sized gravel and scraped skin from back of my right hand and my nose. Less violent fall, though. After steep, steep descent finally reached trail that was more reasonable and was able to hike more normally. It seemed forever to get to the Abol Campground. We were all exhausted. Total of 11 hours hiking.
I started hiking to the Katahdin Stream Campground to get our car and was lucky enough to get a hitch. About the time I got there, Raymond and Debbie had also found a ride so we were all there and ready to head out - the 3 - 4 hours drive to Raymond's home in Lewiston.
I feel proud. I feel exhausted! I feel beat up! It's done. I think maybe I'll celebrate more when I recover and when it really sinks in.
footnote: I don't plan to hike in ME anytime soon. It is very beautiful but it is also very difficult. Sure glad I did wait until I was 75!!!","Katahdin Stream Campground

Lucky Dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547969,"Darby and Raymond, Debbie's niece and nephew-in-law, have graciously opened their home to me. We had the fun of the LLBean mall in Freeport yesterday. Today we have been in Portland. Visited a brew pub and a exhibition at the art museum. Finished off the day at a wonderful lobster shack on the bay. Great food and locale and even better company. It was a perfect way to finish this trip.
I am now in the motel and will catch an early flight back home. I'm very ready to see Mike. My body is still complaining about it's treatment. I have quite of bit of lower extremity edema. I guess just from the inflammation of my muscles???? I'm sure it will eventually go away. Numerous bruises dot my body. Sort of look like I might have been on the losing side of a fist fight.
People ask me what I will tackle next. Of course I will continue to backpack. I love it but I am not ready to lay out some grand plan. For now I will just savor the moment. I truly feel like a Lucky Dog","Mt. Katahdin
