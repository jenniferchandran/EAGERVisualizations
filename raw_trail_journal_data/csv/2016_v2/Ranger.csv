Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522005,"It's time (well, past time really) to gear up for my 2016 AT hike. I did a 2 week hike in 2014 and a 4 week hike in 2015 and am planning on rejoining the AT where I got off last year near Marion, VA. I absolutely loved being on the Trail for a month last year and dearly wanted to continue. However, Life has other considerations and after 3 family weddings and a new grandchild last year, I believe this year will be the year to complete the AT.With the experience I gained from the two previous years I'm going to make a few improvements to go lighter - we all say that and its hard. I've tried to take advice from the ultralighters I've met on the trail and have made a few gear changes from last year to drop a few pounds. We'll see if that improves my speed and endurance.",,Kansas,"Feb 28, Sun",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523670,"My preparation continues - and my major accomplishment this week was to order the AT Guide from AWOL. This little gem is one of the most valuable items to have when you are hiking the AT.One the highlights of Trail Days for me last year was to meet a number of the authors of various AT books. Skywalker - AWOL - Gene Espy - all of these authors have made the trail so vivid for me as I planned and dreamed of thru hiking the AT. I was particularly surprised when I met AWOL - quiet and gentle - I had imagined him being much more gregarious. I don't know much of his history, but I am ever thankful of his contribution to hikers with his maintaining and publishing the AT Trail Guide.I also had a chance to meet Gene Espy - a true pioneer of the AT - the second man to thru hike the AT in 1951. I now have a signed copy of his book ""The Trail of My Life"" that I will cherish forever. These humble men are the stuff that the trail is made of - and made for.",,AWOL's AT Guide Ordered,"Mar 15, Tue",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529019,"I'm finally on my way to the Trail, indirectly. My wife and I left KS on Monday for a slow trip to Cape Cod, MA where we would work on our cottage for a week before I head for the Trail. Along the way I was able to stop at a couple of the places I've always wanted to stop along I-70 - The Wilbur Wright birthplace and museum in Millville, IN and the National Air Force Museum at Wright Patterson AFB. The Wilbur Wright site was really interesting; he only lived there for 18 months but they did a fantastic job of incorporating Life in the 1800's with the history of how the Wright brothers succeeded in conquering powered flight. The other end of the spectrum was the USAF museum which is just an incredible cathedral to the finest aviation technology there is. As I walked thru the museum I was bathed in Awe! There are many more aviation historical sites in Dayton, OH so I will be back. It was a stop and smell the roses type of trip instead of rushing across the country and seeing how many miles we could make. And it was almost not to be. I had a personal goal I had to complete before I could leave for the Trail, I needed to pass my Certified Flight Instructor practical test. I passed the test on April 14, so now I am a Flight Instructor! Ever since I retired from ""corporate life"" two years ago I have had two major goals to complete so I could start my ""new"" life - completing the AT and getting my Flight Instructor certificate. One is now complete, one is still in the works. Both are significant achievements that will help pave the way for how I want to live in the next phase of life. They are part of the Inspiration I found on the Trail last year, and with God's grace and help I will achieve this next goal. I'll be flying to Charlotte May 1 where my brother will generously shuttle me to the Trail. And I will be off ...",,"Cape Cod, MA","Apr 21, Thu",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531307,"White Blaze ReunionFinally back on the trail! And it was almost not to be. I woke up last Friday morning with a sore Achilles' tendon and was hobbling badly. After a long afternoon in the Urgent Care center I got the necessary drugs and started feeling better by Saturday afternoon. What a disaster if that had happened once I started on the trail! A reminder that success and disaster on the AT are always inches away. One slip, one twisted ankle, one fall can end a hike.My wife and I parted ways Sunday morning and I flew down to CLT where my brother graciously was giving me a ride to the trail. He surprised me once again with Chocolate Eclairs from our mother's recipe book! Just like Mom used to make! We spent the evening shopping for last minute supplies and food for the first week, packing, weighing, throwing stuff out, reweighing. My pack was 39 pounds with a week's worth of food and no water. Ugh! I had worked to get it lower, but had pared down what I felt I could given the expected weather.Monday morning came and we headed for Beech Gap Trail. This week was about completing a 75 mile section that I wasn't able to complete over the last two years. Once I completed it, I will have done the southern 517 miles of the AT. After completing this section, my brother is going to pick me up at Fontana Dam and take me back to Marion, VA where I got off last year. Then I will begin my trek north to Maine.Arriving at Beech Gap Trail via some ""scenic"" back roads, It looked as it did two years prior. I hefted my pack on, took the obligatory trail head picture and started down the trail. Two years ago my friend Indy and I left the AT via the Beech Gap Trail when our hiking time had expired. Now it was time to rejoin the AT where we had gotten off.Beech Gap Trail is generally uphill back to the AT but not too bad. It took me about an hour and I arrived back in the AT once again, a white blaze reunion. It felt good and Beech Gap looked just as I remembered it. There was one tent set up, and I was trying to decide whether to push on or stay the night. With a couple hours of light left I decided to push on and see how far I could get.There were only 3 groups of tenters that I saw over the next three miles, which I thought was pretty light. After 3.2 miles I arrived at Carter Gap shelter. There were 5 tents set up but no one using the shelter. Hearing thunder in the distance I decided to sleep on the shelter for the night. There were two guys in the shelter eating there dinner, Josh and Thomas. They were medical students about to graduate on Friday. Josh was assigned a hospital in Baton Rouge for his residency, and was trying to get a last few nights in his beloved Appalachians before heading for the flat lands. When you looked in his eyes you could see he was really going to miss this part of his life.I hung my food bag in a tree, ate a few snacks, hung my pack and talked with the guys. When it started to rain they headed for their tent and I bedded down for the night. The shelter was pitch black with no light coming from anywhere. The sky was overcast and no lights were visible from any towns or houses in the valleys below. I was back on the AT once again, working to fulfill my goal, and it felt great. It was only 9 pm and I was asleep instantly.","Beech Gap Trailhead

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531308,"AT 2 May - Carter Gap Shelter to Franklin, NC.   15.9 miles Shelter WisdomIt rained on and off through the night, the sound accentuated by the shelter's tin roof. I woke up at 6 and about the same time another hiker was coming in the shelter to fix her breakfast. Caroline was through hiking and had gotten a late start on the they hiking season as she finished her classes. She wasn't concerned about the late start, and really wanted a chance to thru hike before starting her career. She was experienced with the AT up in New England so she knew what to expect when she got up there.We are our breakfasts by the light of our headlights as it was still dark. Occasional rain spit down but it was mostly light now. As I packed my pack it slowly got lighter and I could see that there was still a very low overcast cloud deck. By 7am I was ready to go and headed out, Josh and Thomas had just arrived and we wished each other good luck. These guys would be saving people's lives in a few weeks, I was going to be walking. It put things in perspective.The trail was pretty gentle here, with elevation gains in the 500 foot range. With the low clouds and mist I couldn't see much of the valleys below. It started raining steadily but lightly. The temps were very comfortable and it was pleasant walking for my first day back on the trail. Caroline came from behind and passed me quickly and I do believe she'll make Maine, she was a strong hiker. Good Luck to her. By 11 am I had made it to Albert Mountain, a short but steep climb up to the summit where there was a fire tower. The views were supposed to be impressive from there, but I didn't expect to see much with the clouds and mist.The trail up Albert Mtn. was very steep and the rocks were wet and slick. It wouldn't have been much of a challenge except for the 40 pound pack on my back. My legs and lungs protested but we finally made it. Albert Mtn. looked like line a great place as the tower rose high above the trees. The cab was closed but you could climb the steps and see some nice views in several directions, with clouds and swirling mist blocking views in others. It made for a beautiful sight.I had a quick lunch at Albert and then pushed on. I came in to Long Branch Shelter and used the privy and take a break. I checked the shelter journal to see who was ahead of me. Most of the thru hikers had passed though this part of the trail 4-8 weeks earlier so it was interesting to read the journal. There was a combination of optimism and dismay as I read they the entries, but there was also a few nuggets of wisdom. The simplest was one from Lesly - ""Be Joyful"". There was an interesting poem from Square Peg that I took a picture of. And then there was an entry from Hawkeye and Backup - ""Live, Love, Give""I pushed on all afternoon and was hoping to make it to Winding Stair Gap. From there I could catch a shuttle into Franklin, NC. Even though I was only one day out I was looking forward to visiting this famous trail town and getting people food instead of a pot of ramen for dinner. I made it to Winding Stair by 5 and there was trail angel there in the parking lot who would give me a ride to town. He was also picking up trash and collecting trash from hikers as they crossed the gap. I can't tell you how welcome that simple act is, someone collecting your trash from you so you don't have to haul it in your pack anymore. Intense offered me a ride to town and gave me a tour. I chose to stay in the Sapphire Inn because it had a Mexican restaurant across the street. The Sapphire had recently been sold and was under new management and apparently the reviews said said it was a lot nicer. It's a typical old style motor hotel and was very hiker friendly. I headed over to Mi Casa for dinner after a quick cleanup and had a great meal along with a couple of Margaritas to celebrate!A good first day, and ready to push on in the morning. Glad to be back!","Carter Gap Shelter

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531814,"I woke up in the comfort of the hotel room, the promised overnight storm never materialized. I caught up on trail journals and email, and then walked to across the street for an all American breakfast - McDonalds! Dollar General was right next door so I looked around and got a couple lunch snacks.Franklin has a wonderful shuttle for hikers for $3 and it picked me up at 9 and took me up to the trailhead at Winding Stair Gap. At the Gap, there was trail magic in progress and a couple of Trail Angels were cooking breakfast for hungry hikers. Granny and Old Goat were their ""trail names"", and they had been doing this for two years, stopping at a road crossings with parking lots and cooking up a feast and providing free meals to hikers. This morning was pancakes, this afternoon would be pulled pork sandwiches, and then hot dogs when the pork ran out. They also had coffee, hot chocolate, soft drinks, and assorted cookies and cakes. Trail Angels line these two are a Godsend for hikers as you grow really tired of ""camp food"". God Bless them! My thoughts ran back to the Shelter Wisdom from yesterday, ""Live, Love, Give"".I started up the trail at 10 due to the shuttle ride and talking with Granny and Old Goat. The weather was clear and cool after the cold front moved through last night. At 1 pm I arrived at Siler Bald and I was climbing to the summit, I met Norman Smith out for a day hike. Norman looked out over the verdant hills and exclaimed, ""If you can't appreciate this there must be something wrong with you!"" Norman was right of course, and we talked for a while about thru hiking and the Trail. He day hikes when he can and his enthusiasm was infectious.I continued to the summit, took pictures, ate my lunch and marveled at the beauty of these mountains.On my way north I passed Norman again as he headed back to the parking lot and we compared notes on what hikers he saw as he walking. He was truly glad to be out there and I wished for him his dream of thru hiking the AT.The trail took me down about 800 feet only to climb back up another 1000 feet; and then down 200 and back up as other 300 to climb Wayah Bald. On top of this bald was an observation tower with spectacular views. The tower was named after John Byrne who had been a World War I soldier and Forest Service supervisor over this area.After some picture taking from the tower, I hustled down to get to the shelter as it was getting late and a lot colder. The shelter was about 800 feet down the bald and seemed a lot farther than the 0.9 miles on the map. At the shelter were 6 others, all from Florida. The main topic at the moment was the weather, as tumors of snow were floating around. Storm clouds were arriving and one of the girls had the weather radar on her phone and it showed successive waves of heavy storms heading out way. I was glad that I made it when I did because as soon as I finished my dinner and hung up my food bag the first wave let lose and pounded the shelter. The seven of us talked while the storm passed through, and then headed for our sleeping bags as soon as there was a break. Jazz Cowboy and I shared the shelter while the others were in tents or hammocks. Hiker midnight came at 9 pm tonight, with the sounds of rain on the tin roof of the shelter to lull me to sleep.","Franklin, NC

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532086,"Cinco de Mayo was our Snow Day. The rain continued all night long and the temperature continued to drop. It was a cold morning so I stayed in my sleeping bag extra long. Jazz Cowboy was the only other occupant in the shelter and he was hunkered down as well. Finally about 7:30 am I decided to get a move on and started packing up. I opted for a cold breakfast not wanting to get the stove out. I finally departed at 8:30 to cold temps and overcast skies. I was wearing my down jacket and pants for the first time, previously I had only worn hiking shorts and a T-shirt.As I walked it started to lightly sleet, and then a few snowflakes mixed in. As I climbed towards Cold Spring shelter it began sleeting and snowing heavily. When I got to the shelter I ducked in and met Lefty (a one arm hiker) and Lucy (his dog) and another hiker November. Both were dodging the brunt of the weather in the shelter. I ate a light lunch and the sleet subsided. I took off shortly thereafter, leaving Lefty and Lucy in the shelter, and the sleet and snow picked up again. The ground was warm so not much was sticking on the trail but visibility was down to 100 feet or so and the sleet kept pelting. A few minutes later I met Luna as she literally ran down the trail. She was dressed lightly in a tank top and a light poncho. We exchanged hellos and names and she was off down the trail. I'll never see her again I thought as she was literally running.The trail from Cold Spring shelter went down about 1000 feet to Tellico Gap, and then back up about 800 feet to Wesser Bald. The weather had cleared some by the time I got to Wesser Bald and I climbed the tower and got some descent pictures of the clouds hovering over the mountains and a few shafts of sunlight to highlight the mountains. A cloud was heading my way and just as I got off the tower it started sleeting heavily again.The Wesser Bald shelter was eight tenths of a mile and I hustled down the bald as quick as I could. I got to the shelter and it was filling up, and there was Luna with her friends. They had done 18 miles today. There was one spot left on the shelter platform and they welcomed me to it. I ate a cold dinner of cheese and crackers and headed for my sleeping bag to warm up.A little bit later Jazz Cowboy came in but the shelter was full so he tented outside. Then the three Florida girls came in. It was still raining so they huddled under the shelter roof for a while. They were in hammocks and the group encouraged them to string their hammocks from the rafters if they could. They decided they would try one, but the other two they would set up outside. Jane would take the inside hammock as she didn't have a tarp to go over it. Virginia started climbing around the rafters to string the hammock and she was very impressive. She got her trail name from that, she was now Spidergirl.By 6 pm those of us sleeping on the shelter platform were bedded down for the night. Jazz Cowboy and the FL girls cooked their dinners in the shelter and then headed for their tents and hammocks. As I was laying there I got to thinking how we as frail humans all needed shelter from the elements. Be it the wood walls and tin roof of this AT shelter, the thin nylon of Jazz Cowboys' tent or the tarps covering the girls hammocks; or the houses and apartments we occupy at home. We wouldn't last long on this cold rainy night. And the same goes for the rest of society, we all consider shelter a basic need. Most of the rest of the animal kingdom is adapted to survive in the weather without constructing a shelter. They generally only build nests or dens or lairs to birth and raise their young and then they abandon them. We humans are almost the only animal that needs shelter to survive even most ordinary weather. I've always understood that we humans differentiated ourselves by our ability to make and use tools. I suppose we also differentiate ourselves by our inability to survive the elements without shelter of some sort.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532101,"As the day lightened up outside the shelter, I lay there nice and warm in my sleeping bag. We were packed in like sardines shoulder to shoulder on the shelter platform, so I didn't want to get up and disturb the others who were still sleeping. Finally about 7 am Luna sat up and everyone else started popping up as they too were waiting for the first person to get up. Only Karma laying next to me was still asleep. I discovered down feathers floating around all over and found a hole in my sleeping bag that a mouse had chewed during the night - dang it. I must have spilled something on it he smelled. I felt a mouse running over me during the night and flicked him off, but didn't sense one chewing into my sleeping bag. Mice are always a big problem in these shelters and we take great pains to protect our gear from mice invasions.I repaired my sleeping bag with some tape and started gathering my gear. Someone gathered all the food bags hanging by the bear cables and I grabbed a breakfast bar to munch on while I packed. Nobody in this group made a breakfast or hot drink, they just packed up and joked with each other about how they slept or snored or other bodily noises heard during the night. They were a fun group to be around. It turned out that this ""trail family"" came together in the first few days out of Springer. Three of them started together, One Hit Wonder, Alice, and Luna. Karma, Castaway ( think the Tom Hanks movie), and Katmandu all joined up over the next few days. They all were from all over the country and all very fast hikers and melded into one of the most fun groups I've seen on the trail. They all walk individually at there own paces, but plan where to meet up each night. They were still calling themselves by their real names for the most part as they got to know each other before they got their trail names.We set out about 7:50 am headed for the NOC, about 6 miles away. There would be a restaurant there and everyone was dreaming of what to eat. There was a small uphill to start but the trail would be mostly downhill to the NOC! Along a ridge with some spectacular views, Karma passed me and exclaimed ""This is what makes it all worth while!"". At a spot called the Jumpoff, I passed One Hit Wonder admiring the incredible view and was able to get a great picture of the Nantahala valley below.The trail was slippery from the rain yesterday and at one place I went flying and tumbled down the trail. Nothing was broken except my ego, and a bent hiking pole. I proceeded down the trail more carefully and came upon Castaway who was having bad knee pains. I offered him some KT tape and we did the best we could to try to tape up his knee. He was likely having IT band issues. He was really concerned about being able to go on, and more concerned about leaving this trail family.I got down to the NOC at 11 am and the group called for me to join them at their table at the Rivers End restaurant at the NOC. The Nantahala Outdoor Center is a really cool place to visit if you live in the southeast with white water rafting, zip lining, and several other outdoor sports. For hikers it is a haven with a restaurant, an outfitter, and a convenience store for resupply.We all gorged ourselves for lunch (Pizza and beer for me!) and swapped life stories, got to catch up with family over free wifi, and charge up electrical devices. Back to civilization - food and wifi!!The bad news was Castaway decided he couldn't go on, his knee was just too bad. He contemplated his options and the family all discussed options for him to meet back up with them after he rehabbed.I was able to get my hiking pole repaired at the outfitter (Thank you NOC!) and everyone resupplied a bit. We were all sitting at a picnic table enjoying the afternoon and finally decided we needed to move on. We were headed for Sassafras Gap shelter and it was a horrendous 3000 foot climb out of the valley and 7 miles to the shelter. Everyone said their goodbyes to Castaway, assured they will meet up soon, and headed up the mountain.It was a long afternoon with the climb out of the valley and I finally reached Sassafras Gap at 7 pm. The shelter was packed and tents and hammocks were everywhere. The weekend crowds were out and there few places left to camp. The group had saved me a spot to camp with them fortunately! They all climbed into their tents as I set up my tent and ate a cold supper. I climbed into my sleeping bag thankful for some real food today, some beautiful views, and for being welcomed by this trail family.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532106,"It's warmer today! And the sun is shining! And I saw stars last night for the first time!It was a long night though as my tent, and everybody else's were pitched on a slope. There weren't any good sites left with all the people camped at this shelter site so we did the best we could. I kept sliding downhill all night and it made it tough to sleep. The morning was noticeably warmer and the sun was out, so all is right in our world!We packed quickly and took off around 8 am. We were headed for Cable Gap Shelter - 15.2 miles that would put us only 6 miles from Fontana Dam. I quickly was outpaced by the group, they are all such fast hikers but hoped I would be able to meet up with them tonight.There was a tough 600 foot climb to start the day to the top of Cheoah Bald, but the views on top were amazing! The trail was generally downhill from there down to Stecoah Gap, and among the way I passed the first trail crew I have seen repairing a section of trail. I will never complain about how much weight I carry (Okay, yes I will) seeing these guys and gals hauling up chain saws and pick axes and sledge hammers to work on the trail for US. They are volunteers and someday I need to make an effort to join a trail maintenance crew myself.As I continued down to the gap, I was passed by an uphill hiker who said there was trail magic at the gap. My pace doubled at the thought of food, and I literally started running toward the gap. Sure enough Old Goat and Granny were down in the picnic area feeding about 20 hikers! I got down there and they offered me a plate of food and a soft drink, I was in heaven! I ended up eating 4 hot dogs and two colas, beans, cookies, sautéed onions and grabbed an apple for later. I sat in a chair, enjoyed the sunshine and even had cell service to catch up with the family. What an incredible blessing this couple does for hikers. Thank you!   We exchanged contact info, and I started back up the trail. I should know that when this section of the trail is named Jacob's Ladder it's going to be bad. The trail went up 700 feet very very steeply, and it was a tough climb after a big lunch. Several other hikers were climbing out and we were all huffing and puffing up this section. From the top we could see some nice views through the trees, but then had to continue up some more along a ridge line before heading down a steep downhill. I passed Brown Gap Fork Shelter and still had 6.1 miles to go before getting to Cable Gap Shelter. It was getting late, I definitely had stayed at the gap too long enjoying lunch.The trail continued on through a variety up small ups and downs and I finally got to Cody Gap about 6 pm. It was another 3 miles to Cable Gap shelter so I decided to overnight at Cody Gap where there were some good tent sites. Only one other hiker was here, Papa, who had also been with the masses at Sassafras Gap the night before. I set up camp, and still full from my glorious lunch, just ate my apple for dinner.It would be nine miles to Fontana in the morning, longer than I would have liked, but I didn't want to go on to Cable Gap and find a full shelter site again. I planned on getting up early and getting a quick start so I could be there in time to meet my brother who was giving me a ride to Virginia. I was disappointed I wouldn't get to see my trail family again, but maybe somewhere up north they'll pass me and we can have a reunion.","Sassafras Gap Shelter
",Cody Gap,"May 07, Sat",12
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532108,"The wind howled over the gap all night long, sounding like a freight train at times. It was hard to sleep with the noise, and when I woke up at 4:30 am I couldn't go back to sleep. I layed there until 6 am when it was finally light enough to see without my headlight. I got up and started packing up and eating a cold breakfast. By 7 am I was on my way. Papa was packing up as well and just a few minutes behind me.
After a short 3 miles I came to Cable Gap Shelter and there were still a bunch of hikers getting ready to go. They said there had been a big crowd last night so I was glad I camped at Cody Gap. I signed the shelter journal and took off for Fontana. From Cable Gap the trail wound uphill for a couple of miles and then I finally got to see Fontana Lake below. It looked wonderful, cool and blue through the trees, and the morning was really warming up. The excitement of seeing Fontana was diminished as the trail continued to wind uphill along a ridge instead of down toward the lake. Papa caught up with me and we continued on and talked briefly as we leap frogged eCh other up the climbs. He was a retired school teacher from Colorado, out for a walk. He wasn't driven to complete the trail, but wanted to experience Nd enjoy it as much as he could.
We finally got to the long downhill section to the lake, about 2.7 miles and 2000 feet down. As tough as some of the uphills are, some of the steep downhills are just as bad on your knees. We finally made it to the Fontana marina and called for a shuttle to the Fontana Village. Papa was overnighting here before tackling the Smokies and I was meeting my brother here. I was now done with my southern clean up section! With that completed I was moving up to southern VA where I got off last year!!!
My brother Steve arrived an hour and half later after I had enjoyed a huge hamburger at the lodge restaurant. In about 4 hours we will cover what it took me 4 weeks to walk last year. After a couple of resupply stops we arrived in Marion, VA. I stayed in the same hotel as last year, the Travel Inn, and was even assigned the same room. I even went out for Mexican food at Mi Puerto as I did last year!
I was now ready to get on with the main part of my trip. Last year I left Queen Bee, BB, and BonBon here as they continued north and I returned home for my daughter's wedding. They all made it to Katahdin, and I was so happy for them as I watched their progress. Hopefully this year I will follow in their footsteps.","Cody Gap

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532314,"It was good to be back in Virginia and I took advantage of a morning in a hotel to catch up trail journals and email. Marion has a great transit system where they have a shuttle that will take hikers up to the Mt. Rogers Visitor Center for 50 cents. They stop at all the hotels and a number of other stops if you call ahead and take you up the mountain. My start point where I got off last year was about 10 road miles beyond so I ended up having to hitchhike the last 10 miles from the Visitor Center. I was fortunate and got picked up by a couple whose son had thru hiked the AT in 2014 and was now thru hiking the PCT.I was finally back to where I got off last year, took the obligatory picture at the trail sign and headed for Maine.   The trail in this part of Virginia was really gentle and I made great time compared to North Carolina. The ups and downs here came in 100 and 200 foot increments and not 3000 foot climbs and descents where I had just come from.The trail meandered through hillsides and meadows and the temperatures were really comfortable. I had a late start with the timing of the shuttle and having to hitchhike so I didn't get back on the trail until 12:30 so I didn't expect to get in too many miles. The terrain was gracious and at 10 miles where I had planned to camp, there was still plenty of day left so I pushed on. There were fewer opportunities for water in this section so my camping options were limited. At 12 miles I was getting close to be in range of Partnership Shelter at the Mt. Rogers Visitor Center and the draw was getting very strong to get there. At Partnership there is a phone (at the Visitor Center) where you can order pizza and have it delivered. The draw was getting powerful the closer and closer I got. I kept expecting to see the shelter as the miles clicked down but it wasn't to be seen yet. The thought of pizza for dinner was becoming overwhelming, and like a child waiting for Christmas morning, it seemed like it would never come. It was getting dark as it was around 8:30 and going through the tunnels of Rhododendrons made it even darker. Finally I got a glimpse of a tent, then two, then six and I knew I was almost there! There were a large group of hikers at the shelter and around a campfire and a number of them were eating pizza. I threw my pack down and scurried to the visitor center another .2 miles down the trail to call for my pizza. I didn't know how late they stopped delivering so I was hustling.I got to the visitor phone and called Pizza Perfect but they had a $30 minimum order- ARGHHHHH! I tried Pizza Hut and they didn't have a minimum and so I was able to get in an order. Jackpot! 45 minutes and it would be there. There were several other hikers at the visitor center eating their pizza and drinking beer. They offered me a beer (Double Jackpot!!) and introduced themselves - Caboose, Voodoo, and Limey.Forty-five minutes later I had my pizza and sat down by the light of the visitor center and devoured half a large pizza and two Pepsi's. The Pizza Proximity Equation had now been reset, and I was satisfied after a 16 mile day. Welcome to Virginia.","Marion, VA

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532901,"After my late night pizza fest the night before I decided to sleep in the shelter to avoid setting up my tent in the dark. The shelter was first class and had a large sleeping area in the ""attic"" in addition to the platform down below (the shelter even had a shower!) You access the attic by climbing a wood ladder, which was a little bit of a challenge in the dark and with a 40 lb pack on my back. There were about 8 people sleeping up there so there was plenty of room for me to throw down my sleeping pad and sleeping bag. I hung my pack and food bag from the rafters to avoid any mice attacks and went to sleep.In the morning I awoke early and climbed down the ladder to start packing up. A couple of campers had a fire going already and I had three slices of leftover pizza so I warned then over the wire and had a pizza breakfast! I was back on the trail by 7:30 am and feeling pretty good. The trail generally climbed for about 5 miles as it ascended towards Glade Mountain. At the top of Glade I was more tired than I felt I should have been, and several other hikers that passed me commented the same. I attributed it to the Pizza Proximity Equation, it works to pull you back when you are going away, just as it pulls you forward when you are approaching it.From Glade the trail descended toward Atkins, VA and I-81. There was a restaurant near the trail called The Barn that a lot of people were going to and it featured a 1 lb Hiker Burger. As I descended down the mountain I came to an old schoolhouse from 1894, the Lindamood School. It's part of a Settlers Museum in Atkins where school children can go and experience a day in the life of an 1800's school. There was a sign on the door that said Hikers Welcome and so I ventured inside. It was a very authentic one room school house with a lot of interesting historical artifacts, and trail magic! Though out of place, there were two coolers of pop and boxes and boxes of snacks. There was also a ""Magic Box"" of hiker supplies put out by the West End United Methodist Church. What a Blessing these people are! I grabbed a Coke and a couple bags of popcorn and sat on the porch and enjoyed the view. Other hikers were coming by as well and enjoying the museum's generosity and checking out some of the artifacts. A couple of the interesting signs they had there were ""Punishments for Students"" and ""Rules for Teachers"". Punishments included number of lashes for various offenses. Rules for teachers included things like that they were required to bring a bucket of water and a bucket of coal to school each day. One of my favorites was that each teacher should lay aside a goodly sum of his pay for his declining years so they won't become a burden on society. (Good advice for any age!). Teachers were paid $30 a month. (Pictures of these signs are in my photos, they are worth a look). If you are in the area, I highly recommend stopping in to see the school and Settlers Museum!After this delight, the trail wandered through meadow and hillside until it comes out in a valley with I-81 running through it. The noise of the interstate catches you off guard after days of quiet forest sounds. I followed the path onward to the highway and The Barn. I was walking with another hiker named Hopper at this time and we came upon a pair of Canadian geese with their goslings. One of the geese started chasing us down the trail, flapping its wings and squawking. It chased us a long way!We came out to the highway and I headed for The Barn and Hopper headed up the trail. The Barn was pretty spartan and it looked like they mostly survived on hiker traffic. I decided I'd have a ""real meal"" and tried the Roast Beef and Gravy. Bad choice, stick with the hamburgers if you come here.After dinner I headed back out for another mile or so to a campsite. A large and beautiful Cumulonimbus cloud was growing overhead. I passed through several pastures and back into the woods and found another hiker stealth camping. I decided to stop there as well and set up camp. Just as I finished setting up the rain started coming and as I dove in my tent a flash of lighting lit up the forest and was followed immediately by the clap of thunder. A close one!All snug in my tent it started to pour, another good day highlighted by a visit to the Lindamood school.","Partnership Shelter

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532902,"I broke a Cardinal rule of mine today - Always eat people food when you can. I had a late start due to early morning thunderstorms that rolled through the area. The storms finally cleared out about 8:30 am and then I got up, had a cold breakfast and packed up my wet tent. The camper next to me emerged from his tent and introduced himself as Grey Ghost, from Williamsburg, VA. We chatted for a while as we packed up, and then went on our way. The storm clouds had given way to blue skies and it was pleasant walking, though the trail was wet and slippery. We had found the mountains again and were continually climbing and ascending today. After a few miles I reached a milestone- 1/4 of the way to Maine! 547 miles down and 1642 left to go! 
Descending Walker Mtn. I came to some much needed pasture walking. I was suffering from low energy today and really welcomed some flatter terrain to make up some miles. As I approached Old Rich Valley Road I was saying to myself too bad there won't be any trail magic like yesterday at Lindamood school. I had stopped at the road to consult my map to see where I should try to camp when a pickup truck came driving by and stopped. A wiry gentlemen got out of the truck and pointed at a cooler in the back of his truck and asked if I wanted a drink. Trail Magic! He had a cooler of pop and I grabbed a Coke and we introduced ourselves. 
His name was Lumbermack and he had a farm just up the road where he had just opened up a hiker hostel last week. He had completed the AT himself in 2006, and a couple of years ago sold his place in North Carolina and bought this farm to be near the AT.
Now Lumbermack appears to be the kind of man that could have retired comfortably and enjoyed vacations in the Caribbean or such. The fact that he and his wife chose to relocate near the AT to open up a Christian based hiker hostel says a lot about his devotion to the AT, and his devotion to Jesus. They will no doubt be a great comfort to many hikers as their ministry progresses over the years. So if you are a hiker nearing mile 553.9 NOBO, consider staying at the Appalachian Dreamer hostel (276-682-4061). It's not in the AT Trail Guide yet since it just opened.
I however broke my Cardinal rule, it was 5 pm, I only had about 8 miles today and I decided to push on. As he drove away and I started up the hill I'm saying to myself ""Dumb Ranger, Dumb!""
I continued on for another 2.5 miles up a pastured hillside and down into the Holston River valley. Near the O'Lystery Pavilion I stopped at a campsite with a nice little brook beside it. It was a pleasant evening as I set up camp and cooked my noodles, but I still couldn't help think that I could be eating real food and taking a shower right now.","Stealth Camp above Davis Hollow
",Campsite near O'lystery Pavillion,"May 11, Wed",10.60
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532905,"I woke up to the sound of my little babbling brook around 6:30 am. I thought I heard a few light raindrops on my tent earlier, but everything was dry. As I was lacking energy the day before I decided to have a more substantial breakfast to try to get my energy level up. In a typical day an AT hiker will burn 5000-6000 calories and I rarely consume more than 2000 calories. That is why we have a preoccupation with food when we get into towns.
I packed up and started up the first climb, a fairly moderate 700 feet up Brushy Mountain. Along the way I met Homer (think Simpson). Homer was an engineer who had worked in the nuclear industry before he retired. He was section hiking and had just got on the trail. We made it to the top of Brushy Mountain and then down to the Knot Maul Branch Shelter where we ate some lunch. 
After lunch we continued on down Lynn Camp Creek and then up 600 feet on a steep section of trail to Lynn Camp Mountain. The trail went back down again to Lick Creek, before starting the big climb of the day, 2100 feet up to Chestnut Knob. We were having a mountain day once again. Homer stopped along the way to refill his water, I continued on thinking he would catch up with me.
Chestnut Knob was a brute, not so much physically as mentally. After winding my way up through forest trails I came out into the clearing which one would think is near the summit. There were beautiful views of the surrounding mountains that seemed to stretch on forever. In reality, the clearing goes on for 2 miles and you have to climb an additional 600 vertical feet. Unlike a bald, this clearing looked man made but that had gone unmaintained for a number of years.
I finally caught site the shelter on the summit and was relieved to finally be there. There was only one other hiker there, Golden, who we had met down at Knot Maul Shelter. I chose a bunk (a piece of plywood) and started arranging my stuff. The views from the top of the knob were impressive, with a great view down to Burke's Garden a couple thousand feet below.
Several other hikers started to arrive including Voodoo, Caboose, Strider, and Wildflower. There were storm clouds brewing and within a few minutes blue skies and sunshine gave way to storm clouds and a slashing wind. Caboose said it looked like Homer has set up his tent about a mile and a half down the trail near a pond.
We all started cooking our dinners in the shelter as the rain began pounding down. This was a fairly nice shelter made of stone and enclosed on all four sides. Someone read that it had been a ranger's cabin back when it was constructed. The wind and rain were really strong and once again I was glad to be in a shelter. I hoped Homer was surviving in his tent down the mountain.","Campsite near O'lystery Pavillion
",Chestnut Knob Shelter,"May 12, Thu",11.60
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533802,"The rain and wind continued all night long on Chestnut Knob. A little after daybreak the rain subsided and the mountaintop was covered in fog when we looked out. The temperature has dropped during the night and it was cold and windy. Inside the shelter we made breakfast and packed up. I departed the shelter about 8:40 and headed down the mountain to Walker Gap.
The AT Trail Guide showed the profile of the trail to be relatively flat after climbing out of Walker Gap and straddling a ridge line overlooking Burkes Garden. In reality, the ridge was a roller coaster of rocks, with 4 miles of constant ups and downs on mostly rocky trail. At the end of the roller coaster there was a 1600 foot descent down toward Jenkins Shelter and the first water for the last 9 miles. On the way down Voodoo and Caboose passed me, 2 of only 6 hikers I had seen all day. They stopped to get water and have lunch not long after they passed me. I stopped and talked with them and I found out that Caboose used to work at Yuengling brewery and then had a job selling hops to breweries. Tough job! 
After Jenkins shelter I had 4.4 miles to go to make my intended campsite. After a 600 foot climb the trail leveled out and actually was relatively flat compared to the earlier roller coaster. I descended down to Laurel Creek and arrived at a beautiful campsite. Golden was already there, as well as Yellowjacket. A few minutes later Jelly rolled in with his dog Maggie (Peanut Butter).
After setting up my tent and cooking dinner, I cleaned up and slipped into my tent. It was getting cold quickly as the sun set and looked to be a cold night again. Friday the 13th was in the books without any disasters.","Chestnut Knob Shelter
",Laurel Creek campsite,"May 13, Fri",15.10
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533803,"It was cold last night so I stayed in my sleeping bag until 7 am. I packed up, ate a quick breakfast and was on the trail by 8 am. My objective was to get into Bland, VA to resupply, and hopefully get some people food. I even had thoughts about getting a hotel room and taking it easy for a night.
The trail into Bland was relatively easy. After a 600 foot climb out of Laurel Creek the trail wrapped around a hillside and was relatively level and fast. There were a few outstanding views when there were breaks in the trees, but for the most part it was winding its way through thickly forested hillsides. As I approached Bland, I-77 came into view, or at least into hearing. The sound of the interstate was highly intrusive after a week of the quiet of the forest. It amazed me how out of place the sound was, a sound you tend to take for granted as background noise in the city. 
I made the 6.9 miles to the highway leading into Bland in 3.5 hours. I started walking down the road toward Bland, hoping to hitch a ride into town. After a few minutes a beautiful young couple stopped to pick me up. They offered to take me to the DQ which was also close to the Dollar General where I could resupply. As we drove they were interested in hearing about my hike and where I was from. They also told me about Bland and some of the attractions in the area. When they dropped me off at the DQ, the woman handed me a hand crocheted blue cross, and wished me luck on my journey. I hope to take that cross up Katahdin. 
At the DQ I indulged in a half pound hamburger, fries and a Blizzard. I called the only hotel, The Big Walker Motel and found that it was all booked for the night. That simplified my decision whether to stay in Bland or move up the trail, I would be going up the trail. It started raining hard so I hung out at DQ for a while and charged my electronics and enjoyed finally having cell service.
When the rain ended I packed up and walked down the road to Dollar General to resupply. I met Chromecakes and Easy coming out of the Dollar General and on their way to the DQ for ice cream. There were several other hikers, including Braids, in the Dollar General. It was like hikers had invaded Bland. I grabbed some supplies for the next few days and headed across the street to the Subway. I got a large Sub sandwich to go that would serve as my dinner and headed for the trail. After walking about a mile I was able to catch a ride up to the trail. The trail crosses I-77 at this point and I got a nice picture of the highway slicing through the valley. I met a hiker from Australia named Down Under at the highway crossing. He had been thinking about going into Bland but it was so late in the day he was concerned about being able to make it to the next shelter before dark. He decided to go on to the shelter as well.
The trail picked up again on the west side of I-77 and wound up a hillside. It was 1.8 miles up to the shelter from the interstate crossing. Along the way I passed a woman that was day hiking the trail and heading up to the shelter. She mentioned she had met a hiker named Homer earlier and was going up the trail to see if he was at the shelter. So Homer was up ahead! Down Under passed us as we took a break, and then we continued up the trail toward the shelter. When we arrived at the shelter Homer and Down Under were setting up in the shelter and preparing their dinner. Homer had been just behind me for the last couple of days but had passed on going into Bland. The woman was named Betty traveling to Buffalo and was interested in learning about the AT. She had been day hiking on the trail and sleeping in her car as she made her way north. We talked for quite a while telling her about the trail, some of our experiences and our gear. As she departed, Homer suggested she meet us at Trent's grocery where the three of us planned to meet up for dinner tomorrow. We gave her the trail name Buffalo Betty. It was just the three of us in the shelter that night with maybe half a dozen people tenting around the shelter. It was getting cold so we dove into our sleeping bags even before the sun went down. Hiker midnight came early.","Laurel Creek campsite
",Helveys Mill Shelter,"May 14, Sat",9.10
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533804,"Brrrrr, it was a COLD night for the three of us in the shelter. I woke up about 7 am and Homer was already taking off. We had a long day ahead of us to get to Trent's and he wanted to get started early. Down Under and I moved a bit slower and made breakfast and packed up. On the side of the shelter someone had written ""Live to Hike"" with a list of long distance trails we have in the U.S. Down Under snd I were looking at that and he was saying how lucky we are to have such a marvelous trail here in the U.S. It was true, we had a number of foreign visitors here to hike the AT. One of Down Under's major goals on hiking the AT was to get back in shape. He said he had already lost 20 kilos and was looking to lose at least 10 more. In addition, the mental and physical challenge of the AT was invigorating, just what he needed to jump start his retirement life. So in addition to ""Live to Hike"" the sign could have also added ""Hike to Live"".
We left the shelter about 8:15 am and walked briskly as it was still very cold and windy. I stopped to remove a few layers and Down Under kept moving on. At 10:19 am I was able to get a cell phone signal and I checked the weather. In Bland (1000' lower elevation) it was 39 degrees, wind chill was 30 degrees. Up here on the ridge it was certainly much colder. The trail was relatively level for the first 8 miles with just small climbs and descents. After passing Brushy mountain (yet another Brushy Mountain) the trail descended about 900' to Lickskillet Hollow which had numerous stream crossings. Along the way I passed the turnoff to Jenny Knob Shelter but decided not to go down to it. I was finally getting warm enough so that I could take off another layer and I was now walking in a T-shirt and hiking shorts. 
From the Hollow the trail ascended back up a hillside for about 700 feet and then ran another 4 more miles and slowly down 700 feet to Kimberling Creek. The trail came to a beautiful suspension bridge crossing Kimberling Creek and then then popped out onto a road. Trent's was just half a mile down the road from here. I had not seen a single hiker all day long.
At Trent's I found Homer and Buffalo Betty sitting at one of the two tables in Trent's. Trent's is a small grocery/convenience store out in the country that has a small grill that cooks hamburgers and the like. I ordered a Bacon cheeseburger and sat down with Homer and Buffalo. They hadn't seen Down Under yet and I hadn't passed him so he must have stopped at the shelter I passed. A few minutes later a couple of other hikers came in and said Down Under was behind them by a few minutes. 
When he arrived we talked about where to stay the night and we found out Trent's had one room behind the store that they rent out to hikers and hunters. Down Under was all for sleeping in a warm room instead of another cold night outside, and Homer and I agreed to split the cost of the room. It included a shower and laundry as well so it made for a pretty good $50 investment. We piled into the room and Homer agreed to take the floor for $10 and I chipped in $20 for one of the beds. We took showers, did laundry, and felt refreshed. Down Under crawled into his sleeping bag on one of the beds and fell asleep while we were still talking. Buffalo Betty went out to her car and slept in it as was her usual practice. Homer and I finally turned off the lights and crawled into our sleeping bags, clean and full and warm. A good day.","Helveys Mill Shelter

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533805,"We woke up at Trent's early, but waited till 7:30 to go for breakfast because ""that's when the biscuits will be done"". When I got there Buffalo Betty and Homer were already having coffee and biscuits. I ordered mine and sat down with them waiting for my breakfast. Down Under came in shortly and did the same. We ate up and made plans to meet at Woods Hole hotel which we heard was outstanding. Homer prodded Bettyvto meet us there after her day hiking so she could experience AT hostel life. She said she would and we all set off. I was the last one off and was behind the other two all day. The trail was fairly level and wound through a low river valley with numerous stream crossings and Rhododendron tunnels. I had lunch at Wapiti shelter, a sandwich I had ordered at Trent's to go! Then came a 1200 foot climb up to a ridge, and then the trail followed the ridge for quite a while. There were a couple of nice views, and I met Tick Tock on one of them. He was a lawyer from Boston. We wound our way down through rocks to Sugar Run Gap, and I headed down to Woods Hole. When I arrived, Homer, Betty, and Down Under were sitting with other hikers around the fire pit. (I want one!). I had made it just in time for dinner and the others had reserved me a spot in the bunk house.
The tradition at Woods Hole is that the owner, Neville, gathers everyone in a circle around the fire pit , we join hands, have a moment of silence for prayer or thought, and then proceed one by one to introduce ourselves and to say one thing we are thankful for. For me it was supportive friends and family. We then went to the picnic tables in back to feast on dinner - salad, fresh home made bread, and steak stir fry. It was just an outstanding meal! After dinner we helped out cleaning the kitchen and Neville served fresh home made mango ice cream. Delicious!!
It had been a long day and after sitting around the fire pit for a while talking with other hikers, I crawled into my sleeping bag and fell instantly asleep, thankful.","Trent's Grocery
",Woods Hole Hostel,"May 16, Mon",16.80
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533807,"Woods Hole is one of those very special places on the AT. The main house is an 1880 cabin that Neville's grandfather refurbished in the 1930's as a wildlife biologist graduate student. He later bought the property around it and refurbished again into a hiker hostel in 1986. He died shortly thereafter but his wife kept the hostel going and now it has been passed to Neville and her husband Michael. The main house has rooms that can be rented, as well as bunks in the bunkhouse. The focus of their farm/hostel is on sustainability and fresh local food, and house and bunkhouse ( it looks like it used to be the barn before being refurbished for hikers) are set up beautifully. Neville and Michael are both massage therapists as well as cooks, farmers, artists, potters, and business people. The good karma flows from them like water from a mountain spring.
After the best rest I've on the trail yet, we were greeted with breakfast of farm fresh sausage, eggs, fresh peach crisp and fresh fruit. I'm not a coffee drinker but their coffee was reportedly the best on the trail so far. As is their tradition, we gathered in a circle, had a moment of silence for prayer or reflection, and then went around one by one offering one thing we were thankful for. ""The best rest I've had in the trail since I started"", was my offering this time. They then passed out plates of breakfast food and we sat in their cozy living room and ate our feast. It was hard to leave a place like this, but we did one by one and said our goodbyes. We had only been there less than 14-16 hours and it felt like you were leaving home and family. Every hiker was in awe, and a few chose to stay another night to rest further.
It was on to Pearisburg for me, to resupply, pick up some mail, and potentially take a zero day. The trail to Pearisburg followed a ridge like the day before and it rained constantly off and on all day. We were up in the clouds so the viewpoints were a whiteout, a real disappointment. At Angels Rest it started raining harder and descending the mountainside became slippery and treacherous. I finally got a cell signal so I started calling a few places to secure a room for the night. I got one and slid my way down the mountain into Pearisburg. Once I hit the road, a short walk takes you into Pearisburg and my motel. I went by the post office to retrieve my mail, took a shower, and then met Down Under, Trail Talker and Limey at the Mexican restaurant. After a great meal and two margaritas I was ready to crash. It was good to be in town, but nothing like the thankful feeling of being at Woods Hole.","Woods Hole Hostel

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533919,"I woke up in the Holiday Lodge early and went to the laundry room to throw in my dirty clothes. I pack too many clothes compared to most thru hikers, I have two complete sets- one to wear and one to stay dry. I alternate them on laundry days. That's one luxury I need to think about doing away with to reduce weight. I watched some news (bad habit) while my laundry did its thing and made a resupply list. After my laundry was dry, I walked over to the Dairy Queen, which reportedly had the best breakfast in town. Down Under came in a little later and we talked about plans. I still hadn't decided whether to zero or push on. I then went to the Food Lion and resupplied food, went back to the Holiday and sorted through my stuff. Resupply days are a mixed blessing, more food choices but more weight. I just wasn't ready to get back on the trail on a cold overcast day so I made the decision to zero, but not here.
I called the MacArthur Inn in nearby Narrows and arranged a pick up. The MacArthur had much better TripAdvisor reviews and looked like a much nicer place to relax for the day. I walked down to the Pearis Mercantile, bought some fuel, and waited for my ride.
Alan Neely is the owner of the MacArthur Inn and he sports a huge mustache, biggest I've ever seen. He goes out of his way to be helpful to hikers and offers to help them with rides and anything else they may need. Alan took me to the MacArthur and gave me a little history of the Inn. It has been the host of a quite a few celebrities over the years, including John Wayne. The Inn has been restored by Alan himself and it is a beautiful property with 14 foot ceilings, antique furniture and fixtures. I settled into my room and intended to spend the day relaxing and recovering. Narrows, VA is a cute little town but lacks a restaurant, so I had to call for a pizza to delivered. I spent the afternoon catching up with email and updating Trail Journals. It started to rain, a slow drizzle, so I was glad to have chosen this as a zero day.
As night fell I got lucky and found the movie Saving Private Ryan on TV. It was still raining outside, and I was warm and comfy inside a beautiful inn, watching TV, and still full from my pizza. It was a great way to spend a zero day.","Pearisburg, VA

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534191,"I woke around 7 am after a very restful night in the MacArthur. The rain had stopped but it was still overcast. I went out to the breakfast area and Alan and a hiker, Crazy Ivan were there. Alan fixes a big breakfast of eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, and fresh fruit if you would like. I chose just to warm up some leftover pizza from last night. ""I knew there was something wrong with you when I met you"", smiled Alan through his huge mustache. An EgyptAir flight had gone missing over the Mediterranean Sea and cable news was full of non-stop coverage of the event, even though there was no real information yet. Crazy Ivan had come in after me and was ready to take off early and slack pack for the day and come back to the MacArthur that night. Slack packing is when you leave all your stuff and day hike a section of the trail with just a light knapsack, and then get a ride back to where you left your stuff. Alan would pick up Crazy Ivan later in the day and bring him back to the MacArthur. 
I planned on taking off later in the morning and Alan said whenever I was ready to go he could give me s ride back to the trail. We left around 10:30 am and the clouds were starting to lift. When we got to the trail, Uncle Spider and Reptar were being dropped off by a woman who ran a hostel. We said our goodbyes and started down the trail. After the rain yesterday the trail was muddy and slippery and the first thing I did was slip and wipe out. So much for clean clothes! The trail wound steeply down a hillside and through dense forest. The hillside felt almost sub tropical with dense foliage. At the bottom of the hill the trail runs through a field, crosses a road and past a sign announcing the Pearisburg cemetery. The cemetery contains graves from the late 1800's. We continue to wind our way further down to a busy road and a highway bridge crossing the New River. The noise from passing trucks and busses is astounding after you've been hiking in the relative quiet of the forest. We pass a Celanese plant that reportedly makes cigarette filters and is a major employer for the Pearisburg area. The trail then headed up a hillside back into the forest and the noise of the highway quickly starts to recede. I thought we were just about away from the city until the trail skirts past the Pearisburg landfill and the smell and sounds of it disturb the senses. The trail takes us up 1700 feet as we can see Pearisburg receding in the distance. It's always interesting climbing out of a town and realizing you were just in that town and part of it for 24 hours or so. Hopefully you made new friends there and almost certainly you were helped out by someone in that town as you continue your journey north. There will be many towns like that through the months and miles.
At the top, Rice Field Shelter sits in front of a large grassy field. It's a beautiful view and a sign announced the Virginia/West Virginia border. The view into West Virginia farms and mountains is spectacular and I decide to stay there for the night even though it's only 4:30 pm and has been a short day. The clouds have lifted and it looks like we'll actually be able to see a sunset tonight. Several hikers are at the shelter resting and deciding to go on or not. Gently and Scarface are from Tasmania, and they decide to go on. Another group of hikers including Vera, Lambo, Suki, and Whatever Works also decided to go on. Black Moon has decided to stay, it's only his second day back on the trail. Jeeves had been working on a fire unsuccessfully so I helped him with it. A few minutes later Pocahontas and her friend show up and planned to stay. They actually got trail magic down on Pocahontas road (Good karma for Pocahontas!) down below, including a Guinness beer, and with that her friend got her trail name, Guinness, as she drank her beer in front of us. It was Guinness' first night on the AT and she was just hiking with her friend for the day. A few minutes after, Slinger showed up. We all cooked our dinners and swapped trail stories. As sunset approached we all went out to the ridge and got set to take sunset pictures. Sunsets have been rare for me on the AT as you are usually in the trees or it has been cloudy. We got a few good pictures, but nothing like a good Kansas sunset.
As it got dark we all bear bagged our food and enjoyed the fire. After it died down we settled into the shelter. Slinger was a hammock guy so it was just Pocahontas, Guinness, Black Moon, Jeeves, and I in the shelter. It was a good day to be back on the trail, highlighted by a sunset and a new state.","Narrows, VA

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534192,"The beautiful sunset from the night before gave way to fog at night. I got up for a midnight bathroom trip and the trees around the shelter were masked in fog, dark sentinels in a sea of white mist. In the morning the fog has lifted but it was cold and windy. No one wanted to get up and get out of their warm sleeping bags. Black Moon finally started the process and got up and started gathering his gear. One by one we each started getting up and leaving our warm sleeping bags. I finally left the shelter at 8:30 and started down the trail. We were up on a high ridge that was the border of Virginia and West Virginia and we'd be following the ridge most of the day. The trail was fairly level with continuous small ups and downs, at least until mid-day when there were a couple of higher mountains to climb. 
With the terrain fairly friendly I settled in listening to an audiobook on my iPhone as I walked, The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch. If you hadn't seen The Last Lecture on YouTube, or read his book I highly recommend it. It's very powerful to see a man diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer deliver a real last lecture; which he used ""Achieving your Childhood Dreams"" as the topic. My own father died from pancreatic cancer at the young age of 60, and so it is especially meaningful to me. It's also meaningful in that walking the AT was one of my childhood dreams, one I am trying to fulfill.
After a short but steep 400 foot climb at the end of the ridge, the trail switchbacked down 1300 feet into a river valley. I stopped at the Pine Swamp Shelter briefly to say hello and check the shelter log. Down Under and Homer hadn't signed in so I wasn't sure where they were. The shelter was already packed as all the hikers had heard that a heavy rainstorm was headed this way and they were trying to secure a dry spot for the night. I had planned on getting a couple of more miles in today so wasn't looking to camp at the shelter, I was moving on to The Captains. I followed the trail for another 1.2 miles to get to The Captains. The AT Guide said you had to cross the creek by Zipline to get to Captains and I could see why. The trail was on one side of Stony Creek and the Captains was on the other. To reach his property he had rigged up a cable and pulley system so that you sat on a wooden seat, hooked your pack to a carabiner and pulled on a cable to pull yourself across the creek. This was so cool and epitomized the AT. Captain was just a kind soul that allowed hikers to camp on his property and had a few picnic tables set up, trash cans, a fire pit, a refrigerator with cold pop, wifi, and a charging station for electronics. If it was going to rain like it was tonight, he allowed you to sleep on his back porch. There are probably 20 hikers here tonight, and it is just a wonderful place to spend the night.
When I got here Pocahontas and Slinger were already here, as were several other hikers I hadn't met yet - Fish, Pluto, Bees Knees, and 4 hikers who were doing a south bound section. Additional hikers kept showing up as the evening progressed. Captain's gave us a wonderful place to spend the night with a number of conveniences that aren't available in a shelter on the trail.","Rice Field Shelter
",Captains,"May 20, Fri",13.80
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534395,"I slept great on the Captain's porch even though there were 11 of us crammed in like sardines. It seemed like it rained all night long, but not very hard. By morning the rain had stopped and there were just overcast skies. The four section hikers got up first while it was still dark and headed out. I got up and gathered my gear quietly as everyone else was still asleep. As I packed up my gear, Tarzan came out and did the same. I had a quick cold breakfast and ziplined across the creek. Back on the AT I met Spirit, a woman in her sixties. She had camped in the shelter before and had already hiked the 1.2 miles. She was obviously an experienced hiker and I learned she had thru hiked in 2012 on her fourth attempt. She had started at Springer three previous times and gotten part way before injury or family situation forced her off the trail. That is dedication! She was now hiking with a friend from Minnesota, but only ""half way""!
The trail was extremely muddy and slippery from the rain, and progress was slow. As we climbed Tarzan passed us, and then we met up with Uncle Spider and Reptar who had camped near the next shelter. I stopped in at the shelter and saw that Down Under had overnighted here so I was a few hours behind him. No sign of Homer yet. Slinger stopped in as well and then was off. The trailed leveled out some paralleling a ridge and became very rocky. Rocks are my nemesis, they kill my feet. I stopped for a water break and Pharmacist and Gingko came along and stopped to tank up as well. We had 6 miles to the next water. A whole group of young girls passed us southbound, Girl Scouts we presumed, and then we continued on. I finally got to Wind Rock, the top of this climb and Pharmacist and Gingko were already eating lunch. A great view and a perfect spot for lunch. Hey Girl, Fish, and Little Sister (and Glacier) then showed up and the six of us enjoyed lunch with a view. 
After lunch the trail leveled out and crossed over to Lone Pine Peak. It was pleasant walking as the sun had come out and the trail was relatively flat. After Lone Pine Peak the trail descended steeply 2000 feet down to War Spur shelter and Jones Creek. It sprinkled a bit on the way down, but overall remained a good hiking day. When I got to the shelter, there were several hikers there, including Spirit. Hikers were deciding whether to stay or push on, and I had already planned on pushing on. I probably should have reevaluated that decision, it was 4 pm and I would face a 1700 foot climb and 6 miles to the next shelter. I knew I would be in late, but thought it worth it to get some more miles in. Besides, there will always be another mountain.
I pushed on and started up the mountain. It started out benign with easy switchbacks and pine covered trails and I made good time. As I climbed higher it turned rocky and considerably steeper. I kept climbing and stopping to get some snacks, my energy running low. It started clouding over and raining so I stopped again to put on my rain jacket and pack cover. I continued up an finally got to the top, but the shelter was still 2.4 miles across the peak and down the other side. I continued on as quickly as I could until I got to a side trail to Kelly's Knob. It was supposed to have a good view and I never pass up a good view. I got over to the knob and it had some nice rock outcropping with a good view, though the clouds made it less cheery than it could have been. There was a couple camped out here so I decided to give in and pitch camp as well. I didn't need to get to the shelter, and if it was crowded when I got there I might have a difficult time finding a good tent site. So Kelly's Knob it was, I set up my tent, ate a cold dinner on the rock outcropping, and saw the lights of Daleville and Troutville far in the distance. Just as I climbed into my tent it started raining again, and I was glad I had stopped.","Captains

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534578,"A low mileage day, darn it. When I woke up it was still raining and cold up on Kelly's Knob. I used the time to update Trail Journals, and stay warm and dry in my sleeping bag. It finally quit around 8 am, so I got up and started packing up. I planned on eating breakfast down at the shelter 1.2 miles away, so I didn't bother with eating. I had good cell signal up here so I called home and got caught up, then headed down the mountain. The trail was slick and steep so I made my way down carefully.
Shotgun passed me on the way down and I met her at the Laurel Creek shelter. She was hiking with Happy Feet and Flash and they showed up a couple minutes later. I had some breakfast and they were talking about hitching into Newport to resupply. I hadn't planned on it as I didn't need to resupply. We started off down the mountain again and passed through some beautiful pasture. As we neared the road crossing an older gentlemen in a 4 wheeler passed by and I stopped to talk. Mr. Haney owned most of the pastureland around us. His aunt had previously owned the land the AT was passing through, and he was very gracious about the hikers passing through his turf. I thanked him for supporting us and complimented him on his beautiful pasture, and set on down toward the road. I had kind of made up my mind to try to go into town and get some lunch. Just as I arrived at the road, Flash had got a car to stop and he offered to give Flash, Wolverine, and me a ride into town. The only thing open on Sunday was a gas station / convenience store. Shotgun and Happy Feet were already feasting when we arrived; I went in and got two brats and a drink, and Flash and Wolverine went in looking for vegetarian fare.
It's always a magical time when hikers can feast on real food - even convenience store food. I remember one hiker asking another, ""Is it so wrong that I crave gas station microwave pizza? It's the best!""
After getting our fill, Shotgun, Happy Feet, and I headed for the road to get a ride back to the trail. Immediately Shotgun was able to get a woman in a pickup to offer us a ride back, so we hopped in the back and took off. Fastest hitchhiking ride I've ever been able to get!
Back on the trail, we wound through more pastures until we came to the Keefer Oak, the second largest oak tree on the AT. We took the required pictures, and then headed up a steep 1000 foot climb. There were switchbacks, but it was still a killer climb. Even the young guns were complaining!
The trail then followed a ridge for several miles before a turnoff to a shelter. I intended to bypass that shelter and head for the next one, 6 miles away. Just as I was getting near the turnoff it started raining and I could hear thunder in the distance. I decided to dash for the close shelter which was 0.4 miles off a side trail. What the trail guide didn't say it was also 500 feet down in a hollow. I guess I should have guessed since it was Sarver Hollow Shelter and not Sarver Ridge Shelter. I was the only one at the shelter and I made it just before the worst of the rain hit. I was very thankful for that, and reminded that the people I had been hiking with were getting drenched on their way to the next shelter. I don't mind hiking in the rain, but like to avoid being in s thunderstorm on a high ridge! A low mileage day, with thanks that there was a shelter there when I needed it.","Kelly's Knob

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535135,"I woke up at 6:30 am but didn't emerge from my sleeping bag until 7:30 am. It was cold, but at least it didn't rain all night. There was a bird's nest inside the rafters of the shelter and Little Bird, as I named her, was still on her nest. The only other hiker in the shelter had come in late. His name was Fresh Breathe and he had snored all night long. Fresh Breathe was a young kid, just out of high school, from western Massachusetts. I got my food bag down and made a breakfast of hot chocolate and a honey bun. As we were packing up Little Bird kept flying out while we weren't looking and then flying back to the best. I could finally hear baby birds chirping when she returned. While she was gone I climbed up in the rafters and got a picture of the baby birds in the nest. They couldn't have been much more than a day old. I hope that nest in the shelter works for them, Little Bird will be getting a lot of distractions with hikers coming in and out.
I departed at 9:00 am, dreading the long climb back up to the AT. For all my belly aching and fretting, it only took 10 minutes and I was back on the AT. There were beautiful views from the ridge and many rock outcroppings that the trail went over, and I was glad I hadn't attempted them in the Tstorm yesterday afternoon. The trail took me down to NiDay shelter where I had wanted to get to the day before. I had lunch there with several other hikers - ShadowFox, Yukon, New Hampshire Bob, and Myles. 
After lunch there was a 1600 foot climb up Brush Mountain and a memorial to Audie Murphy, America's most decorated soldier. Along the trail to Brush Mountain, another hiker pointed out some seashell fossils to me. Amazing what you find at 3000 feet and hundreds of miles from the current shoreline.
The trail then took a long downhill descent to Trout Creek, with a sign saying the shelter was only 1 mile. It started to rain and I didn't bother to put my pack cover on since it was only a mile. It was a LONG mile, and by the time I got to the shelter turn off there was a sign announcing it was another 1/2 mile to the shelter. I finally put my pack cover on as it was getting soaked. I made for the shelter site as quick as I could and when I got there there were lots of tents set up. ShadowFox said she thought there was still room in the shelter so I headed for it. When I got there there was only Fresh Breathe, Vera, and a section hiker Tim there so I piled in. I didn't want to have to deal with a wet tent in the morning. All in all a good day and it amazed me how lucky I had been to stop in the Sarver Hollow Shelter when I did. If I hadn't and tried to press on, I would have been trying to hike over those slick rocks in a storm and would have missed some beautiful views from the ridge.","Sarver Hollow Shelter
",Pickle Branch Shelter,"May 23, Mon",16.70
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535136,"Fresh Breath snored all night long again. I actually had a dream that Faith's boyfriend met us on the trail and brought us an oxygen bottle and mask for Fresh Breath to help his snoring. Throughout the night is sounded like rain on the metal roof of the shelter, but more likely it was just rain water being blown off the tree leaves. I moved slowly getting up, tired from not getting much sleep with Fresh Breath's all night chorus. I was thinking it was only 6 miles to the hostel, a shower, and then see where I go from there. Little did I know that was some of the toughest 6 miles I wound experience on the AT. The morning was sunny for a change, and Faith was excited and declared it summer. As she drank her coffee she said, ""You know it just feels like summer has begun"". 
It was a really tough, tough climb up to The Dragon's Tooth. The trail was very rocky and a had lot of ""climbing"". The AT Trail Guide didn't depict the profile as being too difficult, only 1000 feet up, but everyone I met agreed it was a tough climb through all those rocks. Once on top of Cove Mountain and then on the Dragon's Tooth however we were rewarded with incredible views! This was truly a day of big views! The sun was out and visibility was great so I was glad once again I was slowed down and able to enjoy these scenes. The day before had been overcast and cloudy, and that would have made for a disappointing day on this mountain. Dragon's Tooth turned out to be a popular day hike location coming from the north side parking lot and there were all kinds of day hikers climbing the rocks. It really jolted me to see all these clean, energetic hikers carrying nothing but a bottle of water to complete their day hike. The girls seemed to all be wearing cute hiking clothes which was a real change after seeing nothing but backpackers and thru hikers for the last few weeks. I of course had to climb to the top of the Dragon's Tooth and was rewarded with 360 degree views of the valleys below and the surrounding mountains. I met Faith just as I got back from climbing Dragon's Tooth and she was exhausted from the rocky climb as well. I told her to dump her pack and go check out Dragon's Tooth; it would make that climb worth it. 
Going down Dragon's Tooth was equally challenging with a 40 pound pack, and in several places there are metal bars drilled into the rock cliffs so you can climb down. It wasn't until 3 pm that I was down to the road and made the decision to skip the hostel and head down the opposite direction to a convenience store another hiker had told me about. I got two slices of pizza, a Coke, and an ice cream bar and was in heaven! As a bonus, I got a ham sandwich that would be my dinner and started back up the road to get back on the AT. There was a small climb but then the trail went through several pastures, along some streams, and then up along a ridge. I kept looking for a camping spot as the sun was getting lower. I finally found a good one and made camp. I pulled out my ham sandwich and savored every bite as I watched the sun sink behind the mountains to the west. Dragon's Tooth was behind me and tomorrow I would be up on McAfee Knob, one of the most photographed sites on the AT.","Pickle Branch Shelter

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535138,"For some reason I had trouble falling asleep, but finally did and slept until 7 am. Usually I'm out like a light when the sun goes down. I packed up, had a quick breakfast, and started down the trail. This would be a big day, McAfee Knob and hopefully all the way to Daleville, 21 miles away. To hedge my bets, I made a hotel reservation in Daleville when I had a cell signal. I got down to VA 311 and found lots of cars in the parking lot and lots of day hikers heading up to McAfee Knob. I didn't realize it before, but McAfee Knob, one of the most photographed places on the AT, was only 3 miles from this parking lot. In my mind seeing it's photographs in the AT magazine, I had always pictured it as being one of those secret treasures accessible only after a five day hike thru the wilderness. In reality, it's an easy 3 mile hike from a busy road up a well worn trail. As I was climbing, scores of day hikers were going up and down the trail, and here again, they were SO clean! As I approached the top there was an unassuming sign to a side trail that just said ""Overlook"". I decided to see what it was, and lo and behold, there was the iconic McAfee Knob. There was a line of people waiting to get their picture taken on the rock that juts out. In reality there is a whole line of rock outcroppings hundreds of feet long that make up the ""overlook"", but really only one spot has the Classic ""hang your feet over the edge"" view. I waited my turn and chatted with three women up for the day. They were interested in the thru hiking experience and I was happy to answer their questions. Finally I got my chance to get some pictures and it was a beautiful day for it. I hung my feet over the edge and asked one of the ladies to get some shots. I felt ""accomplished"", I was on McAfee Knob. After I got my pics I hustled on, I still had over 15 miles to get to Daleville.
The next challenge was Tinker Cliffs, which some people claim was more impressive than McAfee Knob and part of the Virginia Triple Crown - Dragoon Tooth, McAfee Knob, and Tinker Cliffs. The profile map shows it to be a similar climb as going up McAfee Knob. The profile map was deceptive though, after a fairly flat section connecting the Knob to the Cliffs, there was a whole series of climbs and descents along a ridge line to finally get to the Tinker Cliffs. It was so demoralizing to climb several hundred feet up to a ridge and then descend down a hundred feet only so you can climb back up a couple hundred feet, over and over again. Finally, I got to the cliffs and there were impressive views, but my weariness was zapping my enthusiasm. I stopped to have lunch on the cliffs before starting the long 9.6 mile descent to Daleville. The trail down passed through areas that had been closed to camping due to high bear activity, so I kept hoping to see some bears, but no such luck this time. The last five miles into Daleville were along a ridge with some wonderful rock outcroppings to view the valley and town below. On the other side of the ridge was a reservoir and the sun, sinking lower and lower. I was able to get some nice sunset pictures, but was getting concerned about the late hour. I finally got to the end of the ridge and the trail started to take me toward Daleville just as the sun set. I still had 2 more miles to go so I would be descending in the dark. I put on my headlight and hastened down the trail. As always it seems like AT followed the most indirect path possible. I finally emerged from the forest at 9:30 pm onto the highway that forms the majority of Daleville's commercial area and the Howard Johnson's hotel was right adjacent to the trail. I checked in and found scores of other hikers staying there, it was very popular with the AT crowd. As always, the younger hikers we're seeing how many people they could squeeze into one room. I was just happy to be there, it had been a long but memorable day. My day to go over McAfee Knob.","Stealth Camp near Catawba

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535191,"After getting in so late the night before, I decided Daleville would be my second zero day. I really needed a day to recover. When I got up in the morning I headed down to the breakfast area which was filled with hikers. It seemed like everyone of the hikers I had seen for the last week was staying there. I met up with Down Under finally, he had gotten in a few hours earlier than I had. He still had to resupply but wanted to push on in the afternoon; I told him I was zeroing. 
After breakfast I headed up the road to do my resupply and mail off some items back home. At the Outfitter, I found Down Under buying a new sleeping bag, air mattress, clothes, and boots. He was getting rid of his winter gear and going for lighter weight summer gear. I looked for a few things too and tried to buy some new inserts for my trail runners, but they were out of my size. I then walked the mile to the post office and finally back to the grocery store. It's amazing how at home I would never consider walking the half a mile to the post office, whereas here I thought nothing about walking a mile one way to the post office. Once I got back to the Kroger, I met up with Down Under again. He had been forced to take a zero as well because his shopping spree at the Outfitter had taken up his morning. We agreed to meet up for dinner that evening. I must have made 5 passes through each aisle of the grocery store trying to decide what to take for the next week's food. As usual I bought too much food, but it's easy to do when confronted with so many choices.
That evening Down Under and I walked up the 3 Little Pigs restaurant. They reportedly had good barbecue, but unfortunately not Kansas City style barbecue. I had a craving for a beef brisket sandwich, but ended up with St. Louis style spare ribs. Good, but not Kansas City barbecue good. After a big barbecue meal and a few beers we were ready to crash, so we headed back towards the HoJo. As we were leaving we saw several other hikers including Wunjenna (also from Australia), Porsche, and Faith. Faith said she had finally made it in this afternoon, after camping just outside of the bear closure area last night.
Once back at the hotel, Down Under and I agreed we would head out together tomorrow after breakfast, and we headed for our rooms. It was only 7 pm. A typical zero day - a lot of town walking to get food, mail or retrieve packages, eat as much good food as you can, and ultimately to rest and recover so you are ready to start walking again.","Daleville, NC

The shelter opening faced east so I was looking forward to a sun rise through the trees, but then it gave way to overcast skies. I got up about 7 am and retrieved our food bags, made some hot chocolate and had a couple of honey buns for breakfast. Breakfast of Champions! The Quebec ladies got up and made their breakfast. I noticed that they had fairly good gear but not that lightweight.It started to rain lightly and the Quebec ladies packed up fairly efficiently and left. Drew got up from his tent and made his breakfast while I packed up. We discussed Middle Creek Campground down below at the road crossing and how we heard they have milkshakes and a grill.I headed down the mountain slowly, blisters still painful but a little bit better. At the road crossing a guy in a van asked if I had seen Suki and Spirit - ""they are behind me but I don't know how far, I last saw them about 3 days ago"". I asked if he could give me a ride to the campground and he said ""no problem"". He was a thru hiker from past years and was out doing trail magic and was going to support Spirit and Suki for a bit.We arrived at Middle Creek and not surprisingly it was packed with RV's and trailers. No offense to the RV crowd, but it didn't feel like ""getting back to nature"" when you are parked 8 feet from the next camper. There was a pool, a basketball court, kids ridding bikes, and lots of people walking around. I placed my pack outside with about 10 other packs and went into the office and ordered a chocolate milkshake and a cheeseburger. There were lots of other hikers sitting outside or ordering food as well. This place was a thru hiker magnet! As I waited for my food 5 more hikers came through the door, including Drew. I noticed that Down Under had signed the hiker log this morning ""slept well and had a shower"".After I ate I got a ride back to the trail from Susan, the owner. She was asking about what I did and I said I was going to be a flight instructor. He son was wanting to learn to fly, helicopters, and she was hoping he could land an appointment to the Coast Guard Academy. Quite a change from growing up in the mountains of Virginia!Back at the trail I started the 1100 foot climb up Fork Mountain, then an 800 foot descent to Bryant Ridge Shelter. It was s spectacular shelter, with multiple platforms, a loft sleeping area, and a plaque dedicating it to Nelson Garnett, Jr. Aged 24 when he died. There was also a plaque entitled ""Tapestry"", with a poem dedicated to Nelson, from his sister I presume. I don't know anything about Nelson, or how he passed, or if he was a hiker, but this shelter is a beautiful testament to him and surely appreciated by thousands of hikers every year. R.I.P. Nelson.After a little R&R at the shelter, I started the 2300 foot climb up Floyd Mountain.   It was still slowly raining, not enough to get you really wet, but just enough to make you damp. Along the way Uncle Spider came up from behind and passed me. He said Reptar was not too far behind him. We both had the same idea, there was a campsite 600 feet short of the summit and I had decided to try to camp there. I was concerned that I would get to the Cornelius Creek Shelter and it would be full and all the tent sites taken with the rain. We pitched our tents in the rain and Reptar soon joined him. I prepared a bear hang and dove into my tent to escape the rain. It was coming down harder now and getting colder. I fell asleep briefly, but then ate some snacks for dinner and hung my food. The rain kept intensifying and it looked to be a long night of rain. Down below, in the Bryant Ridge shelter, hikers will be congregating in that beautiful shelter. I can't think of a better memorial for poor Nelson, keeping hikers warm and dry on a rainy, gloomy night.","Cove Mountain Shelter

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536349,"We woke up to blue skies and sunshine after a long night of rain. Uncle Spider and Reptar were climbing out of their tent about the same time I climbed out of mine. Everything was soaked so there really wasn't anyplace to sit down. I shook off my tent fly and then took it off drying to get it to dry a little bit. I started packing up and decided I would eat breakfast at the Cornelius Creek Shelter on the other side of Floyd Mountain, a couple of miles away. I packed up and strapped the wet tent fly to the outside of my pack. The last 700 feet of Floyd Mountain was a tough climb, so I was glad I hadn't tried to complete it in the rain last night. I got down to Cornelius Creek Shelter and there were still several hikers there packing up to leave. I hung up my tent fly to dry and got some water from the spring. Relaxing in the the sun I nibbled on some snacks for breakfast and pulled out food for the day. I signed the shelter log, packed up and started on my way again. I planned 14 miles today to Marble Spring campsite. 
A couple of miles down the trail I came to Black Rocks Overlook. I climbed to the top of the rocks and got some nice pictures of the mountains with clouds hanging over the valleys below. I had good cell signal up there so was able to update a couple of Trail Journal logs I was behind on, post a picture on Facebook and send some text messages.
Onward and upward I continued on to Apple Orchard Mountain, the big climb of the day at 1000 feet. The lower parts weren't too bad but the upper parts got steep and rocky which killed my sore feet. I was still fighting blisters on my right foot. On top of Apple Orchard Mountain was an FAA radar site, a reminder of my former career. Unfortunately there weren't any great views for the effort of climbing to the top and the trail immediately descended down a rocky path to the Guillotine, a large boulder suspended between two rock faces. 
Continuing down the trail crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway again and had a nice overlook for the tourists. I met Sticks there, a southbound Australian. I asked if he had met Down Under and he said he had met him a couple hours before. In fact he hadn't seen any Australians for months and had just met four in the last day - Down Under, Gently, Scarface, and WunJenna. 
The trail wound up for a short climb before descending 1100 feet to Petites Gap. I was able to get water from a spring on the way down as I had run out after the long dry stretch from Cornelius Creek. One final climb of the day stood before me, 700 feet up Highcock Knob. Once again the bottom parts weren't too bad but the upper parts were steep, rocky, and narrow. At the end of the day, 700 feet felt like 1700 feet. The climb seemed to go on and on. At the top, there was no view due to the trees, but the trail developers made sure you went to the absolute top of not one but two small rock formations at the top of the knob. 
The campsite was only a mile and 700 feet down now. My feet were screaming with all the rocks, but I hustled down and got to the site as quick as I could as there was thunder in the distance. I set up my tent just before the rain hit and shoved all my stuff inside. The rain came down and I munched on a few snacks for dinner in my tent, exhausted. Only 8 miles tomorrow and then I meet a friend at the James River who had generously offered "" a soft bed, good food, and a place to relax"". I can't wait!","Stealth campsite on Floyd Mountain

We had cell phone signal here and so I enjoyed a few minutes of catching up on news and email in my tent. I packed up and was walking by 8:15. I had 11 miles to go and 7 hours to get there so it should be easy. Chuckles came up from behind me and we spent the rest of the morning talking and getting to know each other. It was nice to have someone to walk with for a change. Chuckles was a 35 year old lawyer who was taking a break for 6 months. Not really a mid life crisis, just a chance to something epic while he was still fairly young. We talked about different experience people had out here, and how it was different for the 20 somethings versus the mid-lifers versus the retirees. The number of mid-lifers had definitely thinned down as we moved north. How the 20 somethings think and experience the trail must be so different from the retiree generation. They don't have the health and fitness concerns, but they also don't have the full richness of life to look back on. They haven't been married, seen their babies born, experienced job loss or triumphs, watched their kid hit their first home run or scored their first goal, watched a parent die, or seen sunsets from all over the world. All of that experience certainly colors your view of this trail experience. For me the trail was a capstone to my career and a way to start experiencing some adventures in retirement, for the young people it is the start of their grand life of adventure. For those that walk this trail, there is no doubt that they will be successful in whatever they choose to do in their lives.
The trail was great today, generally downhill and then relatively flat following a river. Another milestone was reached as we passed the 800 mile marker!! We came to the Pedlar River Bridge which was a very cool suspension bridge and it looked like a good place for a swim. We decided to press on to the shelter as the AT Trail Guide said there was a swim hole by the next shelter. There wasn't. There is a beautiful stream, but no swim hole. Arghh, I was looking forward to that swim. I was close enough to US 60 I decided to push on to make sure I was there early. Chuckles was right behind me and we got to the road with plenty of time to spare. He headed up the mountain and I waited for for my friend Matt. He picked me up at 3, and we went off to his house for a wonderful shower and to do my laundry. We then left and met up with our friend Don, whose house I had stayed at the previous night, and went to their Quiet Birdmen (QB) meeting. QB is a group of aviators that get together monthly for fellowship and a meal. Most of them were retired military and it was a honor to be able attend with my two good friends from our Oshkosh group. A beautiful night in the Virginia countryside, adult beverages, good food, great friends, and a great way to add another highlight to my AT trail experience.","Punchbowl Shelter

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536533,"I awoke at 6 am in the comfort of my friend Matt's house. The second night out of the last three that I had been able to sleep in a bed. At 7 I joined Matt and Lynne for breakfast upstairs and had a real breakfast with cereal and fruit and milk. A real treat. Matt drove me back up to the trailhead and I was back on the trail by 8:50 am. Not a bad start for having come from town. This would be one of the last big climbs for a while, 2000 feet up Bald Knob. We had driven up in fog but it was clear here, slightly cool but very humid. The trail here was not pretty, lots of waist high weeds, Poison Ivy, no breeze, and no views. The climb seemed to go on and on, finally coming to a flat spot that you thought was the top, and then the trail would dip down a little and continue back up. The morning was getting hotter and I was sweating profusely in the high humidity. My feet were aching, blisters on one foot and bruises on the other trying to break in new boots. And this is when you start thinking it may be time to quit. Why do this if it means hiking up these miserable climbs, through weeds, and high humidity. I finally got to the top of Bald Knob which is not bald at all, and start back down 600 feet to a weedy, overgrown gap and then back up 600 feet to the summit of Cole Mountain. Cole Mountain has a few Rock outcroppings near the summit so at least I had an occasional view. At the top, Cole mountain actually had some large grassy bald areas with some nice views. Over the top, there were spectacular views of the mountains to the north and large grassy balds full of wildflowers that the trail extended across. And this is why you don't quit. After all the struggle and heat of the morning, this view makes it all worthwhile. For every mile of trail, there are 10 reasons to quit - it's too hot or too cold, it's too steep uphill or too steep downhill, you are walking though a tunnel of trees that look just like the tunnel of trees you've seen for the last 50 miles, you are soaked from the rain, you are out of water, you have blisters. But it's the highlights that keep you going, the inspiring views, the mass of wildflowers, the sighting of a bear cub- it's the journey, and the goal of Maine.I continued down and the trail as it alternated between dense forest and grassy balds. The trail would have gradual ups and downs for most of the rest of the day. The shelter I was headed for was 14 more miles for the day. A light rain started and that helped to cool things down. Finally there was a steep downhill to the Piney River, a chance to get some water and 2 more miles to the shelter. At the shelter, Kemosabe, One Step, and Windwalker were already set up inside. Since everything was wet and muddy from the rain, I decided to stay in the shelter too and they made some space for me. I cooked dinner, got some water from the spring, bear bagged my food, and settled into my sleeping bag. Mix, a young hiker showed up just as it was getting dark and piled in with us. A few notes for the journal and I was dead tired, ready for sleep.","US 60 - Buena Vista, VA

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536880,"I awoke early just as it was beginning to get light out. Five of us in the shelter and no one snored which was rather amazing. I got up and went to relieve myself and then crawled back into my sleeping bag to rest some more. Like a chain reaction One Step, Kemosabe, and Windwalker all got up one by one and started packing up their stuff. Mix was still asleep and I lay there as they turned on their headlights and started deflating their air mattresses, stuffing sleeping bags into stuff sacks and packing their gear into their packs. It was a lot of commotion for such an early hour. Mix woke up and started packing himself up too. They all then had a quick cold breakfast and we're off by 6:30 am, and I was left alone in the shelter. It was really unusual because hikers in a shelter usually don't all get going so early, I finally sat up and grabbed my phone and started typing up a Trail Journal entry. I was way behind and was trying to catch up with past entries. Since I was alone in a quiet shelter it seemed like a perfect time to get caught up a little. The sun started streaming in through the trees and it looked to be a beautiful morning. I was on the trail at 8:45, later than usual, but not too bad. The trail took us up to Spy Rock and I passed a number of day hikers that were out for a Saturday morning hike. It still amazed me how they were all so clean and the women were wearing cute hiking clothes. It just kind of catches you off guard when you are used to being around thru hikers all the time. I dropped off my pack near a campsite a short walk from Spy Rock and went to climb it. Spy Rock was a massive rock probably 200 feet in diameter and 75 feet high. On top you had clear views of the mountains around, or were supposed to because when I got up there there was fog climbing up from the valley below and enveloping the mountains in white mist. It was beautiful as the mist swirled its way up around the mountains and one minute you would have a view of the mountains and the next you were standing in a cloud. I met Five Toes and The Mothly Stud on top. They were camped out just below and had come up to have their morning coffee on the Rock. They were walking to Maine as well and had started a couple of weeks ago at McAfee Knob. The Mothly Stud had section hiked the AT south of McAfee Knob and like me, didn't want to repeat the sections he had already hiked. He had planned on section hiking all the way, but his girlfriend Five Toe had just completed her Masters and convinced him to take some time off and complete the AT with her as a ""graduation"" event. There would be plenty of time to work, but it seemed like the perfect time with no major commitments to take a long hike. I asked about her trail name and she said she didn't like it, but it had come from having blisters on all five toes. We were then talking about trail magic and she was relating how she just loved getting some Little Debbie Swiss Rolls the other day and I said, ""That should be your trail name, Little Debbie"". And with that she had a new trail name that she liked. I didn't even want to ask The Mothly Stud how he got that name, so I let it pass and we all headed out to resume our trail walking. 
The trail meandered up and down until we got to The Priest. Up it climbed and the afternoon had gotten hot and humid. I passed Lilo and Stitch taking a break and then came to the sign for the Priest shelter. I decided to stop there for water and a late lunch. After I got there Little Debbie and The Mothly Stud showed up, and several other southbounders as well. One lady named Iwok was fascinated with trail names and wanted to hear everybody's story. When it came to The Mothly Stud, he said it was a long story. It turned out that a hiker named Cheese Weasel had named him. He had met the couple on the trail and the guy was carrying Five Toes' (Little Debbie) pack for her up a tough incline she was struggling with because of her blisters. Cheese Weasel was wanted to name his the Stud, but he would have nothing of that, that's a way to get verbally abused in a shelter. They were walking along and a moth flew into his ear and he tried a get it out but couldn't, and it kept bugging him as he walked down the trail. Finally the moth flew out with a great buzzing. Cheese Weasel laughed about that and told him I'm going to come up with a trail name for you yet as he passed by them. They continued down the trail a few more miles, and saw a paper note attached to a sign. It was addressed to ""The Mothly Stud, you know who you are"". It contained a poem about the Mothly Stud carrying his ladies pack and went on and on. It was quite a good poem, and with that, he had to accept that he was The Mothly Stud. We all laughed at that story and agreed that was the best we'd ever heard.
Up and over the Priest the three of us walked and talked. It was good to have someone to talk to again. The descent from the Priest is long, rocky, and painful on my feet. When we got to the bottom there were three thru hikers doing trail magic! They had coolers of Coke, beer, donuts, cookies, chips, fruit. We all grabbed a donut and a Coke, thankful for the sugar and fat rush after that 3000 foot descent. The hikers, Flannel, Stardust, and Lupin were taking a few days off in Waynesboro and had decided to come back here and do trail magic for other hikers behind them. Wow! As we talked it turned out that Flannel had already thru hiked the PCT and the CDT, and here he was on the AT about to complete the Triple Crown! As we left we thanked them profusely and Little Debbie and The Mothly Stud set out for the next shelter.
I was too tired to make it up to the next shelter so just walked across the road and crossed the Tye River suspension bridge and set up camp along the river. I didn't even bother to eat dinner I was so tired but was satisfied with the donuts and Coke and a beer from the trail magic. After I set camp I just laid down in my tent to rest. I fell asleep quickly but about 9 pm a ferocious thunderstorm woke me and I zipped up the tent fly. The storm lasted over an hour and just pounded down rain, probably the strongest storm I had been in yet in this tent. It stayed dry and I drifted back to sleep.","Seely - Woodworth Shelter

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536881,"Three Ridges Mountain is the last big climb for the next 900 miles they say. Up 3000 feet from the Tye River, the trail climbs up to 4000 feet and then down to 2600 feet at Reed's Gap. The trail still has significant ups and downs, but more in the range of 1000 feet instead of 3000 feet like the Priest and Three Ridges. I'm looking forward to the coming miles.
I managed to stay dry through the horrific storm last night, but of course everything was soaked or damp. My tent and my pack were soaked, and it seemed like everything I had was damp just from the high humidity. I was to later hear that the storm dumped 4.5 inches of rain on a farm not far from where I was camped. I started the process of hanging things up trying to dry them out a little bit, which was basically fruitless since it was an overcast day and there was no breeze down in this valley. At least some of the water would drip off as I slowly packed up and ate my breakfast. I didn't get going until 10:15, dreading the 3000 foot climb to the top of Three Ridges. There were a number of southbounders coming down the mountain, all looking equally waterlogged. At the turn off for one of the side trails I caught up with one young couple and their almost two year old daughter out for a day hike. They had a child carrier and it reminded me of the hikes my wife and I used to take our two year old daughter on. Patrick and Megan were ex Marine Corp and Navy respectively and were now living in Charlottesville. He was a third year med school student and she was an engineer with civil and environmental engineering degrees. Talk about a power couple! They were really interested in the AT and we talked a long time as their daughter Josie played. Patrick had grown up near these mountains and had hiked most of the trails. Being from Charlottesville they had easy access to the AT and these mountains. We parted company and I continued my climb. Meeting day hikers that are interested in the AT is one of the really fun things you get to do out here and I really enjoy answering their questions.
To me Three Ridges was a lot nicer climb than The Priest. There were several rock outcroppings with some grand views and that makes such a difference. Coming down the back side of Three Ridges the wind started to really pick up and it started to rain. It seems like an everyday occurrence here, around 4 pm you'll get a little rain come through. I had put my pack cover on but didn't bother with a rain jacket until it really started to pour. I passed the shelter turn off and there were several people camped in tents near the trail already. It was only about 6 pm and Reed's Gap was only 1.6 miles away and there was a brewery down the road everyone had been talking about. I continued on, up one more annoying climb to get to Reed's Gap. A number of section hikers passed me going south, heading for the shelter site. I was surprised to see so many this late on a Sunday evening. I got down to Reed's Gap and futilely tried to call the brewery for a pick up. The AT&T cell coverage was bad as usual. A group of three hikers pulled up in a car and they were getting packs out and stuffing them with food. They said they had never backpacked before and were going to climb Three Ridges and The Priest on the AT and then loop back on other trails. I told them for a first time backpack they had certainly picked a tough trail. They were young and ambitious and so wished them well as I tried to get a hitch to the brewery. It took 20 minutes before I was able to finally get a ride down to the brewery. I was expecting a small building stuffed into the side of a mountain, but Devils Backbone brewery turned out to be a huge complex of buildings and seating areas and was a pretty ritzy place. They were supposed to be hiker friendly so I was shocked it was such a nice place. They also specialize in functions, catering and events and hence all the buildings and seating areas for large groups. My burger was great with a price to match, as was my craft beer. They let hikers camp on the property and offer a hiker only breakfast so after dinner I set up my tent in a clearing and settled in for the night. I was glad to be done with the big mountains for a while and looking forward to getting into Waynesboro for resupply and then on to the Shenandoah.","Tye River

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537056,"After last night's gastronomic affair at Devil's Backbone Brewery I was looking forward to their breakfast. I had slept in their ""tenting area"" (read big field out back) and was the only one there. I got up several times at night and was amazed to see stars! I love stargazing and one of my few disappointments on the trail is the lack of clear nights and open areas to see stars if the nights were clear. In contrast with Colorado or Kansas when you almost always see stars, here in the AT its been a rarity. In the morning I got up about 6:45 and started packing up and drying things out. I went over to the pavilion at 8 am and found two other hikers, Barnum and McLovin'. They had slept under cover instead of in the ""tenting area"". We had wifi there so we used the time to catch up with the world while waiting for breakfast. The hiker-only Breakfast at Devils Backbone was absolutely amazing! For $5 they had quiche, a hash brown potato cake, a large sausage (best ever), fresh fruit and a dinner roll, coffee and ice water. We felt like kings eating this bounty and so glad we stayed. The downside is we wouldn't get back to the trail until almost 11, but it was worth it. Before we left I got them to fill my Nalgene bottle with ice water.They dropped us at the trail and we headed toward Waynesboro. Getting this late a start I knew I couldn't make the 19 miles today, but I'd get as far as I could. As I walked, I kept taking sips of my ice water. How I miss ice out here! Ice water is the best!The trail was amazingly level, following the contour of a ridge below the Blue Ridge Parkway. It was pleasant except for the rocks, the rocks continued to kill my feet. Along the way I met up with Gently and Scarface, two hikers from Tasmania. I hadn't seen them since Rice Field Shelter out of Pearisburg and it was good to see them again. They probably win the award for coming the furthest to hike the AT.There were occasional rock outcroppings along this stretch of trail with just incredible views, which further slowed my progress as I stopped to enjoy them. By mid-afternoon it was time for the climb up Humpback mountain. Humpback Mountain was only 800 feet instead of 3000 like we had just been through yesterday. It was a relatively pleasurable climb with some nice views, except for the rocky trail. Over Humpback Mountain and down toward the campsite I was aiming for, the trail remained rocky and I just couldn't make up any time with my sore feet. Part way down some other hikers had stopped for a bear! The bear was about 50 yards away and pawing around in some weeds so my pictures look like a little black smudge in a field of green plants. He was watching us as intently as we were watching him and then just walked away. I finally got to see a bear on this hike! 
Finally about 8 pm I pulled into the campsite. There were several other hikers at this unofficial campsite which I was glad about. There had been reports of bears trying to get into food bags and I liked the concept of safety in numbers. Ironwill and Waldo with his dog Tulip were camped at this spot, another group in another site. I quickly set up my tent and cooked a meal before it got dark. Waynesboro was just 9 miles down the trail so I should easily be there in time for a town lunch, resupply, a shower, and laundry. Then it is on to the Shenandoah!","Reeds Gap

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537393,"We didn't have any bear attacks last night, but I did have a nosebleed attack. I woke up about 1:30 and found that I was having a nosebleed, and frantically started feeling around for my bandana to stop the flow. I get these occasionally in the dry Kansas winter, and not sure what brought it on out here. Trying to deal with it in a small tent with nothing but a cloth bandana was not fun. I eventually hoped out of my tent and went scrounging through my pack for some toilet paper to try to help stop it. As I was dealing with the nosebleed I did get to notice that there were stars again, though the trees blocked and chance to see the various constellations. I finally got the bleeding to stop and crawled back in my tent. Hopefully it wouldn't reoccur. I slept all the way to 7 am, getting some of the best sleep I've had in a while. Ironwill and Waldo were packing up their packs and getting ready to go. I retrieved my food back from the tree I had put it in last night, relieved that bears hadn't messed with it.
After breakfast I packed up and headed down the trail, only 9 miles to Waynesboro, or Wayne's World as I had taken to calling it. Not too far down the trail I saw another bear, about 25 yards away, but moving away from me. By the time I could get my phone out to take a picture he was about 50 yards away and was sitting next to a tree just watching me. We watched each other for a while and then I moved on. My second bear! 
I arrived at the Paul C. Wolfe Memorial Shelter about 11 am and took a break and got some water. This was a really nice shelter and had a beautiful steam in front of it. It would have been a good stop for the night. As I was eating a snack a day hiker pulled in and introduced himself as Sharkey. He was a local and had thru hiked the AT 3 times already. We talked for a while and he passed on some suggestions and tips for up the trail. 
I headed out, only 5 miles to go and I would be eating people food again. The trail went up and followed a ridge, and was mercifully level for quite a while. This is what I had always imagined the AT should be - a level trail, no rocks, a cool breeze, dappled sunlight shining through the trees, views down into the valley, and if they could only add few playful bears and a deer or two the picture would be complete. There were no more bears but I did start to hear highway sounds and knew I was getting close to the road. I popped out into Rockfish Gap and what a change! There was the Blue Ridge Parkway with a bunch of Harleys driving by, the entrance to the interstate, a hotel, several abandoned buildings and a trailer advertising Kings Gourmet Popcorn. It kind of assaults your senses, and yet excites you. I called the B&B where I would be staying and headed for King's Gourmet Popcorn. There were a number of locals there as well as a few hikers including Ironwill and Waldo. I ordered a hot dog, a Coke, and a popcorn and joined Ironwill and Waldo at their picnic table. Waldo had twisted an ankle coming down the mountain so they were going to zero here. I hadn't decided whether to zero here or head into the Shenandoah tomorrow yet, but would see how much I could get done this afternoon. The B&B owner, Bill, showed up and I loaded my stuff into his vehicle. Bill gave me the scenic tour of Waynesboro to orient me on where the hiker essentials were -restaurants, laundry, post office, grocery store. We pull into the Tree Street Inn B&B and it was beautiful. This is not a typical hiker stay, this house was majestic! With a pool, gardens, elegantly furnishings and decorations, it was like it was out of a magazine! Bill showed me to my room and I plopped my stuff down. The first thing I needed to do was get to the post office before it closed, a short 4 block walk. My daughter had sent me a care package and it turned out to be quite a bonanza - coconut chocolate chip cookies, some candies and gum, and a picture my granddaughter had ""colored"" for me!
Back to the Inn I took a long shower and got my laundry ready. I had already decided that tomorrow would be a zero day. I wasn't going to be able to get everything done this afternoon and this was too nice a place to leave after one night. I went down to the pool and took a relaxing swim and laid in the sun. It felt so good! After a while it clouded up and started to rain. I went in and grabbed my laundry and walked to the laundromat, about half a mile away. The rain had only lasted a few minutes so it was a pleasant walk seeing old Waynesboro. I got my laundry going and went across the street to a pizza place where I had some of the best garlic breadsticks I've ever had. It felt really good to be in a town once again, warm bread and clean clothes!
I walked back to the Inn and dropped off my laundry. I then walked back another 5 blocks to downtown Waynesboro to the famous Ming's Chinese Buffet. It's a typical AYCE Chinese Buffet but is a legend in the AT community - Georgia to Ming's they say. It was good, not amazing, but it did give me an opportunity to sample a bunch of different items. I walked back to the Inn in the dark and absolutely crashed. My belly was more than full, I was in an elegant inn, and tomorrow would be a zero day. Life was good on the trail.","Stealth campsite on Humpback Mountain

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537394,"Tree Streets Inn was a supremely comfortable place to rest up. The rooms are very comfortable and it is very quiet. I awoke this morning, got dressed, and went down for breakfast around 8 am. They serve breakfast at 8:30 am, so I spent some time looking around the house. The owners, the Aldridges, have done a beautiful job decorating their B&B and have an extensive library. The other hiker staying there came down and introduced himself as Westy. We shared a little of our histories and ultimately got to talking about gear and food and how to lighten our loads. Westy had zeroed yesterday and would be taking off today. 
Breakfast was served in their formal dining room and we had blueberry pancakes, sausage, yogurt, homemade granola, and fruit. It was a wonderful breakfast. 
I got a ride with Bill to the Outfitter when he took Westy back to the trail. I wanted to see if they had any suggestions for my blistered feet, and to pick up some gas for my stove. The Outfitter didn't have any better suggestions other than what I was doing, so I would carry on. It was 1.4 miles back to town from the outfitter so I walked back to town. It seemed so easy without a pack.
Once in town I stopped at the Kroger to do my food resupply. I tried to resist buying too much as I would be hiking through the Shenandoah next and there were Waysides to get food as well as camp stores with limited food supplies. Back at the Inn I spread all my food and all my gear on the bed and decided what to take, what to mail home, and what to donate to the hiker box at the Inn. I decided to mail back some more cold weather gear including my down jacket, pant legs, and long sleeve shirts. I was counting on summer weather for the next 900 miles and would just have T-shirts and shorts. At the last minute I decided to keep one long sleeve shirt, but bundled the rest up for mailing.
Gear and food sorted I did something I haven't done in a very long time, I laid down and took a nap.
When I woke up mid afternoon I walked down to the post office and mailed my stuff home, then walked around downtown Waynesboro for a bit. For dinner I went to the Green Leaf Grill which several people had recommended. It was a great choice and I had a nice meal and a couple glasses of good wine. I walked back to the Inn and spent some time catching up with the news from home and catching up on trail journal entries. 
It was a nice quiet zero day and a chance for my feet to recover some. I also felt like I got to know Waynesboro a bit, a place to come back to on future visits to the Shenandoah.","Rockfish Gap

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537785,"It was hard to leave the comfort and serenity of Tree Streets Inn, but I was anxious to get going through Shenandoah National Park. My feet had recovered a great deal with a day of rest, so I was glad that I took a zero day yesterday. After breakfast and goodbyes, Bill drove me back to Rockfish Gap to resume my march up the trail. There is a simple self registration sign along the trail where you register to camp in the backcountry of the National Park. I was now in the Shenandoah that I had been looking forward to!The trail began doing a fairly gradual ascent through the morning and then a steep descent into the first gap and road crossing of Skyline Drive. At the gap there was a wait styrofoam cooler marked ""Trail Magic""! Score!! Even though I was fairly fresh from a short morning and two nights in town, the Trail Magic was SO appreciated. It looked like it had just been left as the ice had hardly melted but contained Cokes, juice coolers, Snickers, Reese's, donuts, and a number of other snacks. Another hiker who introduced himself as Gnome and I grabbed some Cokes and candy. A bunch of other hikers started showing up and digging in as well. There we all stood, fresh into Shenandoah and most of us had just zeroed in Waynesboro, just soaking in the love of someone who had left trail magic. We all started introducing ourselves - Ukelady, Wet Tent, O.D., Quasimodo, Booty Call, and Ranger - the other Ranger! We finally met! He was much younger and shorter than me as people had described, but to add to the coincidence he was from Olathe, KS too! He actually lives about 4 miles from where I do. We took our picture and then all started heading up the trail. We ascended up past a big complex of microwave towers and then down into a gap and up and over Little Calf Mountain. Little Calf Mountain was a grassy bald and so we had some nice views. The trail then went down a gap and up and over Calf Mountain. I descended down to Calf Mountain shelter turnoff and had to decide whether to stay there or go on. It was a 13 mile dry stretch, so I'd have to carry a lot of water. Since it was only 4, I decided to push on and look for a stealth campsite somewhere. I tanked up with all the water I could at the next spring and pushed on for another 4 or 5 miles. At a road side crossing O.D. had stopped and there was a nice stone wall to sit on, so I stopped also and ate a cold supper. I didn't want to use up my water cooking a meal. Ascending Turk Mountain I found a really nice spot and set up my tent. It had been a rather easy day but looking back, I also felt the views that we had seen were rather unremarkable. Here in Shenandoah, without the big climbs we weren't rewarded with the big views. Like most things in life, the harder you work the bigger the reward.","Waynesboro

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537787,"It doesn't happen out here, but I finally had a sunset you would call Spectacular! After a very long day, a dash for people food, and a long climb back up to my perch, I had the perfect viewpoint for this sunset.
The day started on Turk Mountain, my tent site had worked quite well and there was even a chill in the morning air. My big goal for the day was to get to the Loft Mountain Wayside for dinner. I was dreaming of a Blackberry shake, a hamburger, and fries. I didn't get a very early start but finally got packed and left the campsite about 8:30. There were gradual ups and downs almost all day with no great views. Booty Call passed me as I was heading for the Blackrock Shelter for lunch and water and we talked as we climbed. She was from Ottawa and had come down to do a section for a hiking vacation. She was really interested in the whole thru-hiker culture and was thinking she might try to meet up with some of the people she met in the New Hampshire AT. At the shelter Ukelady and Breeze were finishing up there lunch and WalkJog was struggling with her pack. I had lunch and got water, and with 8.5 miles to go headed out toward the Wayside. Ukelady and Booty Call had already taken off and they were going to try to make the next shelter over 13 miles away. Ukelady wanted to do a marathon, 26 miles. The trail went up Blackrock Mtn. which was a jumble of loose rock. My wife and I had climbed it a couple of years ago when we were visiting Shenandoah by car. I hated to waste time climbing it but can't resist a peak or a good view. After Blackrock Mtn. the trail descended to Dundo Picnic Area and then up Loft Mountain. I met Booty Call walking south and she had decided to stay at Loft MountIn Csmpground. It was one of the big Park Service campgrounds with RVs and car campers and she figured she could hitch a ride back to her car easier there. We wished each other luck and went along our way.
Hurrying down the trail I met Rosy Eagle, a 74 year old who had just finished his SOBO (southbound) hike, at Springer Mtn. He had returned to Shenandoah to finish a few miles that were closed when he went through due to forest fires. I congratulated him and headed back down the trail intent on getting to the Wayside before they closed. It was almost 6 pm and once I got to the turnoff there would be another 0.6 miles to get to the Wayside. At the trail turnoff I spied a nice stealth campsite with one tent already on it. I put my pack down on my groundsheet to claim a space and headed down the side trail for the Wayside without my pack. It was a great decision in that respect because the trail was very, very steep. I was almost running down with no pack and wanting to make sure I got there before they closed. In my worst nightmare I would arrive 30 minutes before their 7 pm closing but they say, ""Sorry hon, the grill is closed, but we have these packages of freeze-dried food we can sell you"".
I did get down there at 6:30, and the grill was not closed. I ordered a hamburger, a hot dog, fries, and a blackberry shake. I wish I could say it was as good as in my dreams, but well, it was pretty good! I filled up a water bladder that I had brought down and headed back up to the top of Loft Mountain. Without a pack the trail wasn't too bad and in 15 minutes I was back on top. I set up my tent, hung my food bag, and then retired to the rocks at the overlook. And there I sat, watching my sunset, taking pictures, with a full belly and very sore feet. And it was a spectacular sunset.","Stealth campsite on Turk Mountain

I kept thinking I was giving my sore feet a few extra minutes to recover. Geo and Fast Eddy packed up quickly and were down the trail before I emerged from my tent.

I started tearing my tent down and packing up, eating breakfast, sorting through my food for the day, brushing my teeth, and doctoring my blisters. I should be getting faster at my morning ritual but it generally takes me an hour and a half.
I started down Loft Mountain and came to an overlook. It was a good view but the sun was shining right at me and it wouldn't make a good picture. I turned to head down the trail and noticed I was standing next to a massive flowering bush that was covered in bees. It was a pollinator's dream and there were several kinds of bees and butterflies going from flower to flower, all heavily laden with pollen. I watched this spectacle for about 10 minutes and tried to get some good bee pictures. Lilo and Stitch came up just as I was leaving. They had gotten up at 5 am and already put in 6 miles. Beasts!
The trail today was full of ups and downs, a little steeper than the past couple of days, but generally in the +/- 800 feet range. I had lunch at Pinefield Hut and ran into Breeze and Xtra-tuff. A ridge runner named Blissful came in shortly after and she was trying to help a German hiker named Joules who was struggling. After lunch there was another climb up Weaver Mountain and then down into Simmons Gap. Out of Simmons Gap there was another climb and then a descent to an overlook. At the overlook was the 900 mile milestone! Some hikers had fashioned a 900 sign out of sticks marking the milestone. WarCry, Salt and Pepper (a German couple), SeaDog, Pickles, and Bullseye were hanging around taking a break and taking their picture with the mile marker. Milestones like this are great celebrations, and only 1289 more miles to go! 
Coming out of Smith Roach Gap a few miles later I saw my first 2 bear cubs and their mama. A cub was climbing up a tree about 20 yards away from me when I first saw him. The cub climbed down and ran down the hillside. I didn't see the mother at first until she moved from behind the tree and ran down with the cub about 50 yards down the hill and stopped to watch me. I didn't see the second cub at first until it came sliding down the tree and ran down the hill to join its mother and the other cub. Seeing the cubs romping around was a real treat for the day. 
A couple of day hikers named Lidia and Vash came up behind me not long after and had a lot of questions about hiking the AT. Once again I had great fun answering their questions. When the got to their car they offered me a cold water and I said, ""Yes, trail magic!"". They asked what trail magic was and I got to give them the full explanation about trail magic. They were so excited to think about doing that on future trips and wanting to be ""trail angels"". Converts!! (They also gave me a Hershey Bar :-))
It was a short 1.6 miles up to Hightop Hut. There was a good crowd there but the shelter itself was pretty open so I took a spot. At the shelter that night were Geo and Fast Eddy, Breeze, Xtra-tuff, Christina, Tenacious, Salt and Pepper, SeaDog, Pickle, and Bullseye. It was a fun crowd with a lively conversation going as everyone cooked their dinner. We were all 900 milers now, and that gave everyone a sense of accomplishment.","Stealth campsite on Loft Mountain

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538098,"I had a reservation for a cabin at Skyland resort and almost 17 miles to get there so I made sure I got an early start. I was on the trail by 7:40am and had a relatively easy climb up Bearfence Mountain and Hazeltop Mountain in the morning. By lunchtime I was at Big Meadows Wayside and enjoying another meal of people food. Big Meadows Wayside was outstanding and had a great menu and table service. I met up with Slinger and ended up eating a fried chicken and mashed potato dinner! Slinger had a good looking hamburger and the famous Shenandoah Blackberry Milkshake.
After lunch the trail went up a small climb and came out at a beautiful outcropping. Along the way I ran into the Mothly Stud and we got to walk together for a few miles and catch up since we last saw each other. Mothly posed for me at a rock outcropping and I got one of my best pictures of the Shenandoah. We also met Mango and Sunrise, a couple be had hiked with three years before when they started hiking the AT! Talk about chance meetings! They were finishing up the AT this year after three years of hiking long sections. We continued on to the shelter where Mothly was meeting up with Little Debbie, and then I continued on to Skyland resort.
The trail was great for most of the afternoon and followed a ridge providing great views of the valley below. This was probably the easiest day of hiking yet! As we got within a few miles of Skyland the trail got rocky again which killed my feet. By the time I got into Skyland my feet were aching and I was ready for a shower and a nice meal. I had reserved a cabin and took a long hot shower, put on my clean set of clothesline as not to not offend the tourists too badly and went up to the Pollock Dining Room for dinner. The view was fantastic, the wine excellent, and even the steak was done quite nicely. I finished off my meal with their ""signature"" Blackberry Ice Cream Pie! Superb!! After dinner I went into the bar where they had live music and met up with Foxtrot, Snacks, and FunGuy and his parents. We had a great time sharing trail stories and life stories.

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539899,"On Sunday I flew down from Boston to Washington D. C. where I spent the night at my friend Alex's house. Alex is another aviation friend and he offered to fly me back out to the trail in his plane on Monday. After making a grocery run in the morning to resupply, I packed everything back up and we headed for the airport. 
Montgomery County airport is located just north of Washington and they have a great restaurant at the airport where we had lunch before departing. Once we took off we headed west for Harper's Ferry in order to circle the ATC headquarters and then south to Front Royal. What would be an hour and a half drive at best was less than a 30 minute flight with no traffic! General aviation at its finest!!!
After landing I called the Grateful Greenpeace Guy again for a shuttle to his hostel, and he showed up in just a few minutes. As I threw my pack in his van a voice called out, ""Is that Ranger?"" To my amazement One Hit Wonder was sitting in the van heading for the hostel as well. In addition, a young woman was in the van and it turned out to be Caroline, who I met on my first morning back in North Carolina at Carter Gap Shelter. One Hit Wonder had been off the trail for 4 weeks with knee problems, and had a new trail name - Lazarus. (He's back from the dead). Caroline also had a trail name now - Puppy Mill. I was confused by that one but she got it the day she met me because she left behind a guy she had been walking with. He was so sad about being left that he got the name Pound Puppy, and she was now Puppy Mill.
Lazarus and Puppy Mill were staying at the hostel and trying to get into the doctor to get some of their moving parts looked at. I was going to try to get a few miles in so I took off once I got to the hostel and walked the half mile blue blaze trail back to the AT. I was once again northbound on the AT and almost immediately passed the sign for the northern boundary of Shenandoah National Park. I was done with the Shenandoah! It was less than a mile to the first shelter and to my surprise Karma came along behind me. It was a fun reunion, I hadn't seen her since Fontana. Through the magic of Facebook and Instagram I had been following her and her trail family as they cruised up the trail behind me. Karma and her compatriots were doing huge miles and were probably averaging 22+ miles per day.
We made it to the shelter just before a thunderstorm hit and found Alice there eating her dinner. Another nice surprise! Alice, Karma, and Lazarus were half the fun trail family I met back at Sassafras Gap, North Carolina in early May. Now they almost out of Virginia!
A couple of other hikers were also at the shelter, Cruzer and Dozer. We all claimed some space and prepared for the thunderstorm to hit. As the rain started coming down an older couple showed up, and really needed a spot in the shelter as they didn't carry a tent to save weight. We all squeezed in a little more and made room for them. More and more hikers kept showing up as the rain came down. The shelter was maxed out so some set up their tents and some chose to move on and head into Front Royal for a hotel.
As we talked, we found that the older couple, named Morning Song and Towhee, were section hiking the AT and were close to finishing it all after 15 years. Their daughter and her family and their son had joined them on this section, their final section of Virginia. They were a great family and very supportive of their parents/grandparents goal.
The rain finally stopped around 9 and we fell into our sleeping bags. I had only done a little more than a mile today, but it was good to be back working toward the goal, the goal of walking to Maine.","Front Royal Hostel
",Tom Floyd Shelter,"Jun 27, Mon",1.40
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540060,"I woke up at 4:30 to the sounds of Cruzer and Dozer packing up. I was impressed that they were going to get such an early start. Then they just sat there. I asked them later why they didn't get going after they packed up, they said they were waiting for enough daylight - well then why did you get up so early??
I got up around 5:30 and went and ate breakfast and packed up. I talked to Morning Song and Towhee as they were up as well and got more of their story. They had started section hiking the AT when they were 60 and were trying to finish by the time they were 75. They are 74 now and have about 300 miles left. They just hiked Mount Katahdin and the 100 mile wilderness with the friends they started doing this with 14 years ago. Their friends were done now, but they still had this section in Virginia and sections in Vermont and southern Maine to do. I think they'll make it! They are truly young at heart!
I left the shelter at 6:30 and made good time down to the road that went to Front Royal. I didn't need to stop so continued on back up a small 800 foot climb to Mosby Camp. For the next few days the terrain will undulate between 1000 and 2000 feet, much lower, and hotter, than the 3000 to 4000 foot elevations of the Shenandoah.
The highlight of the day was lunch at the Jim and Molly Denton shelter. The shelter is beautiful with a big deck with an ""Adirondack-style"" couch on the deck. It also had a solar shower that wasn't getting much solar under the trees. But it was cool and refreshing being spring water fed, and I was able to wash away some of the sweat from the morning's hike. Afterwards I sat on the deck's ""couch"" and soaked up the sunshine and dried off using solar power.
It was just three more miles to I-66 underpass and then 1.2 miles on the road to a restaurant in Linden, VA. I decided to go the extra miles and get an early dinner, air conditioning and cold drinks during the heat of the afternoon. I justified that by saying I wouldn't have to cook dinner and could walk later into the evening. I walked part of it and managed to get rides for part of it so the extra walking wasn't too bad. I've noticed that the further north you go it has gotten harder to get a ride by hitchhiking.
When I got back to the trailhead, Sunset and several other hikers were camped there and they were doing trail magic. I guzzled down one more soda and set off for the shelter 2.5 miles away. When I got there it was quite crowded but I managed to snag the last good tent site. I camped next to Poodle and Hyrax from Iowa. It was good to have Midwesterners to talk to. I was also glad to see that Morning Song and Towhee and their crew made it in. They have just 9 more miles to finish their Virginia section. I hope they can finish the New England sections as planned. I'll look forward to seeing their names in the A.T. Journeys list of 2000 milers for 2017! What an inspiration!","Tom Floyd Shelter
",Manassas Gap Shelter,"Jun 28, Tue",14.60
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540465,"The air cooled down considerably last night and I was able to sleep really well. I woke about 6:30 and tore down my tent and packed up my gear quickly and walked down to the shelter to eat my breakfast. Morning Song, Towhee, and the rest of their family where already down there eating breakfast. They made room for me at the picnic table and I enjoyed listening to their conversation. It turns out that they were all bird ""experts"" and got very excited talking about their bird sitings or various bird calls. Their enthusiasm reminded me of my grandfather, an avid birder. This was their last day on their Virginia section and so I wished them well as I left for the trail.
I took off at 8 am and the cool air made a huge difference in my walking speed, and enjoyment. I made really good time (for me) and covered the first nine miles in under four hours. The trail passed through Sky Meadows State Park and I found that section particularly beautiful as the trail finally got away from the trees and passed through numerous high meadows. As I continued on I thought that I might actually be able to get to the 1000 mile mark until ... until I came to the roller coaster. There is a sign proclaiming to hikers that they are about to enter the famous ""roller coaster"", and to enjoy the ride. The roller coaster is 13.5 miles of tightly packed ascents and descents, much of it rocky.
The roller coaster definitely slowed my progress but by 7pm I was at Mile 999. Decision time - go on or stay at the shelter nearby. I decided to go on; I really wanted to make the 1000 mile milestone, and it had already been 20 miles for the day. I was hot, tired, sweaty, and running low on energy. If I camped, I would be fresh in the morning for the milestone, and somehow it seemed to me that it wouldn't have meant as much. I struggled up one last hill at finally got to the 1000 mile point. It was just a small simple wood sign that said ""1000"", not even ""1000 Miles"" or ""GA - 1000 miles"". There was no one else around. In fact I had only seen two thru hikers all day and a half dozen day hikers. So I took my picture with the sign selfie style, which I hate. I always look goofy. 
I continued on up the hill and back down. I could have camped at the top as there was a nice stealth campsite, but there was the Bears Den Hostel only 2.5 miles away. And at the hostel they served pizza with your stay! And ice cream! So off I went, 2.5 more miles of the roller coaster. I passed several people camping and a couple more day hikers, but I was the only thru hiker left on the trail.
By the time I got to the hostel it was almost 9 and getting dark. Bears Den is famous, a hostel owned by the ATC and operated by the Potomac ATC. It is an old stone castle like structure built on top of a mountain. A doctor built in in the 1920's as his vacation retreat, and after numerous ownership changes it ended up in the hands of the ATC. I checked in. I was exhausted after 23 miles in 12.5 hours. This was my longest day yet. Some of the younger hikers routinely do 25+ miles a day. Not me.
I got my bunk, showered, threw in laundry, and selected a frozen pizza to cook. There were probably 20 other hikers in for the night milling around talking, eating, watching TV. Bears Den is a really clean, we'll run hostel. They frequently host groups and retreats. The manager said they were already booked for most weekends in the fall and winter. I can see why, it's a nice place.
I finally fell into my bunk around 11, exhausted but clean and full. The 1000 mile milestone meant a lot to me today. I'm still not even half way to Maine, but I am 1000 miles from Springer Mtn, GA. And that's a long way.","Manassas Gap Shelter
",Bears Den Hostel,"Jun 29, Wed",23
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540466,"Even though I was exhausted when I pulled into the hostel, I didn't sleep very well. There was a box fan in the bunk room that kept me awake and I kept fighting to try to go to sleep. I finally did but woke up early and went to the kitchen to make my breakfast. The standard fare at the hostel is make your own pancakes. I scavenged a little milk to drink but was really wishing for an ice cold glass of orange juice.
I took off about nine and didn't plan to do too many miles today. Before I left Bears Den I grabbed my uneaten gelato from the freezer and double wrapped it in aluminum foil to insulate it. A perfect mid morning snack. 
Harpers Ferry was 20 miles away and I didn't want to get there after 5 and have the ATC office and post office be closed. My plan was to get close so I could get there early in the morning, get my picture, my mail picked up, get some lunch in town and move on to Maryland.
It was cool again this morning and it felt really good to walk. I still had several miles of the roller coaster but it was so much easier in the cool morning air and having rested. After an hour or so of walking I found a rocky overlook and pulled out my gelato, pistachio gelato. I sat in the warm sun on the rocks, savoring my gelato, as several other hikers came by, and they looked at me with disdain, and a little jealousy.
Shortly thereafter I came to the West Virginia/Virginia border where Castaway and Perry were sitting. It wasn't very prominent and we would end up walking along the border most of the day- left foot in West Virginia, right foot in Virginia. There was a nice overlook at the top of the climb and we got some good pictures. For the rest of the afternoon the trail was fairly level and I kept leapfrogging with FloMo and Monkey Leg, Castaway and Perry, and Songbird and Badger. The air was cool, the sun shining, and the trail was fairly level hiking along a high ridge. A good way to end Virginia. I stopped at the David Lesser Shelter for a late lunch and water. While the trail had been mercifully level, there weren't any water sources along that ridge. The spring was 0.3 miles down from the shelter, a steep descent and climb with a bladder of water. At the shelter FloMo and Monkey Leg were eating lunch, as well as another young hiker ""2.0"".
I only had about 3 more miles to go to WV 9 highway and there was a convenience store only 0.3 off the trail. My plan was to make that for dinner and then hike toward Harpers Ferry and find a campsite. Coming down toward WV 9 was a little emotional, I was nearing completion of the Virginia section and warm memories were flooding over me. The sun was getting lower and the town of Charles Town, WV was visible to the west. I reached WV 9 and found the Welcome to West Virginia sign and took a picture, as well as the Virginia historical sign. Virginia had been good to me with many friends that had met up with me and provided me a ride, a room, a meal and a hot shower, airplane rides, not to mention a beer or two.
I met up with Castaway and Perry again at the Sweet Springs store and got a fried chicken dinner. Not bad for convenience store food! There was a nice couple that pulled up as we were eating and offered us fruit for trail magic, thank you!!
The sun was getting low as I took off for the trail. The trail was easy and my belly was full, probably too full. I passed up several stealth campsites and finally found one that I though looked good. The Yogi's were camped there and I set up my tent and hung my food bag quickly as it was getting dark. I ended up doing 17 miles and was only 3 miles from Harpers Ferry, a good day of hiking.","Bears Den Hostel

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540467,"I had a tough time sleeping, it was too hot in my tent to get into my sleeping bag, too cool to just lay on top of it. When I finally did get to sleep I ended up ""sleeping in"". The Yogis were up early and packed up to get into Harpers Ferry while I slept in a little. By the time I had packed up it was 8:45, but I was only 3 miles into Harpers Ferry and I just wanted to time it right for me to go to the ATC office and get lunch. The trail was easy and mostly downhill. After a mile or so the trail turned sharply downhill and left the Virginia border for good. I was hoping there would be a good trail sign announcing that we had left Virginia , but I didn't see one. The trail descended toward the Shenandoah River and a busy highway, passed under the highway and over onto the bridge to cross the Shenandoah. At the bridge someone had left a cooler of fruit for trail magic, and I bet it was the young couple who had given us fruit last night at the convenience store. Crossing the Shenandoah was exhilarating - the curved bridge, the wind, the noise from the traffic, the sun shining on the river below, all added to the feeling that you were triumphantly marching into Harpers Ferry, the ""psychological halfway point"" of the AT. The real halfway point is another 75 miles north in Pennsylvania, but this was the home of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.
In Harpers Ferry the trail leaves the highway and takes you into a quiet bluff overlooking the Shenandoah. Once again the forest knocked back the highway noise and you feel insulated from the modern world. There were houses 50 feet above you, a whole town, but you felt like you were back in the woods. A blue blaze side trail points the way to the ATC and I climbed to the top of the bluff and I'm into the town. The trail passes through historical Storer College grounds, which was a college set up that would allow people of all races to attend college after the Civil War. There were numerous signs explaining the Civil War history of Harpers Ferry and the John Brown raid as you walk towards the ATC office, a lot of great history here. 
As I arrived at the ATC office there were a dozen or so hikers relaxing outside and several others inside looking at displays, charging electronic devices, and using the free wifi. I got my picture taken in front of the ATC sign and added it to the thick binder of hiker's pictures. I was number 341, that was the number of section hikers so far that intended to complete the trail this year. The thru hikers were around 1100 so far, and I would have dearly loved to have been counted in their numbers, but it was not to be. The ATC does a purely voluntary count of north bound and south bound thru hikers, section hikers, flip flop hikers, etc. in order to get a sense of the traffic on the trail. I could have said I was a thru hiker if I had wanted to; it's voluntary how and if you declare yourself, but I thought purity of their metrics was important. I had come to grips with the fact that I wouldn't be thru hiking this year, but there was still that desire.
Let me put a shameless plug in here for the ATC. If you can get a chance to come near Harpers Ferry, please do stop in. They have fascinating displays on the AT, the ladies that work there are wonderful, and it is so interesting to look through the hiker logs to see all the pictures and names of the hikers. I paged through the book to check out the group of hikers I had been hiking with to see when they came through, and to get to find out what their real names are. As a hiker, you rarely learn a person's real name, you only know them by their trail name. It's only if you become closer friends and want to connect by email or social media that you trade real names. 
One of the fascinating displays at the ATC is the full relief model of the whole trail. It's probably 12 feet long and of large enough scale that you can see individual mountains you have climbed over, and are to encounter. It's really impressive!
The ATC is a nonprofit organization so if you have some charitable giving and you are looking for a good charity this year, please consider looking into the ATC. Their website (www.atc.org) can give you information on their mission and has an easy way to take your money. 
With my picture taken, I headed for the post office to retrieve a mail drop and get some lunch. I returned to the trail the way I came and took the AT into the old historic town. I chose to eat at a restaurant with outside seating to spare the tourists my hiker odors, and sat there drinking a beer, eating a steak sandwich and soaking in the sunshine. I had made it to Harpers Ferry, 1022 miles from the start of the trail!
After lunch I wandered into a few shops and looked at some of the historical buildings. I would have loved to spend more time doing the full tourist thing but I wanted to get across the river and into Maryland. I'll be back to Harpers Ferry someday later as a tourist.
I crossed the bridge over the Potomac River and was in my sixth state on the trail. The AT follows the historic Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) canal and is a wide bike path now. It was getting really hot and there were a lot of tourists tubing in the Potomac and I was tempted to hop in for a swim. HoweverI also saw some of the creeks draining into the Potomac and wasn't too confident how healthy that would be. I continued on to the Weverton Cliffs parking lot and it had been really hot walking on that bike path. A local was hoping in his car as I was crossing the parking lot and he asked if I needed a ride to the hostel. Hostel? I had planned on pushing on to the first shelter, but it suddenly sounded really good to stay in a hostel. And I remembered that the trail guide said they can get pizza delivered there. So I hoped in his car and went to the Harpers Ferry Hostel. It was a really nice hostel and there were a number of bicyclists there riding the C&O canal trail, as well as people in cars and AT hikers. It was an interesting mix of people. I got my bunk, took a shower, did laundry, and ordered a pizza. The hostel had a huge kitchen and living room and I got coaxed into a card game while I was waiting for my pizza, and then a chess match. I was thoroughly enjoying my snap decision not to push on to the shelter.
That night some of the guests got a campfire going and we roasted marshmallows and did s'mores. It was interesting hearing about the different adventures that had brought people to this hostel. For the first time in two months the conversation wasn't strictly about the AT. And that was a little eye opening, because you get immersed in it.
I headed for my bunk around 10 pm and spent a little time catching up on trail journal entries. I was badly behind and needed to get more diligent about keeping up. I was now in Maryland and pushing on. The next objective was the AT Midpoint, 70 miles away. That will be another satisfying milestone.","Stealth Campsite near Harpers Ferry

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540786,"I woke up about 4am and was really, really hungry. Being in the hostel it was easy enough to wander into the kitchen and scrounge up something to eat. Nachos looked to be my best option so I microwaved some tortilla chips, cheese, and salsa. Voila! 4am Nachos! I went back to bed but couldn't go back to sleep so I was ready for the real hostel breakfast at 7:30. This hostel put out a nice spread of things you could cook yourself - turkey bacon, eggs, pancakes, fruit, cereals, and especially orange juice! I had been craving orange juice with ice! It's funny what you come into town craving; sometimes it's a cheeseburger, sometimes pizza, sometimes a glass of wine, but this time it was orange juice with ice.
After breakfast I managed to get a ride to the trailhead from one of the other guests and I was on my way. The first climb takes you up 1000 feet to Weverton Cliffs, a really nice overlook of the Potomac River. I had done this hike before as a day hike when I was in Washington DC on business. It's one of my favorite hikes in the DC area with beautiful views of the Potomac River with its rapids and the mountains in Virginia to the south.
After the Weverton Cliffs the trail is relatively flat for many miles until arriving at Gathland State Park. Gathland was the home of George Albert Townsend that wrote his books and articles under the pen name ""Gath"" during the Civil War. He was a war correspondent and ended up building a mountain home here after the war, as well as building an arch as a memorial to war correspondents. This was also the site of several battles during the Civil War and there are a couple of buildings with historical artifacts and displays as well as an exuberant docent named Randy that loved to tell visitors about the battle of Crampton's Gap and the Battle of South Mountain. 
Along the way to Gathland I ran into a day hiker named Denny. He was very interested in the AT and hoped to section hike it all some day. I told him about my favorite hiker couple, Towhee and Morning Song, and how they were hiking it over 15 years in their 60's and 70's. I use their experience often as an example of what a person can do on the trail. I hope Denny can make his dream come true too.
After Gathland there was another small climb up and over South Mountain and into Dahlgren Backpack Campground. Dahlgren was a big grassy area with bathrooms and showers. Pretty ""deluxe"" for a backpack campground! It is meant to be for backpackers only but there was a big family there that had hauled in lots of stuff and set up a little tent city. That was one of the disadvantages of being so close to a road. One of the advantages was that we were able to call in to a pizza place and they would deliver to the trailhead. A section hiker named Rich and I called in an order and we were soon eating people food for dinner. 
Rich was a Southwest pilot and was hoping to take a leave of absence to do a thru hike next year. Like my conversation with Denny, the trail can have a powerful pull on those who hear her call. For those that don't hear her call, it's hard to understand why someone would want to take off six months of their life to do a walk in the woods for thousands of miles, up and down some of the toughest terrain in the lower 48. It is a journey, it is an odyssey, it is a y, it is a life goal, it is one of the few ""wilderness"" adventures you can still do in America. (And still eat pizza pretty regularly!) And it is different for every person who hikes it. For the trail is inside you as much as it is a place to walk. And for those who choose to walk it, they make of it what they need it to be.","Harpers Ferry Hostel

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540787,"The Dahlgren Camp worked out better than I expected, the pizza delivery was very satisfying and the noisy family didn't keep me awake, I fell asleep quite quickly. I did wake up in the middle of the night and after doing some internet searching booked a train ticket from Harrisburg, PA to Boston for the 7th of July. I was getting off the trail again for a few days to attend my grandson's baptism back on Cape Cod. With that ticket booked I just needed to find a shuttle ride from wherever I ended up on the 6th to Harrisburg.
I departed camp around 8:20 am and after a couple of miles came to the Washington monument of Washington County Maryland. This stone tower was built by the local citizens of Boonesboro in 1827 to commemorate the life of George Washington. It is a simple tower but a marvel that in those times the citizens of a small rural community could come together together to build a memorial to President Washington. The tower was used by Union troops in the Civil War and has a great view of the valley below it.
After the monument the trail continued over fairly level terrain through a green tunnel of trees. After about 3 miles we popped out onto a residential street and went between a couple of houses to the I-70 overpass. The highway noise is deafening compared to the quiet of the forest, and I feel sorry for the people living in those houses being subjected to that noise 24 hours a day. The overpass itself is a fenced in arch, with one end covered in vines giving it the appearance of a green tunnel - a Tunnel to the North.
Near the I-70 overpass there was a parking lot and a sign to Annapolis Rocks, a popular destination for day hikers. There was a huge increase in the number of day hikers, and accentuated by it being a holiday weekend. Annapolis Rocks provided a picturesque outcropping of rocks with great views of the valley below and had many day hikers. I stopped there for lunch and filled up with water from the spring. A mile past Annapolis Rocks was another rock outcropping, Black Rock cliffs. Black Rock Cliffs had a similar view to Annapolis Rocks, just a little further down the valley. A father and daughter were there on a day hike and were interested in hearing about the thru hiking experience.
After Black Rocks I passed the Pogo Memorial Shelter. A day hiker warned me that I was about to hit the rocks on the trail. The next mile or so was brutal and these rocks were just a foreshadowing of the infamous rocks through Pennsylvania. After passing the rocky section I came out on highway MD 17. I had planned on going into Smithsburg, MD for a quick resupply and hopefully get some dinner. There were several road crossings that could take me into Smithsburg and I took off my pack to pull out my map to look for the best one. No sooner than I did a passing car screeched to a stop and a kind young couple asked if I needed a ride into town. ""Well yes, yes I do"". Their names were John and Shirley and she said that often gave hikers rides. They took me into town and dropped me off at the local Food Lion, and there was a Chinese restaurant right next door. Shirley said that they would even swing back by in an hour or so in case I was having difficulty getting a ride back to the trail. Wow! Such thoughtfulness!
I made a quick run through Food Lion and picked up some food for breakfast and some fresh fruit. I was still well stocked for dinners since I had been managing to eat every dinner since I got back at a restaurant or a hostel. I then went over to the Chinese restaurant and ordered a dinner there. While I was packing away my food, Shirley came in and said she and John would join me if I would like. ""Most certainly, I'd love to have some company."" So John and Shirley joined me and wanted to hear all about the trail. John was a quiet one but Shirley was really outgoing and interested. She had helped out a number of hikers over the years including a German couple that ended up staying at their house for a week! They were real Trail Angels! 
After dinner I grabbed my pack and they drove me back out to the trail. The first shelter, Ensign Cowall Shelter, was just a short walk and it was only 6:30. However Raven Rocks shelter where I had intended to go to was 5 miles away and it would be dark before I got there, so I decided to stop at the Ensign Cowall Shelter. There were only a few people at the shelter and it was supposed to rain tonight so I decided to stay in the shelter. Dragon Head and Polar Bear were already set up in the shelter, and Bearclaw was going to hammock nearby. Bearclaw had a big fire going in the fire pit and was cooking for dinner. Bearclaw was a talker and was regaling Polar Bear with stories of his medieval reenactment exploits. I'm not sure if he was listening but when Polar Bear walked off to hang his food bag, and Bearclaw kept talking, never missing a beat.
A little bit later, The Dude came into camp and was all enthused about meeting up with Bearclaw. ""Your reputation proceeds you!"" The Dude was planning on going on to Raven Rocks shelter and Bearclaw, sensing a receptive audience, said he'd join him on the night hike. Bearclaw hefted his pack on and away they went, up the trail, and the shelter got considerably quieter! 
It had been another good day of hiking in Maryland. The trail had been relatively level, I had had some good views and got to make a quick run into town and meet some new friends. Tomorrow would be July 4th, Independence Day, and I would cross the line, the Mason-Dixon Line, into Pennsylvania, and heading north.","Dahlgren Backpack Camp

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542040,"Hike Your Own Hike is a common mantra out on the AT. It's a recognition amongst hikers that everyone has their own speed, capability, and motivations. Today was my day to hike my own hike. I jumped forward 400 miles from where I got off the trail in Pine Grove Furnace, PA to Salisbury, CT. Always before I had been able to rejoin the trail where I had previously gotten off, always going north, and always carrying all my stuff. There are levels of purity for thru hikers, for some they only need to walk each mile, for some they need to stay on the trail continuously always going in the same direction with their full pack. For others walking each mile is not so important, it's more about experiencing the the trail and missing a few miles here or there is not so important . It's part of the hike your own hike mantra. When I got off for 10 zeroes in June to help my family drive cross country, I had made the decision that taking time off from the trail for family events was more important than the purity of my hike. I also decided that by doing that, flip flopping to do a thru hike was not going to be an option this year. I would jump ahead some number of miles when I got off in July for my grandson's baptism and come back in the fall to finish them, instead of going back to Marion, VA and completing a thru hike as I had originally hoped for.
I was now on a bus going from Cape Cod, MA to North Canaan, CT where I could get back on the trail in Northern Connecticut. My new plan was to get back on, hike Massachusetts, get off for another week to attend Oshkosh (EAA Airventure - world's largest fly-in and aviation event) and then return to where I got off and continue on to Mt. Katahdin, Maine. By skipping ahead it would ensure that I could make Maine in September, and then I could return to finish up PA, NJ, NY, and CT in October (fall colors!). I would dearly loved to have said I did a continuous thru hike, but these family and aviation events were more important to me in the long term. Hike your own hike.
The bus ride was a nine hour trip which included a 3 hour layover in Pittsfield, MA. It killed most of the day but I was actually rather impressed that I could find bus service that would put me within 9 miles of the AT. When I arrived in North Canaan I called a shuttle driver listed in Awol's trail guide and was able to get a shuttle to the trail for $20. It was late by the time I got to the trail, after 7 pm, and would be getting dark soon. I started down the trail and it felt good to be back walking. I would walk as far as I could until I found a reasonable camp site. If nothing else, there was a shelter 3.5 miles away. It was pleasant walking with just some minor uphill sections, just enough to make me breathe once again. I came to the 1500 mile marker shortly after getting back on the trail; only 689.2 to Mt. Katahdin! (And I was a little sad that because I skipped ahead I would no longer come to a mile marker and be able to say I had done all those miles) After a mile and a half I came to a small stream and a nice stealth campsite. It was 8 pm and the sun had set behind the hills, it didn't take much for me to decide that this was the perfect stop for the night. Minimal miles for the day, but I was back on the trail, heading north!","Cape Cod, MA

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542187,"I take back all the times I said Massachusetts and Connecticut would be easy. Connecticut went out with several steep rocky climbs up Lions Head and Bear Mtn, and then Massachusetts equaled that with climbs up Mt. Race and Mt. Everett. On a day hike these peaks would be fun but with a 35 pound pack I found them to be brutal. 
The weather today was warm and overcast. Climbing up Lions Head all the views were obscured with clouds. The next climb was up Bear Mountain and at 2354 ft it was the highest peak in Connecticut and we were up in the clouds. Some day hikers told me there were some gorgeous views up there. Nice to know. Descending down Bear Mountain was a bear. The descent consisted of climbing down large slabs of wet and slippery granite. It was slow progress. At the bottom was an area called Sages Ravine which had a nice stream with several waterfalls and pools. On a hot sunny day they would have made for nice swimming holes, but on a cloudy humid day like today they didn't look so inviting. Somewhere coming down Bear Mtn. I crossed the Massachusetts- Connecticut border but it wasn't marked. However crossing the stream at Sages Ravine they had a sign that said Welcome to Massachusetts. My birth state! Massachusetts didn't give you much a chance to celebrate with climbs up Mt. Race and Mt. Everett. The climbs weren't that big, only 600-700 feet, but straight up and very steep and rocky. As you get close to the summit of these peaks the trees were getting stunted and it looked like you were getting close to treeline even though they were below 3000 feet. New England winters can be brutal. 
I was not making good time today and got into a dry section and ran out of water going up Mount Everett. About that time it started thundering and pouring and so I stopped midway up and let the storm pass through. I got soaked waiting out the storm, but it was a case where if you put on a rain jacket you got soaked with sweat or you can just ""embrace nature"" and get soaked with cool rain water. The storm did help cool things down a little and after it let up a bit I continued my climb up the wet and slippery rocks of Mt. Everett. By the time I got to the top the sun was peaking out and it was clearing a bit. There used to be a fire tower on Mt. Everett which would have been nice to have today so you could get a view over the trees. The descent down Everett was fairly easy with few rocky sections. At the bottom there was a picnic area and a trail angel left large jugs of water on a picnic table for the thru hikers. I tanked up with water and continued on to the first shelter. I hadn't seen any hikers all afternoon and when I got to the shelter the only person there was a ridge runner. Her name was Smoke Signal and she had thru hiked the AT in 2015. It was nice to have someone there and we talked as I made my dinner. She was the ridge runner for all of Connecticut and the first part of Massachusetts. She checked on shelters and trail conditions as well as assisting hikers if they needed help. It was getting dark by 9 pm and I was exhausted from the rocks, so I climbed into my sleeping bag. Only 12 miles today but they were hard miles. Welcome to Massachusetts.","Stealth Camp north of Salisbury, CT

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546433,"For the second day in a row I let myself run out of water, and there was just no reason for it. Many of the streams listed on the map have gone dry, but I had ample opportunity to tank up where there was water.
I started my day at Hemlock shelter. I woke up at first light being attacked by mosquitos and started slapping at them. My slapping woke up poor Smoke Signal, and she was pissed. She got up soon after I woke her and packed her stuff and left the shelter. Sorry about that, but that's the hazards of sleeping in a shelter, no mosquito protection and no hiker noise protection. I got up a bit later as the sun began streaming through the trees. It looked to be a beautiful morning after yesterday's rain. My clothes that I had hung up were still wet, so I just had to put them back on. I did put on dry socks and would hang the wet ones on the back of my pack to dry. Today's miles would take me out of the mountains and down in a valley and I would pass between the towns of Great Barrington and Sheffield Massachusetts. 
The morning's walk was beautiful with a walk along a ridge with a series of ledges with nice views of the valley below. As the trail descended from the ridge we went over Mt. Bushnell and Jug End, and then a very steep descent to the valley below. The Housatonic River runs through the valley, which is about 6 miles wide with picturesque farms and forest areas. There is a memorial to the last battle of Shay's Rebellion, a fascinating historical uprising in 1786 and 1787, which helped to influence the U.S. Constitution. When I reached US 7 the lure of town food was once again strong and I hitched into town with another hiker named Glassy. He was going to get a room in town and as I talked to him it was apparent he was not enjoying the trail. The 1500 miles had been taking its toll on him, and I wondered if he would be able to take it when it got really tough again in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. There are always tough days, but to really persevere on the trail, you have to be joyful about the experience.
The driver giving us a ride stopped at the south end of town at a grocery store and we walked the rest of the way into town. I came upon a pizza place that looked like a descent lunch stop and Glassy continued on looking for a hotel. Great Barrington is a real tourist town in the Berkshires and has a lot of food options, but I was looking for a quick lunch and anxious to get back out on the trail.
After lunch I started walking back to the trail. I wasn't having much luck hitchhiking until I got back to the south end of town when a pickup truck stopped for me. People driving pickups are usually the best to get rides from, they don't mind a smelly hiker quite as much as the rest of civilized folk.
It was a breathlessly hot and sunny day back on the trail. The trail was passed through a number of farm fields and paralleled the Housatonic River. When I came to a spot where I could get into the river I took the opportunity for a cool dip. I stripped down to my shorts and waded out into the river. It was only about two feet deep, but I laid down in it and let the cool water flow over me. It felt wonderfully refreshing. I stayed in the river for quite a while, enjoying a sunny day and the cool river. 
Eventually it was time to get out and I stood around in the sun to air dry as I don't carry any kind of towel. Several hikers came by as I was drying off and one of them was Chuckles, who I had walked with for a morning back in Virginia. He had been cruising to make it up this far this fast. He told me he hadn't taken a zero day in over two months. That's being a beast!
I geared up and walked with Chuckles as the trail wound it's way through more farm fields. I needed to get water and it seemed like every stream or spring was dry. I kicked myself for not getting water in town when I had the chance. We came to the base of June Mountain and started up. It was only a 500 foot climb but very steep. There was a nice big rock outcropping at the top with great views of the Housatonic and the valley. After winding through more forest with some minor ups and downs there was another steep climb up East Mountain. Another great view from the top looking down on the valley 1000 foot below. Unfortunately we were looking right into the late afternoon sun so my pictures would not do the scene justice. I had another 2.5 miles to go to the shelter and still hadn't found any water. It's only 2.5 miles but it's amazing how desperate you start feeling when you are out of water. I was really kicking myself now. I finally got the shelter just as it was getting dark. I was really thirsty and a hiker named El Tejano offered me some water. The water for the shelter was 0.3 miles down a ravine, but the hikers at the shelter had found a small pool in a dry stream bed near the shelter. I was able to dip out a couple of liters out of that pool, but swore to myself I would never be so careless again.
At the shelter that night was Chuckles, Moldy Beans (a southbounder) and El Tejano (from Texas). They had a good campfire going and we swapped trail and life stories as we ate dinner. AT life, its always interesting when you look back over the day. Today took me down one mountain, across a valley, into a tourist town for pizza, wading in a river, up another mountain, a panic for water, and now I was sitting by the light of a campfire catching up with a hiker I had met 700 miles ago and a couple of hikers I would never see again.
