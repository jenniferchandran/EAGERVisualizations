Nurse Betty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/377598,"A year and a half ago on my birthday I woke up in my car. I was parked just off I-10 in lonely West Texas with only a defunct looking shipping yard close by. Looking out through a windshield studded with raindrops, I saw a spectacular double rainbow with beautiful shafts of sunlight breaking through the clouds highlighting the moist scrub desert and surrounding low mountains. Then I remembered; I had pulled over around four a.m. to get some rest and hadn’t seen any of this before I closed my eyes. It was so beautiful it seemed as if god had given me a birthday present. I am a traveling cath lab nurse with SpringBoard Healthcare, so I often find myself in unusual circumstances. At that time I was driving between assignments, from California to New Hampshire but going via Texas to visit mom and dad. I took a few minutes to soak in that morning desert view and within a few hours arrived in time for the birthday celebration my parents had prepared for me. Most of it involved eating cake and being harassed by the dogs my parents hold so dear in their hearts.It had become a priority for me to visit my parents often because my father has a rare type of leukemia, in his case a blood cancer and as a travel nurse my work gives me the ability to visit home between assignments. Dad was initially diagnosed more than a dozen years ago and underwent an initial round of chemotherapy that was largely successful. He was told the disease would likely return in the future and he would need periodic blood and bone marrow tests to check. He made all of his follow up appointments and was never told he needed the treatment repeated.During this time I watched as my father’s health declined significantly over a period of years. He lost weight despite a large appetite and he became easily fatigued. He looked much older each time I saw him, despite being a young retiree. My parents had moved to another locale in a different part of Texas just weeks before that October visit. This required, among other things, that they both get on board with new doctors. My father found a specialist for his type of disease and after many bureaucratic hurdles, was finally given “permission” to see this doctor under his insurance.  After the initial appointment and testing, during the follow-up, she bluntly informed him that his blood numbers were terrible, and that most of his bone marrow was not producing healthy red blood cells, only cancerous cells. He needed treatment quickly. My father has never spoken to me about it, but I get the sense that having been through chemotherapy once did not make him look forward to it the second time.The best news has been that the therapy worked. Faster and better than I think any of us could have hoped. Dad put weight back on, returned to his old ways of walking many miles per day, and also reverted to his vital, ruddy, youthful, and healthful appearance. And it made me think. My father grew up in Dutch Pennsylvania on a small farm. Both of his parents worked hard, his dad with a full time job during the day and of course both of them working the acreage, a large vegetable garden and some livestock. Undoubtedly much of that work fell to my father and his siblings. In general I consider my parents generation to be the last of the hard peasant Americans. Theirs was a generation of tough people that could have walked uphill in 10 feet of snow if they had to. Both ways. Common to that generation, he speaks of his growing up poor in a proud way, smiling and saying they always ate well thanks to the fertile land they worked. Earlier this year we had considered just a small challenge and kicked around the idea of hiking a few hundred miles of the Appalachian Trail, from my current assignment to his hometown in Pennsylvania, but the concept built into the idea of attempting a once-in-a-lifetime event. We now plan on trekking the entire distance from Georgia to Maine, encompassing nearly twenty-two hundred miles and over half a million feet of elevation gain. I am thankful my work as a traveling nurse with SpringBoard has afforded me the means and opportunity to strike out on such an amazing adventure with my father.I don’t truly know all that is in my father’s mind as we are so close to beginning our journey. The enthusiasm I hear from him when we talk on the phone is electric. I imagine he has lain awake often running through his mental checklists and equipment set-up. But, what does a person think when they are about to embark on a lifelong dream when just a year earlier the likelihood of this ever happening was all but nil?And what are his thoughts when the outcome is uncertain? The Appalachian, likely the most well-marked trail in America, sees up to two thousand people a year attempting a pilgrimage of its length. Statistically, around one in five people who aim to hike the entire distance are successful. This won’t be a walk in the park, even though the trail will take us through many state parklands. But, I have no doubts, my Dad comes from a tough generation and I’m excited to see him succeed.","Connecticut

Nurse Betty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/377600,We arrived in Atlanta nearly 20 hours after leaving Connecticut. Shuttle to Amicalola State Park early tomorrow morning. Then the planning ends and the real deal begins. Scary!,"Goergia

Nurse Betty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/377958,"Today was a proper tough christening of the AT, in the truest sense of the word. It rained for 28 straight hours. Is in fact still raining. As newbies we both started with overweight packs which of course felt even heavier, much, much heavier, with the added water weight. Spirits were great until late in the day, but being constantly wet and cold is truly as tough as others have said. Plus we walked extra miles hoping to stay in a hostel and I think both of us were dreaming of Oreos and milk as the payoff! Not to be, though hopefully a hostel stay is in the cards for Monday. Regardless, both of us will make drastic cuts to pack weight at the next stop. Lesson learned. Thankfully despite the extreme soaking and new wounds to go with it, lots of rubbed raw skin, it wasn't the hardest day of my life which simply confirms to me that Mustang, my father, and I will succeed!Cheers!!PS - we had both committed to not staying in shelters and that is working out for at least a couple of reasons. We stopped for breakfast at one this morning and saw firsthand some pack destruction caused by mice on several hikers gear. On their first nights on the trail. And unfortunately the weather caused serious overcrowding. Many staying wouldn't even leave except a few hardy folk and others that threw in the towel. We skipped the 3rd shelter after seeing that in both of the first two.PSS - Even in just two days, food thoughts drove us extra mileage. I seriously want a giant back of Oreos and 2L of Pepsi right now!!","AT mile 17.3

Nurse Betty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/378115,"Unfortunately I forced Mustang to take a day and a half off so I could recover from brutally abraded skin caused by a poor equipment choice. So a great hostel in Suches GA called Wolf Pen Gap Store is we are spending two nights. Great people and very helpful. And it's only $15 a night. Really the best thing is we are reducing our combined pack weight by close to 30 lb! Lesson learned and we'll be eager to move on. As thru hikers we need to start having some pretty high mileage (20+) days but the heaviest elevation changes lie just ahead. I'm proud of Mustang for persevering against mother nature and really quite a challenging start. I know he's eager to move on and so we shall. Update in a few days after we put away some miles. Oreos were in fact the first thing we ate upon arriving here! With milk and followed shortly by pizza and pepsi. Even though we only did 4 miles of trail before coming off into the hostel, it was a truly beautiful morning. Mist so dense that you could only see about 50 yards, unseen birds calling. Massive waterfall right on the trail that is normally probably only s trickle. What a true pleasure this trail is.","

Nurse Betty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/378442,"Our hostel stay came to an end at 5:30 am yesterday morning. It was followed by a 3 mile uphill walk to get back on the trail and 18.5 miles on the trail. Long day, tiring, but with beautiful views along the way. We met the Georgia ridgerunner Razor, part of the Georgia AT group, who helped to temper our expectations a little. Later we ran into Old Reb, another Georgia AT fellow, who was husbanding a group of teenagers. Good for him. Both Razor and Old Reb have previously thru hiked the AT. Nice to meet and both enthusiastic for us.The hostel stay was made especially nice by the addition of Sarge and Rick. Both ex-military, though Sarge had just finished 37.5 years in. It was fun to watch and be a part of the camaraderie they shared with Mustang. Tons of laughter. A side note - military guys keep things clean and organized, they make great housemates!12 miles into today we are both a little bruised and battered. Blisters for all and a few extra hurts besides. Fortuitously stopped right past the 50 mile marker just as more rain came in. Hammock and tarp up, I'm content to nap through it.DPS - what currently comes to mind is the phrase ""biting off more than you can chew.""","Suches, GA

Nurse Betty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/378537,"Once again Mustang and I came off the trail after short miles to tend wounds. Great hiker friendly town here - one fella, Jim, offered us any help he could give us just meeting us in the pharmacy.We have been overwhelmingly cheered by the folks we meet both on and off the trail. It's a simple reminder that despite the ease of social networking, including this journal, nothing beats looking someone in the eye and enjoying good face to face communication. Though physically challenging the trail is amazing. Mustang believes we've entered a place where Newton's idea of physics is reversed, as in ""what goes down must go up,"" and quick! Any slight downhill is seemingly immediately followed by an elevation gain.We shared a fire made from wet wood last night between us and it was quite nice. Mustang set fire to some of his socks in what I believe was a subconscious attempt to root out the blister causing evils. I'm happy. I take great joy in the views and wildlife and especially the company of my father. We've come across rabbit and toad and a copperhead snake. Heard tales of baby black bear. Many varieties of flowering and perfumed plants and shrubs. Endless birdsong.Nurse BettyPS - to those that will understand this, not a hairy leg in sight. Either shaved or wearing pants!","Hiawassee

Nurse Betty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529170,"nurse Betty is just over a week from seeing the trail again. This is a bit of a surprise as two weeks in arrears there was no thought of this side adventure. Spring has spung where I currently live, already the brown grasses of summer have tapped in. The green tunnel beckons in a surprising way. The pain that is it's own reward. The sudden surprise of completely unexpected and unguessed at natural phenomenon (you nature enthusiasts and vigilant life observers are shaking your head in complete understanding, while the balance of you are unimpressed). The ""what seriously!! more uphill?!"" The adorably crazy loons who randomly appear in your path, sometimes repeatedly. Looking the part of the loon after a hard, sweaty, unfulfilling day. The lovely knowledge that what you are doing is truly only important to you.I can't wait to miss a Pepsi so bad I think about it for an hour (or two) straight while walking.I'm not sure why this is suddenly happening again!! It's good. Or scary. Nurse Betty out! Next message from that place where daily discovery is the penultimate prize!","Georgia
