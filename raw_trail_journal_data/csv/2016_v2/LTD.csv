LTD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479874,"I heard an older man on the TV the other day say that the first 50 years of your life is for learning and the second 50 is for living. I have learned a lot in the first 50 years. A lot of what I have learned is what not to do. I don't intend to make the same mistakes again. I started the process of a through hike about the time I turned 50. I am now 52. In the last two years I have met the woman of my dreams, quit the family business that I couldn't take anymore,sold my house,bought a new one and started traing for a 2185 journey of a lifetime. On February 9th that journey begins. An Appalachian Trail thru hike.      I dont't know if I will live to be 100 yrs. old or not,but I do know that what ever time I have left I will live it like it is my last. There will be no more I might,I wish, I should have,could have or would have. Instead they will be replaced by I will,I can,I am and I have. There comes a point when you get busy living or get busy dying. I choose living. With the help of my beloved Carole I intend to fulfill this dream.       Well, enough psych bable. I have laid out my gear and deciding what to take. It is in the single digits here in PA. I am going to test out my 10 deg. bag and sleepig pad out.

Received my first trail magic when I got back to the parking light coming back down from Springer Mountain. Someone left an orange for me. Thank you. I ended up giving it to Justin who I met at the shelter.Rainy start but cleared up in the afternoon. First experience in shelter wasn't bad. Only one other person and his dog were there.
I listen to my iPod when I walk. when I hear certain songs they make the walk faster. One in particular is the Nickelback song what are you waiting for. This song a special meaning to me for certain reasons. But for the purpose of this hike one verse really stands out.
You gotta go and reach for the top
Believe in every dream that you got
You're only living once so tell me
What are you, what are you waiting for?
You know you gotta give it your all
And don't you be afraid if you fall

I was warm enough but couldn't sleep because of all the noise. Got picked up by the Hiker Hostile. Going to stay there tonight and head for Neels gap in the morning.Finally got a view from Ramrock mountain. I love listening to my iPod when I walk. The Bob Seger song came on Roll Me Away. It reminded me of forest Gump when he was running through the mountains. Some people have already called me Forest Frank. I've decided to send a lot of stuff that I really don't need to carry right now. Like I stove some extra clothing and a few odds and ends.

The hostel was going to shuttle someone to Neels gap anyhow so I just had them drop most of my stuff off at Mountain crossings. Hiking today felt like walking on air. I caught myself almost running several times. My legs were thanking me all day. My brain is going to get me through this hike. I think my body is finally realizing that it is just along for the ride. I think it's starting to realize that this is what we are going to do every day for the next six months so It better get used to it.Beautiful day to hike. Not a cloud in the sky got up to around 60° today. First day I could hike in shorts today.Today was the first day I passed a lot of people on the trail. On top of blood mountain several people hiked up to have a birthday party for one of their friends. Couldn't have picked a better day to go over blood mountain. Headed for Neil's gap.

I don't know if someone left it there or just dropped it but I think I was meant to find it. I will be carrying it for the rest of the hike as a good luck charm. If I meet someone on the trail that I think needs it more than I do,then I shall give it to them. Then I will find a new good luck charm. Maybe a dime and do the same thing. Then maybe a quarter. Sort of a good luck charm snowball. 
The 6.9 miles to Hogpen Gap was tough. So I called Bob at Top of Georgia Hostell and he picked me up. Very nice guy. I highly recommend the Hostel. Very nice.

Can't get through the smokies anyhow from what I've been hearing. Took the blue blaze trail to get ride into Franklin from trail angel Beverly. Might be here a while. She is in the guide book. The trail is steep and rocky for first mile then turns into a road for the 2nd mile. Going to be a rough climb back up to Bly Gap after this storm. I don't think the guide book says anything,but a lot of the roads are gated until March 1. A lot of the gaps have a long hike to get in and out. Deep Gap is about 5 miles.

LTD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481738,"I would like to pass on a story I heard from Bob at top of Georgia hostile a few days ago. I was laying on the couch watching TV while he was talking to someone on the phone. When he was done he explained to me what the conversation was about. He was on the phone with a mentally retarded man who was hiking last year and someone stole some of his gear. Bob was trying to get him some new gear so he could go hiking this year. What kind of an individual steals a mentally retarded man's hiking gear when he's in the middle of the woods? I have only been out here a little over a week, but I have met the best of humanity,some I would just rather forget, and met a few people named Brian Williams. If you know what I mean.I feel sad for the person who had to steal that man's hiking gear. I hope he finds a better trail to go down in the future. Some of the best in humanity I found was at top of Georgia hostile. Bob and his staff were fantastic. It is a great place to stay, very clean, very friendly and helpful. Also it is now pet friendly. They have a whole section for people with their dogs. Thanks again to Bob and the staff.","Franklin,N.C.

After we rested then we had another thousand foot climb in 1.4 miles to couthouse bald.My pack was really tired after that. Nice day of hiking after it warmed up. Got to standing Indian shoulder around four. Wanted to go to beach gap tenting area but didn't think I could make it before dark and my legs were beat after the long climbs. Thought I was going to be alone in the shelter but Ox showed up. He started the same day I did but he did the approach Trail. It was nice to have a friendly face. The mice kept us awake a lot of the night. It got down to around 20° but I stayed nice and warm in like 10° bag.I have to stay warm so nothing freezes and falls off.

Ox was still breathing so I left him sleep. He walks a lot faster than I do so I knew he would catch up. Long climb up standing Indian mountain but it's worth the view on the side trail. When I finally got to Albert Mt. the wind was blowing so hard I could hardly stand up so I had to decide wether to risk doing the rock climb to the top or take the bypass. There was still a lot of ice everywhere after the freezing rain two days before. Because of the wind and the ice and that I'm hiking alone and it was really foggy, there would have been no view,I decided it wasn't worth the risk so I took the bypass. Arrived at Longbranch shelter around five and Ox showed up about 30 minutes later. Was tired after the 16.2 miles so I got in my sleeping bag right away to rest. Hope I can get some sleep tonight.

When I got to winding stair gap there was 4 inches of snow still on the ground. The only photo op was at Siler bold today.

That is why the short day. I got picked up at Wayah gap by Wiggy. He runs the Nantahala Mountain Lodge. This is a very nice Hostel. Has to be one of the nicest on the trail.

I hiked this section south because Wiggy wasn't sure if he could get into Tellico Gap to pick me up. When we got to the gap the snow plow was sitting at the top of the hill. Perfect timing. One thing about hiking a section southbound is that you pass a lot of NB hikers. Stopped to talk to a lot of nice people today. After taking a day off I took a nice bite out of the elephant today,13.5. Going to be in NOC tomorrow. Goat,his son and Smokes all showed up at the Hostel last night.

LTD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523491,Not sure where I got off on my mileage so I just adjusted it here. There is a sign at Rector Laurel Road for another hostel a half mile up the road. The phone number is on the sign.After taking a day off and adjusting my pack I felt good today other than some toe issues. First time I used my Big Agnes copper spur UL 2. Worked great. I love it. Plenty of room and easy set up. Only one at the campsite tonight. Watched The Big Short and Bridge of Spies before going to bed.,"Devil Fork Gap

LTD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523495,"Did the 11.1 miles into Erwin in four hours and 15 minutes. Other then a short climb out of Spivey Gap, rest of the hike was one of the easiest so far. They were calling for rain so I tried to get done before I got wet. Just rained a little bit. Got back with time to spare. I had some sore toes so I put some toe sponges over the sore ones. Helped quite a bit. Going to get a ride to Johnson City tomorrow and try to get a new pair of shoes.","Spivey Gap

LTD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523580,Went to the outfitters yesterday in Johnson City and got the only size 13 wide shoes they had. They are Keen Targhee II hiking boots. Wouldn't have been my first choice but it's the only ones they had in my size. But they did fix my toe problems that I was having. Ordered a pair of super feet insoles from Amazon and should have them tomorrow. I decided to just do a short Day today to break in the shoes and try them out. They were calling for rain for a week today but it turned out to be a beautiful day.,"Erwin,Tn

Getting stronger every day. The new shoes feel great and have solved all the problems I was having with my toes. Had some real nice trail magic when I come out at iron Mountain gap today. Everyone has been great so far. Should have 100 miles in by the end of the week. Hiker legs should be coming around. Will start doing more miles by the end of the week.","Indian Grave Gap

Think I'll try stopping where I don't have such a big climb every morning. Get my legs warmed up before a long climb. Several sections in the last 5 miles were extremely rocky. Hard on the ankles knees and hips. Got lucky again today and missed the rain they were calling for. Going to stay at Mountain Harbor Hospital tonight,"Overmountain Shelter
