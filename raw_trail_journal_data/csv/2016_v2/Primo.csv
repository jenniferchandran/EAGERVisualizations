Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/496950,"After years of imagining, longing, and dreaming; the time has come. I think the realization that the time to make the trek will never present itself in an obvious way and there will be no mystical message informing me that the time is now right; I have made the decision to make the time and start the journey.The thought of a six-month reprieve from the life that is mine feels horribly selfish as I have so many people seemingly dependent upon my presence. Yet these same people who I love and am loved by will be the first to support and encourage the adventure. After so many years of building companies, devotion to family and friends, helping our community and those in need; I have a burning desire to take a step back, reflect, regain perspective and establish a plan for the last phase of life. This is the goal of my trip - simplify my thoughts, directions, plans and goals while quieting the noise of life. The planning has begun and I firmly believe my world will adjust to accommodate.   ",,It's a Go!,"May 26, Tue",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497338,"I read Zach Davis' book ""Appalachian Trials"", completed the assignments, and was up all night with excitement. Converting a long-term objective into a short-term goal is both exhilarating and panic-making. Though I have a year to get ready, there seems to be so much worry about. Chief among them, will my wife MaryAnne be stable enough for me to go. We've been battling stage 4 metastatic breast cancer for over two-years and, though it can never be cured, the newest treatment seems to be keeping her stable. For now . . . and that's the worry. Having been unable to really plan anything over these past two-years, I'm taking a huge chance even thinking about this trip, let alone planning for it. Still, it is something I can't get out of my system and something I really need to do. I've been ""hiking"" almost every day - as much as one can in suburban Long Island - and am planning a 17 mile hike tomorrow morning. Though I've always been a runner, I want to get use to the pace of walking and not rushing. Of noticing my surroundings and appreciating them rather than running through them. I want to learn to enjoy the trip, not just the finish. So the training for me is physical but mostly about getting my mind right. Learning the slow and steady.",,Zach's Book,"May 28, Thu",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497493,"I'm still apprehensive about announcing my intention to the world. I'm not sure what the reaction will be, especially since MaryAnne's condition is and will be questionable. One of the biggest motivators for doing the thru hike is because of what she has been through with treatment and surgeries. My motto is: ""If she can do that, I can do this"". There are also three local organizations that have helped us tremendously over these past two-years - Adopt A House, United Friends of America, and The Babylon Breast Cancer Coalition. I would like to do the hike as a fundraiser for these three groups with the proceeds divided equally among them. So the timing should be carefully planned and not to far in advance so that my friends, family, and clients don't grow weary and burn out during the prep stage. Looking forward to the weekend and a long hike in the morning.",,Getting the word out,"May 29, Fri",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/498224,"Went for my first true test hike on Saturday, a 15 mile jaunt down the Bethpage State Park path and learned the following:1. Sneakers/running shoes are not for hiking - I need the support that only a hiking boot can offer for the roots, uneven terrain, rocks, and water. 2. I had completely forgotten that running shorts with a liner will chafe. Ouch. Next time bring the Glide.3. I use much less water walking than I do when running. Way over packed the camelback.4. Time takes time so take my time. I still have a tendency to want to ""get 'er done"" rather than maintaining a casual mindset. Even though I did take a number of side trails (some dead-enders), it was over too soon. My pace was 17 minute miles with only two short stops. I need to slow it down.These are all re-learns for me as I knew this ""stuff"" from the 60 mile three day we did in Dallas.",,Lessons already,"Jun 02, Tue",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/498510,"A quick 5.25 mile walk today in the new hiking boots from our REI buying spree. It's sooooo exciting researching, building a gear list, and then making the purchases. Expensive but exciting. My goal is a 20 lb pack without food or water and to come in at or below $3,000. With the major items purchased - tent, bag, pack, boots, poles, sleeping pad, etc.; I'm on budget and only slightly over weight. My beloved wife MaryAnne has been incredibly helpful and supportive and my youngest daughter Hilarie tracks me while I'm out walking/hiking on some app she has on her phone. I am so grateful for their encouragement and for making this a family project.",,View Entry,"Jun 03, Wed",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/500063,"The gear list is assembling nicely and I'm happy to report being under-weight and under budget thus far. Tested the tent out last weekend and, though snug, everything was as advertised. Tomorrow is planned for a 22 mile hike to the beach via Jones Beach Causeway. Will be carrying a full pack and will look like ""that guy"" you see on the road and wonder where he came from and where he is going.",,Big Test Tomorrow,"Jun 12, Fri",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/500488,"Learned a big lesson yesterday regarding the effects of the weight to the pack on a long hike. Set out from home on foot for a walk to cedar beach, just over 20 miles, thinking I could amble along at my normal pace and feel my normal self at the end of the hike. I intentionally packed the pack for extra weight - 25 lbs - to truly get a feel for it. I haven't carried a heavy pack since the Army and didn't remember it being too challenging then so I didn't expect there would be a struggle. By mile 5, I was thinking about dumping the water to lighten the load. By mile 10, I was thinking about calling MaryAnne to come and get me. By mile 15, I was hoping my legs would continue to hold up, and at the end I was thinking about how foolish my assumptions had been. Yes, I made it, but the victory is in the lessons learned. First, breaks are good. I was too concerned about the time and pace to stop often enough for a breather. I waited until I was aching instead of being proactive. Second, I'm not 18 and as omnipotent as I once was. Lastly, if I push myself too hard, too fast, I'll get hurt. I should of done a much shorter test hike and built up to this. These lessons are for me an essential part of preparation so I don't have to learn them in real-time. The scary part is I have so much more to learn. The exciting part is learning it.",,First hike with new pack,"Jun 14, Sun",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501860,"The word of the trip has been divulged to family and the comments range from ""why would you do that"" to ""how can you do that"". I have yet to break the news to friends, clients, and those our vast network of non-profits - some of which we'll be raising money for. The decision to do the hike as a fund raiser gives it added purpose for me and will keep me committed. I've been following the journal of a current thru-hiker known as 3D and am so grateful that he is sharing his trip. I'm learning a lot by experiencing his trip vicariously. Currently preparing for a 3-day test hike along the AT in New York. I plan it for the weekend after July 4th and am really excited to see how I do in real conditions.",,View Entry,"Jun 22, Mon",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503281,"I'm itching to get out and do the section hike planned for next week. Actually, I'm itching to say ""goodbye"" to traffic, hustle, appointments, and professional responsibilities for just a little while. A week in the woods will be the perfect remedy - thank you for the suggestion to take 6 days rather than 3 for NY. I'm geared up and ready to go.",,Geared up,"Jul 01, Wed",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504187,"Dad always said you can't fit 20 pounds of ""stuff"" into a 10 pound bag. Yes, yes you can. Here's proof. All packed and ready to go though I think I packed way too much food. It all fit so I'm taking it and we'll see. That's what this 4-day trip is about - finding out what works and what doesn't. The pack weight is on target at 30 pounds so . . . who knows. First time into the woods alone since the Army. This should be, at the very least, interesting.",,Ready Spaghetti,"Jul 07, Tue",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504484,"The plan to start the 4-day test was postponed a day due to weather. Not that I shouldn't get prepared for bad weather, I just don't want to start in it the first time out. So . . . tomorrow morning the trip begins. Leaving here at 6:00 A.M. and now staying out until Monday rather than Sunday. Let the games begin!",,Start delayed,"Jul 09, Thu",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505129,"Waiting for pick-up and heading home after the training run. Learned so much and experienced so much in such a short span of time. Got a little bit lost twice, learned that being in shape is nowhere near being in THIS kind of shape, met some amazing people, had fun sprinkled with spots of misery, and can't wait to do it again!",,"3.5 wonderful,painful,exhilirating,humbling days","Jul 13, Mon",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505280,"Back to work today - yuck. Reflecting on the test hike - Yeah. What a glorious experience it was, capped off by the following lessons learned:1. All of the normal ""training"" I did proved inadequate for the challenged encountered. For some reason, the type of conditioning required for a hike like this requires hiking like this. It took until the 3rd day for me to find my stride and progress at a reasonable pace.2. The folks met on the trail are incredible. The bond with fellow hikers is immediate and comes without any prejudgment, conditional acceptance, or guarded conversation. The advice and recommendations regarding gear, food, technique, etc. are absolutely priceless. An amazing band of sisters and brothers.3. The challenge is both physical and emotional. A moment of clarity occurred in the middle of day 2, in the middle of being lost, when I shifted from being frustrated and hurried to laughing at myself and chilling out. In that moment, everything changed for the better and stayed that way for the remainder of the hike. I learned to not take myself or the ""mission"" so darn seriously.So much more learned during every mile. The equipment worked flawlessly and fear of carrying too much food turned into a reality. The plan now is to shave another 5 pounds from the pack weight.",,Test Lessons,"Jul 14, Tue",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505558,"When I was first learning to fly, I was told to be careful - once bitten by the bug it gets into your blood and you can never shake the need to soar. Thirty years later, I'm still looking up every time I hear a plane.Seems the same is true for this adventure. The little taste of it over a long weekend has left me thirsty for more. I'll be heading back with a lighter pack (rhyme)  the second week in August to complete NY and start CT. The plan currently is to complete NY, CT, NJ and, perhaps, a piece of PA this summer, fall and winter. That way, when doing the thru hike next year, I can shoot home for a week when I hit this portion of the trail, re-gear, hang with my darling, and not miss a beat. Thank you all for your love, words of encouragement, and support. It's nice to share my head and my heart with those in the know.",,Next Test,"Jul 15, Wed",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505559,"A big concern for next year is the number of people that will attempt the trail after the Bryson movie hits the screens this fall. It seems that March/April starts in Springer are already a bit crowded and the movie will definitely exacerbate the problem.
As a result, some folks are planning and increasingly popular thru hike called a ""flip-flop"". The most common form is to start in Harper's Ferry, VA; head north to Maine and complete the northern section. Once done, the hiker shuttles back to Harper's Ferry and heads south to complete the southern portion. Same miles, same stature, less grief it seems. I'm going to investigate a bit further.",,Katadin,"Jul 15, Wed",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508112,"Heading out again on Thursday for another 4-day test run. Picking up where I left off from the last test and hope to complete NY and get into CT. This time, I feel much, much more prepared. The pack weight is down to 25 lbs and I am acutely aware of my own limitations. The goal this time is complete enjoyment and some wet weather camping as rain showers are expected throughout the weekend. My friends are helping to set up the fundraising page and I'm feeling excited. Though February seems like it is so far away; when I start thinking about all that needs to be put into place, it feels like it will be here tomorrow. Thank you all for your love and support.",,Test Trek - Take Two,"Aug 01, Sat",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508809,"I was planning a 4-day hike with a departure date of tomorrow and, as the week became overwhelmingly busy, pushed it back until September. There is soooo much that needs to be done in the yard and with home projects that I need to spend the next two weekends completing as much as I can get done before our 2.5 week trip to Europe. I know, high-end problems and I sound like I'm whining. Still, the pressure I put on myself to get this stuff done is non-stop. Today it occurred to me that this is exactly how I've lived my life for as long as I can remember and this is exactly what I am trying to escape and change about myself by doing this trek. So . . . I'm gong to leave on Friday. I'd go tomorrow but at this late hour I don't have time to get ready. Instead of Thursday to Sunday I'll go Friday to Monday. Feeling guilty, unproductive, like I'm slacking . . . I'm going.",,Torn Between Two Worlds,"Aug 05, Wed",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/509541,"Back from the brush after a wonderful two-day hike through NY and CT. The terrain proved to be much easier than expected so I ended up doing 20 miles on day 1 and 17 miles on day 2. This put me at my pick-up point on the evening of the second day and my heroic wife drove to Kent, CT and scooped me up. I feel much more confident and better prepared after this test run than I did the first. Though it was not without its challenges (I forgot my trekking poles and used a stick, found out The Garden Center no longer allowed overnights and had to hike an additional five miles to the next spot, my expectations were more appropriate and my adaptability enhanced.The picture is of another section hiker named Huck Finn; a journalism student from France that I had the honor of naming. I picked Huck Finn because of his straw hat and plaid shirt. We hiked together off and on the second day. Standing next to him is our unofficial greeter to CT, complete with 3-corner hat, some history of the trail in CT, and (bless him) some frozen snickers and Gatorade! Connecticut is an incredibly beautiful part of the trail as it winds along the Housatonic river. Simply delightful.   The next test will come in October. I'll start at Bear Mountain in NY and work my way south into NJ. Test Trek Three will be a true challenge as this part of the trail is a difficult one.Thank you all for your love and support.",,Test Trek Two Completed,"Aug 10, Mon",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510121,"Already beginning prep for the next test. This will be 4 days from Bear Mountain, NY south to as far as we can get into NJ. I say ""we"" because my BFF Cindy is considering joining me. Not departing until October, however, the planning is such a fun part of the experience, why not start now? Why October? I've been out twice in the warm/hot weather and want to get some chilly nights under my belt. Test Trek 4 will actually be in late November or December when it should be darn cold. Hopefully, even a little snow. Here is another pic from test trek 2.",,Test Trek Three,"Aug 14, Fri",0
Primo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513424,Heading out again the first weekend in October to finish Southern NY and step into NJ. Hopefully it will continue to be a little chilly so I can test something other than shorts and t shirts Had a wonderful trip to Europe and put on some additional pounds that need burning off. The start of the thru hike feels so close! Most of the folks I have been following are finishing up over this next week and I look forward to hearing their stories.,,On the road again,"Sep 14, Mon",0
