Checked out of the Iron Horse Station (both the Inn and the restaraunt downstairs were great and I highly recommend them both) and started hiking at 7:45 am. Several forest sections of trail between Hot Springs and Hwy 70 (Allen Gap) had a recent fire as there were blackened trees all around and not as much under-growth. I was told by the shuttle driver that there was a fire back in April of this year and both sides of the highway had been burned badly. Lighting was to blame for the fire. As of a few weeks ago, there was a mandated ""no camp fire"" ban from GA, NC and TN due to the drought. You can still use your camp stoves for cooking but no open fires.   I saw several signs posted on the trail about the same. Beautiful clear blue skies all day with no hint of the smoke filled skies I saw yesterday traveling back to Hot Springs. Forest fires in the Cohutta forest and near the NOC had blanketed the area with thick smoke. With daylight savings and the fall months, it's getting dark earlier and not as many hiking hours. Stopped at 4:00pm today at Little Laurel Shelter, after a 19.6 mile day. No one here but that may change later this evening. I decided to set up my tent close to the shelter as I would prefer to sleep in tent.   My left ankle/foot is much better and my time off last week did the trick. I also attribute my recovery with using ice treatment often and a calf sleeve ""Zensah"" that I now swear by. I also used them today on the hike and believe they are helping.   There weather lol looks great tomorrow as well and a potential for rain on Wednesday am. That will be the first rain I will experience on the AT (if it happens) and I know that is much different than what most other hikers experience.   Goal is to get to Erwin by Thursday night/Friday morning and based on how I am feeling, that shouldn't be a problem.

On the ride back to Harper's Ferry, the rain was about 30 minutes late do I hustled up to the ATC office where they had held my pack for me while I was in DC. Thanks to the great staff at ATC for keeping my backpack and staying open late.  I checked into the The Towns Inn hostel and went next door and ate again at the Bistro 1840 where I met a couple from Holland here on vacation.  Another hiker from the hostel was in the same little vestibule eating dinner so most of the conversation centered around the AT and our personal stories about hike.  Not much sleep last night as the other two hikers found some common topics so they stayed up late talking and my sleep pattern had changed this past weekend so it was hard to drift off.   Started the morning with a homemade breakfast at the Towns Inn and was off on the trail shortly after 7.  Walked along the C&O Canal Towpath/Potomac River which was beautiful and was also passed by several freight and passenger trains.  
Once crossed over the Potomac I was hiking in Maryland, although I never saw the state cross over sign. Hiked past several Civil War sites today including Brownsville Pass and Gathland State Park.  It would be fascinating to walk along Maryland's Civil War Trails' Antietam Campaign but maybe I will comeback for that.   
I was surprised to find the very first Washington Monument is actually along the AT.  The nearby volunteers of Boonesboro celebrated their July 4th, 1827 by erecting a large stone monument in memory of George Washington, around 60 years earlier than the current monument in DC. Stopped at the Pogo Memorial Campsite which has a privy but no shelter which is a little unusual.

She stopped in at Tumbling Run shelters.  Cool set up with two shelters and a pavilion in between.  I pressed on to Chimney Rocks where I found a good tent site and called it a day.   The weather is forecasted to be very wet on Friday so tomorrow I need to get to Ironmasters Mansion Hostel and potentially take zero there on Friday.

Katahdin.  I believe the official mileage this year is 2189 miles so the true half point for me is another few miles up the trail.  Either way, I am happy to have made it this far in 54 days of hiking/camping along the AT.  I made it to the Ironmaster's Mansion in the late afternoon, only to find out that the whole place had been rented out to a school group for the night.  The innkeeper helped me find a motel in Mount Holly and was kind enough to drive me to the motel, Holly Inn.  I walked down to the laundry mat, washed my clothes and went back to the motel for dinner which was great and the beers were pretty god too!Longest day yet at 28.3 miles","Chimney Rocks

It was impossible to keep my shoes and socks dry so I just gave up early in the day.   It rained most of the day and my trusty umbrella came out and did great.   I still get some strange looks when I pass people but my guess is that they are jealous of my hands free tool and that I am pretty dry.   Finished the audiobook ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"".  Another classic but a hard book for me to listen to with all of the different dialects.  Part of the trail walks you through and around some private farmlands.  Along one of these areas I walked up on a large frog in the middle of the muddy trail and surprised it just stood there, so I took a picture and moved on.  Got close to the campsite so decided to hike into Boiling Springs to find some food and did at Cafe 101.   After devouring a soup and sandwich combo, I also polished off an apple fritter. It was so good, I got two to go for breakfast in the morning.  On my way back I stopped at the ATC Mid-Atlantic office and chatted with one of the volunteers.   Also met another FF hiker at the office  who was headed back to the Holly Inn.  He was having issues with his shoes and was coming back to the Boiling Springs outfittter to get some different shoes.  Ended up back at the ATC Backpacker camp which was about 19 miles for the day.  As I was setting up my tent, I found out just how close the railroad tracks were to the campsite.

Before night fall, 5 more tents showed up and made camp while the rain lightly fell. The first part of the day was reasonably flat but muddy from the recent rains.  The later part of the day became tough with the rocks and ascents.  Hiked through some beautiful yellow fields of flowers as the AT followed property boundaries of farmlands. Today I was listening to Grapes of Wrath audiobook which was ironic due to the rich farmland setting I was in most of the day.

Crossed over the Susquehanna River amongst all of the traffic going to work.  Then started the climb up the ridge line paralleling the river.  The ticks make the climb that much harder but once in top it flattened out and I made pretty good time. Met up with Chrissy & Checklist who were both flip-floppers from Harper's Ferry.  Passed Clark Creek, which reminded me a lot of our Creek at our cabin in N.GA.   I talked to a section hiker that told me he thinks the worst part of the AT in Pennsylvania is coming up right after PA 501 and 20 miles north of that. If that's true then I will be in that section on Wednesday on my way into Port Clinton.  Stopped at the Yellow Springs Campsite.  The last two spring crossings on the trail were definitely yellow in tint and color. 24.7 miles today.","Doyle Hotel

Stopped at a nice campsite with an overlook-type view for a nice sunset. No one at the campsite as of this posting so it's nice and quiet.  The relentless rocks on the trail are starting to get a bit rougher and my feet and ankles are quite sore tonight.  25.1 miles for the day.  My brother-n-law is coming to meet me Thursday morning at Port Clinton so he can experience 2 days of hiking and camping in the AT.  I will be returning home after my brother-n-law leaves the trail.  Will be fun to share this adventure with another family (male ) member.

Found some trail magic on the trail and picked up some fig bars.  Makes for an extra breakfast which I did enjoy. Hiked through several miles of a prescribed burn area which made for some not so good looking areas.  The rocks on the trail seemed to get a littler worse than yesterday but not as many easier stretches which made yesterday feel better. Left ankle and right foot are sore, so looking forward to slowing down over the next two days. Very steep descent into Port Clinton and walked across a railroad yard toward the town. Checked into Port Clinton Hotel, did some laundry, resupplied and made a bunch of calls to line up my plans with my brother-n-law coming in tomorrow.  Had dinner at the the hotel which was substantial, cheesesteak, fries and a few cold ones. Met a family that was out for the day, visiting several watering holes in the area to celebrate the mom's birthday.

Talk about trail magic!
Woke up early and walked down to the 3C Restaurant for breakfast before my brother-n-law arrived from Philly.  It was a little less than a mile hike down to the restaurant which sounds far but was no big deal.  You never think about walking to breakfast when your home, right?
My brother-n-law arrived from Philly right in time and we parked his car near the AT.  We packed up and headed out for our short journey together.   It's great to share this experience with your family and friends.  We had tough ascent out of Port Clinton but once we made it to the ridge line, all was better. We stopped at Pulpit Rock for lunch and then the Pinnacle.  It spit rain on us for few hours during the day but not too bad. We made good time for the day, being this was my brother-n-law's first AT hike plus the first real test after his full knee replacement.  Later in the day we met up with Snowhite (FF), Grapevine (FF) and Wallstreet NOBO.  Made camp and had a good time talking about family and getting updated on everything that was changing.  Cold evening and found out that my Zpacks Duplex tent really is a two man tent, no problem.  15.1 miles for the day.","Port Clinton Hotel

I know I have plenty more of this in my near future but seemed more difficult after being off the trail for almost a month and after gaining back a good bit of the weight I had lost.  I also broke both of my carbon fiber poles (just above the tip) while traversing the rock sections.  I have tried to fix them from splitting up the remaining pole so we will see how they work in the morning.  Today's section only had two good spots for water and as hot as it was today, reminded me of my hike through N.GA this past October.  Stopped Bake Oven Knob shelter to drink and pick up as much water as possible and then moved just north on the trail for a nice campsite.

From there it's a long steep descent down to Grafton Notch. Hiked with Lookout and Mercury who started the trail in early April. Another long steep climb up Baldpate West and East summits. I was running low on food so I decided to go into Andover and stay at the Pine Ellis Lodging.  Once I arrived, I started my laundry and took a shower. Next I walked to the local market and sat down at their deli for homemade meatloaf, mash potatoes, carrots and a side order of fries.  After I ate that I polished off a pint of banana pudding ice cream.  Can life much better?  Bought some resupply food and a cold beer and went back to the hostel where I crashed.  I did get a menu fir breakfast at the deli and intend to go back early tomorrow morning before the shuttle drops me back off at the trail head.","Full Goose shelter

Also met Thomas, SunDog and SheWolf sho were all SOBO's. Tough climb up Old Blue Mountain but beautiful views at the top. A lot of rebar and wooden ladders climbing up to this peak. Met Princess Anne at the top of Old Blue where I stopped and grabbed some lunch.  She was from California and had hiked all over the world.  We talked about the White mountains which were coming up for her in a few days. Next peak was Bemis Mountain and it seemed like I had entered the land of rocks and roots (plus going up and down like crazy).  Also around Bemis was a good deal of hiking on solid exposed rock (granite) with a crazy zig-zag route.  When you get to the top of most of these peaks, the pine trees are like dwarfs and there is little soil and several different colored misses are growing.  When I arrived at Bemis stream tent-site there were already 5-6 tents pitched.  I recognized two of the hikers and they told me that they had just finished eating trail magic at the road we just crossed.  Sounded like I missed quite a feast.  I think when I get off the trail I will make plans to drive into the N.GA mountains during the hiking season and sponsor some trail magic.","Pine Ellis Lodging

The weather over the past several days here in Maine has just been great with little to no rain but was definitely hot today with the High in the upper 80's. I enjoyed being under the ""green tunnel"" and out of the blazing sun. Hiked up on about a dozen kids out for a six day hiking and camping trip during a summer camp. They're all from Plymouth, Vermont.  Today's hike was pretty easy miles and ended by stopping at the Hiker Hut about 0.3 miles north of the AT.  This was no ordinary Hostel and very much more of a throw back to a very simple life.  I was offered a dip in the creek and then a warm shower next to the creek in a very unique ""on-demand"" hot shower.  After getting cleaned up, Steve and his wife offered me some lunch which was huge portion of potato salad, salad (direct from their garden) and a left over hamburger.  What a treat!  I shared with Steve that I needed to get down to Farmington to pick up a car either tonight or early tomorrow.  His wife said she was going that way anyway, so I decided to accept the ride from her and not stay the night.  After picking up my car, I drove to Gorham, to stay the night and also eat at my favorite restaurant, Nonna's where my brother-n-law ate several days ago when we were in town.  This was a great leg of my AT adventure but I need to go back home for a few days but will be back soon to finish up.","Benise stream

Sent my first and only food drop to Lakeshore House Hostel in Monson, ME so that I can be ready for the hike through the 100 mile wilderness.  I started my trip back up to Maine (8/7) sigh a quick stop at Mountain Biscuit which for those who have been there is a great place for breakfast.   I order two biscuit sandwiches, one to eat and to go!  The travel today was a wet one with a large scattered storm throughout the southeast and mid-Atlantic area.  Stopped in Monticello, NY to refuel before making the final leg to Millinocket, ME where I will get a shuttle back to Rangeley and will stay the night at the Hiker Hut.  Great stay and absolutely wonderful people that run the Hiker Hut.  For dinner they served spinach,sausage ravioli bake and for dessert a pumpkin spice cake with chocolate bites and fresh whipped cream. Ummhh!  I slept in an adorable single Hut big enough for a bed, a side table and my backpack.  It had started to rain a little last night but Steve the host, made a fire and drew some of the other hikers out of the bunk room Hut. I also went out and enjoyed the warmth of the fire but soon was back in my Hut sound a sleep. I woke early and had a cup of coffee and Steve made me some eggs and toast for breakfast.  After paying my bill I was packed, said my goodbyes and was walking the 0.3 miles back to the Trailhead.  The trail was wet, muddy and slippery from last nights rain.  The forecast is suggesting more rain later today. Hiked up Saddleback Mountain, Saddleback Junior and the Horn.  Unfortunately the clouds were still thick and low so visibility was not good at the peaks but I did get a few pictures as the clouds broke up momentarily.  Hiked down into a ravine and then back up a modestly steep trail where it was paralleling a waterfall. The waterfall was unique in one way in that it was very narrow and had gouged out a relatively straight line down the mountain and the water was moving super fast.  Stopped at the Spaulding Mountain Lean-to.  When I arrived there was a group of about 10-12 boys and some older leaders that had started to make up their tent sites.  They told me there was another group coming to camp here too, so I decided I was going to find the one other designated tent site immediately off the trail, away from the lean-to and away from the madness that was going occur when another 10-12 young folks should up to camp.   I also know the hikers that were at the the Hiker Hut last night were heading to this spot too.  Going to be a busy place tonight.","Hiker Hut

Hiked up a steep trail to the South and North Crocker Mountain summits. Then a long descent to ME Route 27 where I hitched into town for a few days of snacks. When I left home this last time I brought enough dinners to get me to Monson but only had enough day time snacks to last two days.  Stratton will be the last resupply before Monson. 
A lot of south bounders this morning but mostly out for a week hike or so.  Also met two groups of boys and girls from Quebec hiking for about a week as well.  Met Lady and Tramp camping at the river. Both are from FL and were flip-flopping from TN.  Just before getting to the Route 27 trailhead I passed a make-shift sign on the ground spelling out ""2,000"". When I checked my Guthook app, I confirmed that I was really at the 2,000 mile mark from Springer Mountain, GA. Wow, another big milestone in the books!  Once down at the Trailhead I started walking to Stratton and attempting to hitch hike.  Didn't take long and a man in a pick up stopped for me.  Told him I was looking to get into town to buy a few days of food and lunch. After talking with him, I found out he and his family own the convenience store I was trying to get to.  Small world. I had a great lunch and resupplied for a few days to get me to Monson, ME.  While shopping fir my re-supply and my hands full of food, two older ladies asked me if I wanted their fries and I said that I had just had a big lunch but appreciated their kindness. One lady said she knows most hikers are hungry all of the time.  I said that I am one of them, ask my wife.   
While in town I wanted to check my email and found that there was big news in the family today, Natalie and Owen had their first child today, Leo Nicholas Owen. Congrats to all!  I guess that makes me a great uncle or something like that.  After lunch and resupply, I headed out and on the way back to the Trailhead (about 6-7miles) I wasn't having very good luck hitching a ride so I started walking. Finally got a hitch from a landscaper but only got 1/2 mile where his house was located.  So I started walking again and an older lady pick me up and took me to the trailhead.  Upon arriving there I notice one of the two ladies I had seen back at the store and she said her friend had dropped her off so that she could come back for me since they had no room in their car.  Wow, talk about trail magic and generous spirit both of these ladies had today!  Thank you ladies very much  Pretty steep climb up from route 27 but the scenery was worth it in the large moss covered boulders and thick forest.  Met a family with a several younger kids coming down the steep sections all talking French. When I said I, they acknowledged but kept on going.   I guess this area is popular with Quebec-French speaking folks as well.  I had two spectacular views of the Horn mountain summits with the last with Horn lake in the foreground (pictures). I knew my campsite was just to the right of the pond so pace quickened so I could get down there and enjoy the water after setting up my camp.  There is at least two groups of younger groups here but they are camping in the group space which is farther away.","Spaulding Mountain Lean-to

Walked down to Horns Pond with my freshly brewed via coffee to enjoy the view.  Met QuickStart who was a flip-flopped and home in south jersey.  Hiked up North and South Horn mountains, then Bigelow West Peak and lastly Bigelow Avery Peak.  Beautiful 360 degree views.  Clouds were coming in but you could still see 20 miles.  
Discovered some small blueberries on the trail coming down from Bigelow.  They were really small but I kept stopping to grab a handful.  Found several more areas where the blueberries were rip fir the picking. 
Got caught in real downpour in the middle of the afternoon.  Put on my rain jacket but not my rain pants since it wasn't a cold blowing rain.  Mistake!   As the rain came down, it all ran down my legs onto my socks and filled up my shoes.  I sloshed around in those wet socks and shoes for he next several hours and probably will tomorrow. Having my rain pants on would have shed the water over my socks and around my gators and would have minimized the water in my shoes.  When I was about 2 miles away from what I had read in Guthook as a likely stealth tentsite near East Carry Pond, the sky turned black again and started to rumble with thunder.  I hurried my pace but the wet rocks, roots and mud really slowed me down but I did get to the stealth spot just before the bottom dropped out.  I wanted to go as far as I could today and be in striking distance of the Kennebec River so I could get a ferry ride across during normal hours.  The ferry is free and sponsored by the ATC, MATC and the dam operator and is a single canoe guided by a guy named Greg.  I have seen pictures of the canoe and it has a white blaze in the bottom of the hull and takes two hikers across the river.  I am told there is a queue of a line on both sides of the river so I need to add that to my timeline tomorrow.  Got my tent up and everything stowed away as the rain storms moved on past me.  I washed my muddy legs in the pond where I had camped about 20 feet away.  Very scenic spot looking across the water.  They say this is a pond but where I come from this is a lake.  Looking forward to dinner and unwinding tonight.  Cooked up two dinners and ate on a boulder at the pond waterfront and watched the sun set.  Great way to close out a day on the AT.","Horns Pond lean-to

I have been told my several locals that the weather in the NE has been unseasonably wet and colder for this part of the year.  The big event I was looking forward to today was crossing the river in the ferry.  The Kennebec River was about 10 miles from camp and only operated a few hours each day so I hustled along this morning g to make it in time.  I have also heard that lines can start to queue up on both sides of the river (NOBO, SOBO) The great part about the ferry is it's a canoe with one operator.  The canoe also has a white blaze emblazoned in the bottom just so you know you are still in the official trail!  Two hikers go with the operator and I got paddle up front, so I got a great view of the crossing.   After a short hike from the river, I stopped in the Catarina B&B for an early lunch. There was several hikers checking out and checking in, I just wanted to eat.  I ordered what they were known for, pulled pork sandwich and a chocolate milkshake.  Also had a cherry baked good that looked delicious.  I sat outside and devoured all of it.  Everything was as advertised and very good.  After I payed, I headed back to the trail with a full stomach. I wasn't looking forward to the climb.  Hiked up Pleasant Pond Mountain under an overcast sky.  Once on top, I wasn't sure if it was going to again or not. I can hear motor boats down on the lake with kids having a good time skiing or tubing.  I miss our time on our lake in north Georgia and looking forward to getting back on the boat.  The rest of the afternoon was going up and down shirt sections of trail, so easy, some not do much.  Later in the day I heard the rumblings of mire thunderstorms heading my direction so I started to dial up my hiking pace so that I could arrive at my target before the rain started.  Well, didn't quite make it but the rain held off long enough so I could I set up my camp.  Then the storms seem to move in another direction and the evening became more of a pleasant breeze knocking the rain drops onto my tent.   
Stopped at Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to.  Tomorrow the goal will be to get into Monson and get ready for the 100 mile wilderness.  One food related item I forgot to mention earlier was that for this last segment of my journey I only brought freeze dried food made in Maine.  The company is only a few years old and the owner is a former chef from NY who fell in love with a hiker and moved to Maine.

On the way down I banged my left knee pretty good and was sore the rest of the day. Forded two rivers where I changed out of my hiking boots into my camp shoes so could keep everything somewhat dry. Worked out well and the water wasn't too deep.  I had heard stories from other SOBO's that said after a good rain that they had to camp overnight wait for the water level to come down or walk a mile or do along the banks to find a shallower crossing.  The overcast skies stayed with me all day but didn't rain.  Also ran into an ATC trail-runner from Monson who was walking her route Monson-Caratunk to look over the trail, talk to hikers and probably pick up trash if she found any.    Frankly, I have been impressed by the lack of trash along the trail, the problem is at the shelters and the fire pits.  
Made it to the Monson Trailhead in the middle of the afternoon and called the Lakeshore House for a p/u.  By the time she arrived three other hikers piled in for a ride into town and they eventually all stayed.  I started my chores and then ran over to the ATC office to talk about Baxter.  There isn't many options as to where to stay as there is a maximum of 12 long-distance hikers allowed each night at the ""Birches"".  So I sill need to camp very close the night before I intended to camp in Baxter so I can have a better chance at getting one of the 12 spots. Getting a pass to hike Katahdin, is the easy part, camping the night before will be the challenge.  My goal is to camp Friday night and the summit Katahdin on Saturday.  Hope the weather and camping gods are looking over me this week.  
Tomorrow I will start the 100 mile wilderness and come out right at Baxter State Park where Katahdin is located.  I mailed myself enough food to make the 100 mile hike (I hope) to the hostel I am staying at tonight.

She was sad that she was not going to summit with her friends; Hippo and FD.  Hippo is from Germany and is 59 and is recovering from a stroke on his right side. He speaks good English but sometimes struggles to find the right word. We had breakfast together at Pete's Place and got to hear his story.  Four of us got a shuttle back to the trailhead about 7:45 am. Hippo, Chipolte, Grams and I all started together but quickly started to spread out.  Hippo was going 10-12 miles, I was going 19 and the other two young bucks were shooting for almost 30!  
Passed the Upper Falls which were striking and lots of water descending a steep fall.  
Passed FD who was slack packing SOBO this morning after saying goodbye to Fearless (a lady around early 60's) as she was heading to the bus for a ride to Bangor and then home to Bradenton, FL.  (Nancy & Phil, their favorite restaurant is the one in Bradenton with the manager who likes to give Phil a hard time ) FD said her foot looked worse this morning so a good decision to go home and heal up. I forded 3 creeks/rivers; Little and Big Wilson creek and Thompson Brook.  Two of the crossings I made without getting wet, but third I had to change into camp shoes and made it across in knee deep water.  
I was leap-frogging with Grams (from German) and Chipolte (Oregon) both who were in their early 20's and had also hiked the PCT.  We all stopped at what is called Trail Magic cabin which is close to the base of Barren Mountain and he caters to all hikers with the offer of free food and drink.  As soon as we arrived he put on a hotdog and a burger on the grill for each of us and told us to help ourselves to sodas or beer.  The hunting cabin was small but very comfortable and the host was very generous with what he had.  By the time I left, several other hikers had arrived and everyone was delighted with what this man was offering.  The hosts name is Birdman and his dad Scout. Scout lost his son Yogi Bear - AT '92 and the trail magic they offer is in tribute to him. Since they started in 2013, they have served over 500+ hikers each year and operate from June to October each year.  They also spend 1-2 hours each day hand picking blueberry, blackberry and raspberry all to give out to hikers.  Pretty awesome !  The three of us left reluctantly and started our way up Barren Mountain and the Ledges. It had turned out to be a beautiful day and we were greeted to stunning view at the Ledges. Grams and Chipolte were heading out as they still had a long way to go (they average 30 miles a day) but my tentsite was only a few miles away so I decided to stay a little longer.  I did get a mobile signal at the Ledges so I called home because I didn't think i would be able to during the hike through the 100 mile wilderness.  
Made it to the turn off for the Cloud Pond shelter/tentsite which indicated a .4 mile walk off trail. I usually don't do that but thought this was the right time of day to stop.  Wow, the setting at Cloud Pond was spectacular.  There was a few hikers there but everyone was just in awe of the naturally beautiful setting we were all in.  I found a great tentsite looking directly out into the pond (lake) and watched the sunset while eating dinner.  Nice way to end the day.  Tonight I am 95.3 miles from Katahdin.  Wow, it's really getting close now.","Monson, ME

Forded the West Branch Pleasant River which had more people in each side then I would have imagined.  Most folks were south bound and they were either taking their boots off and putting their camp shoes or they were drying their feet and putting their boots back on.  I had talked to other SOBO's weeks ago and they said that some if the river crossings in the 100 mile were so bad that they camped on the side of the river to allow the water level to come down.  I have not seen anything like that in my crossings and hope it stays that way.  
After the crossing, it was a slow steady ascent up to Carl Newhall lean-to and then a very steep climb up to Gulf Hagas Mountain.  Stopped at the Sidney Tappan Campsite which didn't have a view or anything special except that it was before the next three peaks which will be the last significant climbs before Katahdin.  So after banging my right knee cap into a rock earlier this morning, I am sore and tired.  So this campsite is just what the doctor ordered.  A few other hikers decided to camp here as well including a father and daughter team (Lula-Bell and Piper).

Bazinga called me over for a photo of a great sunrise over the lake.  It Was one if the better sunrises of the whole trail.  The three other hikers were all gone when I left camp this morning after 6:00 am. While hiking, I heard a working sawmill in the distance and wondered how that whole industry was doing as I heard at an early trail town that most of the paper pulp and timber mills had shut down. 
Walked across a lot of cut timber bridges that were wet, slick and very easy to slip on so I took my time on him.

Passed the Pataywadjo Ridge and should have had a view of Katahdin over the Pemadumcook Lake but there was too many clouds in the way.  
The trail actually walks along portions of the shore line of Nahmakanta lake.  Great views but you need to watch your step on the slick rocks. Most of the camping in this area is in Maine Bureau of Public Lands. 
Hiked up Nesuntabunt Mountain which provided a great view of the lake below and a great view of Katahdin.  As I have read in Guthook, from this point I am only 16 miles from the famed mountain but the AT takes 35 miles to get there. Pass Crescent Pond.   Hiked along Rainbow Stream where you can see some scenic sluices and cascading falls.  Pass more bogs along the trail.  I haven't mentioned them much in the my past journals but there have been a lot of bogs in Maine.  Some bogs look like beavers have caused them, whereas others look like they may have always been there.

Visa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575467,"Left early this morning with Bazinga (pictured) and we had a quick hike to the Baxter State Park entrance.  I was personally concerned about getting to the entrance as soon as I could so that I could get one of twelve daily camping spots at ""The Birches"".  This campsite is only for long-distance hikers who have crossed through the 100 mile wilderness.  Nothing special about the Birches as it's just two jean-to's and a few spots for tenting.  Since all of the other campgrounds were full, if you could not get into the the Birches, you would be required to camp outside boundaries which was a 10 mile hike.  Along the way we hiked around several lakes and more bogs.  The trail was still full of rocks, roots and mud but overall not too bad.  We also forged three creeks one of which I decided to take a quasi-swim in as I misjudged a slippery rock and one foot and shoe went in deep.  I was not happy with my self but it happened so fast I am not sure how I could have prevented it. We walked into Abol Bridge store but the restaurant didn't open until 11 and it was only 9:30 so we decided to move up to the Baxter State Park kiosk and see if we could run into a ranger or even better get on the list for the Birches. When we arrived at the kiosk, there was a ranger there that was very helpful and found that there was plenty of room at the Birches, so we signed up.  Next stop was the final 9 miles to the Katahdin Stream Campground and the ranger station where I officially got my permit to hike Katahdin. My official permit number was #388 NOBO thru-hiker for 2017.  One hiker ahead of us was in a hurry and had been following/passing us all morning, was hiking Katahdin this afternoon as he had a flight out of Boston tomorrow night.  I am glad I wasn't in that kind of rush as the 21 miles we hiked today was plenty and I was ready to rest. There was a large group of hikers that came into the ranger station after we had registered.   One of the ladies, Pudge, in that group remembered me from The Notch Hostel in North Woodstock.  Bazinga and I hiked to our campsite and started setting up our tents and getting ready for dinner.  Bazinga had a different schedule than I did as he was not summiting until Monday (total eclipse day). One of his AT 2013-2015 hiking friends was flying/driving from Virginia to Maine specifically to summit with him since they had spent so much time on the AT and had grown to be good friends over the years.  The AT has a funny way of making great friends out of complete strangers along the way.  Bazinga and I shared a lot of stories about each other over our dehydrated Good-To-Go meals and I will enjoy celebrating tomorrow night with him after I summit this highest point in Maine and the northern terminus of the AT.  
As you can imagine a lot of the last many months of hiking memories are flooding back into my mind tonight and I am anxious for this big climb tomorrow. It's only 5.2 miles from the base of the mountain to the peak but it is very steep (over 4,000 feet of elevation gain) and above the tree line most of the way.  We were told by the rangers that it is a 8-12 hour round trip hike for most hikers. The weather forecast is good and hope we get a reasonably clear day for some great photo's. 
So tonight is the last night on the Appalachian Trail and I have throughly enjoyed every one of the past 110 hiking days.  Tomorrow my AT journey will end at the summit and will be in the town of Millinocket by tomorrow evening.","Rainbow Stream campground

Visa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575468,"Had somewhat of a restless night thinking about the final summit tomorrow and the end of this great adventure.  I left the the Birches Campsite and was at the ranger station by 6:45 and hiking by 7:09.  You hike the Hunt Trail which is also the final 5.2 miles of the Appalachian Trail.  The weather was a but I've rated but dry.  First stop was the Katahdin Stream Falls which was running hard and quite beautiful. The milestone was the treeline which was about 2,000 feet above the where I started from the ranger station.  Next stop was The Hunt Spur, then the Gateway and finally the peak of Katahdin. It took about 2:30 minutes to hike up and stayed about an hour.  Their were several sections where I was pulling myself to the next handhold or foot placement and was almost a very technical hike except no ropes. There was only two other hikers at the top and one of them was a thru-hiker I met yesterday.  I had my picture taken in many different poses around the famous Katahdin Peak sign and thoroughly enjoyed looking out in the endless horizon at the beautiful views from the top.  I also really enjoyed watching other hikers come to the peak in full emotion and hugging all of their fellow hikers.  After calling home (yes I had Verizon signal from the summit) and thanking my wife for her support in my AT hike, I started down. I met several other hikers; Pick'it, Crazy Larry, Tank, Toe and others.  The rain had started to come in slightly which made for wet granite rocks in a very steep descent so I took it slow and was able to make it down without adding to any more of my injuries .  Got a shuttle in to the AT Lodge, where I am staying the next two nights to recuperate, eat a lot of real food and possibly a few cold beers.   
I will post in a day or two to recap my great journey but for those that have followed me on TJ, I really appreciate it.  I made it!","The Birches

Visa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575582,"As I prepare to make my way home tomorrow, I am overcome with gratitude, appreciation and honored to have thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail. 
Thankful for the opportunity to make this ultimate journey but there are many to thank.  Special thanks to all of the great hikers (NOBO, SOBO, Flip-Floppers, Section) I have met and truly enjoyed all of their personal stories and why they are hiking the AT.  I am asked often what my favorite part of hiking the AT and my answer has always been the same and that is the people you meet.  Also thanks goes out to the trail towns, shuttle drivers, hostels, ridge runners, trail maintainers, trail clubs, trail magic and all of the other people who have made this journey so special.  There are also some gear manufacturers/providers that have made my adventure lighter, safer and trouble free so thanks to ZPacks, REI, Delorme InReach, Enlighten and Massdrop.  
I also really appreciate my family members (Joel, Jackson, Rich and Steve) and my fraternity brother (Joe) who came out on the trail to share this journey with me.  Your company made my trip very special and I looked forward to each of your trail arrivals with great anticipation.  I had a great time hiking and camping with each of you and will always remember the memories we created together. 
I save my biggest thanks to my beautiful wife (Paula), daughters (Alex, Katie) and of course the family dog (Mason) for supporting me throughout my AT hike and ""holding down the fort"" until I could return.  I know my family thinks I am crazy with my past journeys but the AT thru-hike tops the list of the most epic and challenging journey I have ever undertaken.  Love you to Katahdin and back!
