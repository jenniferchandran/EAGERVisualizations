We decided to drive to parking lot. Once there we hiked back to the brass southern terminus AT Trail marker. Got some pictures then turned north bound to a adventure started back in the 1970's. I would day hike at Pine Grove PA or Water Gap PA wondered if I would ever hike a thru-hike. With register #1,002 got the rucksack pack ready. Gear cost estimated $900 dollars includes all parts clothing food and the rest. My friend cost almost 5 times the amount. Forecast followed closely. Tented 1st night. Clean self with witch-hazel in baby wipes. Switched out trail cloths with sleeping cloths i have a cotton t-shirt just for that purpose I feels perfect to sleep in. Accordion pad very uncomfortable I sleep on my side.","Springer Mountain 3/25/2016

cleavers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547804,"Bike ride the Schuylkill River Trail in Philadelphia Pennsylvania with wife. We get home and drink refreshingly. As I sit on the back deck watching the sun set and stars come out I wonder at the trail the Appalachian Trail in Springer Mountain. Memory swells up inside of me. That one hike straight up to six thousand feet with steep drop off on either side of the narrow trail. That wonderful feel as I step out on look out with my companion sounding gosh this is great. I could hear myself replying Is this the top. Response No we got another mile. That wonderful trail full of old growth Bay Laurels and Mountain Laurels and Rhododendron (Fire Bush to the locals). Amazed at the stout thick trunk. The ground soil a deep cinnamon brown fresh smells of earthen tones.  Blink back to reality. The stars begin to glow brite as I sip on scotch and ice. Feel no compulsion to camp I feel no compelling notion to build a glowing fire. A certain calm and another sip. I am off the Trail but still feel bound. Wonder if I should take on the AT next year. Oh what I would do differently. Maybe invest in a hammock. Doctor issued shoes or trail runners. I am still investigating the Food issue on the trail. Most reads have Complex Carbohydrates and High Carbs on the same sentence. Low Carbs and Fibers and Proteins and  {Unhealthy high carbohydrate foods include sugary cereals, crackers, cakes, flours, jams, preserves, bread products, refined potato products, and sugary drinks.    {Healthy high carbohydrate foods include vegetables, legumes (beans), whole grains, fruits, nuts, and yogurt.On top of this list thru hikers evaluate weight to carry.Continue hike continue bike - just have fun.","Schuylkill River Trail
