Slug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525826,"Well, my departure time is rapidly approaching. Saturday April 2nd is my launch day. Most of you know that I'm headed out for a journey of a lifetime by hiking Appalachian Trail in its entirety, all 2189 miles of it. I'm very thankful I have this opportunity, most people sit at work only ever dreaming of something like this. I understand most people will think I'm crazy for leaving my family, friends, and my job behind but after losing my wife Christa Ryerson on Christmas Eve 2014 I've come to realize something, this life is but a blink of an eye, here today gone tomorrow. Life is to precious to waste on daily grid. Living my life like each day is my last is my intention. This hike is something I've wanted to do after reading ""A walk in the woods"" by Bill Bryson...so I'm doing it.Sidenote: for those who are wondering why my Facebook post is also in here, it's because other hikers who use this journal website can read this journal as well.

Slug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527080,"Day 1 - Anthony and I arrived early to Amicalola Falls State Park thanks to Brandon my brother-in-law, after regestoring for my thru-hike we set off up the 604 steps to the top of the water fall after walking 8.8 miles we reached Springer Mountain where we got some great pictures and signed the hidden journal behind the plaque set in stone. We walked another .2 miles to get to the Springer Mountain Shelter where we set up our first camp site, there were easy 70+ people camping for the night. We met some fellow hikers due to the fact they had a fire going and we didn't a spot for one. After dark it was time for sleep.Day 2 - After a night of hardly any sleep due to the fact I forgot my sleeping pad... We set off, the scenery is beautiful it's hard to believe that scenes like this are so close to so many people and yet hardly anyone will make the effort to see them. After about 2 ish hours of hiking and around 4 miles into our hike we came across what hikers call trail magic at Cooper Gap where we had free hugs(Anthony hid from the girl trying to hug him) and free food. A bunch of people gathered together eating hotdogs and drinking Dr Pepper in the middle of the woods, what more could someone ask for. They had a little enclosed trailer where all the thru hikers got to thank them by signing it. Reaching Gooch Mountain Shelter was the goal for the day and we got there pretty fast and set up camp for the second time each time getting easier. Day 3 - Sleeping is rough without a mat and Anthony has started to give me the trail name Matless which I'm not a fan of but hey! We met some people that are walking at the same pace as us, one of them go by the name Slice because last year he was on the PCT and cut himself pretty bad on accident, and another guy carrying a 50+ pound pack...loaded with camera gear we were talking about trail names and the camera guy didn't have a name yet so Anthony said his name should be Kodak(that name stuck) days later his group was calling him Kodak. Anyway, The scenery changes every day it's amazing really. Ramrock Mountain, Preaching Rock, and Big Cedar Mountain were all scenic views of the day. We stopped at Lance Creek for the day the elevation changed have left my heals in blisters, my knees in pain, and my medkit half empty. Day 4 - Was a butt kicker although it was only 8 miles, the elevation gains and losses were brutal. We started at 2865 ft and up Blood Mountain Shelter it was up to 4457 ft then at Neel Gap our stopping point was back down to 3125ft coming back down off Blood Mountain was pretty much rock hopping. Once we got to Neel Gap we were at the Mountan Crossing Outfitter where we got some food and planned to get a ride to town to stay the night in a hotel to get some sleep and resupply. After calling a bunch of places we found a place in Blairsville GA that had a room for us. We got a ride into Blairsville by a guy named Sam who is well known in the hiker community, he was pretty entertaining after telling the same story twice back to back we were starting to wonder about about this guy but he was funny and he only charged us 30 bucks there and back again the next day so we weren't about to complain. Day 5 - Getting back to the trail was refreshing and knowing all the sights to see on this day was exciting. Levelland Mountain, Wolf Laurel Top, Cowrock Mountain, and Wildcat Mountain all with scenic views and great pictures we stopped at White Oak Stamp and after hiking up and down 5 mountains it was a welcome sight. For the first time we had a site to ourselves. It rained off and on but that didn't stop us from getting a fire going. It rained though the night and was cold in the morning. Day 6 - We decided to push today making it our longest yet over 13 miles but the reason for the push Holly was picking us up at Unicoi Gap and take us back to Greenville where Anthony could stop his hike and I could take a zero day and heal up a little while letting this cold front go through. We did over 60 miles in 7 days not bad for a couple old guys. This rest is much needed.","Amicalola Falls State Park

Slug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527883,"4/11 - Today was a long day for me mostly down hill which is killer on my bum knee and one brutal up hill. I met a lot of awesome people last night at Trey Mountain Shelter twinke, daddy long legs, metaphor and more I just can't remember their names yet. I hiked to Dicks Creek Gap where I booked a bunkroom at Top of Georgia Hostel. I met up with people that Anthony and I had made friends with Seltzer, and Nila where they were taking a couple of zeros to heal up. The others Slice and Kodak(Anthony gave this kid his trail name due to the fact he had camera gear out the wazoo and he was constantly taking our picture: without permission lol) were staying in Hiawassee and I didn't get to see them but I heard from Seltzer that Kodak who was sporting a 55lb pack got a shack down at the outfitters and is now down to 37lbs good for him that may just save his hike. I met a ton of people at the hostel a guy called Blisters was recouping due to having blisters on every square inch of the bottoms of both feet. A girl from Texas named Casey Jones I asked her if it had to due wirh Grateful Dead song or the Ninja Turtles but I knew from her lip piercings and blue hair it was probably the Grateful Dead...I was right. I would like to stay at that hostel again it was nice.","Trey Mountain Shelter

Slug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527971,"4/12 - Walked from Dicks Creek Gap to Plumorchard Gap Shelter it was a short day a little less than 5 miles. I needed a short day after putting in a lot yesterday. I got a free ride from the Hostel to the trail head from ""Sam Don't Give A Damn"" who gave Anthony and I a ride into Blairsville a week ago he remember me and started to tell me the same story that he told us 2 times on the way into town and 1 times on the way back. God Bless him. Well this is the first shelter I signed into on my thru hike. I met more people today a guy named Marty McFly he was drinking a bottle of Evan Williams like it was water, not sure if he's going to make it if he drinks like that every night. Metaphor is here again and I learned he's former Navy and and had to quit due to drugs...not sure if he means dishonorable discharge but hey judge not right? I met a lady named Trail Mix who is an older lady but still acts young anyway she's from Illinois and just moved to Vermont because her sister wanted to go there and she hated her job so she quit and moved 2 weeks later she decided to hike the AT. A guy named poler bear and twinke were taking about Carolina Panthers around the fire tonight made me think of my oldest friend Victor, they're both from Charlotte and were complaining about the miserable Super Bowl. When I told them I was a Detroit Lions fan they laughed and said ""I thought we had something to complain about"" Anyway I've realized I need to journal more, so from here on out every night before bed I'll write my journal and try to remember everything that happens.","Dicks Creek Gap

I started off by heading out of Plumorchard Gap shelter by 930am and started north bound, the first person I see is Metaphor...hiking past me at an incredible rate as he flew by I hear ""Walked 2 and a half miles in the wrong direction!!!, so I ate a snickers and now I'm no longer pissed about it"" lol. Today I got to check a state off my list goodbye Georgia 13 more states to go. 8ish miles later I camp at Muskrat Creek Shelter there isn't a lot of people here yet but there was two horses a dog and about 4 state rescue policeman with a man who was just saved after two days of no food and who fell off the side of the AT. Glad they found him. People started to roll in after the rescue team was getting ready to leave, most people I've meet before and have talked in this journal everyone wanted details so I was telling the story like 10 times. After dinner and campfire I'm off to bed good night.","Plumorchard Gap

Slug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527981,"4/14 - Today I hiked from Muskrat Creek Shelter to Carter Gap Shelter just over 12 miles. It was a beautiful day in the woods, I stopped for a break after reaching my goal of 4 miles in 2 hours and immediately took my boots off and let my feet breathe. There was 2 men sitting in the shade and one was on the phone with it sounded like the hospital so I started to ease drop and his throat was closing or he said he was having a hard time breathing I asked his friend if he had any Benadryl and he said they didn't gave any so I offered him some and he told me not to worry about it...I guess it must not have been that important. After about 45 minutes I laced up my boots and hit the path again, Standing Indian Mountain is unbelievable it stands over 5400 feet high and the climb/decent is not that bad. I walked about 5 miles and stopped again for a shorter 25 minutes rest and snack. Potatos(from Germany), Blisters, and NTL(never to late) with his dog Hiccup were handing out in the same spot. We all just sat around and small talked while rubbing our feet and nursing wounds, you do that a lot out here. After I started walking again I caught up with Tortoise and learned he was from Greer not to far from Greenville. Finally arriving to camp I hiked a little over 12 miles in 7 hours. After making camp I was eating with a bunch of people around a campfire which we call Caveman TV now thanks to NTL and found out that Potatos is turning 24 on Saturday and wanting to have a party in Franklin NC so we're going to push 12ish miles tomorrow and will only have 4 to go so we get into town early on Saturday so that he can have his first birthday party in the states. After food and warming up I headed off to journal and sleep.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

I got a chance to climb up to a Fire Watch tower, it was hand over hand climbing at some points but the view from the tower was worth the climb. Tomorrow we're waking up early so we can get to Franklin, NC early and catch a shuttle from Winding Stair Gap.","Carter Gap Shelter

Slug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528486,"4/16 - So staying in the Rock Gap shelter was a horrible mistake, 1 snoring people, 2 mice running over my body, and 3 the angle of the floor was like a tilt table...never again. Ok so now that I've complained the morning turned out to be awesome, Potatos, NTL with his dog Hiccup, Mclovin, and myself all got an early start and hiked the 3.7 miles into Winding Stair Gap to catch a shuttle to Franklin, we waited for a bit and decided to try hitching a ride instead. It took about 10 minutes before someone in a truck told us to climb in and hold on...the scenery was amazing unlike anything I've seen yet. She dropped us off at a Bojangles for breakfast I didn't complain I made my monster biscuit and devoured it. NTL and Hiccup were getting off the trail and getting a free ride from a friend back to Indiana.(going to miss that guy he was awesome) The place we were staying was across town about 3 miles so we started walking and a lady in a BMW SUV pulled over and told us to get in and started asking the usual stuff, she sold Real estate and told us about the town very nice lady. She dropped us off where we needed to go which was the budget inn and across the street is where I stayed in a place called the penny pincher hiker Den. Great place for the price $40 for a single room all to myself. SLEEP!!! After a nap I went to a brewery called the Lazy Hiker Brewery, very cool spot and good beer. After getting supplies at dollar general and ingles I set off back to the room. I went to a free hiker party with food and beer and had a great time meeting new people. Bedtime thank God.","Rock Gap Shelter

Slug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528817,"4/17 - Sleeping in my own bed without people around me snoring their brains out was refreshing I slept about 9 hours which is by far the most I've had since I left Greenville. I didn't do a lot to be honest but that was by design. For lunch Potatos and Blisters who recently got a new name (Twisted) because it wasn't just blisters holding him off the trail it was sprained ankle and a stye in his right eye, poor kid. Anyway, we went to a place called Motor City Cafe it reminded me of Johnny Rockets. I ordered a special hamburger that had everything it, it was huge I could only eat half of this thing. After that took a nap for 2 more hours, woke up resupplied in town and sat outside almost the whole rest of the day talking with fellow hikers about life on the trail. That night we made a short trip to a sports bar called Mulligans because Potatos wanted to go to one for the first time and I wanted to see the Detroit Redwings play in their 3rd playoff game and I think they won but are still down 2-1. Time for bed tomorrow I hit the trail again.","Franklin NC

After eating a huge breakfast I left The Budget Inn Ron Harper owner and operator of both the Budget Inn and the Penny Pincher Hiker Den (he's a nice man) drove us to Winding Stair Gap where I left off and started walking. I hiked 11 miles today and I got to a different fire tower view and again it was amazing.

I've listened to Harry Potter audio books for the last 2 days and I already finished the 2nd book Chamber of Secrets and started the 3rd Prisoner of Azkaban. I'm the first one to arrive at Wesser and pick the best tent spot about 20 minutes later others started to arrive. It's crazy of few compared to how many are still out here. Peril and Trillium join me for dinner and we talk about how cool it is that she came out here to hike with her boyfriend. She asks me if I had a girl back home and I tell her about Christa.

Slug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529254,"4/20 - Today I hiked from Wesser Bald Shelter to NOC which is about 7 miles but the down hill going into the NOC was brutal on my knee, nothing a little Alive wouldn't fix. I talked to a guy in Franklin about a free campsite here and couldn't find it to save my life. I was getting ready to book a room at the hostel when a familiar face came running up to me, it was Nilla! she told me there was free camping and since she was headed there anyway to follow her and she would show me where it was. After setting up my tent and settling down I went to take a shower and low and behold... The shower was $.25 per minute, I put a $1.25 in coin machine and warm water came out for 5 minutes. The structure that the showers were in was made of wood and full of holes... I didn't care at all, it weirdest shower I've ever taken so far but it was great none the less. After showering I did laundry and while waiting bought a six pack of calories(beer) and downed two before I thought, I probably need to eat before I drink another one. After my clothes were done I dropped all my stuff of at the tent and Nilla and I went back into the little village where they have a general store, 2 restaurants, outfitter, and a activity center for white water rafting and kayaking. We set foot into the restaurant and my hunger kicked in pretty good didn't realize how hungry I was, I set my eyes on The Tail of the Dragon a hamburger with fresh jalapeños and a homemade spicy ranch sauce and fries, it was so good. After eating we set off the campsite again while it was semi light out still and we noticed someone else setup camp next to my tent, more the merrier. We stayed out until 930 ish to meet this person but they never showed time for bed.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Slug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529255,"4/21 - Today I decided to take another zero day because Nilla was going to wait for Potatos and Twisted to catch up I thought that was a good idea since they walk around the same pace as me and have a lot in common. Waiting around is not so bad when you're not paying for a room every night. So first thing on my mind, breakfast lol Shocker I know. So, we go to breakfast and I ordered something called The Class V Breakfast reading the words on the page was exciting because just reading it, it sounded big but when they sat all the food in front of my I quickly realized I called down the thunder of all breakfasts, it took up the whole side of my table. I felt both ashamed and pure bliss at the same time. After seeing the food I figured out the ""class five"" reference was a white water kayaking term for the hardest and most dangerous Rapids you can face, my breakfast was all of those things and I ate every bite. After committing gluttony (don't worry, I asked for forgiveness) we sat out and watched all the people kayaking and talked to fellow hikers learning about where they're all from and why they're hiking the AT, Nilla points out this guy who had really creeped her out the day before and sure enough creeping every other girl out that he talked to, after giving this guy the stink eye for a bit we set off down the railroad tracks to our campsite and low a behold guess who's right behind us, Creepy White Guy!!! I was hoping he wasn't the tent next to mine but I already knew it was. Why me? It was the tent next to mine...I asked if Nilla wanted to move but since I was here with her she was cool with staying because it was a really nice spot right off the Rapids. So thinking about this I don't know if I ever told you guys about Nilla, she's from a military family dads in the Army I think. She and her family hiked 700 miles of the AT last year but someone got hurt I can't remember who and since she was only 17 at the time she had to get off the trail with her family. This year her father and brother are ahead of us and her mother is meeting them where they got off the last time and will resume her hike and Nilla wanted to start over and thru hike the whole thing within a year. Side note - Anthony got to meet Nilla on his short time on the trail - end note. She got her name because she had a bottle of vanilla hand sanitizer explode in her pocket, twice. Anyway so creepy white camping next to me...just talking to this guy creeped me out constantly changing his stories talking about how all these girls are his friends blah enough to make your skin crawl. I wanted to throw him in the river and watch him float away never return but jail isn't an adventure I'm wanting to run into haha. I feel like I'm becoming Nilla's big brother which is pretty cool she reminds me of me at that age a little bit. After creeper leaves we head back to the picnic tables and meet more people and play around with all the thru hiking dogs to many names to remember until around 6 o'clock while drinking some beer it was a blast. Since my breakfast was so big I wasn't hungry again until around 7 o'clock we went back to the restaurant and I ordered a 10"" Greek Pizza and it was very good too. It's hard to imagine that one restaurant had so many good items on their menu, Nilla got and loved the fish tacos that used Fresh Trout...yes please!!! After dinner we headed back to the campsite and a bunch of people setup tents near us and were hanging out thanks to us telling them where the free camping was. We made a decent fire and then it started to rain ??. Good night","NOC

Was planning on going to Brown a Fork Shelter to day which would have been 9 miles but decided to push past that for the 12 mile mark to insert name of gap. Very tired, my feet are killing me, and I couldn't be happier. Saw a lady quit today she and her friend had been planning this for over a year and she had her daughter pick her up at the gap where the road intersected with the trail, now it's just one lady named Susan she's kinda sad that her friend left her but she did say she feels a little more free and can go further now. Good for her. Met an 18 year old kid that hikes 20+ miles per day his name is Frozen Taters(he doesn't carry a stove and eats everything cold). I tried this for a week and it sucked. His brother hiked the trail last year after high school and now it was his turn. Nilla turned in early a lot earlier than she normally does. Met a guy named Thor but the funny thing is that's his real name everyone thought it was his trail name and after talking about it we concluded that a trail name is pointless when your real name is freaking Thor. Another guy at the campsites name was Living Proof he was diagnosed with brain cancer and had a tumor removed had a huge scar on his head. Last year he started hiking the trail and not 5 miles from where we stood last year he fell and broke his arm on a steep decent, he restarted the trail and was just passing the spot where his accident was a year ago.

So from Cody Gap to Fontana NC 28 is 9 miles mostly down hill though which for me downs are the worst on my knee. About 1 mile from the NC 28 crossing into Fontana I've never been so beat up in my life, I couldn't walk another step. My feet were shredded, my knee felt like it was coming undone, and I was completely gassed, and that's when I heard Christa telling me to get up, stop mopping, and get to steppin. It was like she was in my head, I heard it as plain as day. It was so real I cried for the first time in a while. So, when I was done feeling sorry for myself, I laughed, I picked my 36lb pack up, and slung it over my shoulders; Strapped in and headed north. Getting to the lodge was great met up with Thor and he asked me if I wanted to split a room with him so naturally I said yes, and I'm glad I did Thor is a very cool guy someone who after a few minutes of talking with him felt like we had been friends for a long time. That night I had dinner with Thor, Nilla, Casey and Kate a couple that stayed at Cody Gap with us. Casey is from Oklahoma he's a pretty crazy dude,fun loving, care free, and in his late 20's ish. Kate is a surgical nurse who quit her job knowing that she will immediately get hired at another hospital whenever she wants to go back to work I'm not sure where's she from but they met out here on the trail and they seem to be having a blast together, good for them.

Breakfast was amazing I ate something called Hillbilly Eggs Benedict (2 biscuits as a base layer with a lot of sausage gravy poured over the top, 2 sausage patties on top of the biscuits, then 2 eggs over medium over the sausage) I could eat this every day of my life. Thor and Nilla got the same thing as me and Susan who also ate breakfast with us got something else. As we all ate breakfast we talked about our plans for the day and Nilla broke the news that she got a call last night that her 12 year old brother wants to get off the trail, her brother and father are ahead of us almost out of the Smokies. This morning she's planning on jumping ahead to meet up with them to talk her brother out of quitting. Thor is taking he's 2nd zero so he's staying to heal up a little bit. He is experiencing numbness in his right leg from his knee to his foot and the blister he got from yesterday's down is pretty bad looking. Susan and I talked about buying food at the resupply in Fontana and shopping to a lady that will deliver the food at whatever time you setup that way we don't have to carry 8 days worth of food at one time, saving our backs from 8+ lbs of food, so we did that. After getting all the stuff squared away we said our goodbyes then got on the shuttle and headed back to the trail. Today was rough all up hill but got to climb a fire tower that was open at the top but to be honest probably should be closed and torn down its not 100% safe but I climbed to the top anyway. Got to Birch Spring Gap 8ish miles for the day it's straight up and we started late around 130. Susan I got to know a little better she's divorced and remarried her kids live with their father in Greenville SC but she lives in NC. I asked her how her husband felt about her being out here alone but if you read my Cody Gap entry she wasn't alone until her friend quit. She said he's very supportive about her being out here, I don't know how I'd feel about it probably not very supportive lol. Anyway got to camp and ate my dinner and got ready for bed.

I mentioned that I was running low on propane and he let me use his can of gas to cook my food on. So...Shelter life isn't at all fun so slept in my tent because I can't stand sleeping in Shelters because of all the noise, farting, snoring, and all the damn mice that run around. I don't know if I've mentioned this before but in the Smokies if there's room you have to sleep in the shelters due to bear activity so needless to say I haven't slept very much.

During my hike I caught up with Guyia (not a clue how to spell this but it's Mother Earth) She got her name due to the fact that she pacts out all the trash people leave lying around the trails and the shelters which equates to a lot of freaking trash. She carries a scale with her so she can see how much waste she can get on a thru hike. For those of you that don't know it's not like there's a trash bin at every shelter she has to pack all that weight for days before a trash can shows up. She's from Minnesota and has the typical accent, it makes me laugh, but in a good way. On the way down to the shelter I hear a bunch of people yelling and all of a sudden it started to rain and I thought maybe they could see me and were telling me to hurry up so I start to run down the steep trail and I turn the corner and there's a black bear running away from me. Not going to lie I panicked for a second but realized quickly that they were yelling at the bear to go away at the shelter not cheering me on. Once I arrived at the shelter they told me that the bear has been acting aggressively towards them and then I told them that they scared the bear right at me, they were sorry they scared the bear at me but were relived when I told them the bear ran away from the shelter into the woods. It poured ran all night long. A hiker by the name of Smoke Jr gave me a pair of ear plugs because I couldn't sleep and Great Day!!! They really helped me sleep.","Mt Collins Shelter

Slug,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531487,"5/2 - Cosby Knob Shelter to Standing Bear Hostel was around 11 miles. Today a new vigor is restored in me today, I'm out of the Smokies!!!, and I get a shower and a bed. Say no more Standing Bear is very interesting, it's all on the honor system. Everyone here is happy to be clean and loaded with beer and pizza. We have a distance paper airplane completion and yours truly won it by a land slide. We sat around telling all kinds of stories and playing music. This is something I've never experienced in my life (complete strangers hanging out together without a care) and I wouldn't trade it for the world. I've been hiking for one month today, it's a crazy thought.","Cosby Knob Shelter
