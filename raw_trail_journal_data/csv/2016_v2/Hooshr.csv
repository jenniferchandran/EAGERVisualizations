Hooshr,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478066,"I moved to Virginia in 2008 from Indiana. Prior to the move I was by no means a hiker. I participated in various sports, i.e., racquetball and running and always looked forward to a challenge, i.e., can I do it. This led me to run marathons, half marathons, 10k, 5K, racquetball tournaments, etc.. My move to Virginia kindled a greater appreciation of outdoor activities. I live within easy driving distance of the AT and proceeded to tackle an ever increasing number of AT day hikes in the Roanoke VA and Southwest VA areas. It didn't hurt that I see McAfee Knob everyday from my deck. This lit the ""spark"" and the commitment to thru hike the AT, i.e., another challenge. I can honestly say I feel a ""calling"" to take on this challenge. I hope to have completed a successful career in corporate America by the end of 2016. I am blessed to have a wife of 35+ years who fully supports my dream. I read everything available regarding the AT, absorb all I can through Trail Journal entries, White Blaze and personal contacts. There is much to learn, but with a two year head start I am confident in my commitment and preparation. I only wish I could start sooner.",,View Entry,"Nov 12, Wed",0

A distance of approximately 8.5 miles. Great views from Dragon's Tooth back toward McAfee Knob. Felt great to get out and push ourselves. The route to Dragon's Tooth involves hand over hand rock climbing the usage of rebar drilled into the rock, but well worth the effort at the top. Nothing like mountain air to recharge and get us ready for the full AT.",,Dragon's Tooth to VA 620,"Nov 24, Mon",0

Today we did an 8 mile hike with 2017 hiking partner ShipShape from Dalevile VA 220 Park and Ride Lot to Hay Rock. It is an 8 mile out and back with climbing early and then ridge walking with views of Carvins Cove. We had a little exitement when we met a gentleman who askedus help him find his dog who had encountered a bear along the AT. One of his dogs had a substantial wound on its neck inflicted by the bear.

We have developed a special friendship.The Roan Highlands, i.e., Little Hump and Big Hump Mountains are a special place. I look forward to visiting again next spring.Regarding equipment - Big Agnes UL Fly Creek 2 works well, changed sleeping pad to a ThermaRest self inflating with 25 inch width. Osprey Atmos 65 AG is a little heavy, but fits me great and can handle a load, especially with cold weather gear.

I stayed at Catawba Shelter on December 11. I got up at 5:30 AM on December 12 and decided to hike the 1.9 miles to McAfee Knob to view sunrise. This was a first for me, i.e., hiking using headlamp. I left the shelter at 6 AM. Fortunately, I had some familiarity with the trail, but you must may close attention to every step to prevent a fall. I made it to McAfee Knob about 6:45 AM for a 7:15 AM sunrise. Was I surprised when I arrived. There must have been 30 -40 people at McAfee Knob, mostly Virginia Tech students. Camping is not permitted on McAfee Knob, but my guess is that this was ignored by a significant number of hikers. Sunrise was good, but not spectacular, but I felt good that I made it for sunrise and did it with headlamp, i.e., another lesson learned for 2016 NOBO.",,Night Hike - Sunrise McAfee Knob,"Dec 16, Wed",0
Hooshr,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518593,"This hike was all about cold weather hiking. We camped at Pond Flats campsite on top of Pond Mountain after a 5 mile hike up from Dennis Cove Road. Beautiful area around Laurel Falls, including a steep descent down a series of rock steps. I am always amazed and impressed with the work that AT trail maintainers perform. There must have been a 100 hand placed/positioned rock steps leading you to Laurel Falls. It would be a great swimming hole in warmer weather. The wind started to pick up and snow flurries started as we begin ascent up Pond Mountain. Big Agnes UL Fly Creek 2 and REI Igneo sleeping bag performed well with the exception of my feet. I wore 2 pair of socks, but feet were cold during the night.It was snowing, windy and a low of 20 degrees. Lesson learned - best thing to do on a cold morning is to get packed as quickly as possible and start hiking as a means to warm up. We descended to Watauga Lake and hiked all day (12.5 miles) with the lake in view on our way to Vandeventer Shelter including a few climbs with many outstanding views.Temperatures in the 40's. Highly recommend Vandeventer Shelter for great cliff views behind the shelter of Watauga Lake. ""Mountain Dew"" and ""Checker"" even had Christmas lights for their tent and presents, including a cold beer. We awoke on December 20 to an outstanding sunrise and on to TN 91 a distance of 11.7 miles. This section of the AT was relatively flat and passed Iron Mountain shelter (lunch) and the Nick Grandstaff Memorial.All in all a great hike with ""Mountain Dew"", ""Checker"" and ""Red Card"". Good experience with colder weather conditions.
Special shout out to ""Sheep Dog"" for her shuttle and outstanding assistance in going above and beyond.

Hooshr,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519166,"My original plan was a 2017 NOBO thru hike. However, the acquisition of my employer impacted my position and created the opportunity to plan and prepare for a 2016 NOBO thru hike. I turned 60 in August 2015 and do not want to miss this opportunity to life my dream. I do not want to look back and wish I did a thru hike, now is the time!
In terms of planning and preparation I attended Warren Doyle's Appalachian Trail Institute in April 2015. It was a learning experience with Doyle stressing that the AT is difficult and a successful hiker must adapt to the trail, i.e., the AT is the AT and it will not change, I have to change and adapt to be successful.
My preparation hikes included; Carvers Gap TN to Damascus VA., Bland VA to Pearisburg VA, Dragons Tooth to Daleville Va and numerous overnight and day hikes in and around Roanoke Va. Great opportunity to test myself on various terrain, distances, along with weather variations, including snow. Also several lessons learned regarding gear. I changed my sleeping pad to a Thermarest Evo Lite and my cook system to MSR Pocket Rocket. Very happy with Big Agnes UL Fly Creek 2 and Osprey Atmos 65 AG pack. On all hikes I was able to keep pack weight including food and water under 30 lbs.
In addition to regular hikes I maintain a regular cardio and weight training regimen at my local YMCA, taking full advantage of an Incline Treadmill, which allows me to adjust it to a 30 degree incline. I believe this has helped with uphill sections and is a big contributor to me losing 20 lbs since August. I feel great and my knees notice the difference.
My current plan is to commence my NOBO from Springer Mountain on March 23, 2016. I registered with the ATC for this date. However, I am considering moving my departure date to the March 7 - 11 time frame.
I plan to continue preparation hikes with the Roanoke ATC and maintain my YMCA workouts.

I hiked 1 mile from my home with a pack to the trail head. It was a difficult hike with mud and snow covering much of the trail.

We began with a significant ascent up a blue blaze trail to Sarver Hollow Shelter, just off the AT. Always good to get a climb done first. Once we reached the Shelter we walked the AT on a ridge line and encountered snow drifts of 3 -4 feet in areas with a cold mist. Once again, I waited too long to put gloves or mittens on and once again experienced cold fingers. I purchased a pair of waterproof gloves, along with liners and also will carry mittens.

It rained about 3 AM and I was dry except for a little water in the corner of my tent, probably based on my tent placement. However, we had to get up this morning in the rain which meant my tent got wet, which adds weight. It was good experience to take down tent and pack up in the rain, but it tests your mental fortitude. Once we got going it was actually enjoyable hiking in a light rain. It rained until approximately 10 AM.Utilized my Marmot Precip Jacket which performed well. It repelled rain, but also has good ventilation. Today would best be described in three words, i.e., Rain, Rocks and Roots. The trail had several sections that were very rocky and root covered, which coupled with the rain made it very slippery. You must focus each step and use your trekking poles for balance and stability. Hiked with same group, i.e., Steve the Hiker from Cleveland, Volunteer Dave from Houston TX and DC from Detroit MI. Great group of hiking partners. Our reward after 8 miles was a shuttle into Helen, GA. As we waited for shuttle every hiker was attempting to dry their tents, sleeping bags and clothing by standing in the parking lot letting the wind dry it. It must have been quite a sight for motorist driving past. We are sharing a room at a Best Western and will shower and do laundry. Also have restaurant food and cold beer, i.e., the simple pleasures. Helen, GA is a nice town with a German theme, i.e., all buildings have the Bavarian look. It reminded me of Frankenmuth MI. Met four 20 year olds at our campsite last night from Maine, North Carolina, Florida and Missouri. Nice group who were smoking ""left handed cigarettes"". They offered us but we declined. There are two distinct age groups on the trail, i.e., 20 and 60 year olds. Volunteer Dave showed his skills at hanging our food bags by using PCT method. You must hang your food bags to avoid bears from entering your camp or tent after they smell food. Tomorrow we will be shuttled back to Unicol Gap and hike over Tray Mountain with the plan to tent at Sassafras Gap or Deep Gap Shelter.

I included in photos section pictures of the trail today, i.e., some sections with many tree roots. I try to land each step on a level/flat surface, but sections with roots make it extremely difficult. You feel like you are ""dancing"" in order to avoid stepping on a root and attempting to land on flat surface. My new shoes help and little toe on left foot is healing. Everyone in the group is dealing with some level of discomfort, i.e., blisters, knees, ankles, etc. Remember the average age of this group! We are pleased with our pace!Our group has added another hiker ""Alabama Guy"" from Montgomery AL. He is 61, so average age of our group will be close to 60. Great group to hike with!

Random Thoughts;
Soak feet in Epsom Salts at every opportunity, it helps
Many hikers switch from hiking boots to lightweight trail runners, primarily from a weight, comfort and drying out capabilities.

Met the legendary ""Baltimore Jack"". He is a 9 time AT thru hikers and manages the Budget Inn Hostel in Franklin NC. What a wealth of information, seek him out!

I met a young man from South Carolina (Moose), he is 16 years old and is thru hiking the AT. This young man is getting a tremendous education on the AT. He is polite, well mannered and a very good hiker. His dad drove from South Carolina last night to have dinner with his son. Also met Sparky from Washington state and Hong Kong Steve from Hong Kong.

Laurel Falls is a beautiful waterfall that would be an excellent spot to swim in warmer weather. AT snakes it way around Laurel Creek in some places the rock walk is extremely narrow, must take your time. After a fairly easy trail the AT ascends Pond Flat Mountain and descends to Watauga Lake. Watauga is a Cherokee word meaning water and is a TVA dam built in the mid 40's. We spent most of the day working around or within sight of Watauga Lake. As I walked by the Watauga Lake Shelter we met a US Forest Service Ranger who was posting a notice of recent bear activity at this shelter, more on this incident later.

The person sleeping next to me at the shelter set up a mouse trap near the shelter entrance. The next morning the mouse trap was gone, either it was a very big mouse or someone picked it up, not sure, but made an interesting discussion in the morning. Mice are prevalent at the shelters looking for food. Mid morning I met Alex Best (Sunny Side) at Iron Mountain Shelter. I attended the Appalachian Trail Institute with Alex in April 2015. Alex told me he was at the Watauga Lake Shelter the night before and witnessed three (3) bear entering tents and shaking the bear pole to get food. In fact Alex had his food bag on the bear pole, which is approximately 20 feet off the ground with hooks that you attach your food bag. He said the bear stood on its hind legs and shook the pole hard enough to release his food bag. Alex lost approximately 75% of his food and all of this candy. Three other hikes had their tents damaged by the bears. No one was hurt, but Alex was shaken by the event. This shelter was closed for approximately 2 years because of bear activity. It is fairly close to a road and people bring food and leave it, the bears have become accustomed to food at this location. Unfortunately, the US Forest Service Ranger indicated the shelter may be closed again. Also met three (3) trail maintainers from the Tennessee Eastman AT Club who were performing trail work. I thanked them for their service. These volunteers are invaluable to the AT. As I approached TN 91 treated to trail magic courtesy of the Nelson County Baptist Church 4 & 5 grades. They had pop, homemade snacks, hygiene items, etc, in a large orange bear proof metal container. It seems trail magic always comes at the perfect time. For me this day it was 12 noon and I was ready for a break. After lunch I walked for approximately 1 mile on a section of the AT that is wheelchair accessible. It rolls through a pasture with level surface. Weather was again warm and sunny in
the afternoon, i.e., hot hiking. Compared to most days the trail today was level with no significant climbs or descents, which was the reason I choose to hike almost 23 miles. I made it to Abington Gap Shelter at 6:20 PM, after a long day.

We shared a table with two NASCAR TV employees who shared many interesting insights about teams and drivers, very interesting discussion. Dinner was at 128 Pecan.

The day began with fog/mist lingering from evening showers, which obstructed view from Kelly Knob after an early climb. The skies cleared and I encountered several stream crossings in which the only option was to wade across, which meant wet shoes. Current was too rapid to risk stepping on rocks to avoid wet feet. Fortunately, my trail runner shoes dry very quickly. Beautiful pastures were next up, which I thoroughly enjoy walking through (see pictures), they are peaceful and usually have a level even walking surface. The pastures led to the Keifer Oak, an 18 foot around tree that is over 300 years old (see pictures). A climb led to a long rocky ridge line mid afternoon walk with many slanted rocks to traverse. The sun was out and temperatures rising. This is when it got interesting. As I was traversing rocks I heard a sound to my right. I did not recognize it immediately, but quickly realized it was a rattle. I froze and then stepped back and quickly looked around moved and spotted what I believe was a timber rattlesnake to my right just off the trail. He was doing his job by warning me with his rattle. I took a couple of pictures and estimate it was 3-4 feet long and wide. He was not coiled, but continued to rattle and slowly moved away into some bushes. Needless, to say this was my first encounter with a rattlesnake and spooked me. I spent the rest of the hike scanning the trail for more rattlesnakes. This is a great example of why you should not wear headphones while hiking. If I had headphones in I would not have heard the rattle and may have walked into the snake, big lesson learned. Soon after this happened the skies opened up with a large thunderstorm with lighting. I donned my pack cover and rain jacket and increased my pace. As I reached my destination I checked my pockets and pack for my car key, which I could not locate. I dropped my car off in the morning was shuttled forward by Evan Lukow and hiked back to it. Forrest arrived soon after I did and was also wet from the thunderstorm. To make matters worse I did not have cell service and could not contact Evan or Jill. I walked up the road and flagged down a passing car. They lived in the area and let me use their phone which had US Cellular service.

I use a small non battery powered toothbrush on the trail and brush twice a day. It must be working out as my teeth cleaning appointment went well, i.e., little build up and not bleeding gums - Yea! I also visited my Mom who is 95 and gave her an early Mother's Day card and flowers, I will be on the AT on Mother's Day. She recognized me today an we had a nice visit. She asks me many questions about my hike. Also took the opportunity to spray my tent, pack and all clothing with Permetherin. Permetherin is applied to your gear to minimize impact of Ticks. They tend to void items treated with it. I am heading into Tick season and country and frankly getting a Tick related illness, i.e., Lyme Disease is a concern. Hope this helps! Obtained necessary resupplies and relaxed at home. It rained all day, so a zero worked out well.

I left at 7:30 am and reached goal at 8:58 am, 3.9 miles in 1 1/2 hours, pretty quick for me. Today's hike felt like a ""home court advantage"" for me in that I have hiked all or part of the route at least ten times over the last several years.

They are spending tonight at the Beeson house and Aubrey will shuttle us all back to Bearwallow Gap tomorrow morning.
Today's hike leaves Daleville and slowly climbs up to the Blue Ridge Parkway, which it parallels, it is a route I have previously hiked, not overly difficult and lends itself to a 20+ mile day with slack packs. We met Virginia Creeper and Kiwi, another mother/daughter team from Blacksburg VA. Also met GO, from Georgia. Saw entries in Wilson Creek Shelter journal from Moose and Forrest, who are one day ahead of me. My daughter, Aubrey met us on the trail with about 3 1/2 miles to go and hiked with us to Bearwallow Gap. It was very enjoyable to hike with Aubrey. I believe she enjoyed the peace and tranquility of the trail.
The Blue Ridge Parkway was closed from mile mark 105 to 90 for resurfacing activity. This meant no cars or motorcycles were present at any of the overlook areas, we had them to ourselves. It also meant we hiked a little longer to get to VA 43 for pickup. It was a wonderful weather day to hike, i.e., low 60's with nice breeze.

It is an AT tradition to eat a half gallon of ice cream at this store after passing half way point. I selected a half gallon of Cookies & Cream and received the wooden spoon to signify completion. In the interest of full disclosure, I shared a good portion of my ice cream with a fellow hiker. At 9 am in the morning there was no way I could eat a half gallon of ice cream, but I wanted to participate in the tradition. Also visited the AT Museum located next to the general store. It has a good collection of AT memorabilia and information, well worth a visit. We spent nearly 2 hours at the general store and museum, longer than our normal break, but throughly enjoyed the time spent.
Surprised at general store to meet ""Iceman"", he is an AT hiker from Lancaster PA, who has been following Forrest and my journals. He knew we would be in the area and offered to let us slack pack to our next destination, we gladly accepted his offer. Iceman helped Moose with a ride several days ago and Moose provided our name to him. Slack packing helped us do extra miles on another humid day. Iceman also met us half way through our hike today and provided soft drinks, in addition he met us at end of hike and drove us to Motel. We offered to buy him dinner. but he declined. Another example of the great group of individuals associated with the AT, i.e., will go out of their to help a hiker. Iceman is a true AT Trail Angel, thanks again for your assistance. Trail today was easy and relatively flat, with the exception of last mile, with a steep climb combined with significant rock/boulder scrambling (see pictures). Felt good today in spite of high humidity, getting my hiking legs back with full pack.","Toms Run Shelter

Hiking buddy ""Mountain Dew"" from Roanoke VA called and is section hiking with us. He drove up from Roanoke last night. Great to see him and hike. He was a great help to me last summer and fall when we did several AT prep hikes. I always picked up valuable information from him. His friend, Jo dropped us off and picked us up at trailhead. Today was the easiest trail I have walked so far, i.e., level smooth trail with no climbs. Most of the trail was in the Cumberland Valley, a prominent farming area in Pennsylvania and involved walking through other beside farm fields. Humidity remained high with sunny skies as a result consumed ample quantities of water.  Walked through town of Boiling Springs PA where we ate lunch at ATC regional offices overlooking a lake, nice setting. We crossed three major highways today. i.e., Pennsylvania Turnpike, PA 11 and I -81 at each crossing bridge we reverted to childhood behavior and pumped our arm up and down to encourage truckers to blow their. It works, we got some horns honking at each highway. Met Court Jester, young hiker from New Hampshire who had a tick on him. I gave him my plastic Ticked Off device and it worked like a charm to remove the tick. Big Thumbs Up to Holly Inn in Mt Holly Springs PA, hiker friendly with clean rooms, reasonable rates, walking distance to downtown stores, on site restaurant/bar and pick up and delivery to AT trailhead, highly recommend.","Whiskey Spring Road

Hiking today was difficult. Humidity was again high with temperatures in the upper 80's. I did not have my usual energy, felt lethargic. Trail started with farm field/meadow walking as we completed Cumberland Valley portion. We then transitioned to ridgeline walking into Duncannon PA along a 6 mile rocky section. The infamous Pennsylvania rocks begin, especially as you descend into trail town of Duncannon PA. AT goes directly through town. We are spending the night at AT hiker famous Doyle Hotel. The building was built in 1905 by  Augustus Busch, who had many hotels around the country.  They rent rooms only to AT hikers, but have a bar and restaurant for the public. Received great trail magic this evening from Christ Lutheran Church who provided a spaghetti dinner with fruit and lettuce salad for AT thru hikers.  I had a small portion of spaghetti, but loaded up on fruit and lettuce salad, both items I do not get on the trail.

Enjoyed nice breakfast at Goodies directly across the street from the Doyle Hotel. Cooler temperatures today, but humidity remains high. I am making a conscious effort to drink more water to avoid dehydration impact. AT winds it's way through the town of Duncannon for almost 2 miles. We walked by many homes with folks sitting on the front porch and kids getting ready for school. The kids seemed especially happy I bet the end of the school year is near.  You got a chance to see and experience Duncannon. Unfortunately, it has the feel of many old industrial towns. i.e., the best days are in the past. The last several days we have not seen many  north bound thru hikers. Met one south bound today, i.e., Retainer. After crossing the  Susquehanna River, we climbed up to a ridgeline and spent the balance of the day walking the ridgeline with moderate rocks. I know the difficult Pennsylvania rocks are ahead. Met Tin Man last night at Christ Lutheran Church hiker dinner. He is a 2011 thru hiker and agreed to pick us up at trailhead tonight and return us Friday morning, allowing us to spend one additional night at Doyle Hotel.

We slept later this morning for extra rest and did not get on the trail until 1 pm. Tin Man picked us up at the Doyle and took us to PA 325.  Full packs today, no more slack packing in the foreseeable future. Duncannon and Susquehanna River area has significant population of peregrine falcons, interesting to watch them slowly soar overhead. In fact, there is a warning on the Susquehanna Bridge to hikers that falcons may dive at you as you cross the bridge. Light rain early, turning to spotty sunshine with continued high humidity. Heard gunfire for several hours this afternoon, rapid first 3 bursts. There must be a shooting range in close proximity. After a 1000 climb trail was ridgeline walking again, with moderate rocks and relatively easy. I continue to wrestle with the mental aspects of a thru hike, loneliness/homesick/missing loved ones. I try to focus on the reason I wanted to do a thru hike, i.e., personal and reinforce to myself that I am more than half way. I have read Appalachian Trails by Zach Davis twice, which focuses on the mental aspects. I have worked myself into excellent hiking shape and am confident I can handle the physical aspects of walking 15 - 20 miles each day with a pack. Forrest is a great hiking companion and it helps me to have a hiking partner. We saw one north bound thru hiker today and are the only ones tenting near a stream tonight.","PA 325

As a result we left 501 Shelter around 8 am with intention to hike to PA 138 about 10 miles and stay at a new hostel, Rock 'n Sole Hostel to miss severe weather.  It is not in AWOL's 2016 guide yet. New Dave tipped me off with a text message that hostel existed.  We decided to take a chance. I called this morning and secured two spots.  Craig met us at PA 138 trailhead. Craig is a retired Pennsylvania State Trooper who opened his hostel in March. It is located in a detached building from his home. Includes 6 bunks, hot shower, breakfast and dinner for $35. Great host and outstanding hiker Hostel. It rained on us most of the morning, not heavy but constant. Trail again contained sections that looked like a fern carpet.

Beautiful blue skies, lower humidity and temperatures in the 70's greeted us today,  i.e., great hiking weather. A welcome relief. I was reminded when looking at today's date that 72 years ago this morning the D-day invasion commenced. What a brave group that took on the challenge of a beach landing into hostile territory. Many made the ultimate sacrifice and should never be forgotten. Unfortunately, that generation and their stories are being lost to time. Trail alternated between flat surface to rocks, intensity of rocks is picking up. Mountain Laurel were in bloom on several sections, along with ferns. I was told the ferns are plentiful because deer do not eat them. We need some of those in our yard. Hiked with Snowball, from Hamburg, Germany - Bond, from Massachusetts - Juice from Chicago and Forrest. Great hiking group. Snowball has been hiking 3 weeks and must return to Germany. She is sad to leave the AT and return to work. The trail routed us through Port Clinton, PA, an old coal transportation town, that has seen its best days.

I woke up a 4 am and was cold, pulled on my silk liner and quilt. Great sleeping weather! Got an early start at 7 am and spent most of the morning walking on and over rocks (see pictures). Made it to Allentown Shelter minutes before thunderstorm began. Sat out the storm with three other hikers until about 1 pm. We actually all took naps. Temperatures dropped into the high 40's, but no rain the rest of the day. It was the first day in a long time that I hiked all day in long sleeves. Trail alternated between level surface and rocks with significant boulder climbing and scrambling. The boulder scrambling is difficult and nerve wracking, because a misstep could easily result in a fall or broken ankle.  One section was called the Knifes Edge, the name is appropriate.  These sections require you to slow down and take your time. In spite of 3 hour break for weather we were able to 15 miles and made it to Bake Oven Shelter, where we are tenting.

Today marked 3 months on the AT! In some ways it seems the time has gone by quickly and in other ways it has not. However, my goal is in sight - Onward and Upward. Another cool evening with temperatures in the 40's. I love those temperatures for sleeping. On the trail by 7 AM with boulder scrambling and rocks to begin and then sections of level terrain. Forrest and I arrived at intersection for Palmerton and Walnutport PA around 11:30 am. We looked at our guide book and noticed that Walnutport had a McDonald's and Burger King and was approximately 2 miles away. At this point I got out my ""secret weapon"", i.e., a yellow bandana with HIKER TO TOWN on one side and HIKER TO TRAIL on the other. We put our thumbs out and within 2 minutes had a ride to Walnutport with Eric a local AT hiker. He dropped us off at McDonald's and said he would pick us up in 1 hour. In 1 hour he came back and took us to the trailhead. Another example of AT hikers helping each other. I had a Quarter Pounder Deluxe, Large Fries, Double Cheeseburger and Coke. It was wonderful and the calories were essential based on upcoming climb.  We faced a 1000 foot climb in a mile, i.e., steep over a rock/boulder strewn area. Probably the steepest climb we have faced so far. The climb is from the Lehigh River to the top of Palmerton Super Fund site. Just as we started the climb we spotted a cooler of Trail Magic. It contained soft drinks, Pretzels and cookies. We took a few items for our dinner.  Again, I take these types of climbs slowly because you are only one misstep from ending your hike. For years Palmerton was home to a zinc mine and smelting operation. Unfortunately, the zinc operation contaminated the surrounding area and killed most of the vegetation. The facility closed in the late 1980's and is the site of EPA Super Fund remediation. The AT skirts the old mining operation and plant life and trees are returning. However, you could still see evidence of widespread areas where all trees were dead. The rock intensity increased today, it seems lately the trail is easy and flat or rock/ boulder strewn, no middle ground. Happy to complete 17.5 miles today.","Bake Oven Shelter

From Smith's Gap to Wind Gap, a distance of 7.5 miles were the worst rocks to date. Relentless rocks, not always smooth, but small rocks with sharp points. You spend your time with your head down focused on finding that small spot to place your foot. Often you must step on the rock and your foot is always moving around, rarely do you have a flat foot placement. This wears on me, but the trail is the trail. I must grind it out and move forward. Sherrie, Forrest's friend arrived this afternoon. She will be here through Wednesday, which will allow slackpacking and increased miles. In addition, will have a room each night with bed and shower, great news! Tonight we are in Windy Gap PA. Great dinner at Cafe on Broadway in Windy Gap, very hiker friendly.

Again, you must be careful with foot placement and take your time.However, the trail from this point into Delaware Water Gap was less rocky and included several flat level areas. Big milestone today, completed Pennsylvania and entered New Jersey. Seven  (7) states complete with seven (7) remaining.  The rocks do not necessarily end as you leave Pennsylvania, but I am told not as intense going forward, let's hope so. I made a shoe change today that worked out great. I switched from my trail runners to Merrill Moeb Venilators. The Merrill's are heavier, but have a  heavier sole with a stiff insole.  They worked great and absorbed the impact of the rocks. I wish I made the shoe switch earlier. Note to AT hikers you may want to switch to heavier sole shoe no later than Duncannon PA, it will help with rock impact. I love the comfort, weight and breathability of my Brooks Cascadia trail runners, but they do not handle the rocks as well. Plan to go back to trail runners as rock impact decreases.  The trail took us through Deleware Water Gap PA.

June 20 was Summer Solstice. There is an AT tradition that you hike naked on Summer Solstice. I am happy to report that Forrest and I did not participate, nor did we see any AT hikers participating, it would not be a pretty sight.
Felt stronger today with temperatures and humidity lower. Started day with hot dog and egg sandwich from Trail Angel Joe. He was up at 5 am and had coffee ready for Forrest. Trail had NY typical ups and downs, but overall not as difficult. Passed over Shenandoah Mountain early in the day, which has a US flag painted on rocks as 9/11 Memorial. Enjoyed outstanding Pastrami on rye sandwich at Mountaintop Delight near Stormville NY. Met Farmer and Cinderella with her dog Pickler. I had not seen Cinderella since Virginia. Also met Black Santa. He has not taken a shower or washed clothes for over 10 days. He is headed to NYC to see a friend. I could not and will not go 10 days without a shower. Forrest and I attempt to reach a motel or hostel every 3/4 days, we like to stay clean. Passed a huge oak tree in the afternoon (see pictures), estimate age at 250 years plus.","Clarence Fahnestock State Park

I fall back on my goal to complete this journey and support from family and friends as motivation to keep going. I take one day at a time and break each day down into segments and push on. In the morning walked by Nuclear Lake,site of a plutonium facility that was closed by a chemical explosion in the 70's. Area has been monitored and AT is routed around the lake. Needless to say drinking the water is not recommended. Spent time walking with a local day hiker who had many questions about thru hiking. He is considering an AT hike. This helped me work through morning sluggishness and was a big help to me. Passed the Dover Oak, which is oldest and largest Oak tree on AT at over 300 years old and 6 feet in diameter. Enjoyed a cold drink and water break at Native Landscapes, which is located on the AT and is hiker friendly. A local food truck was set up in a nearby parking area and enjoyed a large burger and Cole slaw for lunch. I felt much better after lunch, maybe I was just hungry. Afternoon involved easy trail with section of open pasture. Surprised with Trail magic at CT 55 courtesy of Croc n Roll's parents, cold drinks, water and chips. Big Thank You. But Trail Magic did not end. Rick, a friend of Forrest drove up from Newark NJ and took us out to dinner and to grocery. What a treat and greatly appreciated.

On the trail at 6:45 am and faced a steep descent down stone steps on St. John's Ledge, must take your time to avoid a fall. It would be treacherous, if wet. The next 4 miles was an easy walk along flat terrain along the Housatonic River. The sound of moving water was a great way to start the day.However, immediately after the river walk ended the trail resumed it's up and down pattern with several step climbs,all under temperatures in the upper 80's. I again, drank considerable and felt sluggish before lunch and mid afternoon. Not sure I am eating enough. Met Bob and Kathy a couple from Long Island that were day hiking. They took our picture and had questions about thru hiking. Lunch was near Housatonic State Park, where we met two families day hiking who also had many thru hiking questions. They also took our trash, which was a big help. As mentioned the day was hot and terrain difficult. I was sluggish mid afternoon and as always seems to happen, when I am down something positive happens. In this case a day hiker passed us near West Cornwell Road and told us he left a cooler just past the road. Oh my gosh this was what I needed. Our pace increased and the cooler had ice cold Gatorade, Coke and Mountain Dew. The Gatorade was wonderful and boosted me for the next 3.7 miles to our camping spot. This section included a tight rock squeeze similar to the Lemon Sqeezer in New York (see pictures). With the weight I have lost I made it through with no problem. As I was drinking the Gatorade, Champa came up. He is a young ex marine I first meet in Georgia and had not seen since Tennessee. We caught up on different hikers, great to see him again.

It was an armed uprising led by Daniel Shay's, a Revolutionary War veteran protesing taxes paid by farmers. It was forcibly put down by US government.We noticed a sign along the Housatonic River warning against eating fish because of PCB contamination.

Crossed many streams that were flowing swiftly.  Received Trail Magic of a Budweiser and chocolate chip cookies from the mother of two young men hiking the Long Trail. Nice young guys, but carrying too much gear and tend to spread their items all over the shelters, they will learn.   The afternoon turned into literally walking up stream. The trail was full of water rushing downhill and at one point I took a step and water was almost to my knee. Passed through a thick pine forest that reminded me of Gnome country, it included several rock gardens with rock cairn displays.

Objective was to have lunch at Qu Whistle Stop restaurant, which was .5 miles off trail on VT 103. We heard favorable comments from other hikers.  On the steep descent into Clarendon Gorge, just before VT 103 I fell on a slippery rock and initially thought I had serious damage to my left knee. The knee twisted at an odd angle when I fell. We say we are only one misstep away from going home and for a moment I thought this was my misstep. After gaining my composure I was able to get up and continue hiking. I have new hiking poles on the way from REI. I definitely need two poles. However, until Friday I have only one pole. As we crossed suspension bridge at Clarendon Gorge I saw a man panning for gold in the Mill River. Breakfast at Qu Whistle Stop was excellent, pancakes, eggs, sausage and toast.

Forrest and I deferred and watched the younger hikers take the 50 foot leap off the bridge. Everyone came through unscathed. Next stop was Nazy's, a cafe in town. Forrest, Tortilla, Hawk and Lookout all got Deep Fried Tacos. I was full and hiked on. Today's hike was fairly easy with good trail and no big climbs. We did encounter a sign warning of ground bees. I avoided a sting, but Forrest and Two Socks were both stung. Two Socks and Trooper are an interesting story. Two Socks got his trail name because he has worn the same two socks the entire hike with no washing. Trooper is from Scotland. They met on the trail and were ""married"" in Damascus VA by Spike. Spike from Germany received his ordained minister designation on line and performed the ""ceremony"". Just as Forrest and I arrived at the edge of Norwich a van pulled up beside us and asked if we were Forrest and Hooshr? The driver identified herself as ""The Hat Lady"" and indicated she was following our journals. She had Snickers for us. Amazing show of Trail magic as we entered Norwich, Vermont. The AT involves a 1 mile road walk into Norwich. It is always enjoyable to see a town close up. Norwich appears to be a well to do town with New England charm. Great job to Trail Boss, Sherri for making lodging arrangements at Norwich Inn. It is too nice for the two sweaty and smelly hikers. We cleaned up and enjoyed a beer on their front porch. Next door is Dan & Whits, a general store that offers day old sandwiches to AT hikers. I got what is probably the best Reuben Sandwich I have ever had at no cost. Washed clothes and relaxed balance of the day. Three packages were waiting for me at Norwich Inn. Cool weather sleeping bag, clothes and food items from Jill. New shoes from Merrell. Merrell will replace shoes for AT hikers who wear them out on AT, at no cost. Big thumbs up to Merrell for outstanding customer service. These shoes will take me the rest of the way. New Black Diamond hiking poles from REI. I hiked the week with only one pole and am very happy to have two again. Plan to take a Zero on Saturday and get everything ready for push into New Hampshire and Maine.","Thistle Hill Shelter

Zero day in Norwich VT and Hanover New Hampshire. Big thumbs up to Norwich Inn. Hiker rate is considerably lower than normal rate. Nicest place we have stayed on AT. Surprised they let us check in yesterday the way we looked and smelled. AT supporters in Hanover New Hampshire put together a list of individuals who will host hikers and/or provide shuttles, i.e., Trail Angel's. We called Marilyn from the list and she picked us up from the Norwich Inn at 10 am and took us to; outfitter. grocery store, optical store and AT&T store. What a great service and a huge assist to us to get all errands and resupply accomplished! Relaxed and arranged pack the balance of the day. Dan & Whit's is a General Store next to the Norwich Inn. It is a community institution and caters to AT hikers. In fact, they give AT hikers free day old sandwiches. As we enter New Hampshire the difficulty of hiking increases. I have heard the expression that while we have 20% of AT left it will require 80% of total hike effort. Many hikers before me have completed this next section and I am determined and confident I can do the same. Tomorrow we move forward!","Main Street Norwich Vermont

Road walk out of Norwich VT across the Connecticut River and I entered New Hampshire. Twelve states complete with two remaining. AT takes you through Hanover, NH, home of Dartmouth College. Very nice affluent college town with many restaurant options. We chose Lou's for breakfast, they offer free donut or muffin to hikers. I enjoyed a great breakfast sandwich and maple donut. The place was jammed, so we sat at the counter. Adjacent to us were Missy and Rich from the Baltimore area. They were visiting their son. 
Rich had roots in the Staunton VA area. We had a nice conversation with them over breakfast. AT followed through downtown Hanover and entered the woods near the football stadium. Continue to meet south bound AT thru hikers who started about 5 weeks ago from Mt. Katahdin. Enjoyed trail magic from Dennis and Marsha at 3 Mile Road and Goose Pond Road - Coke, Hot Dogs, Chips, Baked Beans and Donuts. Big Thank You!. It made a difference having two hiking poles again and new shoes. Hopefully my equipment is all set for the finish. Trail was not overly difficult today, but we called it a day around 5:30 after 15.4 miles. We are stealth camping near Goose Pond Road.

Stopped at ""The Ice Cream Man's"" house. Home of Bill Ackerly who for many years provided ice cream bars, place to camp, WiFi and power connection to AT hikers. He also was a croquet master and took on all AT hikers who dared challenge him.  Regrettably Bill passed away in May 2016. His family is working to keep the tradition alive. When we stopped no ice cream was available, but we were able to get water, use WiFi and charge phones. Big climb up Smarts Mountain, 2400 feet with several steep rocky sections. Also encountered considerable mud which required the talent of a ballerina to negotiate stone and tree limbs as stepping stones. Met Handmade on the way up Smarts Mountain who was using an axe to clear trees across the trail. He thru hiked last year and was disgusted with lack of trail maintenance. He vowed to return and perform trail maintenance on trees across the trail. He started in Lincoln, New Hampshire and has been working his way south. Today was a tough hiking day for me, i.e., considerable elevation change, steep and rocky. All conditions I will encounter going forward and preparation for what awaits us in the White Mountains.

Significant thunderstorm last night, glad I was in a shelter. We experienced the impact today as many trees were down across the trail, which requires either a walk through or around the debris. Also saw the work of ""Homemade"" in terms of trees he cleared from the trail with his axe. Commendable that he has taken it on himself to clear tree blow downs. Unfortunate the local AT Club has not done a better job performing blow down maintenance and trimming of over growth on the trail. My local AT Club, Roanoke VA AT does an excellent job maintaining their 113 miles of the trail. I do not always see this level of diligence on other sections of the AT. Significant steep rocky climb up Mt. Cube to start the day and then an easier last 10 miles to NH 25 and Hikers Welcome Hostel. As we descended Mt. Cube we met a southbound hiker by the name of Wrong way. We first met Wrong way on May 25 as we left Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. He thru hiked in 2015 and rode his bike from New Mexico via the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. He was headed to Mt. Katahdin to begin a southbound thru hike. Little did we know we would meet again on the AT, quite a coincidence. Continue to meet more southbound thru hikers all left approximately 5 weeks ago. Tomorrow we begin hiking the Whites with Mt.

Taking advantage of opportunity offered by Hikers Welcome Hostel to slack pack Mt. Moosilauke. This is our first 4000+ Mountain in New Hampshire and is just before we enter White Mountain National Forest. Steep rocky climb along a waterfall for the first 1 1/2 miles  followed by walk thru high pine forest to the open area at the summit of Mt. Moosilauke. The smell of ""Pine Sol"" was in the air. Once I reached the summit the temperature dropped and the wind picked up considerably. In fact, I put on my puffy jacket and beanie.  View was a 360° with a great look at the upcoming White Mountains, including Mt. Washington. Took several photos and hunkered down behind a rock wall to eat our lunch. On the way down we encountered our first Moose (see pictures). It seemed to be guarding the trail and required a slow walk to get around it. I am told it is unusual to see a moose at high elevation. With a big climb comes a big descent and this was no exception. Completed hike around 3:30 pm and felt good to have Mt. Moosilauke complete. Spending the night at Hikers Welcome Hostel. We will be shuttled back to Kinsman Notch tomorrow morning and head north","NH 25

Today was the most difficult hiking day I can remember. Instead of normal pace of approximately 2 miles per hour I averaged around 1 mile per hour. I had thoughts during the day that if everyday in the Whites is like this I am not sure I can make it. I spoke to several hikers who have previously hiked this section. They indicated it was an especially difficult section and is not indicative of what I will face. This helped my outlook. Several steep rocky climbs, highlighted by 1000 foot climb up South Kinsman Mountain in 1 mile. The views at the top were spectacular and this usually makes you forget the difficulty of the climb. Trail was up and down, root covered and muddy. I could never get into a hiking rhythm. What I have to guard against is getting ""angry"" at the trail. It is what it is and I must adapt to it. Needless to say the Whites will be a challenge and my pace slower. I need to take my time and enjoy the spectacular scenery/views. Today was a great example of the value of a hiking partner. If I was hiking alone I would have probably stopped at the Ezra Brooks Shelter at 3:30 pm and called it a day, I was spent. Forrest wanted to hike on and it was the right decision. It helped that the next 1 mile was along Eliza Brook, which was beautiful and calming. As a result we hiked another 4 miles to Kinsman Pond Shelter, which was the right decision. The conventional wisdom is that your pace in the Whites slows and you are happy with 8 - 10 miles/day.","Kinsman Notch

When I arrived at Kinsman Pond Shelter last night it was full of trail maintenance volunteers from the Appalachian Mountain Club. This is the club that maintains the trail in the Whites. All the volunteers were women and they reluctantly made space for a sweaty male thru hiker. I was very tired from a tough day hiking. All I wanted to do was set up my sleeping pad, sleeping quilt, eat something and go to sleep. The shelter was adjacent to a pond, which allowed me to wash my legs and face off. I was the first one to go to sleep, but was awaken by the loudest snoring I have heard from a female in a shelter. Her trail name should be ""Freight Train"". I fumbled around and located my ear plugs, which did the job and allowed me to sleep. I was up early and Forrest and I left by 6:30 am. Forrest tented and avoided the snoring in shelter. Trail was steep and rocky leaving the shelter, but improved after 2 miles as we reached Lonesome Lake Hut. Huts in the Whites are operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club  (AMC). They are very popular with families doing day or section hikes. The rate is $120/night, which is high for AT thru hikers. They do provide leftovers to AT hikers. We were given all the oatmeal we could eat. They also provide soup for $2, all you can eat. I plan to take advantage of this. Short hike to Franconia  Notch and resupply in Lincoln, New Hampshire. We are staying at Autumn Breeze Motel in Woodstock, NH. Very hiker friendly, picked us up at trailhead, did our laundry, shuttled to resupply and had cold drinks and beer in fridge for us.

Enjoyed lunch on top of Mt. Lafayette. This section of Franconia Ridge is very popular for day hikers and given it was a Saturday the trail was crowded. It felt like we were at Disney World at times with kids running the trails and darting in and out. Around 1 pm everything changed, a thunderstorm rolled in and everyone scattered. Franconia Ridge is above tree line and not a place you want to be in a thunderstorm. We moved as quickly as we could to get below treeline, but frankly I was worried about lighting strikes. It rained on and off with several claps of thunder and lighting as we made the 4 mile hike to Garfield Ridge Shelter. Arrived at the shelter wet, but unscathed.","Franconia Notch

No rain today with blue skies and temperatures in the 70's. Hiked 2.7 miles to Galehead Hut and bowel of oatmeal, provided at no cost to AT thru hikers. I loaded it up with brown sugar and cream cheese frosting. Not necessarily an oatmeal fan, but it tastes great for a hiker. After the hut we faced an extremely rocky steep climb up South Twin Mountain. Climb was 900 feet in .8 miles to an elevation of 4902 feet with excellent views.  Hiking today was difficult, which requires me to dig deep mentally.  The Whites are testing me physically and mentally.  We hiked 9.6 miles today and ended the day at Zealand Falls Hut, which is located next to a waterfall. Frankly, I am spent as we arrived at the Hut. We are staying at the hut under a work for stay arrangement, which means we get a dinner, place to sleep in exchange for 2 hours helping with chores. The Hut guests are paying $120/night for bunkhouse and meals. My dinner was quinoa, curry chicken, lasagna, mushroom soup and garlic bread. I had two helpings, which tasted great. I definitely need the calories. My chores were to wash cups and glasses, it took me approximately 30 minutes. Other thru hikers arrived later and were given our leftovers.

Started climb up to the ""Presidential"" range, although all peaks are not named after presidents. Once again the pine smell is strong and invigorating, best described as an open bottle of Pine Sol. I felt really good this morning. I attribute it to the dinner and breakfast I had at AMC Highland Center. We stayed in their bunkhouse, which included dinner and breakfast. Dinner was a buffet and I loaded up on pork loin, chicken fingers, rice, broccoli, salad, bread and cheesecake, multiple helpings. Needless to say I got my monies worth. Breakfast was scrambled eggs, bacon, cereal, home fries and orange juice. I had multiple helpings of bacon. Our bunkmates gave us a ride to trailhead from AMC Highland Center, Trail magic. Today was a climbing day, i.e., 1277 feet to 5095, including Mt. Webster, Mt. Jackson, Mt.Pierce and Mt. Franklin. Stopped at Mizpah Springs Hut at noon and enjoyed soup provided To AT thru hikers for $2. After lunch it was series of small climbs, but all were above tree line. Above tree line you are exposed to weather changes and I experienced it today. Weather changed from sunny to foggy with winds gusts 30 + and light misting rain, which required rain jacket. Our objective was Lake of Clouds Hut, which we reached around 4 pm. We were able to secure work for stay. Our work involved taking an inventory of freezer and organizing items. Forrest and I did an outstanding job. We will get a meal and place to stay. We are 1.5 miles from summit of Mt. Washington and will reach it tomorrow morning.

What a difference a day makes, clear sky, with no fog or cloud obstructions, but temperatures in the 80's most of the day. Started with 1.5 mile hike to Mt. Washington, which is the second highest point on the AT at 6288 feet. Outstanding views from the summit. I got a surprise visit from Chris List. Chris was an Appalachian Trail Institute participant and has closely followed my hike. He also met us in Hot Springs, NC. Great to see Chris, we may get together on Thursday in Gorham NH. After leaving Mt. Washington the AT parallels the Cog Railroad, which we watched bring visitors to Mt. Washington. It reminded me of the little engine that could as it chugged up the mountain. The AT follows a ridgeline after Mt. Washington and crossed or skirted the following mountains; Mt. Clay, Mt. Jefferson and Mt. Madison. The trail is rocky and involves considerable up and down. It is above tree line for approximate 6 miles, so having good weather is critical. It also meant we were in the sun most of the day, got a little sunburned on neck. Stopped for a break at Madison Hut and eat our lunch along with bowel of free oatmeal. Leaving we had a steep 500 foot boulder climb over 1/2 mile, followed by steep descent over rocks/boulders for 3 miles until we reached Osgood Tent Site. My knees were ""screaming"" at me during this descent. Passed a couple of hikers who were stopped to take ""Vitamin I"", hiker jargon for ibuprofen. Happy to reach Osgood Tent Site, set up tent. I ate dinner and went to bed quickly, long tough last half of the day. Tomorrow our plan is to reach Pinkham Notch, 5 miles and stay at White Mountain Lodge and Hostel, resupply and get rest before we finish the last 21 miles of the White Mountains.","Lakes of Clouds Hut

Short hike into Pinkham Notch this morning with plans to stay at White Mountain Lodge and Hostel in Gorham. Will rest and resupply. The white blaze trail marking system in the White Mountains is not always utilized. In some cases you rely upon rock cairns to identify the trail. Leaving the campsite this morning neither Forrest or I read our guidebook closely and we missed a key cutoff trail. As a result, we hiked probably an extra hour, lesson learned. There is a section of the AT in which no white blazes are used. We hiked this section today. For the life of me I do not know why or the rationale. The white blaze system has worked for over 1800 miles and someone smarter than me from the Appalachian Mountain Club decided not to use blazes. I have heard several comments from other hikers frustrated with lack of or confusing signage in the section of AT maintained by the Appalachian Mountain Club  (AMC), enough venting.  Rested and cleaned up items this afternoon. Met Chris List for dinner and a resupply trip to Walmart. Thank you Chris! Plan is to complete the final 21 miles of the White Mountains over the next two days.","Osgood Tent Site

Another Pine Sol day with hiking in high pine areas. Stayed at White Mountain Lodge and Hostel last night. Good hostel, recommend for AT hikers. They shuttled us to trailhead and we got started hiking a little after 8 am, which is late for us. Day started with climb up Wildcat Mountain Peaks A,C,D & E, an elevation change of 2200 feet to 4422 feet. Wildcat is a large ski resort and peak D was the top of their gondola system. As has been typical the climb was rocky and steep. Just as we reached peak D it started to drizzle, but fortunately did not last long. The balance of day was sunny and warm. Reached Carter Notch Hut around 12:30 pm and stopped for lunch. Carter Notch Hut is the final hut for northbound hikers. Enjoyed a bowl of Moroccan Lentil soup and bread. This was the best soup of any of the huts. Big 500 foot climb out of hut to Carter Dome and Mt. Hight, which provided great views of Presidential Range. After a long day Forrest and started to look for tent sites and located a site near North Carter Mountain. It was not ideal, but worked.

Moriah early with outstanding views back to the Presidential Range, i.e., Mt. Washington, Mt. Jefferson, Mt. Adams and Mt. Madison. It was a clear day and we could see auto road up Mt. Washington and various towers on top. Which are usually obscured by clouds. This was followed by long rocky descent to the Rattle River. After the Rattle Rivet the trail was nicely graded and gently sloping downward, probably the easiest trail we have walked in the Whites.This allowed us to pick up our pace and reach US 2 Gorham by 1:00 pm. Unfortunately, the White Mountain Lodge and Hostel was full, but Marnie the owner drove us into Gorham. We secured a room at Northern Peaks Motor Inn. My Merrill shoes that I received from Merrill in Norwich VT started to rip on one side and the tread was peeling. The Whites with the rock/boulder scrambling is tough on shoes. They lasted less than 200 miles. I was able to visit an outfitter in Gorham and secure what I hope will be my final pair of shoes. Met Chris List again in Gorham and he took me to Walmart for a couple of resupply items. Finished day with large dinner of Spaghetti and Meatballs at Mr.Pizza. With our arrival in Gorham we have finished the AT portion of White Mountains. This was tough/difficult hiking, but I feel a sense of accomplishment to finish. The scenery and views were amazing.

Shelter was full last and did not sleep particularly well.  Up at 5:30 and getting ready for big day making our way through boulder field at Mahoosuc Notch, which is known as the most fun or most difficult mile on the AT. A couple of small climbs in the morning and great views from Goose Eye Mountain. Incredible amount of great trail work has been done around Goose Eye Mountain. Overall, Maine trail maintenance is better than Vermont and New Hampshire. Mahoosuc Notch is a 1 mile long boulder jumble that is infamous on the AT. I had to take my pack off on two occasions to squeeze through narrow tunnels and lots of butt sliding to traverse rock drop offs. It is very difficult, but I actually took my time and had fun. However, after you complete Mahoosuc Notch you are faced with a climb up Mahoosuc Arm, which involves a 1500 climb in 1 mile. Also it started to rain as we started climb. Many sections are solid granite/slate and when wet slippery. This was a tough/difficult climb, probably my most difficult on AT so far.  Made it to Speck Pond Shelter and get out of wet clothes. Satisfied with miles and getting Mahoosuc Notch and Arm done. Took a couple of ibuprofen, ate a sandwich and went to sleep. The amount of lifting your legs do to reach a step/rock, using your arms/shoulders to pull yourself up a ledge has increased significantly.

I took me a while this morning to get my hiking mentality. It was a put my head down and hike day. Day started with steep/rocky climb up Old Speck Mountain, followed by long descent to Grafton Notch. My knees were screaming at me, which normally occurs on long descents. Utilized a couple of Vitamin I for relief. Climbed Baldplate West, 1000 feet in .8 miles, i.e., steep. Trail was not as rocky, which helped with climb. From Baldplate West the trail heads up Baldplate East. Baldplate East involes traversing solid rock up the mountain, not rock climbing, but walking up rock plates. Views at top were outstanding. As you look out on Maine I am struck by the absence of homes, power lines or any evidence of civilization. All you see is the green of mountains.

I sampled a few but they were not ripe yet. The hikers behind me will have a feast. It was sunny today with temperatures in the upper 80's.  Many sections were exposed which increased the temperature and water consumption. I have said many times that the trail provides in a variety of ways. Mid afternoon we were coming down a long steep descent and were surprised with Trail Magic from Teddie and Bruce, a couple from Maine who pick out various spots on the AT and provide Trail Magic. It was just what we needed on a hot afternoon, hamburgers, hot dogs, chips, bananas, homemade blueberry muffins and cold drinks. I even took a hot dog and muffin for dinner. Big thank you to Teddie and Bruce, a delightful couple. Enjoyed an outstanding  view from ME 17. Finished the day with 4 mile hike to Sabbath Day Pond Lean To located on a picture postcard Maine lake. Once again, I am exhausted and ready to go to sleep.","Old Blue Mountain

Sabbath Day Pond Lean To  - ME 4 Rangely 9.4
It rained last night, hard at times. A group of teenage girls from Quebec were tenting near the shelter. In the middle of the night a couple of them let out a blood curdling scream. Everything was OK, but it startled me. They stopped by the shelter this morning and apologized. Clear and sunny this morning with cooler temperatures. Trail was better from a Maine perspective, not great, but easier than the last 3-4 days. Short day into Rangely, Maine. Staying at Farmhouse Inn. Plan to rest and small resupply. Right knee is bothering me on descents. I have a misaligned knee cap and I hope it is not signaling a more serious issue. Subman, Suds and Rabbit  are also staying here. Rabbits wife was gracious and shuttled us into Rangely for a restaurant and IGA run, Thank you! Plan to slack pack tomorrow a 15 mile section.","Sabbath Day Pond Lean To

ME 4 Rangely Maine - Perham Stream15.3
Slack packed today over Saddleback Mountain and The Horn. Weather was cooler and cooperated to allow outstanding views. About 4 miles of trail today was above tree line and exposed, but fortunately no thunderstorms. Felt very good this morning and handled climbs with no problem. However, later in day as I was descending my right knee became very painful, to the point it was difficult to raise/lift it off ground. At one point it locked up on me and as I fell forward one of my poles went in a hole and snapped in two. Now I had a right knee that was painful and only one pole, not a good afternoon. I basically limped the last 3 miles. I have a misaligned right knee cap that up to this point has not bothered me, it flared up today. I plan to see a Doctor in Rangely, Maine tomorrow. I am concerned, only 200 miles to go and now an injury. I am extremely frustrated and concerned.","ME 4 Rangely Maine

Visited Rangely, Maine Family Health Center as they opened at 8 am. Hoping and praying they have treatment options. I can deal with some level of pain or discomfort, but what I experienced yesterday afternoon would make it unsafe to continue. I do not want my AT journey to end like this! I weighed 177 lbs. at the clinic. This is good news in that my weight has stabilized in the 180 - 175 range. They referred me to Franklin Health Orthopedics in Farmington, Maine. X rays revealed misaligned knee cap or medical term Patellofemoral Arthritis- Dysplasia. Treatment was a Cortisone shot. I am hopeful and confident this will help me to continue journey. Very appreciative of Stacey from Farmhouse Inn and Steve Coates from Franklin Health Orthopedics for their help today, it may have saved my hike. Plan to hike on tomorrow morning. Some of you may remember a 67 year old hiker with the trail name Inchworm disappearing in 2013 and her remains and journal were found last fall. She left the trail to go to the bathroom and apparently became disoriented and could not find her way back to AT. A large search was conducted at the time of her disappearance and she was not found. She kept a journal for 21 days before she passed away. We hiked by the area where she disappeared and remains were found, sad story.","Perham Stream

Perham Stream  - Crocker Cirque Campsite 9.6
Big Thumbs Up to Stacie & Shane who operate Farmhouse Inn in Rangely, Maine. They provided invaluable help with my right knee issue and repaired broken hiking pole and run a great hiker hostel. Hiked near the US Navy Survival, Evasion, Rescue and Escape (SERE) school, near Rangely, Maine. It is a school to teach Navy pilots, aircrews and SEALS, techniques to avoid capture and deal with capture. It is located just off the AT in remote section of Maine. Today was a test for my right knee. Started with 1000 foot climb in 1 mile up Lone Mountain followed by ridge line walking. Knee felt fine. Next came a 700 foot climb up Spaulding Mountain. As we were descending we passed a bronze plaque marking completion of the last section of the AT from Georgia to Maine in 1937. The real test was a 1500 foot rocky steep descent from Sugarloaf Mountain in 2 miles. Felt some pain and discomfort in right knee, but as I reached the bottom it improved. Only hiked 9.6 today to set up trip into Stratton, Maine tomorrow and give right knee rest and let Cortisone shot take full affect. On balance I am pleased with hike today and minor right knee discomfort. The pain was not close to what I experienced on Sunday. Hopeful improvement will continue. Camping by a babbling brook, literally, very soothing and tranquil. Another ""Pine Sol"" day in the Maine woods, vèry quiet, peaceful and few people.","Perham Stream

Crocker Cirque Campsite - Stratton ME 277.3
Up early to take on climb up South Crocker and North Crocker Mountains. Elevation  4228 feet followed by 3000 foot descent over 5 miles. This was a big test for my right knee. Some discomfort early in the descent, but combination of Cortisone shot, knee brace and Ibuprofen seems to be working. I believe it takes the Cortisone shot a few days to fully kick in. I am determined to push forward unless pain simply becomes unbearable or poses a safety risk. Reached the 2000 mile mark on AT early this morning. Resting today and plan to hike 17 miles tomorrow which takes us over the Bigelow Mountains. I am told by previous thru hikers that clearing the Bigelows is significant in that the trail relaxes a bit and I am through the difficult section of South Maine. Words cannot express my appreciation for the words of support and encouragement I have received from friends, families and individuals I do not know. Believe me your support drives and motivates me - THANK YOU!","Crocker Cirque Campsite

On the trail by 6:30 am in anticipation of long tough day and high humidity. Today we hiked the Bigelow Range, which consists of South Horn, Bigelow Mountain West Peak, Avery Peak and Little Bigelow Mountain. Ranging in elevation from 4145 feet to 3010. The challenge is that they are spaced in a way that you are constantly going up and down, the roller coaster effect.  Pleased to have this section complete. Hiker intel is the trail relaxes after East Flagstaff Road, we shall see. A portion of hike today was above tree line and views were outstanding. I continue to be amazed as I gaze out, in that I see no power lines, buildings or signs of people. You feel very alone in Maine, just mountains, ponds and green trees.","Stratton Maine ME 27

Great burger last night at White Wolf Inn, Stratton, Maine. It was the best burger I have had on the trail. Terrain today was gently rolling and much easier than terrain up through the Bigelows. It rained most of the morning, but the afternoon was cool. Maine has been unusually dry and rain is needed. I have noticed as we reach the summit of our climbs a clicking noise. Could not figure it out initially, but it was the sound of dragonflies. I have never seen this concentration of dragonflies. Reached Pierce Pond Lean To around 3:30 pm. The Lean To overlooks Pierce Pond, which is another postcard scene with no homes on Pond, just an unspoiled setting. In order to cross Kennebec River the ATC provides a ferry, fording is strongly discouraged. However, the ferry operates between 9-11 and 2-4, thus we could go no further today. We plan to reach the Kennebec River in the morning and take 9 am ferry.","East Flagstaff Road

It rained most of the night and all day. Not a hard or cold rain, but wet. Second day it has rained all day. With the abundance of roots and rocks on the trail they are extremely slick and you must exercise extra caution. I slipped and fell once today, but no damage. Enjoyed a great breakfast at Harrison's Pierce Pond Camp. It is one of the few remaining Maine sporting camps. Breakfast was 12 apple and blueberry pancakes, sausage, eggs and orange juice, great way to start the day. Took the ATC provided canoe ferry across the Kennebec River. There are hydro plants up river that release water, as a result fording is strongly discouraged. Trail was fairly easy based on Maine standards, thus able to complete almost 19 miles. Only significant climb was Pleasant Pond Mountain. Pushing to reach Monson, Maine on Sunday","Pierce Pond Lean To

Bald Mountain Lean To  - Lake Hebron, Monson, Maine18.7
Rained during the night and was raining as I started hiking this morning. It rained as I climbed Moxie Bald Mountain, but cleared up and sun came out as I reached the summit. With rain, rocks and roots are extremely slippery and your foot moves as you step on them. The trail followed the Piscataquis River most of the day and sound of rushing water is soothing/calming. Crossed the river several times that required fording with the assistance of a rope strung across the water. My feet were wet all day. Reached goal of Monson, Maine. Staying at Shaw's Hostel and will resupply tomorrow and arrange food drop for 100 mile wilderness. The 100 miles wilderness is the final stage of AT before you reach Baxter State Park. It has limited road across and is remote, thus the recommendation to carry all food for 100 miles or have a food drop halfway through. Plan is to traverse 100 miles wilderness in 6/7 days and reach Baxter State Park on August 21/23. I imagine cell service will be limited, thus journal entries may be delayed.","Bald Mountain Lean To

Started the day with great breakfast at Shaw's Hostel. AYCE pancakes, bacon, home fries and eggs. Perfect hiker fuel. Spent the morning arranging food drop off on Thursday in 100 mile wilderness and getting food supply for early in week. A little information about Monson, Maine. It is known for its slate quarry. At one time it supplied slate for blackboards in schools around the country. Sadly, the town looks like it's best days were in the past. It sits on a beautiful lake, but does not have the vibrancy of most lake towns. Highly recommend Shaw's Hostel for AT hikers. Today we entered the 100 mile wilderness, which is the ""home stretch"", hard for me to believe. However, I am ready for this journey to end and return to my normal life. Most AT thru hikers I talk to have the same perspective, they are tired and worn out and ready for it to end. Passed several lakes today that were gorgeous, unspoiled. Trail was constant up and down with normal Maine roots and rocks. We did not get on the trail until 11:30 am, but still completed 10 miles. Camping by a stream with sound water rushing in the background, passed a waterfall near campsite.","Lake Hebron Monson Maine

Hiker intel is that the first 35 miles of 100 mile wilderness are tough and the last 65 are easier and you can make up time.Today was tough/difficult hiking with undulations being the best descriptive term. No big climbs, but constant up and down with multiple rock climbing and scrambling sections, it just wears you done. You never get an opportunity to generate a hiking rhythm. Not complaining, just describing, again the trail is the trail. Mid morning we noticed a sign on a tree announcing trail magic 1/8 down a gravel road. What a pleasant surprise Birdman and Scout were cooking hot dogs and had cold drinks and beer for hikers. They own a cabin in the 100 mile wilderness and were honoring Birdman's son, who passed away last year. He was an AT thru hiker, again the trail provides at the most opportune times. Thank you! Despite tough hiking terrain we were able to complete 17.5 miles. Campsite is on the shore of West Chairback Pond, beautiful secluded Maine Pond. It was spitting rain as I set up tent and then stopped. However, about an hour later the wind picked up and it rained hard with significant winds until about 2 am. Tent held up, thank goodness.","Little Wilson Stream Campsite

Another day with undulations as the description, more up and down with 3 good climbs near end of day, another tough day. The kind of day where I keep my head down and just grind it out. Passed through an area called ""The Hermitage "", which has white pines that are over 100 years old. This area also included a 2 mile section of trail that was flat and smooth, it felt great to move quickly without rocks and roots. Stopped for the day at base of White Cap Mountain at a stealth camp site near White Brook Trail. White Cap Mountain is the last significant climb before I reach Mt. Katahdin, YEAH!

Day started with climb up White Cap Mountain, our last significant climb before  we reach Mt. Katahdin. Unfortunately when we reached the summit clouds obscured our view. However, the sun came out and started to clear. On our way down we got our first view of the ""finish line"", we could see Mt Katahdin in the distance, i.e., about 70 miles away, but very distinctive. It was by far the tallest mountain to the north. My hiker intel was correct in that the trail relaxed after we were up and over White Cap. In fact, in the afternoon the trail surface was flat and easily able to pick up the pace. Walked by another post card pond, Crawford Pond. Beautiful, serene and unspoiled. Our scheduled food drop from Shaw's Hostel arrived at 6 pm and included a couple of Mountain Dews and Root Beer. Also able to unload trash. Tenting next to Cooper Brook with sound of rushing water in the background.

Hike today was typical roots and rocks for the first 10 miles, but did level and smooth out the final 10 miles. About 5 miles from Katahdin Stream Campground I was passed by three Park Rangers who had received a medical call from a hikers emergency notification device. We later learned the hiker was air lifted off the trail via helicopter, not sure of the hikers status. On a more positive note, I was about 2 miles from my destination when I looked up and saw Jill and Aubrey coming down the trail. What a wonderful surprise and reunion. We hiked the final 2 miles to Katahdin Stream Campground together. I had not seen them since May 24.

Today was the day I have looked forward to since March 9.  Every thru hiker that begins their journey at Springer Mountain, Georgia dreams about climbing Mt.

The 5.2 mile hike is tough with significant elevation change, along with technical rock scrambling and boulder climbing. I am proud that they accompanied me and completed this difficult hike. Special thanks to my hiking partners who pushed me, encouraged me and motivated me along this journey; Steve the Hiker, Volunteer Dave, DC, Mom, Orbit, New Dave and last but not least Forrest. I spent portions of the last 5 1/2 months with this group and learned much from them and enjoyed their company. Thanks to all who have offered support and encouragement during this journey, it has motivated and kept me going during difficult times, i.e., I could not have completed it without you! This has been an incredible experience and allowed me to see 14 states in a way that most people never will. I know I can accomplish any goal I set my mind to and push myself beyond my comfort zone.

Katahdin is a tough hike, but each persevered and reached the summit. In fact, Whitney who has run marathons and completed Iron Man Triathlons, described the hike as ""brutal"" and said she would rather run a marathon. Enjoyed lunch at Appalachian Trail Cafe in Millinocket, Maine and signed my name to a ceiling tile as a 2016 Thru Hiker. After finishing we took a side trip to Bar Harbor, Maine and visited Acadia National Park. We rented bikes and toured the park, took in the views from Cadillac Mountain and spent time in Bar Harbor. It was a great way to unwind. The first night in the motel room Jill called my name several times and I did not respond. Aubrey called out ""Hooshr"" and I immediately responded.
