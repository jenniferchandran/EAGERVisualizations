Doubletime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533997,"The first thing to solving a problem is admitting you have one. I admit that I have been a workaholic for 31 years, 28 of which in my own business. In between work, I have tried to squeeze in some life and minor adventures around the few hours that weren't work.Lost a friend two years ago now at the age of 52. Gained some clarity that I never had before that working like crazy now to enjoy life at some later date, may never come. Not a mid-life crisis at all, but a better understanding of the preciousness of ever day. While I love my job, I have not always been a good businessman and I have wanted to make changes. Couldn't seem to make them though, because I always seem to caught in the storm that was business and life. The answer I came to was to close my business and attempt to thru hike the AT and catch back up on some of the living I have missed. When I return, I'll reopen my business, but in a fashion where it does not rule my life. Breaking away and closing is hard, so I am going to start and stop for a week or two to wean my self away._______________________________________________________________________________So I find myself racing to Amicalola Falls before they close the office at 5:00 May 13th, after getting up at 4 am. to work an 8 hour day before. Traffics terrible and I don't make it till 5:02 and the office is closed. I am blessed that the ranger sees me lurking outside the front door and allows me to come in and register - hiker #1806 for 2016. 30 minutes later, I am parked (atop the stairs mercifully) and strapping on my pack for the 6.2 mile hike up the mountain with 3 hours of daylight to make a run towards Black Gap shelter. 2 1/2 hours later I pull into Black Gap having made good time up the hill to find probably 15 tents littered around. All would be well, except as I unpack, I realize I have strapped my solar charger to one of my outside pack compartments. As I climbed, the swinging of the charger and its weight has unzipped a compartment and I lost my only change of clothes and socks somewhere along the 6 miles up. End of an eventful day, but happy to be here and getting ready to start.","Approach trail

Doubletime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534007,"Up early and out on the trail, despite not having slept to well. Have heard stories of how bad the snoring is in the shelters, but never expected to be kept up spread out sleeping in a tent like I was last night. Was up the mile and a half to Springer Mtn. by 7:00, signed the book, took a quick photo and was off. Going to have to use the phone sparingly as the cool morning has already to started to zap my battery. Felt good to finally be making miles and ready to get down the trail. Rolled thru the morning pretty easily and only began to tire a bit around Sassafras Mountain. Rolled into Gooch Mountain Shelter about 4:30 to call it a day. Another big crew of folks camping out tonight, which is supposed to be a cold and windy one.Overall a 17.3 mile first day. Not as far as I had hoped, but it will do.","Black Gap Shelter

Doubletime,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534012,"It was a cold and eventful night. Got down to 39 degrees and I had on everything I brought to try and stay warm. Like every 50 year old man, I can't make it thru the night without a nature break. Failed to fully zip close the tent door and was awakened by a mouse at 3:00 running over me looking for food. Felt like an absolute fool emptying my whole tent out and turning my tent upside down to dump him out. Another lesson learned on this shake down cruise.Up early again and on the trail before most were even stirring. By mid morning, started to develop some hot spots on the balls of both foot bottoms. Sure wish I had those extra socks I lost, as well as the luekotape and padding I forgot to bring. Pushed on and trudged up Blood Mountain on absolutely beautiful day. Got another hiker to take a photo for me and at least text it to my dead phone at least. Ended the day at Neel Gap and caught a ride to Blairsville for a good nights sleep.","Gooch Mtn Shelter
