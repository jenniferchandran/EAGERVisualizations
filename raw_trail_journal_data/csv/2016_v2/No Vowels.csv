No Vowels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480270,"Quick first entry. As I get going I will begin adding more detail.I decided last year to start getting healthy and then somehow got an idea in my head to hike the AT. The journey to doing so is going well, but it quickly became clear after a bit of research that a thru hike was not in my immediate future. Demands of family, job and financial realities will not allow it. Instead, I am now looking forward to section hiking.I have just begun purchasing equipment and estimate it will be at least a year before my first real AT outing. The plan for now at least is a 7-14 day trip each year. Each section, for now at least, will be in sequence of a normal northbound thru hike. Perhaps in later years, I will be able to take longer trips and possibly even finish off a major chunk of the last bits in a larger section.I have much planning and even more purchasing to do at this stage. The rough idea however, is to start of in GA late spring of 2016. Between now and then I will do as many local hikes and shorter overnight trips to shakeout my new equipment and myself.My dreams of a thru hike still persist. If the years treat me well and I am still able, a retirement thru hike would be an ultimate goal.",,First,"Jan 17, Sat",0
No Vowels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480272,"Short hike today. 6.6 miles with a great group from Nashville Hiking Meetup. This is my third outing on these trails and I still love it. Nice trails with decent elevation changes. Enough to still challenge me even as I am getting in better trail shape.This was my first real hike of the year as weather was finally nice enough and family obligations allowed.REI had an offer yesterday for a $20 gift card with a $100 purchase. Because of that and a $100 store credit left over from Christmas, I decided it was time to go shopping. I was not sure what was on my list to get when I went. I am still a bit overwhelmed at this point as I pretty much still need to get everything. Quite honestly, at this point, going to REI can be depressing. I need that and that and that and that and... Well, I can afford a new pair of socks maybe?I ended up getting a pair of Leki hiking poles on clearance, a pair of Orange Super Feet insoles and a pair of REI CoolMax Ecomade Hiking Liner Socks. (See my gear list) Tried all three out on this hike and could not have been happier. This is my first time using poles. Although they were a bit overkill for this hike, I definitely enjoyed having them and felt less concerned about rolling an ankle on the many hidden obstacles.I felt so good after the hike was done, I am going to to see if I can talk one or more of my kids to go for a further walk. My Fitbit step count is already near 20,000 so I figure why not push it up and to over 25,000.This hike also has given me the confidence to search for a longer hike for next month. My goal is to do a good hike at least once a month. I'll try to up the mileage as I go and also include some overnight and long weekend trips as permissible. All this will be in addition to my daily step goal of 12,500+ and regular local hikes and walks with the family each weekend.If all goes to plan, this will all have me in good shape to begin section hiking the AT in 2016.",,"Beaman Park, TN","Jan 17, Sat",0
No Vowels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480388,"My wife and I are doing all we can to encourage our kids to be active. For me, I hope to get them hiking with me as much as possible. Eventually I'd like them to come on longer and over night hikes. Ultimate goal is to have them section hike a few parts of the AT with me.For now, we are starting with a bit slower pace. Since we were all of for MLK, I decided to do an impromptu adventure to Fall Creek Falls park. The park is less than 2 hours away. I had not been there for almost 20 years and I thought it would offer many interesting activities for the kids.We were not disappointed! After lunch at one of the many scenic picnic areas, we headed out on the trail. We decided on the Paw Paw trail as to take it a bit easy. I believe the trail is only rated at 2.5 miles, but with side trails and other planned detours, we racked up a solid 5 miles. All in all a great hike for the kids and I. They loved to the overlooks and especially loved finding a few good climbing trees.I am definitely inspired to come back again. Hopefully we will have a chance in late spring to come back and camp.",,"Fall Creek Falls, TN","Jan 19, Mon",0
