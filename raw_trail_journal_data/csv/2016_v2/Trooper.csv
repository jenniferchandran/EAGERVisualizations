Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522893,"Well the Pack is full, I am almost afraid to find out how much it weighs. LOL! Seriously, I quit training last week to give my body time to rest and recover prior to the start of my hike and also to begin craving exercise and miles from the missed workouts. I won't bore everyone with a description of everything that I'm taking right now, but I'm sure that I will eliminate or change some things along the way. But most of the gear has already been broken in on previous hikes and camping trips over the past year and seems to serve me well. There are a few weight sacrifices that I made for convienance or comfort, such as my tent being a little heavy, but it suits me. Can't wait to get started. My family is driving me up to Amicalola Falls on the 11th and I start hiking the Approach Trail on the 12th. I just hope that I can make the entire Approach Trail on the first day. Lots of food dehydrated and ready. Lots of maildrops planned. Thank you Tonya (my wife!) for all your support. I know that this is going to be hard on you especially. Thanks to the rest of my family and friends and especially my karate family for all your support and encouragement too! Hope to see and meet a lot of new friends out there on the Trail!",,Amicalola Falls,"Mar 08, Tue",0
Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522935,"The pack is heavy!!! Emptied it out. Pared down everything even more! Food for 5 days weighs in at 11 lbs. That's the heaviest thing in my pack. Clothes are Pared down to the bare minimum. Tent is 3 lbs, a little heavy, but not bulky. MSN cooking set, removed 1 pot. 
The conclusion, it's the pack itself that is the heaviest thing. A High Sierra 90 L. I think the materials that it's made of are just very heavy. We will see.",,Appalachian Trail NB,"Mar 09, Wed",0
Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523009,"1st maildrop is on the to Neel Gap. Called the place that is receiving the drop and they tried to convince me to just resupply along the way, which I intend to do too, but it will be nice getting packages from home and friends (hint-hint!)
Everything but electronics and camelback is packed and ready to go. Pack is heavy, but I don't know what else I can leave at home.",,Amicalola Falls,"Mar 10, Thu",0
Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523105,"Well packing is done. I know my pack is still too heavy, but I think that it's the pack itself. I've pared down everything that I can and I'm still at 50 lbs without water. Leaving early in the morning. Amicalola Falls here I come!",,Amicalola Falls,"Mar 10, Thu",0
Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523150,"Slow start, but on the way to Amicalola Falls Lodge. In the 80's here in South Florida. Can't wait to see what the weather is going to be like up there.",,Amicalola Falls,"Mar 11, Fri",0
Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523258,"Made it to Amicalola Falls Lodge last night around 9:30 pm. Did a quick nighttime hike to the top of the falls with Brandon, Kayla and Robbie. Had a decent nights sleep and woke up early. Now for breakfast and then to hike down to the Visitors Center, sign in and get my AT passport stamped and get a ride back up and start heading to Springer Mountain from there. Tmobile signal is almost non-existant here so who knows what it's going to be like on the trail. I couldn't add any pictures to this post.  Will update when I can. Check out my posts on Facebook too!","Amicalola Falls

Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523313,"Did the Approach Trail from Amicalola Falls to Springer Mountain shelter area today. According to my GPS on my phone, I ended up doing 13.33 miles today! Not bad for a first day. Got to the shelter area after 6 hrs of hiking. Felt like I was doing so slow. I'm not used to all the steep inclines. I didn't figure on the Approach Trail being so rough. Lol. Set up camp, got water, cooked and ate dinner, cleaned up and went to bed. Hopefully.its going to be a good night!","Amicalola Falls

Trooper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523613,"Well it's been an interesting time so far. The first night I made it through the Approach Trail and camped at Springer Mountain Shelter. It started pouring down heavy, blowing rain, all night long! My tent leaked like a sieve!  The next morning I ate a cold breakfast, protein bars, packed up a very wet tent and hiked on. Met a lot of interesting people along the way, Disco, Gina from Australia and her dog, Steve, Dustin, etc! Made it to Hawk Mountain Shelter with enough daylight left to set up my tent and let it dry out some before settling in for the night. That was a night peaceful night, plenty of beautiful stars in the sky, a bit on the cool side for me, but tolerable. The next day started heading north again, got rained on a few times, but barely even felt it. The difference in scenery throughout the day waswonderful. Everything would be dead, then you would turn a corner in be in a tropical rainforest. Made it to Gooch Mountain Sheltwr, kinda early, but decided against going any further. I wanted to experience actually sleeping in a shelter and there was one space left on the top level. Settled in and cooked an awesome dinner! Decided to settle in for an early night, but the other hikers talking kept me up and throwing in my two cents every now and then. As I was finally trying to sleep, my left side started giving me pain in an unfortunate, but too familiar way. I realized that I probably had a kidney stone or a kidney infection.  This kept me awake and in pain all night. Luckily there was a Trail Volunteer, Dave, who helped me hike north to Gooch Gap in the morning and then drove me to a hospital in Dahlonega. I was diagnosed with a 1.3 cm stone in my left kidney. Unfortunately they did not have a urology dept so they discharged me and told me to go to the nearest hospital in Gainesville Ga that could help me. I started hiking away from the hospital when I was discharged. Made it a few miles to a Rite Aid where I filled my prescriptions and asked about rides. No one knew of any, so I started hiking to the Hiker Hostel about 6 miles away and was picked up by one of their workers who told me that the hostel was full. He actually drove me past the hostel and dropped me off a couple of miles further and told me I might be able to get a ride to Woody Gap to get back on the trail.. I started walking north toward Woody Gap and attempting to hitch a ride. A mile or so later, I was picked up by two very nice young guys, Nick in Logan in a convertible mustang. Logansport Mother actually worked at the hospital in Gainesville, so they offered to give me a ride there, which I gladly accepted. They brought me all the way here, carried my pack in for me and gave me their phone number to arrange for a place to stay or a rode back to the Trail. So now, I'm waiting at the hospital with antibiotic IT'S going to see what happens now. Hopefully I will be able to get back on the Trail. But it's been an adventure so far! I have met a lot of really nice people. Thank you especially Dave (the AT volunteer) and Nick and Logan for all your help today.","Springer Mountain
