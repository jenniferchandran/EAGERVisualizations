We have dehydrated carrots, green beens, corn and peas. I am hoping for nutritious meals. Counting down to 25 days to go. All of us are very excited and a little stressing and anxious.We have had a very mild winter in New England until today. -15 degrees with many degree of wind chill. I am hoping the season didn't shift to be colder in the spring than usual. We had a winter trial hike in November and found our sleeping bags were not warm enough. I believe this is now solved and we have super warm bags, but truth be told I hope not to encounter -15' on the trail. March 10 here we come.",,food,"Feb 14, Sun",0

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523125,"Loon drove Bombadil and I to the airport at 5am this morning. As we drove on the entrance ramp to the airport I received a text that are flight had a 3 hour delay. Everything worked out fine. We switched flights and met our ride to the hostel at 4 pm. We made me ourselves a spaghetti dinner and we will have a huge hostel breakfast in the morning before we put on our first miles of out trek
Today's opportunity for learning: Seriously... On the entrance ramp... Just roll with it. We've got time.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523235,"I need life alert ... Help me I can't get up I hiked 18 miles today. Actually I did great and felt pretty good all day. I thought 18 miles was overly ambitious, but Bombadil is a goal oriented fellow. Take my picture I say. Bombadil cannot accommodate, he is busy hiking. We started at 9:30. We hike 2-3 miles per hour for 9 hours. We had 3 15 minute breaks. I was hoping for a longer break at some point to check my feet. Didn't happen, but they are in good condition. I may tape my toes tomorrow to prevent blisters under my toenails. This has worked for me before. The first day on the trail was really lovey. The weather is about 40' hotter than I expected. I have so much winter gear and it was 80' today. I did wear sunscreen, but I have some pink spots. We got back to the hostel about 7. It s taking about 21/2 hours to shower and eat. We went grocery shopping yesterday and got stuff for spaghetti and guacamole. Plus, my favorite recovery food chocolate milk. Movie of the night is mr deeds. Today's delight: the forest is mostly asleep and brown, but there are several areas that are awash in greens. The primordial rhododendrons that tower over the trail and fill hillsides by the rivers and the holly forest are so pretty. I love green. Today's opportunity for learning. I so quickly fall into anger. I tried to direct my thoughts to bring joy to my heart with each step. To breath. To imagine flowers forming on the earth with each foot kissing the earth. As my heart was pounding in my head I remember Sahse saying kundalini has risen when you hear that.","hkinh day 1 springer to gooch gap

Food in my belly, roof over my head and all is well. Instead we had a cool breeze and clouds to shield the sun on yet another 80' day. Another day accomplished. Feet are in good condition. Ankle feels tweeky after 12 miles or so. Missed a spot with sun screen. Today's delight. I am so thankful for the Hail Mary's offered in my support by fellow hikers on my way today.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523478,"I hardly know where to start... I slept poorly. We had hiked 14 miles on Saturday and I felt pretty good. There are jokes on the trail about vitamin I. Ibuprofen. I had decided since I did well and didn't feel too bad I would go without. Lying in bed and getting stiffer with more aches revealing themselves as the night went on I couldn't stand the muscle aches at midnight and got up for my vitamin I. I did some reiki which worked so well I had to stop because it was hurting. The time changed losing another hour of sleep and I started to get anxious about lack of sleep and the impending 21 mile hike in the rain. Ok I was anxious all along. We missed Hiker Hostel's amazing breakfast so that we could get a very early start on this very long hike. We have 5 days of food with us and there is a pretty big supply of ""left food"" in the ""hiker box"". So we had a fairly hardy breakfast of oatmeal and fruit. We were out the door at 7:00 in the dark due to the time change. 30 minutes later we as we step on the trail we must decide if we need our headlamps. The heavy cloud cover, fog and rain obscured dawn's attempt at light. It was late enough to expect we wouldn't need them for more then 5 minutes so we found the trail and got to it. It was predicted to rain all day. I had on full rain gear. The temperature was fine. It was actually much better for this New England girl to finally have a cool day 60's and relief from the sun. I was never cold. As I was happily hiking in the rain I was thinking of poems I wrote as a teen about how much I liked the rain. Quotes from movies. Goldberry, the river daughter's delight with any water encounter. I never came to regret any of these thoughts. I did genuinely enjoy the rain. It rained for 2-3 hours. This hike was so long for a couple of reasons. We had 2 options. Stop at 7 miles or stop at 21 miles. We assessed at 7 miles and felt fantastic. The rain stopped we are getting stronger. Can we do this 2 more times today. Why not try??? We stopped at a shelter at the 11 mile mark and soaked our feet in a cool stream and tried to dry our boots in the sun. We had brought dry socks to change into. We were very alone for the first time on this hike. We went hours without seeing anyone. At the shelter people started trickling in to hunker down for the night. It was 2 pm. This was our longest break to date. We rested for a solid hour. Then back to it. I was beginning to fatigue,but was still able to maintain about 2 miles per hour.At about 14 miles I started to feel like I was running into trouble. My body was slowing down and starting to hurt. I developed a blister on my little toe with nothing to treat it with it just got worse for the next 7 miles. Happiness was eluding me. Bombadil was as supportive as he could be. He would let me know our 1 mph would get us out at 10 pm. He offered to carry some of my things, even my poles. I declined the poles as the were propelling me and absolutely holding me up. I am surprised my arms are not more sore today. Sunset was at 7:30. We had 2 miles to go and had not summitted blue mountain yet. We supposed to call for our ride at the summitted with a time estimate for a ride to the hostel. 8:15 please. Darkness fell at 8:15. We had our headlamps. I made it down at 8:30. It's hard to describe what it feels like when you can't make your legs move as you wish them to due to fatigue. How much can a blister hurt and impede your gait. How there is no option but to keep going. The dismal trudge. I choked on tears more than once in those last hours. And the head lights shining at the foot of the mountain. I was smiling when I got in the car.","neels

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523528,"A zero day. It seems a bit early in the trip to do such a thing but as described I struggled yesterday and needed recovery time. I slept well. In fact I could have slept through breakfast. Most of the day was spent in solitude with the general bustle of hostel life flowing around me. After our cold pizza lunch we got to work on our intended project for the day which was to go through our packs for the very last time. I had told people at work my pack weight was about 30#. We had shipped our packs to the hostel and in the fury of sealing the box I stuffed in this and that with the other thing I might need and was shocked that my pack weighed in at 39.7#So, how many times can you go through a pile of stuff until it weighs 30#. All day it seems. My final pack weight was 32.2# with 2.6 liters of water and 5 days of food. In the end Bombadil was telling me to put things back in my bag. I said no. We are sending some warm clothes ahead in case I packed wrong, but I still have a wool shirt, wool hat, wool gloves, rain coat and pants and trail pants. With the warmest sleeping bag ever made. The other priority of the day was recovery. I napped, I stretched, I did yoga. I took my vitamin I.Today's delight. Taking a nap with reiki intention for strength and healingToday's opportunity for learning. It might take more than a day. Patience (is this a theme).","couch

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523640,"Today was just great. We got up early and missed breakfast again for the long shuttle to Unicoi gap. I felt rested and had some good energy in my legs. We said our good byes to hiker hostel hosts Leigh and Josh. And started our day. The weather was supposed to be hot and sunny so I started the day in just a tank and light shorts. Our first steps on the trail were at 8 am. We passed 4 hikers right off the bat who were dressed in coats and hats because it was actually 40' to start. They looked at me a little funny, but my muscles work so much better in cool weather. After my performance to Unicoi Leigh and Joash were a little skeptical that I had it in me to finish this hike by our 6 pm shuttle ride. There are some steep parts, they said. Some real climbs. This was true. But I can't help but compare to New England. I didn't have to climb 7 flights of ladders like climbing the Flume. There was not one step that was higher than my head like Katadin. Nothing looked like Garfield Ridge. Georgia is truly a walk in the woods. The trails are soft dirt paths that meander over peaks were there are glimpses of vast ranges of blue. Our hike was mostly just a lovely day in the woods. We were hot tired and sweaty, but we both did well. We ran a bit short on water, but I had brought grapes and oranges that sufficed until we reached water. The birds have begun to sing and the grass tufts are turning green at the trails edge. Today's delight. It was a beautiful day and a great hike 16 miles well accomplished with an hour to spare for the shuttle. We had the chance to visit with other hikers / or their rides while we waited.Today's opportunity for learning. There is such a thing as too much vitamin I. My stomach was roiling after just 24 hours on Ibuprofen. It just hurt from 2 am to 2 pm. And there is no getting away from your own stomach.","unicoi

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524014,"March 16. Today was challenging. Today was the first day we picked up and hiked with our 32# and 38# bag. We had slept at the budget inn in Hiawassee Georgia. This place was sufficient for our needs, but made me appreciate the regulatory state of Massachusetts. Our shuttle from dicks creek gap was a rickety van with holes in the floor boards and upside down leaking transmission containers on the floor with the folgers tip can. Please do not forget the gratitude I felt at being picked up or the kindness of our driver. Do not take for granted that I was happy for one more night in a bed, but this reminded me of the ancient vehicles my father drove in my youth aka the putput.But today is for reals!!! We put in at dicks creek gap. ""Cheddar's"" mother and father set up breakfast of pancakes, eggs and bacon for anyone heading out on the trail. We had just eaten so we had a beverage and started our trek. That is what they call trail magic. I heard later that when breakfast was being cleaned up a new crew came for lunch with hamburgers. Our goal was 12 miles. It was about 70'. With our now fully laden bags and what seemed like a continual uphill climb our new pace of 1.2 mph we made only 10 miles. I was happy Bombadil did not fuss too much about plan B, but now he thinks we are going to hike 15 miles per day. I think we need a plan C. The really good news is we made it to North Carolina. We are sleeping in our tent next to the boarder tree in a new state.Today's delight. The dusty trail sparkled in the sunlight. Today's opportunity for learning. If you hike north all day in the sun, then your shorts clad legs are facing south all day in the sun.","dick's creek gap

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524016,"March 17. Top o' the morning to you. I slept 11 hours. It felt sooo good. I woke up lazy and warm in my bag with a breezy wind blowing. 7:30-6:30. For the most part I slept well. The moon was so bright it woke me up at 11pm and I was aware the the new load bearing was effecting my hips. I was wearing my buff (thank you Serena) and I slid that over my eyes for complete darkness the rest of the night. Bombadil had been awake for an hour and already anxious to throw down the miles. It took us 2 hours to eat breakfast and break camp. At 8:30 we started straight uphill again. As I was concentrating on my Lamaze breathing trying to take down this hill Bombadil says, ""14 more miles honey."" I immediately stopped breathing. I will let you recollect your own L&D scene to imagine what happened next. They day carried on uneventful and beautiful. We had an upward climb til about 1 pm then the terrain finally tilted downhill for 4 gentle miles. At some point my foot began to hurt. I convinced Bombadil we should stop before it became more of an injury than a twinge. We stopped at beech gap tent sites 3 miles short of our goal. 12 miles for today. Today's delight. This was the most beautiful hiking day yet. High 60s light wind. Clear skies. Today's opportunity for learning. No matter how much Bombadil helps me I am not hiking fast enough to alleviate the pressure at the end of the hike to enjoy the day or spend an hour at noon doing yoga as I had dreamed I would be able to do when I started. It truly seems to miss the point of such an adventure.","bly gap

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524020,"March 18. I slept poorly again. It felt like I didn't sleep at all, but Bombadil assures me I slept plenty and I had energy all day to hike. I woke up at midnight. The sky was inky black with brilliant stars. The Big Dipper and Scorpio were among the display. I finally rousted myself about 5:30. It took us 2 hours again to break camp and have breakfast. Bombadil was eager as ever to get underway. I was slow because I wanted to stay under my blanket instead of putting it away. It was probably in the 40s and not light out yet. I have been waking and dressing in my lightweight hiking shorts and today since it was cooler I wore a wool tee shirt. To stay warm I wore my rain jacket. Everything else has to get packed. We had our oats and tea then off we went just as rosy fingered dawn crested the surrounding mountain peaks. Our first stop was the shelter 3 miles down we had originally aimed for. We saw cheddar, mcfly, chomp and Kenya. They make a lot of noise, but they are really funny. At the shelter we met crocket and princess. Martian, owl and Elliot. Morning Lori and pinky were all people we leap frogged all day.Again I must say the hike was wonderful. It was an easy hike all day except for 500 feet up Albert mountain. I was hungry, I was thirsty, it was 1 pm. Food... Up, up, up. Luckily, no matter how hard 500 feet is its only 500 ft. We reached the top, sweet relief, and our comedy crew was there. There is a fire tower at the top of Albert mountain. I climbed the ladder and finally got my hour of yoga on top of the world.We finally did a 15 mile day. It was an amazing great day of hiking. Another perfect hiking day high 60s. Sunny, light breeze. I kept after Bombadil all day for a zero day worried about possible snow, but he wouldn't have it. In the end I felt great and Bombadil began to feel broken down at the end of the day. We ended at rock creek shelter just a few miles short of the town of Franklin NC. We have 2 more long days before we get a break at NOC and a box. Today's delight. Owls swooping over our tent and hooting at night.Today's opportunity for learning.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524140,"We slept our fist night under the roof of a shelter. There were only 3 of us under the protection of the shelter, many chose the privacy of their tent. We had thought there might be rain or even snow during the night so we opted for the roof. The shelter was partially rebuilt because trees had fallen on it during the winter. It was missing a broom and the floor, which is probably typical, was very dusty dirty. I felt we might have stayed cleaner in our tent if that could even matter at this point. I slept fair and woke up rested enough. The time change is nice due to light later at night, but morning in the darkness can be.... Challenging. I started to pack my things at 6:30 worried about disturbing our bunkmate. Once my bag and mat were packed I dragged the rest outside to pack my bag and take down my food bag from the trees. It started to mist. So my things got damp. Bad timing on my part. Bombadil decided to skip breakfast due to the mist, but I insisted and ate my oats and tea. By the time I was done eating the mist stopped. We began hiking at 8:00. I still had my rain gear on. It both kept me warm and made me very sweaty. It was much cooler this morning with thick low lying clouds. Unfortunately, With Bombadil's first steps he knew he was in trouble. His ankle got worse throughout the morning. We hiked 3.8 miles to winding stair gap and a parking area where it was clear we were going to town to rest Bombadil's ankle. It took a while to get a ride. Hitching did't really work for us. A man arrived with his horse Bo and I asked if he would call for a ride for us as he had cell service. He was so kind wearing his fringed chaps and his sweet horse Bo. I of coarse dropped my bag on the ground right after I said hello. He was curious and asked if he could lift my bag. 32# I said. He said that's not too bad. Before we got a call through a couple came to the parking area. Becky was dropping off her husband an ultra runner ""100 miler"" to exercise their dog. She was happy to help us out and drove us to the Sapphire Inn. I tell ya, priorities are simple. Shower and food. Bombadil washed up and elevated and iced his ankle. I ran around town gathering supplies for ankles, food and washing laundry. Mexican burrito for lunch, delivered pizza for dinner. All you can eat pancakes and bacon free at the Baptist church with free shuttle. I'm still hungry. I can't say enough about how awesome the church folk are in Franklin. Beyond nice. For 4 weeks every spring they gather all the hikers from all over town and feed them. Once at the church hall they have you write a note home and give you a picture to send home as well. All they want is to fill out a survey so they can continue to improve as a hiker town and offer you a prayer for success on your journey. They have been doing this for 8 years. They have you sign this years poster and take you back to your hotel and welcome you to come again the next day if you're still in town. Gratitude, gratitude, gratitude. Oh, sweet thanks. How can I say how awesome this is. Bombadil was tempted to get back on the trail, but I really insisted that was a poor choice. I'm hoping 1&1/2 days with no walking will suffice and we will be back to the trail tomorrow. After breakfast.Today's delight. I kind of missed it, but a pack of wild boars ran through our camp the night at the shelter.Today's opportunity for learning.

But anyone who knows Bombadil knows a day off is never a day off. We started with the breakfast at the baptist church. With pick up and drop off. Then we tested his ankle by walking around. In a two block radius are 4 Mexican restaurants. We found an authentic grocery and bought fresh churros. For most of the day we lounged in our room. Left over pizza, movies on FX and sleep.Towards evening Bombadil wanted to test his ankle again so we went out in search of food. We ended up finding some really nice beer at the Lazy Hiker and at Mulligans a really nice burger.Today's delight. I didn't expect such a fits and starts beginning to our hike.

Bombadil got a text later in the day to say their first day was a success. We had packed last night and left out only our hiking clothes. We were ready to go at 6:30. Bombadil finally conceded to staying in town for breakfast. Since the shuttles for breakfast are so full we didn't want to inconvenience anyone with our bags so we decided to walk. And Bombadil wanted to test his ankle one more time before we really left town. It was still dark out and chilly. We were the first there, but the pancakes were hot and the bacon was crispy. Our hosts were cheery and welcoming. Bombadil had called for a ride, but all the shuttles were booked. We ended up getting a ride from one of our hosts. He drove us to the trail head and reported it was 32' and wished us luck. Someone was just coming off the trail and was very happy to get a ride to town. I'm sure they were frozen. It had snowed in the mountains and some reports said 16' overnight. A third person had snagged a ride with us and asked if he could hike with us as he wanted to hike slowly due to a foot injury. Booksmarts stayed with us most of the day and we enjoyed his company. Eventually he went ahead. He had hiked most of the trail in 2011 and left in the white mountains due to Lyme. I hope he doesn't get derailed this time. We hike to Wayah bald which had a stone tower on top. The sun was warming and we were protected by the warm stones. I climbed the tower, but it was cold and shady on top. I clicked a few pictures of the panorama and ran back to the sun. About a mile past the summit was the Wayah bald shelter which we decided to stay in. It was a little early to quit for the day, but we had done more than 10 miles and Bombadil's ankle was still ok. So we stopped. We were early enough we got a spot inside the shelter. It was very clean. We set up and I started working on a fire. Everything was still wet from the snow. I gathered what looked like a respectable pile of duff but it didn't light. Bigfoot came along and spent the rest of the night tending fire. We also had a volunteer wood gatherer so we had a lovely fire. It was still so cold Bombadil and I went to bed at about 7. It took a while to warmup my down sleeping bag, but once I did I was warm all night. Today's delight. Being showered with diamonds as the sun melted the ice tipped fringes of the trees.Today's opportunity for learning. I wore my rain gear as protection for the cold and wind. I got soooo sweaty.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524508,"March 22nd. Everything is gray before dawn. The sky is gray. The trees are gray. The litter of leaves on the ground is gray. Even the rhododendrons have their own shade of gray. The night was cold, probably 20'. Mostly I stayed warm, but I had to get up during the night. I dreaded it, I waited. Then I couldn't. There were 8 people in the shelter. I worried my rustling would disturb every one of them. I extricated myself from my bag and tried to find my shoes. I ended up with one of mine and one of Bombadil's. Once out of the shelter it was so bright with the full moon and her planetary visitor nearby I didn't need my headlamp. Did I mention cold. I was surprised when I got back my bag was still warm and everyone still seemed to be snarfling in their sleep. I stayed snug until 6:30. Bombadil had already started to get ready for our hike as did ghost rider. I tried to change in my bag. Tricky. I think I was on the trail by 7:00, in the dark. The moon had set and I was surrounded in gray. The first color laid itself orange in a thin line across the horizon until that magnificent splash brings color to all the earth.We hiked until the next shelter where we stopped for breakfast and refreshed our water supply from a stream. There were shelters every 5 miles. We had decided to try for a long day and reach NOC Nantahala outdoor center. If we got tired we had options. At the 10 mile mark there was a lookout tower. We rested here to stretch. We got some trail magic from TINS there is no someday. He hiked with his 14 yr old in 2006. Bombadil noticed a fire in the distance from the lookout. It looked far away and not near where we were headed. 2 miles later Bombadil had gone ahead of me a bit. Normally, this irritates me because I like to be in shouting distance if one of us were to get hurt. Now, I was scared. Smoke had overtaken the ridge. The breeze that was normally cool was wafting heat towards me. The occasional ash floated by. Breathing was uncomfortable and the smoke gave me a stomach ache. My fearful scenarios included being cut off from one another and trying to get off the mountain on unmarked ways. Eventually, I fought up to him. He was even more worried than I and he was having trouble breathing. He had ideas of running the next 5 miles. After 12 miles this was not an option for me. And stopping before NOC was not an option either due to the smoke. After 16-17 miles we made it to NOC. We got a bunk room and had a nice dinner. Food solves so many problems on the trail. As we went to our bunks the full moon was cresting the hillside. She is so beautiful.Today was my first giant black snake.Today was the first day a hillside was covered with wild flowers of spring.Today's delight.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524601,"March 23rd. I had a hard time falling asleep due to the arduous day. I have been avoiding ibuprofen for over a week but decided in order to sleep I would take some. I also employed some reiki. My hands were so hot!!! After that I slept pretty well. We got up about 7:00. Breakfast starts at 8:00 so we started to go through our bags. After our night in the shelter we just had to organize better. Bombadil had packed my sleeping bag at the shelter and tore the stuff sac. In addition to getting our first box that we sent ourselves we had to purchase a stuff sac for my bag. Since we are in the south I decided to have biscuits and gravy. I can't say I'm a fan. Bombadil ended up sharing his breakfast with me. Afterward, we went to the center to get our box. The NOC is a huge compound with an outfitter store, 2 restaurants, kayaking, rafting and many bunk room buildings. So we bought the stuff sac. I got a better pillow and we went back to our bunk room to finish packing with our resupply. I would say the morning was everything I had hoped. We slept in. We ate food. We were not in a rush to pack. At 11:00 we started up the hill. The particular hill was unique as it never really ended. Miles wise I'm not which was longer today or the day up to Bly gap. At any rate we hiked 6.9 miles uphill and got to our camp site at 4:30. They say hiking the Appalachian trail is 5 million steps and a few of them are going to be bad. My first misstep I was skipping along finally enjoying a bit of speed on a slight downhill and caught my toe. Usually my poles catch me, but in this case I was stopped by my face hitting a rock. To add insult to injury I was pretty much upside down. I was pinned by my bag. I started crying once the shock of impact was over and I felt trapped under my bag. Bombadil was near enough for rescue. He sat me up and and got my pack off. I washed the dirt off. Mostly, I was not injured. I have a bump on my forehead and 2 small scrapes. Up we got and on we hike. 1 more mile to the campsite. I had my first hiker bomb. A packet of Raman noodles mixed with potato sides. It was Soo good. Today's delight. First swallowtail butterflyToday's opportunity for learning.

Her companion, sun, was not yet ready. In the darkness we prepared our oatmeal breakfast and our english breakfast tea. Bombadil had let me rest while he ran about getting ready for the day because I had another terrible night sleep. Did I lie down too early with my tired legs?? Did the hot chocolate keep me awake?. My hiker bomb was filling at dinner, but with no protein I was hungry at 2 am. What do you do when you are hungry and all your food is hanging in a tree??We packed up and were underway at 7:00. It was cool, probably 50'. I knew the forecast was 70' so I was in my shorts and tank. We had considered hiking on 1 more mile last night to Cheoah bald. Some people we were familiar with, gummy bear, next step, morning Lori and big foot had. We decided not to because of water and privy and fatigue. Although they were cold and had endured a windy night the view from the bald was amazing with moonrise, sunset, moonset and sunrise with the blue mountains in the backdrop was spectacular. In hiking it seems we go up and down mountains a lot. That is what we did today. We had a particularly steep climb for a mile or so called Jacobs ladder. After that Bombadil's ankle hurt enough to stop for the day and rain was predicted for 4pm so we stopped early. We had a spot in the shelter. Pros... Not cleaning up a wet tent in the morning. Cons... Dirty. I think the rain will continue until 9 am. I'm hoping for a late start tomorrow, but we have 11-12 miles to go tomorrow to reach Fontana dam. Today's delight.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524871,"March 25th. The fog floated through camp and the cloud laid upon us throughout the morning. Bombadil was up and cooking breakfast at 6:00. Bombadil, I said, I will get up when it's light out. Bombadil replied, it will be light our when it's done cooking. But Bombadil, says I, the sun rises at 7:30 and it takes 10 minutes to cook oatmeal. You are a math teacher, what part of the equation do you need help with. So we ate our oats. We took our time packing and ultimately Bombadil left 10 minutes before I did claiming he would be slow due to his ankle still being sore. 
I started hiking at 8:15. It was light out, but the air was thick and wet. The closeness on the mountaintop made only the surrounding trees visible. The forever rolling blue mountains we have become accustomed to were hidden from view. Lichen was dripping from every branch. For most of the day I hiked alone. I caught up with Bombadil in 45 minutes. I asked him if he has seen the sign someone was kind enough to post ""rattle snake ahead"". He had, but neither of us saw a snake today. I hiked ahead of him for a while, but I needed to stop at 10:30. I had mistakenly not doled out my snacks for the day. By the time second breakfast was at hand I needed to take apart my whole bag to get to the food at the bottom. I took a break and Bombadil went ahead again still worried his ankle would slow him down later in the day. After our break it was 2 miles uphill. I had maintained a 2 mph pace until this. I slowed a bit, but when we got to the 4 mile downhill I sped up again without falling on my face. The fog lifted by 11 am. The rest of the day was sunny and beautiful. I spent the day in the euphoria of strength, speed, sun and happiness. Bombadil did fine. I thought I was racing ahead, but every time I turned around he was right behind me. In the lower elevations trillium was blooming in yellow, purple and mixed. I also saw some columbine. We reached the shuttle stop at 3 pm 11.8 miles. 
We are staying at Fontana Lodge. Like NOC this is a huge compound/ resort, but even larger. It is luxurious and well appointed with a fireplace I am enjoying even now in the lobby. 
Even hikers that had not planned on stopping are lured by one last stop before the smokies, which seem a little daunting.
Priorities again are simple, shower and food. 
We cleaned up and went to the restaurant. We stood looking hungry at the door until they opened for supper at 5:00. Other hikers that waited said the line became so long they gave up on the restaurant and resorted to hiker food. 
Bombadil spent the evening icing his ankle. I got laundry duty again and was offered a beer or to on my travels by fellow hikers that were congregating. 
Today's delight. I loved being wrapped in a blanket of fog. The moist tendrils enveloping me and creating a solitude for just me.

We decided with Bombadil's ankle and the smokies ahead of us a rest day was in order. We printed out passes to the great Smoky national park. We have eight days to pass through 72 miles. We are hoping to get through in 6 days. We drifted through the day lazily with only a few chores to accomplish. Breakfast at 8 am. A shuttle ride to Fontana dam to hike 2 easy miles of our journey.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525087,"March 27th I woke to my favorite color. Chartreuse had painted the valley in the night spring becoming visible as the sun rose this Easter morning. Our plan was to eat breakfast and head out. We missed the first shuttle, but we were on the trail by 9:30 slipping our permits into the great smoky mountain national park box and ready for adventure. This was another up and up and up day. We started in the valley at 1700 feet and are camping at 4300 ft. Hiking 13.5 miles today we both did well. Bombadil's ankle held up well. At the top of the first peak shuckstack mt was a fire tower. It was a ways off the trail so Bombadil declined. I was terrified. There was the typical 24 inch steps,but only one hand rail with no fence guard. At the platform there was no barrier at all. I'm not usually afraid of heights, but the fog was so thick and disorienting I went right down and caught up with Bombadil. After ten miles uphill out of the valley the hike became moderate and we went along nicely. The fog was very heavy all day moving toward rain at times. It was warm enough the rain gear was suffocating. I opted for hiking in a short sleeve wool tshirt and long pants. I tried a rain jacket a couple times, but it felt like a swamp almost immediately. We came to the first shelter. It was a very pretty stone shelter. We would have been the first to claim a spot, but we forged on to make future days easier. When we arrived a large group was there. I was worried we wouldn't have a spot in the shelter. Tents were up. So, we got a spot. I swept out our area and put up or beds. Bombadil cooked. The group that arrived before us had started a fire. It was so lovely to get warm by the embers.Today's delight. We are starting to see wildlife. 4 deer today.Today's opportunity for learning. The extra weight for the 7 day trip was very noticeable. It pulled on my neck like never before and the weight settling on my sacrum made my feet tingle. So, eat more and keep your pack off your sacrum.","fontana dam

I was so thankful for a place by the fire inside. There were at least 10 tents subjected to the elements. I slept extremely well and woke rested. Hiking seemed more difficult all day. It may have been the uphill the day before or no longer feeling fresh, but slogging through the mud all day really slowed me down. The fog was very dense. Bombadil was invisible 100 ft in front of me. It was not as warm today either. Again it was tricky trying to dress correctly for the weather. My hair was dripping with fog. Ultimately I wore my rain coat over my tshirt. It was cool enough that I didn't sweat as the day before. By 1pm the sky was clearing. On top of the ridge the views were quite nice. On one peak, ready for a break, I threw my pack to ground and landed on it so as to catch some beautiful rays. I also had cell service so I got all practicle and real life oriented and payed my mortgage.I felt as though I didn't eat or drink enough all day. By the time I got to the shelter I was ready to be done. Bombadil had gone ahead of me hours before. In the morning he had hoped to go on the the next shelter. He was ok staying at Derrick knob for the night. The area outside the shelter was littered with tired hikers sprawled in the sun drying gear and hiking clothes.

We had some very good fire tenders that tried to keep us warm. In the morning someone peeped. ""Can someone start the fire."" In an instant we had flames again. Bombadil had us hiking by 8:30. It was hard to tear away from the comfort of the shelter. We stepped away from the shelter onto the now frozen ground covered with hoary crusted leaves. Frozen earth alleviated the slogging through mud. Dressing correctly was again a challenge. It was so windy still. I wore my long sleeve wool shirt and my down jacket. I also had on my wool hat. Within 200 yards I took off my jacket and hat. It was still very cold but that motivated us to hike quickly and we maintained 2 mph most of the morning. We stopped at every shelter along the way for short breaks. At 1 pm we had a long break basking in the sun and stretching. Our next stop was clingman's dome the highest point on the Appalachian trail. For being so high it was not a terrible climb, but I was getting tired. At the peak there is an observation tower that is fun to climb with amazing views. Even though it was Tuesday afternoon apparently it is school vacation week and the attraction was filled with people. We heard that there was a gift shop with food. Being very hungry we went to check it out. On the way we fantasized about chips and Gatorade. Maybe pizza or trail magic. For the one mile walk we got water and a chocolate bar. Seriously disappointed we got back on track for 4 more miles to the next shelter. The ground stayed frozen all the way up the mountain and back down again. Today's delight.

We had our fire starters again, but the wood was so soggy the fire was hard to start. The glow of the fire flickered until my eyes were closed for the night. I had a hard time getting warm. It may have been because I hiked cold all day. Once warm I stayed warm. The morning was frozen again but Bombadil had breakfast ready for me in the darkness and we watched the alpen glow glaze the horizon as we ate. We had planned 15 miles today. I knew it was necessary but was not excited for that many miles after our climb over clingman's dome yesterday. We hiked along with fresh energy and tired legs as best we could. The first several miles were downhill. At the 5 mile mark was a parking area. Bombadil kept hoping for trail magic. I didn't even want to consider it after our last disappointment. He was right. A women's hiking club had gotten a permit to sit in a national park and be nice to us all day in the freezing cold and wind. They were as happy to see us as we were to see them. They offered fresh fruit, soda, sweets and chips on their fold out table. They told us everyone reaches for the fresh fruit first, as we did. Next was salt. I had 2 bags of chips and a soda filled with sugar. That gave us energy as the next 4 miles were uphill.At the 7 mile mark was a shelter. Tired and discouraged I insisted we stop here for a long break. I threw myself on the ground and took a short nap. I could still hear everyone chatting around me. There were several families on there way to Charlie's bunion. It was a 4 mile hike from the parking lot. Many people made the trek. A Russian family Bombadil was excited to talk to offered us some treats and a fresh apple that I saved for dinner. The next 7 miles were just hard. I was slow and tired. The views were spectacular. It was a beautiful day. The sky was clear and blue. It was almost warm. The blue mountains were rolling on forever. We walked along a ridge and knife edge so beauty was in Both directions. I kept getting slower and slower.At the 2 mile mark Bombadil went ahead to secure a spot in the shelter. A steady stream of people passed me. I was excited to see many familiar faces. Next step changed her name to not a bear. Morning Lori dashed by with her friendly Maine smile. Kaio told me her name meant fire and gave her courage. Canuck so happy to be surrounded in such beauty said he just wanted to sit and drink coffee gazing at the wonder around him, ""right on,man."" Finally, I was there. Everyone was happy to see me when I arrived. Bombadil had gotten us the last 2 spots. I had defenders saying, "" Bombadil left you?? We can talk to him."" No, I say he was walking on my heels.

After 2 hard days I took my time in the morning and was ready for hiking at 9:00. As I was slinging my pack to my back a hard wind started to rip at the tarp of the shelter. The weather was changing. Rain was predicted for our hike today. I felt groggy and tired. I was not finding my groove. After a couple hours I was frustrated that I was not finding my second gear or my second wind to move along at a nice pace. Bombadil tried to give on me advice on my gait and mentioning that it was flat so I could quicken my step. Seeing a 7% grade in front of me and not feeling generous I whipped around a death stare and suggested we hike separately for a while. We would meet at the next shelter.I arrived at the shelter at noon. I was beginning to feel more myself. I had taken Benadryl the night before to guarantee a good night sleep. The effects were finally wearing off. My speed was improving and I didn't feel so cranky. I met Bombadil as planned. We had a lunch break with hot tea and carried on the trail together. The trail finally slanted in my favor, downhill. The rain was misting throughout the afternoon. I finally felt the happiness of the trail enjoying the mist on my face and the clouds rolling down the mountainsides. Something has shifted so that I am now identifiable as a through hiker. No one asks how long are you out for anymore. They say, you look for real. Are you a through hiker. What is it I wonder? Am I dirty? Are my clothes no longer shiny and new looking? Is there a difference in my stride or a look of intent? Am I pleased by the distinction?I spent some time hiking with Canuck. He is funny and happy. He is a fast hiker and he loves coffee. He said he met a 4x through hiker and asked for the advise from his experience. The through hiker said be flexible. Make due with what you have. Sleep where there is space and eat what is available. Canuck said his challenge of hiking was giving up the control in his kitchen where he makes his 8 cups of perfect French press coffee every day. What is my challenge? Am I flexible enough to take the next step and be satisfied?Today's delight. Mist. I love the mist brushing my face. A sweet kiss from every river on the planet.Today's opportunity for learning.

Last night I walked into the shelter and the girl on the top bunk said sorry we are full with 6 people and a foot and a half between each person and the guys on the bottom bunk were willing to sleep shoulder to shoulder with 8 people to keep us out of the rain. There were periods in the evening that were clear and one of the hammockers decided to give more room and sleep outside. During the night at about 1 am an ocean of rain poured upon us. Interestingly there was only one clamorous bang of thunder but it shook us in our stone shelter. It woke everyone and we laughed. After that I didn't sleep much. I had so much compassion for those in tents and hammocks. I asked most of them how they faired during the night and most stayed dry and were not bothered over much by the rain.Being tired we started hiking at 8:40 am. 2 miles up then the rest of the day would be downhill and out of the smoky mountains. Bugs our hiking companion for the last several days missed his family and after a month of hiking is going home. We enjoyed his company immensely. He hiked our speed, he got up early with us and he was our expert fire starter. He gave away what belongings he thought would be useful to people and got a ride to town to drive home to Ohio. At the exit of the national park I thought I would be done for the day but our hostel was 3 more miles away. The day was supposed to be 40% chance of rain, but it was just beautiful instead. Sunny. Warm. A little humid and the trail was wet but not too slippery after the rain. As I walked along the trail the rivulet turned into stream then into waterfall then river with white water rafters floating by. I was sorely tempted to jump into the stream but I didn't know how much further I had to go. On the last mile of my hike for the day I heard rustling in the leaves. I clacked my poles together and looked more closely. Crickets kept from the dry leaves as they were fiddling their evening symphony.I arrived at standing bear hostel. Bombadil had gotten there before me and handed me a pizza fresh out of the oven. That was the highlight of my day. After that my lesson from only yesterday was tested. Release control, go with the flow. CHALLENGED!! After 6 days in the woods I wanted a hot shower more than I can tell you. There was no hot water. I was so mad. My mood festered until I decided a 40' shower was better than none. The privy was awful. The portapotty needed service because it was filled to the top and the outhouse smelled terrible.

Because I was awake, because I was one of the few women in the bunk room, because I have reiki, because I was still not right with the world? Kitty snuggled in and stayed with me until my breathing was quiet and even, asleep. I woke up tired still. Packing was a chore. Bombadil fed me a sausage and egg sandwich and paid our bill. We were off on our 16 mile adventure by 8:00. I was so tired from not sleeping well for 2 days I felt choking tears all day. My legs for the most park were strong, but I was getting ahead of myself and just feeling overwhelmed. 16 miles... We stopped at a shelter after 5 miles. Some people had service and discussed the weather. 20s with gusts of wind 40 mph. Super. The shelter we were headed toward was reportedly a nicer shelter and somewhat protected from wind. After 5 more miles my strength was waning. Both Achilles' tendon were pulling with each step and the arches of my feet were threatening to cramp. I was going along and I saw a sliver of road. The tears started to roll down my cheeks. Why would a road elicit such a response? People might be near? As I rounded the bend hope sprung and tears came more freely. A fire. A group of hikers. A canopy. A grill. Food. Hunger, joy and gratitude. Trail magic. The Orrs, ""hiker family"" 2015 were giving back to the trail. Their family of 7 had completed the whole trail last year. Bumblebee, the dad, manned the grill. Hot dogs and buns, soda and chips, buckets filled with home made cookies and brownies. They had been there all day and had started with pancakes. Someone later noted they were holding the canopy down with 6 gallons of syrup. Their plan was to stay there until the food was gone then go hiking. We still had more than 5 miles to go. The food and rest did wonders. But I was tired. We kept hiking. At the next gap 4 miles later right before ""max patch"" one of the 40 best spots on the trail. Was more trail magic. To make it even sweeter we had met goose and cap, the pack it out boys, who were offering trail magic, twice last year. They were also giving back to the trail. I hope no one is surprised I ate my fill 2 more hamburgers, soda, fruit and a shot of rum. We also met the guy struck by lightening 12 times. He was there offering fruit and soda. His wife was hiking, but he had to stay off mountaintops.One more up. So tired. We climbed. It became so windy even with our poles to steady us we side stepped off the trail. The top of max patch is all grass. 3/4 of the way up we began to know this is special. We fought against to wind to the top. There was no holding the tears. Was it the wind in our face? No, no it wasn't. It was true wonder at the beauty to behold. Bombadil and I gazed at each other both with tears streaking our face. Where are we. It is so beautiful. How are we here. We leaned in for the tenderest kiss and looked at the wonder around us. We leaned into to wind as if to fly and gazed at the world below and it was good.We hiked 2 more miles to the shelter.

The wind was gusting enough to crack some branches and 3 people ended up thinking it was safer in the shelter after all. Cold, cold, cold. I had hiked in shorts all day and was never really warm enough so it took me a while to warm up and then warm my bag up. I was mostly warm for the night in my zero degree bag. So the big fibber told me two 16 mile days to hot springs and I pushed so hard to make it happen. Somehow it turned out to be 16 then 18 miles. So here we stand 18 miles to go. How much do I want a shower and clean clothes?? 18 miles that's how much. I was cold all day previously so I overdressed in the frozen morning. I never really stopped. I had 2 short food breaks and a couple drink breaks, but I mostly just kept going. I was hot. I did t drink enough. I probably didn't eat enough. I just kept going. I did reasonably well until I didn't. At 17.5 miles I was looking out 100 feet above the town of hot springs and my feet cramped up. I couldn't walk. A half mile of switch backs is all I had left. So close and yet so far. Ugh!! I joked and said."" There's a taxi waiting for us at the bottom right?"" No. Bombadil went ahead. I waddled as best I could slowed to a near standstill. He had gone far enough ahead to procure water and put his pack down so he could carry mine. At the very bottom of the hill was laughing heart hostel. I was greeted by the sweetest most caring people you could imagine. A picnic table was right at the trails edge. The manager wouldn't let me stand for a moment longer and ushered me to sit. We discussed lodging options and he offered to drive me anywhere and use the phone to make arrangements. After several phone calls and strikeouts on Sunday evening we opted to stay at the laughing heart lodge instead of the hostel because I wanted a real bed and a bathtub. The lodge also is a bed and breakfast, so, yum, food. I wanted Epsom salts for my bath and he offered me a ride to the pharmacy. When he found out what I wanted he said, ""we have that, I'll give it to you."" Wow. How nice can people be. He brought over 8 pounds of Epsom salt and a bucket to soak my feet. After showers, food. I had recovered enough with drinking and soaking we were off walking again to get food. We went to the iron horse. We had great food and were satisfied. Walking back we met our hiking crew.

We would find a lee spot to have a breakfast bar and maybe the next shelter for a real meal. We left shortly after 7 am and started hiking. The morning was 4 miles downhill to the road. It was moderate and not too hard on the knees. Because we had only had a bar to eat we were hoping the road would offer some treats of some sort. Trail magic or a store. No trail magic. 100 yards down to road I saw a sign. It was a thin metal square with the word "" MOM'S"" spray painted on it. Hmmm. It didn't look quite real, but maybe. I was really hungry. There was a police vehicle parked in the parking lot. I could ask him if there was food nearby. He drove off as I approached. Moms still didn't look real. The windows were covered with cardboard, but there was an open sign flashing. Bombadil thought I was silly for trying, but I made him open the door. Yep, open. It looked as inviting on the inside as it did on the outside. Half the ceiling was missing. The wires to the private fridge were frayed. There was a couch and 2 chairs with brown floral from 1970 with cupcake foil for ash trays on the armrests. He had 2 fridges and 2 freezers for hiker food with yesterday's coffee warming on the burner. He greeted us by saying I'm the son. Mom passed in 2012. Oh, I'm sorry for your loss. I say. Well, we all have to go through it sometime or other. He said. His character became ever more interesting as he ventured into politics. Jesus was a democrat because he road a donkey. Etc etc.In the end I am thankful for the character at Moms. I had a v8 and 2 jimmy dean frozen breakfast sandwiches. I left fed and full. We then carried on the 6 miles uphill off the road. We planned on stopping at the shelter for lunch. Bombadil went ahead a I slowed on the long uphill. Cheddar and Golly caught up to me and cheered me on as my energy was flagging. The shelter is right ahead I'm sure of it they said. They went passed me. I sat and drank some water then carried on. Shortly ahead I saw Cheddar. What are you doing going downhill I said. I came to get you!! We are at the shelter!! I thought you would want to hear the good news. She got behind me and we marched the last little bit. Oh, thank you so much Cheddar. Wanting my to look brave I hid my tears of gratitude.Looking at the map the next 4 miles look like a lovely ridge walk. What we got was a white mountain preview. It was cold and windy. I was still in a tshirt. I had considered changing many times but I didn't want to get my warm clothes sweaty. The ridge was quite tricky. It wasn't a razor edge per se but it was narrow and rocky with poor footing and very hard wind. I was definitely pushed about with no room for error. Bombadil had gone ahead long before and I was grateful to be hiking with Doc as my companion. We were matched for hiking speed and he was definitely watching out for me. We stayed together until the last mile. I had to get more food and dress more warmly. My arms were bright red with cold. I ducked behind some fallen pine boughs that blocked the wind and ate some sausage and cheese, gorp and drank some water. The last 1-2 miles wasn't bad except the whole day suddenly seemed long and hard. 15.4 miles. My hiking company cheered and was glad when I made it into camp flat footed and tired.Today's delight. Cheddar and Doc as hiking companions.Today's opportunity for learning. Jimmy dean breakfast sure tastes good when you're hungry.","spring mountain shelter

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526843,"April 7th. Bombadil had gotten us one of the last spots in the shelter. Bumpy came in after and everyone made room for one more. We were 9 people in a 6 person shelter. Shoulder to shoulder. It was still cold and windy with rain predicted. A nice fire was going outside with many people gathered round, but I just wanted to eat and get into my sleeping bag.The rain came as predicted during the night. Afterward it was warmer and the air was still. In the morning the fog was heavy. It was so thick it was difficult to find the trail to the privy even with a headlamp. Bombadil had breakfast ready by 6:30. It took us a long time to get ready as everyone started to stir and then pack and eat. We were 2nd on the trail at 7:50 am after bumpy then quickly passed by shaggy and purple haze. We hiked a wonderfully easy 6.4 miles to the next shelter where we ate and took a moderate break. I had hoped to stay longer but I wasn't warm enough to stay and relax. It was 3 miles to the next road. We had planned ongoing to the next shelter 5.6 miles uphill from the road. I had been feeling very overwhelmed and choking on tears by our big miles of late and wanted to have an easy day. I had hiked 9.6 miles already. It's not like I was a slacker or anything. You can't even call that a nero day. Bombadil acquiesced. We would find hiker paradise. We ended up on the wrong road, but wee gillis's mom who is hiking and currently in Damascus gave us a ride and drove us all the way to the hostel. They just opened a month ago, but they have everything that we need. A warm room, a bunk, a shower, laundry, food and a ride to the trail in the morning. We have decided to slack pack the next 2 days. 21 mile tomorrow and 11 to uncle jonny's hostel the next day. So we will stay 2 nights in paradise. Today's delight.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527011,"April 8th. With trepidation I agreed to hike 21 miles slack packing southbound from Spivey gap. My last 21 mile day, day 3, was a total fail. Blisters, crying, rhabdo, required zero day to recover. I did not want to repeat that. We are approaching one full month of hiking and have covered over 300 miles of terrain. I am stronger. I can do it. We had planned on leaving at 7:30. Due to usual delays in waiting for people to get ready and the long winding drive to get there we started at 8:30. The first 7 miles were uphill to big bald. We started in the cold and as we gained elevation the sides of the trail became covered with snow. There were still little yellow flowers poking through the white fluff. Up and up and up we hiked. Ever so much lighter without out heavy packs we were able to maintain 2 mph all day. 
The top of big bald was similar to max patch. It was grassy covered with beautiful vistas in all directions. Today however it was wind swept and covered with snow with snowflakes blowing hard around us. I dressed well for today. I had my long sleeve wool shirt and my raincoat. I forgot my gloves which I missed in the blowing wind, but my coat sleeves are long enough to wrap around my fingers and that was sufficient. It's interesting that only small adjustments in clothing can effect your hiking temperature. Zip, unzip. Sleeves around fingers, sleeves rolled. Buff over ears and forehead, buff pushed back off ears and forehead. Just these little things can mean the difference between sweating and cold. Because bad weather was predicted I brought by down jacket, but I never used it.
After this snow capped mountain peak the next mountain was a meadow cover with grass and sun. We were able to take a nice break to eat and take care of our feet while sprawled In the sun. This was our halfway point of the day. We continued to hike up and down up and down for 5 more hours. Most of the trail was still snow covered. At times the snow fell while the sun was still shining. At times it was snowing quite hard and the trail blazes were obscured, the mountain outlines were obscured and we were covered with white balls of snow. The last 8 miles were hard. Up 2 miles, down 2 miles, up 2 miles, down 2 miles. Our feet were getting tired. Our knees were getting tired. 
In the end we hiked 21 miles in 11 hours. Not bad. No injuries, just tired. We returned to paradise for showers, pizza and a bunk in a warm room. 
One interesting thing about a long southbound day is we got to see where everyone was on their hike. We saw cheddar and owl who hike 25 miles into the night and a blizzard to get to cheddar's parents. We met golly and squintz. As they continued north now a day behind cheddar. We met 2 of the hikers that stayed with us last night who had started in the opposite direction. We met many new people that we hadn't seen before. t the last shelter we caught up with Bigfoot, gunny bear and Spartan. 
Today's delight. All types of snow. Snow in the wind, snow in the sun, blizzarding snow, snow with flowers peeking through, snow on the trail.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527151,"April 9th. We woke after a delightfully sound slumber in our warm bunks to a very cold morning. After our 21 miles we were not eager for an early start. We lazily waited for everyone else to start out and we finally got our bags packed to be transported to uncle jonny's hostel in Erwin tn. Jerry ,hiker paradise 's proprietor ,drove us to spivey gap and we headed north with our light slack pack gear with food and water for the day at 9:50am. At the trail head we saw golly, squintz, slam and recon coming down big bald. They were completely frozen from their night out and getting picked up to go into Erwin. It was supposed to be an easy 11 miles. We did well. I dressed the same, wool shirt with long sleeves and rain coat to keep out the wind. The morning was cold 32' with some wind. The trail started covered with snow. And again from the road we go up. It wasn't bad for elevation gain today. We had 2 miles up off the road then only one small up after lunch. The rest of the day was downhill into Erwin tn. We had lunch at no business shelter. The sun was finally shining and warmed us as we ate. The rest of the afternoon was temperate and pleasant. Even though we had a great day I wouldn't call it easy. We were tired when we got to uncle jonny's hostel. Lisa pepper comes through again with a package of awesomeness as do my parents who sent along my sun hat. My nose will be grateful. We booked a private room and crashed and slept until the free shuttle to dinner and shopping at 5:30. We ate at a Mexican restaurant and I partook in a lovely margarita or two. While at dinner others we have lost along the trail show up for dinner. Savage, Moonboots, clutch, cool dad, shaggy1, shaggy2, medicine man, all come to the Mexican restaurant.I have good cell service for the fist time since before the smokies. We talked to verge and loon (now legs) on the phone and they relieved our worries. They have summitted clingman's dome and are now off the mountain in gatlinburg until tomorrow when the weather turns and life will be grand and beautiful. Our next stretch presents new challenges.

I left hiker hostel with 5 day resupply and water one month ago with a 32 pound pack and have been sending things home ever since. Ugh!! Knowing we are leaving town and that means elevation gain all day. With the new knowledge my pack weighs 5 pounds more than I expected was a blow!! Bombadil reminds me of all the things I have in my pack. Goldberry, you don't really need bubbles. But I know I do. Did you eat those oranges you don't want to carry them. I only have 3 I gave the rest away. But you have to carry the peels Goldberry. We ran out of fuel once so I am designated to carry a 3rd fuel canister, that's new weight. I have a long sleeved shirt of Bombadil's that I borrowed. I must return that. I bought a pillow way back and I love it. I ate all 3 oranges before noon. We came upon trail magic, hey everybody's sister, at 3 pm. They fed us and we chatted. We had a drink a sandwich and some sugary fuel. Before we left they took my orange peels. After our trail magic I was hoping for a short day. Bombadil had a place in mind he wanted to stay. "" beauty spot."" A bald mountain top 9.7 miles out of town.

Are you warm enough Goldberry? Well I sure dont want to get out of my sleeping bag and I haven't warmed it up yet. Do you want me to look for a new spot? Hmmm that's unexpected. Well mostly I don't want to get out of my bag. While staring at each other from our cocooned state Bombadil asks if I would be willing to move our tent. Sure. He went on a recon mission as the sun was setting. We had very limited time to find a new spot. After a half hour he came back. We threw our stuff in our bags and Bombadil picked up the tent with our sleeping pads and sleeping bags still inside. At this point it was dark and I followed Bombadil wearing my headlamp. It wasn't far down the trail to our new spot. He found a flattish space between two tress. All we had to do was put in the tent stakes and crawl back inside. We were much more comfortable and the tent was much quieter out of the wind.We slept reasonably well and started our hike at 8:50 am. We had planned 15 miles to the greasy creek friendly. It was beautiful all day long and the miles drifted by.Today's delight. Forest sounds. Robins singing threet. Wood peckers hammering different sounds on hollow trees.

The trail to the hostel was longer than expected. Bombadil had to chase me to get me back on track. We got a room in the bunk house. The main house has a rule posted on every surface. The first is take off your hiking shoes. The second wash your hands, dry with a paper towel then place the paper towel in the wood stove. Shortly after arriving and after a lovely warm shower we placed a takeout order. We were hungry. Bacon cheeseburger, fries and chocolate shake. Our Baptist hostess follows a kosher kitchen so when she called in our order the bacon was omitted. Dinner was fabulous. My burger hit the spot. The shake was amazing. Bombadil had wine that was given a blessing in Hebrew. God thank you for grapes. Cici has frenetic energy and lives in service to hikers. I went to bed with a full belly.In the morning we had jimmy dean and 2 cups of tea. It was supposed to rain all day. We decided to do another short southbound slack pack. We went to Hugh's gap with another couple that was northbound for the day and headed in the opposite direction. Our hike was 3 hours in a light mist. It was a beautiful foggy day. Our look out points were obscured, but I like the closeness of fog. We hiked 6 miles and returned down the same long path to the hostel.Today's delight.

When I left Massachusetts in early March I proclaimed to all who would listen. I intend to do my yoga every day at noon on a mountain top for an hour. In my naïveté I thought I could have expectations and assign blame when expectations were not met. I thought I could impress myself upon this journey.I have had many signals suggesting otherwise. My only injury I every got from yoga was last summer hiking in the white mountains. My quads were very tight and I did a deep knee bend. My knee felt very strange. It never hurt enough to seek treatment, but I still feel the weakness in that knee. We met carefree near Franklin. He relayed a story about a body builder. This body builder had attempted a thru hike multiple times. He knew he was strong why did he keep failing. One day someone watched he do his sit ups, push ups and pull ups and said to him. You are failing because you are still trying to be a body builder. Let the trail turn you into a hiker.In hot springs I met Kevin. He is a vegan that practices ashtanga yoga in Louisville KY. We spoke of yoga at length and our feelings about our yoga journey on the trail. He is a section hiker hiking 108 miles. He hikes from sun up to sundown at a fairly slow pace. He said the yogis of India don't want people practicing their poses outside. The body seeks equal even ground and that is very hard to find outdoors.Then there is Squintz. She came to the trail with similar expectations as I. ""I thought I would do yoga every day, meditate every day and read a book every week.. That hasn't happened for me at all.""The trail is its own journey. It has its own gifts of joy, learning and magic. When I get to Damascus I will be sending home my yoga mat (which is a camp towel) and my chakra stones ( yes I'm carrying rocks and until today have been essential equipment).

We met Pedro Dynomite and 3 men that had been at greasy creek showed up granddaddy long legs, just Greg, and Kentucky rock hopper. Magic man and sister and ferrel dad on his 65th birthday arrived. Later, a south bound dentist arrived nearly completing his thru hike. Overmountain shelter is an old rickety barn. We all slept in the upper floor. The bottom has a drive through bay and an eating area that faces an amazing valley view. We considered a fire for the night, but we had no real fire starters with us. Also, we all turned In for the night about 7pm. Lol!! We are all so wild. During the night I heard some scampering on the floor, but I really didn't want to know what was scampering.We all started rustling at 6:30. Pedro was first out. He stuffed his bag in his pack, had a bar for breakfast and off he went. The rest of us fiddled with our gear and food for the next hour and a half. I started hiking at 8:20 after spreading some bubble happiness to the mountains. Bombadil started later and quickly passed me. I didn't catch him again until 2 pm when he waited for me by the road.The rest of my hike was over the roan Balds. This is some of the most beautiful scenery on the trail. I would still say max patch is more beautiful, but my time on these mountains was different. These Balds are expansive. Mile after mile of wide open grassy fields at 5-6000 feet surrounded by mountains in all directions. The roan Balds are somewhat populated so the strictly undisturbed look is missing. This early in spring we got the sepia look. Nothing is quite green yet. I tried taking pictures, but a photo does not do justice. Again, perfect weather. Sunshine, light breeze, light frost in the morning warming all day.When I finally caught up with Bombadil we decided to go into town and stay at the bed and breakfast. Today's delight. As I climbed toward the sun the rays captured the silken spider's threads caught on each price of grass blowing in the wind. It looked like a shimmering lake.

We waited for our bee farmer to arrive and drive us. We got to the bed and breakfast at about 4 pm. We showered then our hosts shuttled us to a locally run BBQ. We had a fast service excellent pork meal and got a ride back. We chatted with out hosts as they prepared their own dinner and excused ourselves to the quiet of our nice room for the evening. TV was a let down. I watched magnum PI then tried to sleep. For some reason my muscles wouldn't settle. I felt very restless. I ended up texting Shelley Halkola for an hour discussing how to have a big foot sighting as her daughter knows these things and other similar news. What do I miss the most she asks. My friends.We were ready to go at 7 am. They dont serve breakfast at this particular bed and breakfast. We were taken to happy's cafe. We had a hikers feast and then happy's owner was going to take us to the trail. She was tied up with a very busy Friday morning crowd so we hit the trail about 9am. It was another beautiful day. Perfect weather all morning and into the day. We hiked at a good pace for 12.8 miles. At 4 pm Bombadil found us an incredibly beautiful tent site next to a water fall and splashing stream. It was nestled into a rhododendron grove and overhung on the opposite bank with wonderful rock formations.We haven't stayed in our tent that many times. We got to work setting up house. We found the flattest spot. Bombadil brushed the area clean. We pitched the tent. I am usually in charge of setting up the inside with our sleeping pads and bags. Bombadil busied himself with water and starting dinner. While he started cooking I found a spot for the bear bag and got a string up in a tree for later when we were done eating. Since it was early and such a nice spot I thought this would be a good day to make an effort for making a fire. I gathered some small stuff and Bombadil worked his magic. We had a comfortable small fire for 3 hours. Our dinner was the dehydrated food we had sent to ourselves from home In our resupply boxes. I had rice and beans with chicken and peas Bombadil had dried vegetables and chicken added to knorr noodle sides. The water drew me in and I splashed around some enjoying the cold water.

Oats and tea, break camp and pack. Bombadil sent me on the trail first and I was hiking at 7:15 in the daylight.We had 12.2 miles planned and it was another amazingly beautiful day. Sunscreen on and ready.. The joke of the day, it's flat we can hike 25 miles today. Sadly, they were all serious. Peer pressure was applied. I wouldn't have it. I had a map. It was not flat. Many people were able to put in a 20+ mile day. Bombadil hiked ahead. We had a box at one hostel and wanted to stay at another. He got to kincora hostel but no one was there then went to check us in at black bear resort. Black bear resort was very cute with tiny cabins and communal bathroom. ( no tubby at this resort). It had hiker food and a very nice atmosphere. We met the vagabonds. Badger, powder and 10'. A hiker family that started in February. They are at the resort for a week waiting for a doctor appt. it was fun to get their story, eat s'mores and watch tv with them.So, as I'm hiking my last mile I know I'm near the end. I hear a bellowing gooold beeerry! Oh! Gooold beeerry. Hello! I'm here I say. Bombadil sees me, but I'm still searching the woods. He cheerfully arrives, takes my bag and hands me a Guinness. No longer cold and definitely shaken I happily take a swig. Yummy! He wanted to catch me before heading to kincora. We walked the half mile on the road to black bear and settled in.Today's delight.

He didn't happen to be in the room when it went off. I was surprised he set it. We are always up pretty early. Ok, up at 5:30. It was dark. We knew we had a big day ahead of so we had checked out the night before and purchased our breakfast sandwiches to microwave in the morning. Bombadil took care of that and we ate our sandwich and drank our orange juice. We were packed, fed and out the door by 6:30. It was twilight. We had planned an 18.5 mile day. We had to do that because a large area of the trail was closed to camping, picnics and a shelter was closed due to bear activity. We started out through a really nice area that was"" for real"" flat. It was a winding trail along a river bank. It became technically difficult with steep stone steps up and down, but these did not last very long and we were rewarded with a beautiful waterfall. Early in the day we also had a steep 4 miles up 4 miles down. This mountain ended at Watauga lake which is a lovely park. I collapsed on the grass under a tree ( no leaves) for a little shade. It was getting hot.As luck would have it, Scoobie who is planning a through hike in 2018 with is friend, was getting ready for some magic. Bombadil had already been chatting with him when I arrived. I was thankful for the break and the extra food. I didn't think my ""bars"" would be sufficient to see me through 18+ miles. We took a long break and had a beer and 2 hotdogs. Our friends clutch, medicine man, Maria, savage and cool dad also stayed for trail magic. Bombadil advised me to take off my boots and soak my feet in the cold lake water, which I did. We were off to continue our hike. We had 9 more miles to go. 3 miles were pretty flat following the edge of the lake. All morning we had smelled smoke. I thought it was just camp fires caught in the valley. This contributed to my headache and fatigue. It was actually a real forest fire. Due to the bear activity there were many sidearmed forest Rangers all over the park. We asked them if it was a controlled burn. They said no, but it was safe to pass. The trail was not closed. 2 miles around the lake we walked along the ashen path with flames still flickering aside the trail. We passed about 10 Cherokee hot shots the forest ranger fire fighters. They said the cause was unknown, but it had been going 24 hours. They had fought the fire all afternoon till midnight then returned in the morning. They felt it was contained and under control. They had lit one side of the trail and blown the fire towards the center so it wouldn't leap over the trail. So one side ash, one side dry brown leaves. This continued for a mile. After the fire we were no longer in the smokes path. But it was getting very hot. Everything was exposed. There were no leaves to offer protection from the sun. The climb was relentless and steep. I had my sun hat on and sunscreen but I just started to not feel very well. I drank water but my thirst was not quenched. After a bit there was trail magic. ( I am so thankful for trail magic) Bombadil and I got the last 2 COLD sodas. I stayed and rested. Bombadil went on. I told him the next 4 miles would likely take me 4 hours and he didn't have to wait for me. If I had been smart I would have taken to ice water from the cooler and used aqua Mira to clean it. Instead I was pretty much out of water. The next water source was 3.5 miles ahead. I went along and the shadows lengthened. It did become cooler. My performance was as predicted 1 mph. I got to the water source, but I did not find water. I came across 2 tenters who had found a small pool of water. I just went on 1 more mile. Bombadil showed up at that time and offered to carry my bag. He had hoped I had gotten water. I told him I looked but didn't find the puddle everyone went for. Without my pack I raced to the shelter. Bombadil had water but it wasn't treated yet so I took care of that while Bombadil filled my 2 containers. Sadly, it was a very hard chore for him. When he got back I set up my things and we had a very later dinner. I didn't even feel like eating I was so tired and still had a headache. We ate and drank our fill. I hung the bear bag, but Bombadil had to add his food to it so I took him to the location. It was dark. We could finally go to sleep. After we went to bed savage came into camp. She had left the trail magic without her companions. On her way to the shelter she saw a bear. Very frightened she called cool dad who went to hike her in to camp.

We left with a quarter liter each. With 3 miles to the next water source. On the trail by 8:30. It was already getting hot. The hike went very well. We were ridge walking on a dirt path much of the day. To the right were small farms and pastures with rolling blue mountains behind. To the left was purple mountain majesty. At noon we came to the first shelter. While we were there we noticed the shelter was overrun by mice. They had no fear or inclination to hide while we there. Monster came by as we were eating for his much. He relayed that his group had lost two food bags hanging in trees to a bear that had come by at midnight. The excitement had kept them awake for hours as they were alert to each rustling noise. We stayed to eat then moved on. During the day I got overheated and had to take a break twice. I took the opportunity to hydrate and kept both water bottles refilled all day. With 4 miles left Bombadil went ahead. Monster came by and asked if I felt OK as I had draped myself over my bag. I assured him I had plenty of water and was just resting. Sweet potato came by next. I was ready to move on At that time and we spent the next hour hiking together. When we were on the last mile incline I needed another break and found a spring to fill up my water so she went on ahead.I got to the shelter at 5 pm. I felt like I was there early enough to enjoy the campfire circle (sans campfire) and friendship of my fellow hikers. We were with monster, sweet potato, oriel, wonder, Portuguese, ferrel dad and el tehano. Juanduerer came later with his banjo playing.

The sun met me at the top of the hill. I stopped early to sunscreen. Bombadil wanted to do 3 days to Damascus, so this was another big day. By the time we found a place to stay we had hiked 19 miles. In the morning I was impressed with my 2.25mph pace (which is still slower than everyone). I was passed by a new face My Way who said, ""aren't these Tennessee highway miles nice."" I don't get it. I think it's all hard. The end of the day was a decent into town. I had a similar (though not as bad) cramping of the feet and slowed down. Bombadil's shoes were starting to breakdown and cause problems so he was also cranky and quite tired of waiting for me. We crossed under the archway into Damascus. We are so proud of ourselves for meeting this milestone. 468 miles done. We are healthy and uninjured. Damascus is very hiker friendly, but they don't have hotels. There are many hostels and bed and breakfast establishments to choose from at any price range. The cheapest is The Place. It is run by a church and a 7$ donation is suggested and has a 2 day limit. We don't have cell service so finding lodging was just going door to door and hoping to find someone home at their bed and breakfast. We had 3 strikeouts and we both very tired with sore feet and very hungry. We came to hikers inn who had left his own phone on the porch to call for assistance. The reception was bad enough we almost gave up until someone popped around the corner to help us. He showed us all his rooms and we picked a very comfy spot.Shower and food, of course!!!Food options seemed limited. We went to hey joes a new mexican restaurant. We ordered beer and nachos and both had a burrito. We had hiker friends that kept coming in, but the restaurant ran out of food by 6;58pm. Can I tell you how disappointed a hiker would be to be turned away for lack of food. Today's delight. The May Apples are sprouting on every hill side. The pretty foliage looks like an umbrella.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529015,"April 20th. A zero day in Damascus. Our hiker inn was very nice. We had the upstairs and bathroom to ourselves with a large comfy bed. My first step out off bed was quite painful reminding me I had not yet recovered from the 19 miles hike. First order of business was an Epsom salt soak in the tub. Then we went out for breakfast. We found Mojo's that had a hiker special breakfast which was a very large mound of food with pancakes on the side. Bombadil and I both managed with no problem. Bombadil went to the post office to get our boxes. We had 3 waiting for us. A large box we had forwarded from hiker hostel in our first days of hiking, a box sent from home, and luckily Bombadil had ordered shoes just in the nick of time to replace his worn out footwear. I had intended to go through all my things trying to lighten the load, ( a shake down). I was not interested in much that was forwarded from hiker hostel. I added tweezers to my first aid kit and batteries. I went through my clothes and sent home my winter hat. I was ready to send home my boots but none of the outfitters had my size shoe. I threw away a shirt. I thought it was 100'/. Wool, but it is not. None of Bombadil's wool shirts got smelly, but this is the most offending piece of clothing that I own. Bombadil had extra shirts so now I inherited one of his. I sent home some first aid supplies and my Nalgene bottle that I had brought for below freezing weather . I will now use soda bottles for water which are much lighter. The other box was our regular resupply. I went through my food bag and got ready for the next 5 days. The afternoon was restful. For chores all we had to do was go through our boxes and send home our shakedown items before 4 pm. While Bombadil was out he met poptart. He was the very first hiker we met at the train station in Georgia. We planned to go to Mojo's together for dinner. It turns out he skipped ahead because they closed the trail due to the fire we had seen the day after we passed. I suspect it may have been closed due to bear activity as well. While we were there we met a south bound named mountain man. He had started in August in Maine. We was happy to tell us we're all the best hamburgers on the trail were. He said he really liked great barrington for a trail town with southbridge having the best burger he ever had.After dinner we went in search of hiking friends. We had a beer at hey joes with savage and cool dad. They did indeed hike 33 miles in 1 day arriving in town at 10:45pm. Upon arriving they met incredible trail magic were offered a stay on someone's lawn with fresh baked muffins in the morning. Sojo was also there with first hand tales of the lost bear bag and how he and his dog got to town with no food.Wondering back to hiker inn I sat in the outdoor area and soon a crowd gathered. Sojo had made friends at Mojo's at breakfast. Even though his birthday wasn't for 6 more weeks the sweet people he had met wanted to celebrate his birthday. They brought a fruit pizza with candles and we all sang to him. This was followed by more story telling. Bombadil adding to the stories with his post office adventure. He had a large box and an older fellow asked him if he needed a ride. Bombadil accepted. This 98 yr old Mr. Montgomery asked if he was hiking that new fangled foot trail they have going through town now.Today's delight. Story telling with trail friends.Today's opportunity for learning. Being open and candid with people can bring wonderful trail magic.","damascus

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529142,"April 21st. My stomach hurts. I have had trouble in towns before. My stomach is not tolerating switching from trail food to restaurant foods. I decided that I would take another zero day and let Bombadil hike 17 miles. We had planned on slack packing and returning for another night at hiker inn. I slept in and avoided eating all morning. Our room had already been reserved so we switched to a smaller room at 11 am. After the switch I decided I would go to the grocery store and look for real food. The store was a mile away on a bike path called the Virginia creeper. I really wanted Cheerios and a banana. Well, a hungry hiker at a grocery store after not eating all morning. Hmmm. I didn't do too badly with over shopping, but I spent a lot of money. Cantaloupe, pear, Apple, salad, avocado, cottage cheese, milk, onion, peppers, Cheerios, banana, steak for me and lamb chops for Bombadil. I also bought Nutella and peanut butter a trail staple that I hadn't carried yet.When I got back to our inn I ate my Cheerios and banana half a cantaloupe with cottage cheese. Bombadil was hiking so I sat at the table visiting and preparing for a grilled dinner chopping vegetables. Later I took another nap.Bombadil returned at 4 pm in time to check the post office for another package. It hadn't arrived so they will forward it to our next stop. He was in charge of grilling, but it was a combined effort that resulted in a lovely dinner. Salad with avocado and cantaloupe. Grilled vegetables, steak and chips for our potato dish. Sojo shared his whisky with highway. Flat lander and his friend went out to eat. I saw owl walking by and hailed him to come sit with us. Owl got our left overs. sojo's dog theo got all the scraps and bones. Sojo is a great story teller. We sat for hours while he and highway completed the small bottle of whiskey for cocktail hour. Poptart came in and out but relayed the sad news he is summoned to jury duty. He will figure that out tomorrow.I will skip ahead to where Bombadil left off today. Hopefully my stomach will behave. We are planning to eat at Mojo's and have ordered a shuttle to our hiking spot for 8 am. It is supposed to rain all day. Today's delight. Butterflies everywhere Today's opportunity for learning.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529785,"April 22nd. I called my mama and cried. For the third day in a row my stomach was bothering me. I wanted chicken soup with the small circle noodles and home made broth. I wanted a soft blanket on the couch with an excellent movie line up for the day. What I got was 12 miles of hiking in a cold rain. She was wondering if I was done hiking. No, just wishing for option #1. Could they please send my summer gear.I didn't dress right either. I had shorts and a wool tshirt. It began by misting so I thought I would be too hot In a rain coat. I used it like a poncho. It kept my head dry and rivulets off my neck and back but by the time it was raining harder I was soaked through. I had seal skin waterproof socks but by the end of the day they were wet inside and out. I was never cold, but never warm either. My rationale was the more clothes I got out the more that would be wet. I was probably right about that. Nothing dried overnight. We hiked along and there was some pleasantness in the wet forest. Towards the end of our hike I was hoping we were close to the shelter, but we passed someone who said 2 more miles. I was disappointed, Bombadil went ahead. When I was alone in the quiet everything seemed so peaceful. The shelter was high elevation. The top of Mt. Rogers. The mountain top is open fields with brambles. The shelter holds 14. Bombadil wanted the top, but I couldn't get up the ladder with my pack so I chose the bottom. We were nearly full by the end of the evening. 3 girls came by trying to decide if they would stay with their 2 dogs. They moved on chancing the possibility of further rain storms which it did. Hard, hard rain and thunder on the mountain top. Bombadil had already switched to summer gear. He had walked in the rain with no protection. He had a terrible time warming up and was shivering into the night. I offered to zip our bags together but he never likes that. He ended up sleeping until 7:45 am. A real first for him.Today's delight. A warm sleeping bag.Today's opportunity for learning. Mama's voice and kisses, even over the phone, are filled with special healing magic.","damascus

I was thankful for the rain, may it douse the fires spreading along the trail Franklin, Hot Springs, Watauga, Shenandoah. May the rain fill the springs so thirst may be quenched. May the rain fill every ocean and the moon the earth. May your heart kindle my heart. Talking with cold snap I found that she has a similar problem with town food. She is a very slight women who has lost 12 pounds. Going to town means replenishing needed calories, but it leaves us both with an ache in our stomachs. This has happened to me three times, this last time the worst. Bombadil says order salad, but I think that misses the point. Still don't know what to do about that.We woke up to 40'. Nothing had dried and it was still threatening to rain. I was pretty sure I was not interested in putting on any of my wet clothes. I opted for my warmer outfit of long pants and my long sleeve sun shirt. I did not want my wool night clothes to get wet from rain or sweat these need to stay dry and warm no matter what. I also wore full rain gear zipped to the chin. Bombadil had a rough night so I got water and made tortillas with Nutella and peanut butter instead of our usual oats. Once he was out of he sack and packed he made us some tea. This was our latest start ever from camp at 10:45 just after rainy and trip a couple section hiking from TN.Our hike today was in the Grayson highlands which is famous for wild ponies. We saw the adorable creatures all day long. They stand about chest high and are completely unconcerned with passers by. Per regulations no petting and no feeding. This is hard to resist due to their cuteness. The cloud that hung on us all day long never let loose, just gray skies and fog. Some say this is the prettiest part of the trail, but we got no views on our two days hiking through the area but the rock formations and the fog made the close view stunning and eerie. The hiking was fantastic. It is a park with many loop trails. We were there Saturday and Sunday so there were people from Indiana and Ohio and elsewhere just out for the weekend a 12 hour or more drive from their home. The trail was a very easy grade with some rock hopping and some flat grassy meadows. This was one of our easiest hiking days of about 12 miles. We experienced deja vu when we passed many of the same people on their loop trails.While we were in the park we passed out 500th mile!! Yea us!!After the park we came to a farm area. We had to cross a closed pen area that had several cows with horns. I was actually pretty nervous about the horns. I'm still pretty slow if they got excited I would be helpless. My only defense was to walk behind posts and a large sign. I tried not to look at the beasts and be nonchalant as I passed by. I made it. The cattle did not make any moves other than chewing their cud. I thought at this point we were passed threat of rain. I took off my rain gear finally at 2 pm. We had 31/2 miles to get to the shelter for the night. The last 2 miles I hiked with Rainy and Trip which helped the miles pass by as we shared our stories. I got there about 4 pm. Bombadil had gone ahead. We got the last 2 spots into the 6 person shelter and a fire was already going. The sky had finally cleared to blue and at 4000 feet we were much warmer than the previous night.Today's delight. PoniesToday's opportunity for learning.

We slept well in our little shelter despite 2 people telling me this is the shelter the true story murder on the Appalachian trail was written about. Did you hear part 2 he did it again., stole a car crashed it into a tree and died. All dinner time chatter. We shared the table with Go who will turn 70 on the trail, diesel and cold snap from the north shore , a couple from Indiana out for the weekend , 2 biking enthusiasts one of which had hiking experience the other Steve, first time hiking was very curious about our hiking. I tried to keep the fire going, but it was a feeble thing. As grass is always greener I saw a better fire at a tent site. It was Rainy and Trip. Bombadil and I went to visit them for a while before bed. We talked about gear and things that were working for us. They plan of changing sleeping bags and liked our phone charger.The morning was cool. I saved my nearly dry clothes to change into last minute and finished packing as quickly as possible. We were on the trail at 8 am. We hiked the first 3 miles together. I wanted to take a long break in the sunshine and write, Bombadil did not. I sent him ahead 10 miles to timpi shelter where we would stay tonight. I spent 45 minutes at my leisure enjoying my creek side prop. I had second breakfast and applied sunscreen. Off I went. The morning was still beautiful with birds singing more merrily than I had heard yet on the trail. The sky was clear and blue. The temperature was perfect and warming. The first 5 miles were filled with streams and waterfalls. The second 5 miles were dry and a little hot. My feet began to tire. I began to tire. I slowed. 4 miles to the shelter. 2 miles up, 2 miles down. People from the previous shelter began to pass me. I met bright bags and secret agent. Stitch who I had met in Damascus passed. Finally I arrived. I had not had enough to drink. Bombadil was set up with water so I started with rehydration. Change clothes and take off boots. Hang up sweaty things. I really didn't feel that great. Bombadil wanted me to eat dinner but I had no appetite. I did have 2 peanut butter / Nutella wraps and the last of the cheese we had brought. Then I laid down. After Bombadil ate he made me an electrolyte drink hoping to perk me up. Today's delight. Merrily chirping birdsToday's opportunity for learning. Stay hydrated.","orchard shelter

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530156,"April 25th. Trimpi shelter was pretty neat. I love the stone shelters!! It had a fire place and Bombadil had a fire for us during the night and in the morning. We had the shelter to ourselves. I didn't partake much in the evening chatter. But later when Nikke and Kaio were setting out for a moonlight hike I was very curious. They set out at 9 at night after hiking all day. They didn't really have a plan, they just wanted to go further. The next day was possibly very hot so they wanted cooler miles. We were the last out of camp about 8 am. My morning was good. I had some energy and speed until about noon. We passed a farmers feild that was blooming with tiny yellow flowers. We passed trail magic early in the day. I was a bag of fruit and slim jims. So perfect!! We both had a handful of grapes and an apple and of course slim jims. We were passed by Sunray and chriscross but we then passed them at a water stop. When we crossed the road there was a couple doing a day hike. Trial and Error had done many of the Appalachian trail miles and hoped to through hike after retirement. They had done many section hikes including in the white mountains for their honeymoon hike. Even section hikers know how wonderful trail magic is so they offered to help us any way possible. At first we didn't think we needed anything, but then Bombadil saw an opportunity to hike 22 miles and have me get a ride to the hotel. At the 10 mile mark was the mount Rogers visitor center. They would meet me there. Bombadil went ahead as soon as arrangements were made. He planned on leaving heavy items for me to shuttle at the visitors center. I was slower than trail and error since she was under dr. Orders not to lift anything. When I arrived at the center Secret agent handed me a sock. Bombadil forgot a sock. Secret agent, stitch, bevo and bright bags had just finished their pizza delivered from town. Evidently Bombadil had scored a piece. I was not so lucky. They watched me and tried to figure what I was about. .. You're getting a ride?? To the hotel?? The one in Atkins??? The rest inn?? You're taking Bombadil's stuff?? Bevo was the first to put all the pieces together and ask for a bit of this trail magic. Can you take my bag?? Stitch was next , and mine?? Secret agent and bright bags were more reluctant to release all their belongings needed to survive for 6 months in the woods into the unknown. I had only met them last night. But the trail is magic. In the end I had 5 bags to put In Trail and error 's car. They were delighted to help so many people. Bright bags was being a purest and carried his bag 22 miles in the heat that day.Trail and error took me all about town on errands. I went to Walmart for some real food. I bought strawberries and bananas, apples and oranges. Cheerios milk and chocolate milk. My long underwear has holes from the briar patch on beauty spot I want to sew them with gold berries, I bought thread. They took me to Pizza Hut and I got salad and a pizza each for Bombadil and I. Then I was dropped off with all those back packs. Hugs and phone numbers exchanged I hope to help them when they section Massachusetts.Today's delight.

""What are you watching??"" Not my typical viewing option. ""Couldn't you find lifetime??"" I ate most of my pizza and half the salad. I was grazing through yogurt and strawberries.   When the other hikers arrived they were thankful for the pack delivery and bright bags who carried his pack all day kept up with the slack packers. I shared the apples and oranges with them. I was hoping with this great nutritional boost I would have more energy. We were racing the rain that was predicted for 3 pm.

As we sat at our leisure through the evening we hailed everyone that passed by. Many of our hiking friends from the start passed by as we directed traffic and let everyone know who had passed and what their plans were. Some also stayed to visit for a while. At the end of the evening there were 4 of us that stayed at the shelter. Milkman stayed in his hammock and candy man shared the shelter with Bombadil and I. It rained during the night. And there were some unusual sounds during the night as well. I was not able to identify the loud hollow knocking sound that echoed a single knock at long intervals.By morning the rain had stopped. We had a relaxing morning as we drank our tea and ate our breakfast. We were packed and on our way at8:15. The first bit was downhill, but we were in for a long day of climbing. Due to the rain it was also very hot and humid. We passed the campsite that most people had stayed at at 9:00. Everyone except storyteller had moved on. We hiked with old hiker most of the day. We met stone a missionary on the trail and storyteller we passed every time he stopped for a ""bowl"" which was often. The next shelter was 9.4 miles ahead. Bombadil hoped we would go further but with so much climbing and the nice shelter at hand and frequent deluging rains surrounding the area we decided to stay. Chestnut knob shelter is a one room stone building. It even has a door such luxury. The indoor fireplace is sealed, but Bombadil is working on an outdoor fire now. The roof is secured with half inch wide cables run through the stone walls. I'm thinking it must be windy atop this hill. 4400 feet. The view from the shelter is of a sunken limestone garden surrounded by high ridges.Today's delight. A perfectly blooming dogwood tree. A perfect rock to sit on for lunch. A perfect fire at the end of the day.Today's opportunity for learning. As I was hiking I was thinking what do I still need to get better at.

It was roaring with glowing embers for hours providing warmth and pleasure all evening and into the night. Our night in chestnut knob shelter could have been better. The last bunk was filled by señor snore aka wild card. OMG we were all awake from 11:30 until 2 am. Sunray did not fall asleep until 4 am. The rafters rattled with snoring and thunder the tin roof clattering with rain . At one point I asked Bombadil if we should do night hiking. Sunray asked crisscross if they could tent. We all took a break outside and could see thunderstorms in all directions. Back inside with earplugs which helped immensely.The morning couldn't have been better. This was my very favorite day of hiking yet. There had been a prediction of 70% rain for the day. The morning clouds sat in the valley and we walked above the clouds with the sunlight shining. The air was perfect the path even at the top of the mountain was verdant. Spring had made it got the mountain tops. The hike was beautiful and pretty easy. We stayed on the ridge all day. To our left was the limestone crater garden with farmland capturing the sun and the right was rolling blue hills. The ridge was filled with crags of limestone jutting up from the path. The path itself was easy to traverse. At 10 miles we made it to a shelter and had a very nice break. We both took our boots off and had lunch. I was so comfy I asked if Bombadil wouldn't mind if I had a short nap. He was okay with that since our nights sleep was so bad and I thought I could hike 5 more miles after. Bombadil also rested and took care of his feet. I was a little stiff when I got up, but the next 5 miles were just as nice. The 15 mile mark was a road with tent sites on either side and a river with a beautiful footbridge. We crossed the road and set up. The site we picked had a new picnic table and several good tent sites. We set up the tent and made dinner. After we got water and washed up a bit in the river. Hot cocoa and Oreo cookies sent from my parents were a nice end to the day. We had just finished getting ready for bed when it began to sprinkle rain drops. Everything was set so we dove into the tent. This was the only rain we got for the day.Today's delight. Walking above the clouds until they were ready to ascend.

The weather was perfect the breeze constant and cooling. At the 10 mile mark as it was starting to get warmer than was comfortable was the next shelter. I had hoped to stop for lunch, but Bombadil really didn't want to. It was far off the trail and water was even farther. He did break the bad news at that time. We either stopped here at noon with plenty of energy left in our legs short of our 13 mile allotment for the day or hiked another 10 miles to the next water source.Making the choice wasn't that hard, but I wasn't happy about it. The terrain was easy. The day was beautiful. I just was not excited about the prospect of a 20 mile day (Bombadil after 48 days of rounding will deny 20 miles and say 19.8). The up side was we were headed to dismal falls and a gas station with grilled lunch options. Tomorrow we would have a short hiking day with food and swimming. We decided we had enough water and kept hiking. After a bit we came to a nice log for lunch time. We sat and ate while doing some stretches to prepare for the long haul. The terrain remained manageable. The breeze kept blowing. We passed the 600 mile mark and arrived at the shelter at 5:30pm. I was very tired so I didn't sit down. I immediately went for water. I sat by the waters edge soaking my swollen feet while getting 5 liters of water with the sawyer squeeze. The water source was a spring. It came out if the rocks and formed 6 small cascading pools then went back into the earth. The water seemed a little low. It appeared as though it usually ran along the hill side for a while, but beyond the pools were only dry leaves. El tehano came down the hill to fill his water and soak his feet. He said he takes ibuprofen during the day for his aching feet but the cold water soothes the swelling enough for night time. I would take some tonight to assure discomfort would not keep me awake.At camp were some new faces. Optimistic dreamer is writing a book, "" my suicide note."" He had attempted suicide on a blue blaze trail in the white mountains. He was saved by a through hiker. When released from the hospital he started a southbound journey with $167 in his pocket and is now a yoyo hiker hiking north. He hikes with learning curve. Learning curve, well the name is self explanatory. He stays with od to stay out of trouble as much as possible, but he is very sweet. Farmer had hiked 24 miles to reach water that day.

Morning was pleasant and we had plenty of water to cook and start hiking. We were last out of camp at 8:00. We were both excited about the day's plan. Our 8 miles to Trent 's gas station went quickly. Food!! Bombadil ordered for us. We ate a slice of pizza that we shared while waiting for bacon cheeseburger and fries. Food is so good when you are hungry. I had a second burger. We also took some food to go. There was a 30% chance of rain in the morning. It was overcast. The afternoon was 50% chance of rain. With the weather being so inaccurate previous days I was hoping... But no. It started raining. It stayed raining. We went to the falls anyway. Dismal falls was very pretty and a nice swimming hole. We met doc who we had not seen for weeks and red bear. They had built a fire and left us in charge of it while they went for beer back at Trent's. Bombadil and I went swimming and washed I the stream. Warming by the fire we added logs to get warm. It was still raining. Bombadil became more and more anxious to leave. I was remembering that I had hiked 20 miles for this easy day and resisted. By 3:30 we were on our way. We hiked 6 miles to wapiti shelter. Correction for earlier post. This is were crazy murder and mayhem happened. A local sitting outside of Trent 's place gave an account of the story including local details such as it was my girlfriend 's son that got shot the second time. There couldn't be an easier 6 miles. It was flat, straight, soft forest floor. We arrived at the shelter at 7pm. I hiked ahead of Bombadil most of the way, but I took the wrong blue blaze trail. I checked it out but decided it was a horse trail and kept hiking. During that time he passed me. I had hoped to reconnect because I didn't know exactly where I was so I waited. I eventually figured he had passed me and kept hiking. I was a little nervous thinking if I missed I had 10 more miles until the next shelter and it was only 2 hours until nightfall, but everything worked out fine.

We walked through rivulets in the trail for most of those 8 miles. When we got to woods hole hostel the rain broke and it was sunny the rest of the afternoon. The hostel once inside is a wonderful paradise. Trying to get in is difficult. Every entrance was blocked by a fence with no direction for entry. Stepping over the fence we were warmly welcomed and given the the tour and lowdown on how our stay would be. We signed up for dinner and laundry. We ordered homemade bread and a block of cheese to tide us over until dinner. The bread was heavenly and satisfying. We stayed in Tilly's room. Woods hole hostel has 3 indoor rooms and a bunkhouse. They offer massage. How could I resist. It was wonderful. The first song on her play list was Sawaswati's mantra. The massage was deep tissue with use of multiple essential oils, hot towels and range of motion. Nevill asked if I had trouble spots. I reported my neck and shoulders from my pack and my feet. With my heavy pack I tend to lead with my chin. I constantly remind myself to improve my posture and don't pull with my head, but it's hard. She gave me a whole body massage focusing on my shoulders. By the end of the hour she had worked her magic and my shoulders loosened.Dinner was mountain gumbo and an organic salad with more home made bread. I loved the salad and bread but the gumbo was too heavy for me. I gave most of mine to Bombadil. He seemed to like it. It was filled with farm bacon and pepperoni. We also had home made ice cream for dessert. We are outside. Holding hand we had a moment of silence and an introduction circle before sitting around the fire pit to eat.Evening was helping to clean up, then quiet. I read Flowers of the Appalachian Trail. It was a wonderful book dedicating 2 pages to each flower on the trail. The left was a written description with botanical info as well as folklore. The right was a full page photo. The book answered so many questions. Now I have to remember all this newfound knowledge.Today's delight. Woods hole hostel.Today's opportunity for learning. Sometimes you have to walk through mud.","wapiti shelter

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531305,"May 2nd. Tilly's room is a lovely place to sleep. During the night was a ferocious thunder storm. The fire alarm in the house went off every time it thundered. One might think this was annoying, but it was no louder than the thunder and quieted promptly. Bombadil and I had some planning to do. My parents were coming to visit today. How would we meet them?. Bombadil wanted to hike and we had an opportunity to slack pack if we could figure it out. In the end I decided to stay at the hostel for the day and wait for my parents. They would have more trouble looking in the woods for both of us and I knew where I was at the moment. We have terrible phone service so I didn't want to risk not being able to contact them. Bombadil picked a 15 mile hike and would try to get to town after via hitch hiking and wait for us there.First we had breakfast. It was amazing. Homemade cinnabuns with drippy icing, farm eggs, farm sausage, fresh oranges. Home made bread, orange juice, fresh roasted coffee or tea. I hope I didn't leave anything out. I don't know how we got so lucky. I thought maybe they did this everyday, but I later heard the next day would be just fruit and bread. After breakfast Bombadil headed out. I was in for a day of relaxation on the beautiful organic farm. I could choose the swing on the porch overlooking a wonderful view or the hammock at the bunkhouse with the same mountain pasture scene. I chose the hammock. While it in the hammock I visited with blackbear from Maine. He was waiting to make a call to a 5th grade class to answer all their questions about the Appalachian trail. A friend was their teacher and had asked if he would correspond. I sat with spongebob from Hawaii . We were both absorbed in our books. From my perch I could see the new folks for the day arriving. I tried to point in the right direction, but the doors are all completely blocked off. It's just confusing to get in. Today Portugal came by. He was happy to see me (because he is always happy).. He had come down the trail to see the hostel and take photos for his writing. Magic man arrived. I had assumed he was way ahead since he can do fast big miles, but he had been off the trail a couple days.My parents arrived at 3 pm as planned. The only trouble they had finding the place was missing the sing at the end of the driveway. They ended up on the forest service road which was a little bumpy for their Subaru. But they found me. I had been waiting for them to arrive to try the hostels smoothies. I hadn't had lunch yet so I thought we would snack on the left over cheese and bread. The smoothies served in a quart ball jar were filled with blueberries and homemade ice cream. Sooo yummy. We left to find Bombadil. By the time we got down the hill into town we had service and no trouble finding him. He had not had luck hitchhiking but he had walked most of the way back into town. He had on a new straw hat. I wanted to hear that story. While crossing a long bridge he could see hard rain tracking towards him. He raced to the end of the bridge and dove into the first door he could find, a feed store. He waited out the storm in the shop and found himself a new straw hat.All piled in we went to Blacksburg for a hotel room at Comfort Inn and had Mexican food for dinner. We talked for hours over margaritas and wine.Today's delight. My parents driving 800 miles to visit meToday's opportunity for learning. Farm fresh and homemade can't be beat.","woods hole hostel

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531306,"May 3rd. I couldn't sleep. Mexican food most likely the culprit. Bombadil and I were to meet my parents at 6:45 for hotel free breakfast. I was a little sluggish so we were late. Bombadil and I both like the Belgian waffles that are served at hotel buffets.After breakfast we headed back to the trail to drop off Bombadil. He will keep hiking while the three of us go visit verge and legs. The side road we went down had a downed tree that had just been cleared and the signs and cars were covered with leaves. Bombadil called us after to tell us a terrible hail storm had come through the area. On the trail there had been 5 inches of hail and tents had been destroyed. We lost service before we could get any more news. Of course I am concerned and worried about our fellow travelers. I hope it wasn't as bad as we imagined and every one is safe.We still hadn't made a very good plan with legs and verge. Contacting someone when both parties have terrible phone coverage is difficult. Eventually legs called me and I did have service and plans took shape. Still we had to have some faith that we would cross paths. It was about a 3 hour drive to the Mount Rogers area. Since we would be sitting on the trail I suggested we bring some trail magic. Stopping at a grocery store we got apples and oranges for any hikers who passed while we waited. Everything worked according to plan. We found the designated spot. We parked. Hikers came. They knew legs and verge and would be here within the hour. Perfect!! Icing on the cake, we met sweets, jingle and training wheels all who had been hiking with legs and verge for weeks. They stayed to visit for a bit before moving on. Then they appear!!!So happy to see them they are now smothered with hugs and kisses. We feed them apples and oranges, chips and cheese curls. In the car we try to devise a plan. We decide to drive to cabela's for any needed supplies, Olive Garden for lunch and hotel for showers and rest. In the evening we played rummycube a new game for me which I soundly lost.Today's delight. Seeing my babes.Today's opportunity for learning. Home is where the heart is.","blacksburg

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531599,"May 4th. Legs, Verge and I were to meet the grandparents for breakfast at 7 am. Free hotel breakfast was Belgian waffles again with yogurt. The plan for the day was a reverse slack pack from the mount Rogers park to rt 58 where we picked up Legs and Verge the previous day. The access point had a 1 mile Appalachian spur trail blue blaze that would get us to the trail and also easy access for the grandparents to visit the feral ponies near the Balds of mount Rogers. That would be about 15 miles for them and 2 miles for us.The plan was perfect. We found the parking area and hiked up the hill. As grandparents looked around impressed with the view and taking pictures we rounded the corner and saw our first ponies. Did I say cute? So cute. I walked around the next corner and there were 5 right on the trail. They were aloof and munching on grass. 2 of them were scratching each other's neck with their teeth. Two of them pranced over to visit. They were mildly looking for food. Notices state not to feed the ponies as this makes them aggressive nudges. We did not feed or pet them, but we couldn't resist taking selfies with our visitors. After our amusements we sent the girls on their hike with promises to pick them up. We then drove to Damascus for lunch. We had not yet been on that stretch of road. It wasn't fun for anyone. The descent into Damascus is steep and winding. I was driving. I had complaints that I was driving too quickly, but the car was in 3rd gear and my foot was still on the brake the whole way down the hill. 17 miles of winding road. After a breath of fresh air we had lunch at Mojo's. All three of us enjoyed our relaxing lunch. We walked the creeper trail around town with me showing off the sites of this one road town and pointing out where I had stayed 2 weeks ago.The girls are speedy on the trail with their packs. Without them those two made good time. We picked them up at the arranged time. My parents took a stroll into the woods to meet them finding a grove filled with lady slippers. We decided to stay 2 nights in Marion. We would return to mount Rogers in the morning to drop the girls off for a northward slack pack journey. Rummycube, I'm improving.Today's delight. Every second with my family.Today's opportunity for learning. Get gasoline before you enter the wilderness.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531949,"May 5th. Another great day with the family. We had our free hotel breakfast of Belgian waffles. The girls Legs and Verge had very lofty plans to hike 25 miles today. Mom and I left the hotel at 8:00 for the hour drive them back to the highlands. On their way at 9:15 the girls didn't hike with us today, they had to get going. They were out of site in moments. Mom and I were hoping to see the ponies again today. We found a loop trail to take us up to the Balds and around back to the car. We went up the spur trail, south on the AT and back via massie gap. We were not so lucky seeing the ponies today. We only saw two at a very far distance. I don't really know pony habits, but it was early. Maybe they were sleeping in. Also, the weather was cold. Maybe they were all huddled together in some gap. We enjoyed our outing. The Balds were beautiful, the views just as pretty as the day before. Then the hour drive back to the hotel just in time for lunch. We picked up my dad and went to Appletree country cooking. We had planned on visiting some parks or antique shops, but all three of us were ready for down time and just relaxed for the afternoon until it was time to collect the girls. Dad and I drove to the pick up spot. I had the road name, but we had to just keep a lookout for the AT crossing. It was at the far end of a long road. The girls had hiked in a cold rain for hours. We brought them dry cloths, snacks and water to get them back to the hotel for their hot showers. I gathered all the laundry and ran out to do a load while they warmed up in the shower. We ordered takeout pizza, calzones and subway to facilitate earlier bedtime and still playing rummycube. Dad couldn't let Legs win again so he conspired against her. Today's delight. Enjoying Mt. Rogers walking with my mom.Today's opportunity for learning. Legs likes eating healthy so she got subway veggie sub to go with her bags of chips and pint of ice cream. A hot veggie calzone would be unhealthy.","marion

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531966,"May 6th. Well, today we would have to say goodbye. We planned a lazy morning. Legs and Verge slept in and had to pack their bags for hiking. We had hotel breakfast but the girls got their own breakfast out of their backpacks preferring that to hotel breakfast. After we were ready to head out we had more rounds of rummycube. Legs won again. She is the overall champion. We stalled long enough to go out to lunch. We went back to Appletree country cooking for all day breakfast.Back to the trail. The girls were smothered with kisses and hugs from all of us. I was given my Mother's Day card early from my thoughtful daughters. Smiling they skipped off on their adventures. Happy for their smiling faces my heart was heavy watching them walk away.We drove north 3 hours to connect with Bombadil. We had no difficulty finding him. He was waiting for us at the trail side. He had stopped at 4 pines hostel in the morning to do laundry. We also had a drop box at the hostel so we went back to the hostel to pick it up. We met the friendly giant Joe Mitchell hostel proprietor and toured the grounds. Bombadil had a broken pole so we went to the town of Daleville where there would be an outfitter who could repair the pole. The four of us checked into Howard Johnson hotel then out to 3 pigs for bbq. I had the best meal of the week at this place. It was a special they had for the day of chicken breast caprese. The food was fresh and well cooked.After we were all fed and Bombadil's pole fixed we returned to our room to teach Bombadil rummycube. Today's delight.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533090,"May 7th. It was the best of times it was the worst of times. I don't quite know how to write about today. More goodbyes. Harder even then the last. Everyone got going early. My parents were ready to return home so there would be no slack packing for us. We got let off at the trail where we had found Bombadil the day before. I was hugged so deeply and warmly as only a parent can hug. I was offered one last opportunity to drive home yet encouraged to continue as their pride for me was clear that I had done so well on my journey. Bombadil later asked what my percentage was. One foot on the trail and one foot headed home it was a 49/51 split. The trail winning by a very narrow margin.Bombadil's chore while I was away was to attack the trail with big miles to offer me some relief. While for the most part he did his job I was spared many unpleasantries my week off the trail. I missed terrible rains and cold. I missed hale storms that ravaged people's tents. I missed dragon's tooth a very challenging part of the trail even in good weather. Bombadil did 14-20 mile days. But the first words out of his mouth were, ""let's do a 20 mile slack pack."". My heart sank. I was not yet ready to pick up my heavy pack and this would bring us right back to the hotel. But I had new shoes, I hadn't slept well all week and I just didn't feel very strong. I agreed. The beginning of our hike was wonderful. We were headed straight for mcafee knob a highlight of the trail. It was a stunning outcropping rock with lovely verdant views of the expansive rolling hills of Virginia. We stayed for the obligatory photo shoot and a short time to just enjoy the view. The weather was perfect with fair weather clouds a light breeze and smells of spring flowers reaching our nose. We continued to Tinker cliffs. And equally beautiful cliff edge we walked along for almost a mile with just as stunning sights to see. At the 10 mile mark we stopped at a shelter for water. At the hotel I had asked Bombadil to bring the filter. He said he had aqua Mira. I did not realize this was a refusal. At the shelter I reminded him to use the filter, but he didn't have it. I was perturbed. I had been complaining for weeks I thought aqua Mira upset my stomach, had he not heard, read, listened?? An hour later as the day was warming I asked for a water break. I quickly drank half a liter of water to quench my thirst. A moment later I said, "" OMG, I'm going to thow up."" The feeling passed, but I was worried about the next 8 miles. Bombadil asked if it was psychological, cuz it doesn't bother him at all.As we went on and I became more tired, my feet more swollen, my thirst unslaked, my heart still sad from goodbyes, things went downhill. At 17 miles my limit had been met with three miles to go. Waterworks as rarely seen from Goldberry were on full force. The percentage changed. Why hadn't I gotten in the car. Why did Bombadil poison me. Various other irrational things were said. We just hiked 3 more miles. We got back to the hotel. We ate lots of food. We went to bed. Things would be better in the morning.Today's delight. Mcafee knob. I am so thankful for everything my parents have done for me. I am so thankful they came to see me and my family. I am so thankful for their warm and loving hugs even though it makes it hard to keep going.Today's opportunity for learning. Do not agree to hike 20 miles. You do not like hiking 20 miles. Goodbyes waken ones resilience.Ps. Please leave positive encouraging comments only.","daleville

I was still cross about how the previous day had gone. The good news is no blisters with 20 miles in my new shoes. I did feel like my feet were more tired in my trail running shoes rather than my boots. But how can I measure that. My Mother's Day was spent in quiet with the tv remote. I took a walk to Kroger's and bought fresh fruit an apple, strawberries, cherries, banana and avocado . I bought Cheerios and milk. I bought wine and crackers and cheese. I was set for a day of good nutrition and grazing. I had to walk back to the hotel with 6 bags of groceries.Bombadil returned at 5 pm from his hike. I fed him some wine and cheese. Later he walked across the street for chicken nuggets from Pizza Hut. We had a ride at 7 am to our drop off spot. I decided to pack in the morning, but Bombadil stayed up until 11:30 packing his bag. I got a Mother's Day phone call for all three of my children and called my own mother. My parents were still making their way home, but all was well. Today's delight.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533092,"May 9th. We had a 2 mile approach to the trail today and planned a 15 mile hike. We were shuttled by Homer's wife Theresa. Both had hiked the AT with their family 15 years ago and they have maintained a section of trail since the 70's. The approach was 2 miles uphill. The air was thick and humid. Moisture was pilling on every hair. At the top of the hill we finally made it to the AT. A section hiker was also resting there. We leap frogged all day with him. And he was one of the very few people we saw that day.We were walking along the Blue Ridge Parkway. Apparently, the parkway was the original AT but was usurped by the ministry of the interior for a road. The road happened to be closed to traffic for repaving, if cars had been zipping by all day it would have detracted from the experience. Today was my first bear encounter. It was less scary than I anticipated. We just looked at each other from 30 yards away. The mother and baby were not inclined to move until I started shouting, ""Hey, hey."" Then the mother scampered off first. The baby still curious stayed to look a few seconds longer before running away.My new shoes were not giving me blisters, but my feet were very tired. I hiked with Bombadil until he stomped off saying he couldn't hike so slowly any longer. He would meet me 6 miles ahead and set up the tent. We had decided on Jennings creek. It was supposed to be a good swimming hole, but I was pretty sure that wouldn't happen. It would be late, I would be tired, it would rain. Aside from my feet hurting I did ok. I arrived at camp at the predicted time, which meant I hadn't hiked all that slowly after all. The tent was up and I was able to climb inside right as it began to sprinkle.We waited for a break in the rain to cook dinner and get water. Warning to future hikers. There is so much poison ivy here. You can barely take a footstep without worry.Today's delight. My wild thyme turkey dinner was yummyToday's opportunity for learning.

It was still sprinkling off and on. Bombadil was all packed before I even started. So he did the natural thing. He stood over me with his arms crossed. Goldberry, let's get going. We were hiking by 8:30.I had purchased some carnation instant breakfast and prepared it the night before. I added instant milk and hot chocolate mix. I have decided to continue doing this. It's good and filling. We had a lot of incline for the day starting right away. The day was still wet and humid with the same moisture collecting on our arms and eventually soaking our clothing. We stopped and rested at Cornelius creek shelter. Trooper, who dat, ish, and stone had all stopped for lunch. Our intention was to stay just for a lunch break but the weather was looking ominous and everyone we had met was headed for the next shelter. It was sure to be full. We decided to take the first 2 spots in our current situation and wait out the weather. For me it was a nice break to have an 8 mile day.Because we had stopped early we had time to build a fire, throw a bear bag and set up before anyone else arrived. By the end of the night we had 6 in our shelter, full, but no one else arrived. We were joined by caboose, and sweeper a father daughter pair, Spielberg named for his daily video blogs, and seabiscuit a Belgian who had been with caboose and sweeper from the start. By 6 o'clock it was raining. We all tried to finish eating, cooking and cleaning up before getting wet. It was a quiet early evening for all of us.Today's delight.

The weather forecast was still for rain all day. Morning was lovely and pink with haze surrounding us even this early. We stayed dry through breakfast then got going at 8:30. We were the last ones out. On the trail we met sparky, freight train and Hong Kong Steve. They have been reverse slack packing for weeks and occasionally cross our path during the day. It was another humid morning with our skin glistening. Was it raining or were we just standing in a cloud? I had prepared for rain. My backpack was covered and my raincoat tied to the top covering my hair.We did some early morning climbing again. This brought us some relief above the clouds. The sky was blue the air was cool and fresh. We took a break at thunder mountain shelter. The next shelter was 12 miles away. Bombadil wanted us to make it to the next shelter. We would descend back into the clouds for hot and humid weather. Towards the end of the day 3 miles from the shelter we got stuck in a thunderstorm. This quickened our pace so that we arrived ahead of schedule just as the rain stopped. My first chore was water. The stream was rushing and full after the storm. I couldn't resist dunking in for a refreshing cleanse. Food bag was with me. She had thought of just splashing clean but I encountered a plunge. We were both pleased with the decision. The water was warm enough and felt so good as to leave my skin tingling for an hour.Today's delight. The plunge in a fresh rushing stream.

That got the rest of us started. We were headed for the tiny town of Glasgow Virginia. We had 2 miles to hike to the longest foot bridge on the trail and 5 miles to hitchhike into town. We just got packed and skipped breakfast hoping for better food in town. Bombadil scored us a ride almost immediately. He went to a crossroad and asked directions from someone at a stop sign. He was about to say sorry I'm going the other way when he decided he would just help us out. He had been out hunting turkeys in his truck. He passed 4 of our friends chompa, get weird, Spider-Man, food bag, and he let them in the back making 6 happy hikers. We saw familiar faces and Bombadil got the lay of the land. We headed first to laundry. Glasgow is unique as they have created a hiker pavilion area with showers, portapottys, running water, hot water, and electricity with a shelter, picnic table and fire ring. After the laundry was going I showered and visited farmer, Aristotle, teatime, 2 socks, trooper, and spike at the shelter while Bombadil manned the laundry. He also must have gone to the post office. When I checked on him he had 2 resupply boxes. One from us as expected and a gift from the Winchendon school filled with perfect yummy treats for hikers. Thank you Winchendon school. Homemade cookies were shared and appreciated by all the hikers. Jerky, gorp and nutritious bars to sustain us on our long hikes all welcome treats.There were no breakfast places in this tiny tiny town. The only restaurant opens at 10:30. We went there at 11:00 with hiker friends. 2 socks, Ish, and shaggy (the one with cool dad and Moonboots). We enjoyed our meals. I had a bacon cheeseburger that was very satisfying.I was very unmotivated to come up with a plan. Bombadil liked it here in Glasgow also so he arranged for a reverse slack pack from punchbowl gap back to Glasgow. I really like reverse slack packing because you can see all the people that are hiking near you. Oriel, teatime, sweet potato, conundrum, Chyna/ Aurora, el tehano, bug stick and many new faces and new names kiwi and Virginia creeper.The hike and day was similar to the previous 3 days. We were in a cloud. It was humid and muggy. We began uphill for several miles then mostly downhill the rest of the afternoon. We hiked 12:30-6 pm. We hitchhiker back again to the shelter and ate at scotto's for dinner.Today's delight.

For the most part the day was uneventful. We hiked some with Farmer who we had seen intermittently over the last 2 weeks. As we were talking about our girls he remembered that he started his hike with them. We were happy to find another person who had met the girls Legs and Verge on the trail.

A pile of fresh scrambled eggs with cheese and plenty of pepper, Yogurt with blueberries and granola, crispy bacon, bagels dripping with butter. We loved it at three springs so we looked into slack packing options. My resolve to not hike 20 miles was intact. Oma and I looked at pick up and drop off spots and found a hike 19.1 miles. The map looked like it would be mostly a ridge with a 4.5 mile steep descent at the end. We got to the trail at 8:30. It was a beautiful cool day. Being a Saturday many families and weekenders were out on The Priest the areas largest mountain. The feild near the parking area had 10 tents, one large extended family out camping together. The ridge had high green canopy with low green vegetation. The terrain was moderate the whole hike, except the downhill. 4.5 miles with 3000 ft down is somewhat steep. Our hostess had scared us a little about how hard it would be, but even this we managed without to much difficulty. The trail was in very good condition and mostly dirt. The descents that I have trouble with include large boulder steps that hyper flex my tired knees, but there was very little of that.I hiked amazingly fast for me maintaining 2.5 mph all day. This changed our arrival time by an hour and a half. We had cell service at the top of the mountain. We did our best to estimate our pick up time and let them know when to get us. It would be an hour drive. Thunderstorms had been predicted for 1 pm. We had sunny blue skies all morning until that cloud made it over the mountain. We walked in a cold rain for about an hour. We stopped at priest shelter to get water, have a snack and shelter for just a few moments. There were 15 people inside. More than half were weekenders, but we saw a few familiar faces. Matt, black bear, AB, and riser. We only stayed long enough to get water. Everyone else's priority was to stay dry and keep their things dry. We had a warm shower coming and a deadline to catch our ride so we were back at it on the rain.We passed a beautiful stream sparkling in the sun as the rain cleared. I was dry by the time we reached the bottom. Marsha arrived within 15 minutes and we were on our way. I asked for a grocery stop if possible for some fresh fruit and Bombadil wanted steak. Our wish was granted. We went back to the hostel for a wonderful dinner. Today's delight. Doing so well on such a long hikeToday's opportunity for learning.

That suited us just fine and she promised an even grander Sunday morning breakfast. Hugh's net is the internet service available in the deep woods. It has very restricted data usage. If hostels even allow usage it is very limited. We were allotted 6 am-8 am and requested not to download or stream anything. Oma suggested that breakfast be served at 8 am so that we could enjoy our full 2 hours of Internet. She made us crispy bacon, scrambled eggs with lots of gooey cheese and pepper, pumpkin pancakes with butter and syrup. Still the three of us Bombadil, House and I were not in a hurry to leave. We still had packing to do. I had an opportunity to weigh my full pack 33#. 3 more pounds to go.Oma hugged us goodbye and Marsha drove us the hour back to the trail. I had dressed in my usual hiking outfit knowing I would warm up, but my shorts and tshirt were very chilly in the 46' morning. It had been in the 30's overnight. No rain was predicted for the day and it was breezy. Once I got going I was warm enough. We had a lot of climbing planned for the day, but not too many miles. Bombadil stayed with me for a while, but I like breaks and he got cold. I asked if he wasn't going to hike with me if he would please make a fire. It was supposed to in the 30's again tonight.I had a lovely quiet stroll up the hill. I leap frogged with an older gentleman and his son who ended up camping with us that night at the shelter. I never learned their names though. I took the time to call my parents and text some friends as I haven't had good cell service for weeks. On this mountain close to waynesboro I seemed to get good reception. I couldn't stop for long because it was still cool and breezy.I eventually got to the shelter. 3 college kids just done for the year were in the shelter and had helped Bombadil start the fire. The three of them got Bombadil in teaching mode which he stayed in until we left. They and the 2 gentlemen I mentioned were very interested in through hiking specifics. We had fireside discussion on that topic for the duration. The fire was wonderful and warm, but smoky. We all dodged the smoke all night. At one point I joked I got more exercise dancing around the smoke than I did hiking that day. Later in the evening we were joined by sharky just back to the trail after visiting family, teatime who's shoes were totally blown out (one day to late. He was with his parents the day before who I am sure would have sprung for new shoes), an air force couple out for 4 days leave who provided marshmallows, and at dark 4 college kids wondering where the trail was ( we recommended it was time to set up camp).We were in our sleeping bags at 9 pm, quite late for us. The night was cold as predicted. I felt cold, but never shivering. I did sleep off and on, but not well. I tried to stay close to Bombadil which helped some.Today's delight.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533663,"May 16th. Morning came and we were the first ones up. We had a slow morning. There was some nice socializing to be done. We still had embers in the fire. My first priority was to rekindle the flames. The three boys had gone to bed at 6 got up to sit by the fire. They were the first ones packed and out. Sharky, Bombadil and I had breakfast. Air Force girl had offered to make pancakes for us so she showed up. I told her it wasn't necessary, but she made me one. She said she offered so she wanted to make it happen as she is very stubborn. Bombadil was sure to let me know when he was ready to go. I quickly finished getting ready for the day changing and packing. We were off at 8:30. We had planned 16 miles to The Paul Wolfe shelter. The terrain was not overly vigorous, but there were a lot of rocks and rock climbing. I was just thinking my feet were adjusted to running shoes when the rocks came. My feet and knees were very tired by the end of the day.   I loved passing all the springs and babbling brooks throughout the day. I spent some time photographing and videoing some of them. I was at a particularly beautiful spot when I looked up and saw the shelter. It was a welcome relief. My feet were tired. I went up and unpacked. My first priority was to soak my feet in the cold, cold water. Bombadil and Sharky were the only ones at the shelter. We had a relaxed evening. We didn't make a fire. The weather would be at least 10' warmer. We ate dinner and got ready for bed. It was a long day and the night prior was not such a good night sleep. Perhaps tonight would be better. We were close to town in the morning we had a 5 mile hike into town. As I was brushing my teeth a guy comes hiking into camp with 2 pizza boxes. Forreal!! Hans, thruhiker 2013 giving back to the trail, hiked 2 pizzas 5 miles to feed us. We each enjoyed 2 pieces when fisherman and rubrics showed up to eat the rest. We all turned in early.Today's delight. Sparkling babbling brooks.Today's opportunity for learning. What are we gunna do about rocks.","maupin feild shelter

Rain was predicted early. We had hoped to beat the rain but it started to sprinkle right when we started our hike at 6:20 am. Hans was also packed and out by 6:30. I was in front for a while but the cobwebs were really sticking to me, arms, legs and face. It was annoying and Bombadil had full rain gear so he went ahead. Hans also caught up at that time. He and Bombadil talked all the way to the trail head. They were fast and the rain intensified so that we were soaked and bedraggled by then, but for the most part I kept up. Hans drove us to town at 8:30. We tried to get a room at the quality inn, but they would not let us check in with until 12:00. Dripping wet a fellow hiker Matt let us change and keep our packs in his room until then. We then went on a mission to find breakfast. We stumbled onto an amazing tea house. It was warm!! It was so sweetly decorated with wonderful hospitality. We were of course recognized as hikers. We decided on 3 entrees. We would share French toast and each ordered an omelet. The food was divine. I had 2 huge pots of herbal tea. Before we finished eating trail angels came and had their breakfast to. The owner pointed them out to us in case we needed rides. Bombadil went for our mail and brought it back for us to get a ride to the hotel.For the afternoon Bombadil did laundry while I checked out the box sent from a friend filled with trail magic. For dinner we went to Ming Garden all you can eat. It was pretty terrible food. After we went to Kroger's and I got fresh cherries. Today's delight.

He decided on a reverse slack pack of 10 miles leaving an 11 mile hike for the next day. My knees were still quite sore. I was hoping one more day would suffice for recovery. I pretty much hid out in our room most of the day. Much tv watching was done. I soaked in the tub and spent the day grazing on cherries, Cheerios and yogurt. Bombadil was due to return at 3:30. He was hungry immediately upon arrival. I suggested he take shower as it is town etiquette to not walk into a restaurant a stinking hiker, but I guess he was too hungry. We tried a burger joint that was supposed to have the best burgers in town, but we wanted a Guinness. The waitress was very helpful and directed us to where the beer selection was larger. We ended up at the Heritage bar. We loved it there. We liked the music. A Red Sox game was on and the burger and beer was just what we were looking for. Guinness of course was our choice.Today's delight. Eating cherries all day. Today's opportunity for learning. Cherries are diuretic","waynesboro

I finally packed and went through our resupply. Thank you Kathy for the gifts from home. We had to pack for 7 days so our packs were super heavy again. I couldn't actually close the bag. I had to hope after dinner it would close so that it would hang on the bear pole that night.We got dropped off at sawmill gap. We had a very lovely day. Our start near 11 am on the trail was into a cloud both hot and cold leaving us feeling clammy. The sun came out for a beautiful afternoon. The rolling hills and moderate terrain melted away and we arrived at the hut at 3:30. It was already bustling with activity. Shoe (now trail shoe) was there, 2 guys from LA are hiking the Shenandoah National Park. Steve-O hiked the AT a couple years ago and brought his friend to hike for a week. Steve secretly whispered to us, ""should I show him or do you want to watch him figure it out."" We opted for hiker tv and watched his friend fumble through the evening tasks. Also The Three Musketeers 3 retired guys related by marriage are also out for a week. Simple Man and Quirks were there and later Andy from New Hampshire by the mt. mousalauke area. I was very excited when Savage arrived. She, cool dad, black Santa and shaggy/ mc double stayed for dinner then went camping at a view spot. Savage also had a lot to say about her upcoming date and kept us entertained for an hour before moving on. We had our evening meal and set up in the hut. Things quieted down, but someone got a game of pitch going. I was first one in the sack with ear plugs in and asleep.Today's delight.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534369,"May 20th. I had made my breakfast a la el tehano ( carnation instant breakfast, cocoa, and powder milk) the night before. That is what I had on the way out. We were the last ones out at 7:30 am. We had 14 miles planned.The whole day was gorgeous beautiful weather. The rolling hills were a little more tiring, but we had a great opportunity for a wayside lunch. That meant we had a half mile hike off the trail, but we would have real food. We ordered a bacon cheeseburger, fries and blackberry milkshake. Our way back to the trail we saw a mama bear and three Cubs. That was very exciting. Bombadil tried to get a video of their capers. Simple Man and quirks were right behind us. They missed the Bears but saw a giant rattle snake. For some reason they picked it up with their poles. I was glad to not see the snake.I had a harder time hiking after lunch with such a full belly. It was getting warmer but still beautiful. I sent Bombadil ahead to the hut. I strolled along and took pictures of flowers and views. I passed by the burned area from a month ago. 17 miles of the Shenandoah forest burned in April. There were some very scorched trees. In one area I came across a buck with velvety antlers and 2 does were on the other side of the trail. The buck looked right at me and then wondered off. The does ran right at me until they saw me. Then they put in on the breaks and looked like oops, I'm not supposed to be going this way. All were very thin from foraging in the burned forest.I got to the hut at 3:30 and took the last spot. Since I had a big lunch I just had my lunch snacks for dinner. Hopefully I won't wake up at 2 am hungry with my food in a tree.Today's delight. A sleuth of bearsToday's opportunity for learning.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534482,"May 21st. There were 10 of us in the shelter. 6 were a group hiking together through the Shenandoah national park for a week. They had met while hiking over the last 25 years. All now retired, 2 of the group are section hiking the AT and nearly complete. Since they were such a big group the 4 AT hikers all decided to wait until they were packed and out before adding to the morning chaos. It was also raining. It took them 3 hours. I was so hungry by the time they finally got their back packs off the breakfast table. I started the stove and had oatmeal. I had my carnation breakfast already made, but I would eat that later on the trail. It was a cold rainy morning, I wanted warm food. We already were getting a late start, no need rush into the rain. We were out at 10:00am.We had planned a 15 mile day. My map showed a former shelter site. I thought there might be some tent sites remaining and a water source. My feet were very tired by the time we got there. The no camping signs started showing up. Disheartened, I still wanted to walk down and see. It turns out the Potomac AT club has the shelter for there own use and it is locked with no camping signs on it. I was so ready to be done, but Bombadil had another idea.We ended up at a campground nearby which had many added luxuries such as a shower and a small store. Having walked through the rain all day I was soggy and chilled. A shower sounded marvelous, so did food. The shower was coin operated. $1.00 for 5 minutes. I spent $2.00 on hot water that day! I was given a towel to use and my own little bar of soap. I spent the next ten minutes soaking in happiness.The store was simple food, but I found a ham and cheese sandwich, chips and a beer. I couldn't be happier. The store had stayed open just for us so we could warm up and shower, but many people showed up at the end buying food. We must have been a sight walking into camp a bedraggled mess for the camp host to take such pity on us.Today's delight. Whistling with the birds in the rain.Today's opportunity for learning.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534547,"May 22nd. Well, it was still soggy and raining through the night. The morning was wet fog. We were in the tent wondering when would be a good time to get out. Did the rain slow down? Is it still raining? How about now? We gathered our food bag from the bear box and started packing. I had my instant breakfast and was packed and hiking on the AT at 7:10 am. It never downpoured on us. We just stayed soggy all day. Our shoes were wet. Bombadil had on full rain gear and I just wore my jacket. Knowing the weather forecast Bombadil had made reservations at Great Meadow Lodge several days in advance. It is a lovely old fashioned place. The grand lodge has dining and a sitting room. Our room was small but comfortable. We're got there long before check in. I was hoping they would let us check in, but no. We were directed to the campground where we could take coin operated showers and do our laundry. The hot water at this campground was much more expensive. $1.75 for 5 minutes. I needed 10 minutes. I washed some of the mud off my shoes and put shampoo on my pole straps. The smell had started to bother me. After showers Bombadil and I both worked on laundry. I fluffed my down sleeping bag in the dryer it got so bulky, but I still had to stuff it in its tiny sack. I also washed my down jacket. It had been raining hard intermittently while doing laundry so we had to time our trek back up to the lodge. They really weren't helping us by any degree, but it was time for lunch. We had a very yummy lunch. It was finally almost 3:00 and they gave us a key, but said the room wouldn't be ready for 15 minutes. At least all our chores were done and we got to our room to rest for the afternoon. We woke up and were ready for more food. We got seated at 7:00 for dinner. They were so busy we didn't get served for an hour and a half. No discount though, most expensive dinner of my life.

He wanted us to have shelter for the night and decided to leave for our 15 mile hike at 6:00am. I wanted to take full advantage of our super expensive accommodations and have a filling breakfast. I did go to breakfast and had an omelet. Unfortunately the eggs were burned and the potatoes were cold, not my favorite breakfast. The rest of the morning I spent going through my pack, resorting food for three more days until our next resupply, and writing letters to my parents and for grandpa's 92nd birthday. I checked out at 11:00. I hiked all day by myself. It was very pleasant. The rain that was predicted never really came. I was all set for rain with my pack cover and rain coat tied to my pack. It sprinkled twice for less than a minute. Cool dada, shags and black Santa passed me. They were headed to the same shelter for the night, but stopped for hot lunch right after meeting me. Shags had just seen and taken a picture of an owl. After they turned off I saw a small bobcat. My picture barely shows an animal. I showed it to cool dad later and he said,"" yep, that's verification."" I was able to talk to Bombadil several times during the day. He offered encouragement and told me to stop for a sandwich at skyland and stop at pinnacle picnic area for water.While I was getting my water a group of Indian men in their kaftans dancing to very loud music. They were very cute twirling to their music. I had 2 miles to go.I arrived just as the sky was getting dark with ominous clouds. Bombadil had saved me a spot and helped me set up my sleeping bag. Since I had lunch at 3pm I just ate some lunch snacks from my bag. New faces tonight, lava monster, Macgiver, Brian and Michael south bounders. Gipetto and 2 section hikers.As I was settling in for the night more people were showing up including cool dad, shags and black Santa. Shortly after they arrived there was bear excitement. We had a very precocious bear. She was coming in at least the edges and not very worried about us as several people crowded around for photos. It turned out it was mama bear. She had two cubs that were staying on the edges of the woods. The three stayed near the rest of the evening. Hoping for a safe night.Today's delight.

Bombadil rolled over and asked me if I was ready to get hiking. NO!! I slept for another hour and a half and we were first out at 6:40 am. It was beautiful. The sun was shining. The air was fresh, the trail was beginning to dry out just a little. We had 17 miles planned. We pretty much hiked without taking a break until 1 pm when we got to elks wallow, a wayside right on the trail. We had planned on having a nice lunch break then finishing the last 6 miles with a big climb to the shelter. Lunch was heavenly. Chips burgers and milkshakes with a candy bar on the side. We ate with sharky who we have been hiking with for the last 2 weeks and Macgiver who we met last night at the shelter. Bombadil said we will stay a whole hour to rest. We were so relaxed and chatting it was 2 hours between got going again. Did I say it was a beautiful day. I tried hiking in my workout bra, but now my whole back is raw from my backpack. Oops.We continue to see much more wildlife in the Shenandoah park than previously on the trail. New birds, deer every day, bear sightings by us or other hikers daily. The music of the birds is sweet and constant. I am at the top of a mountain with the wind blowing keeping me cool and most of the bugs away. I have an amazing view of the world around me.

We got going pretty quickly ourselves. I had made my instant breakfast the night before and Bombadil made me a peanut butter wrap. It was another beautiful day warming up within an hour. The trail was filled with wildlife again. I saw 2 bears, deer stared at me from the trail and an owl. I kept trying to photograph a piliated wood pecker, but they fly off whenever I approach. I took a break at 10:30. Bombadil wouldn't wait so I didn't see him again until I got to the hostel. 100 yards past my break spot was a stream and I stopped again to sawyer squeeze my water. I also had a lunch break at the Tom Floyd shelter with magic man, chaser and rhino.I was nearly at the top of the last peak of the day. The descent into town was a constant steady downhill. Everything was pretty. The spring air was smelling sweet. The streams were full and rushing from all the recent rain. One crossing I felt like I was in Maine wondering how to get across, but there were enough stones to hop across safely.I got to town after climbing one last uphill then down to the road. There was a long fence. I couldn't imagine who would put up such an amazingly large fence and not maintain it as many trees had fallen on it rendering it useless. I thought, it must be the government. The smithsonian has a protected breading ground with gazelle and other exotic endangered species. Lots of fence!!I got to mountain home bed and breakfast cabbin about 2:30. It was 90' and I was wilting. Bombadil met me with a glass of lemonade that went down wonderfully. I also has 2 more glasses of water, but was still thirsty. Showered and after a nap I wanted to go to the post office to send home some of the weight out of my pack. After being so hot the night before I sent home my long underwear and other things I haven't used for 2 months, mostly medicine and bandage things. We did laundry, groceries and Mexican food for dinner. The evening we spent going through our packs.

They offer breakfast and we had thought 6:30 would be early enough to eat and get out to beat the heat. We had an uphill climb right at the start and sweat was dripping off us within the hour.Even thought it hasn't rained for three days the trail was very muddy. Each step was a sliding slurping tug on our shoes. Finding a dry step wasn't an option. Finding a rock to step on, there were to few. We just walked in the mud.We continued on until 12:00. We came to a picnic table in the shade. I was feeling kind of yucky due to the heat so we had a long break eating lunch and rehydrating. While there we met buckaroo bonsai and cable southbound section hikers who were going to call for a ride to front Royal to make it to the post office before it closed. Buckaroo bonsai had a car in town and offered to drive cable about town.Feeing better but still worried about the heat we started uphill again. We had just a couple miles to the next shelter. I told Bombadil I needed to stop there again because of the heat and we did. We had another long break. I suggested we stay there. I could feeling a breeze while lying in the shelter, but we had planned 15 miles. Bombadil ended up going ahead while I had an afternoon siesta. I spent 2 more hours just not moving, drinking water and staying reasonably cool. Shire and greenleaf arrived. We had met them earlier in a meadow with a bench. Shire is just starting a through hike with greenleaf going along for the first week. They looked chipper, but hot on their second successful day of hiking. Sparky came by( the younger version) and we chatted a bit as he also cooled off. We were deciding siestas may become a regular thing as it will be in the 90's all week. He went on saying he would stop at dick's dome where we were also staying. I gathered more water and started on as well at about 4pmIt had begun to cool some, I was mostly in the shade and there was an occasional breeze. The first uphill climb was like the previous, drenched!! But, by the time I finished the last 5 miles it was quite pleasant out. I had considered telling Bombadil we would hike further, but my feet knew they had hiked 15 miles and we're done for the day.Dick's dome shelter is a geodesic shelter that sleeps 4. Bombadil was the only one there. I was disappointed it was 0.4 miles off the trail, but it was right next to a stream. Bombadil was bobbing in the steam with mariachi music playing when I arrived. He hadn't seen sparky. I suspect he kept hiking as it was cooling and nice hiking at last. I settled in and splashed in the cold stream as well.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535484,"May 27th. I didn't enjoy my night in dicks dome. The shelter was surrounded by mud. The mosquitos were threatening but hadn't yet started to bite. It was a hot night so I had decided to use my sarong for a sheet. In the middle of the night it was pulled off of me by a mouse. A mouse also pooped in my cup and ate through 4 layers of plastic to shred my toilet paper. I keep mentioning to Bombadil I want to sleep I the tent. This will be my last night in a shelter.I had thought we might have another muddy day. The trail swept back and forth around the stream several times with rock hopping and plenty of mud, but it quickly went uphill to a very well maintained path. It was even mown grass for which I was thankful to keep ticks at bay. As we walked along the humid air held the perfume of roses, honeysuckle and blackberry blossoms. The world smelled so sweet. Later on the trail we came to a tulip tree grove. Tulip trees are so elegant. They have long straight trucks and are very tall. Some of them swirled in a vortex leaving the bark to fall into a lattice pattern. The tulip tree flowers littered the ground in their bright yellow orange and green arrays. Some flowers were accompanied by their pretty leaves which have 4 points with a dip in the center top. It was a grand, grand forest grove.The next shelter was at the 9 mile mark. I had hoped to take another siesta, but I was actually feeling much better than the day before and since we left so early in the morning hiking by 6:30 am it was only 11am. We decided to stop for lunch anyway and get some water. We had a food break and Bombadil read the shelter register. Trooper Dot who we had met on the trail the day before had signed in. She was thinking our American miles are longer than those measured in Zimbabwe where she is from. She was such a delight to meet on the trail. We told her our trail names and said we are online. She replied there is no IT in darkest Africa. She looked impossibly old, but I thought maybe it was African sun had damaged her skin. I later found out she is 84 years old. Chompa had met her at mountain home cabbin and asked her when she will through hike. She replied, I'm past my sell by date. I will not do that. One of the last entries was from our friend Savage. She was still trying to catch up with cool dad and black Santa. She had left this shelter at 5:30 in the morning. She was sure to comment that she cleaned up a giant snake skin from the top bunk. After lunch I decided I would take a break and nap. Bombadil didn't want to stay so he went ahead. Sharky came by and took a short break at that time, but I was left to nap by myself. When I woke up I was somewhat alarmed to find that giant snake who had just shed its skin, that Savage had found, hanging above me in the rafters. It was 4 feet or so long. It was black with a white neck and did not look venomous. It didn't move. I wondered if it was alive, but later it was verified that it was. Unnerved by its presence I got going at 1 pm. The next peril I came to on the trail was a rattlesnake. I was so fortunate that I was distracted by an older man tromping off the trail to my right. He shouted out, young lady, hold up a minute. There is a snake In the trail, let me point it out to you. I was so thankful he hailed my attention. I was about 20 ft away from the snake and had not yet noticed it. As the two of us got closer the snake was already tightly coiled and angrily rattling its tail without pause. The gentleman suggested I take the higher ground. He had just come from lower ground which was filled with sticks. His legs had gotten scratched. The higher ground was filled with poison ivy and poison oak. I tried my best to avoid brushing against it in my bare legs. I was safely on the other side as more people came along. Yes, the snake is still there. Word had spread down the trail to watch out.The terrain I had been on since the last shelter was called the roller coaster. Looking at the map it didn't look terrible, but comments in the register would suggest otherwise. If it hadn't been 90' I probably could have handled it. But hot and hills is hard. Sweat dripping from my face and elbows all day. Half way through today's portion of the roller coaster I came to a road. My hopes soared as I saw a truck with chairs set up. Could it be trail magic? Our first since the very beginning of Virginia 500 miles ago when we met Trial and Error? Lavender and Count had hiked in 2014 and we're giving back to the trail. The day before I was remembering a trip I had taken with my yoga friends. I had learned watermelon is cooling. I had a wish just the day before for some watermelon and here it was today offered to me. I sat with lavender and count for well over an hour. They were so fun to visit with. Of all the people we had met they were like Bombadil and me. A couple hiking.As thunder was rumbling in the distance and it became well past dinner I excused myself from a wonderful afternoon of company and delightful trail magic to finish the last few miles. It never rained. Bombadil had set the tent up for me, but he slept in the shelter. I didn't feel like eating much but I picked at some food so I wouldn't be hungry later.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535656,"May 28th. The table was crowded with hikers, and a trail runner. A troop of scouts came and set up right before dark. The shelter was full for the holiday weekend, the last spot taken at 8pm as people kept arriving. This is one of the few nights there was a fire circle with chatting into the night. Bombadil had his space in the shelter and as promised had set the tent up for me to sleep in. I was a little restless sleeping alone and trying to wrestle with the temperature, hot then cold through the night, but I felt rested in the morning. The heat being so oppressive we planned on getting going early again. I was already awake when Bombadil came to get me at 5 am. I packed and was ready quickly, but I waited for Bombadil and we were hiking by 6 am. Better than the day before, but I would have liked even earlier. The sweat was immediate, pouring off of us by 6:15 am as we passed the 1000 mile mark.There was a hiker hostel 3 miles ahead that was supposed to be a landmark stop and they served breakfast. That was also part of our motivation to get going and arrive before 9 am. The side trip was a let down. No food was available to those stopping by. We toured the bears den castle grounds and checked out their hiker accommodations. We got more water and threw away trash then back to the trail. We were still on the section considered the roller coaster. It was already hot. We just kept hiking. I was more hungry today than I had been. Insatiable hunger. I kept drinking and stopping to eat a hiker bar, oh, no breakfast today since our side trip hadn't worked out as planned. We kept leap frogging with a couple one of whom was living in Newton mass to attend Andover Newton theological school. Bombadil stayed with me until we were done with the roller coaster section. The remaining part of the trail was supposed to be flat all the way to the shelter. The only real obstacle was the heat which was really getting to me. I was developing a head ache and my legs despite drinking plenty of water and adding electrolytes were threatening to cramp, so I stopped and took a nap on a log. I was still really hungry to. I decided I would make my carnation breakfast at 2 pm maybe the protein would help. I had 4.4 miles to go.I started passing large teams of people wearing black shirts. The shirts said ruck to remember 60 to 60. I tried to ask the first groups what it was about and what their shirts meant, but they were really marching out and didn't stop to answer. The last group I came to had a man down. I asked if I could help, but they everything handled. Likely heat exhaustion he was undressed and cool compresses applied. He was eventually evacuated via helicopter rescue from the trail. They were however stopped and told me they were on a memorial hike. 60 miles to area 60 at Arlington cemetery. They had started at Harper's Ferry West Virginia and were hiking to Washington, D.C. They were hiking 20 miles a day for 3 days in 90' heat. Did I mention it was hot.I had 3 miles to go. I passed a hand written note, snake ahead. I looked and listened carefully, but I didn't see or hear one. The rest of the hike was uneventful and I arrived at the shelter as predicted at 4:30 pm. It was a very nice shelter with a large deck. The deck had a long bench and also an adirondack couch. I collapsed on the couch leaning against my pack. It was the most comfortable I have ever been on the trail. Bombadil was off getting water which unfortunately was a long hike downhill away. He had set up in the shelter and put the tent up for me again. He was still hoping I would choose the shelter, I didn't. It might have been a better choice to sleep in the shelter, it had a breeze and the tent was very still and hot. I liked being protected from mice and snakes and bugs in the tent.It was a lovely evening. I took a turn going for water and rinsed off in the cold spring. Chompa who we last saw in Glasgow before trail days sat with us all evening catching up on where all our friends were on the trail and telling funny stories. We had an ATC volunteer staying that night with his son. I began to think the ATC of PATC had asked volunteers to stay at each shelter for the holiday weekend to make sure nothing happened. He was also interesting to hang out with and he shared his cookies with Bombadil and me. It was a late night for us after visiting and we wanted to start early again tomorrow.Today's delight. Hiking past our 1000 mile marker, a comfortable place to sit on the Adirondack couchToday's opportunity for learning. The heat can take you down, be careful.","sam moore shelter

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535658,"May 29th. Another day to beat the heat we got up and were hiking by 6:30 am. We had less than 10 miles to hike into Harper's Ferry where the Appalachian trail concervency headquarters is located and the official though not actual halfway point is. The trail was a gradual and occasionally very rocky downhill. As we approached town and the road the trail had the usual steeper area with switchbacks down the hill.While on retreat with my yoga friends I was dared for $500 to wear my silk sarong all day hiking. We laughed and settled on a box of love sent to me on the trail. However, today as we hiked into Harper's Ferry I chose to fulfill my dare. I dressed in my sarong and hiked in it all day. I have carried it with me from the start of my trip. I have been so happy to have it with me. I use it for town clothes ( the only thing that I have to make me look even a little dressed up on the trail) I have used it for a towel ( cross with Bombadil about those circumstances) and I have used it for a sheet. I would recommend anyone bring a sarong on a hike, though not necessarily a silk one. So Elizabeth, I'm ready for my box.We got to the road which had a pedestrian way along a very busy road and bridge over the beautiful Shenandoah river. Bombadil had several renditions of the song on his phone which we played and sung along to. We got to the ATC before noon. We had our pictures taken for this years register and received our resupply package. They have couches and computers for hikers to use and we sat there and repacked our bags. We had planned on staying overnight in town but hadn't yet made accommodations. I tried looking on my phone with bad cell service for a place with laundry. Eventually we went for a walk and sat with crisscross, Sunray and chompa for a coffee break. I had water as I have been caffeine free for several weeks now. I was hoping the coffee shop had lemonade on such a hot day, but they didn't even have water. I drank my own. Bombadil found us a shuttle and I found us a place to stay. Harper's Ferry isn't really set up to be super hiker friendly. We ended up in Charles Town at a motel 6 with a Walmart across the street. We had Chinese for lunch and pizza for dinner. We watched movies and game of thrones until bedtime.Today's delight. The thick humid air was so sweet with honeysuckle my mouth was watering and the Shenandoah river is so wide and beautiful.Today's opportunity for learning. Sarongs can be very useful on a long hike.","david lesser shelter

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536007,"May 30th. It was genuinely beautiful out. Mid 80's too hot for some of the climbing we did, but we had a lot of flat terrain. We got a shuttle from our hotel room at 10:00am and stopped at the outfitters for stove fuel. We got going at 11:00 am. It was kind of late for starting a 15 mile hike on a hot day. I, of course, tried to talk Bombadil into shorter miles, but he cannot be swayed. We stopped at the first shelter for a break. We met some new people and trooper and 2 socks were already there having a lunch break. Mustard offered to take everyone's water containers to get water as it was very far from the shelter down a steep hill. That was incredibly nice. I helped out by offering my slack pack bag to help carry the bottles. Bombadil didn't want to wait so he went ahead. Black bear showed up. He had been off the trail for almost a week visiting family and his girlfriend. He was super tired and experienced the emotional turmoil of trail reentry that I had. He was going to the next shelter and calling it a day.I was tired to. I hadn't slept well for many days and the heat had been so draining. I texted Bombadil my complaints since he wasn't nearby to listen. Further down the trail was a nice park with running water and bathrooms. Blackbear was still there but I guess I had just missed a big crowd of hikers including Bombadil. I was really glad blackbear was there or I would have lost track of the trail in the park. I had a snack and water and refilled by water bottles. 5 more miles to go, but it would be close to 8 pm before I got to the shelter. I got there before dark. Bombadil hadn't set up the tent and got Sunray to apply peer pressure to entice me to sleep in the shelter. It was a brand new shelter with polished floors. No mice or snakes were evident. I wasn't excited about it, it looked hot, but I went along.I was right about hot. I didn't sleep.Today's delight. Monuments and parksToday's opportunity for learning. Leaving town early is hard, but I should try harder to do it. I don't like hiking until late into the evening.","harpers ferry

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536008,"May 31st. I was the last one to get moving this morning. We had hot oatmeal and were packed and hiking by 7:45. We passed into Maryland yesterday morning. Maryland has had many nice parks for hikers to pass through and they have even made backpacker campgrounds with running water, showers and flush toilets. They spoil us!! Sure beats a privy. We had so many opportunities to take water breaks in these nice parks it slowed our progress a bit.It was pretty and hot out. So many days of hot weather and lack of sleep seem to be slowing both Bombadil and me down. The terrain was moderate most of the day except a mile of rock hopping. I got to the shelter at 5 pm an hour later than the morning predictions. We were very close to a town. I had texted Bombadil to see if he ordered pizza. This was another day my hunger had not been satisfied all day. His phone was off. When I got to the shelter I asked again about pizza.He was startled. Woohoo, what? Pizza??? We made it happen and ordered enough to share a piece with everyone there. Today's delight. A forest grove of mountain laurel.Today's opportunity for learning. I seem to have more hiker hunger than usual lately.","rocky run shelter

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536236,"June 1st. Nope. I didn't sleep. It had been cooler and I chose the tent again while Bombadil was in the shelter, but I spent the night tangled in my sarong and sleeping bag sliding to the edges of the tent. They say sleep is a great mood stabilizer so essentially I was an insane cranky hot sweaty mess all day.It was really pretty out and not quite as humid as it had been, but I struggled all morning. I walked by a stream and noted how cool the air felt. I came to the next stream and sat down for a break. Bombadil was worried about me and suggested that I get a ride ahead to PenMar park. Feeling stubborn I wanted to hike all the way through Maryland, not skip ahead. We hit a very technical area of scree/ fallen rock tumble. I was so thankful that someone had marked out the way in little orange marker flags and ribbons. It was impossible to look ahead and see the best path on your own. It reminded me of the movie Brave when the will-o-the-wisps lead the way. Right after that Bombadil rushed ahead to the park. I had a fall near a cliff and some steps that could have ended badly, but didn't. Once you lose your balance with your pack on things get tricky. Thank goodness for trekking poles. I made it to PenMar park. Bombadil was not there. Other hikers were gathered, Fiddy shrimp, Nemo, and Papa monkey. They informed me Bombadil had hitched to get food. I collapsed on a park bench. My head was on my pack and my arm slung over my head and eyes to rest. Bombadil arrived shortly after with a box of food. How are you feeling honey, he asked. No, was all I said. Nemo laughed at my reply. Just no, she says. I held out my hand so Bombadil could help me up off the bench and my whole back spasmed. I grimaced so intensely in pain, luckily it didn't last. What I feel is why am I not good at this yet? I have hiked more than 1000 miles. I should feel like I am good at this. Nemo replied again. ""It doesn't get easier, you just have to find your sweet spot. For me it is 15 miles which I can do in 6 hours. If I do more I can't walk the next day.""We had another leisurely hour of eating and visiting then got going. I let Bombadil know I would have been happy to stay here. My champions asked why Bombadil was in such a rush it's not healthy to hike in 90' on full stomach. In the end what saved me was the post office. On our current trajectory we were headed into boiling springs, our next resupply on Saturday evening. That left us with a spare 36 hours. Bombadil started calculating. We would take a zero day. We hiked to the next road. While I was at PenMar park I checked my journal and Vicki, a reader, had said she would like to meet me with trail magic. Unfortunately, I didn't get the message soon enough, but I did reply. She was so sweet to leave a note and some goodies for us at the next road. We had missed her by 15 minutes. What was special was how much it meant to me on such a hard day for someone to cheer me on. Having her tell me I am incredible for my accomplishment and doing a great job boosted me more than I can tell you. The home made cookies were something special to. Extra yummy for some reason.Today's delight. Vicki's encouragement and post office hoursToday's opportunity for learning. Find the sweet spot.","ensign shelter

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536736,"June 2nd. A zero day. Bombadil decided to hike anyway. I rested and went to breakfast at 9 am. The hotel offered a very nice selection of food. I had yogurt, a waffle and rainbow colored fruit loops. Mostly I rested and watched American Restoration until Bombadil returned. After a relaxing afternoon we did laundry and went for food at Waynesburger. I thought it would be elegant or pub like inside, but it had a fast food feel. The food there is fantastic. American/ Greek cuisine is offered. Bombadil had bought me a burger the day before and I loved it. Today I chose falafel and a Ruben sandwich. The falafel was really good, but I wished I had stuck with the burger. On the way back to our room we finished our milkshakes.The evening was spent channel surfing. Today's delight.

The weather has improved marginally and is 10' cooler in the 80's but still humid. Roger has been our shuttle for 2 days. He has people sign a book and as I sign I look through to see who has been around. Booksmarts. Is now off the trail and going home. Sparky signed the book, but we don't know which one. Spice who we met at ensign shelter was in the same hotel and we saw her at laundry. I offered her my left over permethrin I had just sprayed my clothes, shoes and pack with, Bombadil wouldn't use it. I had decided it was time to spray again after Bombadil got 2 ticks and chompa had pulled a small tick off of him that had just bitten him.We got to the trail at 9:00. As soon as we got out of Roger's car trail magic appeared. Honeydew thruhiker 2009. Was passing out goodies to hikers. Bombadil declined because he was full from hotel breakfast, but I said yes, please!! He gave me fresh strawberries and a kiwi. It was such a treat. Later that day we met many other people who had chosen other treats from honeydew, such as beer. Our hike was really great. We had 2 climbs for the day. The first was very moderate. At noon we got to Caledonia park. It has a pool and snack bar open daily (except not yet). We met several despondent hikers looking at a snack menu that still says daily. Someone even called a park ranger about when it would be open. ""Tomorrow, on Saturday "" was the reply. We had a long by break anyway and sat with Kenya who we hadn't seen for ages and mustard. Kenya had poison ivy and was not very comfortable. Mustard had broken his spoon and was trying to attach a stick to make a handle. As we sat there we met many new people. Star brother, nums and megafauna, greyhound, chopper and his brother. Our next climb of the day was not so moderate. Straight up out of the park headed to the next shelter 4 miles down the trail. The extra effort of climbing in the humid air had me drenched in sweat in moments. It also began to sprinkle. My new tactic for rain that day was to wear a shower cap from the hotel. As long as my hair stays dry I'm fine in the rain. I'm wet anyway from hiking. We got to quarry gap shelter just before it started to rain harder. We took another long break that included me taking a nap while Bombadil socialized with more new people. Quarry gap shelter is very well maintained. It is surrounded with gravel and had flowers hanging. It looks like they will hang a swing soon and are currently improving the fire pit.We had 7.5 miles to go and it was quite late for us to make that many miles at 3:30. The terrain was mostly easy and we made it to the next shelter at 6:30. The only excitement on that section was a quick down and up that had a locked cabin. On the way back up the hill I came very close to a rattlesnake. It startled me and I jumped back. Looking more closely it did not look like it could harm us. At first it looked dead, but it began to shake it's tail. This particular snake was occupied with eating its dinner. The tail end of a red squirrel was left to be eaten by this fat snake. His mouth was distended with food and not likely to strike at us.At the shelter we met all new people. Jester, wild turkey, greyhound, chopper and chud, lieutenant Dan, and rookie who Bombadil named that night. We all sat amiably and ate dinner sharing stories until dark. Then we raced to sleepToday's delight. Miles and miles and miles of full peak of bloom mountain laurel along the trail and reaching to the end of sight into the woodsToday's opportunity for learning.

I was among the first to get moving and deflate my sleeping pad and head for the privy. I slept with in the shelter again. The first thing I noticed was my shredded toilet paper. I had lost half of my toilet paper to mice. We ate breakfast. I had oatmeal and I had a fresh apple still in my bag and a Nutella tortilla. I was full. I looked over at Bombadil. He had finished eating but hadn't started packing. He was on the top bunk. His belongings covered one end to the other. It didn't look like he was living out of a pack for 3 months. He sent me ahead while he packed.I finally, after many almost days made it to the OFFICIAL half way point. In the word of another hiker the marker is very underwhelming. I was still ahead of Bombadil, but I decided to wait. The register was in a box at the sign and I read through. When Bombadil finally arrived he didn't know what I was doing. He thought the halfway point would come later in the day. We posed for pictures and signed in then went on our merry way. The hike was not vigorous. But for some reason my feet were tired very early in the trip. We had a short day planned 11 miles to pine grove furnace general store and the half gallon challenge. On our way there we passed 1100 miles. When we arrived chud, greyhound and lieutenant Dan were just finishing their half gallon. For their efforts they were charged $9.00 a stomachache and received a tiny wooden spoon stamped that they had completed the challenge. Bombadil got an ice cream cone. I didn't have any. Someone offered me half of their veggie wrap which was the best I have ever tasted. We decided to stay at the park campsite which meant we would have to pay. It was more expensive than expected, but they had showers. We set up the tent had our showers then waited out some afternoon storms to go back to the general store for dinner. The grill closed at 6:00. On our way there we got caught in the rain. We tried hitching the 0.5 miles, but no one picked us up. We arrived very soggy. Our tenting neighbors had gotten there before it started to pour. I ordered a very delicious hamburger with avocados and had coconut water to drink. Bombadil had a salad since had the hiker burger for lunch a monstrous concoction that included fried eggs and an obscene amount of fries.While we waited out the rain rookie who was hiking with her mother, posh arrived soaked and bedraggled. They rallied and were cheerful for their yummy food. There was a shuttle guy named Mike sitting around. We were about to ask him for a ride when kinder offered to take us to our campsite. We were very worried about our tent because we hadn't closed it for the rain. She has hiked many sections and just finished the Shenandoah park. People had given her so many rides she wanted to pay it forward. Kinder named such for having been a retired kindergarten teacher was as sweet as you would imagine. She held my hand in friendship and kindness wishing me well on my journey. Such deep kindness I felt In her soft hands.Our other camp neighbor whose name I didn't learn is on a personal retreat trying to figure out how to manage midlife. Three small kids a wife and middle management job, what are the options for the most rewarding life? Make a change or stay the course? These are his questions for his week alone camping. I offered my take on what it felt like to move frequently as a child and he understood what I was trying to say.We got to the tent and the wet inside was not intolerable.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536882,"June 5th. We woke up early. Rain was predicted for the whole day. Some people in the state park we were tenting in suggested some of the storms moving through might be violent and windy. We had hiker bars from r breakfast and were packed and hiking by 7 am. The first part of the trail was still in the park. It was flat and even terrain. As soon as we left the park we had a steep climb over a washed out road. We kept a very quick pace for 3 hours until we came to the shelter at the 7 mile mark. Bombadil checked the weather as this was the first time we had service all morning. He thought we had a big enough window to make it to a hiker friendly general store before the rain. We met 2 hikers sparky showed up behind us and star brother who we saw leaving the store. He informed us it was close and they had a grill and subs. We were definitely headed there and we made it before the rain. We spent about an hour at green mountain general merchandise. We both had breakfast subs and other food we were craving like chips, donuts, and juice. I also had a delicious cherry pie, my favorite. We stayed until the showers passed and the power started flickering. They would have to close if it stayed off so we got ready to go. We had 8 more miles to go. The terrain the second half of the day was slightly more difficult. At the top of one hill was a rock maze. I was hoping there wouldn't be too much rock scaling as I am not good at that. I lucked out. It was really more cute than anything. In the end there were only 3 difficult steps, one of which required me to take off my pack, the other 2 knees on rocks. I made it. We met a day hiker who was racing to beat the rain. I checked the weather again. We had to get moving. We had 2 more large hills in front of us to get to the shelter and beat the rain.10 minutes. I missed by ten minutes. My shirt stayed dry in the sprinkles then the deluge hit. I didn't even need a freedom step. I was soaked from head to toe with my feet sloshing in my shoes in moments. In reality it was refreshing. I got to the shelter and Bombadil said don't bring your mess inside. I began the complicated process of in hindering myself from a wet pack and shoes while maintaining a clean space. Afterward I stood in the warm rain and showered. It was wonderful and I felt so clean.Tenting didn't seem to be an option. The shelter was on a rocky hill. I slept in the shelter again. We met captain clueless out to hike Pennsylvania and patriot from Massachusetts doing a through hike. Both were chatty and friendly. Patriot had come in after me also a soggy mess. The four of us sat out the rain and had dinner later than usual waiting for the rain to abate.Today's delight. Showering in the rainToday's opportunity for learning.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537368,"June 6th. We were awake and out with patriot at 6:15. We had such a long day planned, 18 miles. Our first task was to get into the town of boiling springs 4 miles down the hill. We wanted to arrive early enough to have breakfast in town before the post office opened at 9:00. My tag reads: Caution, do not expose to direct sunlight. Wilting may occur. There has been a lot of trail chatter about this 18 mile section. ""It's flat"", "" it's through farmers fields"", ""it's in the sun all day"", "" there is not place to stop, rest or take a break."" I have been worried and planning for weeks about how to manage a full day exposed to the sun. A week ago I purchased a hand held fan/ mister. I forgot batteries at the time. And, I have been on the hunt for an umbrella to serve as a parasol. After breakfast I was went to the food mart next door. Kenny the proprietor was very friendly and helpful. He made sure I had everything I needed. I left with my batteries and umbrella.We got our packages and sat at the ATC across the street to repack with our resupply as well as a card from Maureen and a box from Pam with delicious home made cookies. We were headed out again at 10:30 after a 2&1/2 hour break. Headed into 14 miles of fields I felt prepared. As usual trail chatter rarely lives up to expectations. In reality I spent very little time in direct sunlight. We walked along the edges of fields and through border lands that had plenty of trees with shade and a nice breeze. There were only 2 fields longer than 100 yards. For all of them I used my parasol. The real obstacles of the day were mud, poison ivy and rose bushes. It had rained so hard the day before for 14 miles I slogged through, with mud pulling at my shoes, 2 inches of squishy mud. I had hoped the flat even terrain ,even though longer miles were planned, would be easy. Well, mud is tiring. The trail was less than a foot wide with poison ivy and roses encroaching at the edges. I spent the day on high alert dodging the worst of the mud and avoiding the greenery biting at my ankles. Coming down a hill into the largest field I met a cow. She was with her friends, just on the wrong side of the fence. The farmhouse was nearby and not out of the way so I stopped to tell them, but no one was home. Crossing this large field I began to get very tired and my feet were sore enough to slow me down. I climbed up and over the stiles to the cow yards then up and over again out the other side. I noticed a picnic table near a pond and under a maple tree. I took this as a sign, I would take a long break to finally dry out my feet. My shoes had not dried yet from the day before, I was worried I was getting blisters. Though shriveled my feet were intact. I drank, ate and rested for 45 minutes. As I was packing up to leave an ATV came along with a dog running next to it. It was a farmer out walking his dog. This was probably his bench and his pond. I asked if he knew his neighbors as their cow was loose. He nodded and said he would call. He also said they had regular escapees that came home for dinner.I felt reasonably refreshed and finished my last 4 miles to the shelter. There was a pretty big crowd since this was the first place to break after such a long hike. Bombadil had set up the tent for me in a very flat location. We visited with those that were familiar to us, Nemo, Kenya, Mustard, and others whose names I didn't learn. Today's delight. My parasol Today's opportunity for learning.

That was all we got for rain. It was a beautiful day for hiking. Very early in our hike we had another field. I was happy to have my parasol handy. It was at least a mile in the sun. We hiked along nearing Duncannon when at 12:00 the town whistle blew. I haven't heard a town whistle in a long time. The last bit of terrain into Duncannon is difficult. Many rocks, and rock slides for footing were slowing me down but someone had made steps and that helped a lot. The last bit was very steep I was getting ready to have the road appear. Of course it did, right when I thought I couldn't take another step. We had 1 mile of walking on the road to The Doyle Hotel. As we were headed to The Doyle, Bombadil stopped at a convenience store and bought us some chocolate milk, our favorite recovery drink. Wandurer was there for the hot dogs. Duncannon is a fairly broken down town. We passed the laundromat, goodies breakfast place and a pizza parlor. Then we arrive at The Doyle. It is a giant beautiful historic building needing nothing but repair. They are known for being hiker friendly and that is were everyone has gathered for lunch. 20 hikers with their packs lining the walls of the billiard room, all ready to eat. The cook was distressed. He came out several times....""y'all jest have to be patient!! "" I hadn't heard anyone complaining though. We were all happily chatting and the food was worth the wait. The last 2 seats in the bar/eating area were with boulder dash and viper. Boulder dash was on his very last section after 9 years. Viper was waiting for his daughter who would hike with him for 2 weeks. He was southbound and was worried how his daughter would do getting out of town. I told him it was mostly steps and the 11 miles had taken us only 5 hours. Some people were staying at The Doyle. We had decided if we were going to stay in town we wanted more luxury than the sagging ceilings of The Doyle offered. We called the red carpet inn and they picked us up after we finished laundry in town.At the hotel we saw Jonny and Abby, 2 Mainers who we haven't seen since Fontana Dam.

Iceman who we met hiking in Erving TN had been following us on trail journals. He contacted us and offered a day of slack packing. He drove 40 minutes out of his way before work to get us going on the trail and would stay in contact throughout the day and arrange a drop off time and place for our packs after work. In addition he left trail magic for everyone at a road crossing as Pennsylvania is famous for not having much water. He left water and soda for everyone.Always appreciative of such generosity I didn't know how much I would need it today. The hike out on Duncannon is steep and rocky. There were many places I was so happy not to be carrying my fully loaded pack. One step was quite scary even. Poor footing, poor hand hold, around a corner with a 5 ft drop. Yikes! Also, it rained with blowing wind all morning. It had been cool and damp since I woke up and I had my rain coat on from the start. It was probably in the 50's and 60's all day. We stopped at each shelter for a break and some visiting, but we had planned extra miles today since we were slack packing, we kept going . Originally we were to hike 11 miles to a shelter. We were able to hike 16 slack packing and then 3.1 more miles to get to a camp site uphill with our full packs.Everything worked out as planned. We arrived at the drop off spot as predicted. Bombadil and iceman drove away just as I was getting to the parking lot. His wife Mrs. Iceman was staying with our packs and waiting for me. They had gone off to get icecream. Bombadil brought me back some moose tracks ice cream, a favorite flavor of mine. After enjoying that tasty treat they drove away and we hiked our last 3 miles. The sun had started to shine for the first time today as it neared the evening horizon. The wind was still blowing turning the leaves of the striped maples along our path. The glitter of the rain still sparkled all around in the dappled sunlight. The world all around was beautiful.We were aiming for a tent site that had chair made out of stones. We got there at 8pm. It was quickly turning dusk. We set up our tent, threw a bear bag and ate dinner headlamps at the ready. It was still chilly and windy, but we warmed up in a short time and I slept better than I have for a long time.Today's delight. Watching the wind in the treesToday's opportunity for learning. Sometimes magic appears for you and you don't even know how much you are going to need it.","duncannon

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537536,"June 9th. We woke up at our beautiful campsite to a cool, crisp, clear day. The sky was blue the trees were swaying more gently. Our piney bed was soft and my sleeping bag warm. I had asked Bombadil not to rush me today since we did so many miles. He tried his best, only gentle nudges today to get going. We had hot breakfast of oatmeal. While we were cooking papa monkey and curious George came by. We asked them to sit with us for a while since we had stone ch airs for them to sit in. Papa monkey is a story teller. He told us in the short time he was there about his night argument with a hiker, his daughter and a secret family recipe. Curious George was quiet. We got underway at 10:00 with 15 miles planned for the day.   Last night we had to carry extra water as there was none near our planned tenting area. This morning the first water was a 20 minute hike down the trail. Many people had gathered there to collect the water for hiking today. I still had enough that I carried up the hill so I went ahead. I leap frogged with papa monkey and curious George the rest of the morning. We hiked passed yellow spring which had been a settlement and had a grassy meadow to take a break and have a snack. We met lucky dog and his 2 companions who were sitting on a log. Bombadil caught up at that time and we hiked most of the day together.It remained a perfect day for hiking. The sky stayed blue, the breeze gentle and the temps barely 70'. The terrain was never very difficult. People complain about Pennsylvania rock, but I have not been troubled by them yet except in very short sections. Toward the end of our hike we happened upon some lovely trail magic. Waiting 2015 had left a cooler of drinks with a whole watermelon sliced on top and a bag of oranges and a bag of apples. I loved the watermelon!! While stuffing our faces we met super tramp Alexander. He had met Legs and Verge. That is always exciting for us to hear. He had hiked many miles today and his feet were hurting. We told him we were camping at a tent site three miles on. He wasn't sure if his feet were up for it. We gathered extra water again at a stream while super tramp soaked his feet. We would have to carry the extra weight 3 miles again. Uphill again.Other than getting tired at the end of the day and having a 1 mile climb at the end it was a great hike. We arrived at camp at 6 pm along with super tramp, Kenya, and Otter who signs his name with a peace sign. We set up the tent in a flat spot, thew the bear bag and cooked by a nice fire with good company while eating dinner.Today's delight. A perfect day of hiking Today's opportunity for learning. Relaxing in the morning is nice.","tent site

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537615,"June 10th. We got up and going with breakfast drink on the go by 7 am. As we were packing up camp a southbound hiker said, "" there is a bear! About 2 hours back. It was big. It stood up at me."" We were like, ""cool."" After seeing 11 bears on the trail, but he was shaken by the experience. ""Well, I'm alive. He didn't eat me. "" he said.I gave away my extra water to Kenya and left while Bombadil yogied some coffee off of him. We started the day by finishing the hill we started last night. The first half hour was a gradual uphill. Then the rest of our 11 mile hike was a ridge hike with not much elevation change. It is another amazingly beautiful day. Blue sky, cool air, light breeze. The terrain was even except for 2 short sections of rock hopping that wasn't too difficult. 7 miles in we stopped at the William penn shelter. Super tramp was there taking a break. We had an early lunch and read the register before moving on. We had 4 miles more to go on pretty easy terrain arriving at 501 shelter at 1:00. Bombadil was calling it a nearo day, but it was too many miles for me to qualify it as nearo. The 501 shelter is a unique enclosed large bunk room with a huge sky light illuminating the room with natural light. There is a solar shower. Unfortunately, the solar shower is in the shade so it is a very chilling experience showering there.After my shower I couldn't warm up. I tried my sleeping bag and I tried eating hot food. Finally, I convinced Bombadil to start a fire. It ended up being a joint effort. He is superior at collecting fire wood and I started a flame.One of the reasons we had a short day was to stay at the 501. It is a shelter where pizza delivery is available. Early afternoon we ordered ours. We both ordered a large pizza. I also wanted a salad and ginger ale. I managed to eat half of the large salad, saving some for anyone who might want it later, 3 slices of pizza and almost all of a 2 liter bottle of ginger ale. I could drink more if there was any left. When we first arrived there were people staying for lunch, corncob, gentle Ben, and snap as well as 2 southbound hikers in for a very short stop. They all left then the evening crew came in mountain goat, chopper, curious George and papa monkey. Some of them braved the cold shower and we're glad the fire was already started. They all had ordered pizza by the end of the night. Zack galifiniakis and Future dad stopped in for a break, both lured by the warm fire and pizza, but they do long miles. They would head out again soon. We quizzed future dad, who stayed longer, on whether he had seen legs and verge. No luck, he had not.Today's delight. A short day with pizza involved.Today's opportunity for learning. Have Bombadil collect the wood.","tent site up a hill by 81

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537817,"June 11th. Today is our 3 monthaversary hiking the Appalachian trail. Just today we passed the 1200 mile marker. We woke up very early. We were worried about rain predicted at 1 pm and the continuing saga of the Pennsylvania rocks. ""They are bad right after the 501."" Say the southbound hikers. Well, that's where we are. Rain and rocks are a famously bad combo making terrain slippery and dangerous. We had 15 miles to the next shelter, so an early start was in order. I kept looking at my weather app on my phone. There wasn't even a cloud, where would the rain come from. I was the first one packed and out. Bombadil told me the quickest way to the trail which promptly got me lost. I milled around a bit and texted Bombadil that I was lost until I found the trail. At that point curious George was out and hiking. Bombadil responded, ""are you found yet?"" I replied, ""curious George found me."" We spent the next 3 hours together in pleasant conversation until Bombadil and papa monkey arrived and we naturally switched to our regular hiking partners.The first 2 hours out of 501 were indeed more difficult and tiring. 2 hours of rock hopping. When I woke up this morning my feet were swollen. They didn't hurt. I told curious George I didn't know if it was the rockier terrain or the pizza and soda, but I have fat feet this morning. We were comparing shoes. We both have trail runners, Softer and more flexible to increase agility, but not enough cushion perhaps. The four of us hiked together until the 6 mile mark then I stopped for water while everyone else went on. I spent the rest of day enjoying the scenery. It was another mountain laurel day. Reaching 20 feet into the blue sky the white flowers still in full bloom. So beautiful. The ferns glowing a yellow green in the sunlight. The sun sparkling on the water. The weather was near perfect. The sky was blue. The air was fresh but hot 90' today with no humidity. The breeze was blowing. The day rolled by.   I saw lucky dog and cheesy reverse slack packing. They let us know we had trail magic ahead. Mountain goat, and chopper passed me. While at the trail magic spot I met soup who is carrying a hub cap that has travelled with many different hikers on different trails all over the world each have signed the hub cap. It is a treasure. Bunkie who has met legs and verge arrived with sponge bob. They are both struggling with motivation but keep each other going. They are staying at a hostel tonight. 5 miles to go. My feet were getting tired and the terrain was stumbly but I got to the turn of for the shelter in good time and stopped for water at the spring then continued to the shelter. Bombadil, curious George, papa monkey, toiling midget, mountain goat and chopper, soup and a new Canadian were sitting around 2 picnic tables. New Canada has just started in boiling springs so everyone is eager to give advice. The afternoon is relaxed and the rain never comes.Today's delight. All the world around me.Today's opportunity for learning. Follow the blazes.","501

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538458,"June 12th. Oh boy!! Bitter sweet day today. In April 2015 I applied for a 6 month leave of absence from work. I got 97 days. Last night was my last night on the trail. This morning my last day of hiking. I started to say good bye to hikers I knew I wouldn't see again a few days ago. ""My hike is over on Sunday. I have to go back to work. "" I would say. Most people congratulated my on my accomplishment, 1200 miles. I gave hugs to anyone who would take them. When I told papa monkey he said why? So I reply, "" to exchange labor for money."" Why? He asks again. ""To exchange money for goods and services."" Why? He asks. "" I need a massage,"" says I. And so the conversation went for a while longer. Why indeed!! Why must I return to work. Bombadil and I discussed me leaving my job. I was told I would be hired back...but. It just didn't seem wise for our family. I didn't sleep well. I had discussed with curious George if he thought we were safe under the 4 dead trees he and I were set up under. It had made him nervous enough to move, but I stayed. At 4 am the wind was blowing. I watched as the trees swayed. I was packed and out at 6:30 just behind curious George. We had 9 miles into town. It was another beautiful day. Temperate and breezy with mountain laurel surrounding us we hiked on rocky terrain with little elevation change until down into town. There was a 1 mile steep descent into town on a dry dirt path with stone steps every few feet. We emerged at a rail road track/ depot/ park into the tiny town of port Clinton. Arriving at a post office drop on Sunday bought us a night in a hotel. I had ordered a car for Monday, but as we were eating at our all day breakfast restaurant I tried to call for an early delivery. They are closed on Sunday, we had to do all our errands on foot. While we were eating we tried to figure out how to get to the hotel in the next town. The woman next to us overheard and offered a ride. We bought her breakfast and went to the microtel.Once we were checked in and laundry done Bombadil and I walked across the highway to the nations largest cabela's. We didn't have much to get but we spent plenty of time wondering around the giant store. It was an overwhelming experience. We headed to do other shopping and find dinner. This shopping complex is quite large. We found an all you can eat Chinese buffet. After I had eaten 3 plates of food Bombadil said,"" if I had known you were going to eat like a normal person we could have gone somewhere else. "" I just laughed. I don't know where else you can go for 3 plates of food for $11.99 including a steak on the hibachi grill. When we got back to the hotel I went to the pub. They had Guinness beer. I sat with curious George and enjoyed his company and good beer as did Bombadil when he arrived. Today's delight. My last 9 miles, every minute. The sunlight on flowers. The rocks. The smell of the air.Today's opportunity for learning. It's good to end on a good note. The last week has been fantastic. I'm glad to feel this way on my last days.","eagles nest shelter

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538459,"June 13th. The day was complicated. I still hadn't arranged the car pick up time and Bombadil wanted a slack pack day and the mail drop at the post office wouldn't open until 12:30 pm. I ended up sending Bombadil ahead and told him I would take care of everything. He picked a drop off spot for his bag 10 miles out.I called for the car as soon as they were open at 7:30. They wouldn't be able to get me until 10:30. I was disappointed and a little stressed, but check out wasn't until 12:00 and the post office also would be a big delay anyway.Finally, I checked out and was on my way to get the car. While at the car rental place iceman saw me as he was driving by and came to tap on my window for one last goodbye. It was so sweet of him to stop. I drove back to the hotel to look for someone to drive around. No one was hanging out so I went back to 3c's restaurant to have lunch and get Bombadil a sub for his lunch while waiting for my last chore, the post office. I did find someone to help while at the post office. I drove a couple and their dog back to the microtel then went to find Bombadil. After leaving at 5:30 am he had slack packed 10 miles to eckville shelter. After going through his pack and resupply he gave me all his trash, ate his sub and kept hiking. I then was on my way to see Legs and Verge for Legs's birthday week. Time to go spoil the girls.On my 2&1/2 hour drive south I saw a farmer's signs for juicy peaches and fresh picked strawberries. I was tempted by the signs and decided to sidetrack to the farm stand. It was so worth it. David young was wearing and AT tshirt. I purchased a large bucket of very juicy peaches. As we were chatting I told him my plans were to give them all away for trail magic. He then offered me a large flat of fresh strawberries that had gotten wind burned the day before. He said he couldn't sell them, they were no longer shiny. They did however taste wonderfully sweet. The sweet berries were sure to please. He then ran into his house to give me some runt sweet potatoes he wasn't selling for the hikers.I picked up Legs and Verge without a hitch. We went in search of food and lodging and had a wonderful evening together.Today's delight. Smothering the girls with kisses and seeing their sweet smiles.Today's opportunity for learning.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538460,"June 14th. Legs and Verge slept in. I went to hotel breakfast. The quality inn in Waynesboro PA. Has the best continental breakfast on the trail. They don't have anything extra special, but they have everything. Waffles, hard boiled eggs, premade omelet, yogurt, cereal, toast, donuts, juice, tea and coffee, fresh fruit. I'm sure the Patel's think their patrons will have a donut dipped in coffee and be on their way, but then there are hikers....lol. Yep, one of each. The girls showed up and did the same.We were a little slow getting out of town, but I had trail magic packed in my car and the girls had their new slack packs on ( Verge a panda and Legs a robot backpack. I got a unicorn purse) and on the trail by 10. I went to PenMar park ready for magic at 10:30. My first customer was at 11:30. I had a large group come by for lunch and was busy the rest of the day I think between 30-50 hikers sat with me during the course of the day. Some familiar faces appeared, El Tehano, Conundrum, Aurora, from day 1. White cap and braids I had given a ride to yesterday when I picked up Legs and Verge, the compact car was packed!!! Once Legs and Verge arrived to be hostesses I started to give rides to Walmart. I made 4 trips ferrying hikers to resupply. I had let trail angel Vicki know when we would be there so I could finally meet the Real Deal. She was sweet to come and see us again. She brought pie and fudge a real hit with the hikers. I brought strawberries, peaches, chips and soda, sweet potatoes and toilet paper. The peaches were the real hit of the day. The sign that lured me was right. They were perfect and juicy, soooo good. I stayed at the park until 7 pm even Though I was out of goodies by 5 pm. Some hikers had stayed to order food delivery. At 7 it was time to find the girls.I found the parking area where I was supposed to wait, but I had just passed a park with a bathroom so I went back. While I was parking the girls popped out of the woods. They used the facilities and popped back into the woods for the last mile. They would be done in 20 minutes.We were all very hungry. We went back to Waynesboro to Waynesburger restaurant. All three of us ordered a falafel platter and enjoyed it thoroughly with baclava for dessert.Today's delight.

I had hoped to provide a grilled meal for trail magic, but the persistent rain was discouraging. Legs and Verge made a plan for drop off and a place to pick up. I left them on the trail at 10:30. Then went to Walmart.I kept checking the weather. It seemed as though the rain should stop soon so I continued with my plan for grilling. Walmart as always was large and maze like. I circled the store several times collecting everything I would need for a cook out. I didn't make it out of Walmart until 11:45 then to Caledonia park to set up. I found a perfect spot under a pavilion with a grill and a white blaze right next to it.I felt anxious at first because it was getting late. Just as I was setting up I saw the first hiker that I did yesterday. He had already eaten at a restaurant. Well, that was disappointing. I had bought poster board to put up a sign. I hurried to put it up hoping others wouldn't eat out. At a another pavilion I met el tehano and viper with his daughter. I dragged them to my pavilion and the fun began. I saw many of the same hikers as the day before. By the end of the day I had given out 23 hamburgers and 16 hot dogs and 8 veggie burgers with all the fixings, a bag of apples and a bag of oranges. Everyone was full and happy to have food and rest. Visiting with everyone was also quite fun. Most people were just going 3 more miles so they all felt at ease to not rush out. We played card games and just chatted. At 4 pm Legs called and said they wanted an earlier exit than planned. I packed up and disposed of trash with help from many hikers help. I had left over food that I didn't want to take with me. I found a local and gave the rest away.By the time I got to the meeting place they would be arriving any moment. Legs arrived first looking good, then Verge. She was crying. She had complained about not feeling well for two days. Today she hit the end of her endurance. She was feeling feverish and achy. ""I guess I want to go to the emergency room."" She said. I felt pins and needles all over my body with worry. We took our time going to the Hospital. We ate and took showers preparing for a long night in the ER. Our 4 hour stay included blood work and IV fluids. In the end they found nothing wrong and decided to treat her symptoms as Lyme.

When we got back she was upset with us for letting her sleep through breakfast hour, but she went and got some food. We had a very slow start getting to the trail at 12:00. They had a 12 mile hike planned to pine grove furnace. It was a day for the half gallon challenge.When dropping them off mud puppy and murph stepped out of the woods wanting a ride to pine grove, such good timing. We headed to the general store. El Tehano, Aurora and conundrum were already at the pine grove general store. I sat with them all afternoon until Legs and Verge arrived. We watched many of the hikers I had met over the last 2 days successfully complete the half gallon challenge which is eating a half gallon of ice cream at the half way mark. Everyone had just passed the official half way marker that morning. Legs and Verge arrived at 4 pm. Legs was happy to be there and easily talked into completing the challenge. She and sweets went at it and finished with no problems. Verge showed up tired and achy somewhat subdued. She had a small ice cream as did I as we watched the gluttony chuckling as they began to shiver with cold and their lips turned blue. I offered my down coat to Legs as she continued bravely on. She was still smiling.Once they completed the challenge we left to find new lodging and believe it or not Legs wanted food. We ate at the Holly Restaurant and motel. We all like it here.

We honor our children's arrival so much in our culture seldom is it thought it's really a day for moms. I celebrate you because you changed my life. We got up and ready to go. Breakfast out at Laura's restaurant. Our food was very good, but the building was tricky. It looked closed with no one there. The driveway was blocked with traffic. When we got to the back of the building we found it is the locals best kept secret. It was packed. I thought the girls were on track to have an early start for their 20 miles, but they repacked their bags in the pine grove general store parking lot. After many, many hugs and kisses, along with the suggestion that Verge consider coming home with me, the two left and disappeared down a hill before I could blink my eyes. I still had a plan for a special treat for Legs. Her new plan was to camp in the Boiling Springs camp site. I drove to Walmart and arranged for more trail magic. I got cupcakes, ice, water, cherries, chips, a blanket to sit on and bubbles then drove the goodies to the campground. I also made a card. She said everyone waited until she arrived to dig into the birthday treats. Her friends also took her to the tavern for her first Guinness.Now it was time for me to finally disengage. I programmed my gps. Home. It felt weird. I'm going home. As luck would have it my eldest daughter would be there. I would be looking at and holding each of my three children in the same day. That was my treat for the day. The drive home was as uneventful as any 7 hour trip. Traffic, 25 mph for an hour or 2. The grace I had developed walking through the woods for 3 months began to fall away as I jockied for my spot in traffic. I arrived safely. The house was clean, but stale air was around me. It didn't feel like home. My neighbor had been collecting my mail. 3 boxes filled with mail as well as 4 packages sat on the kitchen counter. I had only missed the water bill and it looks like jury duty is in my future. Those were my only 2 surprises so far. I still have another box to go through. My neighbor also watered my plants and all but 1 looked quite healthy. I was also informed another of my neighbors passed away this week. She was so sweet. I am sorry I missed the end of her life. She had spent last summer doing her genealogy for her family. Adrienne arrived shortly after me and announced she had a surprise outside. It was a person surprise. Her husband Jay was in town for his grandmother's funeral. I am sorry for his loss as well, but so glad to see our BFG, safety hero, Jay. We spent the evening returning the rental car, sipping on beer and telling stories. His flight home was early in the morning, so it was not a late night. He was gone when I woke.Today's delight. Loving, hugging, kissing each of my 3 children all in 1 day, and Jay to.Today's opportunity for learning. The world has continued here without me. People have died.

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541105,"July 6th. As I mentioned reentry included jury duty. I was fortunate that it was not an all day affair. Hoping that it would not be I planned for a 3 day hiking adventure. As soon as I was released I headed to Stratton VT. Bombadil and I had done a winter training hike from North Adams MA to Stratton last November. I thought I would start from where I left off. I found my way to Arlington-Stratton road to a nice AT parking area and began.My heart was elated. I was so happy to be back in the woods. I did not expect the hardest thing for me about reentry would be that I felt claustrophobic, especially at work. The beige walls, still air and windowless area with bad industrial art is most uncomfortable. 2 days is not quite enough for a long hike, but 3 days is. The hike up Stratton is very moderate for a 1500 foot climb. I didn't know how I would do after so little activity for 3 weeks. Day 1, 14.8 miles I did ok. Tired at the end, as always.This hike was special to me. I am hiking alone. My last 1200 miles was with Bombadil. I was never afraid even hiking by myself, but I really was with someone. Now I am really alone. What will it feel like to be in the woods by myself. I told my friends that were worried about me the trail would be filled with through hikers and not to worry. This helped stave off any fears for me as well. Truthfully, there is not a very big bubble in Vermont yet. I have only met 2 through hikers, but there are plenty of section hikers out. I did notice as I was packing for the trip I kept stalling, I was behind in getting ready and I know in my heart that was fear.My first step on the trail I set out some apples for trail magic. And I met Adventure who started in Virginia and is planning to flip flop. I was a little worried about the weather. All the way on the radio temperatures were projected to be in the mid 90's, not my favorite hiking weather. It turned out to be a very beautiful day. I was just so happy to be outside. Stratton has a lovely tower on top built in the 30s. It is over 50ft tall and stands above the tree line for great views. Even with the tower the mountain is just under 4000 ft. The tower has a register and I saw that I missed cool dad by 1 day. It would have been fun to see him. I'm still hoping he went to Manchester for a day and our paths will cross. At Stratton pond shelter I met blue feather and daisy lashers ( long ass section hikers). Wikipedia and Kate, and Julia hiking the length of the Long trail having serious boot issues. Blue feather has an incredibly loud voice and likes giving advice. Julia was definitely looking for advice and I agreed with and verified his tips. We both recommend trail shoes for her and I showed her my 600 mile saloman shoes. It looks like she has ten pound leather boots. She said they were 10 years old. I told her the story of my hiking feet.2 years ago I would have told anyone my feet were 9.5 shoe size. Last year we hiked 300 miles in preparation for a though hike and I settled on size 10. Taking advice from books about getting ready I went up even more and am now wearing 10.5 shoe size. I have been very happy with my shoes and as I have bragged before only had 1 blister on day 3 of my hike ( not in these shoes).The 5 of them invited me to stay with them. We would do a shake down on Julia's pack, but I have a plan for pick up and needed to keep going to the next shelter 3 miles along. Where I met David, Nancy, scarf, and Trevor. The spring has beautiful water. I decided to tent. I haven't camped much with this tent, but I got it up just before dark and I spent a full hour on the phone with a friend I have yet to reconnect with after my hike. As we talked I watched the sun set and the bugs come out. There hadn't been many bugs during the day.As a side note, I finally did it!!! Even with a tent and stove my pack weighed 29# headed out of the house.Today's delight. I'm back in the woods and it is wonderful here.Today's opportunity for learning. I forgot a lighter. Oops, pack a lighter. But there are generous people everywhere. I now have some matches.","home

Trevor, as it turns out, is not with them. He is a 15 yr old hiking the long trail by himself. His parents are supplying him along the way. I was ready to go at 8:30. I had some very lofty plans to hike 18 miles, but I didn't have to if I didn't feel like it later in the day. It was a pretty day, but many complained, it was too hot and humid. One hiker said it was his worst day on the trail. He looked like a strong hiker, but I couldn't help but think he hadn't been hiking long if this was the worst he had seen. After leaving spruce shelter I crossed many little brooks and streams babbling away a symphony over the weather worn rocks. I crossed the road that was supposed to have a campsite and water, but I didn't see it. I started to climb bromley. It was similar to Stratton mt. The trail was moderate for such a big elevation change. Bromley shelter was 3/4 of the way up. I had meant to stop for water but I forgot. I almost went back, but who goes back... There had been tons of water all morning and Stratton has a lovely spring right at the top bromley probably does to.7 miles. I went 7 miles with zero water. Well, that was my own fault. 3 hikers passed me, but they had been caught unaware of the lack of water in this area as well and didn't have spare. Despite the lack of water I was still in good spirits and hadn't hit any kind of wall yet. I just kept at it. Very near the next shelter was a spring right in the middle of the trail. I sat there for over half an hour chugging 2 liters and filling up more than I could possibly need in the next 4 hours. At the shelter I sat with a fellow from Worcester Massachusetts. He and I had a lively conversation while I sat and prepared my supper and ate. After a relaxing and filling meal I had to seriously consider what I was going to do next. I was tempted to stay, the company was pleasant, there was room in the shelter, it was going to rain somewhere between drizzle and buckets. I finally resolved to tear myself away from good sense and hike 5 more miles. The forecasters had lied all day rain at 10, rain at 2, rain at 5 etc., etc. and I wanted an easy day tomorrow during which it might also rain and I had a deadline for pickup ending my 3 day hike. So off I went. It did start to sprinkle right away, but stopped. When I reached a clearing I was a little worried about the clouds as they growled at me. It sounded like airplanes in the sky that never stopped. I was VERY fortunate to get over a bald granite, slippery when dry jagged incline...still nervous with the rumbling, peak. Moments after finding shelter in the woods it rained. It rained very hard. I still had my parasol. Lol. My head stayed dry. It was a little hard to maneuver as there were many downed trees. I was still hoping to arrive at the shelter before dark. With the rain clouds it was hard to tell how much daylight was left, but time wise I still should have been ok.I think I started to get scared. I started singing lullabies. Maybe I was just tired. 17+ miles and I was there. What I didn't expect was that it was packed!! Tents, hammockers, and a rousing game of dice being played in a packed shelter. It stopped raining when I arrived. Everyone in the shelter agreed to make room for me. It is listed as an 8 person shelter, but really it's 6. We made 7 fit. Thank goodness for tiny 15 year old Trevor. He volunteered to sleep in the back of the shelter. He said he slept great???Today's delight. WaterToday's opportunity for learning. Don't take water for granted.","vermont

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541491,"July 8th. I was achy all through the night. Any time I woke up I tried to do some stretches just to stay loose enough to be able to move in the morning. Also, it's hard not to be conscious of the shoulder to shoulder- try not to disturb your neighbor -roll overs that happens during the course of a night. I was complimented in the morning for not rustling too much on my neoair mattress. The sun rises early, as do hikers. People started moving about between 5 and 5:30. The early hour doesn't bother me. What surprised me was a leisurely morning ending at 7:30. I had just over 11 miles planned. I was definitely more tired today. I wouldn't say I struggled, but I sure did take a lot of breaks and I ate a lot of my snacks early in the hike. As I approached forest road 10 I met a mushroom collector. This was his main source of income and we had a very interesting conversation about mushrooms and trying to live off the grid. He also told me the rainbow gathering was on forest road 10. It had ended 3 days ago, but he assured me it takes a couple weeks to clean up and fun could be had if I stopped by. I didn't end up going, but I was hoping ,yet again ,maybe cool dad had stopped and I would get my chance to say hello after all. I did stop at the parking lot to try and dry off. Shoes and socks came off, food bag emptied on the parking lot for snacking. Becky and Amy who I had met at breakfast that morning saw me and joined in the drying and snacks. They are from Maryland for a section hike ending at killington.I was slow starting again. I almost fell asleep, but a concerned citizen asked if I was okay passed out in the middle of my exploded bag in the middle of a parking lot. Not a bad question, but that got me moving again. The next feature was rocky pond. It left me wishing there had been a way for me to stay there. It was so picturesque. A quintessential New England pond with a little tiny forested island just off center. Becky and Amy had just gone for a swim. I was tempted, but I was hiking so slowly I was worried about my pick up. 6 more miles to go with a mountain to take down on the way, and my feet were starting to hurt.The incline wasn't too bad, but my feet never dried and the mud after rain was ever present. The great thing about white rocks cliff trail is it has a beautiful rock garden with happy little rock beings built up over quite a large area. I visited here for a while before my final descent. It was steep and rocky at times with plenty of mud on the way down. But there were some beautiful water features. In the last mile I stopped at a lovely waterfall. My parents were already waiting for me at the bottom so I hurried down the last bit. They were in their camp chairs reading next to a stream and very happy to see me completing my first solo trip. I got some good hugging in then soaked my feet in the stream while cleaning my shoes and socks. My dad offered me his camp chair to sit in the middle of the stream. It was a good set up. I had been dreaming of soaking my feet for a while, but I did want to do it to soon and have even wetter soggier feet than I did already and still have to hike. So, everything was perfect. We went to Sals for pizza and we found my car an hour and a half away. As we drove along the ridges of Vermont my mom said, ""wow, it looks like you hiked a long way."" I did.Today's delight. I just love ponds and waterfalls. They were everywhere along the trail.Today's opportunity for learning. There are not that many mosquitos, but there are kamikaze black flies that aim for the glistening whites of your eyes that I haven't found a solution for.","lost pond

Goldberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550471,"October 14. It rained last night. In my fantasy world a friend and I would leave for Vermont and hike for 3 days. She cancelled. Real life happened. Appointments and meetings crept up, it rained. What I got was a Friday hike. In Vermont it is about 3 days passed peak foliage, which means it's insanely beautiful everywhere you look. What it means to rain 3 days passed peak is that the trail is obscured by the colorful leaves. I didn't really mind. I was so happy to be out, I just had to be more vigilant not to stray from the trail. In my ambition to get out I had imagined I would be up and out by 5 am. From my warm cozy bed that hour and the next went sweetly by. I drove 2 1/2 hours to the trail singing all the way. My spirit so lifted, a clear bright October sky above me, the trees with their luminescent leaves littering the trail below me, the hillsides rolling with orange leaves around me, I hit the trail at 10am. Bombadil had said I might meet some southbound through hikers. I dropped off some trail magic just in case. About an hour in I met queen. She is from north Carolina hiking the long trail. Her husband was meeting her tonight to finish the last 75 miles. She was very sweet to spend some time chatting and said she hadn't met with any trail magic yet. Due to my ever changing plans, I didn't really make a plan. I didn't even look at a map. I knew where I had stopped last and headed there. Worst case scenario I would hike 3 hours in and 3 hours back to my car. The original plan my parents would pick me up, but I had told them I wasn't going hiking. I spent most of the day without cell service. I got to the Marion shelter and a fellow from CT was setting up a tent intending to stay the weekend with friends. I asked if he had cell service and he obliged by checking, but no. After I stopped for lunch it was almost time to turn around. I was headed up a hill so I thought I would check one more time and call mom and dad. SCORE!!! Cell service, they were home, and yes, they are coming for a 2 hour pick up!!! Yay!!!I met quadzilla. He wasn't interested in chatting.The best news was the next road was 103, Clarendon gorgeous where I happened to do trail magic for legs and verge this summer. I was so happy to get there. It took me about an hour and a half which left plenty of time for exploring and pictures. The time flew by and I had just decided to make sure my parents weren't waiting for me in the parking lot when they appeared. We took more pictures and then went for pizza and beer. It was about a ten minute drive to my car.....   Those things sure can cover some territory quickly.My ride home was just as amazing as the rest of the day. The setting sun sent a warm glow to the already warmly colored hillsides, but what took my breath away was the moon. As I was driving into Keene the October full hunters moon was cresting the horizon over monadnock with the rolling foothills magnificently orange and the sky greeting the moon with the blue turning to pink. It took my breath away. It took my breath away.Today 's delight. Too numerous to count. Today was a delight. Highlights: singing, leaves, hiking, My uncle Pat's hiking stick he made for me, water, air sky, moon, sun, hills just the right size, parents.Today's opportunity for learning. I might have wanted 3 days, but what I got was pretty good.","140
