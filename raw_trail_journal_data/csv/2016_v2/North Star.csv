North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511271,"When I was thirteen years old, all I wanted to do in the world was hike the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. It consumed much of my thought through reading and actual hiking. Over the years, circumstance led me away from that goal. Work, marriage, and family have brought me to my 53rd year happy and healthy, but with that lifelong dream un-fulfilled. My desire to hike the A.T. has never waned and in fact, watching my close colleague and two of my students successfully make this hike, it has grown into a bit of an obsession. This summer, I have taken two “practice” trips, one for three days and one for seven.   I have become confident in my ability to be successful and as a result, am writing you to request a discretionary leave in order to hike the entire trail beginning in the spring of 2016.This is the opening paragraph in a letter I wrote to my employer requesting an unpaid leave so that I might make my thru hike beginning next March. When I submitted it, I wasnt sure if I would be more pissed if they said no, or terrified if they said yes. This evening I sit on my couch, watching the Red Sox work to lose yet another game this year, and write my first entry in this journal. They said yes! It's my intention to keep this journal to the end. To share a big time adventure with friends and family. To maybe benefit some other future hiker with a story or a tip. To learn from my trail classmates and those who have gone before me. To document highs, lows, fears, hopes, and dreams. Ill try to keep it interesting so follow along!",,Leave Granted,"Aug 24, Mon",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511276,"My nephew did 1600 miles of the trail this summer. I met him in Killington, VT and we did a three day hike over to Hanover, NH in June. This completed the AT in Vermont for me. Three days and 45 miles. Two 15 mile days and a 16.6. Not bad for the first trip!",,"3 day trial, Vermont 6/2015","Aug 24, Mon",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511277,"My second trial was a seven day trip from Williamstown, MA to Salisbury, CT. I covered the 95 miles in six and a half days. Short day was Day 1, 9.6mi from Rte 2 to Mark Noepel Shelter over Mt Greylock. Longest day was 18 plus from Kay Woods Shelter to Upper Goose Pond on Day 3. These were some of the hottest days of the summer to date in New England. I dont like it in the 90s, least of all when hiking with a load all day. The dip in Goose Pond was awesome! My gear worked well and other than needing to replace my old boots after the trip, I was very happy. Ive since bought a pair of trail runners that I will use next year and this fall on a couple White Mountain hikes Im planning. My pack was about 30 pounds with four days of food not counting water. I think this is a good starting place. I have lots of questions about potential winter gear as the more I read about the peach state, the more it sounds like it could be cool for awhile!",,"7 day Trial, Massachusetts 7/2015","Aug 24, Mon",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511413,"As mentioned before, I have been hiking and backpacking since a young age. It took me some time to come to enjoy backpacking. My folks were very supportive of this interest, letting me do section hikes alone when I was fourteen years old. Trial and error led to some modest success back then. I have never loved hiking in the rain! My AT resume includes the following sections:CT/NY border to Grafton Notch, ME in six sections.Erwin, TN to Damascus, VA in one section.I have completed the Long Trail in Vermont and also hiked to the summit of all the 4000 foot peaks in NH (48) and VT (5). I intend to bag all the Maine 4000 footers I can on the trail next year.I led 28 day trips for the Hurricane Island Outward Bound School land based program in Bethel, ME in 1987.I spent four summers and two fall/winters working in the Appalachian Mountain Club hut system in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.",,Some background about me,"Aug 25, Tue",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511694,"Some other stuff I like to do includes skiing and bushwacking. While I didnt start until I was almost 18, Im an avid alpine skier. Ive spent my time on Telemark skis as well but now reserve those for backcountry use only. I must admit, I dont mind the easy ride to the summit! Sugarbush is the local area and I spend most of my free winter days there. I also enjoy bushwacking with the goal of finding antler drops (sheds) from moose and deer. These are best found in the early spring and make for a great wander in the woods. I have learned a great deal about moose and seen quite a few just by wandering around their home turf. Once I got run off a hill top by a cow moose. That was an unnerving experience but a good reminder. I have been in close proximity to many moose including some sizeable bulls (for this area anyway!). While I love seeing large wildlife up close, I have no interest in snakes or ticks! Ill try to avoid those on the trail. More later.",,Some more about me,"Aug 27, Thu",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512216,"Didnt do any hiking this past weekend, opting for fishing on Lake Champlain instead. Next weekend will be an overnight hike of Owl's Head in the White Mountains. In the Whites, there are 48 peaks over 4000 feet tall. Its a little badge of honor to have summited all of them. The AMC even sponsors the 4000 footer club and will give you a patch for doing it if you write an essay or something. Im satisfied knowing I did them and dont need a patch! About a year ago, Ann, my wife asked how many she had left to do. The answer was twelve and with a few days hikes last fall and a couple this summer, she is down to this one. It is a 17 mile round trip to bag a peak with no view and with no real trail to the top. So why not make it an overnight and try the trail runners with a load on!Ive settled on Salomon XA Pro 3D trail runners after trying three different pairs for size. I prefer the tread pattern on the 3D Ultra but of course, they are not available anywhere. Looks like a lot of thru hikers like these shoes. Here is one question for anyone who has done it. They say it is cold with snow and freezing rain in Georgia and Carolina in March. Do you use more traditional boots in the potential snowy season or just have at it in the low cuts? Does anyone use microspikes on trail runners? Does anyone bother with microspikes at all? These are important questions for someone from up this way.Have also been checking out sleeping bags. Those Western Mountaineering bags look real nice but are real expensive. Im in this new zone where I have a new lightweight pack, stove, tent, and pad. My older colder weather bags will not likely fit well in the new pack and are heavy by newer standards. Happy to have input on this as well as whether REI or Western Mountaineering ever has sales on three seaason bags and if so, when. Here is a little picture from the summit of Mt. Ellen at Sugarbush, VT, the local ski area. 182 days til I leave. Gonna be hard to wait!",,View Entry,"Aug 31, Mon",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512699,"The overnight in the Whites went very well. I used my Salomon XA Pro 3D trail runners with a pack that weighed in at 25 pounds including 2 quarts of water. Hope I can keep it to that weight next spring! The shoes were great, light, cooler than my leather boots and supported my feet very well. I added the orange superfeet and my feet are in great shape after 22 miles in a day and a half of hiking. No blistering or other significant pains. It wasnt the most rigorous of hikes. Much of the trail followed old logging railroad beds. Between the late 1800s and the 1940s, much of the White Mountains were heavily logged. The area we were in, the Pemigewasset Wilderness, fell prey to the lumber profiteers in a bad way. Today, you can see bands on the peaks where logging grades existed and many of the old railroad beds still have ties and spikes from the past. At a riverside stop, we met a young couple, Kendra and Tyson from Maine. They happened to mention that they would be starting the trail next spring on March 4. When I mentioned that I would be leaving March 2, much conversation ensued! Kendra is going to be a blogger for Appalachian Trials. I look forward to reading her stuff. Here is a picture of Ann and I on the summit of Owl's Head, the last of her 48 4000 footers in the Whites.",,View Entry,"Sep 07, Mon",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513315,"I mentioned that I have wanted to hike the AT since I was 12 years old. That a few people I know have done it recently and it is now on my mind like never before. My close work colleague is one of those. Lady Grey, my friend Deb, thru hiked the trail in 2013. We have worked together at a rural public school in Bristol, Vermont for the past 16 years. The other day in a faculty meeting, another teacher gave her this monthly Sharing is Caring award that we pass among staff members, recognizing eachother for qualities that we have, or things we do to benefit the school. If you work in public education you already know that positive recognition is rare so it is a nice honor to receive this, especially from one of your colleagues. Teri, the math teacher who gave it to Deb, cited her as being an inspiration to others to follow their dreams. While she certainly meant Deb's students (Deb and I are the High School Guidance Counselors), Teri also meant her colleagues. She couldnt have said it any better. Deb is a great colleague, always motivating me to go beyond the bounds of our small local community. Also, for covering me while I go for my walk in the woods. Well, I guess she is really just returning a favor! The picture is of she and I in the Whites when she came through. Unfortunately for her, most of the clear skies she saw in NH that June happened on that day.Speaking of A Walk in the Woods, my wife Ann and I went to see the movie today. The movie wasnt bad but it just sort of stopped in the middle. While I realize that Bryson didnt finish, the movie leaves you with no closure at all, unless of course admitting to coming from Iowa was the whole point. The movie made the hiking look easy with mellow grades and trails that revealed little root or rock. (If that is southern hiking, please let me know as that will alleviate a few concerns!) I have no idea if the movie will increase traffic next summer but if people think that hiking the trail will be like the movie, I imagine quite a few will also jump the Greyhound home part way up.My burning question for all of you who have gone before me at this point is whether I should start in a pair of more traditional boots in Georgia? It certainly sounds like I can expect to walk in snow and have frozen shoes in the morning if Im not careful. I really dont like the idea of hiking in the snow in a pair of sneakers, especially if it is slushy snow like I anticipate it would be down south. Also, what about those microspikes? I cant envision putting them on trail runners. Opinions are welcome!",,View Entry,"Sep 13, Sun",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514468,"I have become a skunk trapper. The stinking things have been tearing up my lawn throughout the summer. I have successfully trapped and released four of them and hope that theyre finally all gone. Yesterday I drove close to ten miles from home down along the ridge that goes through the Breadloaf Wilderness section of the Long Trail. Had I been thinking, I would have waited until today as I had Ann take me right back down that road to Middlebury Gap so I could do the 17.5 miles on the Long Trail north to Lincoln Gap. I hadnt done that section in a long time. The last time I did it in five hours with a day pack (that was 23 years ago!). Today, it took me a little less than eight but I did stop and chat with some other hikers, and bushwacked a little looking for mountain treasure (more on that later). It was a gorgeous day, bright sun, temp about 40 when I started and got close to 55 by afternoon. I carried about 15 pounds to start as a moderate weight with the increased miles. The hike was uneventful but beautiful. The air was very dry which was comfortable and didnt leave me feeling sticky by days end. I rolled into Lincoln Gap, after running across a friend along the way, at about 5pm.Im lucky to call this my backyard. I can walk out my back door and into the Green Mountain National Forest in ten minutes. This is a great training ground for the AT and a great place to live. I dont have to go very far to find elevation, rock, or treeline.The trail runners were great on the longer day hike. Next purchase has to be a sleeping bag. Im looking at Western Mountaineering Alpinlite, Ultralight, Feathered Friends Swift UL 20, and a Montbell Downhugger 800. Any input on these is welcome. Any input on whether treated down is important/worth it is also welcome!",,The Best time of year to Hike!,"Sep 26, Sat",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515319,"Winter weather is making its way south from Canada and we are beginning to feel it. Several recent mornings have registered as low as 32 degrees. That prompted me to harvest the basil plants last Friday and put the garden to bed for the season. Saturday dawned bright in the valley and foggy on the ridge. I opted for a day hike on a nice 12.5 mile loop just a bit down the road from here. My house sits at 1300 feet elevation so it is a nice start on any local hike. The loop I took brought me up the Cooley Glen Trail, south on the long trail for six miles, and down the Emily Procter trail. This hike peaks at about 3500 feet on Mt. Wilson. I call this section of the LT the little presidentials as there is a Mt. Grant, Cleveland, Wilson, and Roosevelt. Mt. Abraham is a bit north of here as is Lincoln Peak (Check out my photos for a nice picture of Mt Abe last Saturday).When I crested the ridge, the clouds were kissing the trees and there was noticeable rime ice on the east side. Pretty, cool, and pretty cool! I always like the first signs of winter. It holds promise of hunting, skiing and new adventures! As I progressed down the ridge, the sun came out and that rime quickly fell from the trees. While the picture just shows a little ice, the rime that dropped from the higher branches was actually half an inch thick!I am trying to wrap my head around being cold a lot at the beginning of my AT hike. Sounds like the potential for that is great. I have high hopes that all the El Nino talk will result in little to no snow and more moderate temperatures in the south in early March. Prepare for the worst and hope for the best, right? With that in mind, I decided to purchase another pair of Salomons that are mid height and gore-tex for the first few weeks. My microspikes will also fit on them if I choose to take them. When I hike in the winter, I typically wear my Lacrosse insulated hunting boots. I take great pleasure in being out in the winter when I have all the right gear to stay warm and dry. The AT will force me to compromise on that. Im optimistic that these shoes will be part of that answer! More later.",,Winter weather on its way!,"Oct 06, Tue",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516119,"This is my daughter. She's the one who thinks Im a bit nuts for taking this hike. She has a real cool job at UNC. Last weekend we went down to visit her. We had a chance to see a women's soccer game and also a football game both of which were fun. Sadly the soccer team lost to crosstown rival Duke. With a daughter at UNC and a son at Syracuse, Ive become an ACC fan for sure. Carolina is playing Syracuse at home in January. Ill have to bring two shirts for that game! While we were in NC, I had a chance to go to an REI store in Durham and check out some gear. The nearest REI to my house is about four hours away so it was a treat to find one so close to where we were. I checked out a few sleeping bags, some wool base layers, and some other little stuff. Ive settled on a Feathered Friends sleeping bag. I ordered a Swift UL20 which is on its way. A couple weeks ago I also picked up a pair of Salomon Ultra-X boots. Theyre mid height and gore-tex which I think will be a good choice in cooler, wetter, and potentially snowy weather. I also like the tread pattern with the potential of snow. I think Im down to needing the base layers, some decent gloves, a few little things, and a plane ticket. The puzzle is beginning to fit together!Not much hiking in the past two weeks other than a bushwack with an old friend. Keeping up at the gym with some regular cardio and some lower body weights. The weather is getting much cooler up here in the North Country with our first snow coming last weekend when we were away. The leaves are mostly down. The next time Ill see leaves on the trees will be somewhere in NC, TN, or VA. Strange thought! Planning on some kind of day hike this weekend to give another test run to those boots I mentioned. Hope everyone elses planning is coming along well.",,View Entry,"Oct 21, Wed",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516916,"We have had a wicked nice run of weather this week. Warm sunny days and cool nights. Highs have been to the mid 60s with some lows to freezing. My sleeping bag arrived a week or so ago so this seemed like a good week to try it out. Its a 20 degree down bag. Its fluffy, lofty, and seems like it'll be warm. I slept in it last night with high hopes of it being cooler for a real test run. Well, the bag was very comfortable but it never got cold at all with the low being 47 so I dont really know if it can keep me warm to 20 as advertised. Going to try again this weekend with forecasted temps in the high 20s after a cold front passes through tomorrow. I have a game camera posted in a spot I like at around 3000 feet. Got a few nice wildlife pictures including two bucks (Deer season starts in eight days!). A series of five pictures revealed this cow moose peacfully grazing on a sunny morning. I particularly liked this one!I think my day count is down to 117 until I start the trail. As Tom Petty says, the waiting is the hardest part!",,Indian Summer,"Nov 05, Thu",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517244,"A few nights ago I got a good chance to test drive the new bag. Temperatures were forecast in the low 30s so I pitched the Fly Creek and spent the night in the backyard again. I guess we're always kids at heart! It was a beautiful night. I jumped in about 11pm and slept until I had to get up for work. I got up once in the middle of the night to crystal clear skies and a million stars. Orion stood tall in the southern sky and the Big Dipper was standing on its handle in the northeast. My timing was excellent as I was treated to a very bright shooting star that ripped across the southern horizon for almost three full seconds. Cool! And speaking of cool, the daybreak temp was 29 degrees. I slept well but a little cool with capilene long johns and a thin fleece top. I just got a set of light weight icebreaker long johns so I imagine they will help with the warmth factor in the early sections of the trail. The coldest part was the frost on both sides of the tent fly when I took it off in the morning. I guess you dont have to worry about packing a wet tent if everything is frozen!",,Sleeping bag...

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517819,"I am a lazy deer hunter. Today marked the last of a 16 day season here in Vermont and I can say that I got out for four of them. And only one full day. So, even though I saw deer on three of those days, there is no venison in my freezer this year(they were all does or white tails running away!). My usual passion for the hunt just wasnt there. Now I must explain that I am not the kind of hunter who picks out a stand site and sits and waits for a deer to walk by. Im a walker. Every deer Ive harvested but one came while I was on foot. I cant sit still in general. So while Ive tried it, sitting in a stand all day is out of the question for me. If youre not a hunter you have to know that walking really means moving as slowly as you possibly can through the woods. Take two or three steps, have a good long look around, do it again, and again, and again... all day long. It's amazing what you see when you do this. You develop an eye for really little things. You see, smell, and hear more than you ever could hiking. Its a whole different way to be in the woods which I highly recommend. And there was the rub. I couldnt slow my mind down enough this season. It's in high gear and all of my outdoor thoughts are focused on the AT. It's been far more important to me to log some miles, test out clothing combinations, and hike in the cold and wet, imagining early March weather in northern Georgia. With the hunt on hold, I logged two good local day hikes this past weekend. Friday saw my friend Earl and I hike up Mt. Abraham and Lincoln Peak. Mt Abe is the fifth tallest peak in Vermont at 4005 feet. Lincoln Peak, just to the north, is the summit of the Sugarbush ski area. The temp was in the mid to upper 40s for this one; plenty warm for shorts. It was fun to stand there in shorts and watch skiers get off the lift and head down! Friday night the weather turned with some rain and the wind shifting from the north. A hike up Camel's Hump (4083') the next day was well below freezing with some solid ice above treeline. It was a good choice to take the microspikes as I would not have gone across the summit without them. The view was incredible with a very nice undercast! Take a look at the other picture in my photos which shows three peaks to the south poking above the clouds. Another great hike!I tried out some icebreaker wool baselayers and they worked fine. Warm when wet or dry. Thats what I love about wool. The spikes fit well on the X Ultra boots which I will start with. I do not, however, think I will bring the spikes. Im just not sure they're worth the weight. Im curious if others are planning on bringing them?My other big distraction this week was Thanksgiving. It is my favorite holiday. Heavy on the family, light on the commercialism, non-denominational, and lots of food and football! I got my boy back from college and was able to hang out with him. Everything about Thanksgiving is good in my book! I hope all of you had a great holiday as well. T minus 93 days.",,Thanksgiving,"Nov 29, Sun",0

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518391,"Life seems on hold to some degree. I think about the trail and my hike daily. I ask my wife too many dumb questions. I think I have burned Lady Grey (my work colleague and 2013 thru hiker) out with more dumb questions. I know most of the answers anyway. I have complete confidence in myself and will definitely succeed. Im totally inept and could never do this! Its like Im just waiting to see what really happens. To execute, not think. Does anyone else feel this way?Frankly, I havent even planned that much. I have spent a lot of money. I have most of my gear although Im waiting to get my REI dividend to get some last small items like stuff sacks. I figure I'll plan the first two stints in terms of how much food to carry between resupplies. First stop Neels Gap, then Hiawassee or Franklin. Is this really as daunting as most of us make it sound? Or is it just a series of four or five day hikes like a thru hiker I met last summer said? I remember the old adage, ""If you cant pack in ten minutes, you've got too much stuff!""I have a plane ticket to Atlanta on March 1 which seems like a long way off. However, after my kids go back to school from the holidays, I know time will seem very short until it is time to go! Lots to do then. Apply for financial aid, do the taxes, make sure Ann has the banking down, clean the chimney, bring in wood, gas in the generator in case the power goes out, tell the kids at my job Im going, orient my replacement, buy food for the trip, do a mail drop box for Fontana, not sleep for most of February, and finally... get out of Vermont and get this show on the road. I really cant wait to go!!It's not like its winter here or anything which I think makes it even harder to wait. Today the high was in the 50s with no temps below freezing in sight for almost a week. So what to do if you cant go skiing? Hiking of course! I did two day hikes this past weekend, an 8 mile Long Trail hike in about four hours on Saturday and a quick trip up Mt. Abe yesterday. While there I met a young woman from CT who will embark on the PCT next April. We agreed to a cross country wave. The picture is looking south to Mt Grant on the Long Trail.

We have always lived in Northern New England so the idea of hiking in shorts on Christmas Eve is (was) nothing short of preposterous. We took this short hike last Thursday to what's called Sunset Ledge on the Long Trail. Despite a stiff southwest wind, it was very warm!Hiking prep has been split between the gym and on trail. No snow cover has led to multiple hiking opportunities at all elevations. A couple days ago it was in the high 30s and raining steadily. A great day to sit around and watch the NFL. An even better day to test out clothing combinations for wet weather hiking. A seven mile r.t. hike to the Cooley glen shelter and Mt Cleveland gave me a chance to try on my new AT reality. A baselayer of thin icebreaker wool and rainjacket and rain pants was perfect while I was hiking (OK, as good as it gets once your wet). Once I arrived at the shelter things cooled down very quickly. I added a thin fleece layer for a casual poke around the ridge before heading out. I am considering adding a thin fleece vest to my clothing list for hiking in cold wet weather. I also had plenty of time to think about lots of other things I can bring to be comfortable and warm. Extra gloves, extra hats, handwarmers, maybe an electric dryer!

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520137,"When I was eleven years old, my Dad sent me to a summer camp in Bradford, Vermont. It was called Challenge Wilderness Camp. He never really gave me a choice. He planned it and one summer day drove me up there. I hadnt ever been to Vermont before and I wasnt all that excited. It was a wilderness skills camp right out of the 70s. We lived in lean-tos, cooked over an open fire twice a day (They cooked us a hot meal at lunch every day so we wouldnt starve. It probably made our parents feel better too!). We were only required to do three things when we were in camp. Do an hour of PT every morning at 7:00am, take swimming lessons, and hew an axe handle out of a peice of Ash and make an axe which we would learn to use... well. We also took trips every week. This was my first introduction to backpacking. We slept under tarps. No tents allowed. As mentioned, no stoves. All food cooked over an open fire. It was an all boys camp, slightly reminiscent of Lord of the Flies. While I was mostly miserable there, I got to visit places like Evans Notch in New Hampshire, hike on the Long Trail north of Mt. Mansfield, and canoe the Allagash in Maine. The capstone project for the month was an overnight solo. We got to take our axe, a knife, two matches, two potatoes, two brook trout, and all the clothes we could wear. We were expected to make a shelter out of logs and boughs, cut our own firewood, and build a fire to keep warm overnight. No small undertaking for an 11 year old. I froze my ass off and was hungry that night failing to get my fire going. Ill never forget that. While I cried thru much of the first summer, I went back for a second. In my thirteenth summer I asked if I could go to a hiking camp. Dad got me on a twelve day backpack trip through the White Mountains. After bagging a bunch of 4000 footers and successfully navigating trail life for almost two weeks, my interest and love of the hike was firmly and permanently ingrained in my being. I started planning my own section hikes on the AT. When I was 14, I hiked most of the 50 miles in Connecticut by myself. I also hiked all of New Hampshire ending at Grafton Notch in ME. The AT became my obsession. I read the Rodale Press books on the AT. I read the Garvey book. I also read Eric Ryback's books about his trips on the PCT and the CDT. Eric also had a chapter in the Rodale books about his AT hike. At the time he was an icon to me. At 15, I planned a 900 mile hike from Erwin, TN. When I got to Damascus, just 110 miles up the trail, I bailed. I cant really remember why now. I wish I hadn't. In five short weeks Ill start out again. I now have everything I need. It time to practice packing my pack and figuring out the food. I have a lot of respect for the folks that are already on the trail especially in light of the recent snow that fell as far south as Georgia. My daughter told me that Chapel Hill was paralyzed from three inches of snow! Here in ski country, that storm never came close. You can still find bare ground through thin snow cover at the summits. Very unusual for late January. Frankly I hope it'll all be gone by the time I get down to GA. Here is a picture from my ski day today. Had spectacular views of the Adirondacks to the west and the White Mountains to the east. See you soon!",,View Entry,"Jan 24, Sun",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520197,"How many of you have read Appalachian Trials? Ive read it twice this fall. I give credit to Badger. It is an entertaining book with a clear message. He hooks the counselor in me. Like most people, Im not one to take a close look at myself. I'd rather keep my potential shortcomings buried deep inside thank you very much! But I like his thinking.

Im working to keep it excitement rather than anxiety! Recent trail preparation has had very little to do with hiking or gear. Here are some of the highlights... I filed my taxes, I swept the chimney, I completed the FAFSA and Profile for my kid (always a thrill), I sold his car cause my wife wont drive three cars while Im gone and his wasnt reliable enough to get him to and from school. (That actually worked out OK. We netted 1200 bucks for a 17 year old car with some large rusty holes in the sides. Not bad. Of course, now he'll be driving my truck since all Ill be doing is walking. Ill figure that one out later!) Im getting things together to leave work for the remainder of the school year. Im also processing the fact that my long time colleague and friend Lady Grey (NOBO 2013) has decided to retire at the end of this year. Many thanks to her for covering for me but another unknown when I return. Hmm, maybe I just wont!Took my first hike in ahwile last Saturday. A short seven miler up Mt Abraham. While Ive been a regular at the gym, I was a little tight after that. Microspikes were required. A reasonably nice day at 15 degrees on the summit. Ive enjoyed seeing The Hiking Viking's pictures on Instagram. He appears to be a bold guy. Ive also enjoyed following Slipknot and Blizzard so far. They might have been smart starting in January. It could be colder in Georgia in March than it was then. Anyone with insight into what to expect down there in three weeks, please feel free to let me know.

Visiting kids at school seems to involve a lot of eating. If you're ever in Syracuse, check out the Dinosaur BBQ. The place is cool and the food is awesome. Go see for yourself. Too bad this place isn't closer to the trail as it would be a must stop place. It ain't cheap however. So today instead of a real hike, I opted for a five mile ""street hike"". The good thing about that in my town is we don't have much pavement so it was dirt road trekking. A decent amount of elevation gain and loss as well. I took the 21 pound base weight, added a set of microspikes, three days worth of food, a quart of water and rounded out at 30 or so pounds in the pack. It rode well over him and dale and two hours later I was home thinking this will work!Anyone who lives/hikes in north Georgia or western NC, or who is on the trail now who wants to give advice on the need for microspikes PLEASE DO!!

There were other people around too so lots of folks starting out. Left our packs there and backtracked 0.9 miles to the southern terminus.  A few pictures later we were northbound! Great to have Ranger Ray along.  Much banter and many jokes. Arrived at Hawk Mtn shelter around 2pm on a bright sunny cool afternoon. The Ranger, me,  and a Florida woman named Dream catcher decided to load up on water and wound up in Horse gap shortly after 4pm. Now there are at least 10 people camped around here. A steady breeze and temps in the 30s had us all in our tents at dark.My body feels decent after 10.5 miles,  plus 0.9. Hopefully that will be the case in the morning! I have a good attitude this evening. Far better than yesterday afternoon after no sleep the night before and traveling down.

We arrived at Woody Gap to find snow covered roads and the Twelve Tribes serving some awesome lentil sausage soup and homemade pepper bread.  It was hot and good! To make it better,  we got a ride off the gap by a wicked nice guy from Blairsville who brought us out of his way to the Hostel. After dinner it was a fun surprise to  see Kendra and Tyson. Ann and I had met them in the White Mtns last fall on a two day trip up to Owls head, her last four thousand footer in NH. A good small world experience!

Hiked through snow through much of the morning until the sun began to break through.  As soon as it did the snow literally began to disappear.Today's big event was the hike up Blood mountain. It was a modest climb that netted a fabulous view at the top! Certainly the highlight thus far. Ranger Ray, Dreamcatcher,  and I enjoyed lunch and a few pictures in the, by then, very warm sunshine! We  dropped into Neel's Gap after that, hung out a bit at Mountain Crossing,  and hiked another mile into Bull Gap where we are camped with a few others tonight. We have Jensen, Scooby, Jessica, Evan in addition to the three of us. A decent dinner,  a not so decent fire, and fun conversation capped the day nicely!

The first order of business was climbing up Standing Indian mountain. After yesterday's rough initiation to North Carolina ascents I was concerned we would have more of the same.  Not to be.  It was a very gradual walk up to the summit at 5435 feet. With the cloud cover hanging on,  and a wooded summit,  there were no views to be had. The rest of the morning and early afternoon featured similar terrain so I reached my planned destination at 12.5 miles by 2:00pm which was way too early to stop for the night. Wound up hiking another 3.7 to Betty Creek Gap and called it a day. This was the longest hiking day yet but it was fairly easy. My body feels pretty good overall.  I did develop one blister today which is very disappointing. My knees are OK and I feel like I can make good time. The weather remains good although showers and thunderstorms are forecasted for the next several days. Today I spent a lot of time figuring ways to avoid being wet. I have disliked camping in the rain since I was a kid.  You'd think the idea wouldn't bother me anymore but it still does. Maybe it bothers everyone. I have decided to go into Franklin a day early due to increased miles and potentially bad weather. I haven't quite figured out what happens after that but I guess that will come. I do not want to zero on Saturday but will need to resupply a bit and want to visit with an old friend briefly while there. Guess I'll see what happens. Last night at the shelter there were tons of people.  Tonight there are probably 14 people at this campsite. This is the seventh night I have spent with Scooby and Weatherman,  two quality young men.

This means I am packing about seven days of food and will leave Fontana with what should be the heaviest load of the entire trip. I'm glad their isn't a scale here cause I don't want to know how much my pack weighs. If all goes well we should arrive in Hot Springs, NC next Wednesday after 105 miles.  I am a careful planner and have always been sure that I have one extra layer of clothing and more than enough food.  This time I'm not so sure. It is what it is because I don't think I could put one more thing in my  pack.It has been interesting to experience an intersection of three very different groups of people here today.  There are we thru hikers,  some families,  and the car rally people. All oddly brought together in this very rural place. The rally folks are very urban people. It has been a pleasure to talk with them.  They are all very friendly.  I would never have a chance to meet them back home.  They leave tomorrow on a ride that will take them from here to Miami in some incredible cars. Tonight's picture features one of them.  If you don't know what it is, ask Grady Brokaw.There has been much talk about norovirus in the shelters. Since GSMNP requires that hikers sleep primarily in shelters,  this creates a pickle for people like me who hate feeling sick. I am hopeful that it is more hype and less fact. The weather appears ready to take a turn for the cooler in the coming days with potential for snow and below freezing temps. Guess I should be careful what I wish for!

Left with seven days worth of food so it was a long pull up hill with what I hope will be the heaviest pack I carry for the whole trip. It was another bluebird southern day with temps exceeding 60 in the valley.  This afternoon the trail took a turn to the northeast and began following the Tennessee North Carolina border.  It was exciting to touch the third state on the trip! Made good progress all day.  It definitely feels like I am in real mountains now. The ascents and descents are longer and more sustained.  The trail is well designed following contours and switching back at times so the grades are fairly consistent.  I admit I like that,  especially later in the hiking day. There is a nice group of people here  tonight including Nomadic Fish and Chalkdust, two brothers from Maryland, and also the Kentucky Cruisers,  aka Jelly Ankles and Cheetah, and their friend Corn Cob. Don't really have a plan for tomorrow other than to walk some more! Looking at a possible 17 mile day. We'll see.

One song that always gets sung is Rocky Top. Today I had the good fortune to stand atop good old Rocky Top, Rocky Top Tennessee! I never really gave much thought to that being a real place but I guess it is. Today was another beautiful weather day though I fear it may be the last for awhile. Had a great sleep last night in the tent.  Beautiful stars and a nice nighttime view of some Tennessee town in the valley below.  Got a reasonable start considering it still doesn't get light much before 7:30. Today's hiking was much more challenging than yesterday's. More direct uphill climbs made for slower going. Some nice views along the way and some bald patches I'll call them.  Areas where there is grass at higher elevations.  Rocky Top was the highlight of the day for sure.  Got a chance to hike a bit with Jelly Ankles and Cheetah.  They are two very nice young women from Kentucky. They are college friends enjoying 100 days on the trail together. In the group I'm currently traveling with I'm clearly the oldest guy.  I do seem to hold my own in terms of hiking.  There are times when it would be nice to have a peer along.

I packed as quietly as I could and was on the trail at 6:00am. It was still totally dark. There was another shelter 1.7 miles ahead so I thought I would have breakfast there. It was pleasant hiking in the dark like that.  There were several views to the west of what I assume we're the lights of Gatlinburg and surrounding towns. A few times I turned my headlamp off and looked at the lights and  the reflection off the cloud deck that was just over my head. Really cool and peaceful. I was mindful to look up the trail frequently in case there were any eyes staring back at me.  No need to meet any bears in the dark! By the time I finished eating,  it was light. I arrived at the summit of the dome in a full fog with no views at all.  I walked up the observation tower anyway and enjoyed a brief moment at the highest point the AT reaches at 6667 feet ASL.  Another milestone occurred shortly afterwards when I passed the 200 mile mark! The arrival at Newfound Gap was a real shock after my solo morning with at least 100 cars and about a million tourists.  Godspeed and Mountain Momma were offering trail magic today which consisted of two ham and cheese sandwiches,  chips, a soda and four yodels. How grateful was I! Thanks to you both.  That will be the only real food I eat for the week so much appreciated. A few rain showers and three miles later I arrived at the shelter.  There were lots of day hikers stopping by but finally Ash, Weatherman, Beans and Ben arrived along with Nomadic Fish and Chalkdust.  I was glad I wasn't the only one who opted out of going to town.

Sometime after noon it started snowing and has continued until dusk. The forecast calls for 2 to 5 inches overnight with the temperature dropping to 20. Did I mention that I am not a fan of winter camping??? The good part is I am staying in the shelter where I got a fire started which has lasted a good three hours so far. There are roughly 15 people here tonight.  It is supposed to clear overnight so sun tomorrow and I will be heading to lower elevations so it should warm up. I am currently on a seven day stint from Fontana to Hot Springs.  3 days left to go.  I believe I have enough food to make it through and am excited to get there for some real food and drink. The cell service for AT&T has been very poor lately so that explains the lack of updates. Hopefully this will improve as I exit the park.

By afternoon, in the valley,  the temp was well above freezing and sunny. As I was crossing the bridge to pass under I-40, four hikers called from a little parking lot and offered me a peice of pizza.

I left the Standing Bear with the plan to go about 15 miles.  This would have left me 18 miles to do tomorrow which would put me in Hot Springs late in the afternoon.  Some easy miles late today and one ascent in the end made it possible and have me set up for an easy day tomorrow. Another beautiful day down south.  It started on the 30s and easily made it to the 60s by afternoon.  There has to be a forest fire in the area as smoke moved in late this afternoon obscuring views and making the air quite thick. I can still smell it well after dark. Highlights of today included summiting Max Patch, a big grassy bald with excellent 360 degree views. I met Rocky on top who was doing a little trail magic.  She hiked the trail in 2013 and said she knew Lady Grey. I also caught up with some other hikers that I hadn't yet met. Today I also saw my first real game.  In the morning a little doe was hanging around the summit of Snowbird.  More exciting,  this afternoon, I spotted a young bobcat who was walking down the trail toward me!  I got a good look at both the front and back of it before it took of running the other direction.  Tomorrow will be my last day in my current boots.

I did walk through some very nice woods.  It was warm and dry which made the softwood smell very nice.

I had a thought that you come to town to eat so you can sustain your body to hike,  buy more crappy dry camp food to last enough days to get to the next town so you can eat to sustain your body to hike... repeat, repeat, repeat all the way to Maine. You get the idea. Is this trip about hiking or eating?  That is the question. I've been here for 24 hours now. I've seen the group of people just a day ahead of me head out and now there appears to be a large group of other hikers coming in from behind that I don't know.  It looks like there are a lot of them.  On the trail though I don't see all that many people during the day. The volume of people always leads me to think about pressure on campsites.  The key to it all may be to avoid towns!They're is a lot of talk about trail families.  It is clear that many of the mid/late adolescent hikers group in this way.  I feel as if I am a trail orphan.  I have gotten to know alot of hikers in the same ""bubble"" and all are very nice people.  I have tended to walk my own speed which has led me to walk mostly alone. I'm not sure if I should slow down and be more social on the trail or save the social time for camp at night. It is difficult for me to slow down. I seem to keep waiting for a contemporary of mine to show up who hikes at a similar pace so I can have a hiking partner.  I do not know if this will happen.  Sometimes I think this could do me in on the trail.  Other times I am content to travel solo. Is this a parallel for life? When I planned all of this I never thought past Hot Springs.  Well here I am.  Tomorrow I will step out into more unknown. Oddly it will look the same.  Hardwood forests,  tall fir trees, a view into a valley now and again.

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524960,"Back in October of 1984, I began a six month stint as the winter caretaker at the AMC Carter Notch Hut in the White mountains of New Hampshire.  I was a highly social guy who was headed into a scenario where I would go days without seeing other people. It was a hard adjustment to get used to this.  Ask yourself when was the last time you went 24 hours without seeing another human being. I bet for many of you it would be years. I did become accustomed to the solo life in time. However,  I remember the melancholy I would feel when I knew that the guests would be leaving and I would once again be alone. Leaving town after a zero day seems to invoke a similar feeling in me. Like in the caretaking days however,  it would usually take about a half an hour and I was back in the groove. Leaving Hot Springs today was no different. It didn't take long before the hiking groove kicked in and trail life resumed.I felt good hiking today.  Some hikers day that b you should take it easy after a zero day. I think i am of the mind that after five good meals,  I'm gassed up and ready to go. That certainly priced to be the case today. The miles b passed quickly whether they were up or down. I ran across One Feather,  Thor, and Mantis around 2 pm at a shelter 11 miles from town. I hiked with them for a short while.  They opted to camp around 3pm. I continued on and arrived at Little Laurel around 6:00 where I found Pigpen and Seam,  two other hikers I met back around Tray mtn in Georgia. They had collected some wood and had eaten dinner early so I was treated to a nice fire while I cooked. It was a pleasure to talk with them about life's challenges, hopes and dreams,  and spirituality.  There are only the three of us here tonight.

The dirty girl gaiters that my nephew Rowan gave me for Christmas add a necessary splash of color to my men in black hiking clothes. They also did a great job keeping stuff out of my shoes.  My only complaint today was some muscle pain around my knee.  I wonder if v this b is related to eliminating the superfeet insoles and sticking with the stock insert?

This morning it was the only warmth to be found. I descended Roan mtn and transitioned on to a bald ridge which included Jane Bald, and Hump mountain. Balds in the south are like being above treeline in the north. Today the temperatures were in the 40s and the wind was gusting near 50 miles an hour.  They're were many times when I lost my footing as a result of gusting winds. It was both exhilarating and anxiety producing. We had considered laying up at the Overmountain shelter only seven miles ahead.  By the time I had covered 5, I didn't think the weather bad enough to need to stop hiking at 11 am so I pushed on with the thought of making decent miles by staying at a hostel when the trail crossed Rte 19.

""Well yes please,  and one of those little apple pies and a large coffee too please."" This was a great change from the usual trail lunch and whether it was good for me or not,  it was good!It was also a good lesson for me that is ok to divert from simply making miles. Amazing what pleasure you can get from a ride on the car and fast food lunch.Despite the detour, we still managed to cover more than 17 miles today. Apparently there is some sort of hiker feed on Wautauga Lake tomorrow so we may stick around for that for part of the day. Well see in the morning.

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526316,"Well today I attended my first picnic of the year. Quick had met a woman hiking back at Indian Grave Gap who, with her family,  set up a very nice picnic for us near the Watauga Lake Dam. Since they wouldn't arrive until nearly 11:00am, we had a leisurely morning and a slow short hike to the spot.  What a treat it was. We had grilled burgers,  brats,  some awesome baked beans and lots of cookies and juice. We easily spent an hour and a half there enjoying good food and company.  Many thanks to Sarah and her family for taking the time to do that for us. What kindness! After a half day that actually felt like a weekend, we were back on the trail where we covered 14 miles to the shelter area were sleeping at tonight. You would think those would have been easy miles but they really weren't for me.  This section has been described as the Tennessee turnpike since it is basically a cruise around 4000 feet for more than 25 miles.  Hopefully tomorrow will be more as advertised than today! Today was a good lesson in not sweating making miles in favor of having a different kind of fun. It didn't really matter that I fell one mile short of my daily goal of 15 miles. I'm sure it will all work out. Tomorrow will be my last full day in Tennessee. If things go really well,  I may even step into Virginia before sunset. Today I also passed mile 438 which means I have now completed 20% of the trail but who's counting. Go Heels!","Wautauga Lake Shelter

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526505,"Well the draw of town can be strong.  At 26 miles out there was much talk about hiking all the way in to Damascus but I didn't think I would consider it. As Bob Peoples said,  the Tennessee turnpike,  the last 25 miles in TN, was easy ups and downs and a lot of flats in between.  Bob did not lie and while any up became annoying, it was a boring and less than challenging section.  I covered the first 12 miles by the 12 o'clock hour and sat for some lunch by a roadside.  I considered the next 4 miles the crux of the day and was able to cover them by about 2:30pm. It was really Large who motivated me to go the distance by telling me that he knew I would want to see the basketball game in town.  With that thought,  Dave Matthews playing,  and a snickers bar,  the thought grew and the plan became clear with each step. Let me tell you,  music really picks me up during the afternoon! My thoughts turned to being in Virginia by dark and at the state line sign,  there were Magic and White Rabbit.  They were easily convinced to go all the way in. (I'm sure it was on White Rabbits mind all along).We arrived in town about 6pm which was the good news. The bad news was that there wasn't a restaurant or bar in town that would show the game on a Monday night.  Is this town really in the United States?? I got settled in the Hikers Inn, and after a much needed shower,  found beer,  food, and friends at a local restaurant.  As for the game?  I watched on my phone in the doorway of the local outfitter,  they had chairs, using the town free WiFi. Not ideal,  and not an ideal outcome for UNC, but at least I got to see most of it. Zero day today and the temp isn't much higher this morning. In the 30s. Isn't this the south?

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527172,"As always,  leaving town after a day off is hard.  I have decided that heading out with a full resupply is one of the harder things to do in trail life.  I have also decided that the saddest sound a thru hiker can hear is the hissing of the air escaping from the valve on the sleeping pad in the morning.  It mandates an exit from the warmth of the bag and the perceived safety of the tent or shelter. The transitions seem to be the most challenging. Warm to cold, dry to wet, town to trail. But all of those create opportunity for new adventures and meeting new people.After a good diner breakfast this morning,  we climbed out of the valley and back into the hills. Being in Virginia seems different.  Frankly the woods seem more alive and varied. The hardwood forests in East Tennessee and North Carolina were often quiet and empty feeling.  Perhaps it is the promise of spring, more bird activity and buds on the trees? I hiked with Mantis this afternoon. He  is an engaging young man with passion for life.  He is thoughtful, appreciates the outdoors and I appreciated the opportunity to talk and share with him. He is also a very solid hiker. We arrived at the shelter early today after almost 16 miles.  As it is supposed to rain and be cold for the next few days,  all were hoping for shelter space but it was full of section hikers before we got here. We ate early and I actually had a chance to learn how to play Euker with Magic,  White Rabbit,  and Brandon, a section hiker from NC. He gave us the deck so hopefully we will play more. It is a great game for thru hikers as you only use half the deck.  As such you only have to carry half! It is crowded here tonight. Our little group seems to have lost our sweet spot in terms of no competition for camping space. There are around 20 hikers here tonight. Sadly,  the hiking viking passed by the shelter this afternoon without stopping in so I have missed my chance to meet him. Alas. Tomorrow on to Mt. Rogers and the Grayson Highlands.

The day began wet with rain having fallen overnight.  I packed, ate, and was off around 8am. I left well ahead of most of the shelter crowd with only a couple ahead of me. I hiked alone most of the morning climbing up towards  Mt. Rogers and the Grayson Highlands. I didn't realize how cold it was until it began snowing. I stopped to put on full rain gear. The next several miles it snowed on and off. There was a road crossing coming up and my mind wandered to the possibility that someone might have hot coffee for trail magic. It would have been perfect.  When I was coming down the hill I could see a truck parked and believe it or not,  a guy named John was actually serving hot coffee!! ... and other snacks too. It was well timed and awesome!I continued on with Thor off and on to  the Grayson Highlands. We took a short break with Santa and Wonder at a shelter then headed out in what became a wicked snow squall. The Highlands are effectively above treeline.  The wind was heavy and it drove the snow.  Thor and I were truly pelted by snow which was sticking to the ground at that point. The trail became difficult to follow as the blazes were hidden by snow and there were no cairns to follow. Hiking above treeline in the wind driven snow, without goggles,  in sneakers,  with the prospect of losing my way, really put me on the far margin of my comfort zone. I was ready to drop below treeline for some shelter but it did not come. Shortly thereafter the sun began to break through and in a matter of minutes was shining brightly!  It is rare to shift from the low point of the day to the high point so quickly but that is just what happened.  Once I could see,  it was absolutely gorgeous.  The light was brilliant giving luster to the landscape.  It was the best bald view I have had on the trip so far!After a couple more miles, a quick look at two wild ponies, and passing the 500 mile mark (WOW!),  I arrived at the shelter where I chose to spend the night. The next shelter was 6 plus miles away and while I would have liked to continue on,  I am having some tightness in my left quad and I thought it better to lay up.

Yesterday and today I dealt with some noticeable quadricep pain on the left side.  It was worse today and did slow me down despite covering 20 miles. I am somewhat worried about it because I don't know how it can heal if I keep walking. In addition,  the weather has been very cold.  While the lower temperature is manageable,  the wind has been relentless! It was very cold overnight in the shelter last night to the point where I put on my down jacket in my bag during the middle of the night. An early morning walk through the remaining miles of the Grayson Highlands would have been very pleasant were it not for a consistent breeze at 20mph plus. I would like to go back there in warmer weather. Ann always tells me how much she hates the wind.  I think I am coming around to that. It seems like  the wind had been consistent since I left Springer Mtn.Tomorrow's forecast calls for higher winds, even colder temps, and snow so after three days of this,  several of us are going into Marion, VA to stay inside and resupply.  There are options to get off at both 10 and 20 miles.  I will see how I feel before I choose where to get off and hope I can do the 20 but would probably be prudent to stick to 10.Met a guy named Osgood in the shelter tonight who thru hiked in 1997.  There is a nice little fireplace in this shelter.  Many thanks to him for building a fire.  The warmth was appreciated by all! Thanks also to trail angel John who met us at a road crossing again today with more hot coffee,  cheeseburgers,  and more sugary treats. Another fine pick me up.  I am grateful to him as well.

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527197,"Once again the morning dawned well below freezing and windy. I had already decided to come into town tonight. The only question was whether I would hike 10 or 20 miles before I did.  I did the cold packing up routine and headed off in a dusting of new snow.  The trail climbed a long ridge with many small summits. The wind up there was relentless and drifted the small amount of snow into some pockets that were almost a foot deep. While my quad pain seemed somewhat better,  the foot pain from my shoe laces led me to call the day at 10 miles and head into town in hopes of solving that. The outfitter in Marion,  VA, listed in the AWOL guide, was worthless. He had a very sparse inventory and shoes of any variety were not part of it. DO NOT depend on that store if you need any real gear. With the shoe issue unresolved,  I walked across town, had lunch at McDonalds, and got a room for the night. As always the shower was welcome as was a meal out which i had at a very reasonably priced Mexican restaurant. They even had a frozen Margarita special for $1.25 each.  Pretty good for a Saturday night.  Got caught up on phone calls,  got more trail food, posted to this and now off to sleep and back to work tomorrow.

I wound up leaving Chestnut Knob after nine since it was raining and the four sided shelter was nice and dry. Met a section hiker named Pacman a few miles in who was camping in a gap and had a fire going.  That was a nice break on a misty foggy morning.  Pushed thru to the Jenkins shelter for lunch at about 1:30. By this time the weather had cleared and it was sunny. The next 4.4 miles were easy despite one climb and I arrived at another possible camp at 3:30. Again too early to stop. I decided to pack water for the night as the ridges today were very dry. Passing up a campsite a mile and a half later proved to be a mistake. I should have stopped there since I have had some leg pain as mentioned earlier. Thinking I would easily find more places,  I suddenly found myself on the ""Appalachian Contour Trail"" which I have joked about many times. While the grade was mostly flat on the trail,  the land was steep for the next four miles so I couldn't find a flat spot to pitch a tent that wasn't right on the trail! Finally I found an old logging road that provided me a little flat real estate so I could pitch. Total miles came in over 20. While I'm glad to have done them, I hope I don't pay in pain tomorrow. So why did I push on? I am totally motivated by the prospect of having breakfast in the town of Bland in the morning. It should be an easy three mile hitch in after a now easy 2 mile hike out. A good breakfast and a little resupply shoud easily allow me to reach Pearisburg by Friday sometime. Food is a great motivator and I guess, in this case, easily outweighed prudence!I am getting better at waiting to see what develops before making plans.

My goal was to rest my body,  drink beer and eat as much as I could to get ahead on calories a bit.  Well all went well on day 1. Most unfortunately,  I wound up with a stomach bug on day 2 and 3 which put a real damper on all fun. It also set me back on my whole nutrition plan. So my plan to get back to the trail rested and refreshed went awry. In addition, spending so much time lying down left me with a tight lower back which definitely affected my hiking comfort.  I must say it was awfully tempting to just get in the car and ride back home this morning. I felt physically drained,  mad that I couldn't  show Ann a better time after all her effort in coming down here, and discouraged in general.  So with a heavy heart I got back on the trail and did what I seem to do best in life. Walk.  The back thing definitely slowed me down a bit and my appetite is still weak so the day dragged on.  By 430 I had only covered 12 plus miles and in my best decision of the day I decided to lay up at this shelter.

I arrived at the parking lot a little before lunch.  What pandemonium! It made me so happy that I didn't have to deal with a car. I had an early lunch and headed up amongst hoards of Saturday day hikers. Day hikers always smell so nice. I guess the bad part about that is if I can smell them,  they can smell me which probably isn't so nice! I ran across Grandma, a nice young man from, most recently, Massachusetts as I was bushwacking back to the AT after a brief mistake. He was at the Hostel as well last night. We wound up hiking together for the rest of the day. We saw more people on trail today than I think I saw in the entire last month combined. And this did not count all the day hikers. There were multiple boy scout groups as well as section hikers.  We arrived at a shelter around 430pm to numerous tents and young boys.  As the volume was high,  Grandma and I opted to pack water and go further down the ridge and find a campsite.  After an hour and a couple more miles we pitched at a small non descript camp where we ate and turned in. He is a great guy and I really enjoyed hiking with him. Tomorrow I am hoping to get into town in time to have breakfast. Then I plan on doing my resupply and hitting the BBQ for lunch.  This place has come highly recommended from friends that live as far away as Pakistan. Can't wait! Today I called Ann for her birthday from Tinker Cliffs.  As I was sitting there talking and the boy scout people were walking around me,  it occurred to me that the outdoors has truly become home.  It was like they were walking through my living room while I was on the phone. I really don't have anywhere else to go whereas they all did. Strange! Whatever,  if all goes well I should be to the Shenandoah in about 8 days.  I hope everything is worked out in terms of the forest fire when I arrive. On to Daleville in the morning!","Four Pines Hostel

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529695,"Today marks the first time I hiked into town,  resupplied, and left the same day. It was a fun day but definitely hard to leave in the afternoon especially when many friends were staying overnight. After being off early last week though it just made sense. Grandma,  One Feather,  and I hiked the 6.5 miles into town in time for breakfast at a real nice diner called Angelle's. They had a deck and we had a great meal outside with some nice local music and also WiFi. Including time spent calling my family, I was there easily two hours. Afterwards, One Feather let me shower and base out of his hotel room for the day which was really key! I was able to wash a couple things too which dried in the sun while I did my errands.  The most necessary things, grocery,  meals,  and the outdoor store, were all in a plaza within a quarter mile of both the hotel and the trail. Perfect! After shopping, I went to  the seemingly world renowned Three Little Pigs BBQ which featured East Carolina vinegar based bbq which I enjoyed with a nice local Virginia pale ale. They even give thru hikers free dessert! (Note to Bill Powell, be sure to stop here on your next trip north.  It is a quarter mile off I-81.) As I was leaving, a few other hikers came along to eat their meals.After reorganizing my stuff, I headed out of town for a five mile hike to the first shelter where I arrived around 6pm.  Grandma, who said he was going to hike out as well, looked pretty comfortable with his friends when I left so I was very surprised when he showed up at the shelter just before dark. Points for him. I am very glad to be beyond Daleville.  That stretch from where Ann dropped me off seemed like a sort of purgatory to get through before truly being back on trail. I crossed back to the east of I-81today and now begin a pretty steady northeasterly line of travel. I have meandered around southwestern Virginia for almost 270 miles.  I am glad to now be on a beeline for more northerly climes as mentioned.  Many thanks again to One Feather for his hospitality today!","Campsite at mIle 721

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529903,"What a fabulous day.  I could tell you about the big black snake I saw on the trail today,  I could tell you about crossing the Blue Ridge Parkway for the first time,  I could tell you that it was my second longest day at over 23 miles,  or that I found my first deer antler in 750 miles of hiking. But I think I will tell you about my faith in humanity and the good in people. It was hot today and rather than quit at 4:00pm at a dry buggy shelter, we pushed on to Jennings Creek so we could swim after a long day which was likely the hottest of the hike so far. The water was beautiful and felt so good after the walking! Grandma and I had seen in the book that there was a campground with a store 1.2 miles away so we decided, perhaps foolishly,  to leave our packs by the river and see if we could get a ride there. One woman did stop and I asked her if she would be willing to give us a ride. I could tell she really wanted to but was uncomfortable enough that she told us no and drove on. I understood why she must have felt trepidation at picking two men up on a country road with all that can happen these days. Shortly afterwards,  another woman and her daughter stopped and when we gave our story gladly let us in their car and brought us to the store.  What we didn't know was that the store was near the end of a dead end road. The mom, who's name I did not get, offered to wait while we got cooked food then bring us back to where we had left our stuff. How kind they were! The daughter's name was Mary Catherine, a senior in high school, who will attend college in the fall for environmental policy, the same major that Grandma pursued at Dartmouth. In addition,  she aspires to hike the AT when she graduates college.  There was clearly much to talk about! We were so grateful to this mom and daughter who took time out of their day to help us fulfill a whim. Some say that the trail provides.  I would say that good people provide for those on the trail.  Those of us in need really, or sometimes just in want. It is a shame that some people fear strangers and a bigger shame that others have done terrible things to instill this fear. A risk taken by both sides this afternoon led to a meeting with both immediate benefit for us,  and hopefully future inspiration for a young woman with big hopes and dreams! After a beautiful day and a better human experience,  I am camped peacefully by a trout stream where I watched fish jump and bats fly with a quality hiking partner this evening.

The water sounded great and it was easy to sleep.  Things were pretty damp this morning however but not to fear,  another hot day was in store. As we climbed out of the valley,  you could feel the heat mount. Today was another hot dry day which featured multiple climbs totaling close to 5000 feet. With no swimming hole at the end and rain forecasted,  my mood was not the best. I felt somewhat discouraged throughout the day even though my body felt good and even my feet didn't hurt to speak of.  While I do not think of quitting, today it was easy to think of a number of  things I could,  and might rather,  be doing instead of wandering through non descript hardwood forests for the fifty third day in a row.Spring has sprung down low and it still looks like winter up high.  It makes for interesting views from the ridges. The green leaves are still slowly creeping up.  Perhaps some rain will finish the job.  The highlight of the day was the number of wildflowers that are blooming.  I saw carpets of pink trillium, these cool little white bleeding hearts,  and countless other colorful flowers.  Those and maybe the avionics globe on the summit of Apple  Orchard Mtn were the most interesting things I saw today. Grandma and I continue to hike together. He is a good guy.  We will likely go into Buena Vista to stay over and resupply tomorrow especially if the weather is bad.

He had been on a cross country trip for three months and will be moving into a place in nearby Lexington this weekend.  He is quite a civil war and local history buff.  He has joined us for dinner along with a section hiker named Dan. Another unlikely combination of people that have shared some good times. Tonight we went to an Applebee's and I was able to have a steak dinner for the first time since I left home.  It was really good.

This afternoon, after hiking thru much sunshine,  we rounded a peak, the fog was waiting, and with it, much cooler temperatures.  If we were on one side of the mountain it was a warm dry fog,  the other,  it was a cold wet fog. Guess which one we got when we arrived at the shelter. I'm afraid my sleeping bag will be very damp in the morning. I was pleased to make the miles today as tomorrow they are calling for heavy rain overnight.  Being here tonight gives us an option on a shorter day tomorrow so we could shelter up and try to stay dry.  A longer day on Sunday could get me to Waynesboro and indoors if need be that night.  As always,  we'll see what the days bring.

Probably not the worst idea as we did two twenty plus mile days previously. We arrived fairly early and have spent the afternoon sitting in the shelter doing mostly nothing. I ate one dinner as a late lunch and will have another shortly. The hike today involved a three thousand foot loss of elevation followed by an immediate three thousand foot gain on the other side of the valley. Lots of slippery rocks. Grandma took a tumble but fortunately was able to get up!  There are lots of weekend hikers around. In fact I am impressed by how many people are out here in spite of the lousy weather forecast. Tomorrow calls for showers and thundershowers.It is very easy to question why I am out here when I am cold, damp, and most of my stuff is damp. So far nothing is totally wet. I have a harder time enjoying anything in these conditions. I think mostly about how to get out of these conditions. This then leads me to feel like a wimpy thru hiker. What I have learned is that many of us feel the same so I guess I am not alone. It still doesn't make me feel much better though. On the other hand, I won't be totally wet tonight, I'll only be damp.

Mission accomplished for sure.  Waynesboro is the biggest town I've been in since I left Atlanta.  A few locals laughed when I told them that today but it is true. I'm on the new end of town which is your typical miracle mile of America kind of place.  I shopped at Walmart today which I always hate doing.  However,  it was noticeably cheaper than many other grocery stores I've been to on the hike.

I seem to finally have found the easier part of Virginia.  The hiking today was graded, not too rocky, and easy to negotiate. I completed my miles by about 330pm. There was a good thundershower this afternoon that pretty well soaked me.  While I don't usually like to quit so early,  more rain is forecasted so I opted to get a guaranteed shelter spot.

It was quiet and beautiful in the woods with broken skies and splashes of sunlight.  The walking was easy and I was by myself most of the day. The first sighting was a beautiful barred owl that swooped over my head and perched on a nearby branch.  I did some barred owl hoots and he swiveled his head all the way around to look at me.  He stayed there a couple minutes then flew off. A while later, I looked to my right to see another black bear standing there looking at me.  Usually they take right off when they see people.  This one just looked at me.  We were twenty yards apart! I moved up the trail just a bit and we continued to look at each other. After at least a full minute, he just turned around and walked away. This was a very cool encounter.  I have never been close to a bear when it didn't just run when it first either saw or smelled me. Later on the day,  I jumped a deer who was in the trail.  I have also seen some cool birds in the south. I mentioned that there are lots of pileated woodpeckers down here in an earlier entry.  I love seeing those.  Recently I have also seen indigo buntings, some cool warblers,  and a scarlet Tanager. These birds are rare at home.  They have awesome colors. I love seeing cool colors like that in nature. I am suddenly having some pain in my right leg near my shin. I have felt it a couple times before but today was the first time it recurred for a second day. It is a definite distraction and painful.  I spoke with my personal athletic trainer who told me that it is likely an overuse issue but that I shouldn't worry too much about it.  I am hoping to get through the park in five days to get to my cousins by Saturday.  I hope that I can sustain the necessary pace. This will involve a 23 plus mile day tomorrow.  This would be no problem if I felt good. I guess time will tell. Even though I crossed the 900 mile mark today,  I always feel like the spectre of a potential hike ending injury is not far away. The other highlight of my day was stopping at a national park wayside.  That's basically a restaurant and gift shop. Needless to say I skipped the gift shop and headed right to the grill where breakfast was still being served. I had a breakfast sandwich,  a stack of pancakes,  and a very nice coffee. Unfortunately national parks seem to have stadium pricing.  I have spent the last two nights with Pants the Pirate and her boyfriend Zen Master. They are a very nice young couple who are VCU grads. Pants did a great job starting a fire with wet everything tonight only to have a shower come through and spoil the fun. Time for sleep with hopes that I will feel better in the morning.

Tonight I am in the shelter with several people I've hiked and camped with before including Bigfoot, Grandma, Lookout, Uncle Frito, and a few new hikers I met today. In some ways this hike is like a big mobile sleepover. The faces may change daily but everyone is always around. Bigfoot off handedly said that hiking the AT is like high school. In some ways it really is. There is even a hiker yearbook that someone publishes annually. Some jokes were made about having a prom!This afternoon I ran into Slug on the trail. He was leaning over taking pictures of something. I knew it was him by his rain jacket and the fact that he was taking pictures in the rain. When I got to him, he was taking pictures of a Copperhead! It was about 18 to 20 inches long with a triangle shaped head and the back of its head was copper colored. It was not bright colored and blended in to the wet trail very well. Had Slug not been looking at it I could have easily not seen it or maybe even stepped on it. I did not expect to see any snakes in the rain. He is going to share a picture with me which I will post when I get it. While I really hate snakes I admit it was very cool to see a venomous snake outdoors and up close. I had never really seen one before.My shin was somewhat uncomfortable to start today so I expected it would be painful by afternoon. I was very pleased that for whatever reason, Aleve or it is getting better, it felt OK by the end of my hike today. I hope this carries through tomorrow and beyond. There was a short moment when it felt like my left shin might have a similar feeling but that did not settle in.Tomorrow I should cross the 1000 mile mark by lunch time. That will be a good milestone as will leaving Virginia which I should be able to do on Monday. Let's hope all goes well and I can arrive in Harpers Ferry by Monday afternoon!Many thanks again to Mike and Laurie for bailing me out and putting me up, and putting up with me while I rested my leg. They are wonderful people and I am lucky to count them as family. They are pictured here tonight.","VA 522, Front Royal, VA

I passed that milestone with Grandma and Uncle Frito around lunchtime. Pictures were taken,  food was eaten,  and social media was updated promptly. Fortunately for me AT&T is beginning to be more consistent on the trail so I was able to play too!The weather was perhaps better today than any other in the past two plus weeks. Dry air,  a cool breeze, and temps around 60 though it never felt that warm. I am tented up tonight with  my forty degree bag with temps heading for the 30s. If in not mistaken,  it's May 15 and I'm in Virginia. Shouldn't it be a bit warmer? No complaints though.The place we're staying tonight gave us a real nice pasta dinner and a dessert in exchange for a donation.  It was very nice.  I shared that meal with the same group I camped with last night. Tomorrow I should arrive at the ceremonial halfway point of the trail. Which is also exciting. My shin was sore this afternoon and I hope I did not overdo things. Tomorrow will be a shorter day.

I was sooo ready to be done there. Second, I arrived at the ceremonial halfway point of the trail this afternoon! Harpers Ferry, WV was long the true midpoint. As the trail has gotten longer, it has remained the unofficial midpoint. I was the 193rd northbounder to arrive this year.  I feel real good about that especially in light of my recent challenges.Harpers Ferry is a beautiful town that I was lucky enough to see on a beautiful day. I really should have spent more time there. There would be lots of history that I didn't learn in high school that I could have learned today! I did however get a burger, a beer,  and a milk shake before I left.Lastly, I walked the C&O tow path which I have always read about but never seen.  It was a beautiful walk along the Potomac river.

I was quite proud of myself early on. It was raining when I woke up and rained pretty much all morning. I generally hate rain but, after a meager motel breakfast, I packed up and hit the trail around 930am. I walked out in the rain and found my way back along rte 340, down through the alley, across the railroad tracks, and back to the C&O tow path where I picked up the trail. It was a cold rain so I kept my rain jacket on which I prefer not to do. It just gets wet. I know that sounds strange but I do work hard to keep my raincoat dry.The trail was muddy,  slick,  but very well maintained.  I can only think of one blowdown I encountered all day.  The Maryland trail volunteers appear to do a great job. Lunchtime found me at the Gathburg state park where I stopped for a quick lunch and a quick look at some civil war Era ruins. After that it was an easy five miles to the shelter.  This is a beautiful shelter and probably the nicest shelter structure I've seen on the trail.  The floors are urethaned, it is log cabin construction, there is a loft, it is clean and no graffiti.  Their is a big porch that covers the picnic table. There is a great group of people here tonight as well including most of the people I've been with since last Saturday. And, the rain quit and gave way to some blue sky by dinner time!I had a good talk with myself while hiking this morning about the second half of the trail.  I have options,  a short term plan, and a longer term plan. I'll be staying with Molly tomorrow night and I will visit with LG'S friend Tucker as I cross into PA. He has offered to put me up for a couple nights and set me up to slack pack a day. This will give me several days of more moderate miles which I hope will help me get back to full strength. I am optimistic about the next stretch which will bring me to New England.

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533817,"A very short day today which ended by crossing interstate 70 on a footbridge.  I don't know why but I like crossing interstates.  They serve as sort of a milestone for me in terms of northward progress. I've now crossed the following major highways,  I-40, I-26, I-77, I-81 (twice), I-66, and now, I-70. I'm really like a kid when I cross them. I like to watch the trucks and I pull my arm down until the big rigs pull on their air horns. Stupid but fun for me.Molly's friend Steve was waiting for me when I got to the other side and I was quickly transported from trail land to school land. Within an hour I was sitting in a sophomore history class.  What a change! Being a private school,  and arriving just before noon,  lunch was next on the agenda which featured a family style chicken tender meal with salad,  chocolate milk,  and dessert.  I met lots of students as well. Perfect timing. I will stay here tonight and get back on the trail tomorrow mid morning.  It occurred to me today that groomed is a word that could be used to describe the trail in Maryland.  Everything seems orderly, neat, and tidy.  The trail is easy with several state parks along the way.  They are all very well manicured. It is a very pleasant place to hike regardless of the weather.  It can feel like you are hiking in someone's backyard and at times,  you are. The other new thing is a lot of signs that tell you what is prohibited. These are the first I've seen outside of the two national parks.  A sure sign that we are much closer to civilization. I thought it important to put in a plug for Maryland as I'm sure it is easy for most thru hikers to forget.Last thought, today's picture is the copperhead I saw with Slug.

For parts of the day I felt like I hit my true stride for the first time in two weeks. I crossed paths with Garmin and Tortoise this morning, two lashers whom I hadn't seen since before McAfee Knob. At the Pen Mar park,  I ran across Steady and Teach,  the Noodles,  and I finally met Spirit of 76. They had ordered pizza and invited me to join them so we had a really nice picnic on a pleasant sunny day. We lingered for easily an hour. It would have been easy to stay longer.Within a third of a mile I left the south for good by crossing the Mason Dixon line into Pennsylvania! Seven miles later I met Tucker on schedule and returned to his home for a wonderful chicken dinner. Judy and Tucker  have been very kind hosts. Tomorrow I'll head into Pennsylvania on what looks like it will be a very rainy  day. It has been great to have family and friend visits over the last couple weeks. That won't happen again for awhile which means it is time to log some miles. I will approach this next stint with caution. While I would like to do 20 mile days, I would rather not have to take zeros to offset doing too much.  Mind over mind as Grandma says. Let's see how that really works.","MD Rte 77

I ran across AK whom I hadn't seen in awhile.  I also met a couple new flip flop thru hikers who started north less than a week ago.  It is very interesting to talk with them and listen to them.  Everything is so new to them and they are uncertain about so many things. I am the only northbound thru hiker here tonight so that makes me the resident expert by default. This is an interesting role and it makes me realize how much I have learned and how automatic things have become for me since I began in Georgia. It also helps me understand that I have truly built up some resilience.   It is a confidence boost for sure. I'm always up for those! In fact, I really need them.About seven o'clock I learned that the fun group I left on Tuesday morning had taken a zero day today at the shelter just seven miles north of here. Had I known that at three o'clock when I arrived, I probably would have pushed on to rejoin them.  It's probably best that I didn't find out until too late.Tonight I am glad to be here and back on the trail. While staying in town is nice, it does disconnect you from the trail lifestyle. I don't anticipate any more bumps or opportunities that would take me off until possibly New Jersey where I have two old AMC friends who suggested they may want to connect when I go through.

This allowed me to make 17 plus miles, see the AT museum which was very cool,  dry out,  eat some real food, and see how I felt doing longer miles. The good news is I felt good all day.

He has become the trail ambassador for sure. He moved on a few miles tonight. There are five other thru hikers here tonight so it should be a quiet night.

This morning I figured out why they call the AT the long green tunnel. Spring has sprung both in the canopy and the understory so it really is kind of like walking in a tunnel. Of course the sunny weather couldn't last.  By early afternoon it clouded over and I ultimately found myself in my first true thundershower of the whole trip. While I anticipated cold hard rain, I didn't bother with my raincoat as the temp was in the 70s. However, my expectations that the sun would return quickly were not met so I arrived at the ATC office in Boiling Springs very cold and wet. Fortunately they have a really nice porch and they let me change into dry clothes inside. Slug was there so we visited awhile. Back in East Tennessee, I met two friends who were section hiking.  Jeff and Tim camped with us at Iron Mtn and Watauga Lake. Jeff had invited me to contact him when I arrived in his neighborhood in PA which I did this morning. Long and short, he met me in Boiling Springs this afternoon and brought me to his home about half an hour away. I got to meet his family and share an AYCE Chinese buffet dinner with them which was very pleasant! We had a chance to share some trail stories and some pictures before retiring for the night.  Jeff will bring me back to the trail tomorrow and I will then cross the Cumberland Valley towards Duncannon. While roadside trail magic has all but disappeared, the generosity of people like Jeff and Patti, his wife, has been awesome. Thanks again Jeff!

Stretch, a young German hiker, left well before 7am and I never saw him again.  He was getting off to take a zero somewhere. King Arthur also left before me planning on a 27 or more mile day.  Now he is a fast hiker.  I had crossed paths with him back in Virginia. I got going after he left.  About two hours into the day, I caught up to him sitting on a log taking a short break.  Arthur said to me when he saw me ""Wow, not bad for an old guy, nobody catches or passes me."" Now let me tell you this made my morning! While it is not my goal to keep pace with 20 year olds anymore, I did have high hopes at the beginning, I was certainly pleased to have him recognize me for it.

He had some free time and was excited to come visit a day or two. Boy was I excited to see him! The last nine miles weren't too difficult and I arrived at the road crossing around 430pm to Sawyer and a cooler of sodas left by a local family. It was the first roadside trail magic I could remember since before Daleville, VA almost 500 miles to the south. Saw told me that while he was waiting he met Uncle Frito, Merlin, and Monkey the dog. I was glad he got to meet some hikers that knew me. We jumped in the truck, drove to Hamburg and settled in a room overnight but not before seeing and picking up Dutch and Clean Skittle on a busy road.

That's the first time I could help one of my own out in a regular life kind of way. Oh the joys of having a vehicle!Today was also a good wildlife day. I jumped two deer, three turkeys, a garter snake, and was surprised by a really long rat snake in the trail later in the day.

After my alternate adventure yesterday, I wanted to have a good day mile wise.  The day went smoothly overall.  The weather was beautiful,  dry air,  bright blue sky,  although it was still hot.  Temps were forecasted in the 80s and they may have made it there. I saw very few people on the trail today. I passed Six Legs in the morning.  He is taking it easy due to his recent spider bite and infection.  I also caught up to Gingersnap and played leap frog with her until we arrived at camp this evening. I enjoy hiking and camping with her. I met a hiker named Hops who started in late March.  He is camped with us tonight and is  making fast progress. New Jersey hiking has been fairly easy although we haven't completely  passed the Pennsylvania type rocks. They are however,  not as bad here. I am seeing signs of the north country now both on trail and in town. The number of Beech trees that I see is rising as is the number of sugar maples. I'm seeing far less May apples as well.  Last night in a pub I had a choice of a Long Trail brew or a Magic Hat brew. Both are made in Vermont.  I also found Green Mountain coffee at a quick stop on Saturday. Biscuits and gravy for breakfast is no longer an option on the menu. Big bummer! I believe I miss the south.  I can't remember if I mentioned this in a previous post but the south is the land of yes and the north is the land of no. I see more and more signs that say no this and no that. And speaking of no, I have started to see alot of yellow Posted signs.

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537207,"Today's hike featured food,  swamps,  woods,  a very solid climb,  and the best wildlife experience of the hike to date. Food included breakfast at a country store in Unionville,  NY. The trail was in NJ and the store was 0.4 miles away. Go figure. We also stopped  at a farm stand store in the afternoon. While I could have had ice cream,  I opted for an apple, a banana,  and a chocolate milk.  Before arriving there,  we crossed the famous New Jersey boardwalk.  Not the one in Atlantic City, the one on the AT. Lots of swamp land today.  I saw some turtles and a blue heron in that section. The highlight of the day came as Gingersnap and I were starting the 900 foot climb called the Stairway to Heaven.  As we were beginning the climb,  I looked to my right and caught motion in the woods.  A closer look revealed the largest black bear I have ever seen. An even closer look revealed that this mother had four cubs trailing her! I have never seen five bears together. It was truly magnificent to see them. It didn't take long to figure out that the bears were taking a path that had them crossing the trail directly in front of us. We stopped and waited to see what they would do. Sure enough they crossed the trail about 30 yards in front of us. We held where we were and waited awhile. One of the Cubs lied down as if to take a nap. At one point I inadvertently clicked my poles together which alerted two of the Cubs.  This in turn alerted the sow who turned and looked right at us. While we backtracked some, she didn't seem concerned with us in the least which surprised me. A few minutes later,  they crossed the trail and were above it.  Some people were coming from the opposite direction so we took the opportunity to quickly move by the bears. Fortunately the trail went a long way before switching back and by the time it did we were well above the bear family. This was such a cool experience! The cubs were cute kind of walking and rolling along. One tried to climb a tree. The mother was truly huge. Gingersnap estimated she weighed more than 600 pounds. While I'm not sure, it really was the largest bear I've ever seen. So what's cooler?  Seeing a rattlesnake or seeing five bears all at once?! All in all, despite a bit of rain this afternoon and again this evening, and having to go to bed sticky, this has been a remarkable day!","Jim Murray Property

We were standing under the tiny roof of the hot dog stand when the truck showed up to deliver a case of mustard. Since it was raining so hard,  I asked Mike if he might be willing to give us a ride to the creamery. While he noted that the cab would not fit two of us, he did not hesitate to offer us the opportunity to ride in the refrigerated rear of the truck where the orders were. Now I don't know about you but before today I had never ridden in a refrigerator truck. Least of all when I was wet. Unfortunately and fortunately the ride was pretty short. Just enough time to see all the fine meat and cheese products they had.  There were some very nice desserts as well. Not quite enough time to truly consider stuffing a ten pound ham in my pack which in hindsight would have been very tempting! Tomorrow well work to make up some of today's missed miles.

I think the temperature topped out in the 60s. Perfect!  I felt like I could hike forever. The trail made a significant change today.  For the first time in hundreds of miles we began to cross ridges instead of following them. This made for lots of ups and downs. New York also has alot of granite slabs on their small mountain tops. All of the sudden with the change in vegetation and terrain,  this all smacks of New England hiking!  It's almost like they're tuning us back up for the challenges to come.  Grandma, who is camped with me tonight for the first time in awhile says that the mid Atlantic states have turned us back into yogurt. Others here tonight include Six Legs, Gingersnap, Tesla and Grits, and a couple section hikers.  Wildlife sightings today included a hen turkey and about a dozen chicks who I jumped coming up a hill.  They all flew off in a panic. It was something to see! Crossing I-87 was also a highlight for me today. I have seen the AT bridge across that road many times. Today I finally got to walk across it. For me that's a noteworthy milestone!Its amazing to me how the daily conditions affect my mind.  One day I'm thinking,  bag this,  the next I'm all in. I have two options with my hike.  Preserve the thru hike or complete the Appalachian Trail. One involves completing the whole trail in a calendar year.  The other completing the trail in your lifetime. Prior to this adventure,  I had already done 440 miles of the AT in New England. When I reach Salisbury,  CT,  I will have done the trail in its entirety from Springer Mtn, GA to Grafton Notch, ME. My choice then becomes preserve the thru hike,  or complete the trail. Two different takes on much the same thing. Today I choose the thru hike. In about a week I will have to fully commit. May the weather be fabulous on that day!","NY Rte 17A

Took a side trail to a state park concession for a cheeseburger mid day. There was a beautiful beach and nobody was there. Three kids were staffing the concession and we're very bored. I ate my burger while chatting with them. I got to the RPH shelter where there was still a bunk so I took it.

There is a large group of hikers all together all of the sudden. This makes for increased pressure on resources such as camping, and resupply food at these little stores. I miss regular grocery stores but the towns the trail goes near don't have them and people in this part of the country don't seem to want to pick up hitch hikers. This makes things more challenging. Also, there is less camping to be found away from shelters. I think things will return to the way they were down south once we reach Vermont and points beyond.It remains a daily challenge to stay motivated and find fun in hiking day after day. There are good moments for sure. I feel like every day I wait for something different or unusual to happen. It is nice to have a little something to look forward to.  Tomorrow there is a store about five miles up so I can have coffee in the morning.

They sound like they will run right through my tent. A couple weeks ago, I camped by another road in Pennsylvania. Once before I camped by a road in Virginia. That one wasn't very busy at all. There was also a very nice river for swimming and nice background noise. Regular readers may remember that entry. The point is that the Appalachian Trail isn't a complete wilderness experience. In fact, lately, it is more like a trail in the woods that connects a series of stores where you can get coffee and egg sandwiches, or Gatorade and pizza, cookies, or my current favorite, snack size pies! Actually I'll always go for the coffee and egg sandwich given a choice but the little pies travel well in the top of the pack for dessert! I had heard New York was known as the deli state. Now I know why. While the opportunity to get pizza delivered to a shelter does wonders for morale and attempting to mitigate the significant amount of weight I think I've lost, it does nothing to help reduce the weight of my pack because I am carrying the same three days worth of food I bought a week ago! It also doesnt do alot in terms of plussing my bank account.  All this being said, I'll take it and enjoy it. The mid Atlantic states will yield to New England sometime before lunch tomorrow and by the time I get to Vermont those trail side food meccas will be a distant but pleasant memory.

The hiking is changing yet again.  The long low ridges that were Virginia lasted through New Jersey.  The amount of rocks increased through Pennsylvania and slowly eased off in New York where the trail began crossing ridges instead of following them.  The easier grades there are sharpening in Connecticut with shorter but steeper ascents and descents. The views feature a rolling hilly landscape now with the farmlands a thing of the past.  More signs of being in New England with paper birch, White pine, and hemlock trees. It is nice to be back! However I realize that at least in terms of the natural environment,  there will be nothing new for me to see. I am effectively home. It is an early sign that this trip actually has an end.

I had pitched my tent on a platform and that did not go well.  Water found its way under and through my tent due to the fact that I could not truly get the fly taut. It was wet enough that I took my stuff and moved to the shelter between showers so my sleeping bag would stay dry. My tent was pretty well soaked when I took it down this morning.  Looking for some sort of diversion today,  I decided to hitch into Wallingford for coffee after I had hiked about 7 miles. I got a ride in quickly and enjoyed a roadside coffee at a small deli/store. The bright sun and warm pavement allowed me to dry my tent fairly quickly.  While getting back to the trail wasnt as easy,  I finally got picked up by a young couple in a Subaru,  of course, who are participating in the Rainbow Gathering that is happening on the Green Mountain National Forest this summer.  They were peaceful and friendly and their car reeked of weed.

He was a northbounder who finished in May in 85 days. Wow. He is now heading south with Chica. They had pitched their tents in the yard which is beautiful. It was well after 6pm, I was hot and tired, so I gladly did the same. It was an interesting group, the four of us all being from different countries. This was a first for me on the trail and quite fun. I took an opportunity to speak French with Thomas. I think I surprised him. This spot is much like the Murray Property in New Jersey though smaller. I am grateful to be here tonight although it means a slightly longer day tomorrow. I can tell I am in New Hampshire as there wasn't a switchback to be seen on any of the climbs today. Tomorrow will feature three climbs, 2400 feet, 1500 feet, and 900 feet. Of course there are the associated descents as well. With a goal of 21 plus miles, I will be busy. NH will be challenging but it is great to be back where I spent my late adolescence!","Hanover, NH

This makes 12 overall.  I spotted this one's butt. It was an odd looking black shape in the early morning woods.  Sighting confirmed when I saw that shape move! It had no  idea that I was there. It was peacefully feeding along. I watched it until it moved out of sight then I hiked on. I feel as if I have been very lucky seeing wildlife.  As a hunter you learn that you can't expect to see any game if you're constantly looking at your feet. Now that Pennsylvania is behind me,  I've been freed up to look beyond the two feet of trail in front of me. Far more relaxing!Tonight I am the guest of Santa and Wonder in their New Hampshire home. He picked me up this afternoon at Rte 25C. Tomorrow Santa and I are going to slack pack over Mt. Moosilauke southbound. This was an idea he had long ago. I'm pleased to be able to participate. I will need to hike an additional 5 miles in order to be fully caught up with him at Kinsman Notch. The next day we will slack pack to Franconia Notch where Wonder and Ann will meet us for a night in town. We are currently planning to hike together thru the Whites and beyond. Wonder and her daughters cooked a wonderful meal which I was able to share with Santa's brother and both families. The Spaniard was also here for dinner. He is staying at the nearby Glencliff hostel.It was another hot day today. Despite the heat, I successfully covered the mileage I had planned. A 6:00am start allowed me cooler temps for the hardest part of the day, the climb up Smarts Mtn followed by Mt Cube.  The last five miles were easier which was good because I was tired. I must have drank at least a gallon and a half of water today. A quick thanks to the trail angel who left snacks in suspended buckets just north if Rte 25A.

Wonder dropped us off in Kinsman Notch and we slack packed over Mt. Moosilauke southbound. It is the first time in years that I had hiked up there.  As always the view was stellar! The weather was very nice with a modest breeze that kept us cool and dry. We spent some time on the summit before heading down the carriage road and on to Glencliff. Wonder and her daughters met us there where they all went swimming and I continued on another five miles to Rte 25C to complete the section. Santa met me there and we returned to his place then worked on resupply. A very nice meal on the deck followed which included a birthday celebration for Wonder. Happy Birthday!I am very grateful to Santa, Wonder, and their daughters for putting me up and taking such good care of me. Tomorrow we will slack pack the next 16 miles over the Kinsman range and into Franconia Notch where Ann will pick us up, Wonder will meet us, and we will spend the night in Lincoln. It is always fun to be in the White Mtns.  I have fond memories of trips here with my Dad. Occasionally my mother would come but the Whites were mostly our place. He would take me and my brother day hiking.  Sometimes we would stay over and do more than one hike. Dad helped me with a few false starts on sections of the AT where things didn't go according to plan and he would bail me out. I do wish he were around to know that I have lasted this far on the trail and that it is becoming increasingly likely that I will complete the whole thing. I know he would like to live vicariously through me for this adventure and that he would be proud of me for finally doing it!","NH Rte 25C

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540318,"Welcome back to the White Mountains.  Today's hike featured the most difficult climb on the entire AT so far in my opinion. That would be the climb from Eliza Brook to the summit of South Kinsman. While the Beaver Brook trail up Moosilauke is one of the five steepest miles,  this climb was sustained for well over 2000 vertical feet and involved much stepping on large rocks. It is not atypical of many White Mountain climbs.  It was a real example of the kind of hiking we have in store in the coming week or so. The section of the trail from Kinsman to Lonesome Lake hut, while not as steep,  was also very rocky. These are not like Pennsylvania rocks,  these are very large,  with ledge,  that lead to many power steps both up and down. Our original estimate of getting into Franconia Notch was about an hour an a half off. When we arrived,  Ann was waiting for us and we headed into town to meet Wonder and celebrate her birthday at a nice restaurant in Lincoln. The weather was far better than forecast today which led to some nice views.

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540343,"Today was perhaps my best/favorite day on the trail overall.  The weather was ideal. Cooler with very dry air and clear skies, after awhile that is. Left the hut around 8am after a nice AMC breakfast.  The trail today led me through my favorite part of the White Mtns. I have always loved the long ridge that connects South Twin to Mt. Guyot and Bondcliff trail. I can't describe how beautiful it was up there this morning. I took a brief side trip off the AT to the summit of Guyot. From that point you are in the heart of the Whites. The view is incredible.  You can see every major ridge in the range. It is one of my favorite spots in the world. Today's hike also led me by some other favorite places that I hadn't been in years including the Zeacliff, Zealand River, Thoreau Falls, and Ethan Pond. There was beauty everywhere. I have a lot of history here and it brought back many memories for me of hikes and skis with old friends and family from my high school and college years to now; hikes I have done and trips that I've led. My one regret of the day is that I could not spend more time at each place. One big theme about the thru hike is you have to keep moving. I could have happily spent several days in the area I passed through today. With the goal of completing the AT by the end of July, it is not easy for me to consider stopping and hanging out for an afternoon. I will probably look back on this and wish I had been able to relax more and take more time. This is the disadvantage of having to be home by a certain date. The good part for me is that these mountains are close to where I live so in the future I could come back most anytime I want. I had been thinking that I might never backpack again after I finish the trail. Today gave me reason to believe that I will!","AMC Galehead Hut

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540587,"My feet hurt. My knees are tired. I am physically beat. This never used to happen to me when I used to hike in the Whites. I dont want to admit to being physically older but I guess I am.  That being said,  I have completed 124 miles of NH in 8 days. The daily mileage has dropped as mentioned previously. Despite all that,  I choose to give myself credit. I am doing well through this section. I am a thru hiker. I am a professional. The top of the pecking order. I have confidence in my ability. I will succeed. But man, do I need a day off! That will come after one more day hike tomorrow. Yesterday I had a chance to hike with Ann and Aliza for awhile. It took a few days of thinking to come  up with a plan that would get Aliza to the summit of Mt Washington while allowing me to continue thru hiking. We spent the morning hiking together to the Lakes of the Clouds Hut where we snacked on some left over pancakes which were really good.  Lynn the bull cook gave us some real maple syrup to go with them which was a treat. We parted ways here with Ann and Aliza heading down through Tuckerman Ravine and me heading south to Crawford Notch on a flip flop slack pack. The views were great although the skies were not as clear blue as the day before. I made reasonable time across the range and finished my hike around 5pm. I ran into Mantis who is currently hiking with his Dad and staying in some of the huts. I also saw Sister, Pony, and Capt. America over the course of the afternoon. All in all a very pleasant day.Today was not so pleasant. Last night's thunder showers resulted in very wet conditions above treeline as well as some very significant wind. I took a shuttle back to the summit to begin the days hike. The temp was in the 40s, the wind was averaging over 60 miles an hour, and it was raining. I was glad to see that Mantis and his Dad had made it to the summit from Lakes despite the conditions. This gave me hope that I could successfully hike. I dressed in full wool base layers, put on my fleece pullover and gloves, and my rain jacket and pants. I had my puffy if I needed it as well as a wool hat. If wind chill was considered, I was heading out into winter conditions. The wind hit hard as I came around the corner of the tip top house. Enough so that it dropped me to the ground. It was going to be tough going. I gathered my wits and began the slow arduous process of walking in the wind. It was very challenging hiking that required constant attention to footing, pole placement, and shifting winds. There was no view at all as the cloud deck extended well below me elevation wise. The only way I could guage progress was with the trail signs I passed.  While progress was slow, I was able to reach the Madison hut, six miles away, in a little more than three hours. When I was in the lee of the peaks, the wind wasn't so bad. At points however, all I could do was get down on all fours and wait for a chance to move again. The worst was just north of Edmands Col. The bull cook at Madison told me I was the first hiker to come through from Mt. Washington that day. It was after one pm.  After a break for lunch inside, I headed back out and over Mt . Madison and down the Osgood ridge. While the wind wasn't as severe I was very relieved to finally drop below treeline where the hiking required far less concentration. I had come eight miles fully exposed in the heaviest winds I think I had ever hiked in. The rest of the afternoon involved traversing across the floor of the Great gulf and down into Pinkham Notch where Pete picked me up. We went back to Jackson in plenty of time to attend the fire department barbecue where I was well fed and also had a chance to see my old friend Mark Hitchcock, an AMC legend of sorts!Since I have been back in NH, I have experienced every type of weather condition possible except for snow (apparently that is a possibility for the highest elevations tonight). I guess that is just par for the course! It is great to be back in the Whites. While the hiking is hard, the mountains are spectacular. I look forward to finishing them tomorrow and heading into the Mahoosucs and ultimately, Maine!","Mt. Washington Summit

She was working on completing her four thousand footers in NH so in two trips, we did the Wildcat range and the Carter-Moriah range. Yesterday's hike for me combined the two and added the leg down the Rattle River into Gorham.  The winds were still around and it was cooler in the morning.  The Carter section is a nice mixed bag of boreal forest with enough above treeline stuff to keep it interesting.  There were many fine views of Mt Washington and the northern presidential range.I met Ann at the road crossing around 500pm and we went to the local walmart for a few day off supplies. While there I ran into a hiker with a backpack in his cart, a sure sign of a thru hiker. Wolverine told me he was traveling with Magic and a couple others and that Magic was in the store! I soon found him and it was a great reunion. We hadn't seen eachother since the Grayson Highlands in VA. He is a quality young man who's company I always enjoyed. We gave him, Nascarand and Wolverine a ride back into Gorham and ran into Spidey, who I hadn't seen since NC, Puzzles who I met once in Damascus, and Gadget who I met once in Daleville. It was so fun to run into all of these guys more than a thousand miles further north!After dropping them off, we returned to Jackson for one more night with Pete and Em at their home.

They are very challenging.  Consistent climbs and descents with very little in between. I believe they are a tougher range than any in the White mtns. The only trail there that may compare is the Garfield Ridge Trail. In my opinion of course.  Mahoosuc Notch was actually fun though I wasnt very excited about it initially. If you don't know,  the mile through Mahoosuc Notch is alleged to be the toughest single mile on the AT. I might argue that the mile up Mahoosuc Arm immediately following the notch is more challenging. There was plenty of snow and ice left in pockets of the rocks and boulders.  That made for some very cool spots which were in stark contrast to the hot humid conditions of the day. You could actually see the cold air condense as it hit the warmer air above the ice. I had mentioned to Santa the possibility of laying up at Speck Pond depending on how I felt when I arrived.  I was really beat after a meager 9.5 miles when I got there.  I made a beeline for the water when I got here cause I just had to cool down. The swim felt great! Santa arrived shortly afterwards and announced that he was staying. I stayed too. This is a beautiful spot. I camped here once before years ago. I felt guilty laying up at 300pm but it was the right thing to do. I thought back to being at Thoreau Falls last week and how nice it would have been to camp there. I couldn't because I had somewhere to be. In the future when I go backpacking I'm going to plan like 7 mile days so I can camp in nice places and just hang out with nowhere to go.  That will be fun. Of course the weather will always be nice. The caretaker here,  Brandon,  has hiked the Pacific Crest as well as the Continental Divide. He is kind and unassuming.  He is the first person to get me to realize that my thru hike is almost over. That was actually shocking news to me. While I am so ready to do something other than hike,  I'm not sure I'm ready to end this trip. It is going to be one of those ready or not things. Right now I really want to go home.  After two days at home,  I'm sure I will want to come back. I don't know what to do about this or how to avoid it.  I believe it is an inevitable feeling. Again, ready or not...Tomorrow we will walk through Grafton Notch and out of the Mahoosucs. This will put me back in unknown territory.  I have never set foot on the AT north of there.

This morning we continued along some partially exposed ridges before crossing Rte 17 which yielded a great view of Mooselookmeguntic Lake (yes, you read that correctly). After that, it was up and down over low ridges, where I saw lots of evidence of moose activity. An hour of bushwacking would certainly have turned up at least one antler. Unfortunately the weather has deteriorated over the last two days with much rain, and fog today. I'm sad to say that my pack cover doesn't seem to be doing a very good job any more. I'm not so confident in my tent either for that matter. I'm hoping my gear and my psyche can outlast what remains.I have figured out that I have about 14 days of hiking left to do.

To some degree,  I'm burnt out.  All of my northbound buddies who are in Rangeley tonight have hiked 31 miles shy of 2000. Most if not all agree we are ready to be done. Lately we have been coming across large numbers of southbound thru hikers who started on Mt. Katahdin and are headed to Georgia.  I have probably passed about a hundred in the last week. They are all very excited and enthusiastic about their adventure. Everything is new and exciting for them.  They don't seem to mind the rain. Was I like that? Sometimes it seems like just yesterday that I started and sometimes it feels like forever ago. 14 days is nothing. This will end before I know it. Then I know I will be sad for sure even though this can't end soon enough. It is a very strange place to be emotionally.I will really miss being outside every day.  Even if it is wet. The wet adds an element of beauty to the landscape. The fog cloaks the woods to the point where you can be next to a pond and not even know it. It is cool, literally. Sometimes it is downright cold. I like Maine, always have. I like the AT in Maine even though I can bitch at every missed step. In the end it will be my favorite state on the trail.Wonder has decided to get back on the trail.

Dave must have enjoyed the hike because he called me this evening asking about the trail up to the Kennebec River.  Seems he has some interest in hiking more of the AT in Maine! Speaking of the Kennebec,  I crossed it today.  The crossing of this river is lore to me having read about thru hikers in the 60s and 70s who had to ford it to get across. They now have a guy who will Ferry you across in a canoe.  He works for the ATC so it is free for hikers. You have to get there between 9am and 2pm or else wait till the next day.  Fording these days is dangerous as they release water from dams upstream at random times for various reasons.I left Sandy Stream about 720am and easily made the 11 miles to the river by noon. This included a stop at Pierce Ponds which I highly recommend. I had planned to stop at Pleasant Pond shelter for the night hoping it would be like Pierce Pond but it wasnt anything close.  Pleasant Pond was anything but so after a dip in the pond and a snack,  I climbed the mountain and found this campsite around 500pm. Some people i met here going south said there were no other campsites for at least six miles so I layed up. I thought I would be alone but two couples wound up camping here as well. Since I was close to the summit,  I went back up for the sunset which was quite nice. I am so lucky to experience natural beauty every day.  If you can ignore the heat,  bugs, and discomfort of always being wet and sticky, there is no better place than the Appalachian trail in Maine. Yes, I admit it, I think Maine is nicer than New Hampshire. I will definitely miss my almost totally outdoor lifestyle when I finish the trail. A couple other highlights today included watching two loons on East Carry Pond, crossing the Kennebec, hiking with Un-careful and Fence for awhile, and meeting nice people at my camp tonight. Sleeping with the tent fly half off tonight so I'm ready for quick rain cover but can enjoy a little more air in the tent.","Crossing at Sandy Stream

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542489,"Today was another very humid day.  It's almost like the humidity hangs in the forest because when it was clear today the sky was very blue. I swear I am every bit as wet on a day like today as on a day that it rains.  If I knew my stuff would stay dry,  the rain would actually be preferable to the sweat. Maine is absolutely beautiful.  I love these woods, the exposed peaks,  and all the water.  I woke up on Pleasant Pond Mountain today and later crossed over Moxie Bald.  At only 2600 feet, this peak boasts 360 degree views with some really nice slab rock that you walk across. It is well worth the trip although I'm not sure it's easy to day hike there.Saw another large group of party southbounders today.  They make their 1130am starts and go shelter to shelter. So far I have had good luck not having to camp with these groups.  The party groups are like freshmen in college. Tonite I'm sheltered up with Nascar a northbounder,  and Fence and Un-careful two northbound flip floppers who will finish the trail next week. Thankfully there is nobody else here. We have plenty of room. The forecast calls for rain or I would be in my tent.Tomorrow I will get up early and try to cover the nine miles into Monson in time for breakfast. Ranger Ray should arrive midday. I am excited to have a hiking partner that I know and that knows me for the last part of the trip.I have less than ten days left and less than 125 miles to go. It is hard to believe. People on the trail congratulate me. I accept their well wishes. It feels good. I get emotional every time. It is odd. On to Monson and the storied 100 mile wilderness.

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542511,"Just a short day today. Like always, I am easily motivated by coffee and breakfast. Nascar was up right around 500pm so I got up then, packed up, and was hiking before 600am. I had to actually ford a stream today. It was the first time I couldn't rock hop so despite the light rain, I changed shoes and walked thru the Piscataquis river. Crispy and Apples were camped on the far shore so I talked with them while I changed back into the trail runners. They tipped me off to Pete's Place, a great bakery/restaurant in Monson. I covered the nine miles to the road and got a ride into town all before 1000am in plenty of time for breakfast. And let me tell you, it was good! If you ever come up here do check it out.I'm staying in a beautiful room at the Lakeshore House currently hanging around waiting for Ranger Ray to show up. I'm real tempted to zero here tomorrow just cause its nice and I can. I'll talk to Ray about it. Also staying here are Pack mule and Rachel whom I haven't seen since Central Virginia.

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543307,"Was awful tempting to zero in Monson today but opted to hit the trail instead.  There was a thick fog both in town and at the trailhead which lasted the first few miles of hiking.  This also made for some very slick conditions in the woods. At one point I had my foot placement all worked out but my pole touched that spot instead which caused my foot to move which then slipped causing me to fall hard on the side of my elbow.  This caused some pain and weakness for the rest of the day.  It also messed with my confidence thus increasing my level of caution. Some thunderstorms midday forced an early lunch in a conveniently located shelter. After that it was five miles to the next where we spent the night. Earl got in quite a bit after I did causing me some worry. All turned out to be well however. I'm concerned that our paces aren't as well matched as they were back in Georgia.  Well see what comes to pass. This afternoon I saw a mother Merganser with about a dozen ducklings in a small brook. That was cool to see.  Also walked by a few ponds.Tonight I'm camped with Ranger Ray,  Lost Pony, and Wee Gillis. There is also a flip flopper named Faceplant. When I looked at the guidebook tonight I saw that there are only 99.4 miles left to hike. My thoughts haven't changed.  I will truly miss this once I'm off trail but I can't wait to stop hiking.

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543308,"Had a plan to do 20.8 miles today in order to keep pace for arrival at Whitehouse Landing on Thursday and maintain the current plans to summit Mt. Katahdin on Monday.  Things went well but the terrain made for some slower going.  Ranger Ray and I agreed to meet at the shelter at the end of the day. He was confident he could make it so we headed out.  By 330pm, I had made it to the Pleasant River,  about 15 miles. Since nobody had seen Ranger,  I began to think about modifying the plan.  I walked another couple miles till I found a small camp a little off the AT around 500pm. I left a note on the trail for him in hopes that he would show up. By dark he had not so he either missed my note or camped up earlier. I am not happy to be separated by a night but I'm sure he is fine. Too bad cell service is so poor around here. I'm not sure  why they call this 100 mile stretch ""wilderness"". It is far from it. So far we have crossed railroad tracks,  roads,  and seen numerous people including day hikers in several places. At the river crossing today,  you had to ford it,  there were probably 15 to 20 people there all at once. It's really a busy place. Tomorrow we will effectively climb the last real mountains before Katahdin. I will also get my first view of the peak according to the guidebook. That will be exciting.  I'm sure I'll get all emotional.  Everything makes me that way lately, especially when I think about summiting or if people I meet on the trail congratulate me for hiking all the way from Georgia. I think it goes back to being proud of myself and being a bit incredulous that I may actually pull this off! I'm excited to see it though. I do sometimes wonder how I've managed to walk over 2100 miles. Who does that? Sometimes it seems like this trip has gone on forever and others like it has just begun.  Regardless,  tonight I'm camped by a brook listening to a barred owl hooting away. I can't wait to go home but I will really miss this life. The thru hiker life.","Long Pond Stream Shelter

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543310,"I hiked out very early this morning as I was awake wondering about Ranger Ray. I was on trail by 6 am and while I considered backtracking 2.5 miles to see if he had camped by the Pleasant River,  I decided it didn't make any sense.  I continued north to the next shelter, 3.5 miles away, where we had planned to stay the night before.  LP and Wee Gillis were still there when I pulled in for breakfast. I'm glad they were cause the Ranger had texted saying he had camped up at Chairback Pond, a couple miles south of the Pleasant River. At least now I knew he was fine and where he was.  I tried calling and texting him most of the morning while I had service but we never connected. I left him a note at the shelter, a phone message, and a text or two, then carried on.  Today's hike included the last mountains of significance before the climb up Mt. Katahdin. At the summit of Whitecap, I got my first view which basically melted me.  What a thrill to see the end after all these months of walking! It looked huge and too close considering I still had almost 70 miles to hike.  Some southbound hikers came by just at that moment and took my picture with the mountain in the background. Today is Wednesday and I believe I can summit on Monday or maybe Sunday.  The weather will play a role in deciding when to summit. I spent the afternoon hiking with Wee  Gillis which made the miles go quickly.","Campsite at mile 2107.0

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543312,"I parted ways with both Wee Gillis and Lost Pony today which will likely be for good. They pushed on and I took a shorter day to come to Whitehouse Landing where I had sent a resupply box. It is a nice old time camp on Pemadumcook Lake. They have dinner and a breakfast so I spent the night.  So far it seems like more of a no place than a yes place and while the people who run it are reasonably friendly,  they will not go out of their way to help you out. It is also quite pricey. Next time I hike the AT I won't come here. I will say it was pleasant to swim in the lake and have a beer this afternoon. Especially since it was quite hot. The hiking is pretty boring since it is mostly flat. The forest changes often.  There are many stretches of Hemlock and White Pine forest that are stately.  I pass lakes and ponds that only add to the scenic splendor. Today I watched a young bull moose feeding in a river. More beauty and peace. Maine is beautiful. It is my favorite state on the trail. It is tough however. I suspect if Maine were in the middle of the trail, it would take more thru hikers out. Did I mention I killed 95 deer flies the other day? My head is full of thoughts today.  More conflicting thoughts.  I want this to last forever.  It's time to go home.  It will be so strange to be in my house,  sleep in my bed,  not have to get up, pack up, move on. The thru hiker talk is now about when we will summit.  What day, our plans to arrive,  what we will do after.  For me,  I could finish in three or four days.  If I can hike 39 miles in two days,  I could summit on Sunday. If not,  I'll have three easy days to Katahdin Stream and summit on Monday.  As always I'll see what the days bring. This last 100 miles has some personal meaning to me.  If you know me,  you know that my Dad died two springs ago. I believe I mentioned somewhere in this journal that he was really responsible for instilling a love of the outdoors within me. Dad was very organized and quite the planner. He made this book for my brother and I with everything we would need to know and all of his last wishes upon his death. One of those was various places he wanted his ashes spread.  Since he first took me up Katahdin when I was seven years old, even though it was not on the list,  I decided to take part of him for a walk through the 100 mile wilderness and leave him on the summit.  I think he would like knowing this, I know he would like the actual hike, and I know he would be proud to know I had completed the trail.

I saw a number of my friends who summited including Magic, Spidey, and their crew as well as Lost Pony. They were all very excited. The hike yesterday was very easy,  in fact I covered the miles by two o'clock or so. At Abol Bridge,  I ran into Blaze whom I hadn't seen since Fontana Village.  I also caught up to Wee Gillis.

I had just caught up to Ranger Ray who had started the hike before me.  We talked a bit but I couldn't slow down. Usually at the end of the day I would slow down a bit to help transition into evening activities.  Today I finished strong. Last night at the hostel, I met a flip flop hiker named Honey Bear.  He carries a trumpet with him, everywhere. At the restaurant where we ate dinner,  a woman was celebrating her 70th birthday. He played the birthday song on his trumpet.  The whole place sang along. When he passed me on trail this morning,  I told him of my many disappointments at road crossings when I expected a band and a party waiting for me (yes, we have plenty of time to think and fantasize while hiking the AT, and it's all about us!). Later, as I was taking my final steps towards the summit,  he started playing the theme to Rocky, the other long distance hikers were hooting, hollering,  and clapping for me. I was experiencing some wild combination of laughing and crying.  I had done it,  I had hiked from Georgia to Maine! Norovirus be damned, I kissed that sign! Un-fucking believeable! It was a bluebird day.  We took lots of pictures and had some lunch on the summit.  We probably spent an hour up there as a group telling stories,  hanging out,  knowing that when we left the hike was over. The group I was with were not the ones I knew best on the trail.  Some of them finished before me,  and some will finish in the coming days. For me,  I am so proud to have completed this adventure. There were many times when I didn't think I could do it. And I mean many! But finish I have and now I have to go home which is all i have wanted to do recently.  I wonder what it will be like? If you have read this whole journal,  you will remember that back in January I made those lists suggested in the AT trials book. One of my statements was that I did not know if I would fit seamlessly back into my own life.  Now I will find out. I appreciate the many supportive notes that people have sent me along the way.

I am slowly running across friends in town and I dropped by my school today to check in. I wound up sitting in on some interviews for a new Dean of Students position they have added. The language of education is definitely still in my mind. Time to start thinking a little about that.Everyone talks about how the trail provides. I thought I would take a minute to thank some of the many people who helped me out over the course of the last five months. First and foremost, I want to thank my family. This includes my wife Ann who minded the house, the banking, the kids, and everything else she did in addition to going to work. She also came to visit me in Pearisburg, VA and I thanked her by being sick for two of the three days she was there. Again, sorry about that Ann. Also my daughter Aliza who came to visit me in Manchester, VT and again in New Hampshire. We spent a great zero day together and ate some good food. She and Ann also hiked a bit with me in the Presidentials. Thanks too to Sawyer, my son, who spent a three day weekend with me down in Pennsylvania at a time when I really needed a visit. We also had a zero day together and he was brave enough to do a 15 mile hike down there with me. I was ready to go home with him when he left me in Port Clinton but he refused to let me quit on his watch. Thanks to my brother Neil who looked after our mother in my absence, dealing with all of the details pertaining to her care. Also for his unending support which came in positive and motivational notes, posts, and the occasional phone call.Many thanks to my close friend, and now retired colleague, Deb ""Lady Grey"" Van Schaack, (AT Class of 2013) for her patience with me when I asked her ten million questions about the trail, gear, and everything else, prior to my departure. While our job was always busy, there was always time to talk about hiking!I want to thank Earl ""Ranger"" Ray, my local hiking buddy, for taking the time to come hike with me in Georgia and again in Maine. He gave me a great six day send off down south which put me on track to have a successful thru hike.

North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544444,"It has been nine days since I summited Katahdin. This evening, I’m sitting by the fire in my back yard. It is a beautiful night, warm, dry, and other than a few mosquitoes, very pleasant. I went for my first post AT hike today. It was a six mile round trip up Mt Abraham, a 4000 foot peak that is in my town here in Vermont. My wife Ann is out on an overnight to finish the Long Trail tonight. When she finishes tomorrow, she will have sectioned out the whole thing. She is proud of that. 
Today I hiked with my friend Jamie who was a good supporter while I was on the AT. She paced me and we had a leisurely hike up to the summit and back. Very different from thru hiking. Guess I’m back in the “real world”. And, in the real world, you have small world experiences! Today, while on the summit of a mountain 60 miles and more than a week away from the AT, I ran into Audubon and Quixote, two thru hikers whom I first met just north of Pearisburg, VA back in April. They were visiting Quixote’s Aunt who is someone I know from many years ago. Her name is Louise and she is married to a guy I went to grad school with. They live about an hour from here. I never expected to find thru hiker friends on Mt. Abraham! While we never really hiked together, we have many friends from the trail in common.
Speaking of friends, Large called me yesterday to check in. I was very pleased as I had been thinking I should call him. We talked about our hikes, how we were feeling about being back home, how our bodies felt post hike, and many other things. He said he was missing the trail life and that being back home was a bit of a challenge. He missed the trail, the outdoors, and people that knew first hand exactly what he has accomplished. I can empathize with all of that. While I have friends who are truly interested in my hike, and some who clearly aren’t, there are only a very few people around here who truly know how I might feel, about what I have accomplished. For myself, I feel very lucky that I have returned to a home where there are mountains and National Forest within a ten minute walk of my backdoor. After talking with Large, it occurred to me that I might feel very differently right now if I had returned home to a suburban or even urban landscape. I am very fortunate. I can take to the outdoors whenever I want to. It is right here in my backyard. I have seen moose in my driveway, bears have tipped over my compost bin, and deer are brave enough to eat the basil right out of my garden. I remember hiking with Quick one day. He had a theory about the important circles in your life and how if they intersected you had a good life. It was something like if you can recreate, work, and live within 15 minutes of each other, you pretty much had an ideal situation. I realize that I have this. I am lucky and I think this will help me transition back to life off of the trail. Large, or any of my other trail friends, you are always welcome if you need a fix of the great outdoors. Don’t hesitate to call, or come up.
As I take time to think about what I have done, who I am now, to some degree, I think I may be a bit more relaxed than when I left. I seem to be able to let things roll more and not be too focused on the tiny details. It will be OK I continue to tell myself. I feel like many things are possible. When I left, I felt pretty locked into work, town, friends. I seem to now have this notion that I can do anything if I so choose. Like getting a ride into town off the trail. Someone will always pick you up. Sometimes you wait longer than others but… it will be OK! Perhaps I am more confident. As mentioned previously, I am incredibly proud of myself for thru hiking the AT. I tell people this, I believe it. It makes me feel good to feel this way and say it. It is a genuine feeling. 
I am nervous about going back to work. I hope I will be patient when everyone wants something from me at the same time. With teenagers, it is all about them. With thru hikers like me, it became a lot about me. Can I return to placing others needs before my own? Can I tolerate organizational BS like I used to or will I be the blunt, too honest Northstar that many of my trail buddies know I can be? It may be a challenge… it will be OK.
Nine days back. I am figuring things out. It’s like starting a new thru hike in a place I’ve been a thousand times before. Time will tell, and… it will be OK. I will keep you posted as things develop. As I hopefully learn a few more things as a result of being a successful thru hiker. For now, I’ve applied for my 2000 miler status, I’m going to order some AT stickers for my truck, and, I might even get a tattoo. I’m that proud!",,Nine Days Back,"Aug 02, Tue",0

I’ve wished to be in the right place at the right time during deer season, I’ve wished for safe passage for my kids when they were going far away, especially driving, I always wish for good health, and for the past year, I’ve wished to successfully hike the Appalachian Trail in 2016. This required a lot of wishing, many nights in a row, and lots of hope for clear weather so I could continue to see the stars. Of course, the North Star is my favorite star to wish on. That was true long before I came up with a plan to hike the AT. You should try this some time. I’ll be the first to tell you it works! My kids are safe, I am healthy, I did bag a big buck the year I wished for it, and you know the outcome of my thru hike. Lately, with my first star of the evening I have kept it simple… “I wish to thank you”. I have thanked my lucky stars since I summited Katahdin, every night I see them, and other times too. Will, my nephew, asked me to share some inspirational thoughts from the trail at a recent family reunion I attended. It would be easy to say, make a wish on a star every night and they will come true but I have learned that it is not that simple. A wish may help you dream big and big dreams are the things that adventure are made of. So I’m here to say first and foremost, dream big! One of my sayings on the trail was “Not bad for an old guy!” One morning in Pennsylvania, A 20 something year old named King Arthur left camp before me. I was on my own at the time so I took care of business and set out on the days hike. An hour or so later, I came upon him sitting on a log taking a break. “Dude”, he said, “Nobody ever catches me or passes me”(he was a very fast hiker), “Not bad for an old guy!”. Boy, did he make me feel good! It was a little victory and I internalized it. Since I’ve been home, countless people have asked me about my hike. What I notice is that most of the people my age tell me that they could never do that. The reasons are easy, job, family commitment, too hard. Most of those are real reasons and I get all of them. However, if you let the framework of society box you in, if you create limitations in your own mind, the wish for the big dream adventure will never come true no matter how many stars you wish on. Even an old guy can roll with the kids, keep up, excel, and achieve a lifelong dream.Next inspiration, sometimes things just suck. On the trail that manifests itself as being wet for days in a row, being cold, hungry, tired, with no respite in sight. It is easy to ask yourself questions like “Am I stupid?” I could be sitting at home watching the Red Sox on TV. “Why the hell am I doing this?” Everyone thinks I’m crazy. They have to be right. For all the people that told me that a bad day of hiking is still better than a good day at work, I invite you to hike in the rain all day when the temperature is in the 40s, everything you own is wet, and the best you have to look forward to is a three sided structure that won’t keep the wet fog or cold out overnight. Sometimes the old office chair can look pretty good! The point is, you have to live through the bad in order to appreciate the good. A sunny warm day on the heels of a long stretch of wet reminds you that things do get better. They always get better. Your tent will dry, you will be warm, and you will get another chance to eat a real meal. Being wet is pretty low stakes. For those who are dealing with more serious issues, the point is, things will always get better, they have to. On the trail in Massachusetts last summer, I stayed at a place called Upper Goose Pond. They had a large cabin with bunks that people could stay in for free. They also offered free coffee and pancakes in the morning. There was pond that was clutch on the very hot day that I was there (I always hate going to bed sticky). When I woke up that morning, I looked across to the young woman in the bunk next to me who was sleeping soundly. Her water bottle was on the floor next to her and there was a small sticker on it facing me that simply said “It will be OK”. As you all know, this became my mantra, and it’s true.Maine became my favorite state on the hike. After years, decades really, of touting New Hampshire as the best state, the trail through Maine showed me there was much more to see and experience. It has the rugged mountains, the incredible forests, and adds the element of water. Once you’re north of the Bigelow range, there are lakes, streams, and ponds everywhere. It is beautiful. Perhaps because the end was nearing, I became very sensitized to the beauty that surrounded me. You could see it in vast sweeping views, and in tiny little aspects of ground cover. The first majestic view of Katahdin from Whitecap Mountain, lily pads rising above the surface of the water during an easy rain shower, the bubbles formed by the raindrops adding a dazzle to the scene, or a little red eft making its way slowly across the trail, its bright orange color in stark contrast to the green ferns that surrounded it. Beauty is everywhere if you take a minute to look for it. It is so easy to become consumed by the everydayness of everyday. One thing I have noticed is that I have a lot more stuff in my head since I have returned. It gets in the way of just experiencing what is happening around me. I am finding it annoying and distracting. Remember to take time to enjoy what is around you. A simple point that is often forgotten in daily routine.And on that note, I cannot forget the people. There were people everywhere that were willing to help me out, that took time from their day to do a favor for me. I met a man in Virginia while staying at a really dumpy hotel near the James River. He had just completed a cross country road trip and was waiting to move into a rental place in a nearby town. His take on the trip was that it was his life’s last hurrah before he became infirm, ill, and his life ended. He was only like 60 years old and this attitude shocked me. He was very generous with his time, bringing me to a grocery to resupply and waiting while I shopped, shuttling Grandma and I to trailheads so we could slackpack a day, and driving us to breakfast and dinner where we shared meals. He was lonely and depressed, seemingly estranged from his family. The morning we parted ways, we thanked each other. We thanked him for his generosity with his time and for helping us out. He thanked us for spending our time with him. He told us that we had given him a fresh perspective on his life, that he had been contemplating suicide and that we had inspired some measure of hope in him. I was again shocked that just being open and friendly to someone could have such an impact. I have never really been one to ask for help of others. That man taught me that in receiving you may well also be giving in ways that just aren’t obvious. Be open to the possibility of others, of new relationships. This becomes harder as you grow older. Fight hard, stay young at heart!While I am old enough to realize that the stars aren’t granting me wishes, I’m young enough to believe that maybe they could. The power is in the people, the beauty, the challenges, and the dreams. The trail gave this all back to me in middle age. While I finally accepted that I am no longer in my 20s, I learned that I can still hang with the kids, I can keep up, that they respect me as an equal and think I’m cool. I was reminded that I am strong, and that with determination, perseverance, big dreams, and a little luck, anything is possible. Find your trail, your inspiration, your dream, and jump right in. Live life with no regret and remember, it’s not too late, and it will be OK!",,Reminders from the AT,"Aug 15, Mon",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558694,"December 8, 2016. Let me count… 4 months, 14 days, or 137 days. My countdown is in reverse. I have nothing to look forward to. Last year 137 days meant until I left. There was planning, anticipation, anxiety, excitement, wonder! This year, 137 days means since I finished. It is December. In Vermont, winter is settling in. It will be cold this weekend with highs approaching 20 degrees. I go to work five days a week. I come home in the dark. I go to a fitness gym as much as I can and I hike on the weekends. This is a far cry from how many miles will I walk today? Where will I wind up? What’s the weather gonna do? Maybe someone will have trail magic at the road crossing? If I need a break, I could hitch into town for coffee or something. Who will I meet today? And of course, what’s for dinner and how much can I eat! I miss the trail. I miss meeting people who instantly accept me, who have funny names, who share the common goal of reaching Katahdin, of a challenge, the adventure of a lifetime. I miss Grandma, Large and In Charge, Slug, Six Legs, Gingersnap, Magic, Bigfoot the Good, The Big O, Jensen (what was his trail name?). I miss the Trash crew, the Rat Turds, Monkey and Merlin (Love conquers all Merlin!). I think about One Feather, Lost Pony, Quick, and I can never forget Phat Sister, Digger and Butter, Skittle and Dutch, Hubbell, the first thru hiker who I met at the train station in North Atlanta. We shared a ride, night zero in Dahlonega, got our picture taken together on Springer Mtn, crossed paths once more just south of Franklin, and never saw each other again. We both finished!!! In nine days, I will be equidistant in days from December 17, back to Katahdin (July 24), and to Springer Mtn on the other side (March 2). I can tell you something about almost every day I lived from March 2 to July 24, 2016. Outside of my daughter getting married, I can barely remember what I did from July 25 to December 8. WTF???I read posts on Instagram and Facebook. I keep up with a number of my trail friends in that manner and by text. I see their pictures. I post my own. Mostly of hikes I’ve done or events with my family I guess. We thru hikers have a common thread. We all miss it. We all did it! We are badass rockstars. We are humble and know something most people never will. We are resilient. We love being dry when it is pouring out. We aren’t nearly as hungry as we were! I stay connected through Appalachian Trials, through blog posts by Toast, Dutch’s summary video which I’m proud to be in. I can see what people are doing with their lives. Divergent interests, different paths. Pendexter is in Seminary school, Grandma is moving to San Francisco, Magic got a real nice buck in Ohio archery season, White Rabbit is a freshman at Swarthmore, Tenderfoot and Lays are getting married, Renaissance bought a van and never went to college, Santa and Wonder are adopting a five year old, Digger fell in love and travelled cross country. PCT next year they say! Wish I could go.After four months and change, I think I can begin to draw some conclusions, settle on some stuff I learned. Maybe the biggest is how locked into my life I felt before I left but never even knew it. At 54 years old, I stressed about a lot of stuff, money, my kids safety, my health, job security, working for the full retirement benefit. Since I’ve been back, it’s different. One of my hopes was to be more relaxed, stress less. While I haven’t mastered that, I believe I am noticeably better at it. I don’t sweat the little stuff as much, I don’t try to control absolutely everything. I totally avoid the drama at my job, it doesn’t get me anymore. LIKE!! What if I didn’t work my full thirty years? I’d have less money and more time. In a year and a half, my son will be out of college and I could really consider that! Do I have the guts to quit my professional job knowing full well that it’s unlikely I would get another? I am a thru hiker! I can do anything. It will be OK, right?Another thing I learned is that maybe time is more important than money, maybe living in the present has more value than planning for the future? If you like sports like I do, you probably watch some on TV. ACC basketball, Red Sox baseball and Patriots football all have one thing in common; financial companies love to advertise to guys like me during games. “Follow the green line to your retirement dreams”, “people don’t plan to fail, they just fail to plan”. How about this? Fuck Fidelity and fuck Prudential. I’m a good saver and I’m pretty sure I’ll never have enough money to retire with a boat on the lake, two bath tubs at sunset, and an unattainably hot middle aged woman seducing me into taking Cialis or whatever. I’ll settle for my pickup truck, my kit, and the girl I’ve been with for 30 years. Maybe I’ll be a short order breakfast cook, or put my counseling degree to work behind a bar? Work six months, hike the other six, try living in different parts of the country. I am a thru hiker. I can do anything, and it will be OK! (Posted in April 2017. Had to think on this awhile.)",,Day 137,"Apr 03, Mon",0
North Star,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593738,"Since the TJ website was updated, my written gear reviews did not make it back. You can see my list of gear at the gear link. Here are the thoughts I shared about the gear I used on my AT thru hike in 2016. I hope this is useful.  Northstar.Jet Boil Mini Mo Stove

I carried this stove for the duration of my recent Appalachian Trail thru hike.  It performed flawlessly. When I started using the mini mo I wondered whether the igniter would wear out during my hike.  It did not.  I used the plastic bottom cover as a bowl for eating breakfast daily. The stove worked especially quickly with a fresh fuel cartridge, boiling two cups of water in about 90 seconds.  As the fuel level got lower, it seemed to take longer to boil.  The cartridges lasted a long time.  I actually used a medium sized one all the way from Front Royal, VA into Connecticut. You could extend the life of the cartridge by steeping meals in the pot for part of the meal’s required simmer time.  I cooked a lot of Knorr rice sides which called for 7 minutes of simmer time.  I usually simmered for like two or three minutes, then let the meal finish itself with no flame.  This saved gas for sure. While this stove kit is a little bulky in the backpack, its performance far outweighed any packing concerns.  I would keep the burner, a small bottle of Dr. Bronners, and a small sponge and scrubby in the pot while packed and still had room to pack a bottle of Mio in there as well.  I packed the fuel cartridge separately. I never had any trouble with the stove in cold weather although the coldest I dealt with was temps in the high teens. I would highly recommend this stove to anyone considering a long distance hike.

 Salomon XA Pro 3D Trail runners
These shoes are lightweight and rugged. They are torsionally rigid and have a decent tread pattern although the tread is not very deep. The toe cap is very rugged which was very helpful on rocky terrain. I opted for the non gore tex model which lets water in quickly but also dries quickly. The asymmetrical Kevlar laces do not allow for easy changes of the lacing pattern which isn’t ideal.  However, they will never wear through.  The shoe fabric wore out far faster than the laces although I did not wear them long enough to develop the gaping holes that I have seen in some pictures of heavily worn pairs. The heel linings may rip with prolonged use.

I have a love hate relationship with these shoes.  While there were times I hated them, I used four pairs from Hot Springs, NC to Mt. Katahdin.  Last year’s model had a tongue construction that wrapped across the top of your foot and was sewn in along the bottom in two places on each side.  I had read that some people had trouble with these causing pain in the sides of the feet.  My first pair, which I bought at Bluff Mtn. Outfitters had this style tongue.  The tongue itself actually folded over itself on top of my foot and created some significant pressure and pain.  I actually had to change the lacing pattern to alleviate this situation which I did on the side of the road one day.  There is a great You Tube video on how to do this which I had watched the night before.  When I got to Daleville, VA, I went to the outfitter and asked about a replacement pair.  They had a pair in my size and what I first noticed was that Salomon had changed the tongue construction of this year’s model to a more traditional design. While the clerk at the store was less than helpful, he did give me the number for Salomon customer service who authorized him to replace the old pair for free.  Thank you Salomon!  I tend to wear shoes right on the ball of my foot based on how I walk.  By the time I had hiked 550 miles in this pair, I could feel every stone through the sole so rather than hiking the last 100 miles of Pennsylvania in those, the really rocky part, I had REI send me a new pair which I started wearing in Port Clinton.  The toe box of this pair started coming apart from the sole in southern Vermont.  A call to REI about that resulted in another replacement pair being sent to me.  I used that pair for the rest of the trip, about 500 miles and am still using them now.  They have held up very well. Thanks REI! These shoes may rip in the heel lining like many other shoes.  I solved this problem by lining the heel of the shoe with a piece of gorilla (duct) tape.  After doing this, I had no trouble with the lining, or any blistering on my heels.

I did use carbon superfeet in my first pair which netted me a shin splint and an unwanted five day vacation from hiking. I would not recommend superfeet in any form. I had trouble with two different pair of them, the other causing blisters on the sides of my heel where the plastic of the heel cup cut into my foot.  I would, however recommend a trip to Walmart and the Dr. Scholl’s orthotic machine.  Those inserts combine arch support with a gel heel cup that provides padding and reduces problems from heel striking. The cost is the same as a pair of superfeet and they are sized based on an analysis of your foot. I bought a pair in Waynesboro, PA and used them all the way to Katahdin, over 1100 miles.  They were very helpful. While I thought of trying different shoes, I wound up sticking with the XA Pro. Despite some trouble with the earlier model, I highly recommend these trail runners for any long distance hiking adventure.

 

Superfeet

Don’t bother with superfeet. They did nothing but cause problems for me at 50 bucks a pair.  As mentioned above, visit a Walmart and use the Dr. Scholl’s machine to evaluate your foot and go with the recommended size.  These inserts provide arch support and gel to pad your heel. They are comparable in cost to superfeet and far more comfortable.  
 

Darn Tough Wool Socks

Merino wool sock with nice cushioning. These are the first socks Ive ever used without a liner sock.  I used two pairs of the full height socks with my mid height gore tex boots for the first 275 miles of the trip when it was cold and I hiked in snow three times.  Those socks still look like new.  I switched to quarter height Darn Tough socks when I switched to low cut trail runners. I used two pair from Hot Springs to Delaware Water Gap, almost 1000 miles. No holes in those but they did wear thin.  I bought two new pair in DWG which I used all the way to Katahdin.  Again, some wear but no holes at all.  Darn Tough has a lifetime guarantee so buy them once, wear them forever.  Made in Vermont. What’s not to like!

 

Osprey Exos 58 pack

I was very pleased with the performance of this pack for the duration of my AT thru hike. I used it for a total of eleven days in the 2015 hiking season and my entire thru hike in 2016. This pack held up very well.  The only thing that wore through were the loops that connect the hip belt to the lower shoulder strap.  The purpose of those loops is to keep the hip belt open when you are putting on the pack.  I noticed them fraying through after 1700 miles and contacted Osprey. The technician informed me that there would be no effect on the carry of the pack so I did not worry about it.  They did wear through and Osprey said they would repair the pack free of charge if I sent it back to them. Outside of this I had absolutely no problems with this pack.  All the stitching held up well and overall the pack showed very little wear after almost 2300 miles of total use.  The only thing missing is a pocket to hold a more modern phone. I had to buy a detachable pocket for my Samsung S5 phone in order to carry it conveniently on a strap.  The 58 liter capacity was enough to carry all of my winter gear and up to seven days of food which I only had to do once in the Smokies. It had more than enough room once I traded out my winter stuff and was only carrying three or so days of food. I like to pack everything inside of my pack with nothing hanging on the outside.  The 58 allowed me to do this easily.  My only complaint would be that the side pockets are tight if you carry a wide water bottle like a Nalgene. It is also tedious work to insert and remove a camelback bag and its hose from the internal pocket which I did nightly in camp.  The outside pocket material also can rip easily if you rub up against sharp sticks.  I saw a lot of Exos packs on the AT and would highly recommend this model for anyone undertaking a long distance hike.

 

Sea to Summit Ultra Sil Pack Cover

I used two of these covers over the course of my AT thru hike.  The first one I bought using the size guideline provided by Sea to Summit.  This cover fit very tightly and actually tore when I rubbed up against some thin branches one day.  Sea to Summit graciously replaced this cover for me with the larger size in Damascus, VA. The larger one lasted all the way to Katahdin however, its performance trailed off the longer I used it.  It is very lightweight but you may want to get a heavier cover that may have a better coating for longer lasting performance.

 

Therma Rest Neo Air Sleeping Pad

This pad performed very well for me for the duration of my AT through hike.  I did not have any trouble until after I finished when I did find a small tear which I should be able to easily fix with a Tear-Aid patch (provided with the pad when you buy it).  It is heavy and if I had wanted to trim my base weight, I could have traded this out.  However, it is wicked comfortable!  It is also very warm in colder temperatures.  It does make a lot of noise when you roll over on it.  Another hiker called it my “thunder pad” because it was so loud when I moved on it.  I found that it was louder when you set it up on another nylon surface such as a tent floor, or a ground cloth which I did use to protect the pad on shelter floors. It made less noise if you laid it directly on the shelter floor.  The advertisement says it inflates in less than 20 breaths.  I guess my lungs aren’t that good because it usually took me more than 30. 
 

Feathered Friends Swift UL20 Sleeping Bag

This is a great bag that has excellent loft and packs down to a very small size.  I had hoped to be toasty warm right down to 20 degrees but unfortunately this was not the case.  While I was never truly cold in this bag, I was cool, especially my feet, when temperatures dropped into the lower 20s.  When temps were around 30 or higher, I was very comfortable all night long in this bag.  For the price I paid for the bag, I was somewhat disappointed in its performance however I never did anything about it. I used this bag from Springer Mtn. up to Front Royal, VA where I switched to a lighter bag. You probably don’t need to spend this much on a sleeping bag but the 900 weight down did allow for a 20 degree rated bag to weigh only 2.0 pounds.  The only other bags on the market like this are Western Mountaineering bags which are comparable in price. The choice is yours.

 

Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2 tent

I carried the Fly Creek UL2 for the duration of my AT thru hike in 2016.  This was a very popular model and I saw many of them on the trail.  I did opt to buy the matching footprint for the tent. Overall I was very pleased with its performance although it became less water repellent the more I used it.  I do wish that the fly was cut so the bottom was closer to the ground.  In the rain, water could, and did, splash up onto the tent itself which caused some wetness to enter the tent. It is a semi free standing tent which makes for some challenges, especially when setting up on a tent platform.  I never felt like I could get this tent as taut as I would have liked it.  Also, while it is called a 2 person tent, I would never want to share it with another person.  It fit me and my stuff comfortably. A second person would be incredibly tight.  It you want to camp with a friend, buy the three person model.  The best thing was the personal space my Fly Creek afforded me.  As I liked to say, my tent was the only 18 square feet of personal space I had on the trail.  I definitely recommend Big Agnes and the Fly Creek UL line.  If I get a 3 person tent, I will likely look at the Copper Spur as well.

 

Montbell DownHugger 800 #5 Sleeping Bag

A very lightweight 40 degree rated bag.  The 800 fill power down really did keep me warm to roughly 40 degrees although once or twice, I felt a little cool.  This was usually when sleeping in shelters on foggy, wet nights.  I cannot remember feeling cold at all when I used this bag in my tent. On warmer nights, I used it as a blanket with great results. This bag weighs 22 ounces and packs down very small.  It has some kind of unique stitching that is supposed to make it stretchy but I didn’t notice any huge advantage to that.  I really like this bag and highly recommend Montbell to anyone.  It is the first piece of their equipment I have ever had. A+!

 

Leki Corklite Trekking Poles

I used these poles every step of the way on my AT thru hike in 2016.  While I was a recent convert to the idea of using poles for hiking at all, my Corklites led me to conclude that I will never backpack without them again.  They saved me from rolled ankles on at least half a dozen occasions.  They also prevented numerous potential falls and took much pressure off of my knees on extended descents.  At one point, I had one of them bent over with a full arc in it while avoiding a fall.  That pole snapped back to straight immediately with no sign of damage at all.  The compression locks only came loose once and that was the result of being flipped open by a branch of some sort.  They never ever slipped outside of that.  After almost 2200 miles, outside of cosmetic scratches, and worn baskets and tips, they are in fine shape. If anyone asked me what the most valuable piece of equipment in my kit was, my Leki Corklite poles would take first prize hands down.  I recommend them unconditionally and enthusiastically!",,View Entry,"Jun 11, Mon",0
