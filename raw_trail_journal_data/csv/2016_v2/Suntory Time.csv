Suntory Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521826,"Hi,
Just wanted to start my first post. 
I'm headed down to Georgia on March 15th on Amtrak's ""The Crescent"" from Phili's 30th Street Station. 
I'm getting off at Gainsville, GA and will be picked up by The Hiker Hostel. 
I'm starting at Springer on March 17th. 
I was actually able to score s roomette on Amtrak for just a small amount of additional cash. I get dinner and breakfast free and I also get to use the Club Acela Lounge at 30th Street Station at Philadelphia. I'm looking forward to the lounge, but I'm going to look a bit out of place. 
Amtrak has regulations that you can't take anything flammable and you can't bring a knife on board, even a pocket knife. I'm going to attempt to legally mail myself a butane fuel cartridge to Georgia as well as send my Victorinox knife in a pouch in the mail separately. 
Over the next couple of days, I'm going to put my things in storage. I have rented a storage unit for my things. 
I'm writing this using my iPhone. I intent to use it for photos and videos as well as Guthook's hiking guide. I plan to communicate as much as I can on the trail. 
Looking forward to the hike.",,Starting out March 17th. ,"Feb 28, Sun",0

So I did the SOBO slack pack from Kinsman Notch back to NH 25C. I got on the trail before 9am after getting the shuttle to Kinsman Notch. The climb from the north side was very steep. I could not use hiking poles in certain sections. But I did get close to Beaver Brook. It was getting hot and I was able to get a good soak in Beaver Brook after crossing on rocks. Refreshing. Then it was on to the summit. I encountered the ""traveling hubcap"" being transported by a NOBO. The hubcap had already finished the PCT and was well on the way to completing the AT. It was nice up there. Quite a view of the Presidential Range where I am heading soon. Then on to the South Peak and the more gradual south side back down to NH route 25C. It looks like I might have missed the shuttle to the store. I hope I can convince the caretaker to make another run.","Welcome Hiker Hostel

Suntory Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543305,"When I got back to the hostel after my slack pack over Moosilauk they were kind and made a run to the store. It rained soon after I was in for the night. This morning my hike from the Hikers' Welcome Hostel started pleasantly enough. There was a steep climb from the road after fording a stream. As I hiked up higher and closer to Mount Wolf I saw a moose in a small clearing. I had heard there was one in this area. But apparently it has become disoriented after climbing up this high and can't remember how to get down. I heard later from other hikers that the wildlife people are aware of the situation. It was hot and windy and as I got close to Mount Wolf I began to hear thunder. Then it got scary as I was near the summit and suddenly there was lightning very close to me. I set my hiking poles down and I sat under the large boulder (where you get a nice view) until it seemed this storm had moved away. My dad checked Dopler radar and texted me that another storm would be coming from Vermont but I had time to get over the summit. So I pushed on quickly. Soon after I got down from the summit, it began pouring. Soon the trail resembled a river and in some places a pond. I was soaked. But at least the danger of lightning strikes seemed to be over. I got to Eliza Brook Shelter around 6PM and it was full. I managed to get tent site #5 and built a diversion dam to channel water away. Whoever had site #2 was not so lucky. The brook was in flood stage. SOBO hikers told me that it was terrifying on Kinsman Mountain. There was hail in addition to lightning. Two hikers forded Eliza Brook and it was waist high. I hope the water goes down by tomorrow. I was sorry to find the bottom of my pack was not dry and especially my spare socks. Time for a laundry line and hope my stuff dries. This is one of the most difficult days on the AT so far. Way harder than snow in North Carolina.","Welcome Hiker Hostel

Suntory Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543425,"After all the weather drama yesterday, this morning was bright and clear. But it took me too long to get up and pack all the still-wet gear and get on the trail. Fortunately the Eliza Brook water level had gone down overnight. But it was still gushing. There were many opportunities for swimming in the brook but I was getting a late start and needed to get up the trail. I had planned to get to Franconia Notch but that was before I ran into Kinsman Mountain. Maybe I was tired from yesterday but this mountain really kicked my butt. I finally made it to the South Peak around 2pm but it became obvious to me that I was not going to make it to Franconia Notch without a night hike. The descent would have been terrible in the dark. I got to the North Peak but had no cell phone signal. But I used InReach to text my dad and ask him to cancel my reservation at Notch Hostel for tonight. They did this and did not charge me and I am grateful. I'll be there tomorrow for sure. I descended from Kinsman Mountain and decided to stay at Kinsman Pond. It was $10 but only three others were there. The pond was beautiful and I was ready for a swim. The first 100 feet from the shore were lily pads but then it was deep. The water was cold but it felt good to swim. Now I am watching darkness fall on this beautiful place. It feels like the Parc de la Verendrye in Quebec except with mountains. Living the northern summer.","Eliza Brook Shelter

Suntory Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543977,"I had an easy hike from Kinsman Pond to the road crossing of I-93 at Franconia Notch. I had a reservation for the Notch Hostel and it took a long time to get there from the Notch. One shuttle said they were at the parking area but did not see me. Hey, I was there. No worries I got to the Notch Hostel. Had a nice dinner and saw Star Trek Beyond in Lincoln. But I was really crashing and decided to head to the successor to the Comfort Inn. Now comes the hard part. I am told that you don't quit on a bad day. So I decided to leave the trail on a good day. My dad came up to meet me and we did the slack pack from Mount Liberty to Mount Lafayette after a zero. I need to say that the problem for me was mostly financial. I am just burning through too much money up here in New Hampshire. Robbing Peter to pay Paul was the way it was going. Then I had that bad experience with the lightning on Mount Wolf. I got through that. When my dad made it to Lincoln after a long and hot journey from NY we decided to do a slack pack to Mount Lafayette. Wednesday was a beautiful day. I made it up to Liberty Springs Campsite. Then I hiked north on the Franconia Ridge. I got up Little Haystack and then Mount Lincoln. My dad came the other way and was waiting for me on the Mount Lafayette summit. So we looked out 100 miles and could even see the Adirondacks on the far horizon. But it was also sobering to think about how it might be to have to get down before a thunderstorm rolled in. No storm today though. The forecast tomorrow was not so good. So it was time for me to go down the side trail to Greenleaf Hut and off the trail. Sad to say I actually fell on a steep and stony part of the Old Bridle Path back to the parking lot. The White Mountains have won this round but I will be back. So I have ended my hike. At the same time I have joined the many section hikers who come out and do sections year after year until they have hiked the Appalachian Trail. I do plan to complete the AT however many years it might take me to do it. And I have an unopened bottle of Suntory whiskey that will be unopened until I finally complete the trail and reach the Katahdin summit. I have gained so much from my journey. For those of you that have been on the trail with me through my journal I am happy to have shared this amazing experience and I am honored that you made the journey with me.","Lincoln, NH

Suntory Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554561,"After a lot of thought, I have decided to continue and finish my hike of the Appalachian Trail. Last year, I started on the Amicalola Falls and ended my southern portion of my hike at Possum Creek in Virginia, near Atkins Virginia. I also restarted hiking last summer 2016 at North Adams, Massachusetts, which is the final road crossing before you enter the Vermont section of the Appalachian Trail. I hiked from there into the Whites and stopped at Lincoln, New Hampshire. 
At the end of October, I hiked a large section of the AT in Connecticut. I hiked two day hikes and a two night trip from Southern Massachusetts to Salisbury, Connecticut. It felt good to be back on the trail and I'm sorry that I had to end my hike in New Hampshire. 
So, I am going to restart my hike at Possum Creek and hike north in Virginia. I can't wait to restart, and I am going to head down to Virginia from my home in Upstate New York around Mid March. I'm hoping that the weather will be good and that I can get up to speed faster as I weighed more last year. 
I will share the story of all of my upcoming travels with all of you. I will be taking my iPhone with me and I will write in my blog while I am on the trail. I am looking forward to getting to Maine in late July early August. I want to swim every day which is what I did many times on the AT last year.","Possum Creek Parking area
