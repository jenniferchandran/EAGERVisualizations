Cake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520957,"Well, let see. Why am I hiking The Appalachian Trail. First things first, the adventure. I haven’t been on an adventure since I don’t know when. I am going to have the time of my life. I’ll see beautiful sunsets, and awe inspiring sun rises.I can’t wait to meet and make new friends. I’m also going to meet myself again; the younger, funnier side of me, like I used to be in my teens.I will re-learn self-reliance; how to pitch a tent quickly in the rain without getting too wet. I will also learn how to gratefully accept help from friends and trail angels.Many thanks to my wonderful husband, Jeff. He has put up with the almost non-stop talk of walking the trail for 4 years now. He has been a sweetheart for supporting me in this dream. He’ll be seeing me off at Harpers Ferry in May.Cake","

Cake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521937,"This was my third time camping at Fort DeSoto Park. But, it was my first time camping without my golden retriever, Daisy. Very quiet this time. Also, this was a gear check trip. 
The Big Agnes tent is amazing. Easy to set up and take down. Practiced that many times. The first night it rained, (awesome). Tent held up fine and most important, I stayed dry.  
Brought both sleeping bags but used the warmer of the two. The temps at night were around 45-50, so I was pretty warm.
Sleeping pad was awesome. Self-inflates fast. Packs up nice and small, but I think I’ll get one of those Therm-a-Rest Z Lite Sol mattresses and use both. I know that’s extra weight (10 oz.) but I need to get a good night’s sleep. Also I am a side sleeper and need the extra padding for my boney shoulders.
My cooking set up works well, especially the wind screen. I can see why everyone recommends having one. I used alcohol as fuel and I think I’ll use it on the trail. Ate the usual foods on my three day adventure; oatmeal, potatoes, rice and noodle sides.
Did some walking…….. 
The funny thing is--- everything worked great or better than expected; except the phone charger. Not too bad.  
The count-down has begun. Only seventy-four days to go before I start my Appalachian Adventure.

Cake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526910,"Good morning one and all, “A dreamer named Benton MacKaye imagined a footpath running along the eastern mountains, from New England to the southern Appalachians. In 1921 Benton MacKaye proposed building a system of trails along the ridges of the Appalachian Mountains. His dream eventually became what is today's Appalachian Trail” A trail that stretches for some 2,190 miles between Maine and Georgia.”  http://bmtguide.com , Step by Step (An Introduction to Walking the Appalachian Trail, By the staff of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy)I will begin my adventure in 33 days. I find I'm so excited, I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.","

Cake,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529750,"Hello everyone,
Only two weeks till the adventure begins. Can't hardly wait. Been packing and re-packing my backpack. Trying to get the weight down. It's 10 pounds base weight (pack, sleeping bag, and tent). Not too bad. 13 pounds without food or water, so it's not too heavy. 
Been hiking a bit. The beach is beautiful this time of year. Should be around 85 today. Nice. 
Can't wait to meet other hikers and make new friends along the A.T.
