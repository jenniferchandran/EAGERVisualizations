"JBlock,Glock&RTOs ",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539040,"JBlock:Lists, lists, lists. Mental lists......Working overnights in LE has given me ample time to use my downtime to watch 3 million YouTube videos, read countless articles until my eyes bleed, Google Map our every step and yes, lists! Bear spray, mobile sirens, maps, maps, maps. Check, check, check. I find myself thinking about our hike every single day now. Is the day REALLY almost here? Should I really be taking on a new adventure of this magnitude at my raggedy age??One thing is for sure, the more prepared I am on paper~the more my mind wanders to the practical day to day. Am I REALLY prepared? I don't consider myself to be someone who's afraid of things that go bump in the night, but am I completely completely kidding myself? Will I in fact turn into Daddy's little girl night one? Will I let my ID channel addiction get the best of me and rapidly deploy physical tactics and training on a well meaning stranger simply because he came out of nowhere like BOO!!?? LOL. In advance I feel somewhat sorry for the people that will meet me. I didn't mean to body slam you into a rock pile, I swear Glock: BANG!!!",,Day One,"Jun 21, Tue",0

"JBlock,Glock&RTOs ",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540344,"JBlock: Holy friggin kamikaze mosquitos in NJ. Drowing in bug spray and they still attacked from every direction last night. Could not get in our tent fast enough!! Slept in nice wooded area before reaching the 1st shelter to avoid crowds. #oldmanhiker216 advised us that it was full to the max. Swapped our 4man tent for a friend's 2man tent to cut weight and SO much yes! Thanks #Craig!! Breakfast is served, oatmeal, coffee and Cliff bars. Hittin the road errrrr trail soon. Today stairway to Heaven, High Point State Park, Unionville NY for dinner and some beers at Wits End Tavern...then??? Surviving JUST FINE without my hair straightener. My bf and travel partner is LOVING this JetBoil! Can't wait to see his glee when we stop to re-supply on water and he gets to use his trusted filter. Managed to hang food high in a tree without 550 cord. Hoping they sell some in Unionville. Didn't come here to climb trees  Peace out!!","BRICK ROAD SHELTER
