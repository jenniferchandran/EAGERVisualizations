Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521624,"Hey folks! I wanted to thank everyone for coming by to read my trail blog. This site is intended to serve as my personal journal as well as a vessel through which others that are unable can join me on this adventure. I will share my thoughts, fears, hopes, desires, pains, joys, sorrows. Or perhaps just idle observations about trees and ferns and millipedes and things. Just kidding. (But seriously).Your interest is important to me! As it is all of your collective interest & support that will help to keep me motivated in this difficult (and incredible!) months ahead. That said, I'm so very excited to get this show on the road.I wanted to especially thank everyone who is donating to Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation by way of pledging at my hikefor page (http://www.hikefor.com/Deadwood/AT/2016). ALSF is an awesome charity that helps children with cancer & funds cancer research.Recently, I read the book ""A Walk For Sunshine"" by Jeff Alt, and I decided I would hike for charity. Because, well, why not? I've dreamt of thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail for about a decade. It never felt like it was something that would ever happen - until last summer.That's when I read Zach Davis' ""Appalachian Trials"", and his words really resonated with me. The timing wasn't exactly perfect, but my wife helped me make it work. The money would be incredibly tight, but I would be more frugal. Sacrifices have to be made for something this epic & demanding to come to fruition, and not just my own. But either I push the boat out now, maybe without everything I need to stay afloat, or I wait until I retire. Worst case scenario, I can dog-paddle.Poor boating metaphors aside, waiting your entire working life to complete your biggest & hungriest goal is no way to live. It'll be difficult, physically, mentally, socially and again mentally. But I at least have to try and give it my all. If I fail, then fine. But not trying at all is the only failure I refuse to accept.If you want something badly enough, you truly can make it happen. Even if it's selfish. And this is undoubtedly just that. This journey is an inherently egocentric one. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's immoral, wrong, misguided or can't also simultaneously be something very good.If I'm going to leave everyone behind for five months to go for this crazy pipe dream that I could never seem to shake, (I tried), than the least I can do is help someone else out. Every step I take when I'm freezing, starving, aching and lonely, I'll take another for ALSF. For the children who didn't get a chance to meet their goals, and for the ones who might. Go read about some of them at http://www.alexslemonade.org/heroes.One step at a time. Just one step at a time.Thanks for reading folks, seeya next time!",,View Entry,"Feb 22, Mon",0
Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521769,"One of the first questions people ask is why. Why would you want to go out into the wilderness for five months, away from your friends & family, freeze your butt off, get rained on, deal with blisters, sores, cuts & bruises, constantly being hungry, lightning, physical & mental fatigue, sleeping on the ground, struggling in the cold and the heat, and so forth.It’s a fair, simple question that unfortunately doesn’t warrant an equally simple answer. Why am I thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail? Because, over the last decade, it's the one thing that I could never get out of my head. From the day that I found out from a thru-hiker that it was possible I just felt a need to do it. Not because I am running from something, like some hikers. It’s not escape that I’m looking for. It’s because I'm running toward something.How many of us actually, truly push ourselves beyond what we think we're capable of? Take ourselves to the edge of exhaustion, then ask our bodies and minds to keep going? It’s in those moments that we find out what we’re made of, and maybe, who we really are. I don't feel like many Americans experience any sort of major rite of passage these days, with the exception, I would say, of our military & veterans. Hats off to each and every one of them. But for the rest of us, we are either never tested, or we find something that takes us far out of our comfort zone. It’s not just about being uncomfortable. It's about being uncomfortable and being okay with it. Challenges are opportunities for growth. I hope to come back different than I went in, and I suspect I will. Firm this rant up, Mr. Eliot.“We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.” - T.S. EliotNow we’re getting somewhere. I should’ve started with that quote? But we’re not done. Here’s another, slightly more modern quote to sum it up. “Life is short. Do awesome shit, stupid."" - Zach Davis, author of “Appalachian Trials”Thanks T.S. Thanks Zach. Now here’s my quick list.I am thru hiking the AT because...It has been my life goal for over a decadeI will have the rest of my life to sit in front of a computerI love nature & singularity of focusIt is my rite of passageWhen I successfully thru hike the AT, I will...Be a much more confident & patient manWill have better perspective on my life and my place in the worldHave no regretsWill have the attitude to persevere in whatever I do in lifeHave the story of a lifetimeIf I give up on the AT, I will...Have abandoned a decade-long dream. But I would have the maturity to accept that the goal is no longer as valuable or desirable to me. Values change and that's okay. At least I will have given it my best effort.",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Wed",0
Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522209,"So what’s the deal with trail names? Why do we do it? How does it happen? Where did it begin?It’s a tradition for hikers, and especially long-distance hikers, to take on trail names. I really don’t know where or how this began,but why not participate in something so whimsical? There is a sticking point though.Typically trail names are given, not chosen, and often they are related to something embarrassing that happened to you or that you did. Otherwise, obviously, I would be something along the lines of “World’s Sexiest Dudeman” or perhaps “Super Coolguy J. Rich” or maybe “Macho Libre” (is he joking?). But that just won’t do. I never would have settled on “Deadwood”, but there is always a logic behind the new title.When hiking up Mt. Mitchell for a weekend backpacking trip with some of my best buds, I was the only one left that didn’t have a trail name. Mt. Mitchell is the highest mountain east of the Mississippi, and I was feeling the elevation gain. I was also the only one without trekking poles (these bad boys take 15 pounds off of your knees). Feeling left out of the cool-guy / smart-guy trekking pole club, I rooted around the fringes of the trail until I found two woody, gnarly, poor substitutes for trekking poles. Not ideal, but I happily used them for the remainder of the weekend and I still maintain that they (maybe!?) helped my knees. At the end of the hike, Smiling Otter & Seal donned me “Deadwood”. And so I shall remain!",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Tue",0
Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524916,"This morning was surreal, but now it's real. The journey of a lifetime has begun. It's exciting, but it's hard not to question it all now that I'm way out here, so far from the ones I love. I got my tent setup with plenty of daylight left, was just sitting in there getting things organized and felt suddenly very alone. I already miss my wife so much - she makes everything worth it. That said, I know this doubt and fear will pass. The hiking today wasn't too bad, but, barring injury, I can already tell this is going to be a mental game. There are some folks here that I'm going to hang out with for dinner. Update: I talked to Wan (Wanderer), Sylvan & Bryson. All seem nice, and Wan is awesome at ukulele. I recognized some of the tunes he was playing as songs from the ""Into the Wild"" soundtrack by Eddie Vedder. Turning in at 7:30. Rain coming in tonight.","Springer Mountain
",Hawk Mountain Campground,"Mar 12, Sat",7.40
Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524917,"This was one of the toughest days in recent memory. Woke up in a wet tent, broke down in the rain & mud. Only my electronics and clothes were dry. It was a very misty, wet morning as I hiked. Met another hiker named Chris, who was only wearing sandals on his feet. The rain finally cleared off, but I'm worried about rain again tonight. There are no designated campsites left, and I'm set up on a slope.Today I hiked with Wild Child and her dog, Panda. She's very nice and was great company as I hiked. I ended up motivating her to continue to the shelter. Her pack was as large as her.I talked to some folks at the shelter, which was full. They seemed nice, but I'm having trouble connecting with big groups. I don't have an appetite yet, and I ran out of fuel halfway through heating up dinner. I at half cooked noodles and it was horrible.Fingers crossed for a clear night.","Hawk Mountain Campground
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Mar 13, Sun",8.70
Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524919,"No rain last night, but have had off and on sprinkles today. I felt awesome, and got my first trail magic, too. I was walking by when a guy named Sticks asked if I wanted a pancake. He brought an outdoor stove and had a bag for trash. I was taken off guard because it was my first trail magic, but he asked if I wanted chocolate chips in my pancake and I said ""yes."" He thru hiked last year. I saw the legendary Miss Janet drive by and honk her horn, but I didn't talk to her. Later in the day, I ran out of TP, so it was a new first using leaves. I opened up to a lot of people today, and it paid off. People out here are truly nice. There's SpaceGoat, Jai, Reeses, Scurvy, Josh, Irie, Moses, Get Weird, Hi-Ho, Beaver, and a few others. Beaver tented next to me, and he's only 17 but he's got his head on straight. Tomorrow is Neel's Gap and onwards. Yahoo!","Gooch Mountain Shelter
",Lance Creek,"Mar 14, Mon",8.50
Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524920,"Today was awesome. Hiked out of Lance Creek with Hi-Ho and found we have a similar pace. We'll probably keep on together for awhile, and split a room in Hiawassee. Pretty cool guy, he's 53 but there's no age barrier out here. Hiked up Blood Mountain today, which was the toughest uphill yet, but also had the best views.
We met up with Hare and Moses, and as we were getting ready to go down the mountain, Scurvy announced that there was a pizza party at Neels Gap at 3:30. So everyone immediately threw their packs on, excited to start hiking, but then everyone realized he was not serious.
Hare led the way down the mountain to a dead end. Very appropriately, Moses led us back out and down the mountain. We all went into Neel's Gap together, and I got a shakedown and dropped about 2 lbs from my pack. Got some more food, and Hi-Ho got me a coke and a slice of pizza, which I hoovered. Hiked out of Neel's, and found a great spot to camp up on a ridgeline. I wonder if these lights twinkling in the distance are Dahlonega. Camping with Hi-Ho, Moses, Scurvy, and Space Goat(who has a 95L pack). Great day.","Lance Creek
",Swaim Gap,"Mar 15, Tue",10.30
Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524922,"Wow, what a day! Last night, I had dreams about a vine man coming out of the edge of the woods and staring at my tent. Didn't die, woke up and hiked to Tesnatee Gap, where my cousin Scott and his friend Jeremy came out to hike.First they gave me a beer, which was amazing, then a ton of candy. They drove up to Hogpen Gap and I pushed to hike the mile from Tesnatee to Hogpen to meet them. Only took about 30 minutes.I freshened up with some Axe body spray. We all pushed hard and ended up having a good time and blowing past our planned camping spot. This was my biggest day yet by far. My cousin Scott (Candy Cowboy) was offering candy to every hiker he passed. It was nice to get to know his friend Jeremy (Tennessee Honey), who was named so for his choice of liquor which he packed in. Had a great time at camp catching up with Scott and getting to know Jeremy, who was a paramedic with some wild stories. Scott has been wandering around camp taking photos, and made the observation that there are no animals out here at all. Very tough day, my knee was really hurting, but that's nothing that Tennessee Honey out of a dog bowl can't fix! Starting to get an appetite. Great day.","Swaim Gap
",Chattahoochee Gap,"Mar 16, Wed",13.60
Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524923,"What an awesome day. Only 5 miles down to Unicoi Gap, which is good because my right knee is screaming. Going to get a brace here in town. On my way down to Unicoi I ran into a woman named Driftwood, who was hiking with her autistic son, Wildwood. He is injured, but can't vocalize how, so they are taking a 0 at Blue Mountain Shelter. Unfortunately, her phone is dead and won't charge, so she let me charge my phone, and I let her use my phone to call her husband and contact Miss Janet. She is pretty amazing with what she is doing.In Unicoi Gap I met Lone Star, who was doing some trail magic with his church group from Savannah. It was a huge spread. I had a hot dog, hamburger, and a donut. I also met High Cotton, who took his hat off to reveal white hair. He is hiking with Tippy Toes, who is having major blister issues. I've been happy with my foot situation so far. Then my old high school buddy(from 18 years ago) Loren picked me up and brought me to a Mongolian Grill in Hiawassee. We had some good laughs and we remembered one of our old mottoes, ""Trying is failing."" We were talking about how we're the old men now.Loren was relaying a story to me about his older coworker talking to a younger coworker. Older guy said ""You haven't lived. You know how I know? You still have a zest for life."" Ha!Then Loren dropped me off at the Budget Inn, where I was lucky enough to run into Hi-Ho, Scurvy, Space Goat, Juan, and a few others. Glad it all worked out. Bought a smaller cookpot at the outfitter. Sharing a room with Space Goat. Now to sleep in a bed.","Chattahoochee Gap
",Unicoi Gap,"Mar 17, Thu",4.70
Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524980,"Today was a fight. Hi-Ho and I resupplied at Ingles, sent some stuff home, and packed up in the morning. A Slingblade impersonator took us to the trailhead in his shuttle with other hikers. Then it was straight up Rocky Mountain and back down. Then we went up Tray Mountain and back down. Then a series of PUDs (pointless ups and downs). Hi-Ho took the lead today and helped keep me moving. He's like a pack mule that won't quit. We kept leap-frogging Space Goat and Scurvy, and stopped at Tray Mountain shelter for lunch. When Hi-Ho opened his food bag, an enormous spider crawled out, and Scurvy had a conniption (he's arachnophobic). It should be noted that Hi-Ho packed his food bag in a hotel room.Beautiful views today, and this group is good. I hope we don't get too much rain as it continues to get colder in the coming week. My pack was 37 lbs after resupplying, and I'm exhausted.","Unicoi Gap
",Sassafras Gap,"Mar 18, Fri",12.40
Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524986,"Today was a tough but good day. The 4 of us climbed up Kelly Knob, which was some of the hardest climbing yet. My right knee with the brace did well on the downhill, but my left started hurting, as well as my left Achilles tendon. Maybe I'll strap those up too, and will eventually be wearing a full body wetsuit. Hi-Ho pointed out some birds to me today, as well as the sound of a grouse drumming, which sounds like a helicopter starting up. Saw some junkos, tufted tit-mice, woodpeckers, and a few others. Hi-Ho leads down hills now, and I lead up hills. We all hit some trail magic from a bunch of outdoor leaders, from Young Harris College. Got a hot dog, hamburger, coke, and Fritos. It lifted my spirits and really helped. If you want to see pure, unadulterated joy, feed a hungry thru-hiker. They can't fake that joy.We hiked roughly 10 miles today, set up camp at Plumorchard Shelter, a cool 3-level shelter nested in rhododendrons. We met Once A Day, who got that name because she falls once a day. We've got a good group here, but I know it won't last. I'll be taking a zero with Jamie soon (can't wait), Hi-Ho is skipping PA since he's already done it, and Scurvy is running out of money.  The views are beautiful, but it's the people that get you through the day. Had an avocado for lunch today and it was amazing. Soaked my feet in the cold creek, and dodged the rain so far. Every day, I learn new things in regards to how to hike or pack or store things. I'm slowly getting more efficient. Tips you pick up for cooking or cleaning or breaking down camp, I've learned so much already.Tomorrow we cross into my home state, baby! I've had a lot of time to think out here, and here are some things I already know I want to do after the trail. Learn some basic carpentry and woodworking from Mom. I think I'd really enjoy working with my hands. Go fishing with Dad, we always enjoyed that in the past. Read all the books that I own but haven't read yet.","Sassafras Gap

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526234,"Crossed into NC today! Hi Ho and I both wanted pics at the sign, but our phones kept shutting off. The cold saps the batteries. I'm sleeping with my phone and my water filter in my sleeping bag to keep them in working order. We passed two Austrlian Vietnam vets. Real nice guys, they said it was 100 degrees back home. 
Then it started snowing here. Then it changed to ice pellets. We hiked up all day long. My knees, left achilles, and feet are all getting beat to hell. Hi-Ho is always swearing about his phone. It's his first smartphone. I thoroughly enjoy his technohate. 
Space goat was in the military over in the middle east. Scurvy packed up and left a house in Flint, Michigan. You can't even shower in the water there, he says, such a shame. 
Too cold to write more. Hope it stops snowing! Good night!
(Note from wife who is typing this in from Justin's scrawled entries - It took me forever to realize it was ""Space Goat"" and not ""Spare Boot"", which sounds like a totally valid trail name)","Plumorchard shelter
",Standing Indian Shelter,"Mar 20, Sun",12.20
Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526238,"Good day, tough morning. It was probably the coldest, windiest night of my life. Ice pellets and snow and wind. Pulled one of my stakes out. I was zipped up with the liner over my face and my beanie, down jacket on. Hope the smokies aren't this cold. The hike up Standing Indian wasn't bad, because of the long switchbacks. We hiked through 1.5-2 inches of snow, and eventually it stopped and the sun melted it all away. Couldn't really take pictures, my phone would just shut off. Haven't seen Scurvy and Space Goat today, as Hi-Ho and I left early. 
We did about 7 to Carter Gap Shelter for lunch. There was a group of overnighters from Nebraska. Very nice, and they gave us each a shot of Tillamore Dew. Warmed up nicely on the inside. Non-thru-hikers seem to think all we eat is Ramen, ha! I have a running joke going now with Hi-Ho where I offer him anything I'm eating that has peanuts in it. He's allergic. We finally pushed through Betty Creek Gap and up to Mooney. There are a lot of ""No Camping"" signs out here, as the NFS is trying to renaturalize some sites. But it's making planning tougher. Got a nice fire going now and turning in soon. Going to be cold but not like last night! 
P.S. Hi-Ho shared what he wished he had known before he became a father and he said that kids are made out of rubber and concrete. Don't overreact, they'll be okay.","Standing Indian Shelter
",Mooney Gap,"Mar 21, Mon",12.30
Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526239,"Today, Hi-Ho and I exceeded my expectations. We did near 12 miles before 2:30. Machines! We scrambled up the technical climb of Albert Mountain and took photos from the fire tower. Didn't hardly see a soul today. Got to winding stair gap and shuttled in to Franklin. Shorty drove us in, she loves meeting hikers. 
In town, we went to Outdoor 76, where they determined my knee pain is derived from misalignment. So they got me some new shoes (Hokas) with custom fitted insoles. You know it's serious when you're in a show store and they cut an oven on (for making the soles pliable to be shaped to my exact foot shape). In theory, this will help my foot, achilles, and knee pain. They seem very knowledgeable. I'll take my old shoes for a few days just in case. The Lone Peaks are extremely minimal and don't offer enough support for a foot like mine.
After spending some time at Outdoor 76, we ate like pigs at Sakura. Hi-Ho bought my dinner and drinks. Good guy. Hope we can hang together for a long time. We heard Space Goat and Scurvy got off the trail. Sad, but we ran into Moses today at the Budget Inn. Cozy.","Mooney Gap

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526265,"What a day. Started it with a great country breakfast at the Normandie and then resupplied at Ingles. Last night we had Japanese Hibachi at Sakura. We had edamame, gyoza, several beers, a sushi roll, both had hibachi chicken and a salad, then ice cream. 
Inspired by Gator Miller, I""ve been doing one or more acts of trail maintenance whether it's kicking a rock off the trail, or moving a branch, etc. If every hiker did that, the trail would be a better place. 
We shuttled back to winding stair gap with Ron Haven. He was a character. Really nice and talked the whole way about Cherokee words and history of the tribe in the area. The Cherokee would never say ""goodbye."" They say ""see you later."" They only say goodbye when they are dying. 
Hi-Ho and I hiked all afternoon and got to Wayah Bald Fire tower. Nice stonework. There was a nice couple from Asheville there giving out trail magic. Bananas, tangerines, chili, corona and bread. My knees are already better with the new shoes I got. My feet hurt but I know I need to break in the soles. Hopefully this works out! Tonight we are camping with a big family and a section hiker named Hatchet. Shes' been doing 25 mile days. Also met Footlong, Nesquik, and a few others.","Franklin, NC

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526271,"This morning the group we camped with gave us survival bracelets with beads they wove in to remind us that they are pulling for us. Very thoughtful. Hi-Ho and I exploded today. We got some trail magic from I Believe at Tellico Gap (crackers and a coke). Hit Wesser Bald Fire tower, & briefly stopped at Wesser Bald Shelter. We met Dawn & a German guy named Spike, but decided to press on. 
Eventually it started to rain. The last shelter before NOC was only 1 mile away, so we pressed on and got a cabin. 17 miles today. My feet are kiling me and Hi-Ho really hurt his lower shin. But he's headed back to PA for a few days, and I get 2 zeroes with my lovely wife who I miss so much. Apparently in the Smokies there's bad norovirus, mandatory shelters, bears, and cold weather. Not great.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526274,"Two zeroes with Jamie was incredible, but in a way this felt like day 1 again. My body could feel the two days off, and saying goodbye to Jamie was really tough. She hiked two miles (up) from NOC with me before she went back. She's the best.
I saw Jai and Irie, met a lady named Maria who I couldn't keep up with, and trekked up, all day, until I got to cheoah bald. It was too misty and drizzly to see much, but I knew it was down from there. That was a very very tough hike up. The down was easier.
When I finally got to Locust cove gap, there were only 4 other people here, but now it's a tent city. Some really nice folks here, so after my dinner I built a fire. That seems to be a good way to get people together. I met Adam, Angie, ran into Maya again who is now Twinkletoes, Joker from the Netherlands, Caboose once again (thanks for the beer in Hiawassee!), Voodoo, AJ and Matt. All really cool folks and the evening ended up being quite nice around the campfire. Now I'm in my tent and hearing sprinkles, hope it doesn't get too bad tonight. Not really looking forward to the smokies and norovirus and the cold, but it's coming up quick.
PS - The irony of getting this great new pad is that whoever is tented next to me has my old noisy pad.","NOC (sleep Inn)

Sunshine is life! Sunshine is warmth. Fired up my mp3 player for the first time on my hike. I think it boosts my RPMs! Got to Cable Gap Shelter at 12. Too early to stop but I spread my tent out to dry. Hiked out with Twinkletoes, Firecracker, and Simba. Hiked for several hours and then ended up hitting Hwy 28. I needed to get my resupply at Fontana Lodge, so I called in & waited while the others went on. I caught the last shuttle to town and I wasn't going to hike anymore, so I got my resupply and a room.

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526735,"Entered the Smokies today! Hiked with Moses across Fontana Dam today and up to Shuckstack tower. Beautiful views, but the very top was pretty sketchy. Ended up hiking with Conductor (named such because of how he swings a stick to get spiderwebs) and Nesquik, cool dudes. Eventually got to the shelter and let it fill up so I could tent. Tenting in the smokies is not allowed unless shelters are full. Had a good time at the campfire with Bruce, Nesquik, Stitch, Lil cub (transcriber's note: not sure on that trail name), Sir Fob w Pots (father of boy who poops on trail), BookandBoot (from Australia). Sir Fob is hilarious, he said he was going to interview a horse in the Virginia Highlands. Today was warm, I could see heat radiation coming off the trail. Smokies could get snow though. 
Today I was thinking about the importance of the outdoors. I think at some point I'd like to volunteer, or manage, or own a summer camp. When I was younger, I was really nervous about going, but once I did it was transformative. Summer Camp can be a magical, rit of passage type of place where kids learn the value of nature and the environment. Not to mention have fun. 
I think of a lot of random stuff out here. It's really satisfying out here, but it is work. It's not fun per se, but I do feel myself getting strong and more self-sufficient.","Fontana Lodge

I can't pinpoint exactly what it is about the Smokies, but it's a real buttkicker. Every day I go through amazing ups and monotonous lows where I question what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm looking for. All of my former reasons for wanting to hike seem dimmed and all I can think about is that my time with my wife is precious and how much I miss her. But I have to stay focused and push through the (intense) foot pain. I am not throwing away my shot. 
Wildlife update. I saw a big doe today! And a grouse rocketed past me the other day, scaring the crap out of me. Saw some smoke today from a fire, but I don't know if it was natural or prescribed. I know it's the Smokies but that's a little too literal. Today, Rocky Top & Thunderhead had beautiful views, but it was difficult terrain. I know my custom soles are reshaping the way my feet work, but it hurts a lot. And I hope it equalizes soon. This is probably super boring to read! Sorry!
Same group tonight as last night, so that's cool. Book and Boot is really nice, and writing a dissertation on Cormac McCarthy's book Suttree. I really enjoyed his books Blood Meridian and The Road. I'll have to read it! Man, it's windy up here, I'm tenting again tonight but rain is coming. Hope I don't regret not staying in the shelter.","Mollie's Ridge Shelter

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527351,"I walked up hills and then down them today. And it was hard. How do you like my journal NOW?! I jest. Didn't sleep great last night, the wind was relentless. Every gust I winced and hoped my stakes would hold. All day the blustery wind blew from the east (right), with impending rain coming, I only did about 5 miles to the shelter (Silas Bald). My dad was harassed by a bear here long ago. I took a short break with Fob, Nesquik, Stitch, and conductor. 
I decided to press on the 1.7 miles to the next shelter, with skies darkening. I pushed hard and even ran a little in flat spots. Fast miles. Made it to Double Springs Gap, here amongst the beautiful high altitude pines. Then the rain came.
It's hard to stop at 1pm for the day without a book to read, but I""ll just relax. I'm getting a book next chance I get. we have 1 full shelter here tonight. Mostly the same folks I've camped with the past 2 nights. Good group.

Hope he comes back but I won't see him again. Got up this morning after a great night of sleep in the shelter. Started hiking this morning in the drizzle and mist. The trail was a creek all day, but my feet never got that wet. Great shoes, great sock system! Great Scott!
Despite the dreary conditions, I decided it was going to be a great day. And it was. The Smokies are gorgeous. This ancient, mossy forest is enchanting. It's quite unique. So I lost a croc today. Busted carabiner. So it must have swung off. Doh! I thought maybe it was Fob or Nesquik April Foolin' me. But nope! I hiked with Orbit and her mom awhile today. Really nice folks, I think it's great that a mother-daughter unit is doing this together. That'll be something they can always share.
Got to Clingman's dome today in the mist. Hiked .5 down the mountain to the general store and bought a Smoky Mountains National Park patch. The park rangers there had a little trail magic for thru-hikers. Cookies and a bag of chips! Totally worth the hike down. But the hike back up on pavement was tough. I was passing people without packs though and drawing funny looks. I""m a thru-hiker, get used to it! 
Then hiked the last half with Nesquik. Good dude, fellow Walking Dead fan. I shared my Jack Daniels chocolate with him and he seemed to appreciate it. Dropping off trash at Newfound Gap was a relief. It's the little things. Also, this was the first time I felt like a rockstar. Lots of people at Newfound Gap were asking about our hike and impressed. Pretty cool, pretty cool. Pretty neat, pretty neat. 
Orbit was talking about how her mom has her great grandma's engagement ring, and she has her grandma's engagement ring, so they had some double grandma action. I told her that was super cool, but never to use that phrase again. Ha!
At the shelter, Fob did a weird tongue trick, he's missing the line of skin below the tongue. He said when he was circumsized, he was backwards. Ha!
Met a guy named Tortoise today who is pretty inspiring. He has Fabraise (spelling?), and has to get transfusions every 2 weeks, but he's doing sections to show others to not let it ruin their lives. Very cool.

Yesterday I passed a fence & sign about a beech tree protection area. Apparently wild hogs eat up everything. *wife's note: left out a story about Elvis the pig to protect the innocent
The smokies have been pretty tough. When hiking with Nesquik I created a new mantra. ""At least it's not stairs."" The smokies are filled with these log steps, and they are terrible. Sleeping in the shelter tonight. Supposed to be 20 degrees?! Got Master Bruce, Nesquik, Stitch, Orbit & mom, and Fob in here. Awesome group! Now my eyes are on Hot Springs, NC.

The trail that was a creek yesterday? Now it's ice. I spent my morning hopping from sunspot to sunspot trying to get my core temperature up. Coldest night of my life (for real this time!). Felt strong though, and made good time. Overheard someone say ""what's worse? The pain of hard work or the pain of regret?""So, of our group, I think I was the only one who went the extra .6 miles up to MT Cammerer Lookout. It was stunningly beautiful up there. I met several nice couples who were interested in my hike, and a former thru-hiker (class of 2014) named Caboose. She was extremely cool and gave me some trail magic in the form of cookies, crackers, and kind bars. It was her 2 year anniversary of her hike. So inspiring to meet people who have done it and know how to empathize and give good information. Thanks Caboose! I hope you're doing what you love now. So after that, I felt amazing and made good time. I blew past the original 15 mile goal of Davenport Shelter, leaving only this message in the shelter register ""Can't stop now, can't stop here, 3 more miles to pizza & beer!""I caught up to Nesquik and we hiked together to Standing Bear Hostel.It's pretty old school collection of wooden privy, bunkhouse, kitchen building, and laundry with an actual washboard. What it lacks in luxury, it makes up for in rural charm. 3 dogs, 3 cats, and a chicken...climbing a tree? Yep. Man I've seen it all. Food and resupply items are on an honor system, write it down and tally it. Bought a ginger ale, gatorade, banana, fudge round, and pizza just for tonight. Got enough stuff to reach Hot Springs.Met some more cool folks tonight. Little Bear & Lindsay, who are shooting a documentary about women on the AT. Tree hugger, Glider, (who gave me a whistle he woodworked), Section 8(who gave me a beer), Alpaca, Burt and a few others. In the bunkhouse we got Rocky, Nesquik, Fob, Orbit & mom, stitch, and a few others. Rocky was only planning to go to the aforementioned shelter, but when he saw my message he pushed on. When he showed up here he yelled ""Deadwood you son of a bitch!"" Ha! Good guy. This bunkhouse feels a little like summer camp. I put some of my things on a moose antler.

Those folks are awesome. They put in a lot of hard work so we can enjoy the trail. Thanks to all AT club volunteers!
Hit some awesome trail magic at Brown Gap from ""hiker family."" They (all 7 of them) thru-hiked last year. They had been doing trail magic about 4 days and said they saw around 100 hikers a day. Wow. Really nice folks. I got chili chips, a coke, cookies, and lemonade. That helped boost me up to Max Patch, which is a beautiful grassy bald with great panoramic views. Nice hiking today, but the feet hurt a lot. After big mile days the day before, they usually do hurt. 
Met Cheena, Conundrum, Jared, Poptart, Pedro Dynamite and a few others. At the shelter, I met Southbound, who thru-hiked in 2013, he gave me a beer, some whiskey, carrots, chips, and hummus that he packed in. The beer was an (can't decipher it) IPA from Asheville.

It's hard to push yourself out of comfort. But I did after breakfast at the diner. The Trail goes through town, so I hiked through and over the French Broad River. Oh and Nesquick came into town this morning. Good to see that guy. Today I leapfrogged with Ceena, Buckeyes, McLovin and Stone. A nice, cloudy day of hiking. Crossed some former tobacco fields that the NFS maintains for turkey and grouse mating areas. Also hiked through some areas that have been burned in recent prescribed fires. I could still smell it. It's always tough to hike uphill with a full foodbag. Slow day but a good day. I was thinking about this hike. I'm literally becoming an endurance athlete. Every day walking over 10 miles with approximately 30 pounds of weight, is to endure. Enduring pain, discomfort, cold, heat, hunger, while managing resources like food, water, etc. Learning to deal with this constant negativity takes away its harm.

Going to get a new pad in Erwin. Also last night there was a mouse gnawing on a log of the shelter. After what was probably 2 or 3 hours, it finally stopped and something sounded like it fell free. Then there was a chorus of victorious mouse squeaks. I can't even make this stuff up. 
Today it snowed off and on all day. Tomorrow it will be even colder. There's a hostel 10 miles out, so if it keeps snowing I may do that.

Just Tyler, Stitch, and I grouped up today and hiked together for morale. And it made a huge difference. It's a great way to get to knwo someone while you are distracted from the pain. We had a great time as the sun came out and matched our moods. At one point we were talking about birthdays, and how, to Tyler and myself, they have lost significance. But Stitch said, ""not for me, I want a song. I want a cake!"" This ties into the story later.So we all make it into Spivey Gap and decide to have our lunch there. We all finish up and are about to head up the trail on a big uphill. Then a white van with a Casper the friendly ghost decal comes down the road and pulls in. His van says ""AT friendly van!"" An older gentleman gets out and waves us down. We knew it was trail magic. We got cold sodas and chocolate. His name is Rob Bird and he used to run a hostel in Massachusetts called The Birdcage. All of its services were free. He never charged a dime. He then told us that he has an apartment down near Erwin and that he still takes in a few hikers from time to time. He just has to ""look them in the eyes and see them smile a bit first."" Funny, because we were scoping out the van situation with similar discerning eyes. He tells us to call him from the No Business Shelter, which is about halfway to our entry point to Erwin. So we all hike up very eagerly, pass Pop Tart, Gunga Dan, Spongebob and Orange Pacer. At the No Business Shelter (it did not have a privy, as the name may imply), we call him. Then we meet our first southbounder, Rockman. What an inspiration. He is finishing his hike from last year. He has broken a leg, a foot, and dealt with a parasite from swimming in a pond. He was still determined. Go get 'em Rockman!So anyway we roll into River Rd, our Erwin entry point. I hop into Uncle Johnny's for a new pad, a stamp, and gatorades for Tyler and Stitch. I met Johnny - cool guy. When I go back out I notice the line I hung my crocs off of is limp. No crocs. Ha! Now I've lost 3. Great job, me! But it's okay, we cross the Nolichucky river by way of bridge and get into a stranger's van that doesn't have real seats in the back, but a folding metal chair and a camp chair. And it was the best move any hiker made on this day, in all of the US. Rob took us back to his apartment, which is half native-American decor, half hiker memorabilia and pictures. He has albums of everyone who stayed with him all the way back to 2002. These are going to go to the AT Museum in Pine Grove, and now I'll be in them. He gave me crocs (I'll lose 'em but thanks), let us do laundry, take showers, gave me qtips and gave me a little moonshine, let us charge devices, took us to an amazing Chinese buffet (I had 3 plates and ice cream), took us to resupply and is letting us stay for as long as we like. It's his birthday, so Stitch bought him (and the rest of us) dinner. He already had a blizzard cake in his freezer, but when we got back we sang Happy Birthday to him. All night he was getting calls and texts from former thru hikers who just adore Rob and his unparalleled kindness. Some people just are this good for the sake of being good. Here are some good Rob quotes: ""Don't say clean. Say washed."" ""Brevity is the soul of wit."" And here is what it says above his doorframe: ""Don't be sad that it's over, smile because it happened."" Beautiful. I am overwhelmed by his kindness and his story, and I am glad to have met him. Such lucky timing in our journey, and such a boost to my spirit and faith in humanity. We will never have trail magic this incredible again. Rob, you are the definition of trail angel. Thank you.

They were hiking southbound and slackpacking. It was great to see them. Slackpacking is when you only take a daypack with water and snacks, and hike to a destination where your actual pack is. It makes for faster, easier miles. I had the same opportunity as well, but it didn't feel right to what my purpose is out here. I don't judge others at all, and I'm still not certain, but I think I may forgo slackpacking. I think I'll feel more accomplished if I take my pack the whole way. I dunno. So, I think the novelty of hiking the AT is gone. The routines are established. It's just waht I do now. Day in and day out. And I think I've said it before, but 99% of the time, it's not fun. It's something else. It's character-building, it's fulfilling, but rarely is it fun. Fun is easy. This is not. But that's okay, I think. I may do some audiobooks while I hike. At least until plants start blooming and animals start moving. Today I saw what looked like a trashbag on the trail. I thought ""trail magic!"" But to my disappointment and slight horror, it was a dead turkey someone had carved the breast out of and disposed of...right on the trail.

I could see Orange Pacer far up ahead, a speck in the distant rising sentinel. Going up that mountain, with wind so strong I had to walk at an angle, birds flying sideways, I seriously felt like I was hiking Everest. The gusts were unrelenting, but the panoramic 360 views - absolutely stunning. I had to earn that view. Often it's at these times, when things are hardest, that memories are forged. A vista I'll never forget. These epic days help me when I have tough days. I have to remember that I'm not at the top of the mountain yet, and I can't see all of the intangible things that I'll see so clearly at the end of this trek. The rewards are sometimes invisible until you reach the summit. 
I hiked down with Orange Pacer today on account of me picking up his sweater that had blown off. Finally I returned the favor Stitch and Pop Tart did for me! Cool guy.

Signs said Watauga Shelter was closed and not to stop in that 4 mile stretch. Don't have to tell me twice! Also, everything on the right side of the trail was burned. I ran into a volunteer, who I noticed had a Kincora hat. It's a famous hostel run by trail legend Bob Peeples. I asked if he was Bob, and he was! Very nice gentleman. He explained to me that the fire was a couple nights ago, and that the forest service and Hot Shots used the trail as a natural break and backfired down toward the shore of the lake. That kept the fire from spreading. I saw a few areas still on fire, and smoke billowing up from random spots. Well, this was maybe my biggest day hours-wise. 8:30am to 7pm of hiking. Here at Vandeventer are: Conundrum & Cheena, who have been married 3 years, Super nice couple. Also, Ricky and Joe from 2 nights ago, section hiking to Damascus. Once the sun went down, I got out on some rocks with Ricky and enjoyed the view of towns and their lights twinkling on the lake shimmering in nearly full moonlight. He told me all about his passion for lake diving, something I would never, ever do but fascinating nonetheless.","Black Bear Resort

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533310,"It was a nice hike today. A pretty good old walk in the woods. Today I briefly ran into Ten-Hut, a nice gentleman I first met at Mountain Harbour. We talked for a bit, I took the lead and didn't see him again. Passed the Nick Grindstaff memorial/grave today, no clue who this was, but the headstone said ""Lived alone. Suffered alone. Died alone."" Geez that's heavy, ha! Sorry Nick! Sounds like he got a bad hand dealt to him. So the past two days I feel like I've been in a weird anti-bubble of hikers. I just haven't seen that many. And mostly section hikers going the other way. No one has passed or caught up to me in awhile. Very odd. When I resupplied at Black Bear, I underestimated how many snacks I eat. Dinners are fine, but I almost ran out of supplementary food for between meals. I eat a lot, folks. Like a lot, a lot. Luckily, there was an orange metal box on the trail today, and in it was trail magic. A cold soda, a can of Beanie Weenies, and a cheese danish. This really sort of saved me. Thank you, Nelson Baptist Church in Mountain City, TN! These great folks restock this chest daily, which is why it wasn't empty like most coolers I've encountered. Today I went through an open meadow of hilly farmland. Beautifully green with yellow dandelions. It looked like the Windows 98 background, ha! Just beautiful. Passed an odd and angry couple today. I asked how the day in the forest was, and he said something like ""trying to be good."" Something seemed like they were fighting. He had a duffle bag on his back and was talking about getting all the bags out there. I didn't understand but kept moving. Later I saw a woman's bag hanging on a stick with what looked like a blow dryer handle sticking out. Then I passed a single candle in the trail. Whattt?? I pushed past my original destination and put a few more miles between myself and that stuff. Here at camp. Highway and Brightbags both saw the weird couple. Brightbags said if the candle was lit, he would have ran, ha! Tomorrow I hit Virginia, and then Damascus, where Jamie will join me on Thursday. Wahoo, baby!","Vandeventer Shelter

But I will say, 2 new things are happening. Bugs. And heat. It seems like mosquitoes and gnats and blackflies are out. So is the 80 degree weather and direct sunlight. Thusly upping my water intake by roughly double. Adapt and overcome! Passed into Virginia today, which was a pretty huge boost. I know I'll be in Virginia for another 500 miles, a quarter of the trail, but I'm ready for the rolling farmland. Very excited! Almost to 500 miles. I actually feel like my steps are beginning to raise money for Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation. It's going well! I actually feel like I can do this!Descending into Damascus today I could smell the sweet fragrance of flowers, even with a cold. Look! Blooming things! Color! Life! Beauty! Ahh! I hiked into town and to I Hikers (??) but it was full, so I referenced my book for the other hostel with laundry and I called. The woodchuck. I ended up getting the upstairs (6 empty beds) to myself. But I had to backtrack through town again. Eh, I've done over 450 miles, what's another .5? Ran into Bright Bags again, real cool dude and I also met Criss-Cross and Sunray. They are an extraordinarily nice Swiss couple. Sunray doesn't speak english very well yet, so Criss-Cross sort of translates for her. Her drawings are the really extravagant, happy ones I've seen in shelter logs. Bright Bags gave me a pear (?) and the swiss couple gave us all apple pie that they made. Lovely! I also met Feral and Human. Apparently there is literally only one restaurant open in town tonight after 5pm. Soo..I went there! Hey Joe's served tacos and burritos and beer. Pretty much all I could ask for. After 3 catfish tacos, one chicken taco, chips and salsa and 2 beers, I didn't ask for more. I ran into Savage there, who had been there since 1pm. She had planned on hiking but the towns can be like whirlpools. They pull you back. I also met Owl, a nice guy. I paid some of the charity I have received out here forward by buying them beers. Highway was there, and I met Brawnee, the spaniard, secret agent, and a few others I just can't recall. Walked with Savage back to my hostel (hers was past it) and I think she appreciated it. She had some weird encounters in town earlier. I found out she did a 33 mile day, whaaat? People are great. Teh trail is great. I'm very thankful for this opportunity.

She brought me a big box of food and snacks, and an early birthday present, a new phone! It has a better camera and battery life. I got podcasts and audiobooks set up, and I'm ready to roll again. I snacked all day, ate ice cream, and napped in a soft bed. We went to a nice restaurant called Rain for dinner. It was a really nice restaurant in downtown Abingdon.

The trail follows the Virginia Creeper trail for awhile, and after we walked almost half a mile, she extended her trekking poles and they fell apart. I tried to fix them, but I'm no German pole engineer. Jamie took it upon herself to jog back to the car and get my old poles (I had purchased new ones in Damascus). Oh what timing! Thanks Jamie for that jog! That was me returning the room key a few weeks ago with my buddy Erik. We hiked a fair bit of uphill through the drizzle, and at one point Jamie was inspecting some lichen. She turned it over and an inch from her hand was an enormous spider. ""Who dares disturb my slumberrr?"" it asked through gritted fangs. ""We do not"" as we ran away.We took a lunch break and socket caught up to us. He is always reading local information about towns and areas and was telling us about a group of people who, all until recently, had blue skin and lived in the Appalachians. He was saying that they were interbred and it was passed through genetics. Jamie exclaimed ""the blue genes!"" Ha!We had to take a short detour because a bridge had been washed out. It brought us around to the very bicycle-crowded Virginia creeper trail once again. We then climbed a bit more, took several breaks, and eventually made it to this interesting pond campsite. Henceforth dubbed Peeper Pond because of the peeper frogs that wouldn't shut up. There were enormous tadpoles the size of fish in there. A thru-hiker named Ryan stopped by for a break, and ate a block of cheese. He had many many more blocks of cheese in his pack. Now it's a little chilly so it's time to snuggle up in this tiny tent. Update: Jamie's pad has a leak in it, just like Erik's did. These ex-peds are really not durable in the least. But, we found the leak. Good eye, Jamie. We used the patch kit, and now fingers are crossed. Also, the peepers are really noisy and active at this pond. Decibel frogs, great band name.Update: Patch kit did not hold.","Comfort Inn Abingdon

Her camera sensor died, so only black screen. Her trekking poles fell apart. Her sleeping pad had a hole in it, which we patched but it still leaked. (I let her sleep on mine) She had Deet leak and start eating through the dry sack. I think there were other things too, but that's the bulk of it. Poor wife! But she did great. The shuttle came today a little past 12, picked her up and took her back to her life away from me. *Long breath* I will savor and hold on to how I feel with her for as long as I can. Can't wait to see her in another month. 
So today I hiked with Socket. He's a really interesting, thrifty guy with a lot of unique knowledge. Fun to be around. Today we hiked up Whitetop MOuntain followed by Mt. Rogers. We're in the Virginia Highlands and tomorrow we break 500 miles! We saw some ponies grazing in a bald. Very beautiful. Also passed some maple trees that were being tapped. Pretty cool. I could chug a gallon of syrup now. Ha! Long day today, but very cool. Oh, right after the shuttle picked up Jamie, I was about to walk into the woods when a van honked and pulled up. A lady got out and gave me an apple, 2 tangerines, and crackers. I have incredible luck! I shared the trail magic with Socket. Pay it forward any time you can. Gorgeous campsite today.

Still shaking this cold. Took off strong this morning after that, and the skies where blue and weather was perfect. Hiked until I saw some ponies, took some photos a selfie with one of them and moved on. Absolutely incredible landscape and views. I went through a tight rock tunnel called fatman's squeeze, which was probably a taste of Maine. Can't wait. Entered Grayson Highlands and stepped over a log which was supposed to block an old trail. I probably went half a mile before the trail died and I realized I hadn't seen a white blaze in a good while. Doubled back and came upon Wise Shelter. Met up with Socket again. And saw Ptarmagen (??), Orion, and Tetris. 
Hiked to ""the scales"" which occasionally acts as a livestock corral, and got a free beer from a guy named Willie. He called himself a trail devil. Socket also found a bag of trail mix and 2 Alpine Aire meals. We split that and I shared my mix with Ptarmagen, Tetris, and Orion.

Flapping tent meant I was ready to go when the sun came up. I headed out very early. I passed old Orchard trail, which I remembered from my Jamie hike 8ish years ago. I pushed hard today, took a few breaks, and stayed focused. I passed Trimpi Shelter and got water there.

The trail itself wasn't incredibly overwhelming, but not every section can be. I was listening to a TED talk and heard something that resonated with me. There is an ancient philosophy called Basic Trust. It says, more or less, that whatever happens is exactly what needs to happen to make you the person you need to become. That you can grow, learn, and become stronger through hardship. You can grow through adversity. 2000 years ago, stoic philosopher Epictetus said, and I paraphrase, ""People are not disturbed by things, but by the view they take of them.""Today I saw 2 does cross the trail.

My core stayed dry due to my rain jacket, but everything else got soaked. It was a long 8ish miles uphill in the rain, slowly getting colder and colder. I did see a huge group (pod? gaggle?) of deer, trees that were foaming in the rain, and an enormous stinky landfill, so the day wasn't a total bust. Ha! By the time I reached the shelter, I have never been happier to reach it. I could barely move my fingers and knew I needed to warm up.I stripped, got into dry clothes, inflated my pad and got in my bag. Took about an hour to get moderately warm. This is the first time I was actually a little worried about myself. So cold and rainy...in May. Wish I hadn't sent home my beanie already.

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543299,"Duuude. Last night a guy showed up at the shelter around 9 or so, past dark, and woke us all up. We had some space for him in the shelter, but he was thoroughly saturated and worst of all, his sleeping bag was too. We offered help but there wasn't much we could do. He bailed water, put it into a thick-walled water bottle and put it in his bag. He did this several times over the course of the night. Zam was his name. He died. Just kidding. Also, Behindme is a super early riser. He left around 5:30 but got lost in the fog and started calling out ""shelter! hey shelter! help!"" I had earplugs in and missed this but Orion signaled him with his headlamp. Once he got his bearings he set off again.Hiking today was cold and uneventful. I think my personal hell might e endless putting on soaking wet socks. They warmed up pretty quickly at least, once I started hiking. Started listening to ""Watership Down,"" a classic I never read in school. When I arrived at the Pine Swamp Branch Shelter, I ran into Orion, Andy the Englishman and Elle (from my Smokies family!). She had been chasing my shelter entries for awhile now. It was cool seeing her again, but she's taking 2 zeroes, so she'll have to chase me once again! Orion and I reached a swollen stream that we couldn't cross without getting feet wet, so we switched to camp shoes and forded it. After a bit long, we followed signs to the Captain's and came to a stream and a wooden plank attached to a pulley system. I clipped in my pack and sat down, and tentatively started pulling myself across. Had to keep the legs outstretched to keep from the high water level. Finally across, I doscumented Orion's lack of caring for getting his legs wet. Had a good laugh.Captain's isn't a hostel, it's just a hiker-friendly guy's yard where you can tent, and his back porch, where I set up in case of rain. He's got a fridge absolutely packed with cold, free, sodas, a charging station, and trash bins. There's also a sauna, but I'm not fiddling with that, ha! Tonight I'll fall asleep dry, listening to the roar of the stream. Cheers!","Rice Field Shelter

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543301,"After struggling back across the ""zipline"" this morning, I set back out onto the muddy, rocky trail. The majority of the day was spent carefully stepping on and around rocks. Trekking poles have saved me counteless times. I haven't fallen yet and I fear my debt owed to the trial is accumulating and will cash in with me all at once. A broken ankle or leg I do not want.
Today I stopped at Wind Rock for the view and met 2 college kids from Virginia Tech and a Section hiker named Pete. Pete hails from Salisbury, NC, or Smallsbury as he called it. Nice guy, was doing an overnight and had wine and steaks for himself, ha! He gave me a few brownies and a Cadbury egg, so I forgave him for the steaks.
The rain was intermittent today, alternating between sun, rain, and my first hail on the trail. Very odd and hard to keep putting my rain jacket on and off. 
Silently passed a camoflauged hunter the other day with a shotgun. Maybe I instinctively zig zagged a little as I walked away.
Got to war spur shelter fairly early today, but my feet have been tender since they've mostly been wet. Met and talked to a very cool, very nice German named Marcus. He's headed to Trail Days in Damascus, but I informed him that he didn't get on the trail where he thought, and that he'd have to hike 200 miles southbound in 9 days to make it, ha! But there are shuttles everywhere.

Saw another big black snake edging the trail, and a small brownish striped snake coiled up in some leaves.Passed another burned area from the ""Captain fire"" and another random chimney on the trail.I finished Watership Down, and can't help but to make comparisons to The Walking Dead.

Ahh, the Appalachian Trail. So today was a long, tough day, but also had some interesting experiences. Saw the Audie Murphy WWII Memorial and hiked up to the stony Dragon's Tooth. Met a couple thruhikers there and 2 folks from Oregon representing Hyperlight Gear, working their way down to Trail Days. An adult beverage was passed around and it was a nice rest.Unfortunately, in classic Deadwood style, I left my hat up there. Once I got down about half a mile of precarious rock scrambling, I realized it, took off my pack and headed back up. But then Portuguese had grabbed it for me! Woohoo!Dragon's Tooth was the toughest and most technical stuff yet. A taste of New Hampshire. Passed mile 700 today on my way in to four pines Hostel, which is a huge 3 bay garage set against a farm of chickens, guinea fowl, a pond with bullfrogs, dogs, and other random animals. The garage is filled with sofas, recliners, a few beds and tables. A great place for hikers to unwind. I ordered a pizza from the local grocer basically as soon as I walked in, Pack still on. Ate the entire thing when it showed up, then Canuck and Moonboots gave me a beer and I was quite happy. Joe, the owner, and some of his friends were outside playing cornhole. The garage was full so I headed up to the barn, which was a 2 and a half foot shelf around the inside edge to sleep on. Andy the Englishman, Portuguese, and Northstars were here. Even had power sockets. Portuguese is a character. He calls me little boy because I look young. He was joking around tonight and said ""62 days and no make sex.

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544234,"Today, I walked a marathon. A little over 26 miles counting road walking and blue-blazing for water. And what a marathon it was. Started by climbing up the mountain and taking lunch at Johns Spring Shelter with Canuck, Moonboots, and Northstars. We were reminiscing about 1 night in a barn with Portuguese is better than 1 night in a 5 star hotel. Then pushed up to McAfee Knob and luckily the fog lifted just in time to take some good shots. Most photographed spot on the AT. Northstars saw a rattlesnake but I didn't bother. After that, I took my 2nd major wrong turn on my hike, followed powerlines down a hill and realized I had reconnected to the AT South of McAfee Knob. Whoops. Retraced my steps back up and waved goodbye to 30 minutes of daylight. Which I would later need. Discovering the place where I needed to turn, I continued on the AT. After a long day of mostly quiet hiking, I was heading up the mountain before my destination shelter, and a thunderstorm rolled in. As I hiked higher, the storm got angrier. It started pouring and next thing I knew, lightning was flashing and there was no delay with the earsplitting thunder. It was directly overhead. I would instinctively duck each time. I don't care who you are, your age, weight, height, or temperament, that is a sphincter-tightening experience. You realize your mortality and know you are totally helpless and vulnerable against the forces of an agitated mother nature. Why so serious, Naich?I slogged into Lambert's Meadow Shelter, with soaked feet, excited to relax. But that would be too simple, wouldn't it? Canuck, Moonboots, and a section hiker informed me of the situation. The shelter had been harassed by a family of bears the last 3 nights. To the point of coming into the shelter to take packs and foodbags, etc. I spotted a ripped up sleeping pad and scraps of paper and fabric. They were all staying and wanted power in numbers. It was almost 5:30, very late to start another 9 mile section. But nnnnnnnnnnnnnnope! I wasn't going to lose gear to bears. To town I went. To Daleville. So I started hiking with speed, efficiency, and purpose. I had changed into dry socks at Lambert's, but my shoes were still wet so they slowly became saturated also. But I didn't care. I moved with purpose, because every foot I made it in the day was a foot less I had to go in the dark. I got my headlamp out as the sun slipped behind dark mountains. There was fog up high on the ridgeline. So my beam diffused before reaching out too far. It was rocky terrain so I moved slowly. I could see lights from town below, but wayyyy below. It felt like I was in the woods, alone, far from anyone, headlamp guiding my way. It was my first time night hiking alone in unknown territory and it's very intense and primeval. You feel alive. I passed under a powerline easement and glanced to my left. About 50 yards out I saw 2 yellow eyes looking back at me. I turned the volume up on my podcasts and started clacking my poles together every 15 seconds. I'd check behind me every 30. After awhile, I passed another easement/field and up the hill probably 100 yards I saw 5 or 6 pairs of blue eyes reflecting. I swallowed panic and told myself “deer.” I fixed my bear spray to my chest and carried on. In a similar way to being in a rainstorm, it gets your adrenaline up and you forget about everything other than survival. And there's no way to pause it or get away faster. The way out is to see it through. You feel alive in these moments, but very, very stressed, ha! After what was likely an hour and a half in the dark, I heard the road nearby and made it out. I sighed loudly. Suddenly very tired, I knew a bed would do just the trick. Awesome day.","Four Pines Hostel

As are my shoes. My feet are also too big for my shoes now. My toes are rubbing on the sides. Jamie has ordered some new ones. 600 miles isn't too bad for trailrunners I suppose. Anyway I resupplied way too much food (they say you pack your fears, so I guess I don't want to starve), and walked back to the motel. The rest of the day, I showered, ate a pint of southern butter pecan ice cream, had bagel bites, organized my pack and food, downloaded podcasts and audio books, uploaded pictures, made calls and tried to decide between watching American Pickers and Exploration Unknown.

But first let's rewind to the huge raccoon.Last night I heard noises and cut on my headlamp. There was a big raccoon pulling trash out of the firering, grabbed it and walked off on his back legs like a person, ha! Then, the father/daughter tenters had to deal with him. I heard the dad yelling at it. Went out to help him rehang his food bag. Apparently the racoon was reeling in his hangline and nibbling on the bag. WHAT?! Next, maybe 30 minutes later, he jumped up into the shelter at my feet before I scared him off. Guess he smelled residual snack smells in my pack?The dad couldn't rehang his bag anywhere else because he didn't have enough line, so he put it in his tent. Awhile later, the raccoon was ripping into his tent. I've never seen such a brazen beast. Weird.Today I crisscrossed over the Blue Ridge Parkway several times and got to see some nice overlooks. No cars either as I think they are doing roadwork somewhere south, blocking it off. I love the mountains in Virginia. I try to take lots of pictures but also mental snapshots, where you pause and look at a view for awhile. You deliberately slow down and enjoy the moment. You think I'm relatively young, healthy and happy. Exist in the now, appreciate the view and forget everything else. Take a mental snapshot.Today I got to Middle Creek campground around 6:30. Jamie had informed me their camp store closes at 7, so I ran down the last 3 miles to get a birthday milkshake. And I did. I also got a double bacon cheeseburger, salad, and gatorade. Set up my tent on their nice grounds, got a shower, pulled out a bad toe splinter, and talked with Spongebob, who wasn't feeling well but swears the 2 milkshakes he had helped him. He's a very nice retired doctor from Hawaii. We were sitting in the lounge here, using wifi and journaling when 3 young kids came in saying it was their clubhouse but we could stay. The boy was talking about how this place is haunted by George Washington. He pointed to some old newspapers on the wall, and a black & white picture. “That's his head.” When reading the subtext of the picture it clearly states that it is the radar facility on Apple Orchard Mountain, which can be seen from far away.

I heard ripping at one point, and confused as to why no one else heard it, cut my headlamp on. There was a bear caught in the act of tearing up a second bag. I yelled at it and it took off. It had already stolen tenderfoot's bag. Just gone. The next morning, I took a picture of the bear marks on the tree. A few of us gave Tenderfoot food since her bag was gone.It was a blustery cold morning, but the wind pounded all day.

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544995,"This morning we cameled up at the spring on the way out, because there was a 12 mile section without water. I did end up pouring out half a liter, since I was carrying about 4 lbs of water, which I'm not used to. Early on, we passed a very sizzly powerline, and saw a bunny hopping in the trail. We heard what sounded like a bear cub crying, sort of like a toddler briefly wailing. We hiked a little faster. Later a deer right by the trail darted away and startled us. Today felt like a very long, constant uphill. The heat makes it tough. There was only one view today at an overlook, but Jamie and I motivated each other by singing Salt N Pepa “Push It.” It was a very tough day for Jamie today. 13 tough miles on her 2nd day is no joke. We each had a tiny tick on us. They are hard to see. Proud of Jamie, she got a blister on her foot. Ended up eating dinner at the shelter with Zero and Caveman, section hikers from PA. Met Patriot and TwoChains also. Now we'll try to sleep on rocks while Whipporwills endlessly call back and forth.Notes from Jamie: this was one of my toughest backpacking days ever! Hot, with very steep elevation change and I made the mistake of wearing something other than Darn Tough Socks, which is how I got a blister.

I spotted its movement after she passed it. It was slithering away. Blackrock Summit was really cool. Many big boulders. We climbed up it (not too far) and got amazing 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains. We hiked more and saw a black snake and a tiny snake. Saw a lot of bear poop on the trail, and 2 Chains passed and told us that a bear had wandered through the Blackrock camp site 15 minutes after we left. We saw a deer right by trail and Jamie got some decent photos of it. We resupplied at the camp store. There was a water fountain there which would spray 5 feet away. Seems like a lot of people get a surprise shower from it! Nice prank spot. We hiked .5 mi off the trail to the Loft Mountain Wayside, where we ate. Really good food. Jamie had a cheeseburger and fries, I had a salad and fries and guac. We both had blackberry milkshakes. A nice lady got us a bonus shake. She hiked most of the trail in 2010. She was wearing a happy baby.After lunch, we were hiking and a bug flew down my throat and I vomited a little. We saw part of the forest that was affected by the recent forest fire. There were charred logs and it smelled like a campfire. We finally made it to the shelter, where we debated tenting or not. Outside the shelter there was an ant civil war being waged. We also saw a handful of mice. After dinner Jamie was standing by the picnic table when I spotted a snake about a foot away from her. It was a young copperhead. Everyone was watching with headlamps and it went to a corner of the shelter where mice traversed and waited. It eventually saw one and bit it, but the mouse ran away. Then everyone started coughing. We thought it was a joke or something, but then we started coughing too. (Jamie comment: For a moment I wondered if copperhead snakes had some toxic gas-emitting power I was not aware of) A section hiker had accidentally puffed their bearspray into the air. The snake slithered off, and we set up the tent in the dark.Notes from Jamie: The views early in the morning at Blackrock Summit were amazing and just what I needed to get me excited about more hiking. Just beautiful. I can really appreciate the green mountains of the east coast more after spending a few years living in the brown desert of Phoenix. I'd like to revisit Blackrock summit sometime for sunset. This was a really snaky day, and I can't believe all my close calls! Seriously amazed Justin spotted the copperhead a foot from me when it was almost dark. He saved me! (I think the snake was more interested in the tasty shelter mice, but still glad Justin warned me to step back!) This was the day I truly understood why some people are wary of shelters. In a tent you have more protection from critters who might like to snuggle up to you.","Blackrock Hut

We hung out with them a bit longer and then Jamie's ride showed up. Very hard to see her go, the 2 guys said to look them up when I get to Wingap, PA.

Had a great time and made some good memories. It's hard to be nostalgic about things when you were solo. Today I met a semi-retired hiker named Hammer. We had a similar pace so we walked on together. You can get to know someone pretty easily out here if you're hiking. It frees the mind and lowers the defenses. He used to run his own real estate company, sold it, went to culinary school and became a chef and restaurant analyst. He helps restaurants cut costs and make menus more profitable. We hiked into Big Meadows wayside and had brunch. I had a blackberry cobbler, which was otherworldly. Finished there and hiked the rest of our day. I was a very rocky section. People who say Shenandoah is easy are lying, by the way. Got rained on a little and got cold. We joked about being the only 2 hikers in the shelter and sure enough it's true.

Just spitballing.Anyway, we got up at 6AM and arrived at 6pm. Walked allll day. It was exhilarating, exciting, and a bit torturous. I don't know that I'll do it again, but I'm glad I did. We kept a fast pace, took an hour lunch to eat, soak our feet in the creek, and relax a bit. We passed some different landscapes but the day sort of ran together. There was one rock field that was very difficult. When we arrived, 501 shelter was awesome. 12 bunks and doors. Better than some hostels. Got an ice cold shower at a solar shower, which just about killed me. Got pizza for dinner and hung out with Orion, Echo, Honeybuns, Conductor and Mouse. What a day.","Campsite

Not a superb combination.Orion, Echo, and I came across a cooler of nice, eclectic trail magic. Lentil chips, sparkling drinks, chocolate milk, quinoa treats and baby food. That's my first time eating baby food. Yeah, I did it. Not bad, ya'll! Whatever. Judge away! You're missing out.We decided to do a shorter day due to the rain and conditions, but we dubbed the last mile of trail the “human car wash.” Tons of leaves and plants leaning over and into the trail soaking you.We were first at the shelter, then Conductor rolled in, Mouse, Rucker, G Mon, EZ-E, and Flipper.

You don't see a lot of people where their venn diagrams of interest overlap in such a way.So today was a whirlwind of a day. Hiked 9 miles into town on rocks and went to a restaurant called 3C's. Echo knows the owner there and bought us brunch. We all got huge, delicious breakfast plates. Then we got a ride to Cabela's (the biggest Cabelas in the world, huuuuge) , where Echo and Orion got new shoes and I got a prolite plus pad. It has more R-value and thickness. I really just need to sleep better and I'm getting desperate. We then walked to a sporting good place where Orion bought a frisbee for future fun and we moved on to Wal Mart where we all resupplied. When we were outside stripping food packaging out and packing our food bags a kid of 17 or 18 approached us and asked if we needed a ride. We explained we were going to 5 Guys for lunhc and then needed to get back to the trail. Turns out he hiked part of it and wanted to help. So we went to lunch, I paid for his food and he dropped us off at the trail. We hiked uphill with terribly heavy packs. I bring up the rear. It's what I do. It isn't glamorous, but somebody has to do it. Orion is 21 years old and Echo has completed an Iron Man, so then there's me. In the back. We arrived at the shelter and G-Man, Rip Van Winkle, and Spike Weasel are here. 3 other section hikers that are a lot of fun. Rip Van Winkle asked me if I needed some snakebite prevention medicine. It's whiskey. They said they've been drinking it since the beginning and haven't been bitten yet, so it's working. Haha.","Eagles Nest Shelter

My poles are vital. Rocks shift, things happen. I'm always aware of how small mistakes could be disastrous. Pennsylvania (Rocksylvania) is pretty tough.Today I mostly hiked on my own with a destination to meet Orion and Echo. I just can't keep up and I probably shouldn't attempt to. Not with these rocks. But I catch them when they stop a bit. They were playing frisbee at this odd clearing with a few small observatory domes. Pulpit & Rock Astronomical Park. Had some good views today, saw a few snakes.Finished “Sand” by Hugh Howey. Nothing else much to report. We hit the superfund site tomorrow so that should be eye opening.

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546008,"It was quite a day to mark my 100th day on the trail. Saw some amazing things and some “old” friends.First our trifecta (me, Orion, and Echo) hiked a few miles to start the day. Carrying a little extra water because PA is dry like that. Early on we came across Trotter, who I had met in Shenandoah. A very sweet older lady who was unfortunately going Southbound and quitting 1300 miles about to end it. She was very emotional. She had bronchitis and Lyme Disease and couldn't get over the knife edge bouldering, which was just ahead of us. We told her to go get checked out and take a few days rather than quit. It was very sad and Echo prayed for her. Nobody wants to see anyone drop off at this point.Then we went up over Knife Edge, which was some pretty serious bouldering. Probably the most dangerous thing we've done yet. Great views and the bouldering was a lot of fun. When I'm walking, I get songs in my head, but they are always unconsciously in rhythm with my footsteps. So I told Orion I was going to start measuring our speed in beats per minute. We were going around 80 or 85.Today we passed Shep, California Chrome and Elle. It was really nice to see them again. Then we came to the shelter and there was Portuguese! Finally caught up to him. Echo hadn't met him yet. That was fun. Then Elle's parents had trail magic set up down at Lehigh Gap, which was amazing. We enjoyed that and socialized. Meanwhil the day got hotter. We finished and thanked Elle's wonderful parents for their generosity and kindness. It was tough on Elle to walk away from her folks again and I totally get that. We're so far in and it's been so long. Seeing your loved ones only gets harder and harder.So then we hiked up the side of a barren, rocky, bouldery mountain that was the start of the superfund site. This mountain was devastated by zinc smelting from 1898 to 1980. This is the Palmerton Superfund site. It was very rocky, very hot, and desolate in some places. Nice change of terrain, too bad it's an example of man's reckless way with nature.So among our trifecta, pulling an Orion is banging your head into a branch. Pulling an Echo is stabbing your toe. Pulling a Deadwood is showing up at camp an hour after everyone else. At one point today, I went ahead of Orion and Echo while they took a break. Then I took a wrong turn and followed the powerline easment for proably nearly half a mile. Then I realized no white blazes, verified with Google Maps, that I was off and hiked back to the trail. A few hours later, I got to camp. So even when I'm ahead, I still pull a Deadwood. I'm pretty sure there were salt crystals on my arms today from sweating so much. We talk about how bad we all smell, it's truly rank.","New Tripoli Campsite

We all dry camped last night and I didn't have any water after a few small Swigs in the morning. Hiked a few miles and had to take a .6 blue blaze straight down to a spring. Then the.6 back up. Adding a lot more mileage for water up here. Oh well. Now I know what it means to really, truly crave water. When nothing else will do. It's a primal urge. It's very motivating.Hiked a total of 10 miles over predictably rocky terrain and came down into town. I held my thumb out and after about 10 minutes got my first hitch! It was a mother of two, babes fast asleep in car seats in the back. She said she had to keep driving or they'd wake up. All I could think about was a low-stakes version of that movie ""Speed"" with Keanu Reeves. Thanks, Marky, for the ride!Anyway she dropped me off at the planned location, the travel Inn. Booting up my phone I got a text from echo saying they couldn't stomach it and went to the red carpet Inn. It was about a 10 minute walk, so I grabbed a milkshake from Rita's ice cream stand and drank it on the way, in the heat. Milk was a bad choice.3 filthy hikers with all their filthy gear in a tiny room made for an awful stench... So I did the very ungreen thing and opened the window and blasted the AC at the same time. It must be vented or we could die.I was talking to Jamie on the phone and they conversation went like this:Jamie: I think I need more exercise. Me: I think I need LESS.Echo, Orion and I resupplied at Giant, got lunch from their salad bar and ate those salads while waiting on laundry in the Laundromat. Classic hiker multitasking.

And yet... mother nature didn't get the memo that there is a state boundary here. There are still rocks!Let's back up. So on our way out of town this morning, we went to Dunkin donuts for breakfast. I had to do a little paperwork in the second office there, if you catch my not so subtle drift, and a guy just opened up the door. Boy, that's not a great lock is it. I only said ""Woahhhhh"" as my mind was stunned how he entered a locked bathroom. But you know what? You get so comfortable with things like this out on the trail that I was barely embarrassed at all. When I walked out and passed him I offered some advice. ""Watch that lock there.""We got a hitch out of the DD parking lot. Orion was the last to get in the bed of the truck, but the light had changed at the intersection and the driver hit the gas. Orion was temporarily airborne, but survived to tell the tale. Went to the post office to mail home some things that we shook down off each Other, then got lucky with a trail angel. He dropped us off at the trail head and his daughter wanted to hike with us and started up the trail. Might have a future thru-hiker on his hands. Thanks for the ride, Jim.Hiked from about 9 to 3 and passed a high school hiking club digging holes to put up a new information kiosk for hikers. The guy leaning on the shovel calling the shots (thats where you want to be) thru hiked in 2005. His trail name was Toepick.Saw Shoe, Elle and California Chrome again and finally came down into the cute town of Delaware Water Gap. Walked down the neat main street and then reached the village farmer, which is a fruit and vegetable stand but also a bakery and diner. They had so many beautiful pies and goodies in a very cool, quaint, unique interior. I got their special : a hot dog and slice of pie for $3. Then I got it again. Echo and Orion were there briefly but had already been there awhile so they took off. I saw Sherpacrow in the street, said hi and popped in the local outfitter to get a new bandana and pack cover. Yeah, I'm still losing stuff as fast as I can buy it. Impressive isn't it?On the way out of town I crossed the Delaware River and crossed into New Jersey. Hiked about 8 more miles and settled at this spot with the crew. The water here is brown. But we have a beautiful view of a distant Ridgeline and a nice grassy place to our tents. Lots of biting gnats or small flies, but there's a big pond not far ahead so that's not surprising.Also wanted to add that the Continental Breakfast here was one pot of coffee, a jug of orange juice, raisin bran, frosted flakes and milk.","Red Carpet Inn

Irritated that he had to go the other way instead of us.We passed by the beautiful Sunfish Pond. Sunrise there would've been amazing I bet.Ww reached the Mohican Outdoor Center by 10:30 and I had a breakfast sandwich, a York peppermint patty, powerade, and some peanut m&ms.

I hope it is better tomorrow or I may be forced to take a day or two off. Gotta listen to the body. I moved like a snail today but still reached the desired meeting point of the triumvirate (me, Echo and Orion).Went up another firetower today; the Culver tower. It was also locked, but the views from up there are great. New Jersey is incredibly natural. Lots of uninterrupted forest, as far as the eye can see. Very little farmland and housing. There is also more water and lakes down around the base of the ridge lines. I guess this is all left from a glacier a long time ago.

They squeak when you're 10 feet away and they dash to their closest hole. Unsurprisingly, most of them sound like chipmunks running through the underbrush, and yet some of them sound like polar bears careening through the forest. Is there any greater shame than being startled by chipmunks? If there is I haven't found it.Today I crossed through some absolutely charming farmland and through some very open and beautiful woodland. Lately forest that isn't choked with underbrush is rare, but this was exactly that. I don't know why this was so different, as I didn't see signs of a recent fire. Maybe the canopy is thicker, or maybe all those chipmunks eat everything leafy up. I don't know but I enjoyed it! There are also walls that are just stacked rocks that stretch for long distances. Perhaps this is all reclaimed farmland. There are lots of small green ponds too spread around, which would be perfect drinking holes for cows. Let's go with the ""used to be farms"" theory.It has been hot and humid, still very rocky and difficult and a tendon near my Achilles has been flaring up, so I had a lot of negative thoughts this morning. But you know what's amazing? The power of positive thinking. When a negative thought enters your head, if it isn't constructive, force it out. Force yourself to think and project positivity. This changed me day for the better. It really worked. Why dwell on the past, or what can't be changed, or things that hurt. You learn from pain but you also have to move on. Get positive and stay that way. Fight the dark thoughts and push back the shadows. Be thankful for all that we have. Force a smile until it's real. Uhhh... *notices everyone standing around and staring at me*... Anyway.Today I walked over many long sections of boardwalks through lush, green swampland. Nobody appreciates a good swamp, but I love a swamp! Swamps are nature's kidneys! Not to mention pretty.Met a hiker named Chickenfoot today. That was almost the name I picked for myself. I have a birthmark that resembles a Chickenfoot. I'm glad I didn't use it! No other Deadwoods have been discovered yet.I walked into Unionville today. A charming little village where even the shops and businesses used to be residences. I met up with Echo and Orion at Horleys General Store. We had breakfast sandwiches and resupplied there. Still hungry, we walked next door to Annabelles Pizza and each had a slice or two. Delicious!Today I met Twobananas and Javelin. I've seen them around a bunch but we hadn't yet met. I suppose they are together? I also met Livingproof, who is a 2 1/2 year brain cancer survivor. I don't have to tell you about how amazing he is.There are some weird red berries out here and they look delicious but I don't want to Into the Wild myself. But it's tough, you know? Thru-hikers are hungry all the time. Especially for fruit.Echo had a good point today about how she doesn't have as many nervous Ticks out here, such as biting fingernails and cracking knuckles. I didn't realize that the same is true of me. You do lose bad habits out here.The trio decided that our feet hurt and we wanted to go into Vernon for a shorter day. We managed to convinced Push and Livingproof to come with us. It was tricky getting a five person hitch into town but Echo simply asked a lady with a minivan and she took us.We tented on the grounds of a nice Church hostel. It isn't staffed, it's all just honor system and read the rules. Push, Orion and Echo had a tent setting up competition and Push won it.Trekkeroni (pepperonis on his trekking poles), Autobahn, Tortoise, Rucker and California Chrome were all also there. Chrome had a brown recluse bite that he went to the ER to get fixed up for.Me, Orion, Echo, Push and Livingproof all went to a Tiki bar named Scullys for dinner and drinks.

It was fantastic and they made wonderful, fat, buttery pancakes. That's the cure for a lot of ailments, probably.None of us wanted to do much hiking, so we hung around the church hostel and tool care of chores, phone calls and just relaxed. While we were having lunch on the lawn, we were approached by another hiker staying there saying he needed help inside and that two guys were smacking each other around. Echo and I went inside to investigate and whatever smacking occurred had already happened. Autobahn was on the floor, his glasses knocked off, and na Australian hiker, who had hit him xmas eating ice cream. Tortoise was crying. Apparently there was a disagreement about their stuff being spread out, and tempers flared and the Australian began throwing their things so he could sit down and the situation escalated quickly. It was very difficult to determine the truth between both sides, but we can all agree it could have been better dealt with. A police officer showed up and we saw ourselves out. I hate for these things to happen, but the reality is that once in a while they do. You just typically don't see it manifest out here on the trail.Echo's boyfriend, Rob, decided he would come up to visit and slack pack Echo, and Orion decided to slack pack as well. This is when someone takes the majority of your weight, just leaving you food and water for a day hike. Usually one can make big miles this way. But at some point I decided that I hadn't done it yet, and that I didn't want to. My pack is my burden and that's just how I want my hike to go. I don't want to give myself any excuses or shortcuts. That said, I totally see the appeal of it and don't judge anyone who does it. Hike your own hike!So I decided I would head out during the hottest part of the day, (great idea dumby) while Echo and Orion took a zero and would catch up by slackpacking tomorrow.I started walking down the road and almost immediately a black truck came up and the driver asked if I needed a ride. The driver was Mike and shuttles hikers all the time. He dropped me off and I started the ""Stairway to Heaven"": a 900 foot climb straight up rock staircases and boulders. There were a lot of section hikers, which means lots of breaks as people that smell wonderful, like laundry, pass by.To give my ankle a break I only did 5 miles to Wawayanda shelter. I met two cool section hikers, Andrea and Manny.I keep seeing Red Wing Black Birds out here and they are quite striking. Apparently their call is unique, as they say ""potpourri"" over and over.

The profile of New York doesn't look that bad, but the repeated up and downs are difficult and often going up and down on rocks or on rock slabs. The ridges up here have lots of big rocks that you walk across, maybe granite. It's nothing like bouldering in PA. These are larger and more curved and worn. But the constant up and down is tricky, especially when you're sweating profusely all day. Water is also scarce up here, which makes for more uncertainty and careful planning.When I crossed the footbridge at Longhouse Creek today, a day hiker named Kirsten told me that she was taking photos for some publication of the trail. She was big into the history and told me that it was called Longhouse Creek because Native Americans used to live along it in longhouses. The last native was seen living there in 1764.Had a few nice rocky ridgeline overlooks today. The wilderness of the North so far has been impressive.You know what's really nice? Picnic tables. As a thru - hiker it's just one of those amazing, rare gifts from a far off civilized world that allows you to ""sit down"" , which is when you get off your feet for awhile, or so I've been told. You can also organize gear and make and eat dinner. We will go out of our way for a picnic table. So this beer is dedicated to picnic tables all around the world (I'm taking a swig of water). Beacons of hope and civility in the dirty, untamed outdoors.Today I reached the road that leads up to Bellvale Creamery, the #2 ranked ice cream in the country, apparently. But before I walked up to it, I got amazing trail magic from ""Tentman"". He gave me an apple, asked if I take candy from strangers (Oh absolutely), gave me snickers, a meat stick, an Alpine Aire meal, a soda, a pair of Darn Tough socks (this is amazing and the first time I've encountered it!), as much water as I needed and even allowed me to charge my phone. Tentman has done lots of hiking, sells tents and gear for a living and gives out trail magic as often as he can. Not to mention he had good advice and stories. Thanks Tentman!After that, I hiked up to the creamery, ordered a huge sundae and a birch beer and devoured it all. Echo, her boyfriend Rob and Orion showed up after awhile and they all ordered theirs. Trekkeroni also appeared for a bit - he had camped at the drive in and got to see Independence Day 2 and another movie for free.After continuing to hike awhile, I got a text from Echo asking if we wanted to stay at the Tuxedo Motel.

The miles aren't coming as easily as they did in Virginia, PA, Maryland or New Jersey. I feel like I haven't been winded so often since North Carolina.Once I hiked up Bear Mountain and reached the Perkins Memorial Tower, there was a deer that came within a few feet of me while she munched on grass.Descending down Bear Mountain brought me into the Bear Mountain Recreation Area and Hessian Lake. A pretty little lake with a concession stand, where I got a Nathan's Hotdog and Gatorade. Next, the trail did something it hadn't done yet. It went through a zoo. The AT overlaps with part of this trailside museum, where there was a red fox (he looked sad ), a porcupine, a bear cage, other animals as well as landscape information. It felt weird to suddenly be in a sort of small, melancholy zoo environment passing swelling groups of excited children.Then I crossed the Hudson River on the Bear Valley bridge, passed a suicide hotline payphone on the bridge, and then hiked straight up until I reached the Appalachian Market, where I resupplied and got a quesadilla.

Honestly, I'm surprised I kept up with them for as long as I did. Good luck you two.Wow this terrain has been tough. I've been feeling as winded as I was back in early Georgia. These aren't especially towering peaks, but the grade of the trail is extreme, the steepness up rocky trail is very tough.Got to a road crossing with a parking lot where I could dry out my tent in the sun and eat a bite. Salami and Dirtybowl, a hiking couple whom have already done the PCT, showed up and liked my idea, following suit. It's important to dry things while you can, otherwise they can molder and get very funky. And not in a good, groovy way.It's tough being out here sometimes. On one hand, this is exactly where I want to be more than any other place on planet Earth. On the other hand, the person I most want to share it with and spend time with is my wife Jamie. And she's not out here. So I have these split dedications and desires. Like I'm constantly being pulled in two directions at once. I think this is why I can never fully be immersed in the hike and fully free to enjoy the hike. It'll never be perfect because a big part of my life is incomplete until I finish it. So even though I may be out here learning and growing and having a great time, I'll never be able to give all of myself to the hike. But you know what? That's okay. I'm still doing it.

Sitting in his tent in the dying sun, listening and looking for the mosquito that came in with me. He's too fast, I can't seem to kill him. He lands on the wall of the tent and I use my best wild west gunslinger quick draw slap, but he disappears for awhile then reappears somewhere else on the inside of the tent. It's a Mexican standoff. If I go to sleep I'll surely wake up covered in welts. Or it will drink me dry. These are the types of problems I have out here. Ha!Early this morning I spoke with Jamie about getting new shoes delivered to me at Cornwall Bridge, which I can easily be at in two days. New insoles as well. Pennsylvania had it's way with my second pair of Hokas. They didn't stand a chance.The hiking wasn't exceptionally difficult today. Went through some swampy areas, has lunch with Funfact at Nuclear Lake (didn't bring my Geiger Counter), crossed a long boardwalk over an overgrown swampland, had second lunch at Roseann's Kitchen Food Truck and some ice cream from Native Landscapes and Garden Center. Filled up on water from their hose out back, slung the pack back on and did another 6 miles.

I don't enjoy being negative and I feel an obligation to my readers and to myself not to be. But today I really only experienced frustration and fatigue.Ive been sleeping in later and walking very, very slow. The uphills leave me practically breathless, I sweat from head to toe the majority of the day and am usually so thirsty that I'm not super hungry. It's so much hotter and more humid than I'm used to, but that can't be the only thing going on. I hardly want to consider it, but it would really suck if I had contracted Lyme Disease and didn't even know it. The problem with Lyme is they are the same symptoms that someone who hikes every day would get, with the exception of a fever, which I haven't had. Soooo, it's kind of tough to say. Maybe it's just 3 months of bad diet and strenuous, nonstop exercise is beginning to slow me down.One big thing was that I crossed into Connecticut today. Only Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine left.Today I came across 3 little, young birds learning to fly. They were running around the forest floor chirping and jumping and flapping. Probably startled by my presence but it was really special to see.Only did 12 miles today. Not only was I moving like Jabba the Hut (have you ever seen him move?) but I knew there was a bad thunderstorm rolling in. So I got to the shelter, set up my tent and listened to the thunder approach. Wow. What a storm it ended up being. Not sure I've ever been in such a forceful storm, and then the hail started flying. I was honestly worried that my tent would be ruined. I left the shelter when there was a break. The rainfly did fine but water is pooling beneath the floor. So we'll have to see how that goes.

On my way to check into the Hitching Post Motel, I passed a Lemonade Stand raising money for Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation, which is the same charity that I am hiking for! So naturally I stopped to take a picture with them, got some delicious Lemonade and donated, and they decided to make me a burger while I was there. Erin, Brad and their children Quinn and Riley. Riley has done this for 12 years, every year around her birthday and has raised over 6000 dollars. Impressive.

So when I opened the door, I also saw the 16 Oz beer I purchased at the package store. I poured it into a Gatorade bottle to pack out, but then decided I didn't want an extra bottle with me either. So I had a morning beer. I was scared people would smell it on my breath and rightly assume that I was an alcoholic. But we all know this is a calories game. I can't waste them. I don't have a drinking problem, I'm addicted to calories.I had a nice breakfast at the Country Market and talked to a couple about the AT and the sections they had done.

Probably just the heat.Today when doing some road walking, (the AT does this more than people may suspect), I passed by the cemetery in Salisbury, which I remember seeing that, oddly, it was listed as a water source in my AWOL Guide. Sure enough there was a pump near a mound and grave in the center of the cemetery. So, yeah, I drank grave water (I filtered it!).I met lot of people today including a southbounder named White Buffalo who started on June 1st. It's fun and helpful to exchange information about what's ahead for each of us.On this very busy trail day, I also met Seabiscuit and Fugitive, Hedgehog (who started at Harper's Ferry), and JJ No Play.But yeah, there were lots of day hikers and weekend warriors clogging up MY TRAIL. Can you believe it? Haha. Isn't it sad that some thru-hikers harbor an air of superiority and ownership like that? Observe the ridiculousness of entitlement.Today while I was having lunch at Lions Head, a beautiful overlook, a family from Sheffield approached and had ashes to spread. I moved my stuff aside and said I would excuse myself if they wanted, but they didn't. I'm not sure how the person was related to any of them, but they left white roses and tossed the ashes off the cliff face in large white plumes of smoke. It was kind of beautiful, and none of them were especially sad. It was more a fulfillment and celebration of someone that had apparently been gone awhile. One of the older gentleman said, ""We'll, she's gone now. That's it. Now what? We're next."" Everyone started laughing. Then they were gone. Only roses and ashes to keep me company while I finished my lunch.Today I passed two milestones. I broke 1500 miles on the trail and I also crossed into Massachusetts. Yay for that. Progress!Had some beautiful views along the ridge of Mt. Race today, but there were two relatively tough climbs. Bear Mountain and Mt. Everett, which maybe felt a bit more like Mt. Everest. Straight up and all on rocks, I pretty much turned on the nitrous and got it over with. I drank a liter of water in about 15 minutes as I was drenched in sweat. Can I have winter back? I hope Mt .

I checked a weather.org and it was supposed to stop at 8. So, without a guilty conscience I set my alarm for 8 and went back to my unconscious drooling slumber.8 AM arrived but the rain kept on going. There was nothing for it but to break down in the rain. Sometimes, things are just going to get wet. Reading Man and Fugitive were already gone, which that sort of thing always lights a small fire underneath my drooly pillow.Hiked out with the Lasher (Long ass section hiker), Chad from Minnesota.

We hiked for most of the morning together and passed our first sheep on the trail, and ate some blackberries right along the trail. Not a bad snack.Ran out of water today.

There's more pine and conifer, more pine needles on the trail, as many rocks as Georgia still, but not as bad as PA of course. More ponds and swampy areas as well. It was hard to see the changes happen since it appears gradually to me. I wonder what changes I've already undergone and haven't even noticed yet. Am I more patient yet? What sagely lessons have these ridges bestowed upon me? How has my intestinal fortitude changed? Today I had lunch at Cobble Hill, where two hikers from Mexico came and sat. They were Goat and Chica. Goat is a yo-yo hiker, meaning he is hiking North to Katahdin, and back south to Georgia again. He has already been to Katahdin. He started March 2 and hash been to Katahdin, where his girlfriend joined him and now they were here in MA going Southbound. He joked that it was cheaper to walk back to Mexico than fly. He showed me a picture of the view we had from two months ago when he first came through. Bare trees and no vegetation. Wow. The dude was legit.Reading Man caught up to me and we hiked together for awhile. On Jerusalem Rd, there was a wooden snack stand just down the road run by the ranchers' children. Apparently they keep it stocked and everything. It was all honor system, $1 for a cold sodas, $2 for a Gatorade, and then snack bars and other things like duck and chicken eggs from their farm. There was also a take a book leave a book collection. A lot of thick books in there... And a hardback Larry King book... Really?After that, at the next road crossing we hit a Styrofoam cooler of sliced watermelons. That was indescribable. That sweet fruit juice is just what you need on a hot, muggy, swampy day. Very thoughtful trail magic from a couple in Tyringham.Eventually got to this hostel-like cabin, (Yay Push is here) and scoped it out. Very Evil Deady on the inside, and pretty stuffy in the upstairs bunk area so I pitched a tent outside where I could get some airflow that isn't from someone across from me snoring.I had dinner with Radar and Fugitive, and Bag Lady and a few other section hikers were there as well. Gus the caretakers young son was there, bumming Nutella and trail mix off of us and hanging out with us. Funny kid, and he did make us popcorn later. The kind in the aluminum Epcot ball. Anyway yes, there's a caretaker, and he mass produces pancakes on a huge griddle in the morning so that's going to happen.I went down to the pond to get a couple shots of the vanilla sky. Just breathtakingly beautiful. Geese were shoring and snacking on the bushes along the coast. Not a single house along the shore in sight. Just me and the pink ripples of a cool, mirrored pond. And then Sundog came down, got naked and went in. I averted my eyes and battled mosquitoes. We talked for awhile as fish painfully nibbled at his bare bum and once I realized the best part of the sunset was over, I came back to my tent. I'm just not big on swimming or really even getting wet if I can help it. I really just operate better on old Terra Firma. Ya know? I'm not much good in a body of water. I can swim relatively poorly and keep my head above the surface for at least two minutes. Plus I don't like fish smell, yucky toes on the bottom of the pond, or waterborne parasites. So that's me.

He had an ingrown nail that got a bit out of control.It was great to see Rob and he's talked me into not only a zero day tomorrow, but doing approximately 15 to 18 miles a day and he'll then come and pick me up and bring me back to the cabin for a few days.

I found a Kevin Costner action figure from the movie ""Waterworld"", so that was weird. Rob got McDoubles a wide brimmed straw hat, since UV is very bad for him while on the antibiotics for his toe. The pawn shop owner even (for some reason) had a clean McDonald's burger wrapper that we attached to the top of the hat. You know, for McDoubles.Rob then brought us back to his cabin, where we were able to shower and clean up. This was important because we all had a very important date with Jeff Goldblum. Yep, that's right, we went and saw Independence Day 2. Which I will say was fun, but absolutely not a good movie. On the flip side, it's not every day you get to see Jeff Goldblum twitchily drive a school bus of terrified children across a desert while being chased by a colossal alien.I joined Rob's mohawk tribe, what he calls hikers who stay with him and allow him to give them mohawks. And wow, it sure is way cooler. Also I feel like I like incredibly intimidating now. Or as much as someone of my stature can.

I wonder if this pair will make it to Katahdin.I walked into Manchester to the McDonalds and tried to use their wifi to arrange a meeting with a doctor for my eye. The video chat was successful but I couldn't hear the doctors audio. 3 times I tried this but couldn't solve the problem. The closest Urgent Care was in another town, so I decided that my eye has been feeling better anyway, and I'll just get some drops.I then went over to the outfitter to fix one of my trekking poles. One of the tips broke and slide inside the shaft. As I was buying replacement tips, Radar approached out of nowhere! He was buying a fleece for the Whites and we hung out and decided we were happy to see each other and tentatively hike together.We resupplied next door at the Price Chopper and I convinced Radar to stay in town at the Green Mountain Hostel. We called in to get picked up, and Jeff, the owner, was there in minutes. He brought us back to this beautiful home which had been converted into a very nice, clean hostel that is on a grassy strip of property with horses. Conductor was there, as well as Dr G and Mando. We were soon joined by El Auto, Chilipepper and Winterwell as well as a section hiker who lives near Lake Jordan, very close to Cary, NC where my wife and I live. It's weird to say that, when I definitely just live in the woods for the last 4 months, haha.Had a nice time talking with everyone as we all made our own dinners and had a meeting about morning shuttles and the upcoming trail. Jeff gave us each a surprise Vermont Long Trail Ale and also told us that the first soda in the fridge was free as was a pint of Ben & Jerry's Ice cream.

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546299,"7/16/16 - Lost Pond Shelter - Mile 1665.5 - Tent:We all weighed our packs this morning before we departed. With 4 days of food and 2 liters of water mine weighed in at 38 lbs. Wow that's heavier than I'd like. I can't even imagine what else I could get rid of! I use everything! I use a tent stake for a trowel! A contact case for neosporin and suntan lotion! I sent the brain of my pack home! What am I doing wrong? Granted, I've gained a pound and probably have 15 pounds of food. Hmm.Jeff, owner of the Green Mountain Hostel dropped us off this morning back at the trailhead. Great guy. Radar and I seem to have formed a bond... Or an agreement... Or an understanding. And we're just vibing it cause we've got similar senses of humor. It's been a lot of fun and the miles come faster.We went up to the top of Bromley Mountain, which is a skiing resort in the winter. It had beautiful wildflowers and nice 360 degree panoramic views. I started walking over to the chairlift that was running but blocked off with a rope, and a guy inside the little chairlift booth sort of leaned forward into view like ""don't even think about it"". Whoops! I was just looking... I swear...We lunched at Styles Peak with a very excellent view and met 3 southbounders named Rooster, Sonic (she had blue hair) and Woodchuck. They told us about doing work for stay at the huts in the Whites and we told them whatever they wanted to know about the 1600 miles ahead of them. El Auto & Chilipepper showed up and joined in on the shenanigans. I was joking about shortening words for fun, like you do, and El Auto had pepperonis and tuna on bagels. And added Sriracha sauce to it. So as I was packing up and leaving I observed this and said ""Look at that! Good peps, toons & bagues!"" To which he replied ""Sirach me bro!"" Then I started saying Rach me bro with a Jamaican accent, and now it's become a reggae song that I sing. So there's what hanging out with me is like.We were discussing how difficult it is to explain Rob Bird to people. ""Yeah you know he's an older gentleman with a white van who you may have to share a bed with, and demands a kiss on the cheek from you if you say thank you. It's totally fine."" Ha!So today I crashed and burned on the trail hard. I stumbled on a rock, tried to catch myself and stumbled on a second rock. At this point I had a lot of forward momentum and just smashed into the ground and rocks. My face even got some contact, my elbow helped break the fall as well as a smart water bottle, but my leg got cut up pretty bad. It bled a lot and Radar tried not to laugh too hard. But that was only fair, as he had slipped and flew to the side onto his butt today earlier and I had a good laugh. It looked like a ghost just pushed him to the right. But me falling... I wish I could have seen it from his view. Turning around and seeing my face down on the trail! Classic! I did laugh a bit, hesitated to determine how bad it was, and then continued laughing. Falling is funny, people. Ya know, until it isn't. I wish I had shaved legs so when I tear this giant bandage off it wouldn't be like pulling weeds out of my meat.Only did 15 today, as I was pretty done after the fall, and had dinner with Radar, El Auto, Chilipepper, Shoe showed up, Aquaman and his mom, Sharky, Dr G. And Doc. Good laughs and now the sweet relief of bed.","Green Mountain Hostel

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546300,"Last night it thunderstormed VERY close by our camp site and there was an incredible amount of flashing and light in the sky, most of it without thunder. Almost like flash bulbs going off. So I didn't sleep much. And that made today a real slog. But luckily I had my new buddy!I hiked another day with Radar and we're definitely operating on a similar wavelength. It has been great. Neither of us like to get up super early, we both enjoy complaining to each other and laugh at each other when we slip and fall. We riff off each other's humor well elaborate scenarios of nonsense. This could work out between us.Vermont is officially the mud pit of the universe. It's really, really muddy. And I know I've mentioned this before, but the bugs are also uniquely persevering and irritating and on days where it doesn't rain, you're covered in never-ending sweat. I hate Vermont. And then, suddenly, there's a magnificent view that makes it *mostly* worth it. Ha! No, honestly it has been both very nasty and equally beautiful, but I am ready for cold weather again. I'm sick of sweating so much salt into my clothes that it irritates the skin. New Hampshire is only a few days off.Passed by two rock gardens today, where people stack rocks up in great numbers. Also coming down Bear Mountain there was a view of the Rutland Airport. Pretty neat. Radar wants to get his pilots license after the AT and fly rescue or fire missions. Pretty cool aspiration! I envy his certainty!Ended up at the shelter, with a nice fire, with Radar, Conductor, Shoe, Aquaman (Long Trail), Sampson & Critter (Long Trail), Shiver (Long Trail), New Hampshire Bob and a southbounder whose name I can't recall but he hiked with a stuffed Pikachu.Radar gave me some melatonin so I am hoping l'll sleep tonight.

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546301,"Today, once Radar and I got up and out of camp, everyone is already long gone. We're not early risers. But before too long we passed a sign today that marked Katahdin as 500 miles away. So now a new countdown begins! I'll get this journey done yet. I'm starting to believe that it might actually end. Which is weird and exciting but also definitely sad.Today was uphill the majority of the day, and we got poured on at one point for 10 minutes or so, but heavily enough that we were soaked and the trail became a river. Our goal was the Killington Peak Lodge. But to get there, it was a .2 darn near vertically up wet rocks. It was pretty tough, and the wind was kicking us and the clouds were blowing by at 30 mph. When we knew we were almost there a couple coming down told us that they had shut down the grill and tourists were getting gondola rides back down the mountain due to lightning. We were crushed. We decided to go anyway and play dumb and try to get food.We showed up wet and stinky and sure enough the grill had closed, but we could buy snacks and fruit and drinks and beer. I got a beer, a cookie, a protein shake and a bag of chips for... 18 dollars. Wowee! Radar paid 20 for his. We ate our snacks grumpily and charged our devices as we took turns going to the bathroom to dry things under the Xcelsior hand blower.Then, after a while, the grill was inexplicably open again. We went to claim the burgers we had so dreamed about, and then noticed the prices. Burgers were 16 to 20 dollars. We deliberated for awhile and then finally made the incredibly difficult decision to not pay that much. We retrieved our Tortillas, pepperonis and cheese from our packs and had a normal, slightly sad, hiker lunch. At least we were drying and occasionally, between cloud bursts, we got some great views. We threw away our trash there, I cleaned up my leg wound a bit (keeping it covered all the time had made it look like zombie meat... It was time to air it out) and we finally left. We considered the extra mileage worth it, especially considering beers. Luckily, the rocks had dried a bit, so our descent wasn't half as treacherous as I feared it would be. Being in relatively high spirits, we found ourselves trying to learn to yodel on the way down. We pretty much yodeled.I'm glad I didn't fall here as it would have been serious. I've fallen several times in Vermont now. I don't know if it's the wet rocks, the mud, or if I'm just getting careless or tired. Probably all of those things. Gotta get it back together. It's funny seeing all of the Long Trail hikers. They have so much energy and are still jolly and make fires and things. Radar and I joke about how grumpy, tired, grizzled and jaded we are now. ""Look at them. They still have hope in their hearts."" Ha!My eye is thankfully better now. Guess it was a corneal abrasion or viral pink eye. Bacterial pink eye would've been the bad one, but all is now well.Radar told me a weird, funny story today.He said he was in Track and field in high school and they were practicing the javelin. Well, one of his classmates threw the javelin, but somehow a girl was walking down the field, and it hit her ankle and pierced it through completely. Everyone scrambled to help her and she handed her phone to the coach and asked him to call her mom. He frantically searched but couldn't find her. He asked her where she was, to which the girl simply replied, ""She's under 'Bitch'."" Ha! Well maybe now she'll be nicer to her mom!","Clarendon Shelter

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546302,"1700 miles! That's what milestones are all about! Woo! It's hard for me to fully appreciate that number because it has been so gradual, but I understand that it's a long way, ha. We're up so far north that even though the days are still hot and horrifically humid, the evenings are getting a nip to them.We're passing more and more southbounders now. At least a few every day. Sometimes there is a mutually beneficial exchange of information about things ahead of us both, other times it is nothing more than a knowing nod of the head. I have an idea what they've been through and they have an idea what we've been through.Radar and I always seem to come upon people going South on the trail when we're discussing the most controversial or inappropriate things. Punchlines taken out of context that make the exchange of niceties far more awkward than it needs to be. Haha! It never fails! We're up to about 5 times of this happening now. I think they just materialize behind trees when an edgy topic or tasteless joke has been stated.Radar, Shoe and I all went to the Mountain Meadows Lodge together for lunch. We were all singing Bohemian Rhapsody when we arrived outside the front door. When we walked inside what did we hear? Bohemian Rhapsody on the ukulele being played. Around the corner in the lobby was Juan Durer sitting by himself in a chair just grinning. So we all proceeded to have a nice lunch of leftover wedding food there. Soda, steak tips, potato salad, actual salad, a bagel and fruit. She brought it to us where we were on the couches and we had a nice time. Juan Durer showed Radar some things on the ukulele, and they both played different songs very well.After this meal, Radar and I tried to find the side trail to Killington. I'm not sure if we found it but we ended up hiking through a disc golf course and found our way to the resupply market after a short road walk.Later in the day at Thundering Falls we passed several families of Orthodox Jews. I don't know much about Jewish Orthodoxy, but none of them seemed to know about the Appalachian Trail or that people have ever hiked the entire thing. It was fun telling them something that they've never imagined before. One group was headed up the AT where we came from. They were trying to get to the falls, so a woman asked where that trail went. When we told her Georgia she called her family back down and told them they weren't going to the falls but to Georgia. On the way out of that area, it seemed like some of the families were trying to catch up to us and I told Radar I was feeling a little skittish, to which he corrected a ""Little yiddish"".Quimby Mountain kicked our butts today and we complained about how hard this still is, and wondered why we ""...aren't in good shape yet somehow?"" I guess we are but sometimes these never ending uphills make me feel like I did on March 12.We arrived at the shelter and Juan Durer greeted us with a ""Well there goes the neighborhood."" We had a nice evening of cooking and ukulele music. I wrote some simple lyrics to some simple blues chords and it goes a little something... Like this!When you're hiking in the evening and a something is a groaning you're a moaning cause you need a liftIt's time to eat again my friend or else you'll meet an early end, this belly aching ain't no giftHiker Hunger Blues, the hiker Hunger Blues, for me and youKnorr sides and ramen Tortillas are a common, pepperoni cheese mashed potataPeanut butta smotha pop tarts sure I love em, and add a little tuna for flavaHiker Hunger Blues, the hiker Hunger Blues, for me and youDon't let it get you down, turn that frown upside down with a mouthful of sour patch kidsA snickers or two will change your attitude, M&ms and a bag of trail mixHiker Hunger Blues, the hiker Hunger Blues, for me and you

Furthermore, that one of them, Paul Smith (actual name) taught Geographic Information Systems to Elizabeth Nelson, who taught it to me when I was attending the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I had found the teacher of my teacher! What? What!? Small world.We climbed two ladders today. The first one was a typical aluminum ladder that was roped to a steep rock drop-off. The second was ""The Lookout"", a tall wooden one built into the side of a cabin with a crow's nest at the top. Juan Durer was up there playing his ukulele when we approached. Radar and I had lunch up there while Juan continued playing. Beautiful panoramic views. I had the idea to take a panoramic picture but block the shot with your face as you pan the phone, but I think phones recognize it as too close and it won't go. No crazy distorted, elongated face shots for us.Hiking down to a place that supposedly had put, we both ran out of water. Whoops, we sure sweat and drink a lot.We reached On the Edge Farm, where we both bought fullsized pies, a quart of milk, a soda and a few other goodies. I got a tomato to slice into my rice dinner. We both excitedly drank our sodas and our quarts of milk along with half of our pies. We just couldn't anymore. They were heavy pies. We went from loving pies to hating pies so quickly. We talked to Rocky & Crash a while before Juan Durer showed up. We were happy to give him pie.We had heard that miss Janet, the trail angel, was down the road house sitting for someone, so on our way back to the trail we went to the house, met her, gave her what was left of our pies for her or other hikers passing through. She was very nice. It was cool to finally meet her.We hiked in our pie comas about 2 miles farther then set up a stealth camp by a stream. We nursed our pie babies.","Stony Brook Shelter

Passed through several small fields today and a few maple taps.We got to the top of a hill, sat down and recorded Hiker Hunger Blues. A bunch of Southbounders came by and enjoyed the jam sesh. I know I'm not a fantastic singer, and a ukulele isn't the most robust instrument but any music out here is valued.Just before we climbed down to VT 14, we crossed a bridge over the White River. Apparently this is a river where people jump off all the time for fun. I'm not a heights guy so it only took me one look to know that I'd document their descents rather than partake in my own. Maybe someday I'll regret not jumping and leaving my comfort zone, which is part of what this trip is about, even farther. But for now... I'm good. I'm real good. Haha.Right after the bridge Linda Hart has a house where she invites hikers over for sodas and chips and hot dogs and to stay the night if they want. So we went over there and hung out on her porch with another northbounder, Ranger. She used to be a Park Ranger. Anyway we all had a nice free meal thanks to Linda's hospitality.On the way out of town and back into the woods and up into the mountains, me, Radar and Juan had good deep conversations about things we've done and seen and what we want to do next. Juan has done a lot in his 51 years, and seen a lot as well. And he remembers it all in great detail, so his stories are full, like his Ayahuasca experience in Peru.It has been a good few days with these guys. New Hampshire well see you tomorrow!

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546305,"So, after a few nights of weird dreams of inadequacy, I finally had a cool dream to offset it. Maybe the coolest, if you're as nerdy as I am. And I'm sorry that this is becoming a dream journal, ha, but for some reason I'm having very vivid, memorable dreams out here lately. So, buckle up geeks. I dreamt that I was a Jedi Master, ha! I was head of a Jedi Academy. But it was a very long dream that spanned many years. I began as a student there, training with a lightsaber and in the arts of the force. I remember trying to pull my lightsaber to my hand from many feet away, and it would barely slide towards me after a few seconds. Eventually I improved and got sent out on a few diplomatic missions where I was basically a security guard for politicians. Then I was sent on some missions to fight some aliens.Years passed, as they do so fluidly in dreams, and whoever was in charge of the Academy stepped down, leaving an opening. By now, I had become an expert with the lightsaber and had the experience and confidence to teach and lead Jedi in combat if the need arose. So I got the position and was surprised by the respect I immediately received. I guess at that point my reputation proceeded me. I was a strict, but platonic and friendly leader. I wanted to be more human and empathetic than robotic and stern. I made many friends out of colleagues and students at the Academy.But of course these things never last, and we were attacked. In the middle of the night, dozens of dropships of Sith lords and murderous robots were dropped behind our walls. It was very sudden chaos and there was death and fires and students fighting everywhere. Like before I reached for my lightsaber across the room, but this time it rocketed into my hand without a moment hesitation. I put my skills to the test and began slicing and whirlwinding through the enemy waves with my blue lightsaber and redirecting bullets and lasers with blasts of the force. I organized panicked groups of Jedi Knights and teachers to rescue as many students as they could and to fall back into the training dome. Once we gathered up all that we could, I selected my most trusted friends, a small but fast group of experienced Jedi, and we snuck behind their groups, cutting them down from the back. Eventually their formations were broken and scattered and they retreated with what was left.It wasn't exactly a victory, and we lost a lot of students and Jedi teachers as well, but we saved even more and the school still stood.Sooo, haha, that happened. I don't usually read much into dreams, but I really enjoyed this one and was pretty encouraged by it, ha! Pretty cool of my unconscious manchild brain. Now back to our regularly scheduled hiking journal!Today was a great day for trail magic! First Radar and I hit a cooler with delicious, ripe, juicy watermelon.Then, Ranger caught up to us and we walked into Norwich together. On the side of the road was another cooler with delicious homemade banana bread!A while later, Radar and I were walking and a lady in an SUV pulled into a driveway in front of us and gave us two $5 Starbucks gift cards. She said she had been looking for hikers all morning. Such incredible kindness from people. Thank you all.Radar and I crossed the border today! Out of Vermont and into New Hampshire. I can't believe how far we've come. It's surreal and very exciting! The Whites are less than a week away now!As we entered the beautiful downtown of Hanover, we went to Lou's Bakery where thru-hikers get a free cruller. Crasher and Rocky were there so we sat for awhile and chatted. There were with a friend they met in Hanover, so we didn't want to take much time from them, so we moved in to Starbucks to cash in our cards.We got delicious iced vanilla coffees there and I ran to the post office to get my winter gear mail drop that Jamie had sent. I swapped out my 50 degree bag back for my 15, and sent home my fleece in exchange for my Puffy coat. Yes the days are still unbearably hot, but the Whites are coming up, are very high and very unpredictable in the weather department. People have died of exposure in the summer in Mt Washington, so Deadwood wants to be ready.I went back to Starbucks and Radar and I used their excellent wifi to upload pictures and communicate with the world a bit. I realized that I must've left my wall charger plugged in at Killington Peak Lodge, so I ran to CVS to replace it.Radar is a person with a lot of energy, and when he drinks coffee, I think he could power a small village. We had fun, and after a while Fugitive wandered in and we chatted awhile. Sounds like he may be doing the same mileage that we are planning.In random places around Hanover I met Sushi, GPS, Spielberg and saw Reading Man and The Professor. Lots of hikers out and about!After this, the three of us went to Ramuntos Pizza for a free slice of pizza for thru-hikers. There we saw Dr G, Sharky, El Auto, Chilipepper, and a few others! We got some beer and more pizza and everyone was happy. On the way out we ran into Juan Durer but he was staying at a trail angels house who had room for one more. Radar said he was staying with me (thanks buddy!) and Fugitive took the opportunity.Radar and I headed over to the Richard W Black Community Center for showers and laundry. It rained briefly while we were inside, and then stopped. Yay!Around 5 PM they kicked us out because it was time for ""Chinese Dance"". We got our mostly dry, slightly wet clothes out of the dryer and headed over to the Co-Op Food Store. Well, that ended up being expensive. But, ever since the beginning of this hike, a coworker of mine from Hanover told me to get McNamara Dairy chocolate milk in town, and I finally did. Radar and I each got two 16 ounce glass bottles, and The Professor added another 32 Oz or so to our bottles. We were so happy and miserable with milk. We even sold the bottles back for $1 each.After that we lazily hiked about a mile out of town to the shelter. I'm glad that Radar and I stuck together. We're a good duo and I'm having a lot more fun now that I'm able to laugh and share experiences with a good, like-minded person. The trail provides!","happy hill shelter

We past The Professor and caught up to Crasher and Rocky on Moose Mountain South Peak.After heading down, we hit a large trail magic gathering with two couples of trail angels from New Hampshire. There were a few Southbounders as well. Got a hotdog with New England buns, an apple, Gatorade, snickers, oatmeal pie and fritos.

We jogged down the mountain, avoiding most of the terrible rain but watching as big branches were falling around us and trees off in the distance were crashing. Pretty intense but pretty fun!We arrived at Bill Ackerly's property. It's a nice house with prayer clothes and a free ice cream out back.

Usually, we make the best time when we ""jack into the matrix"" or ""go under"", which is our slang for putting audio (music, audio books or podcasts) on. Poor Radar bought an audio book that he hates. So now he feels obligated to listen to the rest of the book. He still has 20 hours left. Haha! But it does help to distract yourself from the pain by disconnecting from reality. It really seems to help climbing mountains feel less like you're climbing mountains.We passed two hikers from New Hampshire who gave us orange and blueberry bread. Snowy and Tracy were their names. We just accept food from everyone and haven't even been poisoned once!The climb up Smart Mountain today was rocky and steep. Radar said it was sort of like someone took rock steps and then pulled and lever to turn them into a flat rockside. Like a cartoon trap. And you know what? He was right. It was like that.We went up the firetower at the top of the mountain and had incredible 360 panoramas of New Hampshire. We could see what looked like the Whites to the northeast, which is pretty wild. Things are about to get more intense and beautiful than anything yet. We are ready. We are hungry for it.Then we went up Cube Mountain and met the southbounder ""Snacks"" and the former thru-hiker ""Carpenter"" at the top.cl Crasher and Rocky showed up and we all decided we would stealth camp down a few miles farther by a brook.

The PITS (Pebbles in the shoe) were reunited!We hiked in a tight formation today, and we all talked about our pasts and futures and even how some cultures don't have tenses for time other than the present. Good stories were shared. We sweated together and walked at a comfortable pace, as we knew it was a slightly shorter day.We saw Doc, and leapfrogged with our married friends, Rocky and Crasher, also known to Radar as Rocky and Bullwinkle and known to me as Crash and Bandicoot. We ate lunch together by the road and met Ninjahoops as she came by.It's interesting, how I wasn't sure I wanted a group earlier in this hike. You can be so sure of a thing until you experience an alternative that makes so much sense you don't question it. When it works, it works. Don't mess it up. Juan and Radar are awesome, interesting people, and I'm grateful to be a part of this little group. After all, we're starting the Whites tomorrow with Moosilauke, and I heard it's much better and safer in a group.Heck, we're coming up on Maine. Coming up on the end of our journey. Faster than I had anticipated. It felt like it would last forever. It's so hard and so far, and then suddenly you're through it and it's over. It's beginning to feel that way.

Whatever comes next in my life, this is the only time I'll be doing this. This is it. This.We got to NH 25 and walked a quarter mile up the road to the Hikers Welcome Hostel run by Legion, who has done the PCT. The three of us had some ice cream, chips, pizzas, and loaded up on one day of pop tarts, chips and ramen to get us over Moosilauke. We'll resupply on the other side. This place had an amazing DVD collection, and Juan and I had been telling Radar about ""The Jerk"", so we popped that in and watched it. The scene where Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters walk on the beach at night while he plays ukulele and sings ""Tonight You Belong To Me"" rekindled my love for that song and for the ukulele. I had memorized it a year or two ago and could play and sing it. I miss that.Some southbounders came by, one with a bass ukulele, one with a cigar box 3 string steel guitar and a lady with a plastic trumpet. Everyone messed around together for awhile. I felt like I needed a harmonica or something!After that, we hiked about one mile up the base of Moosilauke for a strong start tomorrow. It's going to be a hell of an uphill battle.

It doesn't rhyme, it doesn't have a hard structure, it's convoluted and hard to pick apart. It's personal and probably pretty subpar, but it was nice to focus my creative energies into something for a bit. There isn't a lot of that out here. I am jealous of folks with instruments. Anyway, here is this wildly raw, intimate thing that I'm embarrassed to be sharing. Be gentle, because it's bad.SanctuaryThe shadows grow longAnd I become timid as the world fills with dark, unknowable shapesA world not meant for manI crawl into refuge and waitHeart beating in my chest, yearning, then dreamingStirred by the owl that owns the treesAnd the moon's patterns glide over the thin walls around meThis sanctuary will crumble and dieWill then stand again somewhere over the horizon Historic but aloneI open my eyes as the sky comes aliveThe owl is gone and the world glows with heatBut I see no oneI emerge a different man, heart still flutteringAnd I take another step Away from you, yet toward youUntil the end, when again I will see youIn our sanctuaryFor context, it's about this thruhike experience and how my tent is my physical refuge, but the love my wife and I have for one another is my mental refuge. Basically. That's it! Moving on.I'm pretty sure I'm under 400 miles left as of today. How 'bout it?Well, we did it. We hiked up and over Mt. Moosilauke. It didn't kill us, we didn't die and it wasn't the worst thing I've ever done. The uphill was certainly tough, but for once the downhill was worse. It was far scarier and more painful to the knees. Let me back up a bit first though.We hiked up the steep, rocky incline through the forest, into more old growth higher elevation forest, and eventually out of tree line.On our way up, we passed a sick moose that we had heard about from Southbounders. It was a beautiful, odd creature, but very sad to witness. It's just standing there and has been for days. I don't know if Fish & Game, or whoever is in charge will put it out of its misery, but I wish they would. Rumor is it has Lymes and is likely infested with ticks. Nature is so beautiful and simultaneously so harsh and unrelenting.When we reached the summit, we all took some goofy pictures by the sign. I put my tent footprint around my neck and wore it like a cape. That's maybe the best use of my footprint yet. I had that Superman dream after all...Unfortunately it was cloudy and overcast up there, so we had lunch and played music behind a rock wall. Rocky and Crasher were also there. We waited and hung out for over an hour, and eventually the clouds lifted in places and we all got some incredible views.The downhill was long, arduous and fairly steep. The trail paralleled a waterfall, but as a result the rocks were sometimes wet. At one point I started sliding in a bad place, so I used the last of my traction to jump into a nearby bush. Radar had a good laugh at me, but it was better than breaking bones!Once we were safely at the base of Mt Moosilauke, with shaky legs, we called The Notch hostel. They came and picked us up and took us back. It's a great big house with 3 floors, a hiker living room and kitchen, a camp store and lots of space. The owners, Justin and Serena, are young and very friendly. Justin played guitar with Juan and jammed awhile, while Serena brought in a giant bowl of greens and beans and peppers from their garden for us. This will be a nice place to zero.We all just sat around, ordered pizza and had a good time.I think I've realized that Radar looks like Van Gogh. Ha! Now I can't unsee it. Just have to lop off one ear.I got a look at Juan's Amazon checkout while he was on his phone. A 3 Harmonica pack and a big, black fake beard. He can't grow a beard so he ordered one to summit Katahdin with. Ha!","Jeffers Brook Shelter

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546310,"Zerooooo day. I'm not sure anyone really knows the meaning of lazy unless they've been a thruhiker and had a zero day. I wouldn't even breathe if I didn't have to. Ha! It's really nice to relax, but I get really sleepy on my zeroes, accentuating my laziness.We did ride hostel bikes a few miles to town today. Juan took the lead. I noticed he was ducking down and gradually pulling ahead. He's done multiple iron man so I guess he's pretty good at this stuff. I was just trying to remember how to ride a bike. I guess it's as easy as riding a bike.We went to McDonalds and had tons of breakfast biscuits, then went to the movie theater and watched Star Trek Beyond. I enjoyed it a lot. Very in your face action and not a lot of intellectual positing or heady material, but other than that there wasn't too much not to like. Definitely better than the second one.We ate a six pack of Klondike bars and resupplied at the Price Chopper. Radar and I really hit a food wall. Just getting the same stuff over and over and over. I'm pretty over Knorr Sides and tortillas and pepperoni and all that stuff. And there aren't really a lot of viable alternatives. We were moping around in there.I came back to the hostel with an 8 piece fried chicken for dinner and ate and lounged around for the remainder of the day. Took a shower, met some nice Southbounders and now it's bedtime! Juan, Radar and I are slackpacking tomorrow up and over Kinsman Mountain. They convinced me with very little difficulty. So we'll do 16 miles tomorrow but have another night in the hostel. Good times!","The Notch Hostel

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546348,"The PITS (Juan Durer, Radar and myself) all slackpacked today, so they were carrying tiny day packs and I emptied my backpack of some of its weight and of course used it. We actually felt strong for once, and something that is normally so difficult was only moderately difficult. These ups and downs in the Whites are pretty mind-blowingly difficult. But the views are undeniable. Still lots more to do in The Whites, too.There was some major mud today. At one spot Radar stuck the majority of his pole into the mud. Probably 4 feet deep.There was a beautiful pond on the way up, nestled into the mountain. That's not something I'm used to seeing - water at elevation.Then views from the top of South Kinsman mountain are some of the best yet. There is also a cool rock cairn chair at the top that made for some goofy photos.We got to the Lonesome Lake Hut, and hung out inside for a bit. They offered me some leftover tuna Mac and I voraciously ate it out of the giant metal bowl. Thank you! The hut and people inside it seemed nice.
Just as we left the sky opened up for about two minutes and then just drizzled.
We jogged the last 3 miles down the moderate decline to Franconia Notch.
Upon returning to the hostel, Radar and I ordered Chinese food and SpongeBob showed up!
Stephanie, who works at the hostel interviewed us 3 for her work on Humans of the Whites. Had a good conversation.

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546349,"So we packed up this morning and regretfully left behind what was probably the greatest hostel on the trail.The trail was immediately difficult and we sweated a bunch going uphill. These very steep up and downhills are strewn with small boulders and are very taxing on the knees. It can be a real slog. Until you break above tree line. Then it's all worth it. Franconia Ridge was pretty breathtaking and we all (Radar, Juan Durer, Crasher, Rocky and me) took a lunch break on Mt Lincoln.Juan Durer was extending one of his trekking poles by flinging it open, and the bottom half of his pole flew through the air and off the mountain. He exclaimed in vulgar horror as he realized what happened. And then we all realized and began laughing. We helped him look but couldn't find it.Only did around 10 miles today but it was one of the toughest days. It's really nice to have a good group for the Whites. Pain shared is pain divided, and joy shared is joy multiplied. Just heard that today.After hiking over Mt Lafayette, we went down until we got Garfield Pond. Then there was a climb up Mt Garfield.Tonight at the campsite we all shared two platforms. We ended up jamming with the caretaker, who had a guitar. She wrote and played a song about Garfield Ridge that she wrote and it was excellent. Radar is tired of meeting great musicians and wants to learn his ukulele in peace. Nah I'm kidding he had fun. Crasher gave us two harmonicas she didn't want. I'm sure our camp platform neighbors were happy to be near two brand new harmonica players.Just before bed Juan Durer accidentally put his clothes bag in the bear box and his food in his tent. When he realized it we all had a good laugh. He had it walk back.Walking is so inefficient, people. Ha!
It's a clear night tonight so I'm leaving my rainfly off. There is a great view of the sky and I've already seen two meteors go by.","The Notch Hostel

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546351,"I forgot about dew, and how dew works. Under an open sky, I woke up in the middle of the night and my sleeping bag was wet (no I didn't have an accident). I was a little chilly because my sleeping bag is down, and down doesn't function when wet. I got up and put the rainfly 0n my tent. That would just end up being another wet thing in the morning.Radar and I were the last out of our platform tenting area. We just know that's how it is going to be. The trail immediately took us steeply down a rocky path, which is coincidentally also where a creek wanted to go. So we carefully descending the wet stones.We arrived at the Galehead Hut, where we went in and had some delicious pumpkin chocolate chip bread for 1 buck. Then woman there offered us free leftover breakfast, which we kindly accepted. It was scrambled eggs and porridge. Then she brought out some mustard based sauce chicken from the night before, and bow tie pasta. We were very pleased. Very kind of her to do just because we're thru hikers. And in a way, magicians. We can make food disappear.After the steep hike up South Twin, we ran into Juan Durer who again, mysteriously, had two poles again. Turns out Bigfoot only wanted one and traded Juan. Well, that worked out well.Rocky and Crasher were waiting at the summit, and we all sat around and dried our tents and things.There have been lots of pretty Gray Jays up here, and we scared some grouse into a tree earlier in the day.We all chatted, had some gorgeous views and hiked to Zealand Hut, where we had potato and chives soup with bread for 3 bucks each.After this break, we proceeded to have the easiest and flattest 4 miles since... a long time ago. That was great.At camp tonight, I sat and caught the trail end of a beautiful pink sunset over Ethan Pond. I thought about my wife as my phone displayed no signal. Couldn't share it with her in any form. Welp, this one is just for me, I told myself. Sitting alone at the shore of a rippling pond, the sky on fire, the quiet and wind and water and bullfrogs all filling my ears. I felt very small in the scheme of things, but I also feel very capable. I truly believe I can do just about anything after this hike.","Garfield Ridge Campsite

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546352,"Radar and I were the last people to leave the campsite this morning at 9. It's our gift. I talked to the caretaker on my way out, a young man probably in college or maybe just finished with. He said for the first time ever, someone pooped near his caretaker tent, and also in plain view of the privy. Ha! So that's something.Juna Durer saw a moose on his way out of Ethan Pond, but he was gone two and a half hours later by the time Radar and I left.We started the day with a drastic downhill, which brought us into Crawford Notch. We met the wives of thruhikers Chopper and Mountain Goat, and they graciously gave us sodas.Radar and I caught up to everyone at the Mizpah Hut. We all got free leftover teriyaki chicken there! Incredible! Everything I heard about the Whites from people before I started this trail, and even during, was negative. That the workers in the huts aren't nice to thru hikers and will send you away and everything is expensive and people are rude, etc. None of that is true in my experience. The caretakers and AMC Hut workers have all been young, enthusiastic, easy going and very gracious. All that worrying was for nothing. This is the most amazing part of the trail yet. Also the hardest.I cracked everyone up with my trashfloss story, which is in a previous journal entry. Now my alternate trail name is Trashfloss.The rest of the hiking today was difficult and almost exclusively uphill. Up and over Mt Eisenhower, Mt Franklin and Mt Monroe, but the views were just stunning. Hard to complain when you're looking out over what looks like half of the world.After a great day of difficult hiking and good group chats, we reached Lake of the Clouds Hut. The weather held out for us. When we went in, the dining room was incredibly packed with weekenders. We spoke with someone about our options, and they were as such. 3 bunks remained in ""The Dungeon"", 2 could work for stay or we could push on to farther campsites. The Dungeon is a small stone room under the Hut that has old wooden bunks for 6 hikers. It's $10, but you don't have to work. Crasher, Rocky and Juan wanted this option, but so did I. I played Juan in Rock Paper Scissors best out of 3 and just barely beat him. Him and Radar worked for stay. But Rocky and Crasher have a double sleeping bag, which is too wide for the bunks, so all 4 of them are upstairs sleeping in the dining area tonight. Unfortunately they have to wait for people to clear out.I watched the sunset with Crasher and Rocky and we had a nice discussion about how far we've come and where we're going.This trail has been a wild ride. It's hard not to feel it coming to an end, and hard not to feel a little sad about that. I've met great people and seen amazing things. But, honestly, I am ready to be done. I've been out on the trail a very long time. I'm ready to be back with my wife and my cats. To spend time with my brother again. To take showers whenever I want, and maybe even for no reason. To cook actual healthy food. To take my life off of whatever kind of long but incredible pause this has been. It can't last forever, and, frankly, I'm sick of walking. Haha. At least for now.","Ethan Pond Campsite

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546353,"We were up early this morning and off to climb the final stretch to Mt Washington before 7.We got up or the summit in about an hour, and all took our pictures by the sign about the same time that clouds banks began to roll in. The park Rangers opened the main building so we could get in and get warm, but food wasn't available for an hour. So we hung around and waited eagerly for breakfast. It was a neat structure, with a video showing the extreme weather, a museum (too bad it wasn't free) a gift shop and Cafe.When the hour came around, they opened up the eatery, but there was no breakfast. The grill didn't open until 11 so it was just like snack bars, refrigerated odds and ends and things like that. I bought a muffin, some chocolate almond milk and some pasta salad. Lots of other people ended up getting nachos and cheese just because it was hot. Nothing says good morning like nachos for breakfast.We left after eating and watched the Cog railway car go right past and up the hill. The AT crossed right over the tracks.Then it started raining. We walked through rain and fog for hours. Up and down these seemingly endless boulder fields that made it seem like we were on the moon. It got very cold.After many hours we reached the Madison Spring Hut. This would become our respite for a few hours as we call changed into dry clothes, had hot soup, cocoa and lunches and tried dry out and warm up. More and more hikers filtered in from the bad weather. Many we had seen at Lake of the Clouds Hut and Washington. Croc with the nose ring, Deuces with the purple beanie, Lost and Found from Charlotte and Strider with the killer hiking pace.After several hours of trying to dry out and warm up, we put our wet rain coats and shoes back on and went back out. Down down down in the rain we went. Steep, slippery rocks as the rain came and went. The climb getting more treacherous as we grew more and more exhausted. We were all slipping, rolling ankles, swearing and taking our time.Juan kicked us off with some games to occupy our minds. We played word chain, name the states, name tree species, name Native American tribes, name rivers, name countries in alphabetical order... Anything we could to keep our minds on something other than pure misery. In the end we only made 3 miles in about 3 hours. Instead of pushing to Gorham, we all decided to stop early at this camp site and get into our tents and get our wet socks off. I will sleep like the dead tonight.

It was Crasher and Rocky. We all rode in the back to Pinkham Notch and started out hike up the Wildcats.

Rocky, Crasher and I hiked to the Imp Shelter and Campsite, our original goal for yesterday and Radar wasn't there. So we assumed he had taken a wrong turn, realized it and turned around and hiked until he saw Juan Durer and stopped. So they had to be together. I waited at the intersection for them. Only a few minutes passed and I heard singing. It sounded like Radar. Then Juan Durer came around the corner! Alone. What!? He asked if Radar was with me and then I got a little worried.We sat for awhile trying to decide to wait for him or push to the hostel and see if he was somehow there. While we waited, 3 Nobos passed us, Mola, Diatom and Helter. Eventually we decided to push on. Juan was having knee pain and I was drugged out and sluggish, so we walked in silence. There was almost no sound at all last night or today. No wind or animals. Bizarre. At one point, someone in the woods yelled ""Hey!"" out to us, and we responded but never saw anyone. Weird. Radar was missing. I felt like I was in a fog from the meds. I'm also listening to this surreal mystery novel called Pines. I think there was a show based on it called ""Wayward Pines"", but it's very odd. So all together, today felt odd.Eventually I came to hear voices and I recognize them as Crasher, Rocky and Radar. ""You son of a bitch!"" I yelled as I charged down the hill. Apparently he had just zoned out, hiked around the mountain instead of over it and passed the campsite in the failing light. Just that simple. Of course he could just as easily have been dead from one stumble on the rocks. When you don't know, it's like Schrodingers Cat. Radar was both dead and fine at the same time. We were happy to see him.We all hiked together the remaining miles until we hit the second road that leads into Gorham. We stopped at the White House Hostel to see if they had shuttles, but no one was going into town. Radar and I saw The Professor there and he bought us each a soda.We would have to hitch in. There was a lot of traffic as it is a big ATV festival this weekend. Pretty quickly we got into town. Resupplied in Walmart where I overdid 3 days of food by a mile once again.The hitch out took a bit longer but we finally got a ride from Roger, the town anesthesiologist. Very nice guy and good to know people in that position in case of injury!We only hiked a little farther out to a ""brook"" that ended up being a ""puddle.""

Which is unfortunate, because tomorrow is the Mahoosuc Notch.Anyway we all started on the wrong foot by having very limited water, which we would all run out of, and in addition it was incredibly, unbelievably humid in the morning. I was soaked within minutes. I thought Maine was far north and not hot?Today pushed me just shy of my physical and mental limit. There were moments where honestly wanted to quit. Rage bubbling down after I took a seat and relaxed a bit. Quitting now would be like quitting high school one week before senior finals. Let's not be that guy.I finished the novel ""Pines"" today. I enjoyed it, especially more the pacing toward the beginning. The tension is strong, but in my opinion it escalated too quickly. But there is a good quote from the book that I wanted to share. ""...Love at light speed. No hesitations, no regrets, no conditions, no reservations.""So with the humidity, apparently we all had crazy, agonizing chafing going on today.

I gave Radar half and we rejoiced.Funfact: Rangely is halfway between equator and the North pole.

A whole new life that I've lived out in the woods learning to want less, wait patiently for things, to listen when people talk and to smile when I want to frown. A deprivation lifestyle helps you grow up - even if you're already a grown up.Today I truly learned to laugh in the rain. Radar and I were hiking up the Saddlebacks and it was absolutely pouring. We passed by Rocky and Crashers tent as well as Juan's, but we told them we would keep going. We were already soaked and hadn't heard thunder, so we marched on. Up we went until we met up with Verge and Cheap N Easy, then we were above tree line and getting smashed. I eventually abandoned any hope of not being totally soaked. That's when you can enjoy yourself. The rain felt great. It had been very humid before. Eventually you stop dodging puddles because your feet are already soaked. We had fun hiking in the rain. We did the impossible. We reprogrammed our brains.We all had a lunchbreak at the Poplar Ridge Lean-to and Radar, Cheap N Easy and Spielberg all decided that they would pay for the shuttle and go back to the hostel again to have a dry night. I have basically all but run out of money at this point, so this was really not in the cards for me. I pushed on.Hiking in the rain is one thing, but hiking in wet socks and shoes all day is another level. Around 9 hours of hiking in saturated, dead man feet isn't great. My footskin was peeling off this evening at a level I've never seen. Pretty gross. But pretty fun too.I passed a Sobo today who told me that I ""...had a good spirit, man.""Arrived as nightfall fell close and saw Bigfoot, Toasty hand, Fire tears, Whiplash, Mumbles, Panda, Jelly and ...

It gives you incredible views where you can see forever and inspires you and even reminds you why all the misery is worth it. That was today. Maine is unbelievable. The blue skies and pine forests stretching to infinity, and the glacial ponds scraped across the landscape, glittering in the sunlight. Entire cloud shadows dashing across the mountains. All of it alive and there for the taking (in of).I caught up to Orion today and we chatted a bit. He caught Lymes before it got really bad, and I remember him having Doxy on hand for just such an occasion. He's not at full strength yet, but he seems to be recovering. We both shared in the view at Avery Peak today.The Bigelows were the last 4000 footer before Katahdin. The elevation profile looks halfway decent for getting in miles. Jamie booked her plane ticket, so I need to summit on the 25th, or 26th at the latest. Gotta make miles now.This has been an epic ride. More difficult than I ever imagined, more frustrating and beautiful and character building than I ever imagined. I'm quicker at making decisions than I used to be. I would sit and consider things for an annoyingly long time. Now I can be more patient, but I can also act when I need to.It's a very social trail and I'm not the most social person, but it has helped me to get used to meeting more people and approaching the situation with excitement and curiosity rather than dread. You can learn some fascinating things if you just listen.I've learned to be a better listener and I've learned the power of adaptation and adaptability.I've learned the power of small goals and that big goals are just small ones put together. I've learned a lot out here. About how far I can push myself, and that I'm capable of practically anything if I just apply myself.More than anything I've learned, even though I already knew, but relearned, every day, what's most important in my life. My wife, my family and friends. The value of time with these people cannot be measured. Spend the time with them and one day when I'm in my deathbed, I'll smile and know I did the right thing.

Today, I was so hungry I caught myself literally drooling while talking about food with Radar.As if an answer to my food prayers, an angel appeared. Her name was Jennifer. And she was driving an SUV down Jo-Mary road. She slowed down and stuck her head out the window and asked if we needed any water. I shook my head, thanked her and jokingly asked, ""Do you have any food in there?"" She nodded with a smile and pulled her vehicle around. It turns out that she had just completed a section and had a bunch of leftover hiking food. Radar and I grabbed Mountain House meals while asking her if she was sure and profusely thanking her. We also got peanut butter packets, Sweet Baby Ray BBQ meat sticks, Kind bars and a few other goodies. Radar was very excited by the fact that the meat sticks had actual sauce on them. I was equally impressed. She had two ferrets in her car which was interesting. I asked her if I could hug her and so we hugged.

Just a week ago, I bought my plane ticket to fly up to Bangor, Maine tomorrow. I never wait that long to buy a plane ticket, but I really wanted to be sure we had his finish date nailed down so I didn't end up spending days lounging around in Millinocket. So finally I made him commit to a date. He was pretty sure he could handle 20+ mile days in the 100 mile wilderness due to a pretty tame elevation profile. He's doing great of course, nothing like a deadline to push a person!We haven't seen each other in almost 3 months (since I hiked with him in Shenandoah), so of course I'm incredibly excited. I've tried to make the most of this time alone, but everything is just better with my favorite person! I fly out tomorrow, and I'm not going to bore you with logistics (I know I'm sick of thinking about them!) but the goal is to reunite with Justin tomorrow evening and stay at a B&B in Millinocket. I may or may not have encouraged my husband to try to hitchhike to town to avoid driving deep into Baxter State park and paying a $14 gate fee just to pick him up (Seriously, Baxter? That is steep for a state park!). If there's no cell phone service, we've worked out a system for him to communicate with me via SPOT checkins. We'll see how all that works out.I made a reservation for parking at Baxter State Park's Katahdin Stream Campground parking lot for Thursday, and apparently they only hold reservations until 7:05a.m. (Seriously?!) So we will be getting an early start to climb Katahdin, whether we want to or not! Cue annoying rooster sound. I'm pretty anxious about my journey up there, honestly. I have to count on the benevolence of the Airline gods to get me and my luggage to Bangor on time! My connection in Philadelphia is only 50 minutes, which makes me a little paranoid that any minor delay could set off a domino effect of disaster. I'm mostly worried my checked bag won't make it with me, and I really want my checked bag because it has my trekking poles in it! I hate checking luggage, but between taking trekking poles (which are not allowed in a carry-on), extra clothes for Justin, and my camping gear, I have to do it.So I'm going to try and climb Katahdin with Justin. I don't know if you realize this, but here in Cary, NC, we have a serious lack of mountains. So my training is not ideal! The stairmaster is a poor substitute for a mountain. Katahdin will possibly be the toughest hike of my life! We are talking 5.2 miles with elevation gain of 4,188 ft. And then we have to get back down.

We spoke with him and got checked in to Baxter State Park and I was discussing my plans to hitch in to Millinocket when someone in the group overheard and offered me a ride. That was the fastest hitch ever!I got in the SUV and met M'lynn and Arthur. They are the wife and brother of Paul of Paul's Boots. Paul was an Australian gentleman who dreamed of thruhiking the AT, but passed away before he could realize this dream. 3 pairs of his boots have been carried by various hikers along the AT to take them from Springer Mountain Georgia to Mt Katahdin in Maine. Two pairs had summitted that very day. It was a very emotional day for them both and I felt honored to have met such kind people.The other three guys in the car were Jaba, who had just finished his thruhike, and the two guys who make up Duct Tape and Beer Productions, and also the Dirtbag Diaries Podcast. They are filming Paul's Boots, the documentary. These guys were a lot of fun.Jamie was already on her way to the park when she got my texts that I was on my way to the B&B, so we passed each other like ships in the night. She finally got my texts not to go to the park (a lot of Maine has very spotty cell signal) and turned around. By this point, I was waiting on the porch for her when she pulled up. The feeling was indescribable. A rightness where it had only been wrong before. My wonderful wife!Now it's time to take a shower and gear up for Katahdin. The end of the end.","Rainbow Lake Campsite

Deadwood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549098,"Wow. The final day. I stalled writing this final entry because I had difficulty attempting to capture and make sense of all the complex emotions. But I will try.The day began after a long night of restlessness, as I was tossing and turning the entire evening. I don't think I'm alone in the ""Can't sleep before summiting Katahdin"" group. Jamie didn't get a lot of sleep either, as the air conditioner in our room was cutting on and off very inconsistently and noisily.Jamie and I had been trying to remember the lead singer's name of Fleetwood Mac for some reason. We vowed not to use Google and just try to recall it. That night, at one point, Jamie woke up and turned to me and whispered ""Stevie Nicks"". We both busted out laughing.So after getting little sleep, we dragged ourselves up and out of the B&B and drove down to McDonald's to pick up some biscuits. I knew it would blow Radar's mind and give him a happy start to the day.Jamie and I arrived near the entrance of Baxter State Park a few minutes before 6:30, and found ourselves in a long, long line of cars. Jamie had use the website to reserve a parking spot, but that becomes null if you aren't at the park gate by 7:05 a.m. We waited and waited and waited in line as cars edged closer by a few feet per minute. It's odd to have hiked so far and so long and to end up in traffic on your final day, barely moving, trying not to panic, well, it's an unpleasant sensation. Baxter State Park wants to keep the road (only one) primitive, so it isn't paved and it is very narrow. For charging $14 for entry (more than many National Parks), maybe they could go ahead and make it easier for people to come and go. I wasn't super impressed by how the park is run, if I'm honest.Eventually we get into the park and have trouble finding parking regardless of having a ""reserved"" spot. The parking lot was very small, with no clear lines marking each spot. We asked a man who had just parked a van if he could scoot over and make enough room so we could park in our rental VW bug (yeah, weird rental car) next to him. He gladly did so and we ended up chatting with him and his family for awhile. He and his wife used to live around Raleigh, so we chatted about the area for awhile. It's funny how many people on the trail seem to be from North Carolina. I've met so many.Jamie and I geared up and met Radar at the picnic tables. I introduced them and Radar's joy was palpable when I presented him with two breakfast biscuits. It would be a good day today.The hike up Katahdin has a few different phases. The first is wooded, only moderately steep and pretty relaxed. You don't feel like you're at the base of an epic mountain. Not yet anyway. We kept a strong pace, even as the day warmed up and began to get muggy. But, with luck on our sides, the sky was blue and relatively clear.We passed some beautiful waterfalls on the way up, as the trail parallels a creek for a while.After some time, we came out of treeline and the trail changes. It becomes very very rocky. Bouldery, even. You climb, squeeze, pull, hop, bust shins, push and haul yourself up and over these boulder puzzles. It was a blast. We had so much fun working out the best route and at this point the views were already incredible. The white blazes are kind of all over the rocks. I'm not sure if it is so you can have viable alternate routes or if they are older blazes that were left behind, but there were times where we all went our own ways and met farther up.There's rebar in some spots and more or less no other way to get up.At one point, Jamie was snacking on some fruit snacks and dropped one on the ground. Radar, walking behind her, immediately snatched it up, dusted it off, and ate it eagerly. No hesitation at all.Looking up the spine of the mountain is daunting, because the trail is all boulders all the way to the false summit. This is where the trail flattens out a bit again, but it takes a very long time to reach, and it's focused climbing. You are really concentrating, trying not hurt yourself.Once we were up and over the ridge, we could see another two miles or so, including the summit. The trail downgrades from boulders here and is just rocky. It's beautiful, and to see the peak where people were crowded with my own eyes. The end. The sign.I was excited, but not as excited as I thought I'd be. I honestly felt a bit muted. I think maybe it was just too much. It's very difficult to process - to catalog all the moments that led to this one. All of the people who helped me reach that sign. That beautiful sign.Radar had pushed ahead a little while before, so he was actually sitting at the sign and waiting. It was hard to know what to say or do. When Jamie and I got up to the summit, we waited for other people to take family pics and such and then I approached it. I climbed up the back, finally feeling the emotion, raised my arms in the air and screamed in joy. I didn't care if it drew attention. Let it. This was my moment. This was the realization of five and a half months of blood, sweat & tears. Of toil and tribulation. Of laughter, tears, excitement and boredom. Of hitchhiking, failing to hitchhike, of eating the same unhealthy foods over and over. Of making huge mistakes and learning from them. Of being sick, of being soaked, of being so cold you can barely take your shoes off. Of being so hot you almost passed out. Of seeing such beauty in this world that it did occasionally take your breath away. Of meeting some of the most inspiring people I've ever met. Of the Appalachian Trail.Jamie and I took Radar's photo next, then one with Radar and me, then Jamie and me. All of the combinations. Then we sat around, had a snack and looked out over Knife's Edge. It's a dramatic and rocky dropoff, and it looked like a few people were heading down that way. Not me though. Not Radar. We didn't care. We were done. Our goal was reached and it was time for margaritas. Ha!As soon as we finished eating, the clouds dropped down and started to fill in the sky. We had just beaten them. Heading back down the mountain, I looked back and the summit was already shrouded in fog. How fortunate we were in our timing.The hike back down was the same as the hike up, but the angle from above was much more terrifying. We were also tired and slowing down. So it took a long time to work our way through the boulders.On our hike that day, we ran into Patches, Cheap N Easy, Doc, Verge & her sister Legs, Farmer, Diatom, Soup and Orion. So many familiar faces. So many great folks.It's hard to put into words that final day. There was an amazing amount of relief. The pride of accomplishment. An excitement in regards to the future, and certainly a sadness as the end was here. It was finally actually here. I was a 2016 Appalachian Trail Thru Hiker. I AM an Appalachian Trail Thru Hiker. In the words of my buddy who couldn't be with me on summit day, ""How 'bout it?"" After 9 hours of hiking (total), we reached the parking lot at the base of Mt Katahdin. We piled into the VW Bug, and put on our Summit day song: S.O.B. by Nathaniel Rateliff. We put it on repeat a few times and belted it out.We dropped Radar off at the hostel in Millinocket, and then headed back to the B&B. I think a portion of the true gravity of the situation hit me in the shower. I started laughing maniacally.Intellectually I know the trail is over, but emotionally I don't. I know it will take me a long time to fully decompress what I've been through.We met up with Radar at a nearby restaurant that evening for one last meal together. It was nice.The next day, we drove him to Bangor Airport and off he went. Suddenly it was over and Jamie and I were on our way to Acadia National Park.So, when all is said and done, what is the main thing I came away with? Probably confidence. I achieved my life goal and it was by no means an easy task. Now I know for certain, if you put your mind to something and really work at it, you can do it. You can do anything. ANYTHING. Not a bad takeaway, since the sky is now the limit. I feel empowered. I feel lucky. And most of all, I feel thankful.The biggest thank you goes out to my wife. People don't realize what a sacrifice for her it was to give me her blessing to go and hike the trail. She supported me, emotionally and financially the entire time without hesitation. She is the hero here. I could not have done it without her. Thank you Jamie! I love you!My parents get the next thank you. They were my biggest fans all along the way and constantly offered to help me in any way they could. This trail is difficult, and nobody gets to the end on their own. We all need help and my parents knew this and helped all along the way. Thank you.Next was my fan club: my brother Chris and his girlfriend Claire, my grandmother, all of my friends who believed in me.And of course, all of the amazing trail angels. It's hard to describe the joy and relief of trail magic on a hard day. And Rob Bird, your kindness is humbling.And of course, thank YOU for reading!At the end, I ended up raising about $2500 for Alex's Lemonade Stand. I couldn't be more proud of my friends and family who helped me reach this goal. How amazing!And that's it, folks! That's the story of my journey. I appreciate your attention.
