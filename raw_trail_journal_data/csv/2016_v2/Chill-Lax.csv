Chill-Lax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522902,"I'm Bill, headed to Harper's Ferry to Flip Flop starting the 17th of April. I have 95% of my gear and I'm finding myself in a AT cloud....dreaming and thinking about the trail more than I'm in the present moment. My profile pic is of Ahuna Mons, a mountain on the dwarf protoplanet Ceres, it appeared to be an empty cat hole mound even though it is four miles high. Maybe someday there will be a trail that summits it.",,View Entry,"Mar 08, Tue",0
Chill-Lax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522971,"I have been pouring over my gear, what to leave in, what to leave out. I am trying to be flexible so I can make the inevitable adjustments on the trail without too much pain...but no pain no Maine! Will provide more in depth reviews as I shake out the list.","

Chill-Lax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523068,"I have been discussing my hike with an Air Force buddy, we are both memebers of the charitable organization Moose Lodge 2193 in Fort Walton Beach and he suggested we do something for the Moose Heart charities. I like win wins so we are fully engaged in raising money for this charity, it has been very warmly welcomed in our local lodge and is now taking on a life of it's own. My buddy JT Turner is organizing everything including an article in the local paper. He is also going to hike the Shanandoah NP with me. I truly believe this will be a great motivator and something to look forward to and think about northbound from HF to ME. We are trying to plan on hiking during both our birthdays, should be a hoot! It will also coincide with the Leonid showers! I'm psyched!!","

Chill-Lax,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523265,"I am taking the train from Jacksonville up to DC and over to HF, my buddy JT is taking me over to Jacksonville cause it is only REI in area. I am totally psyched and wished it was April already! Been hiking about 10 miles a day and picking up speed albeit flat walks it will help I'm sure. I am planning on taking a zero every week to work one or two days from the trail. I believe this will force me to slow down and also provide trail funds on my zeros. The folks at the Moose Lodge 2193 are very supportive, JT has hung a map of the trail and sign ups to support our charity efforts. I think they are going to do a pool on how far I make it, fun and motivation as well. Working on a trail name...stay safe.Bill",,35 Days to launch,"Mar 12, Sat",0

My friends are great I will miss the rest of what we deem civilized life for the tranquility of the forest and my inner thoughts. More importantly, my last day smoking ever!! I have wonderful friends and hope to make some more! I think we wrap ourselves around details and it clouds the real thoughts, such is modern life, I regress....see you on the trail.BillTatanka o feed me...","Home
