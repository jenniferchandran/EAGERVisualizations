Smilin' Jack,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533327,"I received a shuttle to the Race Brook Falls Trail Head where I got off the trail last year. The trail was just as difficult as I remembered it, steep and rocky in places. I hiked the 3 miles or so to the Race Brook Falls campsite (which don't count as trail miles) and ate lunch. I did meet a handful of day hikers along the way up. I met a trail maintainer where the Race Brook Falls Trail meets up with the Appalachian Trail and we chatted for awhile. I then headed up Mt. Everett and it was steeper and rockier than I had imagined. The one mile climb took me about an hour and a half. The trail coming down the north side wasn't quite as bad. The trail down to the shelters was muddy and slippery in places. On the good side, the weather was nice and I did make it to the Glen Brook Shelter where I tent camped.","Race Brook Falls Campsite
",Glen Brook Shelter,"May 11, Wed",1.90
Smilin' Jack,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533330,"The weather was good all day. The hike from the shelter to Jug End Road started out great but quickly turned steep and rocky. For nearly 3 miles I was rock-hopping down steep terrain. By the time I arrived at Jug End Road, my legs were rubbery and my feet, knees, and hands were sore. The next 0.9 miles to MA 41 was great! Then the trail turned into a long string of footbridges going through marsh. By the time I arrived at Sheffield-Ergemont Road, I was exhausted. The remaining miles took forever. I checked into a motel (I asked for 2 nights) with a whirlpool so I could spend the next day recovering. The next morning I found out that the clerk only booked the room for one night and I had to check out - the motel was full. I decided to head home to heal and return when I am more prepared.","Glen Brook Shelter

Smilin' Jack,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580679,"My first day back on the trail - I had a crown come off of a tooth! I placed it inside one of my pill pouches and continued hiking. It had rained most of the morning but the skies cleared in the afternoon. The trail was generally good, although there were some tough stretches. After setting up camp near the shelter, I met Lady Lumberjack. She was a medic in the Army and strongly advised me to get my tooth situation taken care of immediately! She explained all of the things that could go wrong, and convinced me to get it taken care of as soon as possible. I accepted her advice!","Housatonic River at Kellogg Road Bridge

Smilin' Jack,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580680,"I hiked out with Lady Lumberjack down to the Lake Buel Road parking area where she had parked her car. After running some errands, she delivered me to my truck and I started my journey back to my dentist! Within a week my tooth was happy and I was out of time and money for hiking. I will try again next year.","Tom Leonard Shelter
