Long Shanks ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504343,"My friends, it's that time! I've had an Appalachian Trail thru hike in my sights for far too long. Just like shooting a gun, tarrying can cause you to miss the only opportunity to act. I have pulled the trigger on the decision. On February 29, 2016 I will leave Springer Mtn., GA with one foot in front of the other. Carrying only the bare essentials (food, water, shelter, clothing, God's Word etc.) I will trek 2,185+ miles- the white blazes being my guide. Destination: Maine. I'm looking forward to the journey just as much as summiting Mt. Katahdin. The decision to embark on an adventure of such magnitude doesn't come without consequence, of course. Everything that is important to my day to day must be temporarily laid aside, such as family and friends. Just as terrifying, some things must be laid aside permanently- the city in which I serve and the department that makes it possible.                    
2016 will be my eighth year of service as a police officer for the Cty of Maryville, TN (a bedroom town to Knoxville). It is noble career, the benefits and pay aren't bad, and I love most of my fellow officers. I do plan on returning to law enforcement after my thru hike but I just cannot shake this burning desire. Truly, I am ever grateful for the opportunity I've had to serve thus far; however, as the saying goes, the mountains are calling and I must go.    Fortunately for me, I have an awesome family and a great group of friends who give their abundant travel mercies and support. They've seen how much I've enjoyed the ceremonial dining in South Korea. They have witnessed my delight after some good Canadian beer in Banff or some tasty Piña Coladas on some beach in Mexico. They have witnessed the pleasures of scuba diving sixty feet under water checking out awesome aquatic creations at Ginnie Springs in High Springs, FL. They've even saw the weeping of a happy heart overwhelmed by God's creative majesty while standing at the basin of Fall Creek Falls, as if a mere speck, but they can't possibly know my burning desire within to be inwardly blessed with such seemingly divine experiences. The things people can see and learn! The feeling of breaking the chains and vices of corruption that plague society, only to spend a little while longer in God's presence in his creative, poetic creation. The stories are unlimited but cherished by few.     The mountains are calling. I must go.

Long Shanks ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505107,"Hey, my friends! There is always that one person. Yup, contrary to the photo- apparently I'm being ""that guy"". When people understood that ""yes! I am indeed thru-hiking"" I was pleased to see passive conversational support or negative conversational support turn into active support. I suppose they realize that I have flipped my lid and have passed the point of no return. An acquaintance of mine, Wildcat (SOBO 2015) once told me, ""you don't have to be crazy to hike the AT, but it sure helps."" All the same, the advice received about selecting gear, invites to ""practice hike"", or assistance with a budget plan is much appreciated. The ""man, it's okay- just go"" kind-of-support is paramount, as well. For any and all efforts- I thank you. This journey is not an easy undertaking. Here are a few shoutouts to those involved thus far.   For my dog, Zoe: she is a black American Great Dane. Ya know, the world would be a nicer place if everyone had the ability to love as unconditionally as she loves. She doesn't scratch and claw her way to the top of the food chain. She doesn't betray the trust we have. She has never lied to me. Never stolen. Her ability to forgive amazes me. She has never made the six o'clock news flying a banner or flag. She don't care what color my skin is. She has never bitten my face off because of where I choose to worship.and she's never went sour with power or money. Oh, dinero can buy you a nice dog, my friends, and plenty of milk bones to go with, but only love can make her tail wag. Chew on that. For my hellcat, Angie: everything I've ever known I've learned from this cat. When you're hungry, eat. When you're tired, take a nap. When someone ticks you off real good, piss on 'em. The end.I kid. For my mother, Stacy: you have made some tremendous self-sacrifices in life. The sacrifices were usually geared toward bettering your three sons' lives. I believe those decisions are so honorable that words cannot possibly convey the magnitude of my gratitude for having such a woman as you around. Thank you sincerely for understanding that one season in my life is drawing to a close and another season is well on it's way. Perhaps it's spring. I will also be walking with spring along the AT- a sort of metaphor for life. With your blessing I will prance around in the woods for a few months. For my nana, Debbie: you, too have offered a sacrificial hand in ensuring that my up-bringing was the best that it could be. The times shared on the weekends while growing up were significantly more important than getting new clothes and shoes, having Ramen noodles and strawberry milk hand delivered to my basement estate, and the time spent watching anything other than Channel 2, 6, 8 and 10 (channel 12 if the antenna was turned right). Nickelodeon was awesome- still is. You made sure that I got a taste of life outside of the hills. The travels, the social settings, and the career lifestyle taught me a lot. I saw that there was a world out there to be a part of. For that I am grateful and with your blessing I am going to achieve yet another dream that some say ""you can't do."" My response, ""hide and watch."" For my papaw, Cobb: you've been a father to me. You didn't have to be. From tying my shoes and making sure I made it to the end of the driveway to catch the school bus at age five, to challenging a teacher and pleading my case at age twelve, to dragging me to church on Sunday mornings until age seventeen, to seeing me through high school graduation and the police academy, to blistering my hein end when needed (still not convinced that that's over). You didn't have to do any of that, but you did. All of the friends that I've met out in the world have told me that I'm a pretty good person and am nice to be around, so I suppose it was a job well done, eh? Most importantly, if you wouldn't have demonstrated your faith and taught me about Jesus how would I have learned? With your blessing I will accept this closing door gracefully and look forward to the next with eager anticipation. Do not worry about my career or any other temporary things that I must sacrifice because the Lord has always been with me and I don't expect him to leave me any time soon. I will not be journeying alone or without. For my Aunt Angie (Nanja): I am convinced that you often walk the line of ""super fun"" aunt and ""kinda-psychotic-maybe-we-should-call-the-authorities"" aunt. I kid. You are a wonderful, wonderful person and have been inspirational to many. When stricken with breast cancer five years ago you endured a lot of woes. I can't imagine, but you've shown that life is precious and nobody knows what might happen tomorrow. You've shown to live life today and not bank on tomorrow. I value your 100% support and with your blessing I will carry all that has been impressed onto me to the trail- even the memory of me whacking you in the head with a post to wake you up (I might get bored and will need a laugh). For my great grandma, Edna McMahan: my, my, my! What to say? I can write volumes about your beautiful heart. I love our special bond. It's nobody else's but ours. Do you remember tucking me in as a kid and telling me about heaven? I do. You told me that you and papaw would be going to heaven one day. You also told me how I can get there so I can see you again. Because I was learning how to ride a bicycle at that time in my life I asked if I could take it when I go. You said that you couldn't see why not. I then told you I was scared and asked if you and papaw Pete would wait for me on a bench outside of heaven so I would know where to go. You promised you would if you could. If the Lord calls you while I'm gone and for some reason I can't tell you goodbye, for God's sake don't wait on me on that bench! Go on in and enjoy the joy of the Lord. I'll be alright and will join you when I've traveled my last mile here. Of course I still have about 98 more years so give me a minute. I'm taking my time here- much to see. With my blessing you are free to go ahead and enter whenever the Lord is ready (which I hope is a long time from now) and with your blessing I will hike the AT and share your special song with other hikers who may be at a crossroads in their life. For my friend/my person, Jess: thank you for always being my special person (even though you're a Canadian) who insists on ""doing unto others"". It's radiant. Thank you for always taking care of me and being an advocate. I've enjoyed your friendship for the last five years and highly regard it. Without your support and hands-on involvement with this journey it would be much more difficult. Anyways, enough of the sentiments. (I want Sheppard's Pie, by the way.) Now for the crazies. For my good friends Josh Bolling, Adam (Cookie) Cook, Mike Lusk (Uncle Mike), John Michael Sparks, Kelly Edler, and Marissa Brown: when I first moved to Maryvillle I was alone. A new town, a new job, no friends. We all came together for a season in such closeness and I knew it was an answered prayer. A friendship with each of means more to me than a lot of things and I believe it's an eternal bond. Josh, thanks for the camping trips and encouragement to get outdoors more often. Marissa, thanks for following your dreams and taking the job in South Korea to teach abroad despite all of the fears and reasons not to go. You have inspired me to follow a dream as well. With everybody's support efforts I will whoop this beast. I hope to meet up with each and everyone of you along the trail somewhere. For my friends, Kolo, Jeff Tucker, Tony Saddy, Rick and Carly Hudolin, Jared Bible, Grant Gold, Brenda Shelton (and the gang), Audrey Worthington, Jeff and Pam (Payum) Wilson, Clay Anderson and Tosha Gibson (and the gang), and Ms. Debbie Shaver: each if your support efforts for this mission has meant tons. Tony, thanks for whipping me into shape at Get Fit Maryville. I gained more of an ""I can do anything"" mentality than anything, and I can and will take this journey. Jeff Tucker, thanks for allowing me to stay in your basement for the months prior to my journey. It has enabled me to save the funds needed for this undertaking. I'm also thankful for the unlimited coffee supply. It has nothing to do with the trail, but Bluberry Blend is my favorite. Kolo, thanks for the offer of assistance while I'm gone. A point of contact are very, very important. Josh, Jared and Grant- thanks for the time spent at Abram's Creek Campground. I was able to try out some gear during our camping trips. The rest of you guys, thanks for the pat on the back or the ""go for it"" kind of encouragement. For my Floridian friends/diving partners, John McCain, Bre Grant, Joel Marcheland, and Daniel and Sunny Vickers. The pleasure to know you is wonderful. You're wonderful people and I'm glad I was able to spend a week with you guys at Ginnie Springs. The diving experience was mind blowing. Importantly to me, you guys have shown me that it's okay to have fun with life. Words cannot convey my appreciation. Oh, I couldn't forget my Candian friends, Jay and Christine Doucet, Margaret Stadey, and Greg McLachlan: thanks for being so welcoming. You opened your home up to be during my stay in Alberta and treated me as family. You've reminded me that there are some great people out there and lifelong acquaintances to be made. I'm look for to reaching Maine (hopefully in one piece), but I'm also looking forward to meeting new friends along the way. Last but certainly not least, for Chief Tony Crisp (Maryville Police Department) and Chief Darrell Wright (Englewood Police Department): I am ever grateful for the opportunities to have served for each of you. It has been an awesome eight years and I have learned tons about people- life in general. Each of you have hand a direct hand in the travel path of my life and words cannot express my gratitude. A season in my life is drawing to a close (let's call it winter), and another is on its way (it feels like spring). As the season of life is changing I will also walk with spring along the Appalachian Trail. It's a calling I must answer.","Springer Mtn., GA

Long Shanks ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505131,"Zoe cannot go. I can't get her out of the bed long enough. I kid.     Zoe is an eleven month old American Great Dane. She's the kindest, sweetest, most gentle dog I know. She's full of loyalty; however, there are a few factors that prevent her from thru-hiking the AT with me.     Firstly, Great Dane's are known for their lazy nature. I'm pretty sure she thinks she's a cat. It's recommended that they don't do strenuous excercise (atleast until she's 2). Their hips are weeker than most breeds and I'd hate to put unbearable strain on her.     Secondly, dogs aren't allowed on the trails in the Great Smokey Mointains, which takes up a large portion of the southern sections. Also, most of the northern sections are rocky, tougher terrain that could cause problems with her long, lanky legs or her hips.    I'll conclude with, as if it needed to be said, I'll miss her a lot; however, she will be in good hands and I'll see her again when I return. We still have seven months (tentatively) to splash around at Abram's Creek before I set out.","Springer Mtn., GA

Long Shanks ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506780,"So here is one for that awesome creator of ours! I took a fella on his first hike yesterday. We summited the Chimney Tops in Gatlinburg, TN. We instantly became friends. During the hike we discussed everything from ""what does a real black berry taste like"" to ""is there a heaven or hell"" and ""what's God's big plan""? Somewhere during the conversation this fella knew that Jesus was ""knocking on his heart's door"". He knew he was a sinner in need of a savior. He knew that the gospel message was real and he was charged with a decision. When the conversation and the hike was nearly over we happened upon a teenager sitting on a log by the creek reading a Bible. To reiterate the importance of receiving Christ, we imposed upon the teenager and I asked the stranger to make a ""call for salvation."" This fella found somewhere in his heart to call upon the name of the Lord for salvation, recognizing what better of a friend than one who lays down his life for his friends. He recognized that Jesus loves him so much he took his place on the cross so justice could be satisfied and he could freely receive forgiveness. God says in his Word that ALL who call upon the name of the Lord SHALL be saved. This one is for you Jesus and Anthony Saddy. Go tell it on the mountain....

Long Shanks ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515271,"Hey, gang! Thanks for following. This is about my seven day journey through the Smokies- the best hiking trip so far. The decision to slice the Smoky Mountains in half from the most northeast corner of the park to the most southwest came as a whim. With just enough planning and just enough free time on my hands I was off on yet another adventure. On 09/27/2016 at approximately 1:00pm I arrived at the Baxter Creek trail head (located at exit 451 on I-40). With my pack loaded with everything I would need for a week without resupply and without much delay I put boots to dirt. I suppose I was about thirty minutes into my hike when my pace was brought to an abrupt stop by the distinct sound of a rattle. My blood ran cold. It wasn't a cute baby rattle. It was a rattlesnake rattle! When I looked down I immediately saw a large rattle snake sun bathing on the tread-way. It blended in perfectly with the fall foliage. After a quick examination (and a photo opp) I scurried around it like a twelve year old girl and continued my 6.2 mile hike straight up into the mountains. I passed about ten day hikers along the way. I eventually made it up to Mount Sterling Ridge Trail, where I would trek for another 5.3 miles along some beautiful temporal forest ridge lines. The ground was coated beautifully with mosses and ferns that offered several hues of green. The humidity was nearly 100%. I was literally walking with my head in the clouds (which isn't uncommon). It was a most unique sensation.When I connected to the Beech Gap Trail dusk was near. I hiked for .3 miles until I reached Laural Gap Shelter. I was thrilled to see one of Tallahassee Tom's legendary brushes hanging on a nail inside near the fireplace. I had read blogs where people have said that he leaves one at every shelter that he stays in so that people can clean up after themselves before they leave. Good deed for him! Way to go! I would have the hut to myself that night, except the two mice that I saw scurry across the dirt floor. I had a quick dinner using my RUCAS alcohol burning ""coke can"" stove, changed into some sleeping thermals, crawled into my Marmot 30 degree down-filled sleeping bag, and took my place on the top platform. It didn't take long to find sleep. When I woke I had a quick breakfast, packed up, and began my trek. Beech Gap Trail took me downhill for about 4.5 miles to Straight Fork Road. I took a short road walk near some horse camps and crossed a bridge. The trail left the roadway and back up into the forest. It was there at the trail sign I happened upon two equally proportionate sticks that some kind soul had left as a form of trail magic. I had never used trekking poles before but I thought, ""sure, why not!"" I'm so glad I did because over the course of the next 90 miles they saved my life (and my legs/feet) many times over. I trekked 4.5 additional miles, up and down hills and over ridges until I connected to the Enloe Creek Trail. The Enloe Creek Trail was 3.6 miles and I crossed the creek three times. Once was an awesome horse bridge (with the gravel trays) and two was a rock hoppers delight. No slips! By the time I made it to campsite #48 on the Chasteen Creek Trail I was beat. I pitched my tent and was off to sleep- for awhile! Until it rained. No. It rained! When I say it rained- IT RAINED! The next morning I had to take down my tent in the rain and pack in a monsoon. The tread-ways were washed out gullies. For 4.4 miles I followed the Chasteen Creek Trail downhill to Bradley Fork Trail. I was very near the Smokemont Campground at this point and entertained the thought of checking it out but I thought better of it for the sake of my schedule. I didn't need any search parties if I was overdue. I followed Bradley Fork Trail for 2.3 miles to Dry Sluice Trail. I had read articles about how tough the trail was but I wasn't too concerned. More excited to be there to check it out for myself than anything. As I began the immediate trek upward I thought, ""this isn't very dry"". I crossed over many brooks trickling down the mountain in a rush to find a creek. I was fooled! The 4.2 mile trail eventually goes straight up, leaving you gasping for air, with no water source in sight (except the downpour falling from the sky). That trail was by far my hardest feat. I was begging to get off that ride! But I eventually connected to the Appalachian Trail. I made a vow to myself a long time ago to not hike any of the Appalachian Trail until my NOBO thru-hike (beginning on February 29, 2016). I want it to be an all new experience; however, I'm very glad that I did hike the next 11 miles using the AT. It was actually the most fun out of the whole trip. Once I connected to the AT I hiked down to the Icewater Shelter. It was about four o'clock I suppose. Time doesn't seem to exist when I'm backpacking. Normally, Icewater Shelter has a panoramic view of the mountains, but it had been pouring rain all day and the fog made for horrible visibility. My thighs were chaffed and my feet were beginning to sting when I walked (trench foot). It was there I met two fellas from around Melbourne, Florida who were up for a weekend getaway. Good conversation and I'm nearly persuaded to try out hammock camping. Throughout the duration of the evening several other people filtered into Icewater (most were section hiking the Smokies' portion of the AT). Two nice ladies drifted in together, four older gentlemen from Florida were washed ashore, a northern fella who looked to be about forty, and a local man about my age. That night we all slept shoulder to shoulder, cussing one of the older fellas in our heads for snoring very loudly. In is defense, he did give everyone the disclaimer. The next morning everyone was up for breakfast using their pocket rockets or alcohol stoves, packing their packs, and one by one bidding farewells and continuing their treks. I was the third to depart towards Newfound Gap. When I arrived (approximately three miles later) I was slightly bewildered to see day hikers or tourists standing around in great multitude. It was strangely nice but off putting at the same time. I was ready to continue on towards Clingman's Dome. After about eight miles (all seemingly uphill) towards the highest elevation in the Smokies I reached Clingman's Dome. Again, more day hikers and tourists. I spotted a park service employee and asked if I could cook on my stove on the sidewalk. Somewhere during our conversation about twenty people gathered around us. ""Excuse me! Did you say you were going to thru-hike the AT?"" someone asked. ""I had a cousin that done a section of it years ago"" some other person volunteered. As honoring as it was that so many people took such strong interest in my endeavors, honestly, I just wanted to eat my instant mashed potatoes mixed with beef Ramen noodles on the sidewalk while enjoying the panoramic view of all of the mountain-scapes, and continue my hike- and that is just what I did. I packed up and trekked .2 miles down Forney Ridge Trail and connected to Forney Creek Trail. It was mostly downhill from there. I ended up crossing (rock hopping) Forney Creek seven times during the 7.4 mile hike. I made it campsite #68, too tired to reach my reservation at #69; however, some other guys were already there. I thought about becoming chummy so I, too could perhaps set up camp at their site but the drunk guy peeing on the trail in my direction was enough for me to muster up the strength and continue on to my reservation. Night fell on me as a result but that was okay. I can check night hiking off of my list! This is where things got creepy. When I arrived at campsite #69 I see an Eno hammock hanging between two trees, sort of sagging in the middle. Someone could be in it. Maybe not. Because of my naturally inquisitive nature I want to know where everyone is at and what everyone is doing (to get some type of vibe). There was nobody around the gear so I conducted a quick search around the site/creek and then a casual peek into the Eno. I spotted an Army pack inside and a fresh bar of soap laying on the ground nearby. It hadn't been there long enough for the rain/humidity to soften it. Someone was close by. It was dark, I was too exhausted, and I just had to bed down nearby. When I woke the next morning the stuff was still there, untouched. I packed up and trekked on, reflecting on this strange incident when it hit me! I was doing some trail maintenance with Frank LaFond (Ox) near Clingman's Dome a few weeks prior when we ran into a female hiker in the parking area who had just finished her journey. She reported having stayed in the Siler's Bald Shelter with a mysterious man carrying a 100 pound Army pack full of peanut butter and vitamins with plans to stay in the Smokies for one year. He allegedly won the Army pack from a fight. Draw your own conclusions. All I'm saying is- that was weird. Forney Creek Trail took me all the way to Lakeshore Trail (approximately 3.6 miles from the Tunnel to Nowhere outside of Bryson City, NC). It was at that trail intersection I saw the words ""Hi Mum"" written in the dirt. When I looked up I immediately saw some day hikers approaching. By this point on the journey it is strange to see people. It's almost as they appear from nowhere. Like a bad episode of the Twilight Zone. It was an older couple who were taking a day hike to meet up with their kids who had gone before them. The words written in the dirt were left for her. They ended up having a lot of nice things to say and I enjoyed our brief encounter, but off I went with about thirty more miles left of the journey. Let me tell you one thing: Lakeshore Trail is not what it sounds like. It is NOT a walk on the beech. If I went up one hill, or crossed over a ridge, or bent back around, I done it 786 times. Yeah, sure, you could see Fontanna Lake in the distance, but only about three of four spots do I recall coming close to the lake. I did, however, see the most wildlife along this trail. I saw two cubs shimmy down a tree and flee from my startling presence. I also saw four turkeys crossing the trail. I saw my first wild hog when it squealed and scurried up the mountainside. About ten miles into Lakeshore Trail I made my bed at campsite #76. After my nightly rituals I crashed hard. The rain falling on the tent was ironically soothing and I believe that is when I got my best nights sleep. The next day I continued along Lakeshore Trail until I happened until Hazel Creek. By far the most beautiful place along my journey. It struck me as a spirited section of the woods. I saw an old house along the creek bank that is now a ""trail shop"" (assuming the parks overtook it). I saw the remnants of old stacked chimneys and what appeared to be old logging roads. There were people fishing alongside the banks and it appeared the boated in were using campsite #86. I also encountered three hikers who warned me to cross the log foot path at campsite #90 because a hurricane was coming up the coast sending boo coos of water our direction. He affirmed that the streams would overflow and would be too dangerous to ford. So- I would continue on until campsite #90. Campsite #90 was awesome! Although I had it to myself, it looked like a fun place for large gatherings. It was right along Hazel Creek where the creek blended in with the lake. For sure it was good scenery. The flowing waters helped me sleep very well that night. The next morning I was packed and trekking like all the mornings before. Except this would be my last day. I had 5.2 miles before reaching Fontana Dam and my great adventure would be over- until next time (real soon). Lakeshore Trail ended and I took a roadwalk down to Fontana Dam and crossed over it. It was a nice release. Kind of bittersweet. When I made it to the Fontana Welcome Center the nice people in there done just that. Welcomed me with their hospitality. They were very accommodating in helping me make a phone call for my rescuer to come collect me. As I waited on my ride I checked out the little store next door where I bought an ice cream, two candy cars, two bags of chips, a Dr. Pibb, and a York Peppermint Patty. I talked to the nice clerk who continuously hinted of the showers just around the corner. Dually noted, ma'am. Duly noted. She was very sweet and I look forward to seeing her in the Springtime when I pass thru on the AT. I ended up purchasing a book called Hazel Creek by Walt Larimore and am currently in the process of reading it. It is loaded with information about Hazel Creek and the ole' Proctor community. It was but is no more.I was picked up and greeted by Jess with two large Dominoes Pizzas, some spiked Root Beers, and some junk food. I should go away more often.",,Fontana Dam ,"Jul 13, Mon",15

Once I connected to the AT I hiked down to the Icewater Shelter. It was about four o'clock I suppose. Time doesn't seem to exist when I'm backpacking. Normally, Icewater Shelter has a panoramic view of the mountains, but it had been pouring rain all day and the fog made for horrible visibility. My thighs were chaffed and my feet were beginning to sting when I walked (trench foot). It was there I met two fellas from around Melbourne, Florida who were up for a weekend getaway. Good conversation and I'm nearly persuaded to try out hammock camping. Throughout the duration of the evening several other people filtered into Icewater (most were section hiking the Smokies' portion of the AT). Two nice ladies drifted in together, four older gentlemen from Florida were washed ashore, a northern fella who looked to be about forty, and a local man about my age. That night we all slept shoulder to shoulder, cussing one of the older fellas in our heads for snoring very loudly. In is defense, he did give everyone the disclaimer. 
The next morning everyone was up for breakfast using their pocket rockets or alcohol stoves, packing their packs, and one by one bidding farewells and continuing their treks. I was the third to depart towards Newfound Gap. When I arrived (approximately three miles later) I was slightly bewildered to see day hikers or tourists standing around in great multitude. It was strangely nice but off putting at the same time. I was ready to continue on towards Clingman's Dome. 
After about eight miles (all seemingly uphill) towards the highest elevation in the Smokies I reached Clingman's Dome. Again, more day hikers and tourists. I spotted a park service employee and asked if I could cook on my stove on the sidewalk. Somewhere during our conversation about twenty people gathered around us. ""Excuse me! Did you say you were going to thru-hike the AT?"" someone asked. ""I had a cousin that done a section of it years ago"" some other person volunteered. As honoring as it was that so many people took such strong interest in my endeavors, honestly, I just wanted to eat my instant mashed potatoes mixed with beef Ramen noodles on the sidewalk while enjoying the panoramic view of all of the mountain-scapes, and continue my hike- and that is just what I did. 
I packed up and trekked .2 miles down Forney Ridge Trail and connected to Forney Creek Trail. It was mostly downhill from there. I ended up crossing (rock hopping) Forney Creek seven times during the 7.4 mile hike. I made it campsite #68, too tired to reach my reservation at #69; however, some other guys were already there. I thought about becoming chummy so I, too could perhaps set up camp at their site but the drunk guy peeing on the trail in my direction was enough for me to muster up the strength and continue on to my reservation. Night fell on me as a result but that was okay. I can check night hiking off of my list! 
This is where things got creepy. When I arrived at campsite #69 I see an Eno hammock hanging between two trees, sort of sagging in the middle. Someone could be in it. Maybe not. Because of my naturally inquisitive nature I want to know where everyone is at and what everyone is doing (to get some type of vibe). There was nobody around the gear so I conducted a quick search around the site/creek and then a casual peek into the Eno. I spotted an Army pack inside and a fresh bar of soap laying on the ground nearby. It hadn't been there long enough for the rain/humidity to soften it. Someone was close by. It was dark, I was too exhausted, and I just had to bed down nearby. When I woke the next morning the stuff was still there, untouched. I packed up and trekked on, reflecting on this strange incident when it hit me! I was doing some trail maintenance with Frank LaFond (Ox) near Clingman's Dome a few weeks prior when we ran into a female hiker in the parking area who had just finished her journey. She reported having stayed in the Siler's Bald Shelter with a mysterious man carrying a 100 pound Army pack full of peanut butter and vitamins with plans to stay in the Smokies for one year. He allegedly won the Army pack from a fight. Draw your own conclusions. All I'm saying is- that was weird. 
Forney Creek Trail took me all the way to Lakeshore Trail (approximately 3.6 miles from the Tunnel to Nowhere outside of Bryson City, NC). It was at that trail intersection I saw the words ""Hi Mum"" written in the dirt. When I looked up I immediately saw some day hikers approaching. By this point on the journey it is strange to see people. It's almost as they appear from nowhere. Like a bad episode of the Twilight Zone. It was an older couple who were taking a day hike to meet up with their kids who had gone before them. The words written in the dirt were left for her. They ended up having a lot of nice things to say and I enjoyed our brief encounter, but off I went with about thirty more miles left of the journey. 
Let me tell you one thing: Lakeshore Trail is not what it sounds like. It is NOT a walk on the beech. If I went up one hill, or crossed over a ridge, or bent back around, I done it 786 times. Yeah, sure, you could see Fontanna Lake in the distance, but only about three of four spots do I recall coming close to the lake. I did, however, see the most wildlife along this trail. I saw two cubs shimmy down a tree and flee from my startling presence. I also saw four turkeys crossing the trail. I saw my first wild hog when it squealed and scurried up the mountainside. About ten miles into Lakeshore Trail I made my bed at campsite #76. After my nightly rituals I crashed hard. The rain falling on the tent was ironically soothing and I believe that is when I got my best nights sleep. 
The next day I continued along Lakeshore Trail until I happened until Hazel Creek. By far the most beautiful place along my journey. It struck me as a spirited section of the woods. I saw an old house along the creek bank that is now a ""trail shop"" (assuming the parks overtook it). I saw the remnants of old stacked chimneys and what appeared to be old logging roads. There were people fishing alongside the banks and it appeared the boated in were using campsite #86. I also encountered three hikers who warned me to cross the log foot path at campsite #90 because a hurricane was coming up the coast sending boo coos of water our direction. He affirmed that the streams would overflow and would be too dangerous to ford. So- I would continue on until campsite #90. 
Campsite #90 was awesome! Although I had it to myself, it looked like a fun place for large gatherings. It was right along Hazel Creek where the creek blended in with the lake. For sure it was good scenery. The flowing waters helped me sleep very well that night. 
The next morning I was packed and trekking like all the mornings before. Except this would be my last day. I had 5.2 miles before reaching Fontana Dam and my great adventure would be over- until next time (real soon). 
Lakeshore Trail ended and I took a roadwalk down to Fontana Dam and crossed over it. It was a nice release. Kind of bittersweet. When I made it to the Fontana Welcome Center the nice people in there done just that. Welcomed me with their hospitality. They were very accommodating in helping me make a phone call for my rescuer to come collect me. As I waited on my ride I checked out the little store next door where I bought an ice cream, two candy cars, two bags of chips, a Dr. Pibb, and a York Peppermint Patty. I talked to the nice clerk who continuously hinted of the showers just around the corner. Dually noted, ma'am. Duly noted. She was very sweet and I look forward to seeing her in the Springtime when I pass thru on the AT. 
I ended up purchasing a book called Hazel Creek by Walt Larimore and am currently in the process of reading it. It is loaded with information about Hazel Creek and the ole' Proctor community. It was but is no more.
I was picked up and greeted by Jess with two large Dominoes Pizzas, some spiked Root Beers, and some junk food. I should go away more often.","Baxter Creek Trail

Long Shanks ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515275,"Hey, gang! Thanks for following. This is about my seven day journey through the Smokies- the best backpacking trip so far! The decision to slice the Smoky Mountains in half from the most northeast corner of the park to the most southwest came as a whim. With just enough planning and just enough free time on my hands I was off on yet another adventure. On 09/27/2016 at approximately 1:00pm I arrived at the Baxter Creek trail head (located at exit 451 on I-40). With my pack loaded with everything I would need for a week without resupply and without delay I put boots to dirt. I suppose I was about thirty minutes into my hike when my pace was brought to an abrupt stop by the distinct sound of a rattle. My blood ran cold. It wasn't a cute baby rattle. It was a rattlesnake rattle! When I looked down I immediately saw a grown rattlesnake sun bathing on the tread-way. It blended in perfectly with the fall foliage. After a quick examination (and a photo opp) I scurried around it like a twelve year old girl and continued my 6.2 mile hike straight up into the mountains. I passed seven day hikers along the way. I eventually made it up to Mount Sterling Ridge Trail, where I would trek for another 5.3 miles along some beautiful temporal forest ridge lines. The ground was coated beautifully with mosses and ferns that offered several hues of green. The humidity was nearly 100%. I was literally walking with my head in the clouds (which isn't uncommon). It was a most unique sensation.When I connected to the Beech Gap Trail dusk was upon me. I hiked for .3 miles until I reached Laural Gap Shelter. I was thrilled to see one of Tallahassee Tom's legendary brushes hanging on a nail inside near the fireplace. I had read blogs about him leaving one at every shelter that he stays in so that people can clean up after themselves before they leave. Good deed for him! Way to go! I would have the hut to myself that night, except the two mice that I saw scurry across the dirt floor. I had a quick dinner using my RUCAS alcohol burning ""coke can"" stove, changed into some sleeping thermals, crawled into my Marmot 30 degree down-filled sleeping bag, and took my place on the top platform. It didn't take long for sleep to come. When I woke I had a quick breakfast, packed up, and began my trek. Beech Gap Trail took me downhill for about 4.5 miles to Straight Fork Road. I took a short road walk near some horse camps and crossed a bridge. The trail left the roadway and back up into the forest. It was there at the trail sign I happened upon two equally proportionate sticks (limbs) that some kind soul had left as a form of trail magic. I had never used trekking poles before but I thought, ""sure, why not!"" I'm so glad I did because over the course of the next 90 miles they saved my life (and my legs/feet) many times over. I trekked 4.5 additional miles, up and down hills and over ridges until I connected to the Enloe Creek Trail. The Enloe Creek Trail was 3.6 miles and I crossed the creek three times. Once was an awesome horse bridge (with the gravel trays) and two was a rock hoppers delight. No slips! By the time I made it to campsite #48 on the Chasteen Creek Trail I was beat. I pitched my tent and was off to sleep- for awhile! Until it rained. No. It rained! When I say it rained- IT RAINED! The next morning I had to take down my tent in the rain and pack in a monsoon. The tread-ways were washed out gullies. For 4.4 miles I followed the Chasteen Creek Trail downhill to Bradley Fork Trail. I was very near the Smokemont Campground at this point and entertained the thought of checking it out but I thought better of it for the sake of my schedule. I didn't need any search parties if I was overdue. I followed Bradley Fork Trail for 2.3 miles to Dry Sluice Trail. I had read articles about how tough the trail was but I wasn't too concerned. More excited to be there to check it out for myself than anything. As I began the immediate trek upward I thought, ""this isn't very dry"". I crossed over many brooks trickling down the mountain in a rush to find a creek. I was fooled! The 4.2 mile trail eventually goes straight up, leaving you gasping for air, with no water source in sight (except the pouring rain falling from the sky). That trail was by far my hardest feat. I was begging to get off that ride! But I eventually connected to the Appalachian Trail. I made a vow to myself a long time ago to not hike any of the Appalachian Trail until my NOBO thru-hike (beginning on February 29, 2016). I want it to be an all new experience; however, I'm very glad that I did hike the next 11 miles using the AT. It was actually the most fun out of the whole trip.

It was but is no more.I was picked up and greeted by Jess with two large Dominoes Pizzas, some spiked Root Beers, and some junk food. I should go away more often.",,Fontana Dam,"Jul 14, Tue",20
Long Shanks ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520211,"To have a hiking buddy or to not have a hiking buddy... that WAS the question. A few months ago I was contacted via this Page by a fella from Pennsylvania named Curtis Libby. He was starting his NOBO Appalachian Trail thru hike on the same date as me and was looking to connect with other hikers that would be in his close proximity. After communicating back and forth for a bit he not only demonstrated awesome characteristics of a hiking buddy, but also that of a friend. This past weekend I went to Pennsylania to hang out with him and his family/friends. Awesome people! I am thankful for the connections. Curt will be taking a bus to the south during the first week of March, we will hang out in Tennessee until my first neice (Serenity Faith Harris) is born (March 6ish), and then we will hit the trail! Hoorah!","Springer Mtn., GA

Due to the lack of WiFi along the trail I won't be able to update via Trail Journals as often as I wish. I'm also journaling to compile a book and don't want too many details out there before its compete. It's an unfolding adventure! I use www.facebook.com/longshanks2016 most often for updates... I began the AT March 7 and have made it to Franklin on day 9. Everyone is doing well and this is an epic journey.","Springer Mtn., GA
