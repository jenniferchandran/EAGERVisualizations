Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524649,"Wow in 10 short days I begin the trip south to Georgia. The Stars have aligned and I have been blessed with the opportunity to do this thru hike. It was something I have always wanted to do since college. I was kicking myself for not doing this right after graduating but life got in the way. Now at 38 my husband and I have sold our house and moved to New York. With the sudden change and me not having to work right now it dawned on me I could really do this and here we are 10 days away from reality of it. When I announced to the world I was doing this a good friend of mine asked me if I would be offended if she join me. I was like "" are you serious?"" We spent the next 7 months prepping, buying gear, trying gear and doing practice hikes and overnights in the woods. Most of the time laughing at the absurdity of what we were attempting to do. People will look at us as the odd couple.   Hey that may just become our tandem trail name... Tick toc, Tick Toc.",,Massachusetts ,"Mar 23, Wed",0
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524655,"Did a quick trip up to Massachusetts for a teeth cleaning and a visit with Sharon. We have done our gear shake down and are going to do some basic prep. Reviewing the guide book for the first 45 miles just to familiarize ourselves with springs, shelters etc. We have already agreed to take it slow and to really pay attention to our feet. I have done a lot of training with my pack hiking in the Catskills of New York. Sharon has done some with me but most had been in the gym.",,Massachusetts,"Mar 24, Thu",0
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524656,Heading back to the Catskills after my teeth cleaning and some pre-trail prep. Holy crap we are down to 10 days. Jeff booked the rental car which we will be picking up on April 2nd. I will be back up to Massachusetts to pick Sharon up on March 31. We start our drive to Georgia April 3rd. It's becoming more real by the minute. ????,,Tannersville ,"Mar 25, Fri",0
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524875,When a college friend found out I was doing a thru hike of the Appalachian Trail he asked me to do him a favor. See his dad had a love for the AT and hiked the entire section of it in Maine. He made a walking stick from a tree branch which he used while he hiked the Maine section of the AT. With his failing health he was unable to continue on long hikes. His dad became a Trail Angel in Maine bringing dry socks and goodies to the shelters along the trail. In June 2015 he lost his battle with cancer and was never able to complete his dream of thru hiking. Well his walking stick was just mailed to me from Maine and arrived today in the Catskills of New York. My college friend asked me if I would bring his dad's walking stick to the summit of Springer in hopes it makes it to Katahdin I'm not only bringing it to Springer but feel compelled to make sure it travels all the way to Katahdin. To be entrusted with such a cherished object I'm moved to beyond words. I have another motivator to get my butt to Katahdin. Keep yours eyes open for the odd couple carrying a unique walking stick. We are down to 8 days to starting our drive from New York to Georgia. Boots hit the ground April 6th.,,Home,"Mar 25, Fri",0
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525033,"In just 7 short days I get in the car and head south with Sharon to Georgia. Jeff and his dad are driving us south. Leaving home and leaving my guy Jeff, 2 cats and our dog Sandy is going to be the hardest part of the trail for me. I want to take the time to fully thank my husband Jeff for supporting me in this venture. It's going to be just as hard on him as it will be on me. Working full time and completely taking care of the house and 3 pets is going to be a lot of work. I would never be able to attempt this without his support. Last minute prep is happening. I keep unpacking and repacking my bag trying to reduce weight.",,View Entry,"Mar 26, Sat",0
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525222,In my normal life I'm the volunteer Lean-To Chair here in the Catskill Park in New York State. I oversee the maintainers here in the park and we cover 32 lean-to's. We are volunteers through the New York New Jersey Trail Conference based out of Jersey. This club was the first to build the very first section of the AT on Bear Mountain and they continue to maintain that section as well as sections of the trail both in Jersey and New York. Part of my responsibilities as the lean-to chair is to visit all the lean-to's. Well what better way to train and condition ones self then to go to lean-to after lean-to here in the park. If you have ever been to and hiked trails in the Catskills they are not flat not gradual. They go up and then down. I walked up to John Robb lean-to on Hunter Mountain. This is the same mountain that has the ski area with the same name. Here are pictures from the day.,,Spruceton Valley Road,"Mar 28, Mon",0
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525515,"Did my last hike for my training and conditioning today. Total of 10 miles with the dogs. It will be my last walk with them until I get back. Very bittersweet as we have been attached by the hip for the last three months. My father in-law said I'm the pied piper to the dogs. When I walk in at the in-laws a walk is assumed and they jump up and immediately are ready. Sometimes they run outside and jump into the car before I can even get out. I would love to take them but that would be impossible to juggle 2 dogs and taking only one the other would be severely depressed. Hopefully they will be driven to me to do small sections. Today I walked the Ashokan High Point which is a 9 mile loop. We explored the top and walked back and forth the 1/2 mile summit adding another mile. In three days I have hiked about 27 miles. I feel fantastic, the feet are good, the legs are good. I can feel my body is so much stronger than it was around Christmas. Thank god for the Catskill mountains in New York that helped in my training. The steep peaks and crazy rocky trails will help me go ""oh this isn't bad"" when I get on the AT. I'm in the process of doing a go-fund me campaign to raise money for the Catskill Park to give back. Due to budget cuts the park does not get very much funding and is in need. My hope is I can do my part. This was my last big walk before my boots hit the ground In a week. The next 3 days will be spent going to Massachusetts to say goodbye to my mother and sister. Then back here Saturday morning to spray all my gear with Permethrin, dry and then repacking my pack one last time. Double checking, do I have everything I need and can I take anything out of my pack. Keep getting that weight down. 7 days!!! ????????",,View Entry,"Mar 29, Tue",10
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525905,Drove to Massachusetts to say goodbye to family and friends and to pick up Sharon. We were kind of holding our breath because she had massive knee pain out of the blue on Tuesday. She thought maybe something got torn on our practice hike 2 weeks prior. She was crushed thinking that after 7 months of planning it might all come to an end in an instance. Well she was able to finagle an appointment and getting to a specialist today (Friday). He gave her a cortisone shot and knee brace and said you are good to go no damage. Wohoo 2 thumbs up. We are a go!,,Massachusetts,"Apr 01, Fri",0
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526062,Got up early this am at Sharon's. We loaded the car and I clicked a picture of her leaving her house the last time before we head to Georgia. She said it's such a weird feeling to be leaving and won't be back for 6 months. She said driving her car one last time for six months was just as strange. Some of these things I had not even thought of until it happened. We just arrived in Tannersville and have unpacked all of our gear to spray it with Permethetin. This helps to prevent bugs and mostly ticks. We leave in less than 24 hours. Holy crap.,,Tannersville NY,"Apr 02, Sat",0
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526205,"Up and showered, dressed and ready to pack up the car. Wake to snow with whiteout conditions. What the heck no snow all winter and our biggest storm is in April? Luckily here in the Catskills the snow band moved through before I got out of the shower. Massachusetts is getting hit worse than here so I'm glad it was today and not yesterday while I was driving back to New York. The wind is very strong and should make for an interesting trip off the mountain top. But once we get down to the Hudson River all should be well. Gotta say goodbye to the two kitties (Will and Grace) and then to our pup Sandy. It's weird how your fur friends are such a major part of your life and not seeing them for 6 months will be so very hard. Saying goodbye will be even harder. We then will be headed south no later than 10 am is our goal. Will post where we end up for the night as we don't have any reservations we are just wingin it.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526561,"We made it to Georgia and to Amicalola State Park and Lodge. We had a quick lunch and then walked down the ""stairs"" to the visitor center to see Tom to officially sign in. I am hiker 1320 and Sharon is hiker 1321. It was a busy sign in day and they ran out of pages as we went to sign in. Tom was very apologetic which we were fine with it. We are in no rush as we were just absorbing the beautiful day. Such a strange feeling my legs were almost shaking. I will say it again ""I can't believe I am doing this"". Now the walk back up the stairs, will be good prep for tomorrow. We are starting tomorrow from the summit of Springer and are not doing the approach trail except for the portion along the falls.",,Springer Mt Summit,"Apr 05, Tue",0
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526799,"We begin!Sharon and I got driven up to the parking area on Springer Mt. We walked up to the summit with Jeff and his dad. Took a lot of pics and walked back to the parking area. Sharon geared up as I already had my pack on and we said our goodbyes. I gotta say that was one of the hardest things I have ever done. This is going to be just as hard on Jeff as it is me. He is the most wonderful person I know and his support in this is beyond me. We walked the 1.8 miles to the shelter and arrived at 4:30. Everyone said go slow hike short miles and take your time. So we are! We are gonna ease Sharon into big miles. The loft in the shelter was open so Sharon and I decided to jump for it. It was Sharon and I and 15 other guys. All very friendly. We met a man with a dog named olive. Three guys from Vermont and a man from British Columbia. Sharon made Mac and Cheese for her dinner and I ate a bunch of bagged nuts, fruit bars etc to get the loose food down. We crawled up into the loft at around 7 for relax time before bedtime around 8 or 9. We are shooting for Hawk Mt shelter tomorrow. This would give us a 5.4 mile day.","Springer Mt Summit
",Stover Creek,"Apr 06, Wed",2.80
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526848,We left Stover Creek and headed north. We continue our low mileage days so Sharon can acclimate. It's also helping me immensely with the slow pace. After the crazy thunderstorms last night with heavy rain we had the most beautiful day. Cool weather and sun with some wind made for a fantastic day of hiking. Sharon feels she's holding me back and going slow but in reality I go at my pace and stop to check to see where she is. After a bit there she is chugging up the hill so in reality I think she is doing amazingly well. We made it to Hawk Mt shelter at about 2:30 set up shop taking bottom level of the shelter. We have tents but with more rain possible why take the chance. So we are hunkering down for some sleep after our chores and dinner. Tomorrow is a big day for us with Sassafras and Justus Mt. More tomorrow if cell coverage allows. Forgot to mention we met the trail runner and maintainer Gus. He was a super chill guy and was very helpful in motivating Sharon.,"Stover Creek
",Hawk Mt Shelter,"Apr 07, Thu",5.30
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527000,"We left Hawk Mt shelter at around 9 and talk about a ton of ups and downs. Sassafras Mt and Justus Mt were a challenge especially after the 4 rather steep ups and downs. Sharon struggled but I had asked for some love on Facebook and people obliged. We were lucky enough to have a signal most of the time I could show her messages of support and love. It got her through. I switched off with using the walking stick and my poles. The walking stick were for the ups and the poles were for the downs. We named the walking stick ""smitty"" after my stepdad. So if you here about smitty in the future that is the walking stick. He passed from cancer in 1996 and I feel him close with me. When I randomly called the stick ""smitty"" it stuck. We arrived at Gooch shelter at 6:15 and did chores and dinner. We are passing out ASAP. Tomorrow the goal is woody gap and grab the shuttle at 5pm to the hostel for some R+R. Forgot to add in we met another ridge runner which was super nice again and told us a bunch of people already bailed by pushing to hard and to fast on the mileage end. Sharon felt good that she is still going. She met Phillip today who was having a hard time and when she caught up with me she had Phillip too and he was wearing her knee brace. Finally last thing to not around 8:30 the ridge runner came in and was scanning the log books looking for a hiker. Not sure why or what happened but remember to fill out the log books so you can be found if need be. Your last location will at least be known.","Hawk Mt Shelter
",Gooch Mt Shelter,"Apr 08, Fri",7.70
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527162,"What a night. Remind me not to have a cup of black coffee at 7pm to warm up. After our long 7.7 mile hike today I was beat by Gooch shelter. I pushed the last mile and made it to the shelter. The crew yelled storm where is trooper. (Sharon name from now on. We are storm-trooper.) I said she's struggling. They were ready to jump up and carry her up. I said I'm gonna drop my pack and head back down. I met up with her about .50 down the trail and took her pack up to Gooch. We were able to get a spot in the shelter ( thanks again). Set up made dinner and coffee. I was beat and we crashed. Then the coffee kicked in. At 12am I'm sitting looking at the stars listening to the wind. Then an owl or something similar hooted and others responded it was so cool. At 1am I was like oh come on, sleep why do you allude me. Then I crashed. The wind howled and the trees were swinging. Thank god no branches or trees came down and no one was hurt. By morning it was 34 and 40 mph winds. Gonna miss tune up as he was the man to make a fire. Every time we arrived at camp the fire was going. Hope to see him again. We packed up or tried. The word of the day was disheveled. We couldn't fit anything in our packs, or left pieces out. I was like what? it's not like we went shopping and I can't fit the new stuff in our suitcase. We kept laughing at the absurdity. We called the hiker hostel to inquire about the 5pm shuttle they said yea sure free shuttle but we are sold out booked to capacity. We were a bit down but called the wolf den country store that listed bunks for 20 bucks they said we have beds and shouldn't sold out. We were pumped. Then we were off. We met so many pups in the first mile. Lots of day hikers were out. Even though windy it was bluebird skies. So many pups were being walked. We met Emma, Toby, brownie and Sammy. Made me miss my sandy girl at home in New York. We finally met Dexter who's staying here with us at the hostel tonight. Sharon was sore after her tough hike yesterday but trooper was a trooper and kept keeping on. People are starting to call her super trooper on Facebook and emails. We summitted ramrock mountain. A day hiker gave us her two tangerines... Fresh fruit!!!!!! When we were packing up after our snack/ lunch a day hiker going southbound said there are hot dogs at woody gap! We ran, well I ran and Sharon hustled along. I got to the gap and said hello. Said thank you thank you, you all are amazing how long will you be set up. He said probably through tomorrow we are gonna camp out here. I said if I drop my pack will you watch it? They said sure and I ran back found Sharon and carried her pack again for her so she could have a break for the last .75 mile. We arrived at the gap and had hot dogs, cookies, chips, water. So Appreciated. Thanks to the three awesome guys at woody gap on Saturday April 9th. Sharon called the wolf den country store hoping they still had beds as it was supposed to be down to the 20's. They said yes we will send a shuttle. Woohoo hurray hurray. We got in and were able to do laundry, hot shower, resupply, and in the country store we got the biggest bacon, sausage pizza and split it. We are in a warm space with full tummies. Very content.! Goal tomorrow is to hike from woody gap to lance creek, acces how Sharon is feeling and probably tent there. Blood mountsin is coming and I want her to recover from the 7.7 from yesterday. We have met so many great people. The last two days we have met tuneup, little foot, timber and her dog Dexter, blondie, Dennis, Phillip and Cate. I hope Cate and the crew are ok tonight at lance creek campsite with the cold. They were pushing on from Gooch but didn't want to push Sharon that much. We will meet them again. One quick note about Cate. She is from Minnesotta and is thru hiking and is picking up trash while hiking as part of a trash pick up project. She has a grabber and ran around cleaning up each shelter location. A truly amazing girl. I hope we see her again.","Gooch Mt Shelter
",WolfPen Shelter,"Apr 09, Sat",5
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527352,"After a warm, warm, warm night in the hostel we got up and ready for the 9 am shuttle. Well we thought it was 9 but in reality it was 10. So we went into the wolf pen country store and had coffee. Gonna miss little foot, blondie and timber and Rex. Rex was such a good pup who was at the hostel last night. Made me miss sandy pup a bunch. We got to woody gap at 10:45 am. Same guys were doing trail magic and I thanked them again. We headed in and started up to preaching rock. It was a slow go for Sharon when we got to the ups especially with the rock scrambles they are hard for her. After reaching preaching rock we had big cedar mountain and more rock scrambles. Sharon did well and we made it to lance creek at about 2:30. I said do you wanna stay or push on trooper said push on... I think she regretted that decision. As there were more ups. I started having my first tough day on the physical end. Not sure if it was stopping and starting or doubling back just to make sure trooper was good. The last mile was tough and I felt famished. I'm eating like every 30 minutes. Trooper on the flip side at one point said she wanted to go home. I said we gotta get to Neels Gap before we can do anything and then you can think about it. Your not quiting on a bad day. We finally reached the sign for the shelter and were like hurray. Then we walked what seemed like a mile long blue blaze to the shelter. Finally made and no one I mean not a soul to be had was here. I gues we are the only bozos carrying a bear canister on a thru hike. I was gonna try and keep mine thru the smokies and then send it home. It was good having it because for trooper to do lance creek to neels gap would have bee really taxing on her. At least this way she only has 3.5 miles to go. We did chores, filtered water, ate food, food, food.. All with a cold wind blowing. We crawled into our bags at 8pm and are ready to zonk. I wanted to write this up first. Blood mountain tomorrow.","WolfPen Hostel
",Woods Hole Shelter ,"Apr 10, Sun",7.40
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527511,"I awoke at 4am in Woods hole shelter to Trooper whispering what is that noise? An owl I say! You sure trooper says? Well it's not the Georgia Devil. Needless to say Trooper slept with the head lamp on till daylight. I got up first to a very damp and heavy mist. We were in the clouds at 3700 feet. I gathered kindling and fired up the stove for coffee. We are packed and pushed off. Stopping on our way out to filter water on the blue blaze back to the AT. We had a short 3.5 day but it was not going to be easy. Up and over Blood Mt and down to Neels gap. We started slow and at the junction of Slaughter Creek trailhead I waited for Trooper to catch up. We saw our first hikers in almost 17 hours. Most people do not carry a bear canister with them just a food bag. You cannot camp or stay in a shelter between Lance Creek and Blood Mt without a bear canister. Everyone stayed at Lance Creek last night. It was good we had bear canisters or Trooper would of had to hike 11 miles from Lance Creek to Neels. We could have done 9 and stayed at Blood Mt shelter but it wasn't that nice. For a tidbit fact it was the first shelter built on the AT in 1932. So it was nice to see other hikers as we were alone last night at Woods Hole. We went slow any steady and arrived at the summit at 12:30 to pea soup fog. We rested at Blood Mt shelter, ate snacks/lunch, used the privy. I was signing the log book when suddenly it was like the mother alien ship moved off the mountain and we were drenched in sunshine and panoramic views... WOW! Talk about timing. Pictures were taken and we started our descent. Taking our time on the way down was much harder than the way up with lots of rocks. We took several breaks and arrived at Neels Gap at about 4pm. Trooper went in and bought some snacks and was looking for accommodations. She was under the impression we would be able to get into a motel or hotel. The word we were hearing from everyone along the trail was that Neels Gap was the emerald city. Our choices were the hostel, cabins, or a B+B which had a free shuttle from Neels and back to Neels. It sounded like it was out of someone's home. I called around to see if I could get a shuttle/taxi from Neels to either Blairsville or Dahlonga. Left 3 voicemails and finally one guy said he would do it for $75 dollars. No thank you! Trooper said ok let's just get a cabin and she called the number. We just sold out she was told! Ok I guess the hostel... We just sold out!!! Argh are you kidding. Trooper was about to have a meltdown.   Pretzel who was standing by had heard some of this and saw Troopers face and said I'll take you for 40 bucks in a few. Gotta finish up one thing. (He works at Neels Gap) shhhh he is not supposed to take people. We said sold... We were very thankful. It was about 20 miles to the holiday inn express, When he found out we were from the northeast he pulled in to Dunkin Donuts without even asking us. Our faces lit up big time.   Iced Coffee Wohoo!! We bought Pretzel a donut and he dropped us off. We paid him and thanked him immensely. He gave us his cell phone number in case we couldn't get back he would come after his dentist appointment. He thru hiked the AT in 2012.   We checked in and had a hot, hot, hot shower, ordered everything on the papa johns menu and relaxed. I went through my gear and took out about 5 pounds worth of stuff. I even went to the gym in the hotel to lift weights for my arms. Legs are good, arms don't get too much of a workout while hiking.   Now sleep time. Sharon booked a shuttle/taxi from the holiday inn back to Neels Gap which will be 45 dollars so Pretzel was right in line and he went way out of his way for us. Our plan is to go from Neels gap to Whitley Gap Shelter which would be a 7 mile day.","Woods Hole Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527677,We woke up at the Holiday Inn and had a fantastic nights sleep. We booked a shuttle back to Neels Gap and were on the trail by 10. Oh my god this day consisted of 12 ups and downs. The first 1/2 of the day was good and our spirits were high. The sun broke out and felt good on our skins but quickly turned into an energy draining yellow ball in the sky. We made it to Tesnatee Gap and saw the climb in front of us and wanted to give up. It was 565 feet in elevation gain in only .70 miles. I made it to the top end came back down to where Trooper was to carry her pack and we got her to the top. Ugh! We were spent. What a bitch of a climb for the end of the day. We made it to the junction of the blue blaze trail where the shelter was and it was 1.2 miles. We wanted to cry. We pushed and the trail dropped steeply to the shelter and we thought darn it we are gonna have to come back up this thing in the morning. Ugh. But we have to embrace the suck it will get better. Late addition this morning. I forgot to mention that I met Luigi and Knobbies yesterday. They both have trail journal so here. Ive been following them so it was nice to meet them in person.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527779,"The name says it all. We started the morning at Whitley Shelter and the climb up was to say at least not fun. When Trooper got up to the top she said well that was a hell hole and it stuck. The day was filtered sunshine and the wind died which made for pleasent hiking weather. We had three mountains to summit today. After our 1.2 miles out of Whitley we finally got back to the AT. That sucked, you walk 1.2 miles and it doesn't count for anything. We took our time to do the remaining 4.8 miles to low gap shelter. The scenery today was pretty lackluster but I did see a lot of neat flora. We made it to the shelter about 4:30. Trooper did a nice job today. Everytime I turned around she was right behind me. We got in the shelter again. We have not used our tents once yet. We set up shop and filtered water. We made dinner separately and I had chicken flavored Ramon, some of Sharon's pasta salad, 2 honey cups (from the holiday inn) and a snickers bar.   We now are hunkered down for the night at 7pm","Whitley Gap Shelter
",Low Gap Shelter,"Apr 13, Wed",4.80
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527994,"We started the day off early from Low Gap Shelter and got on the trail by 8am. The grade was so nice the first 4 miles. The trail was on an old road very similar to what we have back in the Catskill Park. The only difference is many of the old roads in the Catskill Park go up this one was flat and was a very easy grade. We were boogieing and had gone 4 miles before noon. We rested for a bit as we climbed up Blue Mt. We lept frogged Kate, Ompi, bubble head, no name and Hayden in some form or another. These were the group we spent most of the day with. Trooper was stiff and sore to start but the sun came out and she loosened up and was good to go. The climb up blue was steep but really rocky. This was our first real rocky climb on the AT. I said Trooper what does this remind you of and she said the Catskills. I felt like I was going up Westkill and not Blue Mountain. I got to Blue mt. shelter first and took off my bag, gaiters and unzipped my zip offs to make shorts it got pretty warm. I walked back to the trail junction to start going down the AT and there was trooper. Holy crap I said. I was coming down to help you and there you are good job. She was spent and beat tired. We walked over to Blue Mountain shelter and rested and ate snacks for about a 1/2 hour. We then debated on if we should stay in Hiawasse or Helen for the night as we needed resupply. My sister is in Georgia and is going to meet us on Friday. We decided on Helen as the hotel is closer for my sister and it had an indoor pool and hot tub. We called and made a reservation and began our steep 1.5 trek down Blue Mt dropping 1000 feet in elevation. We got to the bottom and were spent and were talking about ways to get to Helen. Do we hitch? Do we call a shuttle and then bam we crossed the street to trail magic. A group of past thru hikers 2010 had driven up from Athens GA and did trail magic since 8am. There were hot dogs, chips, soda, Gatorade, fruit, snacks and COLD BEER. Now I'm not a beer drinker but when I heard cold beer I was pumped. It was a nice surprise after a 10 mile hike in the sun. We sat in chairs that were provided and exchanged stories. Tumbleweed and company were wonderful. We called for a shuttle from a number the hotel provided. Trooper called and the guy who answered said he was sick. That's so our luck... Our shuttle guy is sick we laughed. I then said I guess trooper I'll stick you on the side of the road and pray someone picks us up. Just then tumbleweed says we all have 5 cars here one of us can give you a lift. We were overjoyed at the offering and said yes please. So we piled into the back of tumbleweeds car and Max her boyfriend and she drove us to Helen. She said that she had gotten a ton of free rides and trail magic that it was time to pay it forward. They dropped us off at the hotel and we checked in. We dropped all of our gear in the room, pulled all our clothes into one pile and did a wash. I had my pair of running shorts which I threw on and went in the hot tub to soak my legs. When I got back into the room I heard Trooper on the phone with her husband. I heard her say the words I'm coming home. She said goodnight to him and hung up. I looked at her and said its that time? She said yes it is! She said the trail is so hard and I'm in so much pain. In the coarse of 52.9 miles I have watched the pain on Troopers face but she pushed through it. Finally it was just too much for her.?So trooper will not be joining me back on the trail at Unicio Gap. She had said 6 times prior, I wanna go home and I would have her read the list of why she wanted to do the AT. If she had done all on her list then it was time to go home. The last time we stayed overnight at the Holiday Inn I thought she might not return to the trail but she did for another 16 miles. She is sad to leave and loved every minute but her body just is not liking it. Watching her grow over the last 9 days has truly been remarkable. From her first steps of panicked looking where do I put my foot, to me turning around to see how far back she is and she is right at my heels. Trooper was not a hiker or outdoors person before she did this. All of her outdoor experience has been with me and most of that has been since November 2015 when her and I started training for this. I'm going to miss her out on the trail and all the times we have laughed but I know she is still right there with me. She helped me get my trail legs, she helped me keep a slow pace and low miles and she helped me get smitty 52.9 miles closer to Maine. I think her 52.9 mile journey has been a success and has forever changed her. So to my super trooper thank you for the memories. Come visit me when I get to Virginia.","Low Gap Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528088,"So this day was full of emotions. First we woke at the hotel and I went in the pool and hot tub again. Trooper spent most of the time after we had breakfast setting up to have a shuttle/taxi pick her up and bring her to Atlanta. When she found a driver she had an hour to book the flight and pack before he arrived. We both packed and walked down to the lobby to check out together. We both sat on rocking chairs. Her ride arrived and I put her pack in the back of the van we hugged shed some tears and she was off. 20 minutes later my sister arrived from Ellijay with the whole clan. We had lunch at Big Daddies, my sister brought me resupplies so I repacked my gear in the parking lot. Then went to post office to mail stuff home and mail stuff forward. We then stopped at a gas station so I could buy a bunch of snacks. My sister then drove me to Unicio Gap to hop back on the trail. We said goodbye again tears and I was on my way. Tumbleweed and Max and the crew were back at it with trail magic. She gave Trooper and I a ride into town the day before. I grabbed a Gatorade and chugged it, thanked them again for everything and started up Rocky Top mountain over 1000 foot climb out of the gap. I was thinking about Jeff, boy do I miss him and today was his birthday. After being together for 19 years this was his first birthday we weren't together for. Ugh!! I kept pausing and turning to look for Trooper but she wasn't there. This was turning into my first emotional day and I'm sure more to come. I summitted Rocky Top and then dropped 950 feet down to Indian Grave Gap and then back up 1345 feet to summit Tray Mt. Arrived at Tray Mt shelter, was able to get in the shelter. I was way too tired to set up my tent. I made dinner and ate and now relaxing... Tomorrow I'm not sure where I'm headed.. 7 miles to the next shelter, 11 miles to a hostel or 15 miles to the next next shelter. We shall see what I can do comfortably in one full day solo.","Unicio Gap/ Helen GA

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528241,"Woke up early in Tray Mt shelter. Made breakfast and hit the trail before 7:30. Saw the kitty that is hiking with a couple. It makes me laugh. Poor kitty must be tired each day. Made it to deep gap by 11:30 and completed 7.4 miles. I boogied right along. Didn't see anyone except one man who was packing up his camp. I said good morning and he was running around yelling I'm late I'm late. All I could think of was the white rabbit in Alice in Wonderland. I was laughing inside and never found out if he was headed north or south. Stopped at Deep Gap shelter and only one hiker there who was taking a zero at the shelter. He was nice and read while I ate my lunch. Left the shelter and stopped on my way out to filter water as I was getting low. I went up and over Young Lick Knob and Kelly Knob. Kelly Knob was quite the climb at 4126. My pack felt like someone had put a cinder blocks in it by the time I got to the top. Met another hiker who I think is called Chris. We kept flip flopping each other the last 3 miles and finally arrived together at Dicks Creek Gap at about 2. We started walking the road back to T.O.P (top of Georgia hostel) when the shuttle pulled over to pick us up. We were thrilled even though it was only a .50 mile walk it felt like 10 miles. We checked into the hostel and this place is known for being the best hostel along the AT. They gave us a free cold soda and gave us a tour of the facilities. The check in place is in a great room with three large tables and benches, two large couches, flat screen tv. They have a kitchen area for staff which has coffee on all day, snacks and you can purchase pizza and other food. They also have a private bath in the common room with a shower. The big bunkhouse has a kitchen, stove, microwave, sink and a private bath. The big bunk house area has 18 beds. Then the wolf den is for guests with dogs. I got put with all the pups and was in heaven. I took a shower and relaxed. They have a front porch and a back porch with rockers and benches. So nice. They serve breakfast for free (included in price) is offered in the morning and they run a shuttle to the gap every 1/2 hour. It's going to be a nice night here. I'm excited that a whole bunch of familiar faces are here tonight. Little-foot, Luigi, Ompi, Kate, noodles, the librarian and a bunch of other familiar faces are here. Trooper and I met them all on our first 10 days. Tomorrow the plan is to get back to Dick's Creek Gap in the morning and shooting for Muskrat Creek Shelter. That would give me an 11.8! Mile day.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528503,"Day 12: We woke up at Top of Georgia Hostel. Bob and his staff were amazing and every thru hiker should stay here. He did a talk at 8:30 about tips to successfully thru hiking. It was really good. We were offered free coffee/tea and homemade muffins in the morning. They were yummy. I took the 8:30 shuttle to Dick's Gap. It was nice to be with the crew again last night. They really are a great group of people. I boogied again today and made it to plum orchard shelter at a about 11:00 and guess who was there. Timber and Dexter... Yay!!! I haven't seen them since Sucches. I had an early lunch and dried out my feet. Then filtered some water and jumped back on the trail. Then we climbed and boy did we climb. Finally reached the GA/NC border took some pictures and made it to Bly gap. Had to filter water again and stopped at the funky tree and took a picture. Then North Carolina showed what she's made up with a steep horrendous climb over a knob. Welcome to North Carolina! Ugh. Then another and then another. Finally arriving to the shelter at about 4pm. I practically crawled on my hands and knees to get up the last knob. At the shelter I set up my pad and bag. I was so spent I was so not looking forward to setting up a tent. So I still have yet to be in my tent. Once summer comes I'm sure I'll be in it more often. I walked up to Raven Cliffs and there was an old plane crash. The cliffs offered a fantastic view. Got back to the shelter and ate cold dinner as I didn't wanna cook. The rest of the crew from the hostel are here... Luigi, Tranquility, Timber, Ompi, and Tune up from Gooch shelter. It's nice to be with all the people I have met from the beginning.","T.O.G.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528625,"Woke up at 7am at Muskrat Creek Shelter. Made breakfast and packed up and hit the trail. I was the first one out. The crew left sometime after me. The morning was bluebird skies again and not a cloud to be seen. The weather has been perfect and no rain. Knock on wood that it stays. The trail was good to us today. She gave us a gift after yesterday's horrendous climbs. One slight climb and then a steady downhill to low gap. I shedded all of my layers at low gap to begin the climb up Standing Indian Mt. The climb followed an old road and very much resembled a climb up Hunter Mt in the Catskills following the old road out of Spructon Valley. Made for an easy climb and I reached the summit at just about 12. No really good views from the summit but you could see nice views through the leaf less trees. The summit stands at 5435 feet. The climb down from Standing Indian was awesome. Bright sunshine and temps in the 80's it was almost hot. I was just in my running shorts still ahead of the pack. The temp increased as I dropped lower in elevation. The trail was through a tunnel of Rhodendron in an archway. Suddenly a stream popped out of nowhere with a huge pool of cold water. I was in heaven and soaked my head and soaked a bandanna which I wrapped around my head. I continued on my way with just one more climb to end out the day. I arrived to the shelter at 3:15 and was the first person there out of the group from camp. I set up my tent, filtered water, and got organized and soaked in the sun. The crew started filtering in at about 4:15 so I guess I was about an hour ahead of them. I cooked dinner and ate, then relaxed around the fire. Went to bed about 9:30. Tomorrow we have several big climbs including Albert Mt where the 100 mile mark is. Holy crap I've almost walked 100 miles. We all are shooting to get to rock gap and get a ride into town.

I was just about ready to go when the rest of the crew started waking up. I said see you all this afternoon and was off. Well between camp and 15 minutes later down the trail I must of stepped in dog poop, animal poop or quite possibly human poop. How did I discover this, well I looked down and at the bottom of both pant legs on the inside there be ""poop"" Well I laughed cause what else are you gonna do in the middle of the woods. I hiked on. Apparently I broke trail because for the first 4 miles I was covered in cow webs from head to toe. Your welcome all behind me!! I stopped for a snack at about mile 4 and unzipped off my pants and pulled them inside out and tucked them in my bag. I hiked on. Stopping to filter water at Betty's Creek. I arrived at Mooney Gap and met another hiker Chris who just got back from a tour in the Middle East in the army. He arrived just as I was to trail magic by Rodney who was just setting up. He had coffee, OJ, bananas, oranges, pineapple, cookies... I was so surprised as I didn't even know there was a dirt road there. He was awesome and had time today as all he had to do was dismantle a piano. What?!?? Lol!! He said he has two pianos in his house and no one plays it so he was gonna dismantle one. I thanked Rodney took a picture and moved on. The trail than followed a cliff with great views between the bushes. I was kinda glad the bushes were there as it was a woooooaash moment. That was for about a mile. Then in the distance you could see Albert Mt. with the fire tower in top. So cool to see. The climb up was very similar to something you would see in the White Mountains. Bedrock ledge scrambles. When I arrived at the top I took pictures and the fire tower was the 100 mile mark... Woooooooooo. I hiked on after having my lunch on the summit. I stopped at long branch shelter and Rock gap shelter on the way and even with the stops I arrived at Rock Gap at 2:30. Did 12.2 miles in about 6 hours. I was pumped.. Now just had to wait till 6 for our ride into town. We all were supposed to split a room at the Hampton Inn. I was waiting for someone from the crew to catch up and Keg Leg showed. I asked her if she has anyone's number and she said her phone was dead. Well we waited and Kid and his dad showed up and another guy. We all sat and someone said hey there is one more shuttle at 3:45.   So when it showed I wrote a note and stuck it to the trash barrel. Jumped on the shuttle and headed into town. Got here and tried to get a room at Havens Budget Inn but they were sold out. So I grabbed a bunk in the bunk house. Did my laundry. Was sitting on a plastic chair in the parking lot in just rain pants, flip flops and no shirt watching the traffic go by. That's an image. Laundry finished, jumped in the shower then went and grabbed food at Hardee's and an Iced Coffee from Mcd's and resupply at Dollar General. Got back to the bunk house and now relaxing. Miles came in another bunk mate and he said he got a ride at 6pm from Rock Gap. I asked him if he saw a dog Dexter, Timber, Luigi. He said yes they got the same ride and got my note on the trash barrel. Excellent! I didn't want them to think I ditched them, but hike your own hike. Bed soon. The plan tomorrow is to get up early, pack up grab breakfast nearby and get to the post office when they open to get my three packages.

After breakfast I headed back to the bunkhouse grabbed my gear and walked to the post office to pick up my 3 packages. I had to stuff it all in and boogie back for the free shuttle. Jumped on the shuttle and got dropped off at Rock Gap. I dumped everything out and repackaged it and realized shit I have so much weight in my pack. I didn't realize Jeff had sent some of the things I had bought last night. I began the days hike and felt pretty good till I got to the ups. My feet instantly responded to the weight and were sore. I kicked off my boots and bandaged up my feet and duct taped them. I hiked on. Climbing out of winding stair gap I came across Little-foot who I had heard was sick. She said she thinks she had heat exhaustion and was taking it easy. I carried on and suffered up the climb to 5010 feet. I stopped a bit from the top to have lunch. After lunch I came across a blue blaze to the top of the bald I was climbing. I dropped my pack and hiked up in the blazing sun. The view was phenomenal. I carried on cringing at my feet. I got to the fire tower for another fantastic view. I finally arrived at the shelter to full full.. Not a lot of places to camp normally so I'm set up on a hill. Hopefully I don't role downhill in the middle of the night. I did 14.7 miles today, my biggest day yet. I'm beat and gonna crash.

Got up packed up and got on the trail at 9. My feet hurt before I even started so I taped them, and put on 2 pairs of socks for added padding. I took my time as the climbing was not terrible but it was up. At the first shelter I came across I stopped and had s snack. Then continued on for more slow walking. I'm not sure if I have blisters under the skin, or bruised bottoms of my feet or what. All I know is each step was pain. At Tellico Gap I stooped for lunch and took off my boots and socks to let everything dry. I had one more big climb of the day then it was all downhill to the NOC. At the top of the last climb was a tower with an observation deck. Granted there were clouds at this point but still great views and great pics. I continued on the climb downward. Taking my time to go the miles. When I arrived at the Morgan Shelter I had not realized I missed the shelter I really was going to stay at.  I had just walked 15.5 miles my longest day yet.

Got on the trail by 7:30 so I could get into the N.O.C. before they opened up. Made the easy mile walk on super sore feet. Luckily I did this in between rain and I have still yet walked in the rain. I got to the outdoor center by 8:15 and dropped my gear off outside the restaurant. Went in and had the best breakfast ever. While inside at breakfast I tried to book a room on the N.O.C. website. They had nothing available for Friday night but did have a room for 2 in the bunkhouse for Saturday so I grabbed it. After breakfast I sat and relaxed outside on the benches outside the restaurant under the pavilion. I called the reservation line at 9 just to confirm that there was nothing available or any cancellations. She told me the only thing they had available was a cabin for 549.99 which I said ""NO THANK YOU"". At this point the outfitter was open and I decided to wander around. I scored body glide and wet wipes in the hiker box. I bought a few post cards and mailed them and signed the log book. When the general store opened at 10 I walked over and bought a drink and went back and sat on the bench by the restaurant. My best friend David and his family had left Disney World that morning and were planning on stoping to visit on their way back to Massachusets. They said they would take me into town to a motel when they got here at 6. So I plugged my phone in to charge and decided to relax. I googled places to stay and the Nantahala Lodge which showed a mile down the road. I called the number and Cindy answered saying yes they did have rooms available. She said they are only a mile west. I started walking in the rain and she called me back to say her husband was at the NOC and he would give me a ride. I turned around and found Chad and he brought me down to the motel. It was in a great location and very neat and clean. I got there about 10:45 and unpacked all my gear. I took a bath and just lounged for the rest of the day. I jumped on a conference call at 5 for the Catskill regional chairs meeting which I am a volunteer for and was actually in a position to call in. David and his family arrived at 6:30 and I was so excited to see them. We hung for a bit in the room and then drove into Bryson City to get dinner. They drove me back to the motel and we said our goodbyes. I got inside and was in bed by 9:30. I rested my feet and they are feeling better. It appears I have two blisters under the skin deep and not on the surface. The plan tomorrow is to get dropped off at the NOC and take a zero and let them heal further. I won't make it to Maine without good feet. Luigi texted me yesterday to ask if I was hiking in this Monsoon of rain. I lucked out that I got into the NOC before it poured and boy did it pour. She was held up in her tent and the rest of the crew has taken another day off. They should of been dropped back off at Rock gap. I told Luigi if she could get to the NOC she could split the room with me. I have two beds and only need 1. She said she is gonna push to do 15 miles on Saturday to get to the NOC.

When I arrived at the NOC I stopped at the river view restaurant to get breakfast. Afterwards I headed over to the outfitter to print my Smokey Mountain permit. While I was there I looked at insoles for my boots to see if they would help with my feet. After trying on a pair I was sold my feet felt fantastic. I had about three hours to kill while waiting to check in so I wandered the campus exploring it. At 2 I was able to check into my room or should I say closet. Lol. Hey I was happy. There was a bed and a lofted bed, fan and a air conditioning unit in the wall and the door locked and you needed a key card to get in. I left my gear and walked down to the water relaxing my feet and putting them in the very cold river water. Around 3 I headed back to base camp as they call it here and took a nap. Around 4 I got up and headed back over to the general store when Luigi texted me she could see the NOCthrough the trees. She popped out of the woods around 4:30 and we were gonna split the room cause I had a whole other bed I wasn't gonna be using. We dropped of her stuff then went and ate dinner and did our laundry. We were offered beer by a couple of thru hikers who had bought a case. We thanked them and took one and drank beer while waiting for the laundry to finish. Once we got the laundry done I took a hot shower and am about to crash. Back on trail bright and early tomorrow. Fontana Dam is in my sight and then onto the smokey mountsins.

Then went to the general store as I needed snacks. We got on trail at about 11:40. The climb was not as bad as I originally thought it was going to be. We went 4 miles slowly. My hips were killing me as my body got used to not carrying a backpack the last two days. As for my feet the right one is ok and back to normal. The insoles are awesome and are very helpful. As for my left foot the deep blister has surfaced and though it doesn't hurt the puffy fluid part is heading north toward my toes. I haven't pooped it and really don't want to. Will see how it does in the morning. The last mile to the shelter was rough and straight up. 800 feet in about a mile in elevation gain. There were fantastic views down to the NOC and we had bluebird skies again. We arrived at camp at 5 and set up our tents. Then we filtered water and made dinner. Now we are relaxing by the fire.

Filtered more water, packed up and packed the tent.   Started making my breakfast when Luigi came down to join me. We talked about our plan for the day. Ompi, the royal couple and Sarah headed out and said goodbye. I finished up with my breakfast and headed out. Luigi said she sound be along. The first thing of the morning was a climb up a bald to 5080 feet. Cheopac Bald I believe was the name. I burned that page from the guide book so I'm not sure anymore. There was a great view from the top. I took a break and the started down the big descent. I used my trekking poles and smitty (the walking stick) was in my pack. The way down had a lot of low branches and smitty kept getting tied up. I learned to go backwards to avoid being tangled up. A group of senior guys were doing a hike and asked me what the walking stick was for. I told them and they each thanked me and shook my hand. I continued on and came across a bunch of flowers and took pictures. Suddenly I looked up and there was Luigi. That girl moves especially on the downhill. We stopped at a gap to eat a snack and rest our feet. T-mobile showed up. This isn't his trail name it's just what the crew calls him. He is always on his phone and claims he is CIA or something. We've overheard all very strange conversations. Some of us don't even think there is anyone on the other end of the head phones. He is nice enough to me so I don't worry to much about it. We had one last climb and then a good descent to another gap with a major road across it. Luigi and I just missed trail magic but the rest of the crew were there. Ompi, Sarah, the royal couple, inferno, trail name, t-mobile. A group of about 25 of us. We ate lunch and I was the first to kick off. I don't like sitting around too long. I lose my energy and then don't want to start walking again. The next climb we had was Jacobs ladder. Now this wasn't the biggest elevation of the day but it was straight up lose dirt in a single line. It really felt like you were climbing a ladder. I was spent. My pack is still to heavy. Can't wait to get to Fontana Dam as I am sending a whole bunch of stuff home. I took my time and gave myself goals to get to, that tree, that log etc. Once on top we rested then followed the ridge line for a bit and the descended to brown fork gap shelter.   We stopped to use the privy, filter water and air out our feet. Luigi and I then pushed on. At the top of the trail from the shelter we came across little-foot who was sitting with two others. We said hi and continued to move on. We had a few more ups and downs but nothing too terrible. My feet at this point are doing ok. My right foot is fantastic and the insoles are awesome. My left foot is kinda doing so, so. The insoles are helping but the deep blister came to the surface. Now it doesn't feel sore or anything and I did not pop it. So while I'm walking the bubble of fluid is moving up my foot and by the end of the day was between my toes. Now it doesn't hurt but it just feels so damn funny. We came to the camping area we were gonna stop at which would of been 12 miles or so. We saw the Royal couple and told them we were gonna continue on. We said tell Ompi as we are gonna share a room in Fontana Dam and don't want him to think we ditched him. We pushed on and we came across a bunch of pink lady slippers. I was so excited to see them in the wild. No white ones just pink. I took pictures of them. After pushing we finally arrived at cable gap shelter at about 7. A late night for us so we rushed to set up our tents and filter water. Where we pushed on doing 15 miles today we caught up to the next group. The plant lady was here, as well as chef, Mark and Matt as well as a few others who stayed at the same shelter we were at last night. We made dinner and hung out bear bags.

Her and I have been comparing plant pictures from the first 167 miles. I've been identifying the ones she doesn't know through Leslie and Brenda from Lowes. I pushed off at about 8 onto the trail. We only had one big climb today up to black gum gap. The hill did not have a name but it was about 600 foot climb. Once to the summit I had cell service again and could update my journals. Then all we had was the climb down to Fontana. We arrived at the marina at about noon. They had a soda machine and I bought, well attempted to buy a soda. All were sold out except for Diet Coke, which was fine I do drink diet. All that mattered to me was it was cold. We hiked on from the marina 1.2 miles to the Fontana Hilton.   Which is a shelter on the trail which holds 20 people and has a shower and bathrooms nearby with running water. We set up our tents on the pads nearby and got the shuttle into town. I stopped at the post office and picked up my package from Chris Lovell in Massachusetts. Then Luigi and I did our laundry and resupplied at the general store. Afterwards a bunch of us walked down to the gas station where they had chili dogs and nachos. We gorged ourselves. We then proceeded to take the shuttle back to the Fontana Hilton where we organized our food bags for our 5 day trek into the Smokies.

Luigi charged her phone. I had a cold soda. Cherry flavor coke.!! First soda in months. The main group took off and we wandered looking around the visitor center.   Around 10 Luigi and I shoved off and crossed the dam taking pictures. Fontana Dam was so cool to cross over. After seeing it in movies and hearing about it from trail stories to be there was a milestone in my book. We went a mile and got to the drop box and filed out our permits and dropped them in. We both had a snack and I pushed off before Luigi. She was going to listen to podcasts and wanted to eat some more food. Our packs are heavy as we are planning on going straight through the smokies and not going to Gatlinburg for resupply. We have 6 days of food. I met up with Luigi and the Royal couple caught up with me just below the blue blaze to the a fire tower. I had gone up to the fire tower and took pictures. I was only able to go up 1/2 way as the heights got to me. I took pictures and went back down to have lunch. The gang caught up and went up the side trail to check out the tower. I finished and pushed on while the 3 had their lunch. The trail in the smokies is remarkably nicer than further south. I don't know if it's because it's not a heavily used but the trail in the smokies seems more user friendly. It doesn't go straight up and down and a more enjoyable trail to walk. I arrived at the birch camp area and filtered water and pooped in the woods for the first time this trip. Yay me!! Ha ha. Moved on and the day got hot and humid. I went about an hour and checked radar and saw a rain shower headed toward me. I put all my gear on and it poured for 4 minutes and then was like just kidding.   I laughed. This was my first time in 22 days walking in the rain and it only lasted 4 minutes. At this point I'm not sure what state we are in. We are walking the border. I did not see any signs saying we are in Tennessee so I'm still stating I'm in North Carolina. The last .50 miles to the shelter was rough. A steep climb in a straight line. Got to the shelter and most people had hiked on another 3 miles to the next shelter. I didn't have the energy to. Luigi and the Royal couple showed and we cooked and made diner. Ompi and the others are 3 miles further north. They started earlier so had more daylight. Three section hikers are here and are very friendly. We are about to crash. We all will be sleeping in the shelters through the smokies as its required.","Fontana Hilton

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530431,"Day 23: Boy did it pour last night. I'm glad I didn't have to pack up a wet tent. We all woke up around 7:30 packed up and ate breakfast. When you don't have a tent to put away that process goes much better. There is no cell service at the shelter tonight so I will post this as soon as I can. We got on trail about 8:30. It was Luigi, myself and the Royal couple. The layout of the trail here in the Smokies is laid out amazingly well. It's actually enjoyable to walk it. I stopped 3 miles in at Russell Field Shelter and had my second breakfast. After breakfast we had a gradual climb up to Spencer Field Shelter where I filtered water and had a snack. I had about 6 miles in and began the climb up Thunderhead Mountain. The views at the top were spectacular. I must say the weather has been fantastic. (Knock on wood). I've only had to walk in the rain for 4 minutes my whole trip so far. I caught up to Luigi on the summit as her and the Royal couple had passed me while I was filtering water at Spencer Field.   We met up with the Royal couple a mile down from the summit where they were filtering water at the stream. They are going into Gatlinburg on Saturday to stay overnight. Luigi and I are debating if we should go in for pancakes, take a shower at the NOC there and do laundry and then get a ride back to Newfound Gap and hike the 3 miles to Icewater Spring Shelter. We are thinking that's what we will do. I moved on from our snack and we only had 3 miles to go. It was the longest and toughest 3 miles of the trip. My energy got zapped from the sun, big climbs already and the 3 more climbs we had I was practically crawling. When I got to the shelter I collapsed and actually fell asleep for 20 minutes.   When I woke up everyone was in a holding pattern. There were 7 people set up in the shelter and the ridge runner was there saying that 5 more people had a reservation. We couldn't set up tents until they showed. We all made dinner, filtered water. At 7pm she said ok I need 5 people to volunteer to go into the shelter to fill it to 12 and then the rest can tent. I volunteered, the Royal couple did and 2 others did. Luigi was able to set up her tent. Let's just hope these people don't show in the middle of the night. I'm spent. No cell coverage so no idea if Jeff made it to Seattle. Tomorrow we have Clingmans Dome which is 10 miles from here. Bed soon big day tomorrow.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530601,"Day 24: The shelter all woke up at around 7:15. I apparently was snoring in the shelter last night.. Whoops. I packed up from the shelter, filtered water, and made breakfast. I got on trail by 8:30. We had to climb up and over Cold Spring Knob, Silers Bald, Mt. Buckley and then onto Clingmans Dome. On my first climb I came across two turkeys fighting it out with their feathers flared. It was fun to watch until they started running towards me. I then had to climb Silers Bald where I stopped for a snack. I carried on and at the top of Silers Bald you could see Clingmans Dome. The weather again today was fantastic, blue skies again. It's been a great run with the weather and we will see if this continues. After going 2 miles from Silers Bald I came up to Double Spring Gap Shelter where I stopped for lunch. There were two springs at this shelter. One was in North Carolina and the other was in Tennessee. The trail at this point follows directly the state line. After leaving Double Springs Shelter I came into a spruce forest. This was my first on the AT and it was most likely due to the increase in elevation. I got up onto the ridge and followed it the whole way to Clingmans Dome. There were many vistas along the way which made for a very nice hike. I came across a couple who were out birding and they were just fascinated about my journey. I told 5 other day hikers about the walking stick when they inquired about it. Finally I got to the side trail which went to the summit. It brought you out to a paved walkway which brings you up a spiral to an observation tower. Fantastic views from the top. The ranger at the bottom asked me if I was a thru hiker. I said yes and he tossed me a bag of Oreos. He said go ahead and leave your pack here while you go up to the summit. Got some great shots at the top. I headed back down and thanked the ranger for the cookies and got back to where the connector trail for the AT is. I say in the grass for about 20 minutes and Luigi popped out of the woods. She decided to rest and wait for the Royal couple. This gave me a chance to run the 1/2 mile down the trail to the parking area and to see what snacks the gift shop had. The gift shop only had bottle water and there was no place to charge your phone. So I walked the 1/2 mile up the big hill back to the group. They were disappointed like me that there wasn't anything good in the gift shop. We mushed on. The trail dropped down off the mountain at a decent grade. We then got to the gap where the climb for Mt Collins would begin. At this point we had gone 12 miles for the day and I was pretty spent. I ate a protein bar and Luigi and I pushed up the mountain. We made it to the top and started coming down the other side. We got to the sign that read Collins Shelter .50 miles off trail. Ugh are you kidding. We tromped on. Finally reaching the shelter which was full. It was a Friday night and we got a good tenting spot. Hopefully there is no rain tonight. I have not been able to check the weather due to poor service so I'm going in blind. Our plan is to get out of camp by 7am tomorrow. We want to get to Newfound Gap to catch the shuttle into town. Also to note I surpassed the 200 mile mark today.","Derick's Knob Sheltet

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530682,"I woke up early today, 5am! Quietly packed up my gear and tent. Wrote in my paper journal a bit and read the guidebook. I got our food bags from the bear cables and wished I had a can of WD-40 as the line squeeked so bad I thought I was gonna wake up the whole camp. At 6:15 I whispered into Luigi's tent its ""Pancake Time""! She has wanted chocolate chip pancakes for about a week now. I pushed off about 7am and Luigi wasn't too far behind me. The trail this morning was a nice downhill grade. It followed for awhile the road going up to Clingmans Dome and you could hear the traffic through the woods. We arrived at the only climb of the day which was Mingus Ridge. The trail was laid out in such a way that you hardly felt like you were ckimbing. This section had 2 wild hog containment bridges with a fenced in area which was to protect a group of native beech trees that have been devastated by the wild hog that's not native to the area. It was introduced in the 1950's and has decimated the new beech saplings. Kind of a neat structure. We came down the other side of the ridge and came into New Found Gap. It was kind of an emotional moment for me as this was a section of the trail or place I had been to about ten years ago. I remember the vacation Jeff and I took where we just rented a car and headed south and ended up in the Smokies. We did a hike near New Found Gap and I remember standing by the Appalachian Trail sign looking down the trail thinking of how amazing it would be to do and now here I am in the very same spot doing it ten years later. Very cool feeling, I won't lie and say tears welled up. We came across trail magic which was just setting up, chips, soda and ham sandwiches. We were able to get a ride back into Gatlinburg from a woman who was dropping of a resupply for a woman. It was 5 bucks a person to ride the 15 miles into Gatlinburg. Sold! The plan for Luigi and I was laundry, shower, resupply, pancakes at the Pancake Parlor and the get dropped back off at New Found Gap back onto the trail. We got dropped off at the Nantahalan Outdoor Cebter, the same NOC company that I stayed at a week earlier. This is an outpost location. They offer free pack watch as well as free showers. We dropped off our packs and walked down the street to do our laundry. We changed into our rain gear and did our laundry while charging our phones. Next door was a Mexican restaurant which also had a grocer with super cheap prices. We supplied up and saved a ton. Score! We then walked back to the NOC for our free shower. They told us there is no hot water just so you know, we were like that's fine with us. It was the best COLD shower I've ever had. I got dressed and met Luigi back upstairs and we shopped in the NOC for the remaining supplies. I needed boot laces, body glide and some lunch items and a few power bars. Once that was all complete we hiked back down the road to the Pancake Parlor. We opened the door and walked in. The man at the register said I'm sorry we are closed at 3. We looked at our watches and it was 3:15. The look on Luigi's face as she has been craving chocolate chip pancakes for two weeks and has not been able to obtain them for one reason or another. She said ""that's it, we are staying overnight"" so we walked to the Grand Prix and got a room for 23 bucks a person. We then went to Texas Road house for dinner and the Royal Couple walked in so we ate together. Tomorrow the plan is PANCAKES through hell or high water and then hitch hike back up to New Found Gap to get back on the trail.","Mt Collins Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530940,"Day 26: We stayed overnight at the Grand Prix motel. The main reason for the stay was due to not being able to get our chocolate chip pancakes. We got up at 8 and went with the Royal couple to the Pancake Pantry. The Royal couple had bad news for us. Sarah (Scavengar) told us her grandad is very ill and is dying. She needs to get off trail and fly home back to the U.K. Simon (honey buns) is staying here and Sarah will meet back up with him later on.   They are staying again tonight in Gatlinburg and Sarah will get transport to Knoxville and will be flying from there to Chicago and then to London. I'm gonna miss them terribly as they are great people. I told Simon when he gets back on trail on Monday to try and catch us. Breakfast was good but very expensive. They seem to charge for everything separate. If you order specialty pancakes for 9.95 that's all you get, no hash browns, eggs etc. It was an expensive breakfast but good. The other odd thing is they only take cash, no credit or debit cards. Odd for this day and age but it didn't hurt their business. They still had a line down the street when we left. We walked back down the street and I stopped to get an iced coffee from Starbucks while Luigi stopped into Walgreens. We checked out of the motel and walked back towards the NOC. I ran in to buy a new spork as mine broke and I bought titanium this time and not plastic. We then said ok let's try and hitch back to New Found Gap. It was my first time doing it ever in my life. After only 10 minutes Bryce pulled over and gave us a lift and drove us the 15 miles to New Found Gap. We were most thankful and got on trail by noon. I have to say this section of the AT between New Found Gap sand Pecks Shelter is by far my favorite. The climb was steady up today. I should mention Luigi and I hike similar paces but most days we hike separate and meet up when the other stops. We occasionally hike together and talk but often it's our solo time to listen to music, podcasts or most recently for me I've meditated while hiking. I came to a view point and there were 2 day hikers a few minutes in front of me and they said when they got to the clearing there was a bear cub that had run into the woods. I moved on and stopped at Icewater Spring Shelter and signed the log book. I left a note to Mr Honey Buns (Simon) and said catch me if you can. I moved on and then got to the side trail for Charlie's Bunion. I dropped my pack and Smitty and took my hiking poles. I was gonna combat my fear of heights. It was spectacular and had a few moments of Woah!! I took many panoramas. Luigi showed up next and had checked out the views. Next thing I knew Chloe the ridge runner was there asking who had left their packs unattended. We were like they are ours. She scolded us saying you can't leave your bags unattended as there has been a heavy bear presence on this section of the trail and they will get your food. We were like ooooops sorry, sorry. She was nice but was doing what she is supposed to. We ran back to our packs and moved on. Now the next 6 miles of the trail was simply amazing. The trail followed a ridge line, sometimes along a cliff, sometimes almost knife edge like. There were vistas after vistas and I said WOW almost 50 times. The visibility wasn't perfect but it still was pretty spectacular. I took many pictures. I arrived at the shelter at about 5:15. I was able to get a spot and save one for Luigi. I filtered water, did my chores had dinner and hunkered down for bed by 7:30. Tomorrow we are planning on going 12.6 to Cosby Knob shelter and we will only be about 12 miles away from being out of the park.","Grand Prix Motel

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531114,"Day 27: I actually slept in today and woke up at 7. Made breakfast packed up my stuff and got on trail at about 8.   I had a .40 mile climb up and out of the shelter which was down in a hole. Finally getting on trail I stopped at Eagle Rocks took some pictures and moved on. The big climb of the day was Mt. Guyot which was the last tall mountain in Smokey Mountain National Park at 6302 feet. The climb was steady but manageable. Once up the trail followed a ridge line which made for easy walking. There were several great view points where I got some fantastic pictures. Then I had a long downhill climb of about 3 miles to Camel Gap. Once to the gap I had another climb up Cosby Knob which was fairly steep. Up at the top I stopped and had my lunch and then dropped down again to Low gap. I arrived at Cosby Shelter and decided to push on to the next shelter which would make for my biggest day yet. The last climb of the day was Mt. Cammerer which was under 5000 feet but of coarse was the steepest of the day. Once to the top it was only 5.2 miles to Davenport Gap and all downhill. The radar showed an intense line of storms moving in from the west so I tried to boogie to beat the rain. The last 2 miles felt like 100 but at last I arrived and there was space in the shelter. I had texted Luigi that I had pushed on from Cosby and that there was rain coming. Once at the shelter I set up, filtered water and made dinner. Luigi showed up about an hour later and must have decided to push on and she beat the rain. The heavens opened and it poured. I did walk in the rain for about 20 minutes coming down the big hill but it was mostly light rain and I barely got wet. Tons of people are showing up now to the shelter who are soaked. We are trying to fit everyone. If anyone else shows they are gonna have to sleep on the floor as it is now a full house. I am so proud of myself for doing 19.7 miles today.","Pecks Corner Shelter

I had not seen them since Fontana Dam. They were picking up their 2 dogs today Stella and Baxter. Gosh it made me miss Sandy Pup so bad. Had a cold breakfast of just a pop tart. The rain had stopped and it was just wet. I got on trail about 7:30 in the morning and started the hike down to the highway underpass. About 15 minutes into the hike it started to downpour. It poured for about 30 minutes. I came to the northern boundary and have left the Smokies. It was so amazing to be able to hike through the whole park. I got to the creek crossing which you cross the creek 5 times. The creek was in flood which made for an interesting crossing. It was kinda fun, it made me thankful for having boots on instead of trail runners. You had to submerge your entire foot to get across. I continued down and got to cross a river over a bridge, this being my first. I then got to the I-40 highway and was like what is that? Traffic?!!! Ha ha. It's so weird to see it after about a month. Luigi was stopping at Standing Bear Farm to get her package and I'm not sure if she was planning on staying. I hope we meet up again as I really enjoyed my two weeks hiking together. She really is a fantastic person. I then began the tough climb up snowbird mt. This climb was miserable. First to me the trail was poorly done. Between steep switchbacks and horrible side hilling then add mud and rivers running down it made for an unpleasant 4 mile trek straight up. When I got to the summit it was a bald in pea soup fog. So not much of a view. I trekked on descending down the other side. The sun finally broke through which made for a better day. I stopped at groundhog creek shelter for privy use and to have lunch. After lunch I had the next big climb up Max Patch. I counted and I had 15 assents and descents today. Made for tough going. The climb up Max Patch wasn't as miserable as Snowbird but it was very muddy and had 10 separate climbs which got you higher and higher in elevation. My legs were about ready to give up. Suddenly there was a sign that said .40 miles and you could see the grass. When I got to the official top it was pretty EPIC. An emotional moment which made the whole day of SUCK go away. Wow wow wow wow was said about 20 times. I then descended down max patch and met up with Feather. We hiked the rest of the way to the shelter. When I arrived at the shelter you could tell the pack is shrinking. There are only 8 people here tonight. 4 tenting and 4 in the shelter. I met Susan, Jc and Kate and Fryer Tuck. We all had a good time talking while making dinner. I feel pretty damn good considering I did 19.7 miles yesterday and 18.7 today. My hiker legs have arrived. Tomorrow I'm going into Hot Springs. It will be a long day of hiking before I get there but can't wait for a shower. Overall I'm doing ok. My feet are sore occasionally but not to bad. I have no blisters. My legs throb every now and then but no real issues with knees. The only real pain I experience is when I sleep my lower back sometimes is in pain. Especially if I end up on my back. Generally speaking though it only hurts at night. I forgot to mention that Davenport Shelter, the last in the Smokies still had the chain link fence in front of it with a door. It felt like we were a zoo for the wild life.","Davenport Gap Shelter

I resisted the urge to not move and got up and packed, ate a cold breakfast and got my rain suit on. I said goodbye to Susan and Feather and got on trail by 8am. The rain stopped immediately after getting on trail. That was a bonus. The first 4 miles were an easy downhill and then I had my first climb of the day up Walnut Mt which was a grassy knob. Not nearly as awesome as Max Patch and it was pretty cloudy. I stopped at Walnut Mountain Shelter to take off my rain gear and have a snack. My next climb of the day was Bluff mountain which was steady long up but not terrible. Then the long descent into Hot Sorings began. It was pretty much all downhill except for two small climbs, one of them being Deer Park Mt. A couple people passed me and I passed them and they were familiar faces from the first couple of days I the trail. Finally I came around the corner and could see down into Hot Springs. The descent seemed to take forever as the town never really seemed to get any closer. I finally arrived and the trail goes right down Main Street. I called several places including the two hostels and no one answered the phone. Finally I got a text from someone named Frank saying how can I help you. It was the Creek Side Court. I reserved a room checked in. I immediately gathered all my clothes and headed to the laundromat next door. Did my laundry and the finally got to take a hot shower just because I could. Wow did that feel good. I then headed down Main Street to the diner and got cheese fries and Pizza for dinner. Relaxed for awhile at the diner then walked back to the motel. I washed all my dishes and laid them out to dry. I then lounged for a bit. At around 8:30 I walked across the street and got a hard cider at the bar across the way and passed out at around 9:30.

This morning was my 4th shower just because I could. After breakfast I went to the post office to pick up my packages. Unfortunately the package Jeff sent me is MIA. The biggest issue is my pills were in the package and we are not sure where they are. So Jeff is going to get the tracking number and see if he can find it. Meanwhile I headed over to Dollar General for resupply. Took my bags back to the motel room and repacked and organized. I mailed home a small box of stuff I don't need and got on trail. The trail leads down Main Street and then follows the river. It made a sharp turn and went up steeply. It was actually very interesting trail design as it followed up and over rock cliffs. I went about three miles and the weather took a turn for the worse. It started to rain and the wind picked up.    I suited up and trekked on. About an hour later the rain stopped the sun came out and it started to dry out. I went up and over three rises and was about a mile away from the shelter I was planning on staying at when it started to downpour sleet. It actually hurt it was coming down so hard. I arrived at the shelter and the sleet had stopped. The shelter was full and there was no cover for me to put my pack down. I was wet and it was windy I decided to move on to keep warm. I started to dry out but of coarse the trail followed the ridge for several miles. No place to camp to be had. After another many miles I got to a road crossing hopping there was a place to camp and again none. I got to a dirt road which had a hostel on it. The book listed that they close at 7 and I had no phone reception. Figures!   I kept walking and it started to rain again. After dragging myself up this very steep incline I came across a campsite. I frantically set up my tent as the rain started to get heavier. I threw all my gear in and am now trying to stay warm as the rain pours down. Hopefully it stops tonight and dries out.

Not in a bad way but in a good way. Thinking about Trooper and I at Gooch Mountain shelter seems like months ago. Anyways I don't think I mentioned yesterday I hiked 10 miles through the burned out section from the fire. It was still smoking in some parts but with the rain it smelled like wet campfire. It was almost nauseating at times. I woke up today around 6:30. Packed up the wet tent and my now wet sleeping pad. Got on trail at 7:30 and pushed off. The weather wasn't too bad but as I made my way up camp creek bald mountain I walked into the clouds and it was foggy and wet. The wind picked up and made for a very wet day. I stopped at little laurel shelter for a snack and sign the log book. I went over the summit and did not bother to take the blue blaze trail to the fire tower because with all the fog I wasn't expecting to see much. I started my way down and came across a sign that read Greenville Tennesee Hiking Club 6th annual Trail Magic Friday May 6th from noon to 10am May 8th. I was like no way we are in the middle of nowhere. But I followed the sign on the side trail to Jones Meadow where 20 people had set up 4 tents and tarps and had all kinds of food. Hamburger, hot dogs, baked goods, chips, soda, homemade bread. The list goes on and on. The best part was today is my sisters birthday and I have been looking for a card for two weeks. No place had cards and I couldn't even find on in Hot Springs. The people at the trail magic had cards with pictures of the AT and already a stamp on the envelope. All I had to do was fill it out. I still can't get over the trail magic. It was wonderful and made for a much better afternoon than morning. Next I climbed Firescalp Ridge which had a bad weather bypass. I wouldn't want to be caught up there in a thunderstorm but it was ok. Foggy but at points you could see into the valley. It started to sleet by the time I got to the end. I came down off the ridge and treked down to the next shelter Jerry's Cabin. It was a stone structure with a fireplace. It was different than most. After using the privy and signing the log I was back on my way. My next big climb was big butt mountain. I laughed at the name and thought of how did the mountain get its name. It started to sleet again but this time much harder then earlier. Big chunks of ice, it almost seemed like hail but we didn't have the right convection for hail nor a thunderstorm. I climbed down off of big butt and descended for 4 miles and than had a steep climb up Flint Mountain where I stopped at Flint Mt Shelter to snack and than make my way down to Devils fork gap. There were 2 hostels there and I called the first, they were sold out. I called the second one when I got to the gap as they said in the guidebook they are open till 7 and will pick you up at the trail and return you. I called some man answered and said yeah that place closed in December and I'm the lucky person that got their old number. Now I was like crap I guess I'll hike on till the next place I can tent. Well that ended up being 4 miles and 2000 feet in elevation gain later. I got to camp at 8 tried to get a fire going, used my rope to make a clothes line to dry out my wet tent or try to.

I chatted with corn for awhile and then was back on trail. My next big climb was high rock. Then a steady down to Sam's gap. When I arrived to the gap and headed towards the parking area, BJ was setting up trail magic. She had bought a whole bunch of fried chicken from Bojangles and also has biscuits, mashed potatoes and macaroni. It was fantastic and two days in a row now. After leaving Sam's gap I had my next big task of climbing up and over Big Bald. The summit was incredible and crystal clear panoramic views. Besides corn I had not seen another hiker today. Corn caught up to me on Big Bald but quickly disappeared. That guy can hike, he's a machine. I climbed down to big bald shelter where corn and his dad were. I stopped in to filter water and to sign the log book. I pushed on and had to climb over little bald and then all downhill to a campsite. When I arrived some familiar faces were there. Set up my tent, ate dinner and relaxed. The wind is crazy tonight. Holy crap. Squall line moving through with some rain. It was windy in the afternoon but this is crazy. I would guess gusting 50-60 as you can hear branches breaking in the forest. Please nothing fall on me. I met thistle and holy diver as well as 5 others who I did not catch their trail names.

As we all were packing up everyone was talking about thinking of having trees falling on them. A few people commented that when the wind blew hard they could feel the earth move as the roots were moving under ground. Kinda of a scary feeling I'm sure. I ate a cold breakfast and got on trail by 8:30. There were only 3 climbs today. The first was immediately after camp and was called big rocks. Fairly easy climb and there was a blue blaze side trail to a pile of rocks on the knob summit. Then I had a gradual descent down to Spivey Gap where there was a cooler of trail magic. The cooler was full of trash but there was still a bottle of ginger ale and orange Fanta left. I opted for the orange Fanta. Next I had the steepest climb of the day up to no business knob. The climb first followed at creek which was fairly steep then leveled off again before rising sharply to no business knob shelter. This shelter was the first on the trail which was made out of cinder blocks. There was one more climb and then all downhill to Erwin. I came to the top of the last knob but wait it went down and then another rise. Oh come on don't do that to me, but there were 4 more like that. The trail loves to trick you like ha ha your not yet done. I finally got to the outlook and could see Erwin. After what seemed like 50 switchbacks the town finally got closer and there was Uncle Johnny's. The bunk house and cabins were full but you could tent for 11 dollars. Sold!! It included a shower and towel. I jumped in the shower first thing as this leg of the hike I was super dirty. I then out my rain pants on and threw all my clothes in the wash. At 5:30 the hostel does a free shuttle into town for free. My laundry wasn't done yet but I said screw it. To town I go in just blue rain pants and a down coat. We all ended up mostly eating at a Mexican Restaurant. I got burritos which I've been thinking about for three days. We also had time to run into Walmart before the shuttle picked us up at 7:30. I got back to Uncle Johnny's and put my clothes in the dryer. Now just sitting and charging my phone. Tomorrow I'm headed into town on the free morning shuttle to get breakfast and pick my package up at the post office. Then back on trail. I'm gonna try and run and get to Damascus Virginia for trail days. This is the 30th anniversary and 30k are expected to be there. Holy Diver, Ghost, Thistle, Karma and little John are all here at the hostel as well as the rest of the crew from last night.","Whistling Gap Campsite

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532241,"Woke up at Uncle Johnny's around 7am. I wanted to make sure I got up in time to get the free shuttle to town. I got up and took a shower and packed up the stuff inside my tent. I then got dressed and sat on the porch area and charged my phone and other electronics while waiting for the shuttle. We loaded in and got driven to the front of huddle house. The post office was just down the street and I walked to it to pick up my package from a fellow Lyndon State College Alumn. Then I walked back to McDonald's and had breakfast. I started with chicken biscuit meal with an iced coffee and 2 burritos. Then I went back up and ordered a large iced coffee. Then I went back up and ordered a sausage egg mcmuffin. I got back on the shuttle at 10 and it drove us back to Uncle Johnny's. I packed up my tent and all my food and my pack and put on my pack. I was like good grief didn't I learn my lesson in Franklin. Ugh heavy,heavy pack again. I'm stronger this time and can handle it. The climb coming out of Erwin was actually almost pleasant I thought to myself. Then I turned the corner and it was straight up. Damn I jinxed myself. I got to the first shelter curly maple gap and had a snack and dried out my feet. The biggest difference today since the beginning of the trail was humidity. The dew point in Erwin when I left at 11 was 63. I was sweating buckets coming up the first climb. With the sun out it was hot. The climb leveled off and followed a ridge for awhile doing small ups and downs. I climbed down to Indian Grave Gap and then started back up the climb to Beaty spot bald. This climb albeit not horribly difficult was in a straight line so you could see all the way to where the top was which was a bit discouraging. Finally I made it to beauty gap and it was 360 panoramic views again. Wow. I pushed on after filling my water in the gap nearby. I then decided to climb up and over Unaka Mt then make camp in the gap below. The climb up Unaka was steep and rocky. Much steeper than what the guide book indicated. I made it almost to the summit and found a good stealth camp spot. Otter was there camping as well and we chatted while I set up my tent. Finally got situated and made a big batch of chicken flavored rice. Sat and talked with other while I made dinner and ate. Great spot under a bunch of pine trees with a nice fire spot. The wind is lightly rustling through the trees which is very soothing. The rain has held off thus far.","Uncle Johnny's Hostel

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532484,"The morning started out partly sunny and dry even though it did rain lightly during the night. I got up about 7 and Otter was up as well. We chatted while eating a cold breakfast and packing up. We got on trail at about 8:30 am. We had a short climb up to the summit of Unaka Mt as I didn't quite make it last night. Then a rather big descent downhill to low gap. Then the ups and downs began. My pack on the first hill felt like 80 pounds. In Erwin I tried to gauge how much food I would need based on how hungry I have been. Well I guess I overdid it because I was struggling. Otter was in a similar boat. Leaving town seems to suck as you do this again and again. What I need to remember is that now I am hiking 17+ mile days I'm gonna get to towns earlier so I really only need 2 or 3 days of food. We pushed on to Cherry Gap Shelter to have a snack and use the privy. But surprise no privy at this shelter so I took the shovel provided and off I went. We turn had to go up and over Little Bald knob which had a series of 6 ups and downs to get to the summit, even though the guidebook shows it as 1 climb. We came down off of that and got to Iron Mountain Gap crossing Route 107 in TN and NC 226. I guess the same road but the crossing was right at the border again. The coming out of the gap we had to climb up rock pillar. It had a very cool rock outcrop on top. Then there were a series of 8 ups and downs which weren't long but steep. Through the coarse of the day my feet started to hurt. Very similar to what happened to me climbing out of Franklin. Otter and I talked about trail days as he wanted to go as well as me. I originally had thought I was gonna be able to make it to Damascus where trail days takes place by walking. But as I got closer to the actual date I would of had to walk 21 miles a day which seemed excessive. I didn't want to over due it. So we talked about different options. We were hearing that this being the 30th anniversary of trail days and 100 anniversary of the Appalachian Trail they were expecting big crowds. So the recommendation for thru hikers was to get there Thursday morning to buy your wrist band and get into the area to set up camp. So where it was Tuedsay we were trying to figure out our options. One was to hike through and over Roan Mt which is over 6000 feet and the last big climb until Vermont. Then get off trail and see about hitching or getting a shuttle. The other option was to go to Greasy Gap Hostel and see if they would do slack packing or a shuttle to Damascus and that would leave the big climb of Roan Mt until after we got back. This seemed like a good idea as both of our feet were killing us. Then otter had an idea. He has a summer house in Hot Springs with a car at it. If we could get a shuttle from the hostel to Hot Springs we could grab coolers and buy food and drinks (thus avoiding all the food vendors) and take his car to Damascus getting us there early to camp. It's only 5 dollars to tent in tent city. CHEAP! So we said lets do it. We got to Greasy Creek Gap and took the side trail .6 to the hostel. We had only gone 10 miles but it felt like 30. We got to the hostel and bought some sodas and the nice lady who owns the hostel gave us a guys number who would shuttle us. We called and he said he woukd be there in 45 minutes. We took our sodas and our boots off and sat in the grass. The shuttle driver showed up and we headed back to hot springs. Thursday morning me,Otter, Little Foot, OSHA, and free fall are gonna head to Damascus. I had the best chicken fingers at Ironside bar and grill last night. We got back to Otter's house and crashed.","Unaka Mountain stealth campsite

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532786,Taking a day off today. I slept in until almost 10 on Wednesday and woke to a train of thunderstorms. We got dressed and showered and headed to breakfast in town. It was teaming rain and I mean teaming rain. Thank god I'm taking today off. This would be awful to packing up camp in and also awful to hike in. After breakfast we all got back to the house and packed for Damascus. I took out all the things I'm not gonna need at Trail Days. I lounged for awhile listening to music. Around lunch time we drove over to Ashville NC and stopped at 12 Bones BBQ which was a local restaurant. Yummy. I got pulled pork sandwich and it was fantastic. Afterwards we headed over to REI as I am having issues with my boots with the eyelits shredding my boot laces. I have gone through 4 pairs since I started my hike. I'm afraid that my laces will break and I'm not gonna have a spare and be 30 miles from any town. So after some phone calls we were able to find the purchase under troopers membership. I remember them not being able to find or look up Jeff and my's account back when I bought them in January. So I just put it under Troopers so she could get the credit. REI was great they just let me swap out the boots. I had them measure my foot and I went with the exact same boot but in a 10 1/2 opposed to the 11. Otter ended up dealing out his trail runners as he kept getting blisters. This whole process took almost 2.5 hours. We then headed back to Hot Springs via going through the Blueridge. So pretty!! We stopped at Ingall's grocery store to buy some supplies for Trail days. Ate dinner in hot springs and then crashed going to bed early. Up at 5 am tomorrow.,"Greasy Creek Hostel?? Hot Springs

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532898,Woke up this morning at Otters house about 4:30 am. We packed up the car and left his house by 6:30. Otter brought his 5 person tent that he had won several years ago and never used. I was like nice we will have more room than our dinky 2 person tents. We drove north out of Hot Springs on a bunch of roads I'm not sure of what route numbers. We stopped at Bojangles so I could get something to eat as I was starving snd we stopped at Starbucks in Johnson City in Tennessee to get coffee. We got in I-81 north towards Bristol VA. We got off on the Abingdon VA exit and winded our way via back roads to Damascus. We paid the 20 dollar parking permit for the weekend and bought our 5 dollar entrance fee to tent city and set up. Afterward we wandered through the vendors outside of tent city and walked down to Main Street. We ended up getting lunch at Bobo's and stopped at Dollar General go buy beer. We then headed back to the ball fields where tent city was set up. I stopped at the Vasque Booth and talked to them about the issue I had with my boots. The laces kept getting shredded by the eyelits. I told them that REI let me swap them out. But the booth gave me 4 sets of boot laces to have on me in case this pair does it too. She said she was not aware of an issue with this type of boat. Otter decided to have Osprey look at his pack as one of the clips would let go if you put any pressure on it. They took his pack and gave him a pick up ticket snd said they would put a brand new clip on it. We then caught up with little foot who ended up renting a car so she could take 9 more people to trails instead of just the 5 of us in one car. She asked if we could follow her back to Abingdon to drop off the rental car at Enterprise and then give her a ride back to Damascus and she would give Otter gas money. We said sure. After we brought her and got back we walked back to the tent and we're ready for bed at 5. We sat in our camp chairs and chilled. It rained briefly and then when I saw on radar it was gonna pour we hoped in the tent played cards and ate everything in site. Once the rain stopped I wandered over to the ministry building across from the ball field to charge my phone. Drink free coffee and eat free cookies. Otter stayed back to read his book on his kindle snd to crash. I'm just sitting here to let my phone charge. Not a lot of events going on today as this is arrival day. Tomorrow though we will go down to the vendor row snd visit the 300 tents.,"Hot Springs

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533111,"Woke up at around 6:30 on Friday morning. No idea why I woke up so early but this is the routine now I guess in the woods. Last night tent city was alive. People were hooting and hollering. Not disrespectful but they were having a good time. At one point around 10:45 a group were dancing the wooded trail with loud music through the woods were we were tenting. Otter and I were like boy we are old. We got up to find coffee and debated on playing music and yelling for everyone to get up at 6:45 am. We figured we'd be lynched so we decided against it. We walked down shady street where tent city is to Main Street. A guy picked us up while we were walking and brought us to Exxon where we could buy coffee. We the headed back to the Ministry building to charge our phones and discovered they were giving out free coffee. The building also had free feet washing and massage, free haircuts and free showers across the street. The table in front of us had about 800 beanies made by the church ladies for the event. Again free to the hikers. I took one. About an hour later we walked back through the 8 vendors by tent city to sign up for the raffles. We dropped off and changed into cooler clothes and walked down to the town park where vendor row was. We stopped at almost every table, signed up for a bunch of raffles. You have to be present when they draw the raffles so I put each time in my phone. I met Badger who wrote Appalachian Trials and met AWOL who wrote the guidebook and the book AWOL on the Appalachian Trail. When I said I'm Storm he was like you've emailed me some corrections. I said yes I did and will continue to do so as I go north. He said thank you please do. After going through all the booths we and eating a hot dog and sweet tea we headed back to tent city. We went to the 1pm drawing for Gregory (didn't win) but I did get one of those bowls you snap together from them throwing into the crowd. We then walked across to the ministry building for coffee again and they gave us another hot dog and some Asian slaw which was really good. I was surprised as I usually don't like slaw. It was then about time to walk back to vendor row to be present for the raffle drawings. Nothing until we got to Kelty. I won trekking poles and Otter won dry storage cases. After all the sun and heat we went back and took our free showers. We then walked back to camp made a fire and vegged. We are food out of my food bag and I drank 2 beers. Our site was kind of at the cross roads so many many came over. I've hung with and met so many hikers. Luigi was feeling a little under the weather and I put her name in on a bunch of the raffles. With this being the 30th anniversary so many people here. Met many people who hiked 10, 20, 30 years ago. With social media it has helped past thru hikers keep in contact. Families are here who's parents Thru hiked. A couple tenting next to us are in their mid 60's. Last night was loud and crazy but everyone was so well behaved. Very respectful and keeping things in order. It's so nice to see the ENTIRE town pull together to do this for the hikers. Another wow moments","Damascus VA

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533264,"Another crazy night of partying in tent city. Even though there was more people tonight than Thursday night it was actually quieter. I think part of that was due to more activities spread out at the ministry building and I town. A past Thru hiker had come with his band and tented in the woods and were playing cover songs of today's hits. I have no idea how they had power and we couldn't seem them but they had an amplifier and were good. It was nice to have music while watching the fire. We got up earliesh at about 7. It was chilly but sunny. We got up and headed to hunt down coffee. This morning the ministry building was doing a pancake breakfast and they couldn't give our free coffee and have coffee for the breakfast as they didn't have enough equipment to do both. Unfortunately they only took cash and the breakfast only cost 5 dollars. Neither Otter or I at this point had any cash on us and I hadn't seen a bank anywhere. We decided to walk to the Exxon to buy coffee and maybe something breakfast related. We got there and got two coffees and I got a bacon egg n cheese biscuit. I paid and was going to do cash back as an option so I had money on me but it wasn't an option. We drank our coffee and I ate the biscuit. We walked back and packed up some of our stuff. We kinda were thinking about leaving tonight instead of trying to pack up and get out of town when everyone was doing it at the same time. We packed up all the garbage and some of our not needed items. We walked over to the Ministry building and charged our phones for a bit, then headed back to Vendor row to put our names into all the raffles again. We wandered around for awhile and finally I bumped into Ompi who I haven't seen since Fontana Dam. That made me happy snd I got to meet his guy Chad. I was smart this time to get his cell phone number so we can keep in contact. At this point we were hungry snd trying to figure out how to get cash as none of the good vendors take debit cards. We walked into Dollar General and bought a few drinks in hopes of getting cash back. They had signs on the machines that said cash back not available at this time. Well when purchasing my stuff the option popped up and I selected 40 back. The cashier didn't say anything and I was desperate. It does make sense if every hiker is doing cash back they would probably run out of money. It's not a bank but I had not scene an ATM since I got there two days before. Now Otter and I were starving so we walked the Virginia Creeper Trail to Subway and got sandwiches. This was the only none sit down place in town. It helped walking to that part of town as that was where you were to gather for the hiker parade. We finished eating and walked back to our tent. We broke it all down and packed up. Brought it all back to the car and packed to the car. At this point it was 1:45 and the hiker parade which I really wanted to do was at 2:00. We headed back to Main Street and I split from Otter who was gonna watch from Main Street. I walked the Trail back to Subway and meet the 1000's of other hikers that were already there. The premise of the parade is the police, fire, vets, boys scouts, beauty queens march first. Then the hikers march. Not sure if it's like this every year but with this being the 30th anniversary of trail days they had the hikers line up by years. I think the 1990's were grouped together then the 2000's then 2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015 then 2016 at the end. The towns people all line the streets with hoses, water guns etc to clean off the dirty hikers. Where it was cloudy, windy and in the high 60's Otter wasn't feeling being soaking wet. He watched and took pictures. The parade ended at the common where vendor row is. We met back up and went to all the booths we signed up for the raffle for. Granite Gear was first and nothing, then we had Hyperlite next and nothing. Kelty was last and I won a 150 dollar sleeping bag. Wohoooo. The final raffle was Backpacker which was nothing but we both got a knife/fork combo they were handing out because we were early. The raffle ended and we jumped into the car and headed back towards Hot Springs. We stopped for coffee as I saw Starbucks and got excited and we grabbed a quick dinner at BK cause we were both starving. We got back to Hot Springs at about 9:30. The plan tomorrow is to wash clothes, wash gear, pack and get back on trail Monday morning. I'm going to stop at post office to send home either the new gear or the old gear. The weather looks decent the rest of the week.","Tent City

Once I got up I gathered everything I owned and put it in the wash. While the wash was going I took everything out of my pack. I made sure I wasn't carrying any trash or packaging I didn't need. Next I repacked my pack pulling out everything I'm sending home. I found a box in Otters garage that I could use and piled all the stuff I wasn't taking with me I it. A lot of the stuff was things I picked up at trail days and don't want to carry. I decided to use the dri-down sleeping bag and send my old one home. The dri-down is much lighter.

Showered dressed and we headed to the diner. I wanted to load up on lots of food before I got back on trail. We sat with a bunch of thru hikers and exchanged stories. After we finished breakfast we headed back to Otter's house. I packed up my bag and packed up the box that I was sending home. We ran to the post office so I could mail the box home. Otter texted a bunch of people to see if we could get a ride to Greasy Creek Gap. I went inside and mailed my box. Before I left I asked the post office lady if I had a card here that Jeff's mom had mailed me. She went and looked and came back with not only the letter but the package that Jeff mailed me to Hot Springs that was missing. Yay yay. Looking at both the wrong zip code for hot springs was written. Well now we know why the package didn't arrive on time. After I finished up with that we ran to Asheville so Otter could buy new shorts that weren't so long and a head band. We stopped at Zaxby's for lunch as I had never been. It was good for a fast food place. We then headed back to his house. It was 3pm and no one was able to give us a ride back to Greasy Creek. Besides a shuttle which would be 100 bucks. No thanks. Otter said he would drive me back and should be able to get a ride from Will either on Tuesday or Wednesday. He's done most of this section except for Roan mountain and said he can either get slack packed to catch up with me. So hopefully he catches back up with me because I've enjoyed his company over the last 2 weeks. We headed north stoping at DQ because the urge to resist is nill. We arrived at greasy creek gap hostel at about 5:30. I threw my pack back on and headed the .50 miles back to the AT. Thank god my pack feels lighter and more comfortable. The new boots are still slowly being broken in so I wore double socks. I stopped at the first shelter because I got a message from Ompi saying he was at the first shelter. When I arrived no Ompi so I signed the log and saw that he was heading on. I pushed on and made it over Little Rock Knob and headed down to Hughes Gap where route TN 1330 crosses. At this point it got dark and the head lamp went on. First time night hiking. Well apparently at the road crossing Ompi was camping and I passed him. So he's behind me but will catch up. I walked 8.3 miles and arrived at Ash Gap at 10:30. I climbed 1200 feet which is 1/2 way up Roan Mt. Set up my tent and hung my bear bag.

I woke back up and quickly jumped up and tried to pack up before anymore rain came down. Well the rain started up again before three minutes went by. I quickly stuffed everything into my pack and got on trail by 9:00. I realized while climbing Roan Mt I had packed all my food into my pack and didn't have any snacks out. I hiked into the clouds and it was wet and windy. I summited Roan to no views and started down the other side. There was a fireplace remanant right on the trail which was from a ranger station post possibly. The trail this morning was nicely laid and went through a beautiful spruce forest. Once over the summit the trail had a gradual grade down and looked like an old road. I arrived at Carvers Gap where the auto road up Roam Mt begins. There was a privy at the gap. Yay!! Pooping in the woods in the rain is by no means an easy feet. My next to climbs where both balds. Jane's Bald being the first which was docked in pea soup fog. No views. ??. But I've been lucky on this trip so I can't complain. I started down the other sides of the balds and arrived at Stan Murray shelter. I ate lunch and dried out and tried to warm up a bit. I pushed on after calling Jeff and calling Trooper. The next few miles were easy grades and I arrived at the blue blaze that took me to the red barn. I arrived at mountaineer shelter at about 3 pm and decided it's early but I am so exhausted I'm falling asleep. I decided I'm staying the night as this is too cool to pass up. Hey why rush and push for miles when you will miss out on an awesome experience. The shelter is an old red barn which has been converted into a shelter. It sleeps 20. There is a picnic table under a covering in the front with 2 platforms on either side which sleeps 4 per platform. The upstairs sleeps about 20. I set up my stuff in one corner and went down to filter water. I got back to the loft and took a nap or two hours. I woke to the sound of people walking. A group of 5 high school kids arrived who were doing this as a school project. I got up and started making dinner. When I came down little Jon was there. We chatted while we cooked dinner and ate. A group of three guys showed up, then Ompi showed and I was psyched. We all sat around talking while others made dinner. I met Special K who is a 14 year old girl who is thru hiking and her mom is following in an RV. If she finishes she will be the youngest person to Thru hike in the same 6 months. Wow how inspiring.

There were the 5 high school kids so were doing a section hike as part of a school project. Ompi was there. Then mayfly, simple and Jake the fake. He has a blog on Trail Journals. Pete look him up he recognized me from my journal and he started a few days before me so I finally caught him. Special K the 14 year old. Then Jackrabbit and Jefe came about 11 pm as they were night hiking. Said goodbye to everyone. Ompi was the only one who neat me out. I pushed off and about 2 miles in came across the first bald. The fog had lifted and what a WOW MOMENT!! After the first bald you could see the next bald behind. It was an epic 6 miles. Great scenery and great pictures were taken. The climb down was an easy grade and I got caught by three section hikers singing my heart out with my head phones on. They were laughing and said you sound like a dying angel. I guess that's a compliment. Ha ha. I came to the official sign that said leaving North Carolina. Every time I think I'm out of North Carolina she comes back. Now officially done. Wohooo. I got to US 19 in Tennessee and sat on the side of the road and ate my lunch. Several people driving by honked and waved. It's so nice to be respected and treated so nice. After lunch I ran across the street as the people coming up the hill seem to hit the gas when a hiker is in the road. Maybe it's like a video game for them. The climb outta the gap wasn't too bad. I came across I nice field and the trail followed and ok keep road. It winded through fields and next to a cemetery. I crisscrossed a road 3 times that the cemetery was on and finally came back into a white pine forest. The trail winded back and forth up and down. It started to rain about 4:30 and the last mile to the shelter seemed to take forever. It wasn't too bad but I was wet. Finally arrived at the shelter and I was the only one here. Very weird. The herd is really thinning out. I gathered wood for my stove and filtered water. I cooked and now am running the stove charging my phone. It's been boosted 30% in two hours. Not to bad.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534077,"Woke up around 6:30 to rain so I decided to go back to sleep. After I posted the blog last night two more late arrivals came which were breakneck and a girl who I don't think I heard her trail name or real name. They arrived at 9:45 as Jefe, Jack rabbit and myself were about to head to bed. They were so thankful that there was room in the 3 tierd shelter. It was really nice and rather new and an enjoyable place to spend the night. I pushed off at about 9 and it looked like a rather easy day as the topo map in the book was relatively a straight line. After about 1/2 a mile I was covered in mud. With the rain from overnight the trail was the consistency of molasses. Think enough to hold its shape but once you stepped you sunk in. It made for tough walking as it took twice the effort. My prior hiking buddy Otter texted me that he had a ride back to the trail. He had already walked this section so wasn't too worried where to get dropped off. He said he might go to the hostel near lower Laurel forks but I told him I already passed it. I suggested go to Dennis Cove road as I should get there around 3:30. It gave me a goal so I set out to boogie. The terrain today was pretty lackluster. Winding through a dense Forrest of oak and mountain laurel there wasn't too much scenery. Like the last two days again today a lot of plants had been hit by a frost that we had on Saturday night. I forgot to mention it before but above 3000 feet in North Carolina and in Tennesee was hit by a frost. Many ferns, mayapple and some of the new trees leaves got hit. It was a patchy frost but still enough to do some damage. So between the mud, fog, clouds and not much to look at the day was kind of boring. I did pass a cascade which was listed in the book. Well after Jones Falls this cascade wasn't too impressive. I was surprised they named it. I forget the name and already burned that page of the log book. I arrived pretty much on time and Otter was waiting for me and he brought his dog ghost. Sandy would love ghost. I think they need a play date. Otter brought me 3 cheeseburgers from Burger King. I was in heaven and they tasted like heaven in a bun. I repacked my bag and organized and we pushed on. This section of the trail follows the Laurel river and the trail goes up and over some really interesting rock formations. The trail then descends steeply to Laurel Falls which has a large pool in front of. I stripped down and was gonna jump in and then stepped in the water... I went numb. So instead I bathed, soaked my head and washed up. I threw the stick just like I would with Sandy in the pond and Ghost went nuts. We stayed at the falls for an hour and pushed on for another mile or so. We found a great spot aling the river to set up camp. We made a fire and had dinner snd crashed about 9. Tomorrow I gotta go into Hampton to get a package from Chris Lovell. Not staying in town just a quick in and out. We have one climb tomorrow which is Pond Flats mountain. Then it's a straight shot into Damascus which is only 45 miles away.","Mountaineer Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534265,"Woke up to the sound of the river and the cascades. Such a soothing sound. I got out of the tent to Otter making coffee. Wohoo. We drank coffee and I made some oatmeal. We packed up and pushed off about 9am. The plan was to walk the mile to the side trail which takes you into Hampton. I had a package from Chris Lovell to pick up. We got to the side trail and it runs along the river which was so pretty. The side trail was 1 mile to the road and 1.5 miles to the end of town with subway and Dunkin Donuts. We headed to the post office first and I picked up my package. Then we headed down to Subway and had some lunch. Then I ran across the street to get an iced coffee. Yum yum yum. On the way we saw a copperhead snake. Eeeeeek. After Dunkin Donuts we stopped at Dollar General to charge our phones and to buy what resupply we needed. We then headed back to the AT. At this point we had walked 5.5 miles and it didn't count for anything. At this point it was 1pm and we had only walked a mile on the AT. The only climb we had for the day was up and over Pond Flats. We started up and this climb was over 2000 feet in elevation gain in less than 2 miles. We pushed and stopped frequently. It was steep.. Ugh. Ghost kept turning to us and looked like ""come on let's move"" Ottter and I were like we are old and slow pup. We made it to the view less summit and started our way back down. I looked at radar and said we need to boogie as rain was coming. There was a campsite .3 miles from the road so that was the goal. We arrived snd decided to set up Otters 3 person tent first as if it did rain we all could be in one tent, eat dinner and play cards. We got it set up just in time and the rain poured down. We ate dinner and hunkered down. With three of us the condensation in the tent was bad and we think water from the rain came in. But we were relatively dry.","Laurel Falls Stealth Campsite

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534416,"We woke up to rain in Otters tent but it was slowing down. The issue we were having is two people and one dog there was so much condensation on the inside of the tent it dropped down on us and got everything soaked. I wasn't sure if it was a combination of that and the rain leaking in but I was in a puddle. We were wet, the dog was wet our gear was wet. Pretty much it was sucky. We brainstormed for a bit to figure out our options. I remembered in the book it said there was a campground .8 off the trail and the book said they did coffee in the morning. Otter and I decided to walk and check out the situation. We grabbed our poles and left everything in the tent. We walked the .30 miles down to the road and were trying to figure out which way was east with the cloudy and foggy day. Otter noticed a sign that said Boots Off Hostel and Campground. I was like that's not in the book. Otter said should I call, I was like sure it's 7:30 but why not, maybe we can dry our gear out. He called and talked to Jim who said they are not officially open yet but come on down. We walked back up the hill and grabbed all of our stuff except for the tent. We walked back down and arrived at the property. Let me just say Jim and Jordan are the nicest people I've met on the trail. They are in the process of building a bunkhouse and other hostel amenities. They are getting close to ready but were so accommodating. They made us breakfast, we were able to take a shower, do laundry. Jim set up a mega tent with cots in the yard in case we decided to stay. With the weather of more rain for the day, all of our gear soaked and me feeling nausea and blisters on my feet we decided to call it a Nero. Jim picked our brains about the hostels we have stayed at and the positives and negatives. We chatted for a couple of hours. Otter and I went out to the mega tent and napped for a few hours. We got up and Jim showed us around the property. We helped them with the bunkhouse layout and gave them a bunch of ideas for placement of things. Around 7 we went into town and had dinner at O'Charleys and went to a bar after. It was a great day off and after my 4 hour nap I felt fantastic. Tomorrow the weather looks good and hopefully it warms up. Anyone hiking north or south and are near Pond Flats call these guys. They will do whatever they can to help you out.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534514,"Woke up around 8:30 in the mega tent      in the yard of Boots Off Hostel and Campground. Otter and I packed up our gear and organized and cleaned out the tent for their next guests. We headed up to the house to find Neil making another fantastic breakfast. Otter had bad news texted to him. Either a family member or family friend passed away. It wasn't anyone immediate or anyone he was super close to but it was one of those moments where he said you don't get a do over on this so I gotta go to the services. So Otters other 1/2 was on their way to pick him up. The poor guy has now been pulled off the trail 3 times for things that keep arising. Luckily he has done the section from near Roan mountain to mid Virginia so it's not a biggie if he misses it. But he really was trying to walk all sections this year but it doesn't seem to be in the cards. He says he will get on either at the hostel and be behind me or find where I am at and get dropped off nearby to me. We shall see but I'm gonna be solo again for a bit. We ate a fantastic breakfast AGAIN and took showers. After showers and breakfast we headed back down to the tent and swept it out. We then brought all of our gear up to the front porch. Around noon Otters ride showed up and he was on his way back to Aiken South Carolina. I stayed for another hour to fully charge my phone. I pushed off about 1pm and just like Otter, Jim wouldn't accept anything from us for our stay. He said all of our Facebook feeds and word of mouth means more to him. He said also that he's been able to pick our brains and get to know the good and the bad about Hostels. He really wants to make his personal and have people have a memorable experience. I thanked them all profusely and shoved off. I found out during the morning that Ompi made it into Damascus so he's about 36 miles ahead. Luigi I believe is near Laurel Falls and the royal couple supposedly are back together and are a day or two north of Damascus. Sarah flew back and I think that might have been where they met. I think Simon (slosh) skipped trail days and passed my location on the trail while I was a trail days. I walked down the road the Hostel was on and arrived at US 321 in TN. I crossed snd you immediately come to Watauga Lake. The trail runs all the way around lake and starts climbing the ridge. This area is closed except for hiking. No camping, the Watauga Shelter is closed. You are not supposed to picnic, stop for any reason and be idle. I guess they are having issues with the Bears. I made it through the 4 mile closed section and arrived at Watauga Dam. The AT follows a dam road for a few miles and then climbs steeply up the ridge. I stopped at Vandeventer Shelter and had lunch which was actually dinner at this point. I ate than pushed on after we had 15 minutes of sleet falling from the sky from a very dark cloud. I arrived at a campsite at around 8pm. Set up and did chores and was about to start a fire when rain started to fall. I jumped into the tent and called it a night. Tomorrow I hope to get into Damascus.","Boots Off Hostel and Campground

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534699,"So I should begin this entry with the fact it's getting really old with the cold. I woke up in the middle of the night freezing. I don't usually get woken up by anything but this was cold. I put on all the clothes and socks I had and hoped it would keep me warm. I got up around 6:30 and noticed there was partial frost outside on some of the plants. Like seriously it's the end of May in the south and its this cold. I made oatmeal and coffee and shivered. I got packed up and shivered. I started on trail about 8:30 and still was shivering. The three people who camped across the trail on the side with the water had told me when I arrived that there was a bear spotted by a passing hiker right before I got there. We never saw the bear but something was crashing around in the woods when I laid down to go to sleep. My goal today was to get as close to Damascus as I could. Main Street in Damascus was 29.2 miles away. I pushed off and had a series of ups and downs. The trail at this point was fairly level in the guidebook which meant no really big climbs. However the reality is you would have a steep climb for .3 miles and then drop back down and the do it again another 22 times. This is what we call NUNDS. Needless ups and downs. Early on I arrived at Iron horse and had a second breakfast and signed the log book. I crossed TN 91 and went back to the ups and downs. I did come to a field which the trail went through and there were manycows. I got to walk amongst them and one of the cows had recently had a calf. The cord was still attached snd it was very neat to see the newborn. Mom was still cleaning the baby up. I should add the entire trail at this point is 6 inches deep with mud from all the rain we've had. It made it super difficult to walk period and took twice as much effort. I arrived at the next shelter double springs. I filtered water and took my boots and socks off to dry out. For some reason the boots I swapped out are giving me grief which they didn't do before. The last pair has faulty eyelits and were shredding my laces, this new pair is great but for some reason the side of my heel keeps getting a sore on both heels. This never happened with the last pair but it's rubbing but there is nothing inside the boot that I can feel that is rubbing. So I mole skinned the area and duct taped it to keep it secure. I walked several more miles snd my right foot was in immense pain. The moleskin must have slipped and was digging into my heel. Now the comedy of errors started. I needed to get my boot off and fix this as it was too painful to keep climbing this needless up. I begin to take my bag off which gets stuck on my arm. I lean forward to loosen the stuck shoulder strap and don't realize they Smitty (the walking stick) has slipped out and falls to the ground. I shake finally releasing my pack and I let it drop to the ground which it clips Smitty and the stick flips up and smashes me in the face. Needless to say a few choice words were said and I plopped onto the ground a bit defeated. I do manage to get all the old moleskin off and rebandage the sore. Good to go again and I push off for some more ups and downs. I'd rather have a 6000 foot climb cause I know at least over the summit we will go down for awhile. This .3 up and .3 down is exhausting. I arrive at Abingdon shelter and need to filter water. Of coarse the water is .4 down a super steep trail. Grrrrrrrrrrrr. But I don't feel so bad as the woman I meet at the bottom was nice enough to fill up everyone's water but then realized she had to carry it all up that hill. I offer but she said no no I'm determined to do this. I get back to the shelter and have a snack. Ompi was taking a zero in Damascus today for his birthday. Through texts he said if you get here I'm making steaks for my birthday. You can have one! Well I looked at the book and realized that I was still 9.4 miles out at 5 so I texted Ompi saying it would be so darn good but don't hold a steak I won't be near there till 9. Now I was more determined to get to Damascus tonight. I pushed off with 9.7 miles to go. 6.7 miles to the TN/VA border. The trail still muddy finally stayed in a down direction after another 73 NUNDs. I arrived at the border at 8:10 pm and was so excited to be entering Virginia. It's crazy to think I am almost up to 500 miles walked. I passed the last designated campsite in the book as it was dark and threw on my head lamp. I arrived at a small campsite just after 9:20. It's so close to town you can see houses. I started a fire and dinner after I set up my tent. Looking at mileage I walked 28.9 miles on the AT snd over a mile in water trails. So i basically did a 30 mile day. Holy crsp. I feel pretty darn good for just waking 30 miles. Tomorrow I have a short walk to breakfast and all the town goodness.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534894,"I woke up again shivering around 6:30. I took out my phone and pulled up Damascus and the weather channel said it was 41. I looked for Tannersville NY in the Catskills and it said 58. Come on how the heck is it colder in southwest Virginia than the Catskill Mountains of New York. This is getting really old now. I forced myself up and packed up and headed the last .3 miles into town. I popped out of the woods literally between 2 houses. The trail follows a side street, then bangs a left and goes down a gravel walkway down the common. This was the where vendor row was during trail days. I walked all the way across the common then the trail makes a right and follows the side walk down Main Street. I have now been thinking about bacon egg n cheese biscuits from the Exxon station I had a trail days. I walked all the way down Main Street and the trail goes right onto another road. At this point the Exxon station was on the corner and I got off trail to go eat breakfast. I debated should I stay in town and take a Nero or do I do all my errands and head back on trail. My feet were a bit sore where my boots were rubbing but not horribly terrible. I knew I needed to eat, resupply, buy new rope and a new multi-tool, shower and do laundry. As I was sitting reading the newspaper I looked out the window and next door was a do it yourself car wash. Hmmmm shower check. I laughed at the visual of showering in a car wash with the big spray gun. No I didn't do it. Ompi texted me to say he was taking another day off as his left foot was giving him problems. I debated but decided what the heck I walked 30 miles yesterday why not take a day off. So I walked back down Main Street stoping at dollar general and an ATM. I checked in at Woodchucks. It was 10 dollars to tent, 2 for a hot breakfast and 5 for laundry. It was a deal in my book. The sun was shining and blue, blue skies. I set up my tent in the yard and put my laundry in first. I updated Facebook and went through emails while laundry was running. I also went through my food bag to determine what I needed for the next 4 days. After laundry I jumped in the shower and black water was running off me. Jeez with all the mud on the trail I was dirty. I sat on the back porch and talked to a bunch of thru hikers. It seems like so many people have gotten hurt due to the mud. The effort involved and the different movements you are making seem to have caused a lot of strain/sprains. I know 3 people here are going to a doctor today. I decided to walk back into town and supply up at dollar general (it's becoming my new friend) and hit the outdoor gear store for rope and a multi tool. I brought all my purchases back to my tent and organized it. At this point it was becoming dinner and I hadn't eaten lunch. I headed down to pizza plus where they have an all you can eat buffet, (AYCE from here on in). I ate 16 slices of pizza and 2 bowls of salad. I left (I think they were glad when I did) and walked through town and through the common. Felt good to walk and on days off I try to keep walking so my legs don't get stiff. I headed back to Woodchucks and hung on the porch for two hours and chatted with Ompi, gasket (who I haven't seen since the smokies) and a few other new faces. Around 8 I thought to myself who can I possibly be hungry again. I resisted the urge and went to bed. Luigi is coming into town today she's 7 miles away. I'm gonna wait for her and we are gonna get chocolate chip pancakes. It's her birthday so it's gonna be my treat (she doesn't know it yet) she turns 30 today.","Stealth Campsite .2 out of Damascus

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535029,"My plan was to sleep in today as I was meeting Luigi for breakfast. She had to hike 7 miles to get into town and she thought she would be here by 10. I was wide awake and looked at my watch 6:30am. Really! So much for sleeping in. Woodchucks gives you a hot breakfast for 2 bucks which was fantastic. Oj, coffee, strawberries, bananas,potatoes, waffles with syrup and whipped cream. It was fantastic. The kitchen was already full as everyone seemed to be up early. Last night wast nearly that cold and it was nice sleeping weather. On the walls in the kitchens dining area where two maps. One global and one of the USA. This hostel has been open since 2014 and they ask every guest to put a pin from where their home is. I was the first to put a pin from the Catskills. After breakfast I packed up all my gear and tent and had my bag ready to go. I spent the time charging all my devices bad chatted with the other hikers there. The weather was another blue bird sky day and it was s beauty. It was gonna be hot and humid finally. Luigi texted me saying she was walking into town. I left the hostel and walked down the street when I realized she was at the restaurant and not coming to the hostel. It was her 30 birthday and I treated her to breakfast. I looked at her and said goodbye 20's and welcome to the 30's party. Luigi got a combo and got her chocolate chip pancakes. No issues and no heads had to roll in the pancake department. They came through and provided choc pancakes with no issues. We walked back to the hostel and Luigi checked in and I got my boots on and suited up to shove off. I said goodbye to Ompi and gasket. Both were taking another zero as Ompi was letting his foot heal and gasket was waiting for his friend to heal. A lot of people injured themselves coming into Damascus due to the mud and trying to do crazy big days. I pushed off at about 1ish and walked down Main Street to mail a few postcards at post office. The trail follows Main Street then goes right following US route 58 which then the AT joins the Virginia Creeper trail. I had to follow that for .40 miles. I almost stepped on copperhead snake which was just sitting on the trail. I thought it was a stick. Jeez!! The trail crossed route 58 and we got right at it climbing up up up. I'm getting used to this come into town happy and dreaming of food. Leave town and you pay!! It wasn't to bad but I'm not sure if it was because I have trail legs. The pitch and steepness I was thinking I should be resting, breathing heavy, sweating right now but I'm good. Such a weird feeling. I took a couple of breaks to drink water as it was warm and humid. After about 3 miles I stopped to drink and I see little John coming up the trail. I haven't seen him since over mountain shelter which was the big red barn that got converted to a shelter. We walked and chatted for several miles. The trail came over the first high point and we descended back down to the river. We crossed over route 58 again and the trail reconnected for a bit with the Virginia Creeper Trail. It then followed the trail for 2 miles and this section was just beautiful and the sound of cascades was really nice. I so wanted to jump in but the water level was just too high and the current too strong. It was muggy and the water looked so inviting. We turned away from the river and the trail went straight up for 2 miles. We gained 1100 feet of elevation and the trail was a series of 12 switchbacks. We stopped for a water break where the AT makes a u turn and there is another trail that stays straight ahead. This goes back to the Virginia Creeper within a mile. While sitting there Tarzan came up the trail. He had passed me at Watauga Lake but I didn't know his trail name. He said hello up little John and myself and I thought he was waking to sit on the other side of me but he kept on trekking. I was like no no no wrong way. I almost didn't catch him. He was so thankful and didn't notice that the AT made s U-turn. He would of been walking at least a mile out of his way. We continued back up the trail and came across knot who tented next to Otter and I at trail days. He's about 10 years older than me and was dying in the humidity too. We finally came across a sign for the shelter which was a .25 mile blue blaze. We arrived and I set up my tent while little John jumped into the shelter. We made dinner and sat around and chatted before it was hiker midnight. So we thought we looked at our watches and it was only 8:25 but it was bed for all of us. Only about 9 miles today but I was wiped. I had purchased tape for my blisters at dollar general which worked really well. They did not carry moleskin so this was my only option. My two side blisters hurt early on but as it got more humid they boots seemed to stretch and they didn't hurt as bad. I have my socks off and I'm trying to dry them off.","Woodchuck Hostel

Thank god I'm tenting in a pine grove and there are a lot of pine needles as my back is sore but would be so much worse. I got up around 7 and it was just cloudy. I packed up and ate a cold breakfast and got on the trail about 9am. The climb was mostly flat with a few ups and downs. Then the trail descended back down to the river and to the Virginia Creeper trail. The trail followed the creeper trail for awhile then darted back into the woods. Last night at the shelter there was myself and little john, Avalon, David and Gretel. Gretel came after I went to bed. Climbing up from the creeper trail David passed me and said he was probably having lunch at lost mountain shelter. It was only 2 miles away. The trail ran a bunch of switchbacks and I arrived to lost mountain shelter in no time. David was there and so was Avalon. She must of left before I got up. There were also two woman in their sixties with their dogs. One of them I recognized as the woman who sat with Otter and I at breakfast in Hot Springs the morning he was gonna drive me back to greasy creek gap. She was like no I didn't walk here my friend wanted to hike with me for a week so she picked me up in Erwin and we drive north to Greyson Highland State Park and are walking back to Damascus then she will go home and I will continue on till I get back to Erwin and then will get a ride back. They were a hoot. Everyone finished there lunch and headed out. I headed out after filtering water. The trail descended back down and I crossed over US 58 again. This being the third time. The trail ascended at a good clip steady uphill for 5 miles. The trail went through another cow field but I didn't see any cows this time. To get to the summit of Whitetop Mountain we had to gain 2300 feet of elevation. I finally broke above the trees to around 5100 feet and the top was almost similar to a bald. Low shrubs and grasses abundant with fantastic views. The trail then went sharply right with a side trail to the real summit. The trail began to descend again and crossed Virginia 600 and crossed into another cow field on a bald hill covered in all grassland. The cows were all to the left at the bottom of the field near the fence. I discovered I had one package left of Jelly Belly sports beans left. I love these and quickly ate the package. They give you such an energy boost especially when you are dragging. The trail climbed the grassy hill and went into the woods. It followed the ridge for awhile with a slight increase but not noticeable. The trail them descended to deep gap where there was a sign stating 2 miles to the shelter. The trail went up steeply and I believe it was on Mt Rogers but curved to the right and circled the mt. After climbing steeply and some switchbacks it leveled off and I came across a field and there were wild ponies. I was able to walk out amongst them and filmed it. If you want to see the video go on Moe Hikes the Appalachian Trail as I posted it there. It was so cool to see the ponies. Just amazing. The last mile of the climb I could feel that I was running on empty. I was getting starving. The trail again came to a grassy area and you could see Thomas Knob shelter in the distance. I got to the trail junction where the side trail to Mt Rogers was .5 left. I just didn't have the energy to do this tonight so I will run up the summit in the morning. I arrived at the shelter to some familiar faces that I saw at Uncle Johnnies in Erwin. I ate a cold dinner as there was a ban on any fires at the shelter. The view from this location is simply amazing and fantastic. If anyone reading this is behind me going north bound or is headed south bound make sure you plan on staying here or at least having an hour long lunch it is stunning. I set up on the second floor of the shelter. This particular shelter has a ladder with a small hole in the ceiling. It sleeps 16 and there are only 6 of us in the shelter with I think 3 others in hammocks nearby. No storms tonight as we lucked out. They were to our east and west.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535375,"I woke up this morning to someone's alarm going off on their watch. I decided to get up and watch the sunrise and to summit Mt. Rogers. The sunrise was spectacular and to get to the summit the trail was a blue blaze and it was only 1/2 mile. Unfortunately the summit had no view and it was covered in spruce trees. I got back to the shelter and filtered water, took my bear bag down and ate breakfast. At this point it was close to 7:45 so I climbed into the loft and quietly packed up my stuff. The crew that was at the shelter were the other half of the group that Avalon, David and Gretel were hiking with. They were polar bear, trinity and daddy long legs. I stayed with their other group Avalon and company at the Saunders Shelter the night before. The odd thing was all three of them said they were going to Thomas Knob Shelter and either left before me or passed me. I didn't see any of them at the shelter last night and didn't pass them during the day from what I noticed. Really odd. I got on trail at 8am and instantly the trail changed into a rocky outcrops and small bushes. It was really magnificent views 360. This must be the preclude to the Greyson Highlands which were coming up. I descended a rock outcrop and at the bottom there were about 30 wild ponies just grazing along the trail and in the trail. One of the ponies ran up to me assuming I had a snack for it. When I didn't the pony proceeded to lick me apparently getting the salt from my body. I moved on after taking some pictures and making sure the licker wasn't following me. I arrived at the official gate to Greyson Highlands and took some more pictures. Ponies were everywhere mostly in the distance from me. I continued along the trail and most of the ponies started walking north on the AT just in front of me. They all herded together and started going north. I laughed and said talk about a pack of thru hikers. I quickly learned why they were doing this and 1/2 mile up the trail there was a stand of balsams and spruce on the right that they could get under to get out of the sun. It was a very warm morning and by 10am it was almost hot. They were so neat to watch. I continued on leaving the Greyson Highlands and stopped at the next shelter to have a snack. Clouds had formed and it started to sprinkle. I put on my rain cover and continued on. The trail ascended to (Rock top) mountain which was almost like a bald but with more bushes and a few small trees. You could see dark clouds off to the north. I descended and walked past a horse ranch. There were a group of people and about as many horses. I presumed they were going riding. The trail went south of their location and into a grassy parking area. I plopped down taking a break. A forest service employee who was with the people with the horses was leaving but looped around when he saw me and asked if I was alright. I said yes and we chatted for a bit. He was really nice and was letting me know of what was coming north and some nice camp spots. He drove off and I continued north. There was another climb and this one was not to bad. Once to the top it skirted a fence and then descended back down. Now it dawned on me it was the beginning of a holiday weekend as there was a steady stream of day hikers and weekend hikers coming up the hill. I would say I passed 35 people on the descent and I arrived at Old Orchard Shelter where I ate lunch. The sky still looked ominous. The next shelter Hurricane Mountain Shelter was only 4.2 miles and that was where I planned on stopping for the day. I descended for another mile and crossed a dirt road. The trail then ascended again after a stream crossing. This is where after 500 miles of walking I had my first fall. The stream had a wood bridge to cross it and had 4 steps going down to the bridge. I put my foot on the first step and it flew out from under me. I flew through the air landing on my back/pack sliding down all 4 stairs and nearly landing in the creek. Smitty helped to break my fall and I thought it was going to snap in half. Luckily it was fine and I was fine no injury. I continued on and the trail rise steeply up iron mountain. I was about 1/2 mile in when the skies opened up and it poured. It continued to rain up and over the climb all the way to about 5 minutes of arriving at Hurricane Mt Shelter. When I arrived to the shelter it was full of weekend hikers. Sat under cover and tried to dry off, sign the log book and read it. I actually had cell service here and sent out a few texts. The last two days has been really bad with service and trying to post blog updates. I decided to push on to let things dry out again and to find a campsite. Well 5 miles later and several more rain showers I came to Virginia route 16. I was beat and was determined to find a campsite. After walking north on the AT finally a nice campsite appeared and I set up shop. I almost just laid down on the ground and went to sleep but thought what if it rains. Luckily this campsite was north of the rain so it was dry. I made dinner and was fishing around the food bag when I came across 3 nips that Chris Lovell had sent me in the package in Hampton TN. Baileys salted caramel, yes please. Boy was it nice to have a night cap for my aching bones. Jeff my husband is driving down tomorrow to see me. I'm so excited. This is the longest we have ever been apart since meeting one another almost 20 years ago. He is leaving from New York in the am and it's about a 10 hour drive.

I pushed off on trail about 9 and the first climb of the day was a steady up but not to bad. This mountain had no name in the book but was an 800 foot elevation gain. At the top I texted and called Jeff so we could agree exactly where to meet in case there was no cell service. I called my mom who was visiting in New Hampshire and Jeffs parents to get an update on the tropical storm and the timing. I headed the 2 miles down to trimpi shelter where I filtered water, had a snack, read, wrote in my paper journal, wrote in the log book. I killed some more time and pushed off again. The trail ascended some more passing through a field where the grass was chin high almost with the trail cutting through it. So cool. There were a couple more ups and downs but nothing to noteworthy. I did cross a road at one point and a long bridge over a creek the water looked so inviting as it was hot. I do remember the climb after the road had 8 false summits. You go up, up, up and think your almost there and then once on top you notice more up ahead. Finally reaching the summit I called Jeff to get an update. Then headed back down and arrived at Fellowship Shelter at 4:00. I walked over to the Mt. Rogers visitor center which was .20 miles away and arrived at 4:06 and they closed at 4pm. Argh!!!! So much for charging my phone. No cell signal here either. Let's hope Jeff finds me. I trudged back to the shelter and picked up trash. It makes me furious when thru hikers are careless and trash places. The shelter was like a log cabin with a loft area. On the right side of the shelter was a room which housed a cold shower. The inside of the shelter had 3 empty boxes of beer and trash scattered about and on the picnic table. It's this small % that ruin the good name of most thru hikers that are respectful, follow the rules, carry out more than what they carried in. I spent about 45 minutes cleaning up and walking trash to the dumpster on the other side of visitor center. I made 3 runs. Back at the shelter familiar faces started showing up. Waterfall and her guy, D3, Avalon, David. Bullet showed up and he started Springer on May 10. MAY 10!!!!! He's to where I am and I started April 6th holy crap he's literally running and his pack is 25 lbs. Crazy!! The visitor center has a phone outside their building where you can call local for shuttles and to have pizza delivered to the shelter. That's right it's the only place on the AT where you can get pizza delivered trail side. Waterfall her guy and I all ordered together. I got a large cheese and ate the whole thing. I chatted for awhile with everyone. At 7:30 I went and sat by the road as the visitor centers gates were closed. At 8:25 I saw the red Chevy cruise with New York plates coming up the road. OMG it has been almost 2 months since I've seen Jeff. It's the longest time we've ever been apart and it's been so hard. We drove to Bristol and got a room at the Marriot. Pool and hot tub.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535684,A day off today. Yay!! Of coarse I woke up at 6:30 am. I got up quietly and headed down to the pool and hot tub. I so was looking forward to soaking the sore body. I relaxed there for about an hour letting Jeff sleep. I got back to the room and we both showered got ready and went to breakfast at Cracker Barrel. After breakfast we headed over to Target so I could resupply on the items I needed. We headed back to the hotel and I organized all my supplies and repacked my food bag. We then headed back out and went to Walmart to buy Permetherin and to Cabella's so I could buy a new therma rest mattress. My REI blow up mattress had a slow leak and by the time I woke up each morning I was basically on the ground. After running to both stores it was time to eat again. Yay!!! I like food and we went to Golden Corral. After lunch we went back to the hotel and I took all my gear to the courtyard by the pool and sprayed it all with Permetherin. While it was drying we went into the pool and hot tub. We lounged outside on the chaise lounges afterward waiting for my gear to dry. At this point it was about 8pm and it was now time for dinner. We headed over to Chile's as I was graving guacamole. We crashed for the night at around 10 pm and it was really nice to basically do nothing.,"Mariott Hotel

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535839,"Jeff and I woke up around 8am and showered, packed and checked out of the hotel. We drove and had breakfast at Perkins. We then got on 81 and headed north back towards Marion. We arrived back at Mt Rogers visitor center around 11:30. After tearful hugs and goodbyes I walked back into the woods. Ugh that was so hard to do. I think harder then saying goodbye the first time on April 6th. I'm not sure if that was due to having trooper with me or not. Jeff is amazing as he drove 10 hours down from New York to I essence spend 24 hours with me to turn around and drive the 10 hours back to New York. I love him so much. Heading back into the woods the trail didn't waste time.. Up up up up. Within the first hour I crossed VA 622 and forest road 86. The big climb of the day was Glade Mt at 4113 ft. After the summit it was all downhill to Atkins. I stopped at Chatfield Shelter and at my turkey sandwich that Jeff and I bought at food city the night before. I met Google and treadless at the shelter. After my late lunch I continued on my way and crossed forest road 644. At this point it started to cloud over and I felt a drop. I took my pack off to put on my pack cover and gaitors and the heavens opened up. I just had enough time to get my pack cover on. It poured for a good 30 minutes and all there was to do was walki in the rain. I crossed VA 615 which was by an old one room school house called the Lindamood School. Right after the school I crossed VA 729 and went through a field. After the field there was a small wooden bridge where I sat to pour out about a cup of water from each boot. The rain let up and I continued on. The sun started to come out which helped to try and dry my soaked everything. The trail went up a ridge and you could see and hear I-81. I descended down the ridge slipping and falling on a wooden bridge. That's twice in a week I've wiped out. There was a set of railroad tracks to cross that the trail came to US 11 where I crossed and went to the Sunoco station across the street. I took my boots and socks or poured another cup of water out of my boots and sat in the sun to dry off. Luckily it hadn't rained at this location so everything was still hot and dry. I put my sandels on and went inside to buy a drink and a bag of chips. I finally got on my way walking another 2 miles. After leaving the Sumoco station I crossed underneath I-81 finally. I decided to make camp in a field near VA 617. Two other campers set up shop near me and I crawled into my tent to crash.","Mariott Hotel

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535967,"After I wrote lasts night blog from my tent I started to fall asleep when I heard a roar in the distance. It was rain. Normally this is no big deal but it came down hard and fast that a river formed and basically a pond started to form where I was tenting and two others. I jumped out of the tent and pulled the stakes out and tried dragging the tent to higher ground and trying to keep my stuff dry. The other two hikers did the same as the water was rising on all four sides of the tent. It wasn't quite dark yet and a car driving by must of saw the commotion in the field and either felt bad or had it happen to them once stopped and yelled do you want a place to stay. The three of us were like heck yea. We threw all of our gear and tents back into our bags and piled into the mini van and drove back to Marion. The other two hikers were treadless and I think she said her name was waterfall but it wasn't the same one I met before. We crashed in their family room and were able to take a shower. We dried our gear on their covered patio. We were so thankful. In the morning we got driven back on their way to work. Back on trail the first view I had was this massive field in the morning sun. I took a few pictures. Today there looked to be a lot of climbs. When I got to the end of the field I had my very first fence stile to go over. The best way to describe these is like a wide ladder. It usually is over a barbed wire fence and allows hikers to walk up over and back down the fence while keeping cattle in. They are a rather ingenious idea but if they are not built correctly or are at a crazy angle they can be challenging to get over. My first climb of the day was Guillion Mt. which was relatively a smooth trail with a moderate pitch. Second was Walker Mt which was very steep and rocky. At this point it was hot our so the climbing went slow as I didn't want to overheat. Coming down this section the trail goes into another field with more stiles. In all I had to go up snd over 12 of them today. I only almost killed myself on one when coming down my pack caught a step and was snagged almost causing me to dive off the stile.   At the bottom of the field was VA 610 where I sat on the side of the road and ate my lunch. The trail went back into a field on the other side of the road and climbed up through a bunch of cows. After about a mile the trail went back into the woods and 2 more stiles later it flattened out and descended again to VA 742 where the trail crosses a bridge. I stopped to filter water and rest. The trail then darted back into the woods climbing again arriving at another field. This time the trail went through the field ascending but with nice views all around. After a mile the trail went back into the woods climbing again steeply up to the summit of Brushy Mt. After the summit there was 1 mile to go before I reached Knot Maul Branch Shelter. I rested, filled out the log books and ate a snack. I was going to filter water but someone had scratched in the group spring dry. So instead of checking to see if it really was I figured I'd walk the .4 miles down trail to the next water source. The day was hot which I enjoyed but a lot of water needed to be drunk so a lot of water filtering needed to happen. After descending there was the climb up Lynn Camp Mt which was unforgiving and steep. It was slow going with the heat but finally I made it and started back down the other side. The trail descended and came across a US forestry road. I sat down and had a snack as my energy level was nil. As I was sitting I heard thunder in the distance. I had no cell signal to check radar so I put on my rain cover and gaiters. I boogied up the hill to try snd make the shelter which was only 4 miles away. The climb was steep and I quickly was running out of energy. The storm still seemed far away and I wasn't even sure if it was headed towards or away from my location. I was crawling up the chestnut knob when I was finally able to get radar. Two big storms were headed my way. I decided to not try to make the shelter. I don't mind walking in the rain but was afraid I'd get there rye shelter will be full and I'd be stuck putting my tent up in the rain. I decided the next available spot to camp I'm doing it. Of coarse there was no available place to camp for a mile. Finally about 2 miles from the shelter I see a fire ring.   I quickly get my tent out throw it up. Throw all of my gear in and it downpours. Phew!! Just in the nic of time. The batch of rain over me is going to last for hours. I'm glad I'm dry. Sleep time for me.","Stealth Campsite by VA 617

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536169,"The day of suck and boy did it suck. I woke up at 6am wet. Wet sleeping bag, wet pad, wet tent, wet everything. It poured so hard that water got between the tent and the base layer and soaked through during the night. I got up and ate a cold breakfast and then packed up all the wet gear. I got on trail about 7am. The climb was brutal like it was last night. I just thought it was because I was tired. Up up up for another two miles. I passed a group of three yellow lady slippers. I had never seen yellow before only pink. I took pictures and sent one to Leslie my plant specialist who I used to work with just to confirm. Wow!! So cool!! The trail broke into a grassy field but still climbed. After about a 1/2 mile I came to a pond with a spring on the north side of it. I filled up on water. It was only 8:30 am and it was hot. I kept climbing through 2 more fields when I came to Chestnut Knob Shelter. The shelter was a cinder block building with a door. It slept 8 and had a picnic table inside the shelter. You could of fit 30 people inside standing. If I had known that I would have pushed onto the shelter even though it was raining. However the fields and exposed ridge line in the thunderstorm might have been a bit harrowing. I stopped at the shelter had a snack and wrote in the log book. Virgil was there who I had met before the day Jeff picked me up at Mt Rogers. I didn't know his trail name though. He is section hiking and is doing about 300 miles this summer. I continued down the trail and the guidebook showed an easy 4 mile plateau. Well I should know better that this means 44 steep but short ups snd downs. They are so short the book shows it as a straight line. By mile 3 I was crawling and struggling. It was hot and I was trying to conserve water as there is none for a ten mile stretch and I was in it. Finally I made the last climb and was downhill to US 623 which is a dirt road with parking. I collapsed drank some water and ate my lunch. I tried to lay some of my stuff out in the sun to dry but planned on hanging my tent in the hot afternoon sun when I got to Jenkins shelter. After lunch I started back and had a climb up and out of the dirt road. This side was not to bad. I had several ups and downs along the ridges line and then got to the three mile downhill to Jenkins shelter. I was just about out of water and was trying to use it sparingly. Finally I arrived at the shelter and first filtered water. Once finished with that I took off my boots and put my sandels on. I started to pull out all my wet gear from my bag when I noticed it had started to cloud over. I moved my bag to the shelter and the heavens opened up. There was already a hiker at the shelter when I arrived napping but they quickly woke up with the rain. Then I heard thunder. Well this is going to be awhile. With nothing else to do I took out my sleeping pad and took a nap. Virgil arrived about 30 minutes later and then a south bounder who is doing a flip flop hike from Pennsylvania. After about an hour more the rain subsided and the sun came out. It was 4:30 and I pushed on. Where it was much later now I decided to head for Laurel Creek campsites than try and get to the next shelter. With all the pop up storms I did not want to get stuck. I already had a wet tent I didn't want to have to set it up in the rain. I didn't get a chance to dry it out with the afternoon rain. Ompi texted me saying the next stretch wasn't too bad and he had hitched a ride into Bland and missed the rain. He was about a mile from the next shelter which put him about 8 miles in front of me. I only had one climb to do and got at it. The climb itself wasn't too bad the mud made it super difficult. After about 1.5 miles I got up on top of the ridge line and the trail was flat for 2.5 miles. I took out my back up phone charger and plugged in my phone so it would be fully charged when I got to camp. It was down to 28%. I walked the 2.5 easy miles and pulled my phone out to check on the status of charging. The phone was at 30% and the charger was dead. At the hotel in Bristol when I was charging it, something seemed off. Now I know why. Ugh. I'm going to have to go into Bland to charge my phone. I don't like being in the woods with no battery. I could use my stove but with all the rain it has not been reliable for that. I kept on chugging and descended the mile down to Laurel creek. There were campsites across the dirt road. When I arrived a few other thru hikers were set up. None I had met before. I set up my tent which was soaked (boy this is gonna be fun to sleep in) then proceeded to make dinner. Chris Lovell had mailed me nips and I still had a Kahlua one left. I made 6 cups of hot water and made ramen, rice and coffee which I put the nip in. Great night cap Chris. Thank you!! Made the ending of the day nice.","Stealth Campsite on Chestnut Knob

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536315,"I slept in today and didn't get up until 7:30. Wohooo!! The tent dried through the night except for the part under my pad but overall it was mostly dry. I got up packed up and pushed off around 8 after eating a cold breakfast. The morning climb wasn't too bad it followed a bunch of switchbacks and I was at the top in no time. The trail than followed the side of the ridge for 6 miles. It stayed fairly level and was fantastic to walk. You could see out over the valley. Today was the day of the caterpillar. 90% of the trees including white pine were defoliated. The trail was littered with bits of leaf debris. It was like this all 18.8 miles with some areas worse than others. With the lack of leaves there were some fantastic views. The sound of light rain could be heard along the whole trail. At first I was confused as it was sunny out than I realized it was caterpillar poop. Ick!!!! After 6 miles the trail followed a dirt road for a mile to route 52. I had decided to go into the town of Bland to charge my phone and to pick up the resupply I needed. I started hiking hoping I would be able to hitch a ride. No such luck. I walked the 3 miles and saw the sign entering Bastian. Oh shit I went the wrong way. I thought Bland was west and it was easy. Jordan pulled over as he must of seen the look of distain on my face and asked if I needed a ride. I said I went the wrong way and really wanted to go to Bland. He said I'm going that way I'll take you. He had a 1952 Ford pick up. He was refurbishing it. It was his grandads. It's neat in the south you see much older cars in the north they get rotted out so fast with the salt. He dropped me off at the Sunoco station and they had a pizza/deli and seating inside. I ordered a cheeseburger combo and sat at a booth that had a plug up charge my phone. It didn't work so I went to a different one, that didn't work either. After the third plug I gave up. I guess they had the circuit breaker off so Thru hikers don't sit there all day taking up valuable seating. I ate my meal and walked up the street to Dollar general. After some moving of carts out front I found a plug. Success!! I went inside to purchase my resupply and then came back out and drank and ate while my phone charged. I was there for about an hour when a thunderstorm rolled through. I sat and watched. A nice lady named Susan Bowers came to the store, her license plate said ""hiker"" On her way out we chatted a bit about where I lived and what my trail name was and when I started. She felt bad as she had an appointment to go to or she would of driven me back to the trail. I said no worries. She left and apparently got on the phone and called the cavalry. A woman named Nami showed up and said I can give you a ride, Susan called me but I have to stop at the library first. I was like sure and thank you. While I was loading my bag another woman pulled in and was like oh Nami you got him good bye y'all. I felt like a celebrity. Nami took me back to the trail. We talked about plants and I told her I saw yellow lady slippers yesterday. She was really excited. She dropped me off and I thanked her and started walking. The trail followed 52 for a bit than followed a side road crossing over I-77 on a bridge. Then the trail dashed back into the woods and climbed sharply. There was another storm coming so I pushed to get up to the ridge line as fast as I could. The trail was slippery as it was I could only imagine what it would be like in pouring rain and I didn't want to find out. I made it to the side trail for the shelter which was .3 off trail. I ran down as the rain started to pour down. I made it to the shelter only slightly wet. Bear finder was there and we chatted while I waited for the rain to stop. She was finishing up her thru hike that she started last year. For school reasons she did Pennsylvania to Maine and then Pennsylvania to Virginia. This year she started at Springer and is 16 miles from finishing. Her parents are going to be at VA 606 doing trail magic waiting for her to get there. So in the morning there should be trail magic. Wohooooo. The rain let up and I continued on. The trail followed a ridge with ups and downs but nice ones. Not like the stretch from Chestnut knob but the trail looks similar in the guidebook. I guess you never know. I came to a dirt road and bumped into waste management. This was my 5th encounter with him and I keep forgetting to mention him. He is 70 and is section hiking north using his jeep and a moped. He hikes south but leaps forward with the vehicle he comes to at a road crossing. Then he drives that vehicle north to the next road and walks south to get to his vehicle and does it again. His jeep has a bike hitch he can put the moped on if need be. It's a smart way to do it. He gave me a bunch of water and I said I'll see you tomorrow I'm sure. I walked a bit and bumped into spam and her boyfriend camping. I said hi. I walked another 3 miles and hit the 600 mile mark. So exciting. At this point it was getting dark so I threw on my head lamp for the last 3 miles to Jenny knob shelter. When I arrived at 9:30 the guys in the shelter were still up and there was room for me. Yay!! I knew there were big storms coming and didn't want to pack up a wet tent in the morning. I crashed almost instantly.","Laurel Creek

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536514,"I woke up today squeezed in between whitecap and nooner. Purple mist and optimist were also in the shelter to my tight. I slept kind of rough last night. First the storms came through about midnight which woke me up. Then I was consciously trying not to snore or move around to much so I didn't wake up the guy on either side of me which I think caused me to not go into deep sleep. The nice thing about sleeping in a shelter is its so easy to get up and go in the morning. No tent to pack up and if you arrive late night and are so exhausted that all you unpack is your pad and bag it makes it that much easier. I got on trail at 7:30 and it was foggy but super humid. I would take a guess the dew point was in the mid 60's. I hiked for about 2 miles and came across David who had is hammock set up near the road and creek. This is the David from the Avalon/Gretel group. He had gotten separated from the group when he had to go into town. I said did you read the log at Jenny knob. Avalon left you a message saying to go to Woods Hole Hostel. He said he got the message and I moved on. I crossed VA 608 and had the first big climb of the day. Walking about 6 miles from Jenny Knob I came up behind purple mist who was still taking it slow after recovering from an injury. She lives in Virginia with her husband optimist who was a bit ahead of us. We walked and talked about our hikes for about 30 minutes. The trail dropped down and crossed over a suspension bridge over Kimberling Creek. It was a really neat bridge. On the other side of the bridge I saw a man with tape and a sign saying trail magic! I said you must be bear finders dad. He said you heard, well please eat a ton of food. They had sodas, Gatorade, gallon jugs of water, all kinds of chips, subs (turkey, ham, roast beef) cake that read congrats bear finder. It was awesome for 10am. I stayed and ate for a half hour and then moved on. I saw Gretel, chef, blue hawk as well as detour who I haven't seen since walking down the big hill into hot springs. Purple mist and optimist were also there. The clan asked me if I had seen David. I said yes he was at a campsite near the last road crossing. I asked where Avalon was and they told me she had gotten up at 7 and pushed off. They had camped nearby but didn't get up very early. I said thank you and goodbye and moved on. Gretel, chef and bluehawk passed me when I was switching to trekking poles from the walking stick. Ompi had texted me saying the trail from VA 606 to Wapitti shelter was mud all 6 miles. When I got to the downhill I thought it best to have the trekking poles. I was behind the three of them and we all took a side trail to dismal falls. I ate a snack and the three of them went in swimming. I debated going but my gaitors were covered in mud and I needed to boogie if I was gonna make the 21 miles to meet Ompi at Woods hole hostel. I yelled to the three have fun I'm moving on. The trail for the next 7 miles was relatively flat but muddy. It made it really hard to walk. It felt like you were stepping on ice as when you stepped on the ground your foot would slide either left or right. I finally made it to Wapiti shelter where I was gonna have a snack and use the privy. When I arrived some man had is hammock set up in the shelter. I was like ok that's odd not to mention you've taken up the whole shelter. I was only there for 20 minutes. He wasn't too chatty. 7.2 miles away from shower, bed and laundry!! Wohooo. What lay ahead of me was a 2 mile steep climb up another mt with no name. I seem to be at a stretch where the trail goes up to these 3800-4000 foot peaks with no views and no name. The climb was tough as I was exhausted. It looked like rain was coming and it had sprinkled a bunch already. Finally I made it to the top. I checked radar, rain was most certainly coming. There was a text from Ompi. Moving on from Woods Hole Hostel. They are out of water. No showers, no laundry. Nooooooooooo!!! I had been daydreaming about the shower all day. He said he was gonna push and camp just outside of pearisburg and did we want to split a room. I was like hell yes! He told me the royal couple are only 3 days ahead. OMG Sarah and Simon I have missed you guys. Sarah got back from the UK and Simon hiked through skipping trail days. Simon passed all of our locations while we were at trail days so now he is ahead. Sarah met up with Simon in Damascus about 2 weeks ago. So we need to catch them. The RC (royal couple from now on) said the Chinese AYCE (all you can eat) was fantastic. Ompi and I are gonna meet there tomorrow before we check into hotel. So now I'm sitting on top of this mountain with 4 miles to go before I get to the hostel with no water. Ugh what to do now as that plan is out the window. I decided to go for the next shelter. Which was 7 miles from my location. I dragged myself there. The last 4 miles I thought I was gonna drop. My legs burned and felt like rubber. The last climb in the book looked rough. I sat at the bottom near the waterless hostel and ate everything in my food bag for energy. I started the climb and as luck would have it the climb was so much easier than what the guidebook showed. Phew. When I arrived at Docs Knob Shelter there was only one person in the shelter. Score for me. I added up my mileage for the day and realized I had done 24. Gosh no wonder why I felt dead. Tomorrow I meet up with Ompi in Pearisburg.","Jenny Knob Shelter

Whitecap, Lois and Clark tented nearby. The shelter only had myself and another woman in it. I never found out her name as I got there when she was asleep and left before she was up. I quickly ate a cold breakfast and got on my way by 6:30. I had 8 miles to go before I would reach town. The terrain was fairly easy. Basically it was flat or slightly down. The only climb was the short up to Angels Rest. I reached the big downhill into town at 9am and had a 2.5 mile steep downhill. I got into town at about 10. Ompi was sitting in front of the motel as he had made a reservation last night. He was sitting waiting for the room to be cleaned. We were able to get into the room around 10:30. We both took showers. I walked across the street to buy a shirt and shorts at Goodwill across the street so I could get laundry done. Ompi showered first and I went second. After I was done I said to him remind me I need to go to the post office before 4 to get the package Jeff sent me which was the backup battery charger for my phone. Ompi said to me uhm it's Saturday how late is the post office open. I looked in the guide book and it said noon. It was 11:53 and we both looked at each other and ran. I made it in time and was able to get my charger. Yay! After the post office we walked back towards the motel and had lunch across the street at a Mexican restaurant. We had nachos, burritos, enchiladas and margaritas. Yum. After lunch we headed back to the room to gather our laundry and have that done by the motel staff. I dumped out my whole bag and went through that and organized and replaced zip loc bags etc. Ompi napped and I got sucked into a tornado documentary. It was a lazy day of doing nothing. At around 5 we headed next store to the other motel and saw a whole bunch of familiar faces. Gai, Gretel, free fall, Chef, spam. Pretty much the entire bubble I hiked with the last two weeks was here at both motels. Ompi and I then headed to AYCE Chinese food. I have been dreaming about this for weeks. It was really good. With Chinese it could go either way and we lucked out. After dinner we headed back to the motel to call family and friends and just veg.

I finally got up and showered. Ompi followed suit and we ran over to Food Lion for a small resupply. Ompi only needed tortillas and I needed a bit more. I checked out and walked over to the motel. Ompi had gone to Hardee's and bought us breakfast. 4 bacon egg n cheese biscuits. That was such a nice surprise. We organized and packed up and checked out of the motel. Ompi headed out as he came into town a bit further up the trail. I stopped in Dairy Queen and got an iced coffee and wanted to let my phone charge some more. I started on the side road back to the road about 11:30. The first part back on the trail was super muddy. It was so bad I was holding onto trees trying not to fall down. I crossed lane street where Ompi originally got off trail yesterday. The trail went up a bit passed a cemetery and then back down to US 460 where I crossed the Senator Shumate Bridge. The trail went down a set a stairs and under the a bridge and into the woods. It rose sharply for a mile and came back down to Landfill Road. There were signs do not drink the creek water. After following the trail back up steeply again you see why. The creek comes directly out of the landfill. Ick. The climb was about 2 miles up and then descended shortly to VA 642. It then went back into the woods crossing private property for 600 feet before rising sharply for 3 miles to Rice Field Shelter. The sky looked of rain and it rained intermittently as I was hiking. My plan was to stop at the shelter for a late lunch and then push on. When I arrived at the shelter Ompi was there and had set up his hammock as he wasn't sure if there would be bad storms or not. I looked at the radar as I had service and saw a line of storms coming. I decided to set up in the shelter and not risk getting poured on, hail, wind and lighting not to mention the risk of having to set up in the rain. There are about 7 others here and we all are relaxing making dinner. It was an easy 7.2 miles but still 7.2 closer to Maine. Tomorrow will be a big mile day.","Pearisburg

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537077,"Last night we had the most epic sunset. The colors went until about 9:40. It made us feel like we were given something worthwhile for stopping so early. We missed the storms and it only rained for 3 minutes. So almost all of us were like ugh we should of kept walking. We only did 7.2 miles that day. I guess it's better to be safe than sorry. A bunch of us also got up at 5:30 to watch the sunrise. The shelter is up on the summit and there was a grassy bald with open views to the west, north and east. The south side was covered with trees and that is where the shelter was. The sunrise was not nearly as nice as the sunset. We ate breakfast and started to pack up when the fog rolled in. Good thing we we were able to get the sunrise in before that happened. I pushed off about 7:00 and the goal was 24 miles to warspur shelter. The RC (royal couple) is only 2 days ahead of us and Sarah is back from the UK. Simon stayed on trail when Sarah went back to visit her dying grandfather. Simon did not go to trail days and passed all of our locations where we got off for trail days. Sarah met up with Simon in Damascus and we were all behind them. Ompi told me they are not too far ahead when I saw him in Pearisburg so we decided to try and catch them. The group at the shelter were fantastic last night. I bunch of familiar faces from the smokies were there. Sea sharp, 2.0, sunshine were just some of the people there. The trail in the morning followed the ridge line for about 5 miles before we got to any climb. Most of us stopped for water 2 miles out and again for a late morning snack. It was kind of nice to meet up with people during the day. The last two weeks I've been hiking alone and gave seen no one. I'm glad I'm out of that bubble for now. I stopped at Pine Swamp Branch shelter for a snack. There was a note in the trail that read: This is Spam, I left my I-phone in a purple case on the picnic table at the last shelter 12 miles back. If you have it or know about it please stop at the shelter I'm waiting here. I got to the shelter and told Spam I saw it on the table last night and Ompi asked me who's phone is that. We though it was one of the other hikers and I didn't think anything of it. It was still on the table in the morning and I left before they did maybe Ompi or Sea Sharp have it. About 12 minutes later Sea Sharp rolled in with the save as he recognized the case and took it with him hoping to bump into Spam. The whole group from last nights shelter rolled into the shelter for a rest break. We all pushed on and headed for the ""Captains"". The captains is a private residents home who invites hikers in to camp in his yard and if raining to use his back porch for shelter to sleep. He provides an outlet to charge your devices. He has 4 picnic table and a fire ring. It's not a hostel so there is no going inside, or bathrooms. He has free cold drinks in the fridge on the porch and has a wireless password. It was such a nice place to stop and have lunch. It was only 2 and we weren't going to camp but the property was beautiful and well manicured. The best part is it's right on a creek and you have to take a zip line to get to it. You flip your bag onto a ring and sit on a seat and zip across. It was pretty damn cool. We called it air blazing. On trail we have nick names for movement on trail. Blue blaze= side trail not apart of the AT. Yellow Blaze= taking a vehicle around a part of the trail. Aqua blaze= kayaking or canoeing around a section of trail. Air blaze= taking a zip line. For the record I have not skipped any section of the trail. I'm one of those people that walk the same way out from the way I came in from a shelter do I don't miss the tiny piece in front of the shelter. I want to make sure I walks very piece. I'm what they called a purist. I also haven't slack packed yet but I'm sure when I get north and Peter (Jeff's dad) is close that might change. Ompi and I left and carried on. We had 8.8 miles to get to our goal of warspur shelter. We had a brutal 2 mile climb up to Bailey Gap shelter and I was crawling by the top. We rested with 2 other hikers. Then pushed on stopping for more water 2 miles later. We finally made it to the top of Lone Pine Peak and all we had was a 2.5 mile walk downhill. The last 2.5 mile walk was endless. It went on and on and on. We were dragging. Ompi's knees were starting to kill him so Aleve was popped promptly. We finally rolled into the shelter at 9:15 with just barely enough light to see. The shelter and surrounding areas were packed. We were like what the hell. I would say 30 people. Apparently we caught a bubble. I found a tent spot and took off my boots. Ompi unfortunately could not find a good spot to set up his hammock so said he was gonna go down the trail and would see me in the morning. I set up, made dinner and zonked. We did 25.4 miles today. Holy crap!!","Rice Fields Shelter 
",Warspur Shelter,"Jun 06, Mon",25.40
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537244,"I will get to the explanation for the title a bit later. I zonked last night. I mean passed out instantly once getting into my tent. I guess a 25 mile day hiking will do that to you. I woke up around 7:30 got up and made breakfast. I ate while writing my journal entry and packed up. I got on trail about 9am which is kind of late for me. After the first 2 miles I did not see Ompi so he must of already got packed up and was on his way. The first climb of the day was Kelly's Knob. The climb started out ok but there was a one mile stretch that was steep and several rest breaks were needed. I dropped my pole which disappeared in all the tall green plants on the side of the trail. I reached in to find my pole then realizing they were stinging nettles. Ouch!! I reached the top of Kelly Knob and there was a view where I had s snack. Spam and her guy where coming up the side trail as I was coming back from the view. I asked if they had seen Ompi and they said no. He must be ahead of me then. I moved on climbing down to the next shelter which was Laurel Creek. When I got there it was lunch time so I ate while reading the log. Ompi was there at 10 am and was headed for the shelter we both agreed to shoot for which was 18.2 miles. Wow if he was there at 10 that means he got on trail by 7am. How the heck did he do that as I was still dead to the world. I moved on and the trail passed through a few fields which were really pretty. After the fields and before the next big climb we passed by Keffer Oak which is the biggest oak on the AT and its about 300 years old. I thought Dover Oak in New York was bigger but maybe it's the oldest Oak tree on the AT. Next the big climb began up Sinking Creek Mountain. The climb up was another fought with very steep pitches and loose soil. It turned into switchbacks which made for a much easier go of it but the beginning was pure hell. Finally I made it to the ridge line and followed that for 6 miles. There was a shelter up top which was 1/2 mile off trail. I didn't need to stop so I kept moving on. The ridge climbed over some rock ledges with some great views. It down poured for about 2 minutes. It was just enough time to get my pack cover on and it stopped. There was rain north of my location but it should miss. The random downpour was just for fun. It was partly sunny too when it happened and there was a rainbow but not well enough visible to take a picture. I began the climb down to Niday shelter which was about a 3 mile walk from the top of the ridge. About 1/2 mile from the shelter I reached into my side pocket for water. As I was doing so I was like wrong side that's the one that is empty. However my hand was where the bottle should of been and no bottle. It must of fallen out on the way down. Oh no ugh. I walked back for a bit and didn't see it. It could be anywhere in the 3 mile stretch. I kept moving on and hoped someone would bring it if they saw it in the trail. Just like Spam's I-phone from yesterday. When I got to the shelter Ompi had finished dinner and was packing up. He said he was gonna try and get to the top of the next mountain so we didn't have so many climbs. I said good idea but didn't know what to do about my water bottle. I decided at least to filter and fill the bottle I have and wait to see if anyone shows up with it. When I got back from filtering Ompi had got his shoes on. He said that either way we both would still go to the same shelter tomorrow so if I decided to stay the night at the shelter no biggie. He pushed on and I sat filling out the log book. I told myself I would wait an hour and if it didn't show up most likely no one saw it. At the shelter there was a pastor, 4 seniors who has just graduated and two other guys. I think all that were there were the same group from the same church doing a section hike. They were from Ohio. The pastor said let me give you this extra Nalgeen water bottle as I don't need it right now. I was most appreciative and told him if my bottle shows up he can keep it as an AT memory. I can't for the life of me remember his name as my hiker brain is in a fog. I told him about my trail journal if he was interested in following along. Pastor if you are reading this THANK YOU again for being so kind and offering me your water bottle. I wonder if mine showed up if so message me on here and let me know. Did you keep it? Do you want yours back? I can mail it. The pastor also gave me a meat bar and a cliff bar. The trail provided for me again when I was in need. 7pm hit and no one had come to the shelter from the trail. I got up and said goodbye to everyone and pushed on. The first 2 miles were easy and then we got to climb three. I took my phone out and out my headphones in and played some upbeat music to get myself up the hill. 3/4 of the way up I came across Ompi who said I'm dead and can't go on anymore so I stopped here. We were in a neat spot, which was a narrow ridge. I found a spot to set up my tent. Organized made dinner and now ready to pass out. Tomorrow we are hiking to just near Mcaffe Knob which is the most recognized part of the trail in my opinion. It's the lion king like outcrop where people stand out looking over the valley. I just realized I will be reaching this spot a year to the date that Al Cratty died from cancer. He was the original owner of smitty (the walking stick). I am carrying this stick as a tribute to AL who always wanted to walk the AT but died before he got the chance. This is his last hike and I have the pleasure of taking him on it, smitty that is. I find it fitting that I will be at Mcaffe on the anniversary of his pasting. Tomorrow I am gonna try and get into a town. We cross a road that leads to a grocery. I need a bit more food as its getting tight. The royal couple are within our reach.","Warspur Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537359,"Woke up today on the ridge line on bushy mountain and boy was it chilly with gusty winds. I got up and packed up as Ompi was already up. We both got on trail at 6:30 and left together. We were mostly up Brushy Mt and only had a short distance to go to the ridge line. There was a view point from the top which we didn't stay at for long as the winds were howling. The hike down bushy mt. seemed to take forever I mean forever. At the bottom we had to fill up on water as it was the only place for 10 miles. We pushed on making the climb up to dragons tooth. We met Jessie's Girl on the way up and she was the woman who I spent the night in the shelter with before Pearisburg. I finally got her trail name and she said Storm is this the guy you were trying to catch. The climb wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. Many switchbacks helped in that department. We skipped the shelter that was 1/2 mile off trail. We made it to Dragons tooth and it was a really neat rock formation. We had our lunch there and made the climb down which was a ledge scramble. There were even metal handles to assist. It was a really neat climb down. Some points were a little hairy and I was thankful not to be doing this in the rain. It was slow going but we finally arrived at VA 624. A .40 mile walk west on the road brought us to a gas station that had beer, ice cream, pizza, soda, chips. Ompi and I ran. There was a plug outside so we charged our electronics while we gorged ourselves. We met salsa outside who was also doing the same thing. She started on March 24th and has been taking her time and had a week off while the recovered from an injury. We were at the gas station for about an hour. We suited back up walking the .40 back to the trail. We had one climb immediately after leaving the road but with switchbacks it wasn't too bad. We then descended down and follows a creek for awhile then into fields for about 2 miles. We then climbed the end of the field sharply back into the woods where we made it to a ridge line and followed that for awhile. I was in the lead and a big gust of wind knocked over a dead tree across the trail a bit in front of me. Eeeek falling trees oh my! We descended down the ridge and arrived at US 311 where there was a big parking lot for Mcaffe Knob which was about 3.5 miles away. From this parking lot we had 2 miles to go before getting to Catawaba Mountain Shelter. The climb wasn't too bad until the very end when we just wanted to get there. We finally arrived at 8:30 and Jessie's girl was the only one at the shelter. I set up in the shelter and Ompi set up his hammock close by. We made dinner and are crashing. We are planning on getting up at 4am to watch the sun rise from Mcaffe Knob. To me Mcaffe Knob is the most pictured part of the AT in movies and on TV. I find it strange I will be getting to this big milestone for me on the one year anniversary of the passing of Al Cratty who was the original owner and carver of Smitty. Tomorrow I'm going to do a tribute for Al and hopefully get some great pictures. For now I gotta sleep if I'm getting up in 6 hours. Also tomorrow we make it to Troutville to catch up to the RC (Royal couple) which I haven't seen since Gaitlinburg.","Stealth campsite on Bush Mt.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537540,"Today marks the one year anniversary of the death of Al Cratty. His son Kirk and I went to college together. Al loved the AT. He wanted to Thru hike it someday and walked most of the Maine section. He was a trail angel to thru hikers in Maine. He never was able to thru hike before his death due to cancer. His son Kirk asked me when he found out I was going to thru hike if I could do him a favor. His dad carved s walking stick from wood he found on the trail in Maine. He used this walking stick on all of his hikes. Kirk asked me if he overnighted the walking stick would I be willing to bring it to Georgia and leave it on Springer Mountain in hopes people use it and walk it from shelter to shelter. I said sure and when I received the walking stick I said to myself I can't just leave this on the summit. So it's been with me for over 700 miles and is called Smitty. Today we woke up at 4am so we could watch the sunrise at Mcaffe Knob. I found it ironic that on the anniversary of Al's death I would be at the most photographed spot on the AT. We got up packed up in the dark and got on trail at 4:30. The climb up to Mcaffe knob was not nearly as steep as the book showed. We arrived at 5:30 and took some fantastic pictures of the sky and of ourselves. I actually sat on the edge and got a photo of my legs hanging off the edge. The sunrise was spectacular. We continued on heading down the knob to the Cambell Shelter to fill up on water and have breakfast. After we ate we continued on following the ridge line which would take us to Tinker Cliffs which were about a three mile walk. The climb right before the cliffs was steep and Ompi and I took our time. The morning fire by though as we were deep in conversation while we were walking. The cliffs were amazing views that looked back toward Mcaffe knob. Ompi received a text from free fall that my water bottle was at 4 pines hostel. Spam and Sniper had found it on trail and recognized it as mine because of the Catskill Center stickers and the trail conference stickers. They were staying at 4 pines hostel but were getting off trail for a wedding. Free fall knew I was hiking with Ompi and texted to find out where I was. He was getting a shuttle to the outfitter here in Daleville and we asked if he could bring my water bottle and leave it at the checkout and I would pick it up later. He said no problem. Yay my water bottle lives on. After Tinker Cliffs we had about 8 miles to go before hitting town. The trail followed the ridge line with a bunch of small ups and downs. It started to get hot but it was nice after the cool weather we have been having. We stopped a few times for snack and to eat a quick lunch. We were originally going to camp in Troutville as the town park lets you camp on the edge of the park and there is free showers and laundry at the fire station. Ompi texted the Royal couple to see if they wanted to split a room at the Howard Johnson. They were in and it was exciting to think of a bed, food, shower and the Royal couple. We continued to push on and started our descent down into Dakeville. We met tank along the way as well as lightning. They both watched the sunrise from Mcaffe Knob this morning. The trail takes you through wooded flatlands and you can hear the traffic suddenly you plop out of the woods into the chaos of the real world. It was almost disorienting at first. Semi trucks whizzing by, horns honking, road construction in the distance. Noise, noise, noise. The Howard Johnson was immediately to our right when we popped out of the woods. We found the Royal couple and were very excited to catch back up with them. Ompi and I showered, threw our clothes in the laundry and sat by the pool while the laundry was running. We got into town at about 2:45. When the laundry was finished we headed over to the flying mouse brewery and had a beer. The motel has a BBQ spot so after the brewery we stopped at Krugers and bought stuff to grill. We had hot dogs, steak, burgers, corn on the cob, sausage, chips, cold drinks. I ran into the outfitter to see if my water bottle was there. The guy working behind the counter was like I know nothing. He didn't really look or go out back so I'm not sure. We texted free fall to check to see I he made it to rush and dropped off the water bottle. We got back to the motel and grilled up a storm. Good times. By 9:30 everyone was ready for bed and we quickly passed out. Hadn't heard from free fall yet by the time we fell asleep so I will swing by the store again in the morning.","Catawba Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537659,"Woke up in the motel at around 6:30. When you split a room with 4 people it's super cheap. Ompi was already up and had left the room to work on his blog. The Royal couple and myself got up showered, dressed and headed to the free continental breakfast. We gorged ourselves on bagels, waffles, cereal, eggs, doughnuts and muffins. Plus plenty of juice and coffee. After breakfast we headed back to the room to pack up. I ran down to the grocery store to do a small resupply. I also stopped in at the outfitter to ask again about my Nalgeen. The staff ran around looking out back, under the desk. I looked in the hiker box on the off chance that it may have been tossed in there. No luck. The staff hadn't seen it. I'm not 100% sure even if Free fall brought it to the outfitter or he got a shuttle to a different outfitter and it's somewhere else. A bunch of us texted him yet have not heard back. I walked back to the motel and we all packed up. We left the motel at 10:30 and we're back on the trail after crossing route 11. We walked the 1.5 miles to the next road and stopped so I could go pick up my package and Slosh could go mail home their winter gear. Ompi and Scavenger stayed with the packs. It is about 40 minutes to walk the .70 mile to the post office and back. We continued on the trail. We had a pretty good size climb coming out of Daleville and Troutville. Coming out of town always sucks as your pack is heavy and the climb is steep. We had 3 miles to go to get to Fullhardt Knob Shelter where we were going to stop and have lunch. It was nice to hike with a group. This was my first time in 700 miles I hiked with a group. We didn't stay completely together but were close. We had lunch and continued on. The climb went downhill for awhile and we stopped for water at the creek at the bottom of the climb. After our water break we had a real steep climb to the ridge and then back down the other side. The trail right now is going up the ridge and back down the other side. We did this 4 times on 4 different ridges. We finally arrived at Wilson Creek shelter at about 6:30. This was an early end to the day but on leaving town days it seems to make sense doing it this way. We set up camp and made dinner. We were all pretty exhausted and got ready for bed about 8:30. The plan is for me to shoot for 17 miles and there is a swimming hole and a campground. Ompi has a package waiting for him there. We may camp there or push on. The Royal couple may shoot for the same distance. As of 8:30 neither Ompi or myself have heard back from free fall about my water bottle. I hope he is ok as I find it weird no one has heard from him. It's lights out.","Daleville Howard Johnsons

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537866,"I woke up around 6:30 but decided to fall back asleep. I was beat and didn't hear anyone else in camp up yet. I got up not to much longer and we got on trail by 7:30. Scavenger and Slosh (the Royal couple) left first followed by Ompi then myself. We could tell it was going to be a hot day. We all hiked separately but kept leap frogging over one another. We walked about 5 miles following the side of the hill and came to mile 97 on the Blue Ridge Parkway. It was the first time we have crossed over the parkway on our journey. The trail at this point follows the Parkway for about 100 miles. Sometimes the trail is very close to the parkway and you can see it through the trees and sometimes you are further away near roads that lead to the parkway. We continued on another few miles and the trail lead to a parking area with a view. The most exciting thing about this parking area is it had a trash barrel. We cheered and started emptying out our trash. Some more Thru hikers came out to the parking area and cheered when they saw the trash barrel. You wouldn't think this would be a big deal but following leave no trace you carry out everything you carry in. This does not mean burn it in the fire pit. When you have gone several days you can acquire a bit of trash and it's nice when you can unload it. We continued on stopping at Bobblets Shelter to fill up on water. We had a stretch of 11 miles with no water. It was going to be hot so we needed to be cautious about water. We crisscrossed the Blue Ridge Parkway a few times. The RC was ahead of me on our last road crossing for the day. When I crossed the road and caught up to them on the trail by the road they were stopped. When I arrived I saw why they were stopped. Across the trail was a 3 foot long rattle snake. I have only seen a rattlesnake once and this was a small brown one. This snake was huge and very green in color. We stood and waited while it looked at us and went nowhere. Finally it rattled its tail and slowly moved off trail. We took pictures and video of it cause what else were we gonna do while standing there. We were finally able to move on and warned two section hikers going south bound to be wary. They were thankful and gave us Reese's Peanut Butter Cups for the warning. We walked on and crossed over VA 43 and the Blue Ridge Parkway was only .20 miles east. The trail at this point banged a sharp uphill. Normally not to bad but in this case it was very hot and the trail was in the open sun and it was 1pm. I was first followed by the RC and the Ompi. When all four of us reached Cove Mt Shelter we looked pretty haggard and felt like we were gonna drop. It was a tough section and we were trying to conserve water as the shelter had no water and we still had 3 miles to go before water. At the shelter we saw Jessie's Girl again who was at the shelter we stayed at last night. She was having her lunch, which was what the rest of us were about to do. We had passed three woman day hiking with a collie and they arrived at the shelter. Come to find out one of the woman had hiked last summer from the West Virginia border to Katahdin and blew out her knee when she went back to leap frog and finish so she is now doing sections. Today her and two friends were doing a ten mile section. They stopped and has their lunch with one of the offering me a hard boiled egg. Oh boy what a treat. This reminds me that when Ompi and I were doing the marathon to catch the RC we were at Dragons Tooth and there was a group of day hikers there. They were talking to us about our hike and I told them a story how I was approaching a road crossing and a caravan pulled in and it looked like trail magic was being set up. I kinda got excited and as I got closer I realized it was just a hiker getting dropped off and they were pulling stuff out of the trunk to get the pack out. Then when I realized I was like oh (sad face). I then proceeded to tell them I never fully understood what hiker hunger was until about 4 weeks ago. One of the guys proceeded to go through his bag and come back and hand us home made teriyaki beef jerky. We were excited. Ompi leaned over and said good job on the Yogiing. I was like wow I did do my first real Yogiing. Yogiing is just like the cartoon yogi bear you see day hikers and or picnickers and you try and get something out of them by telling them how hungry you are or how hot it is. Some people take it to the extreme in my case I wasn't even trying and got something for my efforts. Ok back to today..... The ladies finished up their lunches and left. We were discussing the idea of splitting and staying at one of the cabins at the middle creek campground. Ompi had a resupply package to pick up there anyway she with the heat the cabin had AC. We inquired and they told us the cabin was 45 for 2 people. Each additional person was 25 dollars. Uhm that would be 95 dollars and 2 cabins would be 90. We got the feeling they didn't want to rent the cabins to thru hikers so we decided we would walk the remaining 3.2 miles to Jennings Creek and camp. There was a supposed swimming hole and Ompi could walk up and get his package. We finished up our lunches and pushed on. The day got hotter and the temperature was 94 in Buchanan with a heat index of 101 according to the weather App on my phone. Finally I could hear water in the distance and the trail dumped us out onto VA 614. I was the first to get there and crossed the street went down the small hill, dropped my pack, yanked off my shirt, pulled of my boots and basically dove into the water. The day bathers must of thought I was a mad man but I was hot and stunk. I looked up and saw Ompi crossing the bridge over to the parking area he looked down at me and laughed. That didn't take long he said. I came out of the water grabbed my things and headed over to the parking area where a thru hikers parents were doing trail magic. They missed their son and wanted to see him so they drove 5 hours down and are going to drive the 5 hours back tonight. They had cold drinks, hot dogs, burgers, watermelon, brownies. OMG it was heaven after the day we had. I gorged myself that I didn't even need to have dinner. We got to the trail magic at 5pm and it was perfect timing fit dinner. We thanked the couple profusely and walked from the parking area down a path to a bunch of campsites along the creek. We set up camp and I went with Ompi to the campground to pick up his package and I wanted to do a small resupply for lunches. We walked the 1.5 miles to the campground and without a pack it was a breeze. We picked up what we needed and one of the workers at the camp store offered to give us a ride back. We got back to camp and relaxed while Scavenger and Slosh had a lite dinner. When Ompi and I were walking to the campground we passed the couple doing trail magic who was packing up to leave. They said we have 4 hot dogs and a burger left that we are gonna trash if it doesn't get eaten. So Ompi and I could not let that happen. When we got back we were so full we couldn't eat a thing. We are all about to crash. Staring at us first thing in the morning is a climb from 951 feet here at the creek to 2054 feet in 1.6 miles. That's gonna be fun first light but I guess get it out of the way before it gets too hot. Tomorrow is going to be hotter than today but the saving grace is that we have plenty of water.","Wilson Creek Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537966,"We all woke up around 6:15 this morning and packed up and ate our breakfast. We knew the day was going to be hot and we had big climbs. We started the day at 951 feet and we were going to end the day at 4200 feet. Now the climbs we had to do were not a steady up but a series of ups and downs. 7 to be exact with each time not having us drop as much as the prior. We started our first incline and that went to 2300 feet in 1.2 miles. We rested at the top and then made our descent to the shelter which was 5.5 miles from our starting point. We filtered water and had a snack and met Nemo who was doing a flip flop and now hiking south. She had done other sections before but was now hiking south to Hot Springs. We continued on and had our first section climb of Apple Orchard Mountain. It was a steep up and the day was getting warm. I took my time and stopped often. Ompi was ahead of me and the Royal couple was behind. We would ascend steeply and then descend, then ascend steeply then descend. We passed some day hikers who said watch out for several rattle snakes a mile ahead. I never saw them but was quite anxious for the next mile after the behemoth rattler I saw yesterday. About a mile before Cornelius Creek Shelter Ompi caught up to me and said Scavenger had an idea. Why don't we stop at the next shelter and eat lunch then take a 2.5 hour siesta while the heat of the day passes and then hike into the night. I was like its a genius idea and that is exactly what we did. Several other hikers followed suit after we arrived. Some moved on but some lounged waiting for the heat of the day to subside. We got up and packed by 3:30 and moved on. I left first and then Ompi and then the RC. I checked out Black Rock Overview which was a nice vista. I had cell reception at this point and got texts through from family letting me know about the shootings in Orlando Florida. It was horrible news to hear and I felt for the families of all those involved. I moved on and began the final big climb up. It wasn't as steep as the morning but it seemed to go on and on. Finally I created over the top of Apple Orchard Mountain through a field. In the distance you could see a FAA radar tower and the trail passed to the side of it and back down. The trail descended down through some rock scrambles and I arrived at the guillotine. The guillotine is a small passage between two rock outcrops, there is a large rock wedged between the two rock outcrops. It looks like a guillotine about ready to drop on you. In about 1/2 mile I crossed back over the Blue Ridge Parkway and Thunder Ridge Shelter suddenly appeared. We had seen signs that this shelter was closed due to bear issues. However at the shelter the signs we saw prior down the trail were not here. In the log the ridge runner said the shelter is now open and the issue had been taken care of. Ompi showed and we decided that it was time to set up camp. We only did 14 miles but with the steep climbs and the heat of the day it was good enough for us. The RC showed and cheered that the shelter was open as they were dead. We set up our tents and Ompi made a killer fire. Black gnats are out and a nuisance and the fire moved them away. Tomorrow I need to hitch a ride into town to collect my package at the post office or ask to have it sent forward. We will see what time it is when I get to that road crossing.","Jennings Creek Campground

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538050,"Woke up this morning and boy was it cold. We all were up at 5:45 am because it was so freaking cold. I would have to take a guess it was in the high 40's. We filtered water, ate breakfast and packed up while the wind howled. We were camped on thunder ridge which is close to 4000 feet. Normally in mid June it's not this cold but this morning we were bundled up. We pushed off about 6:30. Ompi leaving first, than Scavenger, then me and then Slosh. We planned to walk the 1.5 miles to the parking area where there were trash barrels. I passed scavenger and walked awhile and the 1.5 miles seemed to be taking forever. I caught up to Ompi and said any idea why this is taking so long. He got out the guidebook and we read .10 side trail to parking area with trash barrels. Oops we missed it. We treked on and another 3 miles I stopped at a gravel road with parking to call my credit card company. Apparently they sent me an email thinking there may have been fraudulent charges. Well there were cause that card was at home and I haven't used it since early March. It took awhile but the situation has been rectified. After being transferred 3 times and telling my story again and again and no I do not know my credit card number and no I do not know the security code I'm in Virginia and my card is in New York. Ompi and the RC passed me and all 3 heard me on the phone and knew it wasn't good. We went over highcock knob and descended down to an approved campsite where we filtered water and had a late breakfast snack. The next shelter was only 4 miles away and we all planned on stopping there for lunch. I pushed on before the rest as I had a package in Glascow, VA and wanted to try and get to route 501 in time to get into town before the post office closed. The trail so far was mostly downhill with only 2 modest climbs and then a third leaving the campsite. The last climb was following a side of the hill for most of the way with a small incline. You hardly noticed you were climbing as the trail was barely a pitch and went in a straight line along the side of the hill.   I called the post office just to confirm that my package was there before I made the trek into town. After about 2 miles from the campsite the trail began its descent from 2600 feet to 865 feet at the James River. The trail descended steeply at points but the last 1.5 miles was the same pitch at an angle down the side of the hill with no switchbacks. It wasn't to terribly a steep pitch but the side hilling was not flat but at and angle and the trail went in a straight line. So the same steady repetitive motion started causing my legs to cramp up. Finally I could see Matts Creek shelter where I stopped for lunch. Lightning was at the shelter having his lunch and the last time we saw him was at the campground by Jennings Creek. He is a nice kid who hikes at a really fast pace, he doesn't always do big miles but he's hard to keep up with. We will probably see him again in Waynesboro. He moved on about 15 minutes after I arrived. About 30 minutes after I arrived Ompi showed and so did the RC. We had gone about 12 miles at this point and it was only 1:30. An older couple arrived at the shelter who were doing a section of the AT. They have been trying to do small sections every time they travel. They didn't stay too long and headed out back towards route 501. I took off about 1:45 in hopes of hiking the remaining 2.2 miles relatively quickly and then try and get into town. We agreed everyone was going to stop at the shelter on the other side of the river. This would only be another 1.7 miles after I got back to the trail from town. The post office office closes at 4:30 so that should give me 2 hours to get there. The walk from the shelter was nice and easy. The trail first followed Matts Creek to the James River and then the trail followed the Janes River. I arrived at the footbridge that takes you over the river and it is the longest foot bridge on the AT. Apparently in the past it was a thing to jump off the bridge into the river. There were signs posted everywhere do not do not jump off bridge. Many have died and it's illegal. I passed the coupe from the shelter a few yards before the bridge. Walked over the bridge and ended at a parking area adjacent to 501. To get to Glascow you head left on 501 and the road on that side has no shoulder and no place to pull off so I stood in front of the parking area trying to hitch a ride. The sun was hot and I as sweltering and must of looked pathetic because the couple from the shelter came over and said do you want a ride into town. Yes please I said!! Thank you! They dropped me off at the post office where I thanked them again and went in and grabbed my package from Chris Lovell from Massachusetts. I then headed to the dollar general to charge my phone and do a small resupply. Afterwards I was going to go to the pizza place and get a sub but apparently all restaurants in the town are closed on Mondays. Sigh!! I was all excited for FOOD!! I swung into the gas station to see if they had any hotdogs or whatnot. Nothing! I ended up with a bag of corn chips and ate the whole bag. On the plus that was a total of 1440 calories. I should be eating 6000 a day and that helped. With my phone fully charged I headed back on road and started hitching while walking. I only made it over the bridge when a man stopped and said you need a ride. I was like heck yea. He said you mind jumping in the back as I have too much stuff in the front. I was like for a ride I'll ride on the roof. A few minutes later he dropped me off at the parking area and I thanked him and got back on trail. The 1.7 miles to the shelter was steeper than the guidebook showed it and I arrived at the shelter at 6:15. The RC and Ompi where the only ones there and they had a fire going to control the black flies or knats that just seemed to come out within the last two days. While unpacking my bag I announced I had a surprise. I had bought and packed out a 6 pack of beer. Everyone cheered and we sat and made dinner. Everyone was sleepy and ready for bed at 8:15. We all were in our tents/hammock by 8:30. Tomorrow we have mostly big climbs up and an 18.8 mile day ahead of us.","Thunder Ridge Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538224,"I didn't wanna get up today. With the sound of the creek at the shelter and warm temps it was a comfortable night sleeping and I slept well. I finally pulled myself out of bed and filtered water and packed up my tent. I organized my food bag and figured out what I was doing for lunch. Ompi had gotten up and bit earlier and pushed off as I was eating breakfast. I got on trail at about 7:30 as the RC was finishing up their breakfast. This morning the first thing staring me in the face was a 2000 ft climb up to the summit of little rocky row and big rocky row both near 3000 feet in elevation. The climb was not terrible with a lot of switchbacks but for some reason I was sweating buckets. I reached the summit of little rocky row and took a break. There was a fantastic view of the James River looking south and you could see the foot bridge we had passed over yesterday. I took some pictures. I continued on and descended a little bit before climbing again. The next knob had a small viewpoint over looking the river again. I sat and rested and posted a few pictures and texted Jeff. I received a text from Otter. The wedding is over and was wonderful and he is coming back on trail from Ohio. He asked were I was and I told him right now not near a town but the next big town would be Waynesboro. After some back and forth I came up with a plan. Ompi and the RC are going to do a Nero tomorrow or what they like to call take it easy Wednesday. There is a hostel 8 miles away 1 mile from the gap we will be walking through. They are going to set up their tent and walk to the hostel to resupply and have lunch. Then on Thursday they will do around a 18 mile day and Friday do 12 miles and camp at a brewery. The brewery provides breakfast and some other nice things including a ride back to trail. Saturday they have a 15-18 mile day and then Sunday into Waynesboro where they will take a zero on Monday. My plan is to do big miles tomorrow. I will split from Ompi and the RC for a bit probably for about a week. I am pushing for 30 miles to the 4th shelter from where I am tonight. It will depend on weather, terrain and how my body feels. Then on Thursday I will have 23 miles to do to reach Waynesboro where Otter will pick me up in his rental car. We will stay in town and I would like to take a zero Friday so I can do laundry, relax etc. Saturday we get back on trail and with Otter being off trail for about three weeks we will do low miles until Ompi and the RC catch up and then continue north from there together. That is the current plan as it stands now. After this longer break of texting I continued on and descended for a bit then had another climb. I don't remember the name of this mountain or the one prior. I have a routine that every time I complete a page in the guidebook I rip out the competed page and burn it causing the guide book to get lighter and lighter. It's sort of another motivator to get to Maine. Normally I burn it after I write the journal entry in case I need to go back for reference. Tonight however I burned it before and now I can't look anything up ha ha. The climb up mountain number 3 was steady but not steep. I caught up to Ompi who was resting and his ankle was acting up on him. We both continued on and made it to the summit at about 11am. There were great views to the west and east. I took a break and sat on one of the concrete remnants of an old fire tower. There was a plaque remembering a child who got lost and made it 7 miles up the mountain in a snow storm and died frozen to death by the summit. After resting and drying out my sweaty clothes I continued on. The plan was to meet at the next shelter for lunch. I passed Ompi on the descent as he was resting his ankle and arrived at the shelter at about 11:45am. I took out my therma rest and laid it on the shelter floor. I was beat almost to the point of exhaustion. I'm not sure why as I slept great and have been eating as much as I can. Ompi showed and we chatted for a bit and I must have passed out. I slept for about 15 minutes and awoke with a start. I was like sorry Ompi for falling asleep on you while we were talking. He said no worries I checked out the water source and it's not the best the side stream will work well for a pump filter but not for my sawyer. I'm gonna continue on .40 miles more and fill up by the Blue Ridge Parkway and I might come back and rest here. I said ok and laid back down as I was so sleepy. I thought to myself I will wake up when the Royal couple gets to the shelter. Well the RC decided to push on and not stop at he shelter as it was .20 miles off the trail. I jumped up out of a sound sleep and was like what time is it? Where am I? I looked at my watch and it was nearly 2pm. Yikes!! I guess I needed to sleep. I wonder if the Royal couple are ahead or behind me as at this point I didn't know they had pushed ahead. I packed up after eating a quick lunch and descended down to the blue ridge parkway where they had a trash bin. Yay!!! I continued on with a series of 4 rises and descents were ahead of me. None of them very long but steep. On the third rise a military jet who must have been training zoomed overhead with a big boom. I thought a plane was crashing and dove into the bushes. It sounded like it was headed into the mountainside and scared the bejesus out of me. The trail then did a long 3 mile descent down to a gravel road and a small river. There was a suspension foot bridge with a yellow note attached at the end of the bridge that read Hornets nest under third post. Then someone else wrote yellow jackets nest mid way on bridge. Then finally someone else wrote fucking bees all over entire bridge do not bounce when walking over bridge. I was like oh boy this is gonna be fun. I started on the bridge and walked briskly and did not stop. Bees were flying about but I stayed ahead of them. Hikers are great about leaving signs that warm of dangers. Things like rattlesnake under rock at 12:30 June 11. So you don't end up sitting on rock or bees nest here. It's a good thing but sometimes it makes you paranoid for awhile because you are now looking for something that is no longer here. Better to be safe though and the heads up is well appreciated. After crossing the bridge I had a small climb and crossed the 800 mile mark. Holy crap 800 miles Wow! There was a small stick display the read 800 miles, spelled out with sticks. The trail then followed the side of a hill overlooking a lake. The trail side hiked for about 3 miles and all I wanted to do was jump in the lake but there was no easy way down to the lakes edge. I passed several lake houses and suddenly heard a telephone ringing in the middle of the woods. I looked around and no houses, cabins, cottages. I could see the lake but no buildings. All I could think of was the person had there phone rigged up to a loud speaker so they could hear it ringing when outside in the yard or on the lake. It was rather strange to be in a woods setting and hearing a house phone ring. I did think I was hallucinating for a few minutes. I was like am I really getting that delirious. I crossed over a fast flowing creek and refilled up on water. At this point I only had 2 miles to go following the creek called Brown Mountain Creek to the shelter. I arrived at 6:15 with the RC and Ompi being there about 30 minutes prior. They met up and had lunch at the footbridge with the bees. They all said have a good nap you must have really zonked to not catch up to us. I set up my tent by the creek where the designated sites were and Ompi was nearby with the RC being in the pad one site over. I jumped in the creek and cleaned up. The water felt fantastic. We all made dinner together in a circle and chatted while we ate. I told them of my plans to run ahead and meet Otter and have him recondition himself while they catch up. They are happy we all will still be together. Slosh and I discussed the 4 state challenge. Hiking from the Virginia border to the Pennsylvania border in 24 hours. It's a thing some hikers try to do. It's 44 miles and you complete it in 24 hours. Mmmm I don't know it sounds like a challenge. Scavenger yells at us both in her British accent isn't fucking walking 2000 miles challenging enough? We laughed maybe she's right but it's something to think about and keep on back burner. Bedtime for us all now. Tomorrow is gonna be a big day and they are calling for thunderstorms.","Matts Creek Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538376,"Woke up at 5:30 to the sound of Brown Mountain Creek. It's so nice to sleep next to a creek while hiking as it always provides a great nights sleep. I got up and packed up and said goodbye to Ompi and the RC. They will probably catch up to Otter and I in about a week. I pushed off about 6:30 and had a 4 mile climb ahead of me up Bald Knob. It wasn't terribly difficult but it was a continuous up. I was pretty beat by the top and rested for a bit. I descended skipping over Cow Camp Shelter which was .6 miles off trail and pushing for 30 that was too far. The trail after this followed a ridge line with gradual ups and downs offering some nice views. It allowed for me to collect some miles fast. I stopped at Steeley Woodworth Shelter for lunch. After lunch there were some steep ascents and descents up and over Spy Rock and two more unnamed hills. I then began the climb up the priest. The trail followed an old road which made the climb not as difficult as it could be. I stopped at the Priest Shelter to filter water and to check the radar as there was a line of storms in west, West Virginia. The storms have gotten closer but the northern part had fallen apart so I pushed on. The summit of the priest was only .50 miles north and had a good view. It was hazy and mostly cloudy but I did get a good picture of the storm clouds. I then had a long 5 mile 3000 foot descent. The trail was rocky, steep and lose gravel. It was slow going and being at the end of the day between 22-27 miles I was careful not to trip. I made it to the Tye River suspension bridge at dusk about 7:45. I decided to push on as it was only 2.9 miles to Harper's Creek Shelter. It was 1000 foot climb to the shelter and it seemed to take forever. I arrived at the campsites for the shelter first and decided to set up there instead of looking to see if the shelter was empty. It was ten pm and I crawled in my tent and crashed. I did 30 miles today and that much closer to getting Chinese food.","Brown Mountain Creek Shelter
",Harpers Creek Shelter,"Jun 15, Wed",30
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538475,"Woke up later than normal today but when you do a 30 mile day the day before I guess your body needs rest. I had tented at the Harper's Creek approved tent pads. I got up and packed up and headed down to the shelter to filter water. There were three dads their with their kids doing 2 overnights in the woods hiking a section of the AT. There also was another thru hiker there. One of the dads had cooked and put in a zip loc bag about 2 pounds of bacon. Everyone had eaten already and he asked if we wanted some as he didn't want to pack it out. We were thrilled and said yes please. So myself and the other Thru hiker munched down on bacon. Yay trail magic. I filled up on water and got on trail at 8:30. The first climb of the day was three ridges mountain. The climb up was steady with several switchbacks which brought you to a ridge line and a rock ledge with a view. Then it continued up some more switchbacks to another ridge with a view of the chimney. The chimney is a rock outcrop that looks very much like a chimney. The trail than looped around the chimney and climbed steeply to what appeared to be the top. Nope it was a false summit with steep switchbacks to the real summit. That was mentally challenging and by the top I was practically on my hands and knees. What I seem to be running into is when I eat I have energy but that goes fairly quickly. It's hard to eat all the calories you need each day and to carry that much food that you need. So at times when climbing I just feel week and this was one of those moments. When at the true summit I collapsed in a heap and dug out my granola bar and ate it. Feeling energy coming back to me I began the descent down. In my guidebook it said that at the next shelter if you follow the old jeep trail for 1.2 miles and then the blue ridge for .50 it will take you to a hostel that has a deli and resupply items including cold beverages. I was sold and had been thinking about this since yesterday. It was 2.6 miles down to Maupin Shelter from the top of three ridges mountain. There was one cliff on the way down that offered fantastic views. I arrived at the shelter and refilled on water. I had a feeling today was going to be all about the water. Refill, refill, refill. The time was around 11:45. I found the jeep trail and followed it to the parkway and then walked the parkway for .50 to the Royal Oaks cabins and hostel. They had a country store on site with a deli. I ordered the biggest sand which you could get with two bags of chips and 4 drinks. 2 sodas and 2 gatorades. I sat and ate on the patio while my phone charged. I chatted with one of the workers or maybe the owner I'm not sure for about an hour. I headed back out and got back to my place I left the AT at around 2:45. I continued on and felt like I had much more energy than before. There was one small climb and the trail descended down to Reeds Gap. I saw Gaia there and another girl who were trying to hitch a ride to the Devils Backbone Brew Pub. They were at he intersection of the blue ridge and VA 664. They allow free tenting and do a 3 dollar breakfast in the morning with a ride back to the trail. I said enjoy the beer and continued on. The guidebook showed the next 6 miles to be relatively flat but what the guidebook didn't show was that it would be 6 miles following the side of the ridge in a boulder field. Ugh a hiker can never have an easy section. The trail passed cedar cliffs which gave excellent views to the west and of the looming thunderstorms. At this point I was thinking of shelter as I had 2 hours until they arrived. The next shelter was still 10 miles away and I had not seen many campsites. I pushed quickly to find a place to camp before the storms arrived. I didn't want to be walking in them. Severe thunderstorm warnings were preceding the line and I knew it was gonna be rough. I climbed steeply to a view point and just after it the trail looped around and went by a lower section of smaller trees with a flat area where people had obviously camped before. Perfect!!! I quickly set up the tent making sure the rain fly was on perfect and the stakes were in solid. I organized and walked up to the view point to see the angry sky. It was coming and had about 20 minutes. I got into the tent to hunker down and it hit. First the gust front and through and it must of been 50 mph winds. Then the rain came down in sheets. Thunder lightning and more wind. My tent held up and I didn't get flooded. Phew!! It was one of the most intense experiences of my life. I have never been in a thunderstorm in a tent, actually never been outside in a thunderstorm except for running to and fro from a car. Add in sitting in a wooded spot on top of a ridge and whoa!! I survived and ate a quick dinner and now bedtime. Due to my 3.4 side trip and being weak and tired from yesterday I do not have 5 miles to town but more like 14. Meeting Otter there tomorrow night.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538786,"Woke up to the sound of rain on the tent. Darn, it wasn't raining earlier when I was up. I thought packing up in the rain is going to be miserable. Oh well. There was a lull in the rain at about 7 and I had already packed up what was on the inside of the tent. I quickly jumped up and packed up the wet tent and the rest of my gear. I got on trail about 7:45 to fog and mist. There was only one more small climb to the true summit and then to smaller climbs down below but the majority of the morning would be downhill. The walking was slippery as it was all we rocks. I came across a section hiker who was going southbound and we talked about how crazy the storm was being near the summit. He had it worse than me as he was a bit higher up on the mountain. I went about three miles and it started to rain, well not it was more like it started to pour. I tried to stay focused on town, Chinese food, a nice bed and a shower. It was pretty unpleasant walking the remaining 9 miles. I had my rain pants and raincoat on but with that much rain and how heavy it was everything slowly became wet. This also included my boots which actually stayed dry until the last few miles. I stopped at the shelter right before town to dry off well to at least get out of the rain. There would be no drying off. I walked the remaining 4 miles and came out of the woods where The Parkway meets Skykine Drive and route 64 is. I crossed the wooden fence on the side of the road and walked toward the visitor center when a guy in a red truck stopped and asked Did you just come out of the woods? Have you called anyone yet? I said yes and no. He told me wait right by that hot dog stand and I will be right back. I walked over to the hot dog stand and bought a soda and the guy in the red truck was back in 5 minutes. His name was John and he is part of a group of trail angels from the Waynesboro area that help give hikers rides into and out of town. He drove me into town and showed me where all the places I may need were. Things like the laundromat, Dollar General, Ming's. John dropped me off at the Quality Inn and I was most appreciative. I sat on a bench in front to come out of my hiker fog as everything happened so quick. I was on the bench for not very long and Otter pulled up. Wow talk about timing. We checked in and I immediately took a shower. We then walked over to Ming's and ate lunch. Talk about a super Chinese buffet. They had 6 tables of food and a whole sushi bar area as well as a hibatchi grill area where a chef would make you stuff. It was rather impressive and only $7.99. Once we finished eating we stopped back at the room and picked up ghost and went to throw my laundry in. While it was washing we stopped into Dollar General and Family Dollar to resupply. I ran over and threw my stuff in the dryer and we then got ice cream while it dried. Once the clothes were dry we walked back to the motel to organize, repack and relax. Soon it was time for more food and we stopped at a pub in town for burgers and beer. Not sure how it happened but it was suddenly 11pm which was so past my bedtime. We walked back to the motel and I passed out rather quickly. I decided that I wanted to pack out the motel bed on the trail because it was so comfy.","Stealth Campsite on Humpback Mountain

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538866,"I slept in at the motel this morning. Got up around 7 to lower back pain. It seems like when I take a day off the following day my back hurts. I think it's a residual affect to not wearing a pack for a whole day. The pain usually only lasts for a little while and then it subsides. I got up and showered and we headed to breakfast at Waffle House. It was fantastic and we don't have this restaurant in the northeast. After breakfast Otter and I headed back to the motel and packed up our things. Check out was not till 11 so we took our time. Ompi got into town last night and actually roomed next door to us. Most of the Quality inn last night was thru hikers and I think I knew most of them. While hanging in the room I saw Slosh walk by our room as Scavenger was right behind him. The Royal couple made it into town. I also saw the dude or (Jake the fake) as his trail journal name is. We know him on the AT as ""The dude"" he made it in as well. We chatted for awhile about our hike and the true meaning of hike your own hike. Some people get offended or upset when you hike with them for sometime but then move on for one reason or another. They may enjoy your company and might be sad your moving on but don't be offended. You will cross paths many more times as you move forward and new people will come into your fold and give you new great memories and experiences. We both agreed it's important to get much out of your hike and not get stuck in a rut. Follow where the journey takes you and if your gut says I need to don't hesitate. We all chatted while we played ball with Ghost. Ompi and the Royal couple went to do laundry. I went back into the room and finalized my packing. We saw see sharp a bit later and he came down to say hi and play with ghost. At noon our trail angel Michael picked us up to bring us back to the trail. He agreed to give Slosh a lift to the outfitter and back with us. We arrived at the interchange parking lot and thanked Michael and said goodbye. Otter and I bought a soda from the food truck and enjoyed a cold drink before getting on trail. We walked the side road back to where I came off the trail and crossed onto Skyline Drive after crossing over a bridge over I-64. We walked the road for 1/2 mile and the trail than shot into the woods and climbed back up to the ridge. About a mile in we came upon the self registration station for those who were overnighting in Shenandoah National Park. You fill out a form and the top portion you tie to your pack with metal twist ties. I don't see this thing lasting very long but good thing we should only be in the park for 7 days or so. We continued on and stopped when we got to McCormick Gap for a late lunch. After lunch we had a small climb up to a bunch of communication towers on top of Bears Den Mountain. The guidebook also said there were tractor seats at the summit. I didn't understand what that meant until I got there, see the pictures for a visual. We started down the other side and began looking for a place to camp. We were gonna start with a short day to let Otter get his trail legs back as he has been off trail for about 2-3 weeks. We came to a field which was the beginning of Beagle Gap and you could see a truck below where you could see coolers. Was this trail magic? Someone from the truck yelled up to us from the truck do you guys want cold drinks. We ran down the rest of the way. They were getting ready to wrap up for the day but saw us and waited. The people were a thru hiker who was taking a day off and her mom and grandfather. They decided to do trail magic together at the gap. So amazing and unexpected. We stopped and chatted for awhile, drank and ate snacks and then moved on. The trail after crossing the road climbed back up through another field on the other side of the road. We still were looking for a place to camp but no luck yet. We were hoping for a place when we got to the woods but nothing. We slowly continued on as we were tired from the sun and from all the sun yesterday. We finally reached the summit of Little Calf Mountain which was an open field that had been mowed with fantastic views. This was the place to camp and it was my first time camping on a bald like summit. It was a full moon tonight and the sunset was shaping up to be epic. Otter and I set up our tents. Bi choose to forgo the rain fly as I wanted to see the stars and full moon. We ate out dinner and played ball with ghost. A girl showed up with a dog who was local and had walked up to camp over night to watch the sunrise in the morning. She had made fresh Picco and had tortilla chips and shared with us. Fresh veggies (salsa) it was delicious. We chatted while watching the sunset she the moon rise and it was magical. A perfect evening. We got into bed about 9:30 as the colors began to fade.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539007,"It was a fantastic night on Little Calf Mountain. It was the first time I have slept without a rain fly on and with the nearly full moon it was pretty cool. We woke up at around 5:30 when Otter let ghost out to pee and he spotted a white tailed deer and barked and ran off chasing it. He came back shortly there after but all the commotion I was up. Otter made coffee and I ate my pop tarts. We packed up and got on the trail about 7:30. We walked the 1.3 mile to Calf Mountain Shelter to fill up on water. This is another stretch of 13 miles of no water which kind of sucks. Sometimes even though the guide book doesn't say it you will come by a spring or creek that is flowing due to how wet it has been but not always and you can't count on that. With ghost and is two we were going to need a lot of water. We filled up everything we could carry and moved on. For 8 in the morning it all ready was hot and I knew it was going to be a tough day. We walked a few miles too Sawmill Run Overlook and took a break in the shade and had some snacks. Otter's knee was giving him grief and overall soreness was making his day tough. Coming back to the trail after having some time off always makes it tough. We carried on and had a steady climb up Turk Mountain. It was really hot and we were drinking a lot of water. The heat was making me so sleepy I didn't have the energy to move. We made it to Turks Gap where we stopped for lunch in a shady spot in the parking lot. We assessed what we had left for water and it wasn't looking to good. We really hadn't hiked very far today mostly do to the sun, heat and Otter going slow to reacclimate. We found a small campsite a bit up the trail from the parking lot and decided to take a nap. We slept for about 2 hours and woke to it being a little cooler. We weighed out our options. Otter says he didn't think he could make it the 8 miles to the next shelter with his knee as it hurt more now that he slept than before. He decided he would try and get a ride to town to fill up on water and I would stay with all our gear. I set up my tent to chill in as the black knats were pretty bad in this location. Otter texted me that he got a ride, later I found out he paid 40 bucks for a ride to town. I'm not sure if he called someone or if he asked someone in the parking lot. Any ways he made it back to Waynesboro. I made myself dinner and had enough water at least until tomorrow. After about two hours of trying to get back Otter gave up and got a room. Now we are laughing at the ridiculousness of this. He's in town at a motel and I'm in the woods with all of our gear in a tent. Luckily there is enough water for me and I think he feels bad that his slowness and soreness has gotten us into this situation. However I knew the first week with him back would be low miles. So for now I'm just going to go to sleep and see what tomorrow brings. We didn't hike very far but we did do some miles and every mile is one step closer to Maine","Little Calf Mountain Stealth Site

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539198,I just realized while writing this that the date is one day behind the actual date of each entry. One of my zero's in town sometime prior I must of forgotten to do a journal entry and ended up being one day behind. I woke up at the stealth campsite at Turks gap around 6:30 am. I checked out radar and saw a line of showers and thunderstorms headed my way. I quickly jumped up and got the food bags down and everything inside the tent so it didn't get wet. I fell back asleep and woke to the sound of rain. Otter texted me around 8am to say that he was trying to rent a car and come to pick me and his gear up or just me. It was my call if I wanted to come back into town. He said he would text me when he was on his way. I drifted back into sleep and he texted me an hour later to say he had a car and was on his way and it would be 45 minutes. I started packing everything up inside the tent and luckily the rain had stopped and the sun came out so the outside of the tent dried out. After two trips I got everything down to the parking area at Turks Gap. While waiting for Otter I checked the weather and they were calling for nasty thunderstorms this afternoon and evening. When Otter showed I decided to stay in town and he offered to pay for a room for me as he felt bad I was off trail and he had extended the room he had already before he left and it was only a single queen. We headed back into town stoping at the motel to drop of our gear and ghost. We headed to Ming's Garden because heck we are back in town why not go twice. After lunch we went back to the motel and I watched ghost so Otter could go to the clinic and get his knee checked out. It only took about an hour and a half and I played ball with ghost while he was at the clinic. They think Otter has septic arthritis and gave him antibiotics and told him to keep off it for three days with today being day one. So Otter is going to be off trail for two days while he lets his knee feel better. He got back to the motel and I took a shower and watched tv for awhile. We then went to pick up his prescription at Krugers and to grab a pizza for dinner. By 7 pm we both were ready for bed and went to our rooms where I proceeded to watch tornado survivor stories on the weather channel until 10 pm as storms kept rolling through. The plan is to have Otter drop me off at Turks Gap in the morning and he will try and catch up with me.,"Stealth Camp site by Turk Gap

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539342,Woke up at the Quality Inn after sleeping in for a bit. I got up and packed up all my gear. The forecast was for severe storms and the possibility of a Duracho. I debated on what to do. Should I stay again or should I go. Otter decided to extend the rental another day as he was still going to be here resting his knee. I hated to take another day off from hiking but felt it better to be safe than sorry. The weather channel was saying this would be a nasty event. We decided to split a room by the days inn as we found a better rate. We checked out of the Quality Inn and drove down to the Days Inn and checked in there. Once we got all of our stuff in we went and grabbed lunch and to run errands. We lounged by the pool as a few showers and thunderstorms moved through. From the looks of it I made the right choice in staying out of the woods. The storms that started to form looked to be nasty and I didn't really want to be in a tent for them. It was another day of relaxing and not doing much of anything. We went to Outback for dinner and then headed back to the motel and relaxed. Let's hope the morning is in better shape and I can finally get back on trail.,"Quality Inn

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539503,Woke up at 4am in the Days Inn to the boom of thunder. The severe storms had made it to our area with some smaller storms coming through before we went to bed. I went back to sleep and got up about 6. I showered and packed up all my gear. The plan was for Otter to take me back to the trail and then drop off the rental car. I looked at the radar and there was a line of storms from Virginia all the way back to Indiana and they kept forming in the same location. I was now stuck at what to do. Go back as I would surely be soaked but they were calling for flash flooding and there were already some flood warnings out. I decided to stay another day as its better to be safe than sorry. Boy did I make the right call as it rained all the way to 11pm that night. Otter decided to keep the car one more day. We went out and grabbed breakfast as there was a 45 minute lull in the rain. We stopped at Target to pick up a new wall plug for my phone charger as mine stopped working the night before. We headed back to the room as it poured and poured. I got sucked into a marathon of Nightmare on Elm Street as they were showing all 5 of them on Sy-Fy. Otter took a nap and read. We finally decided we needed to do something. At this point it as time for dinner and we basically skipped lunch. We went to Applebee's did then went to the movies to see Independence Day Resurgence. When we got out of the movie the rain had stopped. OMG will I actually be able to get back on trail tomorrow.,"Days Inn

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539652,"Woke up to sunshine at 6am. Wohoo finally the rain has subsided. I got up and jumped in the shower while Otter took Ghost outside. By the time I got out of the shower Otter had gone and come back from Starbucks with coffee. Yes!! I was pretty much packed and ready to go. Otter was gonna stay one more day as the antibiotics was giving him terrible digestive issues and really didn't wanna be in the woods. He was taking stuff to off set that side effect. He was planning on getting dropped off where ever I was on Saturday. I loaded my stuff into the car and we were on the road by 7am. We stopped at a gas station on the way so I could grab something to eat for breakfast. I got dropped off by Otter at Turks Gap at around 7:45am. His plan was to bring the rental back to Stauton and then get a ride back to the motel and take it easy. Judging the condition of Skyline Drive this morning I assume it was pretty nasty up here the last few days. I started off and my body was in fairly good shape and seemed to jump right back into hiking mode. The biggest thing I noticed today was how many times you cross Skyline Drive when you are hiking the AT through Shenandoah National Park. I understand it's because the trail used to be where the road is now and they needed to relocate the trail when Skyline went in, but the amount of times it crosses almost ruins it for me. I hope as you get further north it becomes less but I don't think it will be. Don't get me wrong it's very pretty and the park is wonderful but it seems like every few miles you cross and then cross again. I stopped at Blackrock Hut for a snack and to refill water. The trail overall this morning was easy grades with some climbs but it is laid out in such a way that it's not overly difficult. The top of Blackrock Mt had some nice views and the AT skirts the summit which is just lose boulders which you can climb up and see the view. I took some pictures and moved on. I stopped at Brown Gap and ate lunch. I then began the climb up Loft Mountain where there is Loft Mt campground. I was planning on stopping at the camp store for some resupply stuff and to charge my phone. The trail was rather rocky which made the going slow. In Shenandoah Park the trails are marked with concrete pillars with metal bands at the top telling you what's in that direction and distance. It's a different style of trail markers and they must last longer than wood but the look of them are rather ugly. I'm not a fan. The AT skirts around the campground and there were many concrete pillars telling you what campground services where nearby. I walked 3/4 of the way around when I finally found one for camp store. I walked up to the camp store and plugged in my phone and iPod. I went inside to pick up some lunches and to buy a cold drink. I hung at the store for about a half hour then pushed on. In a mile there was a side trail that went down to Skyline Drive where there was Wayside which was like a park cafeteria which did burgers and hot dogs. There exhaust fans were broken so they could only make cold sandwiches and hot dogs. I ordered 2 hot dogs, a small soda and a bag of chips all for only 11 dollars. Good grief I forgot national park food is not cheap. I ate and packed up and had to walk the .50 miles back up the hill to the AT. Walking down to Wayside it was a 1/2 mile straight down and I knew the hike back up was going to stink. I got back to where I left off on the AT and continued north. There was a ledge look out about a 1/2 mile north of where I got back on the trail. Nice views and to the north there was a towering thunderstorm. I pulled up the radar and that cell was moving east. Phew! However there was another cell north of that which was moving due south. The next shelter Pinefield Hut was about 4 miles away so I didn't waste any time and moved. After about a mile of a steady downhill it turned around and became a steep uphill. My foot started to hurt where I had fractured my foot about ten years prior. This usually means the support in my footwear are shot. Luckily Jeff ordered me a new pair of inserts and will be bringing them next weekend. I struggled the last three miles. My foot throbbed and I had no choice but to keep walking. I was also racing the clock as the storm was getting closer. Well at the top of the ridge where there had been a fire last year the storm hit with lightning, thunder and rain. Ugh!! I was only about .75 miles from the shelter and I didn't make it. Luckily when I arrived there was still a spot upstairs in the shelter up against the wall. I threw my bag up, hung my food from the bear pole and rolled out my pad and sleeping bag. Definitely time to crash as I just had done a 22 mile day. When I arrived waterfall was at the shelter on the main floor. I hadn't seen her since Marion where she, her guy and myself ordered pizza and had it delivered to the shelter. That was at partnership shelter in southern Virginia. I guess the guy she was hiking with (can't remember his trail name I gotta look it up) went home. Didn't get the whole story. Also sweep was there set up next to her and I saw her last when I was racing to catch Ompi. I met her right before I got into Bland. Finally right before I turned in for the night Gasket showed up and I hadn't seen him since Damascus. He had waited for side winder to feel better and then took two days off to watch a sports event. I didn't catch what event it was. It's kind of nice to have all these familiar faces around me. Also I should mention there was a ridge runner at the shelter named Carl. He was really nice and I think I saw him doing trail work the first day we got into the park.","Days Inn

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539724,"Woke up in Pinefield Hut at around 7:30. We all slept in as it was a foggy morning. It was a full house in the shelter with 10 of us in a shelter that's supposed to fit 6. We weren't cramped and all fit comfortably. The rain will do that to any shelter. So today my climbs consisted of Weaver Mt, Hightop Mt, Saddleback Mt, Baldface Mt and Bearfence Mt. My rest stops would be all the gaps on Skyline which were Pinefield, Simmons, Powell, Smith Roach and Swift Run gap. The climbing was much steeper today than yesterday. Shanendoah pulled out the stops today with some steep big climbs. I left Pinefield at 8am and was on my way. I stopped at Simmons gap to get water from the ranger station as they had a hand pump out front. On the way back to the trail from the ranger station there were 3 deer grazing on the side of the road. They stayed as I pad and one of them came up to me to sniff. Wow so close. When I got back to where Skyline meets the trail from the side road to the ranger station I remember the Coke can. I was excited as I packed out a Coke from Waynesboro which I was going to drink at lunch. It was in the side pocket with one of my water bottles. It was super foggy and misty. I had my pack cover on as it was so wet and it kept dripping on the back of my legs and shorts getting my backside wet. After a few miles I rested and realized that it wasn't water dripping on me but Coke. The can got a bit crushed and was leaking out of the can and dripping out the bottom of my pack. I grabbed the can and opened it to quickly drink what was left and I was barely a mouthful. Noooooooo I was so looking forward to that Coke. Ugh. The only good news is there was the Lewis Mt campground 15 miles away where I could buy a Coke. I just needed to get there before they closed at 7. I continued my up and down climbs stopping on the view point of high top mountain. I crossed over the 900 mile mark on the way up to the summit which was very exciting. Someone had made a sign out of sticks on a rock on the side of the trail. The fog and clouds were starting to break up as some sun came out while I was eating. I became the dedicated picture taker for the weekend and section hikers as they came out to the viewpoint. It was no big deal I was there and no reason why I couldn't. One interesting thing I noticed on this Saturday was while hiking north and weekenders or section hikers were coming south they would jump out of the way for me. I always said thank you and most said you deserve the right of way. It made me feel good to have that respect for what I was doing. I made it to a picnic area where I filled up on water and had a snack. Only 5 miles to go before I reached Lewis Creek Campground and Coke!! I should add that my foot was giving me grief today like it did late last night. Exactly where I fractured my foot ten years ago it was sore when I walk. Usually this happens when the support in my shoe is shot. Luckily Jeff ordered me super feet and will be bringing them down to me on the Fourth of July weekend. I popped Ibuprofen to numb the pain and walked slower than normal. The other issue I had which was the first in the whole trip was Ass crack chaffing. Not going into detail but it sucks!! Thank God for Gold Bond tonight. I reached the campground at 6:15 and made it to the camp store with plenty of time to spare. I ate a whole bag of tortilla chips and 2 Cokes. Several of the other hikers were there from the shelter last night. Waterfall showed as I was getting ready to leave. She went for the 20 opposed to the 15 she was going to do. Her ankle held out and she thinks she will pay for it tomorrow but she did it today. I only had .8 miles to go from the campground to the shelter. Made it there at around 7:45. I was full from all the chips and soda so I skipped dinner. I set up my tent, brushed my teeth, put my food bag in the bear box and crashed for the night. Gonna shoot for 26 miles on Sunday.","Pinefield Hut

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539826,"Woke up at 5:30 and was like this is way too early and rolled back over to sleep. I finally got up and packed up around 6:30. Ate a cold breakfast and put my boots on. While sitting on a log putting my boots on, one of the section hikers camped nearby was drinking her coffee and said there is a bear next to you to your right. I turn my head right and sure enough there is a beat about 20 feet away slowly climbing up the hill. It stopped to look at us for a bit but then kept on moving. Finally after 900 miles of walking I finally saw a bear. I got on trail about 7:30 and walked a mile taking the side trail to Bearfence Mt view point. I had a signal at this point and updated my journal and sent out a few texts. Today's climbs were going to consist of Bearfence Mt, Hazeltop Mt, Big Meadows, Hawksbill Mt, Stony Man Mt and the Pinnacle. I went over Hazelnut without realizing it because I thought I was further back in the log book and thought I was doing the little unnamed climb before it. That made me happy. I arrived at the side trail to the visitor center and Wayside at about 10:40. I was hoping I would make breakfast and did with 5 minutes to spare. Waterfall, big sky and 3 other thru hikers were there as well. The same group I've been with the last 2 nights at the shelter. I had breakfast, Coke and a cup of coffee. Get it all in while I can. Afterwards most of us say outside at one of the baby picnic tables outside the building. I bought a small resupply mostly snacks for the next couple of days. A woman came over giving us trail magic. She gave each of us an apply and a Milky Way bar. Yay!! I pushed on about noon stopping at Franlin Cliffs to take some pictures. Went up and over Hawksbill Mt and stopped for a snack at the stables for Skyland Resort. Most of the hikers I was with were planning on staying the night here but after being in Waynesboro for three days I wanted to keep moving. I took the side trail to the top of stony man Mt to a view point which was packed. This is the highest point on the AT in Shenandoah Park. The last 4 miles I struggled as my feet were shot. With my insoles really failing I not only had a sore foot where I had fractured it ten years ago I know had two blisters forming on the pad of each foot. I took my time and kept self motivating and made it to Bryds Nest #3 Hut at around 8:15. I set up my tent, made dinner and crashed. Almost 23 miles hiked today.","Bearfence Hut

Otter stayed one more day in Waynesboro and his knee blew up again and his leg went numb for a few hours. He drove back to Aiken to have his primary Doctor look at it. He is more or less done with the trail this year but wants to meet me in Vernont, New Hampsire and hike a bit as he never has been to either state. Luigi is still behind me and should be either very close to Waynesboro or just left. Her parents were up for a week hiking with her. She's been hiking with rambler and I believe . The Royal Couple (RC) Scavenger and Slosh are a day ahead of me and currently staying at the mountain home cabin. I am going to try and catch up with them hopefully in the next few days. Ompi was ahead of me but got off trail at around mile 900 and went to mountain home cabin to rest his ankle for a week. He texted me today that he needed to fly home to Florida as his partner was in the hospital. Nothing super serious but he needed to be there. He told me he would be back by July 6th where he got off. Gaia, Feather, the dude, ghost, holy diver, karma and grandma are between 7- 2 days ahead of me. Little foot and Tranquility are a ways back probably near Dragons tooth. Waterfall and gasket are behind me by one day as they stayed at Skyland Resort. Anyone else you wanna know about message me and I'll give you an update. I woke up late today. 7:45 am!! I packed up and didn't get on trail until about 9am. The beginning of the day I started with a climb up to Mary's rock which was the last talk peak in the park in the AT which was at 3500 feet. Great views and several pictures were taken. Then a long decent down to Thorton Gap where I refilled on water in the restroom and washed up. As I was drying my hands I glanced down into the trash and thought anything good. OMG what's wrong with me. Food food food food I was starving but scoping out trash barrels is to much. My next climb was up Pass Mt and all I could think about was just 5 miles to Elkwalkow wayside where I could get a burger, fries, milkshake, soda, chips, maybe pizza!!!!!! The 5 mile walk seemed like 50 but I finally arrived and was in the hiker daze for a few minutes. I took out my electronics to charge and found an available plug. I then ordered a cheeseburger, fries and a soda. I ate that and bought to more sodas from the cooler which were .99 cents as they were a no name brand but who cares. I did a small snack resupply and then ordered a chocolate shake and cinnamon roll for dessert. After lunch I had my big climb up Hogback Mt which was a chore with a full stomach. When I reached the summit I was able to get radar loaded on my phone as I finally had service. Flood watch in effect and a line of storms were coming. I boggied to get to the shelter before the rain came down. I almost made it but it was lightly raining by the time I got there. Five minutes after I arrived it down poured. Luckily there was still room in the shelter up top so I threw my stuff in. I turned around and there was Freefall coming back from putting his food bag in the bear box. I said where is my MIA water bottle. He laughed and told me he tried to get a ride to the outfitter but couldn't then his phone died and he didn't have a cord to charge it. End result it's still at 4 pines hostel. I'm going to call and see if they still have it tomorrow. Met some nice folks here tonight I will name them all tomorrow because right now I can't remember their names. About 18 miles done today.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540090,"It was a tough night of sleeping at the shelter. We all settled down around 8pm. I was on the top tier of the shelter and the temperature was about 70 with a dew point near 68 or 69. It was super humid and hot. With 7 guys and 2 girls all crammed in together in the shelter and 9 pairs of boots and shoes and 9 packs and the faint odor or urine it was oh so pleasant. I did finally fall asleep but kept waking up and at 6 it felt like I hadn't slept at all. I got up and packed up and got on trail about 7:30. Last night I met firecracker, Kodak, Irie, Sparkles and moose. Also gasket, free fall, and Captain Planet were there as well. Only 14 miles to route 522 and my options were go into town and stay or stay at mountain home hostel which Ompi highly recommended. The first climb of the day was up and over Mt Marshall which offered a nice view at the top. Climbing down the other side I realized that I wasn't wearing my gaiters. Ugh! I left them on the picnic table at the shelter. I even looked around saying do I have everything but they must of been between 2 people sitting. Maybe someone will grab them and bring them forward. After Marshall Mt the trail descended for several miles and then a short but steep climb up Compton Mt which didn't offer much of a view. After summiting you then have the long descent into the valley to route 522. There was one small bump to climb over and it seemed like the hardest climb of the day oddly enough. It was probably being at a lower elevation you had more heat and humidity. The last 2 miles to the road were a breeze and I sat on a bench at the parking area. I decided I would call Mt home to see if they had any beds available. If not I would take the trolley into town from the trailhead. I called Mt home and Scott answered and said yes we have lots of space come on down. I crossed route 522 and followed the AT which parallels the road. At gate 7 you head back to 522 and the hostel is 100 yards up the road. When I got there firecracker and Kodak were there waiting for the postman. Kodak had a package going to the hostel but it hadn't arrived yet so he was hoping it would come today. Scott was inside finishing up the cleaning from yesterday's guests. I checked in and was the first one so I got to pick my bed. The property is amazing with 2 buildings on the ground. The smaller the cabin was a log cabin which was bricked over in the 1910's and is now where the hostel is. The main house is being restored by Scott and his wife Lisa and they are bringing it back to its original glory. It was built in 1840 and has had several additions. They are going to make that a bed and breakfast. He is very nice and Lisa is in Chicago so I didn't get to meet her. After I checked in he went back to work on the main house and said he would bring me into town around 4. I took a shower and the hostel provides hiker clothes so you can do all of your laundry. When I got out of the shower I had a text from Freefall who said Gasket had my gaiters. Yes!! I went downstairs and Kodak and firecracker were gone so I hope he got his package. Gasket showed up about 30 minutes later with my gaiters and he was going to wait for Scott to come back so he could buy fuel. Freefall and Captain Planet stopped in for cookies abs lemonade which Scott and Lisa offer hikers at no charge. Scott brought me into town at 4:30 where I did my laundry, ate dinner, had ice cream and an iced coffee. I texted him when I was ready to go back and he came down to get me. I was the only guest at the hostel last night and had the place to myself. The upstairs where 4 of the beds are have a big sky light and I watched the Lightning from the thunderstorms to out east. It was a great night and tomorrow I push to try and catch the Royal couple again. They stayed at the hostel the night before and left at 10. I missed them only by 3 hours.","Gravel Springs Hut
",Mountain Home Log Cabin Hostel,"Jun 28, Tue",13.70
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540217,"I woke up at Mountain Home at around 7am. Scott said he would have the coffee on at 7:30am and would make breakfast at 8am. He's a fantastic guy who Thru hiked southbound in 2012. Him and his wife Lisa bought the property in 2012 and opened the hostel a year later. The main house they are turning into a Bed and Breakfast and are slowly renovating. They hope to be open by 2018. Scott headed up to the main house at 8:30 to begin his work day. He works remotely. I thanked him and went upstairs to pack and was on trail by 9:15. I had a total of 5 climbs today and none of them had names. Just hills I guess at this point. About 6 miles in I stopped at the Jim and Molly Denton shelter for a snack. It is probably one of the nicest shelter I've been to on the trail. They had chairs out front similar to Adirondack but not exactly. The shelter even has a solar powered shower. Wow talk about luxury. I pushed on and climbed into a meadow which had a bench at the top of the hill. This would be the only view I had for the day. After the meadow the climb down to Manassas Gap begin. The trail was steep and rocky such that I kept tripping. At the gap the trail crosses over railroad tracks and then crosses onto tucker lane passing under I-66. There was a man talking to a woman with a backpack on. She didn't look like a hiker and he said when the trail turns you will see a blue canopy and three tents. No one is there but help yourself to soda and snacks. Yes please and thank you. Unexpected trail magic on a Tuesday, wohoo. There were two other hikers there when I arrived. These were the same 2 hikers I had met at the Denton shelter. We sat and chatted while drinking cold drinks and eating oatmeal cream pies. They left before I did and while they were leaving I noticed that it appeared there had been a bad storm as lots of branches were down coming down from the ridge and now it looked like whole trees had been felled. The trail crossed over a bridge over a stream and it then climbed up to a ridge. Most of the way up there were uprooted trees, branches down, trees snapped and twisted. I first thought it might have been straight line winds but the damage and the direction that the trees fell did not indicate that. Then I thought later maybe a microburst but again the damage didn't indicate that either. Trees higher up on the fudge had just the tips snapped off as you went lower down the ridge the trunks were twisted and while trees uprooted. It looked like EF-0 tornado damage to me. I took some pictures. I pushed on stopping at Manassas Gap shelter for a snack. I continued on and the trail is rather easy in this section. Yes lots of ups and downs but more gradual so it's not as tough on the body. I arrived at dicks dome shelter and ate a late lunch. The two other hikers from earlier were there and calling it a day. It was 3:30 and I was pushing on for another 8.6 miles to the next shelter. After leaving the shelter I had a climb up to sky meadows state park. Lots of open fields and nice scenery. Not really any views but it was a plateau on top of the hill. I climbed down from sky meadows to route 55 which was a 2 lane divided highway which I had to cross. That was a challenge as the traffic was nuts and people drive way too fast for the road. Once across I had more climbs albeit smaller I was spent and walking almost in a coma. I only had 3.6 miles to the shelter. I told myself I would stop at the first available campsite. Of coarse there were no place to camp at all so I kept going. Finally making it to the shelter at 8:10. There was no one in the shelter but three people tenting nearby. Ireie was there from two nights ago. Put down my pad and rolled out my bag. Made dinner and am now laying down ready to crash. As I am writing this apparently the shelter is directly under the approach for Reagan airport. Plane after plane coming in for a landing. It's actually lulling me to sleep.","Mountain Home Log Cabin Hostel

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540328,"I woke up at around 6:30 this morning and was on trail by 7:30. Not too many if of us last night. I was the only one in the shelter and four other people were tenting or hammocking nearby. Today I am going to meet up with Tom. He is a friend of Mike K. who lives in the Catskills and is a friend of the family. I've gotten to know Mike over the last several months very well and he is fascinating to talk to especially anything about botany. Mike's friend Tom just recently moved to Virginia near the AT. When Mike found out I was still in northern Virginia he suggested I met up with Tom to take a rest. So that is what I'm planning on doing. His house is near Snickers Gap and we've been texting back and forth. He is 10.5 miles from my location and 3/4 of the way through the Rollercoaster. Speaking of that the Rollercoaster is 13 miles of tightly packed ascents and descents. They range from 300-700 feet. I came to the beginning of the Rollercoaster and there is actually a sign stating what it is and to enjoy the ride. I started up the first climb which wasn't too bad. Then the decent was steep with lots of loss rocks. Ugh the second climb was steep and lose rocks. By the third I stopped more often. Then the fourth climb I was moving really slow, fifth I was like oh dear god and then the sixth I was like ok I wanna get off now. I arrived at Sam Moore shelter at the bottom of the sixth climb. I had 3 more climbs to reach Tom and 7 to finally leave the Rollercoaster. I had a snack at the shelter and refilled on water. I started up climb number 7 but this time it wasn't too bad because somewhere in .40 miles I would cross the 1000 mile mark. Wow it's crazy to think I just walked 1000 miles. So waiting for that point kept me distracted from the steepness of the climb. Finally in the distance I see on a tree a brown sign that read 1000 in white numbers. I hit the mark and took a few photos. Ok the moment passed and I continued on. Down hill 7 and start up hill 8. Ugh finally onto bears den when Tom texted me did you start up bears den yet? I said I'm climbing it now. He said ok I will meet you at the top. I reached the summit and didn't see anyone matching Toms description. Hmmmm finally he was behind a group of trees blocking each other's point of view. We said hello and chatted a bit and headed back down to Toms car. He drove me back to his house which is so neat. It must have been built around the time of the civil war. The inside is all wood beams and wood floors all original. You could feel the history of the place. Tom made me two sandwiches and we chatted about plants, weather, global warming and the Catskills. I started to get sleepy and took a nap while he ran to the market. I got up and took a walk down the street to the general store where I bought homemade cookies and a drink. Tom got back from the market and he cooked a wonderful dinner of spaghetti with sauce with ground chuck and grilled onions. We talked more about plants, the weather, and global warming. Around the time of my nap he had asked do I want to spend the night. At first I was like I should rest for a bit and the keep on walking but with how tired I am I decided I'll stay. After dinner he had to run out and feed the animals for a neighbor who was away. I crawled into bed which is so comfy by the way and am settling down. I've decided I'm leaving everything and just taking this mattress with me back on the trail tomorrow.","Rod Hollow Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540455,"I woke up this mornings at Tom's house and packed up and went downstairs. He was already up and making me breakfast which was a nice surprise. At 7:00 he said are you all ready to go and I was like yes I am. He drove me back to the trail and I thanked him for all his kindness and for putting me up. He drove off and I realized I was in the parking area for the AT on the opposite side of route 7 from yesterday. I had a dilemma now, do I get on trail from that parking area and go north or do I follow the trail back across route 7 to where I got off it yesterday. Of coarse I thought to myself it will make me nuts if I miss that .20 or .30 mile section of trail. So back I went and crossed over route 7 which was like a game of Frogger. It's a two lane divided road like a highway and people are cruising. I climbed up the small hill on the other side and made my way back to the side trail where we got off the AT to the parking area. I turned around and started heading my way back the way I came. I got back to route 7 and again held my breath as I dashed across the first two lanes and then the next two lanes. I finally was back to the original starting point and kept moving on. Oh boy back on the Rollercoaster again. Thank god I had such a nice rest at Toms and had energy for this. I had three climbs until I was out of the Rollercoaster. I made it up and down the first hill and was resting on the second when dragon head caught up to me. I had seen him at the last hut in Shanendoah and he had taken a zero in Front Royal. We chatted and started walking together. We got along well and had very similar hiking paces. We went several miles arriving at David Lesser Memorial Shelter where we filtered water, had lunch and took a nap. We were off for about an hour when hiker John showed up. I hadn't seen him since Fontana Dam and it was nice to see him again. He had cut his hair so I didn't recognize him at first. Alice showed up and so did leviathan, two hikers I hadn't met before. We all chatted a bit and dragon head and I moved on. We walked about 2 miles when we passed a ridge runner for the Potomac Apalachian Club and we chatted for a bit. Another mile we stopped for a drink and Dragon Head realized his water bottle with his sawyer had fallen out of his bag. He was like crap no biggie on bottle but that's my sawyer and I kinda need it. I said walk back up and leave your bag and hopefully it's a little ways up. Well the ridge runner came across it and brought it back to the shekter. So poor Dragon head had to walk all 3 miles back to shelter and then back to my location. He in theory added 6 more miles to his day. We continued on crossing WV 9 which was again a game of Frogger, a bit terrifying. The terrain was nice with a few small climbs. On the last climb I finally came to it. Now crossing over to West Virginia. I couldn't believe it Virginia the longest state on the trail was done. I felt amazing, dragon head took my picture and we moved on. We started the descent into Harper's Ferry and made it to the edge of town at 5:30. We came to the Shanendoah River and crossed over on the bridge. With the highway right there and cars zooming by it was loud and hot even at 6 at night. We took a side street arriving at the tea house and with luck they were not sold out. Yes!! We picked our bunks and Dragon Head paid for laundry and said throw some of your stuff in here so it's not a total waste. We both went to dinner at a restaurant right up the road. All in all it was a great day and I really enjoyed hiking with Dragon Head. I hope we get to do it again soon. I need to remember to get his cell number. Jeff is coming down tomorrow for the Fourth of July weekend. I'm so excited to see him as its only been once I have seen him since starting my thru hike. I will be hiking I think each day so technically no zero will happen.","Bluemount Virginia
",Teahouse Hostel ,"Jul 01, Fri",19
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540608,"I woke up at the Teahorse Hostel around 5:30 and was like this is way too early. I went back to sleep finally getting up at 7 to have breakfast. The owner of the hostel had come upstairs and had both tables set and there was coffee, orange juice, bananas, waffles with butter and syrup. Yum it was delicious. Overall the hostel was a wonderful place in a fantastic setting in Harper's Ferry. There is also a bike path in town which is several hundred miles long. Half of us were hikers at the hostel and the other half of us were bikers. It was a nice mix of people. Many of us hikers were taking a least one or two days off for the holiday weekend, myself included. Jeff was driving down today to meet me somewhere on the trail. Some of the hikers staying last night were feather, gasket, free fall and dragon head. I met cup of tea and Alice and 2 more hikers who I didn't catch their names. Gasket, Dragon Head and I sat in the lounge area and chatted for a bit. I was waiting for the ATC to open so I could get my picture taken and find out what number NOBO hiker I was. About 8:30 I got up and packed up my gear. I left the hostel around 9:15 and headed back down the side streets to where we got off the trail. It was only a 1/2 mile to the ATC which is in a stone building. They have a hiker lounge with drinks, snacks and computers for hikers. One of the staff asked if I was ready for my picture. I said lets do it and we went outside to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy sign. She took my picture and then brought me inside to fill it out. We were to put our start date and today's date on the top above our picture. Then below we were to put our name, trail name, email and phone number. I was north bound from Springer thru hiker 1185. When I started at Amiacola Falls at the archway I was hiker 1320. It was so exciting to get to the ATC in Harper's Ferry. Hiker John was there right before me and was hiker 1184. While in the hiker lounge they have past books of all hikers by year. I found Josh (worm) who hiked in 2001 and found Jeff (lost boy) and Jessica (messy) who hiked in 2014. It was really neat to see how many hikers there have been before who have gotten to this point. I was at the ATC for about an hour and I then pushed off and started hikingnorth. The side trail back to the AT takes you down side streets and past national parks buildings. Once back on the trail you wander through the woods then come out to the rustic downtown with cobblestone street. With it being the Saturday of the Fourth of July weekend and sunny skies the downtown was mobbed. It took me forever to get through as people were stopping me to talk and to take pictures. I finally made it to the bridge over the Potomac and started over. The Amtrack train was also going over which had the Royal Couple on it as they were off to DC for the weekend. I crossed the bridge I descended into Maryland. The trail now followed the Potomac River and was a flat bike trail for about 3 miles. It then curved left going over the train tracks curving into the woods and then started a steep rocky ascent up to the ridge line. For this section of trail I was not expecting a steep climb like this and was a bit surprised at how steep the climb was for Maryland. However when you are starting at 225 feet and going to 1165 in about 1.5 miles it's going to be steep. Once on top it was relatively flat and I pushed the 6 miles to Gathland State Park where I was going to meet Jeff. Originally we were going to meet at the Washington Monument State Park but Jeffs drive down was taking less time than originally planned so I moved the meeting spot ahead. Finally he was there. Yay!!!!!!. I threw my gear into the car and we headed to Haggerstown to find a place to stay. Time for some relaxation and to load up on some calories. One quick edit, before I left the hostel The Dude showed up to pick up Feather and a group was going to Gettysburg for the day. It was nice to see Jake again as it had been awhile.","Teahouse Hostel

We got up and showered and headed out. Our first destination was back to Harper's Ferry so we could go to the National Park. We still have our national parks pass from last year when we went to Yellowstone. We got to Harper's Ferry around 11 and parked in the visitor lot and took the shuttle over to the town. We walked the streets and shops. I took Jeff over the bridge I walked to go over the Potomac River. We walked up to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy so he could see that. I saw Cake there and Captain Planet. We had lunch in one of the restaurants in Harper's Ferry and took the shuttle back to the parking area around 3. Our next destination was Anteitum Battlefield National Park. It was a really interesting location and reminded me of Gettysburg. We headed back to the hotel and stopped for a snack and at Walmart so I could resupply.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540846,"Woke up this morning at the Marriot Spring hill. Jeff decided to stay one more day as they were calling for lots of rain and he didn't want to drive back in rush hour traffic. We got showered and dressed and Jeff was going to slack pack me today. We ate breakfast, bought some coffee and he took me back to Gathland State Park where he originally picked me up. We arrived at Gathland State park and it was low clouds and a bit of mist. I started up and there was a gradual climb to the white rock cliff. It's amazing how fast one can boogie when you aren't carrying a heavy pack. I felt like I was running. I stopped at the second shelter and had a snack. Once I started back on the trail it started to rain. As I was leaving the shelter I bumped into Cake who was coming into the shelter. I saw her in Harper's Ferry yesterday. I arrived at Washington Monument State Park in the pouring rain and wind. This is not to be confused with the Washington Monument in DC. Apparently there is a second and its a rock tower which you can climb and see the views in the valley. Well today there was no views in the fog and rain. There was a family in a sheltered sitting area who was trying to take a group photo so I offered to do it for them. They had a waterproof camera which made it easier to get them all in I stood in the rain to take the picture. I pushed on and had several small ups and downs. I crossed over I-70 on a footbridge over the highway. I passed two Thru hikers who I had met in Shanendoah National Park. I don't know their trail names but they were hiking with one of their moms. This was her first day hiking and the weather couldn't be more miserable. I stopped at the next shelter to text Jeff I wanted to keep going to about 7 as I was making big miles. After I left the shelter I had a steep climb up to the ridge. For the next 8 miles it was relatively flat with some gradual ups and downs that were hardly noticeable. The rain kept pouring down and I was pretty soaked and was trying to get a lull so I could text Jeff where to meet me. This section of trail passed Annapolis Rocks, Black Rocks Cliff all which were pea soup fog so no view and I decided to not take the side trails. I finally was able to get a text through to Jeff to meet me at mile mark 1055.5 which was route 77. As I continued on I came up behind waterfall. She was like ""no way, I thought you were ahead of me"". Waterfall is probably the one person on the trail who I've seen the most. I was only about two miles from the road. The trail at this point became super rocky. There was a rather steep climb and then a steep descent which made it slow going with all the wet rocks and rain. I made it to the shelter before the road to text Jeff that I was at the shelter and almost there. Hiker John and C-sharp where at the shelter. C-sharp I hadn't seen since Rice Fields Shelter at the beginning of Virginia. I moved on passing through a field with many cows. With the fog it made it a spooky scene. I got to Jeff about 7:20pm. I did 22.4 miles today in about 7.5 hours which I thought was pretty darn good. We drove back to the hotel so I could shower. We went to Olive Garden for dinner so I could carb up. After dinner I went down to the pools hot tub to relax my legs.","Marriot Spring Hill Suites

I got up showered and went down to the free breakfast letting Jeff sleep. Got back to the room bringing Jeff a coffee and began to pack up all of my stuff. We loaded up the car and headed for more coffee. Iced coffee this time as it looked like it was going to be a hot day. We stopped at a restaurant for breakfast and then we're on our way to mile 1055.5 where Jeff picked me up. I swapped out stoves at this point going with the jet boil vs my wood burning stove. At this point I'm so exhausted at the end of the day I don't want to be trying to lite a fire. Jeff and I said our tearful goodbyes and I was back into the woods. It was muggy which so far this has been the muggiest it has been on the trip. The uphills were slow going. When I reached the high rock trail and was on top of the ridge the trail became very rocky and horribly marked. It was like they gave up on this section of the trail. It was the first time the whole trip I lost the trail and within a half mile I would lose the trail 3 times. Where there was so much lose rock it was easy to lose the trail, however with a poorly marked path it made it that much harder to follow. We had not quite gotten into Pennsylvania yet. I entered a state park and was able to fill up on water. I saw chef resting at picnic table and it was the first time I had seen him since Fontana Dam. I pushed on and came to the Mason Dixon line and the Pennsylvania/Maryland bored. Hurray!! The Yankee is home. I descended for a bit and then had an abrupt steep uphill for about 700 feet in elevation gain. With the humidity the climb was brutal and I had to make several stops. I finally crested and came down the other side crossing several streets on the decent. The trail leveled off a bit and went into the deep woods again with no road crossings. After one small climb the trail slowly descended with three shelters within a 6 mile stretch. I choose the middle shelter Antietam which I arrived at 8 pm. Waterfall was there and we chatted while I set up in the shelter as no one was in it. This shelter is near a road and a state park so several people tenting nearby. They are kind of loud but I'm too tired to care. I made dinner ate and am about to pass out. Tomorrow I should reach the 2016 half way point of the AT","Foxville Road Crossing route 77

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541145,"Slept awful last night in the shelter. When I arrived at 7:30 no one was in the shelter and I didn't have the energy to set up my tent. So I crashed in the shelter. Bad choice as it was so hot and muggy I couldn't just sleep on top of my bag like I would do in the tent. I tossed and turned and didn't sleep much. It was the muggiest night on the trail thus far. When I got up around 6 am I noticed the shelter was infested with barn spiders. I'm glad I didn't know that last night while trying to sleep. I got on trail at around 6:45. A 1/2 mile up the trail was a state park where I was able to fill up on water. I realized today is exactly 3 months on the trail. I pushed on and knew this was going to be a super hot day. By 7:30 when I arrived at the next shelter I was already soaked with sweat. I rested for a bit at the shelter and saw cake. I pushed on with a steep climb in front of me up chimney rocks. It was slow going up the hill with the humidity. I stopped at the blue blaze to load up with water when sleeping bear came up behind me. We decided to drop our packs and go the 100 yards to the view point. The view at chimney rocks was nice but showed how humid it really was. After chimney rocks we had a steady ridge with a few ups and downs until we started descending to route 30 by Fayetsville. On the ridge Cake and Haiku came up behind me while I was taking a water break. I had met Haiku before but never knew his trail name, cake I've seen a bunch of times since Unicoi Gap in Georgia. I actually met her the first time with Trooper while getting trail magic. Speaking of Trooper she is coming down to see me on July 22 wherever I am at that point. Cake, Haiku and myself hiked together to route 30 and then they needed to go into town to resupply. I told them I was gonna take a siesta at Caledonia State Park. The guidebook said pool area. I crossed route 30 and walked the .50 to the park. Talk about nice. The park was beautiful and the pool was fenced in with a snack bar and changing rooms, bathrooms and showers. It only cost 5 bucks. I met up with sleeping bear at the gate who had gotten ahead of me. We paid the 5 dollars and easily found the hiker area where all the packs were lined up against the fence. We laughed and took a picture as it was funny to see. I noticed I had developed a heat rash/welts around my waist where my pack strap sat and my lower back met my pack. The humidity was so thick anything that couldn't breath developed a rash. We spent the next 3 hours there swimming, eating, drinking fluids during the hottest part of the day. Cake, Haiku, hiker John and Waterfall all showed up as well as gentle giant, bear wall and Alice were all there. It was about 11 of us. I packed up at around 3 to continue on my walk. Most everyone else was packing up as I was leaving. The trail wanders through the state park past many picnic areas. There was a family reunion at one of the picnic areas and they offered me drink and food as I was hiking by. I took them up on drinks and watermelon but with the heat I just wasn't hungry for a burger and hot dogs. In about 15 minutes the whole crew was there eating. I left first as I wanted to take my time and not get to camp in the dark. I thanked the family and pushed off. Waterfall had also left right before me at the pool and I caught up to her about 3 miles up the hill. She had watermelon like me at the reunion but was too hot to eat food. We hiked leap frogging over one another. Her ankle is giving her trouble so she takes it slow and steady. She usually caught up and passed me when I stopped for a break and then I passed her after starting up again. This 8.9 miles from the pool to the shelter seemed to take for ever. With the eat it made the climbing tough. There was one step portion at the beginning and then a gradual up for 5 miles. 1 mile was a flat ridge walk. Then we had a steep decent to a cabin then back to a steep ascent. There have been several of these cabins in the last 200 miles since Shanendoah. The guidebook lists them as a named cabin and it says locked. Not sure if they are ranger cabins or what The one today looked like you could of rented it. The needless down and up was annoying especially when it was hot. Another NUNDS. Needless up, needles downs. The last 2.68 miles seemed to take 6 hours. I arrived first and the rest of the gang rolled in. The only two I didn't see were Cake and Haiku. They probably stealth camped before it got dark. Tomorrow/Today is the 1/2 gallon challenge. I'll talk more about it in the next post.","Anteitam Shelter

It was only 9.8 miles to the general store where the half gallon challenge was. The terrain this morning wasn't too bad. A gradual up led to a ridge and then a slow decline. Once I got to Dead Woman Hollow Road the trail flattened out to the official 2016 halfway point of the AT. I stopped and took pictures as well as filled out the log book. It was a fantastic feeling to be at that point on my hike. I continued on from the half way point and stopped at Toms Run Shelter for a snack. At this point I only had 3.6 miles to go. The trail had one climb before I reached the state park. Overall Pennsylvania as had some rocks but it really hasn't fazed me. I'm not sure if it's because I'm used to hiking on rocks in the Catskills and New England. I arrived at the general store at about 11:30. I went in to select my flavor of ice cream. They did not have coffee as that was going to be my first choice. Moose tracks was out, too heavy. Banana Cream Pie was out as the flavor would get old quick and become sickening. I settled on peanut butter pretzel. Heck if I'm gonna do this challenge why not go with a fun flavor. It took me about 35 minutes but I finished it and collected my wooden spoon. Needless to say I did not eat lunch. When I arrived at the general store sleeping bear had finished his half gallon. Feather was there eating a burger and I hadn't seen him in awhile. As I was eating my ice cream cake, haiku, gentle giant, hiker John and waterfall rolled on. Whitecap was also at the general store. Some attempted the half gallon and some did not. Hiker John, Waterfall, Whitecap and Haiku successfully did the challenge. The rest did not attempt. I figured it out that I had eaten 3044 calories. I sat for awhile letting the pile of ice cream digest. After about an hour I packed up and continued on the trail walking to the AT museum which was only a bit aways. The museum was neat as it had some itens of some of the first people to Thru hike. Such as it had done items grandma Gatewood took on her hike. I spent about a half hour at the museum and continued on to the lake for a swim. It was super crowed so I did a quick in and out. I dried off by the snack bar before continuing on. The rest of the crew were just getting to the lake as I was leaving. The plan for most were to go to the next shelter which was only 7.6 miles away. The trail followed s creek for a mile and then began the ascent. The climb was steady but not steep so no resting was needed even with the heat. It was about a 4 mile climb and then a descent with some small ups and downs after that. About 3 miles from the shelter a hiker with a black lab going south passed me. I reached out to pet the dog and the hiker said that's olive. I was like hi olive and said wait did you start April 6th. Sure enough this was the olive from the night Trooper and I were at Stover Creek night one. If you go back to my journal entry from night one I think I talk about Olive. I was so excited to see them. Her owner had taken two weeks off and was doing section hikes using his car waking south and then hitching back to where he started. I made it to the side trail of the shelter at 6pm and walked the .20 miles to the shelter. Well first off it wasn't .20 it was more like .50 up a hill and second the spring was dry so I had to walk all the way back to the trail for water. I was going to continue walking north but the rest of the crew were going to do the same thing of walk to shelter to discover no water. I set up camp west of the trail by the creek. As each of the crew made it to the side trail to the shelter I told them no water and they decided to set up there. Haiku was first, then cake, Alice, gentle giant, bear wall, sleeping bear, chef, mayfly. We had a crowd. Haiku started a fire and we all relaxed chatting. It was a great night.","Birch Run Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541425,"Cake gave me my wake up call at 5:30. Her and Haiku were going to get an early start and I asked her to wake me up so I could get one too. I wanted to get some miles in today before the blazing sun hit. I got up packed and on trail at 6:20. Cake and Haiku had already left when I got on trail. I got to the first road crossing and decided to walk the .20 miles to the deli up the street. It opened at 7 and it was 6:50. I couldn't pass it up. I was able to get a breakfast sandwich and coffee. After leaving the deli there was what I am calling the Pennsylvania mini roller coaster. 4 steep ups and downs in a short amount of time. The middle of this had a rock maze where you had to go over, under and around a bunch of boulders. With the extreme humidity it made for a tough go of it. Finally reaching the fourth summit I came to center point knob which was the original half way point many years ago. I sat and took a break and ate my bag of chips and can of Coke I had packed out from the deli. At this point there was a gradual decent down into Cumberland Valley and I was only 3.6 miles to Boiling Springs. The trail comes out of the woods and into a corn field. The trail snakes around the corn field snd begins to cross the valley. It was hot with no shade and having the sun blazing overhead. However given the 100% flat terrain I would take it. I arrived in Boiling Springs at 11:30 and stopped at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy northeast division which is right on the trail. Cake had texted me and asked where I was. I said I was in town and was going to get lunch next. I had planned on going to cafe 101 for lunch and that is where she was. She sat and chatted with me while I ate and sleeping bear was also in town and came into the cafe. I forgot how nice air conditioning is after not having it for several days. While in the restaurant a man came over and asked if we were thru hiking. We said yes and he told us he Thru hiked in 1983 and told a story about a man who they had met in Boiling Springs back in 1983 that used to put up hikers in his home and make them dinner. He explained he was too old to do that anymore but gave them 20 dollars for the three of them to have a nice meal. Well the guy saw three hikers sitting together and came over to ""pay it forward"" and gave us 20 bucks. We were very appreciative and after he left we learned the town pool was 5 dollar Friday's. We were gonna take the money and use it to get into the pool. On the way there we had a thunder shower and the pool was temporarily shut down due to thunder. The guy let us in for free as we were hikers and he felt bad that it was so hot and we were walking. We had to wait only 15 minutes and they reopened the pool. Most of the people left when it rained so we had the whole place to ourselves almost. The pool had three water slides as well. After we swam for an hour we walked back to the cafe and used the 20 from the man who's trail name was Mr. Incorrigible to buy us some snacks. I got an iced coffee and a cannoli. Sleeping bear was getting picked up by family for a night off. Cake and I talked about what might be a good plan. There is no camping in Cumberland Valley so the options were stay in Boiling Springs either at the free campground or hike another 16 miles to the next shelter. Another option was in 8 miles there was the town of Carlisle and they had several motels there. We decided with the heat lets hike 8 miles and find a motel to split. We pushed off from Boiling Springs at 4 and had a road walk down Main Street. The trail then darted into the woods and crossed many corn fields along the edges. We had several road crossings as we went over PA 74, 4 side streets, PA 641, the I-76 the PA Turnpike before arriving to US 11 which takes you into Carlisle. We walked the .40 to the super 8 and were able to do laundry and eat dinner at a 24 hour diner across the street. Cake and I called it a night at 9:30.","James Fry Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541578,"We slept in a little at the Super 8 and didn't want to get out of bed. Finally we moved and got our stuff packed and went down to free continental breakfast. We got back on the trail at around 8:30 after a brief road walk back to the trail. This morning the trail weaved in and out of corn fields and the forest. After 4 miles we began our first climb up to Darlington Shelter which has the Taj Mahl privy at it. This thing was huge and could of fit 6 people maybe more in it. We descended down off of the hill and the trail went trough more fields this time not corn just fields. It climb again up to a plateau that the guidebook called extremely rocky. Cake and I said ok let's give ourselves the expectation that it's going to be the worst rockiest section we've ever hiked. We made it up to the plateau and walked 1/2 way through it when we thought to ourselves this is not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. I guess putting that expectation out there made it not as bad. We stopped at a shelter to rest our feet as they were a little bit sore from all the rocks. Cove Mt shelter was .10 off of trail but in reality it was much further and down a steep hill. If we didn't need water I would have bailed. Cake and I continued on reaching a view point that overlooked the Susquehanna River and the town of Duncannon. We started a steep descent down with a set of about 50 stone steps to walk down. About 1/2 way down the trail climbed back up the side of the hill steeply which was very odd. Must of had to do with private land that the trail needed to go around. We finally descended to a side road and made it to town. We walked another 1/2 mile and came to a Sunoco gas station and ran in for Food. We had a few snacks and ate them while sitting on the sidewalk. Cake had gotten a text from Haiku that he was still in town and his parents had gotten them a hotel room at the Clarion. He was waiting for them at the Doyle. We only had another 1/2 mile to Doyle. Cake and Haiku went off with his parents to the hotel and I checked into the Doyle. It was one of those old hotels built in the 1920's with a shared bathroom. Very old building that showed its age but with very nice owners and only 25 bucks I couldn't go wrong. Now I need to debate do I stay here on Sunday to get my package or move ahead and have it forwarded to me. Decisions, decisions.","Carlisle Super 8

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541714,"Woke up at the Doyle at around 7am. The crew that called the Doyle home last night were the dude, feather, yurgin, blossom, Mowgli, and Alastair. There were several other hikers who I had not met before and didn't get there trail names were also staying there. The Doyle was an experience with its very old building, furniture and deteriorating plaster that was falling from the ceiling. It had no AC, my room had no working light and one of the windows looked like it was going to fall out of the building. However the owners were super nice and they are just trying to make it. With a cost of 25 dollars much more could not be expected. I got up, showered and packed. I hung in the room to just before check out time of 10am. I went across the street to Goodies and had breakfast. The town of Duncannon was a let down for a trail town where the trail runs right down Main Street. I get the sense it's a poor community with not much going for it. I was going to take a zero today but opted against it as I had no idea what I would do all day. I got on trail at about 11 and headed north. The trail goes through the town and then crosses over the Juniata and the Susquehanna Rivers. It the darts into the woods and climbs steeply to 1300 feet from the valley floor of about 300 feet. Once at the top the infamous Pennsylvania rocks began. Now I have analyzed the rock situation. If you are from a region where there are no rocks on your trails and it's hard packed dirt than this would be the most horrific thing ever. If your shoes soles are in rough shape or thin than you will hate the rocks. For me the beginning part of the day I was like this is nothing and it's almost fun. By the end of the day when I was exhausted I was like I hate all rocks. So time of day and level of tiredness also makes a difference. The rocks overall were not too bad so far. I will say by the end of the day my feet were swollen and sore from the sharp rocks. The stretch between the top of the climb and the first shelter was all large boulders and bed rock. Lots of rock hops and scrambles. I stopped at the shelter and had a snack and Feather and Mayfly were there. I continued on and the trail was flat and rock free. It was actually a nice pleasant walk on top of the ridge. I crossed over PA 225 and came to a parking area where day hikers gave me a bunch of ice cold bottle water from a cooler in their trunk. It was the best trail magic as I was so thirsty. I stopped at table rock view and Mayfly and the dude were there. We chatted for a bit and I moved on. I stopped at the next shelter to sign the log book and I think Mayfly had passed me. I moved on and the rocks started to creep back in. This time they were much smaller and pointy. I started to fade on energy. Finally I began the descent down to PA 325 and water. It was a stretch of 10 miles with no water. I came to the creek and saw Mayfly on the other side in an area that looked like great camping. He had a fire going in the fire ring. I went around the creek and joined him and set up shop. I set up my tent, cooked dinner and watched the fire while mayfly tried fly fishing as there was trout in the creek. I crashed early at about 9. Feather rolled on at about 10pm and the dude is MIA. Last I saw him he was gonna take a nap at table rock. I hope he didn't fall asleep all night as he didn't have a lot of water.","Duncannon PA

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541775,"Ok can't believe I said it but today I was bored while hiking. Uninspiring terrain, no views and rocks. This morning I didn't want to get up which is unusual for me. I finally motivated myself got dressed and packed up. Mayfly was awake and attempting to fish again. He had a fire going and I sat and ate in front of the fire as it was a bit chilly. I pushed off around 8 am and when I left Feather was still fast asleep. When I rounded the creek to get back on trail I saw Blossom and Mowgli walking just in front of me. We would play leap frog most of the day. Blossom and Mowgli I have seen several times since the Blueridge Parkway. I just recently learned their trail names. The first climb of the day was not nearly has bad as I had anticipated. It was on an old road and it was a gradual ascent where I did not need to take any breaks. When I got to the top I called the Duncannon post office to have my package sent ahead. It was a painless process and I'm excited that it will be waiting for me when I get to Porr Clinton. I followed the ridge descending gradually to Rausch Gap Shelter where I ate lunch. After lunch I had a climb up second mountain when again the trail followed an old road so the climbing wasn't too hard. I descended down the other side and the trail came into a field for about a mile. I then had several road crossings and the trail entered a state park. This state park didn't have a pool or a concession stand. We were spoiled before but the trail did not go through any part of the park that would have that though. The day grew hot and I began dreaming of ice cold Mt Dew. I had one small climb before descending down to PA 72 and crossing under I-81. Right before the road crossing of PA 72 there was a wooden bench with a red cooler on it. I opened it up and it was full of ice, pink lemonade and MT DEW!!! I have died and gone to heaven. I wish there was a way to know who this was from so I could thank them. The Mt Dew gave me the boost to do the climb out of the valley back up to the ridge line which was about a 1000 foot climb. The climb seemed to go fast as I put music on and has the fire power of Mt Dew behind me. I made it up to the top of the ridge line and the only reference point was an abandoned power line and view point in 3 miles and the shelter was 3 miles after that. Well I missed the abandoned power line and view point, apparently it grew in. So after walking for ever I was confused as to where I was. I had no idea how many more miles to the shelter. I sat down to look at the guidebook and assumed I had passed the view point and estimated I only had a little less than 3 miles to go. Well of coarse after starting walking again yhe trail became super rocky. Hello Pennsylvania rocks, thanks for waiting till mile 21-24 of the day to be brutal. I was tired, sore and week so it felt horrific but I know they aren't really that bad. If it was the beginning of the day it would be nothing. The boredom part of my day left when I arrived at the cooler of Mt Dew. Before that the trail seemed to appear that I was hiking the same 5 feet over and over again. I finally arrived at the shelter to two faces I haven't seen since Harper's Ferry. They were camped in the campsites and I went down to the shelter as I have no energy left to set up a tent. Only 1 other here in a shelter that sleeps 16. I took the upstairs and he took the bottom. He told me his trail name but it didn't sink in. I made dinner and climbed into my sleeping bag. It's nice to actually have service at night when I'm hunkering down. Usually there is no signal at whatever shelter or campsite I end up at. Tomorrow I'm stoping at the 501 shelter which is only 5 miles. Supposedly there is a solar shower and you can order pizza. I may however walk into town and go eat. It's only 2 miles off trail.","Clarks Creek Campsite

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541919,"I slept in late today after the 24.7 mile day I didn't want to move. I finally got the energy to get up at 8. I packed up my stuff and made some oatmeal before getting on trail. Today's terrain seemed rather flat with relatively small climbs. The only thing you can't tell from the guidebook is how rocky it will be. I pushed off at 9 and had gradual downhill to the 501 shelter which was only 5 miles away. I stopped in and my Eagle and Wallet who were about to head out. This shelter has a solar shower so I took advantage of that. Where the shelter is so close to route 501 you can order pizza. I looked at the menu and realized that they don't do delivery until 4pm. Well so much for that idea. I left the 501 and continued on and the rocks began. Little did I know that this would last for 9 miles. When people talk of the rocks in Pennslyvania this is what they must be talking about. Overall it's not terrible but constant rocks make you slow, start to make your feet sore and the greater chance of rolling your foot. I stopped for lunch at a viewpoint and rested for about an hour. After lunch was the only real climb I had and it was gradual. On the way up in apparently put my trekking pole on a rattler as at the same time I heard rattling and hissing. I literally jumped out of my skin and boogied forward. I didn't see the snake before, during or after the event. You try and keep your eyes out for them but sometimes you just don't see them. By around 2pm my energy had faded and I kept eating and trying to do everything I could to keep it up. The terrain was flat but the rocks were becoming frustrating in my weak state. I crossed over PA 183 and only had 4 miles to go. I don't remember much of those 4 miles as I felt like a zombie but finally made it to Eagles Nest Shelter by 6:30pm. I made dinner and was in my tent asleep by 7:30. Today I am off to Port Clinton and Hamburg.","William Penn Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542030,"Woke up at 6:30 am at Eagles Nest Shelter and packed up. I called the Microtel in Hamburg to see if they had any rooms left. The guy said they did and they should not run out. I got on trail at about 7:30 and immediately started with the rocks. Ugh the trail was fairly even with no ups or downs for awhile. I came across a very large black snake taking its time to cross the trail. I had one steep climb with all rocks which was slow going with the humidity. Once I summited it was all downhill from there. I caught up to wallet who was stopped in the trail for a rattlesnake. This guy was pissed and not happy. He eventually moved off the trail and coiled up and watched us as we passed. Wallet told me to go ahead and I moved on. I proceeded to pass 4 more snakes one I didn't see and it boogied off the trail with rattling its tail obviously annoyed. I finally got to the decent into Port Clinton and it was one of the steepest I've done the whole trail. The last bit was loose gravel and a very steep pitch and I thought thank god I'm not doing this in the rain. The trail comes out to the Port Clinton train yard and follows side streets taking you close to the post office. It was 11:30 and the post office didn't open until 12:30. I saw badger there who he and his girl Jules I've seen a lot on the trail but couldn't remember their trail names. Jules had gone home to move their stuff to Colorado and get ready for school. Badger and I walked to the peanut shop to buy some sodas and wait on a bench. I called the Microtel to book the room and they told me they were full up argh. Well guess no shower or laundry for me. The post office opened and I went in to get my package from Kirk. Homemade beef jerky wohoo. While outside another hiker told me about the pavilion which lets you camp for free. I headed down there and dropped off my gear. I took my small day pack that I had won at trail days and started to walk into Hamburg hitching along the way with no luck. I guess I didn't look like a hiker. Port Clinton doesn't have much in it. Hamburg the next town over has all the services. It was only 2 miles away so it wasn't too bad. I stopped at WaWa and bought the biggest drink possible as I was so thirsty. I then saw a sign for all you can eat Chinese buffet so I had to go there. Afterward I headed over to the worlds largest Cabella's to buy new liner socks. On the way over I saw snitzel who said he had a ride back to Port Clinton and to meet him at Walmart. After Cabella's I headed to Walmart for resupply. I met up with snitzel who called the guy to pick us up. He was such a nice guy and dropped us off at the pavilion. I organized my food and gear and then headed down to the Port Clinton Hotel for dinner. Finished up at around 9:30 and headed back to the pavilion. There are about 25 of us here tonight. Feather, the dude, blossom, Mowgli,c-sharp, hazel, snitzel, jack rabbit and several other familiar faces who I don't know their trail names. Several guys tented across from the pavilion.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542188,"Woke up early at the Pavilion in Port Clinton. Hazel was the first one out and she had slept near me so it motivated me to get up. I got on trail at 6:30 to a cloudy super humid day. The trail went through one more street in town and then followed the river before crossing under PA 61. It then began a very steep climb up and out of Port Clinton. The rocky climb was also made more difficult due to wet rocks from the humidity. I thought to myself what could be worse than Pennsylvania rocks. Well wet ones for sure. I hiked 5 miles with several ups and downs after the first big climb and stopped at Windsor Furnace Shelter for a rest and a snack. I met coach there who was trying to get motivated to get moving. With the prospect of all day hiking in rocks it's hard to get up in the morning. After leaving the shelter the real rocks of the day began and would be with me for the next 17 miles. Another big climb up to Pulpit Rock and then the trail was relatively flat but rocky as hell. I passed the pinnacle which was another view and more rocks. It made it very slow going. The trail finally came out to an old road and followed that for 3 miles. While there were some rocks mostly the terrain was smooth going and have my feet a rest. I descended down to Hawk Mt Road and just east on the road is Eckville Shelter which is manned by a caretaker. The shelter was nice with an separate building which has a flush toilet and shower. C-sharp was there when I arrived and a few others. I ate my lunch rested and jumped in the cold shower just to cool off. Coach, Hazel showed up while I was there and we ended up being a group of about 9. A line of big thunderstorms had passed just to our north but they took the humidity with them so things dried out dramatically. The caretaker for the shelter gave us all ice pops which I hadn't had since I was a kid. After about 45 minutes I got my boots back on and headed back out. Facing another big climb put music on and pushed on. Though it was drier it was still quite humid in the woods. I reached the top of the ridge and the guidebook showed flat terrain and it was just hard packed dirt. In my head I cheered and then I saw the rocks ahead. Ugh. The next 6 miles would be one of the toughest sections for me on the trail. Big rocks, little rocks, rocks with points so sharp you thought you stepped on a nail. Rocks that moved when you step on them, bedrock, moss covered rocks and all wet. To top things off which has been the case for weeks you have small gnats flying around your face and eyes. Which has happened before but makes more difficult in this situation is when those gnats fly into your eye. Sometimes both at the same time so as your rock hoping on went rocks now your eyes have been forced closed by bugs in them. Argh!! It was a slow 6 miles and it was getting dark. Oh please let's had darkness to this hell. When am I out of Pennsylvania? Finally I see the sign for Allentown Hiking Club Shelter. I collapse on the steps to the shelter and take my boots off. I can feel my feet throbbing as my heart is beating. The shelter only has two people at it Bonnie and Clyde. C/sharp arrives shortly thereafter feeling the same way as me both physically and mentally. That makes me feel better that it's not just me. I make a quick dinner after setting up my tent and crash fairly quickly. I hope the worst is over but probably not there is still 42 miles left in this state.","Port Clinton Pavillion

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542337,"I woke up this morning at 7:30 this morning struggling to get up. The last two days I have been so exhausted and having a hard time getting up and out of bed. Finally after some efforts I got up and packed and headed out on trail at about 8:30. There were only 4 of us at the shelter last night. C-sharp was at the shelter last night but moved on right before I crashed for another 4 miles and was shooting for Blue Mt Bed and Breakfast as they let hikers camp in back. Bonnie and Clyde were also there and are south bounders who started in Vermont. There was another person in the shelter who must of arrived after I went to bed and was still asleep in the morning. The morning terrain of the trail was relatively flat following and old road. After 4 miles I reached PA 309 and the Blue Mt. B+B where I was able to fill up on water out back. They are nice enough to let hikers fill up on water when passing thru. I rested for a bit and got back on trail. The black gnats were especially bad this morning and normally I just ignore them, but after having several fly into my eyes and get stuck under the eye lids and then swallowing a few abs coughing to death I put my bug neat on over my head. After leaving 309 the rocks were back in force and I climbed up to the knife edge. The knife edge was a bunch of large boulders smushed together to create a thin line you could rock hope across. It was really neat and interesting but hard to maneuver with a heavy pack hoping from rock to rock it did however provide fantastic views of the valley belo. After making it through the knife edge you walk to Bear Rocks which was more or less a cliff with great views. I took lots of pictures and continued on. The rocks continued as well with smaller boulders. After another few miles of small boulders I reached snd climbed up over Bake Oven Knob, or as my brain called it easy bake oven. After the kids toy. On my way down from the climb with more rock hoping I came across ""Thru hikers girlfriend"" as she called herself. Her boyfriend was hiking the PCT and she was out trying to bring some trail magic but waited to late in the day and everyone had already left the shelter. She told me she left ice cold waters in a mini cooler at the shelter. Yay was I excited as it was hot and luke warm water doesn't do it quite like ice cold. I stopped at the shelter and drank two bottles of water and moved on. The plan for me was to get to Palmerton for the night. There were 3 towns close to one another yet none had any motels or hotels. Bert's steakhouse said in the guidebook to inquire about stay so that was were I was headed. After 10 miles of rocks straight I came toSalvation. The rocks went away and I was in a field and meadow which had a forest fire several years ago and was growing back. The trail was flat and had great views into the valley. I began the climb down to PA 873. It was steep in sections but overall not to bad. It was getting hotter and more humid as I further descended into the valley. I reached 873, crossed the road and crossed Lehigh River via the 873 bridge. The trail them reached and interesection where you walk down one side of the road cross at the traffic light and then walk back the way you came. The road was 4 lanes of traffic and too busy just to cross. The trail followed the road for about 300 feet and then darted up into the woods. I came across a cooler right before a parking area and was like ""is it empty?"". No it was full of ice cold soda. Wohooo perfect after cooking on the bridge when I crossed the bridge in the hot sun. While I drank my soda I called Bert's to see if they had space before I trucked the 1.5 miles to town. They told me it was 10 bucks for a cot in back of the building and it included a shower. I said perfect. I took the side trail from the AT and got to Bert's at about 5:30. I checked in and got my towel. They had converted an old garage into a makeshift hostel. They also had built a shower in the alleyway. It was all sort of makeshift and the average person would have been this is sketchy but for a thru hiker 8 days without a real shower this was Salvation. I showered first thing and the had dinner at Bert's which was more of a diner then steakhouse. They do have two sides of the restaurant and the steakhouse side was fairly empty. The diner side was packed so that is where I ended up. After dinner I walked the town and got an iced coffee and ice cream. I made phone calls to the family and then headed back to crash. Tomorrow morning I have the climb up and out of Palmerton which the trail goes through the Palmerton Superfund Site which was from zinc smelting from 1898-1980. The 9 miles of ridge is deforested. Should be an interesting climb as it looks like a cliff from the valley. For now sleep.","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter
",Palmerton,"Jul 15, Fri",17.90
Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542509,"Woke up in ""Aunt Tracy's Garage"" at 6:30. I packed up and charged the remaining electronics. I actually slept really well in the garage even though it was hot I had an industrial fan going. Little did I know that this was going to be the most difficult day yet on the trail. I headed to Bert's restaurant for breakfast and loaded up on whatever I could fit down the hatch. After I finished with breakfast I walked to Family Dollar to buy a few small things and headed to Dunkins for my iced coffee. I got back to the garage and packed up the rest of my gear and got onto the sidewalk for my 2 mile walk back to the trail. The temperature in Palmerton at 8:30 in the morning was already 83 with a dew point of 71 I knew it was going to be a hot day. I also knew the first water source was not for ten miles so I had all 3 of my Nalgeen bottles full. I made it back to the AT at roughly 9:30 and started my climb up and out of the gap. This hill is part of the Palmerton Superfund site from zinc smelting between 1898 and 1983. The trail at the top has been rerouted to help repopulate trees as the whole ridge had been deforested. The climb up was very difficult with the beginning part of the climb similar to climbing 10 flights of stairs. Then you have to climb up rock cliffs. It was difficult with smitty, a trekking pole and having basically a 4 year old strapped to your back. The poles I had up toss up and then use my hands and feet to climb up each section. Finally reaching the side of the ridge the trail follows at an angle to the ridge line going over loose boulders of varying sizes for about a mile. Now physically this was easier but now you have loose boulders with greater chance of rolling an ankle. Finally reaching the top of the ridge line the trail is relatively flat with small sections of boulders or rocks jutting out of the trail. Though with the deforested ridge there were small birches and shrubs leaving me in the full sun for 5 miles. It was hot but I knew water was going to be and issue. The reroute of the trail was nice as it took you to the edge of the ridge and with small shrubs and grass you could see the whole valley. The trail finally after 5 miles darted back into a wooded area but this is where the rocks started up again. Will it ever end. I descended down to little gap road and proceed with a rock climb on the other side back up to the ridge line. The trail then became flat but instead of large boulders to hope from one to one the trail was now littered with small pieces of bedrock and pointy rocks sticking up on the trail at all angles. You had no choice but to step on them as there was not enough space between the boulders to step in dirt. This lasted for 15 miles with no breaks or if there was it was maybe 20 feet. Point after point poking the bottom of my boots. My insoles and tread are good but repetitive jabbing and my feet were starting to become sore. I came to the first spring at 9.6 miles in. This was were I was going to refill water. Small hand written note said spring dry. Gosh that's not good as the next water was the shelter but the guidebook said unreliable spring. I pushed on and passed eagle taking a nap on the side of the trail after what appeared him having his lunch. I was down to my last Nalgeen of water and had 3/4 of it left when it got to smith gap road. This is where I met cupcake and her guy burrito. They were getting picked up by burritos sister for dinner and maybe an overnight at a hotel. She was up for a wedding and normally lives in North Carolina. They gave me the rest of their filtered water which filled up one Nalgeen and I was back up 1.75 full. It was 3 miles to shelter and about 8 to wind gap. I pushed on stepping on pyramid after pyramid. Ow ow oweweewwwe. I arrived at the side trail for the shelter at about 4:30. It was .20 to the shelter and .20 to the water. The first and second water was dry but the third was 1.3 downhill was reliable. There were two girls and wallet at the shelter. They said another couple had gone to look for the third water. I thought to myself I'm gonna put that 1.3 to get me closer to wind gap. I signed the log and said goodbye to everyone. I moved on with only 4.6 from the shelter to the gap. I was down to my last Nalgeen of water. I proceeded to trip three times with the little rocks sticking up like mini walls just the right size to catch your foot if you don't lift it high enough. The third trip I almost face planted my entire front side on the jagged rocks. I have no idea how I recovered with the weight of my pack making the trip even worse. I had about one mouthful of water left when I started to descend into the gap. I could tell I didn't drink enough water today as I was rationing it. I had walked almost 20 miles with no refill on water. I also had walked in the hot sun for many miles which is something that's normal. Yes we are outside but generally with the tree cover you have filtered sunshine and lots of shade. So with the added abundance of sun I think it caused me to feel a little blah. When I reached the gap there was a hand written note informing hikers that the springs north of here were dry and to get water in town. I began the walk in which was a total of 2.5 miles. I tried hitching but no luck. I think now that I'm in the northeast I'm going to have a harder time hitching. I walked about a mile and came to a turkey hill gas station. I could see c-sharp, blue and sailor in front sitting and charging their phones. Their sentiments about water and rocks were the same as me. I went inside and bought a gallon of water and a Gatorade and a Mountain Dew. The three of them packed up and moved on as they had been in town for about 5 hours. After finishing my drinks I continued on further into them arriving at McDonald's. Good place to load up on food and to fill up on water as I drank most of the gallon already. While eating dinner my feet were throbbing and overall I felt gross. I decided I would just stay in town and soak my feet and keep rehydrating so I could start the day off with full water. I called both motels in town and they were full. Argh!!!! I guess this means walking the 2.5 miles back to the trailhead and into the woods. I headed back the way I came and stopped at the gas station to buy another Gatorade. It was dark at this point and I put my head lamp on to to continue walking out of town. I got to the gap and began the climb up which luckily was not too rocky but steep. The whole way I was looking for anywhere to camp but no luck. I reached the top of the ridge and the rocks began almost worse than the other side. Small jagged little pyramids sticking up. Walking over this is so much harder in the dark and almost more painful. After two miles of walking and seeing no campsites I finally see two headlamps. As I approached they said who is it. As soon as I heard the voice I knew it was c-sharp. I asked is there room and do you mind if I crash here. Blue, sailor, sea sharp and jack rabbit were there. I hadn't seen Jack rabbit since North Carolina and was surprised I caught up to him. He's a fast hiker and apparently has been lazy the last two weeks or so. I set up my tent and basically crashed after the gang offered me a shot or two fireball. What a long tough day. The one positive is New Jersey is only 15 miles away.","Palmerton

I got up packed at a pop tart and got on my way. C-sharp, jackrabbit, blue, sailor were either still asleep or just getting up. I got on trail at 8:30 and instantly was cursing the rocks. I think I have slightly bruised my feet from the repeated onslaught. I traversed 5 miles and came to wolf rocks which were an outcrop of rocks along a small cliff line. Basically rock hoping similar to what I had three days ago. There was an ok view. The trail then descended down to fox gap where I was able to fill up on water that an angel left trail side. I continued on stopping at Kirkridge shelter for lunch. The rest of the gang from last night showed up one by one. I rested for about 45 minutes and pushed on with several small ups and downs passing over a gravel road, several power lines and a gas pipe line. The trail then followed and old road which finally gave relief from the PA rocks. The road lead you to the summit of Mt Minsi and then I had a long descent into the town of Delaware Water Gap. The trail lead right into town before turning and heading towards I-80 and the bridge. There was a hostel at the mountain church so I started heading that way when I bumped into Jackrabbit. We both walked over to the hostel and dropped off our packs. I was able to take a shower and to soak my throbbing feet. After the shower I headed to the diner for dinner and then back to the hostel to pack up and head out. Jeffs parents are meeting me for dinner tomorrow night so I wanted to get some miles in before tomorrow. It was only 14 miles to the water gap so I wanted to get some more in under my belt. I took off around 6:45 from the hostel and headed down the street toward the interstate. The trail crosses over the bridge next to the highway on a sidewalk with a Jersey barrier between you and the traffic zooming by. Several people honked and waved out their sunroofs and I waved back. I must of been a curiosity factor as people were slowing down to look at me waking and taking pictures of the Jersey sign. Traffic got a bit backed up behind me. Whoops!! I crossed the bridge passed the Kittattiny visitor center and the trail went into the woods. I had 3.4 miles to walk to the backpacker campsite. In New Jersey you can only camp in designated sites. The trail was an easy grade with great footing. About 1 mile the PA rocks returned. Nooooooooooooooooo I thought we were done with this. They lasted all the way to the campsite and my feet instantly started to throb. I hope they are not that much further tomorrow. Everyone said they were done at the state line. The campsite was in a grassy open setting with views to the west. I got an epic sunset for my first night in Jersey. Let's see what tomorrow brings.","Stealth Campsite

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542740,"I woke up at the backpackers campsite around 7:30. I packed up my gear and got on trail by 9 o'clock. I knew the day was going to be hot and humid. The temperature was already 80 at 9 o'clock in the morning. The trail had a steady descent down to Sunfish Pond. The trail went all around the pond and the Pennsylvania rocks returned. Gosh I thought I was done with these. After looping around the pond the trail began an ascent up Kittattiny Mt. Once on the summit of the mountain there were 360° view. The trail then began a descent to camp road. Once across the gravel road the trail began an ascent. I met another thru hiker Who started June 1. He told me he was hiking 30 mile days. At this point the temperature was close to 90° and it was hot. My plan for the day was to reach US 206. Jeff's parents and brother were down in Pennsylvania and we're going to pick me up for dinner. The plan was to meet around 5pm. The trail followed the ridge line for several miles. There were great views down into the valley. The trail descended again to a paved road and passed a swamp before climbing again back up to the ridge line. Once on top of the ridge there was a flat stretch for about 4 miles which made the walking fantastic. My friend Garret texted me to let me know that there was a severe thunderstorm about 40 miles to my west and was bearing down on me. I descended down to another road where there was a spring .10 east. I was just about out of water and filled up. On my way back to the trail you could hear the thunder in the distance and the storm was on its way. I put my pack cover on and my gaitors and continued on walking. The storm hit and boy did it poor. It felt good to cool off but then it became a flood in the trail. Made walking a bit of a challenge. Thankfully the worst of the storm went to my south. The rain stopped but the flooded trail continued. The trail had descended slightly at this point but climb up a cliff like structure with hand holding and climbing. With wet rocks it was a challenge but I was thankful it still want pouring. At the top I sat on a rock and took off each boot and poured the water out from them and rung out my socks. I continued on and dark clouds were on the western sky. Oh boy round 2. This time the storm hit me head on with high winds, heavy rain and thunder and lightening all around. Luckily I was on an old road following the ridge line. I was kinda under cover but not on the open ridge like I was between storms. Phew. Flooded trail became a river and I just sloshed right through it. Finally the storm passed and again I sat and took my boots off pouring out water and then ringing out my socks. It finally became dry enough to take my phone out and I had a text from Jeff's dad asking how far out I was. I was about 4 miles and they said they were on their way from Pennsylvania. I kept on trucking. I had three mini climbs one bring rattlesnake mountain. So three ascents and three descents. Almost like a mini Rollercoaster. By the third climb I was running out of steam. The in-laws texted that they were in town and we're just looking for the trail head. I continued on and then another text from Jeff's brother Doug that they found the trailhead and he was starting up. Finally after about 20 minutes I see Doug in the distance. Yay!! Wohooo! We walked together the mile downhill to the car were mom and dad were waiting. I was so excited as I haven't seen these guys in three months. I was pretty exhausted, sore feet and hungry. I took off my wet boots and socks and put on my sandals. We all got in the car and drove down the street to a diner. I proceeded to order everything under the sun. We ate, talked and laughed. I actually couldn't finish everything so I took it with me to go. We drove back to the road crossing of the trail and I walked up the AT with Jeff's dad to a parking area where I met Doug and mom who drove the car there. I found a good tent site, set up the tent threw my gear in. Doug helped me hang my food bag and I said my goodbyes as another thunderstorm was rolling in. They headed back to the Catskills and I laid in the tent watching the light show and passed out. I think I did 23 miles today.","Backpackers Campsite Worthington State Forrest

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542900,Today my step mother Cathy and her sister Jill are driving down to meet me on the trail. The plan was to meet at High Point New Jersey at the parks headquarters at 2. I got up and packed up my wet tent. There was a thunderstorm last night and then more rain during the night so the tent was still pretty wet. Shoved everything in my back and headed on trail at about 8:30. My only real climb if the day was up to the Culver Fire Tower which offered nice views. The day was warm but not humid which offered great visibility. I stopped at Gren Anderson Shelter to fill up on water. I then climbed up Sunrise Mt which wasn't to much of a climb where there was a Pavilion on top. There were views to the east and west. On my way up Karma came up behind me. I haven't seen her since Erwin TN and if you remember she was part of the group at Whistling Gap. The night of the crazy winds and she was one of the people who was in her tent and felt the ground lift as the wind blew hard and the roots were lifting up and down in the ground. She was slack packing with pace as she lives in New Jersey and her family was running the slack pack for her and a few other hikers. About 4 of us were at the pavilion and had snacks. I started off again around 11:30 and had 9 miles to go to High Point Headquarters. The trail for the next 5 miles followed the ridge with several small ups and downs. I passed many ledges which offered nice views into the valley. The last 4 miles were like a mini Rollercoaster as there were many ups and downs. Each up though had a nice view. My timing was off and the last two miles took me much longer than I anticipated so I didn't reach the headquarters till 2:45. I did have my phone snd was able to message Cathy to keep her up to date on my progress. It's hard on the trail to estimate timing sometimes. I arrived and met Cathy and Jill. We drove to the Hampton Inn and checked. Cathy got me my own room which was wonderful. The hotel was doing a free dinner buffet for guests that night so we had dinner there. We went to Walmart so I could resupply. Then bought some angry orchard and went back to the hotel and swam. We all crashed about 10pm.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542974,"I woke up on my birthday in the most comfy bed ever at the Hampton in. Can I pack this out with me please. I got up SHOWERED and got dressed and semi packed. Cathy, Jill and I were going to meet for breakfast at 8 am. Right on schedule there was a knock on the door and I headed down to breakfast. Great hot buffet breakfast and I loaded and carbed up. Headed back to the room to pack all up. Cathy knocked on the door which was ajar and came in. I was ready to go and did one final check of the room to make sure I didn't leave anything as I had everything scattered about. I ran my foot along the bed to make sure there was nothing in that little gap. Out popped a black sock which I was like oh no I almost forgot my liner sock but then I saw purple thong underware. Uhm?!?? Cathy said is that yours and I was like nope the sock isn't and neither is the purple thong. We will just ignore that. We packed into the car and headed to High Point. I had them take a picture in front of the high point sign for my go-fund me campaign I'm running for the Catskill Center for the Catskill Park as part of my hike. The New York-New Jersey trail conference is going to promote it as I'm in New Jersey and soon to be in New York and I'm a member and volunteer of the club. We took a bunch of selfies the three of us and I said my goodbyes and headed back on trail. There was a steady climb up to more rock ledges which offered great views and the trail arrived at an elevated platform which gave you 360 degree view of the monument and the valley below. I continued on and took the side trail up to the High Point monument. Great views from the top. Pete Jeff's dad texted me and we decided to meet at Gemmer Road where the AT crosses. The trail had a steady downward and went through nice woods and then fields and then woods again. I would have never guessed New Jersey was so beautiful. It's actually becoming one of my favorite sections on the trail from the bridge to high point. I continued along passing one paved and 2 gravel roads. I stopped at High Point Shelter for a privy run along the way. I arrived at Gemmer road crossing and only had to wait about ten minutes when Pete and Doug pulled up. They brought with them roast beef sub, Starbucks, 2 bottles of Mountain Dew, Funyuns, twizzlers and a doughnut. Wow now that's what I call lunch!!! We sat and all ate lunch. Doug then suited up with his boots and we slacked packed a few roads over where Pete parked the car and walked in until he met us. The trail was well laid out and had great maintenance to it. I'm loving this section as well. We all walked back to the car and picked the next jump. Doug and I went on and Pete drove to the next pick up location. This part of the trail was great. Woods, then field, road crossing, then woods, field, old railroad bed, bird sanctuary The Wahkill which the trail walks around it like a square. We saw blue Herron, geese and even a coyote which I thought was someone's dog at first. We met up with Pete on the other side of the wetland area. We walked back towards the car and came across a cooler. Yay trail magic on my birthday. Cold soda and cold beer!!! One soda for now and one beer for tonight. We reached the car and I said my goodbyes. I headed into the woods. Only had a .50 mile climb up Pochuck mountain to shelter. When I arrived I saw Badger who I hadn't seen since Port Clinton. I set up my tent and chatted with him while I drank my beer. Got in my tent and am crashing. While writing this the coyotes are chirping up a storm behind me up the hill. So neat to listen to them talk.","Hampton Inn on tri state border.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543191,"Sorry this was late it failed to post last night. I woke up at Pochuck Mt Shelter at around 6:30. I didn't want to get out of bed. I finally got up and packed and on trail after a mega big cup of coffee. I hit the trail at 7:30 and my first big climb was up the rest of Pochuck Mt. The climbing was steady and the trail laid out well do it was easy climbing. I descended down and crossed a gravel road and then county road 565 and then county road 517. I have to say New Jersey has been beautiful and it's one of my favorite sections of the trail thus far. I also have to say since coming into New Jersey trail Angels have been leaving us water at every road crossing. It's been amazing and so helpful because nothing is flowing. Once I crossed county road 517 I entered into the infamous boardwalks that I've heard so much about and they held up to my expectations. Wow!! It was hot in the sun but still so pretty. So many turtles,birds and other wildlife. Crossed over a suspension footbridge and back into the woods. The trail was relatively flat wandering through the forest. It abruptly reached a fence stile and into a field. Literally once climbing over the stile I was in a field surrounded by cows grazing. They all looked up at me with a WTF look on their faces. I think I startled them. Ha ha on you cows. I crossed the path and reached the crossing for NJ 94. This is where Heaven Hill Farm is. I walked the .10 to the farm and had a Caesar wrap and ice cream. I rested for 45 minutes as the day was starting to get hot. I got a text from my best friends wife Danielle that she was on her way down from Massachusetts with her two girls to give me support. I feel so loved. We planned to meet up at around 2. I pushed on hiking up Wawayanda Mt. and boy was it a climb. It was a 1000 foot gain in less than a mile climbing up boulders and ledges and many many stairs. They call this part the stairway to heaven. It was a really neat walk but hot so not as enjoyable as it would be in the fall. At the top a side trail takes you to Pinwheels vista which gives you fantastic views into the valley. I moved on descending the other side. I passed by wawayanda shelter and made it to Warwick turnpike and Danielle was waiting. Wohoo!! She had cold water and cold drinks. She took me to the post office to get my package and then to get food. We got back to the trail head where she slack packed me for 9 miles. Miss calculating how long it would take I was walking in the woods in the dark with my iPhone light on. When she picked me up at 8:30 at the trailhead on 17a she said I booked a suite at the Hampton Inn. OMG your the best I said. There was a whirlpool tub in the room and a jacuzzi and indoor pool. We went thru Wendy's drive thru and headed to the hotel. We ate, watched some tv and went to the pool. Danielle you rock and are such a great person for doing this.","Pochuck Mt. Shelter

Woke up in the Hampton Inn at about 8:30. I was beat from my 21.5 mile day in the sun and heat. I showered and Danielle did the same after me. The girls were still asleep when Danielle took me back to the trail. We stopped in the lobby for free continental breakfast before we got in the car. Danielle brought me back to 17a and I put on my tiny backpack and headed back onto the trail. The plan was for me to hike about 9 miles and have them pick me up at East Mombasha road. I headed into the woods and it was already super hot at 10am in the shade. The climbing again resembled a mini Rollercoaster with steep ups and down along rock ledges and rock climbs and scrambles. Some nice views up top but I didn't stay long on the exposed rock ledges. I went up eastern pinnacles, cat rocks and then to Fitzgerald falls which was bone dry so no falls. I slowly went up Mombasha high point in the full sun for much of the time. I was sweating heavily and drinking lots of water. At some points during the day I had to toss my trekking pole and Smitty up over my head and use my hands to climb. It was really interesting but in the heat not so much. I descended down to East Mambasha road and Danielle was waiting. I had trail magic too. Wohoo. I repacked my bag and took the big bag and put it back on. Ugh. Josh from the trail conference was going to pick me up and Danielle was going to take the girls to the city. I headed back out into the woods and it was even hotter. It was slow going and I drank lots and lots of water. Up down, up down, up down. It continued and the terrain was tough. Neat and really pretty but tough in the heat. I finally got a text from Josh saying he was leaving work and we agreed to meet at route 17 right at Harriman State Park. I took off my bag and sat resting against my packs. After about 15 minutes in the distance I heard a horn honking continuously. It got louder and louder and I was like ok someone's horn got stuck on. No it was Josh driving up route 17 honking all the way to let me know he was coming. We headed to his house and him and his wife made me the best tacos ever. We talked for hours about my adventures and settled down for the night at 10. Josh thru hiked in 2001 so it was nice to exchange stories. Tomorrow is supposed to be a high of 96.","Hampton Inn

Melissa drove me back to the trail at around 10 am. Danielle was still down with the kids and was going to met us to slack pack me again. I have been so spoiled through this section of trail. However it's been a blessing to have the support in this stretch. It's been so hot I wish I could slack pack all my friends. I did put the word out to leave water near trail heads in New York so hopefully it gets out there. I have seen lots of water at road crossings so it was nice to see. I said goodbye to Melissa and packed my mini pack. Danielle was going to meet me 5.1 miles away. With the heat it was slow going but so much easier with a lighter pack. I immediately crossed over I-87 and headed into Harriman State Park. I had 4 ups and downs which were steep. I went through the lemon squeezer which was a set of rocks close together where you squeeze through. Thank god I didn't have my big pack as it would be very challenging. After the lemon squeeze the trail went up a rock which require some climbing. It was the first time on the AT where I was like I don't think I can't do this. There was an easy bypass but I was like I can't skip a piece of the trail. I studied the rock. If I put my hand here and put my foot here and pull up while putting my foot on a tree. It worked except for right foot slipping I pulled myself up. Yay! That was a toughy. I stopped at fingerboard shelter for a rest and moved on. I met Danielle at Arden road and she took me with the girls to get lunch. After lunch I got dropped back off. I said goodbye and took some pictures with the girls. They headed out and back to Massachusetts. I am so thankful for them coming down and finding me and slack packing me for two days. I headed back into the woods and had 7.9 miles to go. The trail went up and down some more hills. I stopped at William Brien Memorial Shelter for a rest. I moved on and had to cross the Pallidades Parkway which was the most terrifying part of the AT to date. You cross two lanes then two lanes again. I stopped at the rest area in the medium to fill up on water. The crossed the two lanes of the parkway and headed up west mt. Black mountain right before the parkway had views of New York City skyline. The climb up west mt. was intense but pretty. I took the .60 side trail to the shelter and set up my tent with views of the city. I sat on a rock as dusk descended and watched the city lights come on. It was really pretty. Later on as I laid in my tent there were fireworks in the valley in front of the city and lightening going across the skies behind the city as there was a thunderstorm out at sea. It was a great day.","The Howard's

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543552,"Woke up at 7:30 to views of New York City. The group of campers that were there from the night before were up early for the sunrise and we're kind of noisy. I did wake up at 5:15 and went back to bed. I finally got up and packed and on trail by 8am. I was meeting Lourdes at 10am on the summit of Bear Mt. She follows my journal on here as well as my Facebook page of ""Moe Hikes the Appalachian Trail"". I walked the .60 miles back to the AT and followed the ridge of West Mt to views of bear mountain. I descended down and across a road to begin the ascent of Bear Mt. The New York New Jersey Trail Conference had done a lot of work on the AT in Bear Mt putting in many stone steps to help prevent erosion. The stonework was beautiful as I began my ascent. At one point the AT followed the old auto road up the mountain that has been abandoned. It then branched off and began climbing via more stone steps. I reached several rock ledges with views south to West Mt. The trail crossed more rock ledges as it wound its way up to the summit. On top of Bear Mt there is a tower that gives great panoramic views. On the south side of the tower I met up with Lourdes and her husband and two other hikers. She brought me a turkey sub, fruit and angry orchard. Wohoooooo talk about a mini party on the summit. We sat and ate and talked about my adventures. After about an hour we all walked down from Bear Mt together to the parking area. I reloaded up on water the Lourdes had in the car and thanked and hugged her. It so wonderful to have all this support as I head north. After I parted ways Jeff and Doug were on their way to meet up with me. Cell service was spotty so we had a hard time communicating. The last text I received they said the parking lot for Bear Mt was full after I told them I was standing at the inn. I continued walking north but they had parked and walked to the inn. However our texts to one another were not going through. Finally Jeff was able to call and he said stay where you are and I will walk to you. At this point I was in the Bear Mt zoo and the trail walks right through the zoo. I sat on a bench and Jeff found me. Doug drove the car from the parking area and went over the Hudson River via the Bear Mt bridge and parked where the AT goes back into the woods. He walked towards us while Jeff and I walked over the bridge. I passed the lowest point on the AT. It was a super hot day at this point. We reached Doug's car and I swapped to my mini pack so I could slack pack while Jeff walked with me. Jeff and I walked up Anthony's nose while Doug moved the car ahead and walked in to meet us. Jeff and I walked up to the ridge and then took a side trail out to Anthony's nose which gave views of the bridge and the Hudson River. We headed back and meet up with Doug and walked back to the car. I decided to head home for the night and take a zero. I wanted to see family, the dogs and the two cats. I also wanted to head to LL Bean to swap out my pack which was definitely worn. We headed to the Catskills and had a BBQ at Jeff's parents house. Seeing the cats and Sandy was pretty emotional as it had been almost 4 months away. Dinner was fantastic and it was nice to relax. Monday's forecast was for heat index to be near 100 and severe thunderstorms so it was probably a good day to take a zero. Some updates on my trail family and familiar names you all know. Luigi and her clan have entered Pennsylvania and reached the 1/2 point and did the half gallon challenge recently. They are about to get into the heavy rock zone. The royal couple last I heard were in Branchville New Jersey at a pub. Dragon Head is currently only 3 miles behind me so I hope to catch up with him tomorrow. Gasket is back on trail after going home for 4th of July and is in Penn at Eckville shelter. Ompi is still at home in southwest Florida still figuring out health issues with his partner. Otter is also at home in Aiken SC doing physical therapy for his knee and back. I'm hoping to have more familiar faces catch up to me soon.","West Mountain Shelter

Sometimes when people go home to visit they don't come back to the trail. Don't worry as I am writing this I'm in the car on my way back to the trail. The kitties snuggled with me and it was really nice. I got up and got picked up by the in-laws and we headed to the Catskill Center to visit people. We sent out the word I would be there at 10am. After spending sometime at the center we headed to lunch in Margaratville. Lunch was good I ended up with a cheesesteak and mozzarella sticks. After lunch we headed back to my house and the in-laws dropped me off at home. I relaxed for a few hours and then Doug, Jeff and I headed to Albany NY to LL Bean so I could swap out my pack as it had some wear and tear. LL bean was great and swapped it out no problem.

I got picked up and we stopped at the village market in Tannersville and I got the breakfast hero sandwich. Carb load up if necessary. We headed down the thru way back to the Bear Mt area. I got driven into Fort Montgomery so I could pick up my package from the post office there. We drove back over the Bear Mt bridge across the Hudson and back to Manitou road where I had stopped on Sunday. Dragon head started his morning at Fort Montgomery and was about 3 miles ahead of me. I hope to catch him today. I started on trail with Jeff's dad driving ahead to meet me. There was one kind of steep climb up to the ridge and then relatively flat on top. 3 miles and the trail descends down to US 9 and the intersection of 403. There was a shell gas station at the intersection so I stopped and had a snack. Dragon head had just been there about 15 minutes earlier and had texted me he was moving on. After my snack I moved on with several ups and downs. When I reached Old Albany Post rd Jeff's dad was there with several other hikers chatting and with Dragon Head. I stopped and at my lunch and hiked on with Dragon head still getting slack packed. Several other roads later I finally met Jeff's dad for the last time at Dennytown Road. I filled up on water and said my goodbyes and Dragon Head and I continued on. The plan was to make it to Fahnestock State Park. We had several steep ups and downs on our way and finally we reached and crossed NY 301 and saw the lake on the other side. The trail looped around the lake and on the far side there was a beach. On the service road to the beach we found a nice stealth spot and set up our tents. Near the beach there was an outdoor shower which was nice to use. The lake itself was so low water level wise it didn't look pleasant to swim in so we skipped that. We both ate dinner and headed to bed at about 8:45.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543771,"Today was going to be the day I walk through my old stomping ground for a few summers. From Fahnestock State Park through Stormville New York. Jeff lived and grew up near the AT in Stormville New York. I spent much time in the area when visiting him for the 15 years his parents lived in the area after he moved to Massachusetts. Dragon Head and I woke up around 7:30 and got up and made breakfast. I tried out the new VIA from Starbucks that my friend Heather sent me from Vermont. It was darn good. We both headed up to the concessions and bathroom area waiting for it to open so we could fill up on water. We got on trail about 9:30 and trucked the 5 miles to RPH shelter and rested for a bit. When we arrived Coach, Heavy-D, c-sharp,jack rabbit were all there. They had ordered Chinese food which apparently can be delivered to the shelter. Dragon head and I rested for about 20 minutes and trekked on. We crossed under the Taconic State Parkway and it was very surreal for me to have walked from Georgia and be in an area I knew so well. I told Dragon Head how when I first started coming down to this part of New York the Taconic was very dangerous. As thru hikers you had to cross all 4 lanes of traffic in one shot. Many of the roads cross all 4 lanes and some exits were a right turn 90 degrees into a side street. There were no exit or entrance ramps and you did all of the above with traffic going 70. When the speed limit is 55. The lanes are not normal size highway lanes but skinny just about the width of your car. Driving it to date is still uncomfortable. From the Taconic state parkway the trail begins a Steep climb up to Hosner Mountain road. The trail descends down to the road (again very surreal as this road was the back way to Jeff's parents house) and then it climbs steeply again up to route 52. When I was at RPH I told everyone at route 52 there was a deli Mountain Top and a Pizzeria only .40 away from trail. C-sharp caught up to us just before 52 and the 3 of us walked down to Mountain Top. When we got there 5 other hikers had gone that way after hearing me talk about it. Dragon Head and I split a large pizza and a 2 liter bottle of Mt Dew. While sitting and eating pizza another 10 or so hikers showed up all from RPH shelter. I bought a bunch of drinks from the Deli and chugged those down. After eating we both felt like it was nap time. I took my foam pad and headed behind the building where they have a grassy area. Heavy-D was laying on the grass napping so we followed suit. Slowly one by one hikers came behind the building and laid down as well. It was a sea of napping hikers on the grass. A funny sight to be had. One memory I have from Jeffs parents house were they always had rolls from Mountain Top. I bought 4 to pack out with me and a Mt Dew. Dragon head and I packed up and headed out by 4. We climbed out of route 52 and entered a field with views of the Catskills... Yay home. We continued on with some sharp little climbs up to small rock ledges finally arriving at Morgan Stewart Shelter. This shelter is one that both Jeff and his brother Doug maintained as kids. I ate a cold dinner of rolls and ready made rice. Both Dragon head and I headed to bed about 8:30. Tomorrow we plan on going 16 or 22 miles to one of the shelters. We may split a room in Wingdale if we end up with terrible stormy weather. That remains to be seen. For now off to bed.","Clarence Fahnestock State Park

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543911,"Woke up at 5:30am at Morgan Stewart shelter. Gosh way to early to get up so I rolled over and went back to sleep. I did finally get up at 6 and packed up and had breakfast. Dragon head had gotten up a bit earlier and was ready before me. The mosquitos were so bad he needed to push off before me as they were swarming him. I couldn't even finish my coffee as they were relentless. I pushed off from Morgan Stewart at about 6:45. The trail this morning was mostly downhill we a few tiny climbs. I crossed over depot hill, a set of railroad tracks and across route 55. The trail then went 1/2 way around nuclear lake. I guess the lake had been contaminated many years ago and it was a superfund site and has since been cleaned up. I stopped at Tekephone Pioneer Shelter for a snack and to sign in at the log book. The trail descended down to county road 20 where the Dover Oak is. This is the largest oak on the trail at 20 feet around and estimated to be 300 years old. In another mile or so the trail crossed NY 22 where there was a nursery on the left. The nursery lets hikers rest in their gazebo. They sell cold drinks, some resupply and they let you refill on water out back of the building where they also have a outside shower. I met up with Dragon Head here and about 14 other hikers. I bought two cold drinks and sat on the gazebo. It was getting really hot so I also took my shoes and shirt off and rinsed off in the cold shower to cool off. We learned there was a food truck on the other side of the building and a bunch of us went over and bought lunch. I got a hot dog and a soda. After about 45 minutes DH and I continued on. The trail wound through a field for about a mile and it was hot. We had a steep climb after the field and up to a ridge. We followed for three miles. IClunked my head on a dead branch overhanging the trail as my pack caught it and pulled it down on my head. I gave myself a god size bump and a scratch but nothing major. It was really the first blood I drew on the trail so not bad for 1450 miles. We stopped at Wiley Mt shelter and canmeled up on water and refilled our bottles. From the shelter we only had 4 miles to go. We met up with Eagle who ended up walking with us to Ten Mile River Shelter. After two miles we reached the sign welcome to Connecticut the gateway to New England. The shelter has the river next to the shelter snd we were able to jump in and cool off. It was nice but the water actually wasn't too cold. It goes to show how warm it really has been. We made dinner and settled in for the night. I had been dealing with a stomachache most of the day. I figured it out it's probably due to being dehydrated from the heat yesterday do it was most likely constipation. Which made sleeping uncomfortable adding in the mosquitos. DH and I decided to crash in the shelter as with the impending soaking rain we didn't want to deal with wet tents. Our plan is Kent tomorrow and Trooper is supposed to be coming to New York and Jeff is going to bring her to see me tomorrow. It's been since April 15 the day she left the trail that I have seen her.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544001,"Today was another great day on the trail. The day started off to rain though my terrible stomachache had improved as I drank lots of water through the night. Dragon Head and I shared the shelter together with another woman. It was a hot night of sleeping at first and buggy till the rain started and cooled off. The woman at the shelter was a character and was the oddest non hiker I have met on the trail. She was nice but very curt to us when we arrived. She was from New York City with very little food, 6 glass bottles of iced tea and a small backpack. She had no sleeping pad or bag and used a gossamer covering when she slept. I don't think she liked the way our clothes smelled and asked us to lay them on the grass. I said I can but when it rains I don't want them covered in mud. I felt bad but there is not much we can do out here mid hike. She lightened up when 10 more Thru hikers showed. She definitely was a character and talked a lot of split personality disorders. DH and I (Dragon Head for short from here on out) headed out about 8:30 as the rain had stopped. It's nice when you get a spot in the shelter as it makes it so much easier to pack up. This is the third day DH and I have walked together and I really like him and get along with him. After the initial two days of talking about the basics like family, jobs, trail life we have moved into more philosophical conversations. We both come from very different backgrounds yet have very similar beliefs and attitudes towards life. What I have enjoyed about DH has been the company. 90% of my time on the trail has been hiking alone. Luigi and I hiked several days together but mostly at our own paces and met up for snacks, lunch and camped together for a few weeks. Ompi and I hiked together for two days fully and the rest of the time set our own pace and would have lunch together and usually camp together as did the royal couple. Otter and I hiked together for a total of 5 days. I spent lots of time with him off trail such as trail days, Waynesboro etc. Dragon Head I can see myself staying with all the way to Maine. We hike the same pace, seem to pick when to do town stops the same and are very similar. I'm not sure how long we will be together but I'm enjoying it. The solo time on the trail has been wonderful and reflective and I've had lots of time to think. Hiking with someone after not for awhile has been really enjoyable, especially the conversation. We spent most of the morning deep in conversation covering a variety of topics. One thing I love about the AT is people are generally open to listen to one another and hear people's stories and thoughts. Not everyone is always going to agree but people out here are open and respect the difference in thought. We all have had different ideas about where we are headed as a society as we look at that society from the perspective of being cut off from it in small way. It's so interesting to hear people's thoughts on this. Anyway of tangent here. Deep in coversation we went up and down several climbs without noticing really. We caught up to Hazel who walked with us. I enjoyed her company as I believe DH did as well. We exchanged stories of some of the eccentric people out here on the trail. Many funny stories were exchanged and we had some good laughs. Now with three of us talking the time just zoomed on by. We had 9 miles to get to the town of Kent and we were there by 12:30. We walked the .80 miles into town hopping for a ride. No such luck and the town of Kent was not that far off the trail but it's nice to not have to walk extra. We arrived in Kent and DH went to the outfitter/ice cream place. I mean come on this is a hiker paradise. Soda, doughnuts, fudge, ice cream and resupply!!!! DH needed a new spork thing as his broke like mine did back in the Smokeys. They did not have titanium so he had to settle for a new same spork. I bought a soda and a doughnut as I could not resist. We the walked down main street looking for a bank for Hazel. Then headed to the laundry and Chinese food. The three of us put all of our clothes together and did one load. A dollar a person for to wash and a dollar to dry. Wohoo. We walked over to the Chinese place and a sign said closed for vacation till August 4th. Argh!!! So we walked Main Street looking for a place to eat. We found a pizza/pub and headed there. DH got the sin city burger and this thing was the height of a steak knife. It had 4 patties on it, it was huge. I went with the chicken bacon and ranch sandwich with extra ranch! Hazel had an apple walnut salad. Great food and good company. Hazel and I heard back to the laundry while DH went to the library to apply for jobs for his unemployment. We all ended up at IGA for resupply. We then brought everything to the laundromat and repacked our packs got our clothes and were off. The day got hot even though it was not supposed to be. Some guy on a bicycle asked us where he could buy Pot (marijuana). We we're like uhm yes we are thru hikers but no we have no idea. Try the ice cream shop I said. I dunno!?! I guess two guys in their 30's and a woman in her 40's look like the pot smoking type. We laughed pretty hard. I asked Hazel if she thought that this morning when she woke up that someone would be asking her where to buy pot. We left the town and I'm typical town leaving fashion we had the big climb. My shoes were bothering me at this point. I had swapped out my boots when I went home for a pair of trail runners that Doug had that were brand new. Well after almost three days they were causing my heels to get blisters so I need to swap them back to boots. Trooper is coming down and Jeff is picking her up tonight in Springfield MA. I get to see her tomorrow. Jeff will also bring my new old boots with him. This is the pair of hiking boots I've had at home that are two years old but only have 100 miles on them at the max. They are well broken in. We made it to the top of the ridge and after a few more ups and downs we had the steepest decent of the whole trail. I was in the lead and had to stop a few times to think ok how am I going to get past this. After some careful maneuvering we made it to a parking area. The trail followed a gravel road for about 2 miles. The black gnats suddenly were horrendous by this dirt road. I'm not sure if it was from the soaking rain we got last night but they were swarming. We arrived at the shelter and DH and I immediately stripped down and went in the Housatonic River to cool off and then set up camp. The three of us cooked and ate together and all crashed at about 9:30. I very much enjoyed my day with these two. Both DH and Hazel are very intelligent, funny and nice people. I don't know how long my time with them will be but when I think back on my AT hike Kent, CT will always be the day I spent with these 2.","Ten mile river shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544124,"Today I get to see trooper and Jeff. I'm so excited for that and to have sometime with both of them. I had a hard time falling asleep last night but once I did fall asleep I slept well. I woke up originally at 5:30, fell back asleep and got up for good at 6:30. I got packed up and had breakfast. Hazel got out early and said see you when you catch up to me. Dragon head was also up at this time and we chatted while we drank coffee. I went down to the river to filter water and it was so peaceful and beautiful. We both got on trail at around 8am. The trail was relentless this morning with many steep ups and downs. It was again another type of Rollercoaster and a part of the trail that no one seems to talk about. The new to me trail runners I was trying were killing my feet and causing lots of rubbing and small blisters had formed. Dragon head was ahead of me doing a good pave which usually I can keep. Not with these shoes. We caught up to Hazel and rested, had a snack and filtered some water. The trail continued with its ups and downs. We had a total of 9 of them. We all rolled into Pine Swamp Branch Shelter and ate lunch and rested. Only 6 more miles to meet up with Trooper and Jeff. We continue on and surprise more ups and downs though not as tough. The morning climbs really tuckered us out. We arrived at route 7 to where Jeff was parked and I got to finally see Trooper after many months apart. They brought Mt Dew, Gatorade, egg salad, rolls, bananas, oranges, cookies, brownies and so much more. I shared with Dragon Head and Hazel. The best part was we got to slack pack the 2 miles to town. We threw our packs inside the car and did the road walk and followed the river. The two miles felt like 10 minutes. We met Jeff and Trooper and continued to slack to the town where they met us at Toymakers Cafe where they allow tenting for free. The three of us got our tents set up as the rain was starting to fall. Dragon Head and Hazel headed into town to find water, clean up and food. Trooper, Jeff and I went to get dinner so I could spend some time with them. We ended up getting Chinese in the town of Cannan. It was nice and relaxing to be with them both. I got dropped back off to my tent at around 8 and thankfully it was still dry on the inside. They will be back again tomorrow to support me before Trooper heads back home. The Catskills are only 1.5 hour drive from where I was so not to long. I was so happy to see them and now I'm ready to crash.","Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544253,"Woke up to rather heavy rain at Toymakers Cafe. There were about 10 tents scattered on the grounds. The cafe opened at 7 so I headed over shortly after opening to get breakfast. Hazel was inside ordering when I went in. The place was small but had a great vibe to it. I ordered egg, bacon and cheese wrap and an iced coffee. Dragon Head, Tetris and joyride all wandered in and joined Hazel and I. The food was fantastic and the service exceptional. I would definitely come back here on a day trip. The rain let up and we rushed out to break our tents down. Just as we started the rain started back up again. Argh!! Hazel headed out first and then Dragon Head and I did. Joyride and Tetris were still behind when we headed out. There was a light drizzle as we walked. We headed by the falls on the Housatonic River which were very pretty. We caught up to Hazel and all hiked together. We climbed up Mt Prospect and I fell slipping on a root which was wet. No serious damage done but my knees were sore. Jeff, Trooper and Doug were going to meet me near Salisbury. We descended down Mt Prospect and reached US 44 where we had a road walk to town. Hazel left us and continued on the AT. Dragon Head was going to Nero and stay at Vanessa's where he has a package. I wasn't sure what I was going to do. Slack pack with Doug? stay at the hostel? Once we reached town with how sore my knees were, with rain I the way, a big climb outta town on wet rocks and not a lot of roads for slack packing I decided to stay at the hostel. It was a really short day but I didn't want to over do it. Jeff and the gang found me at the hostel. I took a quick shower and we headed out to eat and resupply me. The rain started back up as we made it back to the hostel. I said my goodbyes and got inside about 5:30. I spent the rest of the night relaxing watching Netflix. Tomorrow the climb up and over Bear Mt should be interesting, especially if it is raining.","Falls Village: Toysmaker Cafe tenting

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544308,"Slept on at Vanessa's later than normal. I got up at 7:30 and are a little bit of all of my food. I slowly packed up but in no rush. Dragon fly who is a south bounder stayed at Vanessa's last night and informed us that after the first creek there is no water going north for many miles. Dragon Head and I headed out at about 9am. We stopped at a Cafe for coffee and croissants and then got on trail. We had three big climbs today. Bear Mt, Mt Race and Everett Mt. 2 peaks over 2300 and one over 2600. These were the biggest climbs since Shanendoah in Virginia. The day started out cloudy but dry. It was still humid but not oppressive. We started up Bear Mt and the climb up was not terrible. It was steep but easy footing. Coming down Bear Mt was another story. We had heard rumors that it was extremely dangerous even when dry. We were a bit worried. It wasn't the extreme dangerous we were anticipating but it was tough as all the rocks were wet which made for a slow going. There were two points of the descent that I got nervous as we had to drop down between rock ledges and with the wet rocks I was worried of slipping. We made it down safely and then descended into Sages Ravine which was simply wonderful. It was a very pretty walk with the creek flowing through the ravine. It would of been nicer if the sun was out and everything wasn't damp. We continued on and at the end of the ravine we crossed into Massachusetts. Only 4 states left at this point and this is when dragon head and I started discussing water. We both commented that there had been many streams so far today and lots of water. Why did the south bounder say there was no water. I know it had been very dry but in the last 3 days we had received a good soaking of rain so things should be flowing. Why would we be told there was no water when today there is. We both have noticed people are stingy about their water. It tastes funny, it looks funny. I find it amazing that after 1500 miles people are still expecting Evian quality water from a stream. I mean I can understand in Georgia your initial resistance to water from a stream, creek, pond, but after this drought there are still water snobs out here. I feel info that is passed of ""there is no water"" is in reference to their own perception. That water is this that or the other thing so I'm not drinking it so there is no water out here. I know for myself I avoid stagnant water, water with strange colors to it, water that is coming out of a dump or chemical plant or from a superfund site. But a creek that is flowing albeit not at a marathon rate is still good water. Your hiking in the woods why are you being a water snob. We laughed at the absurdity of this. But it's happened since New Jersey people telling us there is no water yet there is plenty. Or people complaining the water tastes funny even when it comes out of a sink, pump or well. I'm just thankful for the water and I'm not going to get dehydration. We have dubbed these people water snobs. Ok moving on we began the climb up Mt Race which had an easy ascent. The top of Mt Race had .60 miles of open rock ledges with fantastic views. It started to rain at this point which made the descent down treacherous. There were a lot of smooth rocks most of the way down which made for some slow walking. Each step had to be methodically thought out so you didn't slip. We made it down and immediately headed up Mt Everett which had a steep smooth rock ascent which made it difficult with the rain. Slow going on the up but summited with no issues to not much of a view. We headed down and the trail was a smooth and steady descent. Thank you trail gods. We arrived at a picnic area where there was 2 coolers of ice water. We were able to fill up and move on without having to filter water. We arrived at Glen Brook Shelter at about 5:30. We decided to stay in the shelter as thunderstorms were on their way. Two south bounders arrived, well one south bounder and his brother who was out section hiking. They were both from Georgia and it was nice to exchange stories of what's happened, what's coming and what's good places to stay visit ahead. It was nice to chat while we ate. We found out from the SOBO's that they passed Hazel three miles before the shelter so we knew she made it down the rocks safely. I knew she would be fine but we both fell today and two points I was pretty nervous coming down the descent so I was thinking of her. We only did 14 miles today but the climbing was tough after not having to do it for awhile and having wet rocks. Tomorrow we are shooting for a 21 mile day.","Salisbury: Vanessa's House

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544521,"I woke up to the sound of rain falling on the tin roof. It's mornings like this you don't want to move. I finally convinced myself to get up. The shelter was a tiny one fitting only 4 of us. DH and I and the a southbounder with his brother. The plan was to push for a big day today as we did much shorter days the two prior. We ate breakfast packed up and headed out by 7:30. The day begin with a steady ascent down Mt Everett. It was steep and many open rock slabs that were very slippery from all the rain. It was super slow going and we caught up to Tetris who also was headed down slowly. You would reach a descent down open rock and look ""ok which way has the least possibility of death."" None of us got hurt and we made it down to the valley. Tetris, DH and I hiked together. We stopped at the ATC New England branch and I was a little disappointed. There was no log book to sign and we weren't even invited inside. We were able to fill up on water from the hose but it would of been nice to see their operations. In my book a missed opportunity to get thru hikers involved for after their hike. We continued on and the trail was relatively flat at this point passing through fields and pine woods. We reached US 7 where you could hitch into Great Barrington. On the Guthook app for the AT it said there was an antique store that sold soda. We were sold and walked the .20 down the street. We relaxed ate snacks and drank our liquid gold. The second part of the day would include the hike up East Mountain, walk through ice gulch, pass by Beartown State Forrest and Benedict Pond and finally up Mt Wilcox to the shelter. The climb up East Mt was a struggle. I'm definitely lacking something in my nutrition which is making me sluggish and weak at times. I'm gonna start taking a multivitamin when I can get some to me. I made it up East Mt and we followed the ridge line all the way to Ice Gulch Shelter. DH was ahead of me and I met back up with him at the shelter. We both ended up taking a nap at the shelter as we were beat after eating a late lunch. We moved on and I started coordinating with a high school peer of Jeff who has been following me on Facebook as to where to meet. She wanted to bring me pie that she had and to actually get to meet me. I picked beartown mountain road as a good spot as the trail crosses it. I told her I would text her as I got closer. We descended down out of ice gulch and crossed Lake Buel Road to trail magic put on by y-wham. I think I got the organization right. A nice cold drink, bag of M+M's and some other goodies. DH and I sat and relaxed and ate. We moved on passing MA 23 and another smaller road. We climbed some more and reached beartown mt road and though it was paved it was moss covered and clearly not operational. I messaged Amanda and said new meeting point. Beartown road and Benedict Pond. After some finagling we finally met each other and had pie. We chatted and ate pie and I moved on hoping to get to the shelter before dark. I said goodbye and continued on. The climb from the pond to the shelter wasn't too bad and I rolled in at just about dark. DH had gone ahead and had is dinner. Tetris was there as well as Old Spice, Axe and old timer. By the time I got there all the tent sites were taken. This spot had 2 shelters sleeping 6 and 12 and both were empty. The older shelter has no one in it. I would normally never do this but set my tent up in the shelter so I would not be eaten alive by the bugs. It was lights our for me by 9 with a full belly of pie.","Glen Brook Shelter

I would of tented in a heart beat if there was room. DH came over to the shelter to make breakfast as I was packing up. We got on trail at around 7:30 and the goal was to make it to Upper Goose Pond Cabin. I gave Tetris the remainder of the pie before I left and we kicked off. We had the rest of Mt Wilcox to climb over and then a steady descent. We continued on down before climbing up Cobble Hill with a vista to the valley below and the very small town of Tyringham. We crossed several foot bridges and came across fresh spring water and a cooler of sliced watermelon. We rested and had several snacks and ate with old spice, axe and old timer. After our respite we had the big climb of the day which was baldy mountain. The trail was steep with loose pine duff and roots which made it slow going. I fell back to the end of the pack as I am still feeling sluggish and like I'm dragging. I really must be low on something and need to figure that out. Dragon head boogied on ahead and I was like the boy took speed as he zoomed off. Great energy burst!! I followed up the rear and hiked with old timer who is from Ohio and old spice and axe who are father and son. The three of them stopped to take a break and I moved on. Descending down into Goose Pond area. The land around the pound used to belong to an outing club who donated it to the AMC to keep it forever wild. The AMC built and operate a cabin by volunteers for Thru hikers to stay at free of charge. The upstairs have 16 bunks. The first floor has a common room with a big fireplace and a kitchen. There is a big front porch with rockers and a picnic table. Outback there is a space to cook, eat, do dishes, and wash up. There are places to camp as well. The cabin also has 2 docks a beach to swim and 2 canoes to take out on the lake. The trail came down to the lake and you walk most of the way around the lake to get to the cabin. It is .50 miles off trail but so worth it. I arrived at 2:30 and dragon head was already there. I checked in with the caretaker and was able to get a top bunk. I made myself a late lunch and then took a nap. A few thru hikers were trying to figure a way out to order a pizza and asked if I wanted in. Heck yea! We ended up with 2 sheet pizzas as the pizzeria gave us a deal. 8 thru hikers ate a lot of pizza. After pizza I headed down to the dock and watched as the sun was getting low. Dragon head was sitting on the dock and I asked him if he wanted to take the canoe out. I got the key and we paddled around the lake. It was beautiful and amazing to see a lake in Massachusetts with no houses on it. We headed back to the cabin and had a snack and I headed to bed. I hear that in the morning we get pancakes.","South Mt Wilcox Shelter

I had emailed Doc Miller who is Kirk's great uncle. Kirk being the walking stick family just as clarification. Dragon head and I were going to be picked up at Angelina's sub shop at around 5 when I got into town and called him. I hoped my timing would be good as it's hard sometimes to estimate when you will arrive somewhere when walking 20 miles. We got packed up and the caretaker made all thru hikers coffee and pancakes. What a treat to have all of this done for us from the AMC. Dragon head and I got on trail at 7:30. The terrain for the day looked really good with no big climbs. Early on in the day we crossed over the Massachusetts turnpike. This was a HUGE milestone for me as I have been driving under this crossing for over 20 years and even more when Jeff and I lived apart. I always would daydream what it would be like to hike the AT and kicked myself for not attempting it after college. I stopped and did a small video to post on the web. We then climbed up and over Beckett and Walling mountains as well as bald top. We stopped at October shelter for a snack before the trail leveled out and was relative flat for 10 miles. We stopped at the cookie ladies house which is a u-pick blueberry patch and the woman who runs it often times has fresh baked cookies on the porch and allows hikers to buy cold drinks and fill up on water. Unfortunately the cookie lady was in town and we had no cookies!! We did stop and refill up on water and chat with the other hikers who were there. Old spice, axe, old timer, monarch, Peter Pan were just a few. DH and I moved on with only 9.5 miles to Dalton. The terrain continued to remain flat and we came to Blotz road where a trail angel was doing trail magic with cold sodas and snacks. We stopped and chatted with the trail angel and tumbleweed and foot long rolled in. We all sat and chatted for about 20 minutes before moving on. We quickly climbed up Warmer Hill where we got a view of Mt Greylock in the distance. I'm coming for ya I said to the air. Dragon head and I continued on with a slight descent down to Kay wood shelter where we stopped for a power nap and recharge. After leaving the shelter we had a short but steep climb before the descent down into Dalton. We crossed a set of railroad tracks and the trail then followed a residential street down to the downtown. We passed sweat peas and could not resist some ice cream. We then moved further on into town making it to Angelina's where we called Doc. He showed up in minutes and brought us to his house where we met Claire his wife. They were so wonderful to us letting us do laundry, shower and made us the best meal ever. We had grapes, salad, homemade mac and cheese, cheeseburgers, sausage sandwiches and pudding for dessert. Amazing! It was so nice to relax and get to know them both. Such good people. We also were staying the night and sleeping on a mattress with sheets simply amazing. I look forward to meeting up with them again in the future. It was such a great day of hiking, great weather and great company to share a meal with.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544788,Had the best nights sleep at the Millers house. I called Bascom Lodge on the top of Mt Greylock to see if I could make a reservation at the bunkhouse. I was told everything was booked so we won't be staying on top of the mountain. DH and I got up and packed up. Claire made us sandwiches and sliced up banana bread for us to take. She made us breakfast and gave us tons of food to get back on trail. Doc gave us a ride back to where we left the trail and we were off. They were truly remarkable and I am most appreciative of them putting us up. Our first climb was up and out of Dalton which was a gradual climb up Mt Crystal. We descended down off of Mt Crystal into the town of Chesire. We both had to stop at the post office for packages. Ompi had sent me a package from Florida. In his words he said I was to skinny and needed to eat more. My food bag was almost empty so it was a well needed addition and I was thankful. Thanks Ompi. Dragon Head had 4 packages and had lots of food. We packaged up our bags and started out. To see things were heavy was an understatement. On a positive we were going to meet Jeff's parents at a road crossing in a mile to slack pack up Mt Greylock. We arrived at outlook ave and no sooner that we took off our packs they pulled in. What timing on that! We stripped down our packs to bare minimum and left it all in the trunk of the car. We had 7 miles to go to the summit. They were going to go into town to have lunch and then meet us on the summit. Thank god we didn't have to walk up the hill with our packs. It wasn't terribly steep but it would of taken most of my energy going up with the weight. We made it to the summit around 4:30. We learned on the way up that there was a wedding all weekend on the summit and that was why everything was booked. Even the restaurant was going to be closed for dinner due to a rehearsal dinner. So Jeff's mom texted me to see if we wanted food from the cafeteria before it closed at 4. I said yes please. When we arrived on the summit we at least had burgers and beef brisket sandwiches waiting for us. We were able to take a shower at the lodge for 5 bucks. They at least had that option. We went back to the car and repacked our packs. I said goodbye to the family and we started our descent down to the shelter. We only had 3.4 miles to go which wasn't too bad. We arrived at Wilbur Clearing Shelter at about 7:30. Hazel was there and we were able to catch up on our hikes. I tried to eat more food from my food pack to lighten the load.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544893,"I heard rain drops at 5:30 in the morning on the tent and dove out to retrieve my clothes before they got wet. Hazel and Dragon Head were doing the same and we all went back to bed. The plan was to sleep in walk the 3 miles down the hill and have Chinese food and meet my mom and sister. The rain drops stopped immediately after we retrieved our clothes. At 7:30 I got up and was packing all the items inside my tent. Hazel had already left to begin the climb down and dragon head was also packing. I heard a few drops so I put my pack outside and the few items that go on top of the tent and food bag and got out of the tent to pack it. I pulled my rain fly off and the heavens opened up. Dragon head was able to pull out his stakes of his tent and run with his full tent and bag to the shelter. I however had to much loose stuff scattered about and trying to pack it I was already screwed. I packed up my tent which was soaked, I was soake and my pack was soaked. Oh well let's just get down this mountain. The descent down was not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. I caught up to Hazel and we walked into town. Dragon head was still at the shelter when I left. Hazel and slipped and fallen in a mud puddle and was headed to the YMCA and I wanted coffee and headed to a Getty gas station. After getting coffee I crossed the street to where the Chinese food buffet was. Next to the Chinese food was an empty price chopper grocery store. I spread out my gear to dry and hung my tent over the plant rod in front. Dragon Head arrived around 10:30 and Hazel had made it from showering to putting in her laundry. We got into the Chinese Food place as soon as it opened. My mom and sister arrived st 11:30 and joined us and we all had a good time. We laughed at the stories of my mom and her new smart phone and trying to figure out how to use it. After we ate we looked at the maps and we're going to slack pack 7.2 miles to county road. I emptied my pack and put a few snacks, 2 Nalgeen of water and my filter. Dragon head used my mini pack and Hazel went bag less and put waters in the mini pack. We got dropped off and headed back on trail. We had a 1000 ft climb and reached the Vernont/Massachusetts border. Only 3 states left and what a fantastic feeling. 3 miles in I get a message from my sister that attempting to drive county road she almost got stuck and a local said you can't get to the trail this way. So she decides to attempt from the other side. We trek on and go another 3 miles. Now I get a panicked message. The road from the other direction has a bridge out and she can't get there. So we now have to push on another 10 miles. Not the original plan but us thru hikers can handle anything. So instead of 7.2 it will be 18.1. Luckily I have my filter and filter us more water and we push on. We climb up Consulation Mt highest climb of the day at 2833. We keep boogieing to make it to Vermont 9 before dark. Our final climb up Harmon Hill gives us a nice view of the valley and then we have an extremely steep descent down to 9. It was dark at this point mostly in the thick woods and we took it slow and steady. We pop out of the woods and my mom and sister cheer. They had gotten two rooms at the Autumn Motel as they weren't planning on staying but didn't want to drive back this late. We were excited that we didn't have to try and set up tents in the dark or have to climb back up the other side. What a day.","Wilbur's Clearing Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545092,"My mother and sister are the best. Waking up in a motel room in a bed after our 18.3 slack pack day and nighttime decent was wonderful. Hazel, dragon head and I slept until almost 8am. I got up and took another shower because I could and packed up. We all piled into the van after continental breakfast and coffee. My mom and sister dropped us off at the trailhead and collected the coolers of trail magic they did the day before. I said my goodbyes and it was back into the woods for us. We had a big climb up to 3700 feet over 10 miles. There were several ascents and descents in between but the trail gradually went up over the ten miles. Climbing up out of route 9 I thought I was gonna drop from my pack weight. After slack packing for the last two days with full weight plus all the food I had it was a slow go. We stopped at the first shelter for a snack and to rest. We pushed on after I devoured a bag of Doritos and Mt dew. The climbing was slow and steady but nothing terrible after the initial climb. Once we were a mile from Goddard Shelter the trail became steep and climbed through a spruce and balsam forest. It smelled so good. Dragon head made it to the shelter first then me and turn Hazel. We took a break and loaded up on calories. We then had a .30 climb to the top of Glastenbury Mt which had a fire tower with a fantastic view. We took pictures and then began the descent to Kid Gore Shelter where we crammed three tents into space for two. We made dinner together and got into bed at 8:30. Tomorrow we do Stratton Mt which is almost 4000. Not sure if I mentioned this previously but we crossed the 1600 mile mark at the infamous county road. So exciting.","Autumn Motel

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545094,Woke up today around 5:30 am to running critters. Have no idea what they were but boy were they noisy. Shhhhhhh people are trying to sleep. I finally got up and packed up at around 6:30. I made coffee and had breakfast and the three of us got on trail at about 7:30. We all hiked 3.8 miles to Story Brook shelter where we took a rest and had a snack. It was 6.8 miles to the top of Stratton Mt. Summit. The trail was fantastic with an easy pitch and though there was climbing it wasn't horribly steep. With that said I was still dragging as 1600 miles has definitely taken a toll on my body. I plan on taking a day off in Manchester center. I need it terribly and need to eat and load up on calories. I think it's a good time to do so as we head into the bigger climbs. I took my time climbing up Stratton Mt and reached the summit. Dragon Head was already up there and we climbed up the fire tower together. The visibility was fantastic and the view was amazing. I took a lot of pictures. We then came down and ate a lunch and snacks. Dragon head headed out while I was finding accommodations for tomorrow night. DH's sister is coming up to see him in Vermont and he's staying a night with her and then taking a zero a green mountain home. Hazel is going to Nero in Manchester center and is staying at green mountain home. When I called they were full so I'm staying at a bed and breakfast in town. I finished booking and Hazel showed up. We hiked down the mountain and met dragon head who was at the spring getting water. We headed to Stratton Pond shelter. There is a 5 dollar fee to stay at this shelter and after looking at it we decided lets just hike 2 more miles and stay in our tents. The shelter is not enclosed and there is no bear pole or cables. Didn't seem to have much going for it. We passed the 3/4 way mark of the whole trail on our way down Stratton Mt and it was so exciting. We hiked to a footbridge crossing and there were great stealth sites to camp at and that's just what we did. We talked and figured out we only have 110 mile to New Hampshire and 235 miles to Maine. It's so crazy this journey is getting close to ending.,"Kid Gore Shelter.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545295,"Woke up to the sound of the creek. I slept really good and didn't want to move. We were planning on just going 8 miles to the town of Manchester so there was no rush to get out of the tent. I finally got up and packed and made coffee and ate breakfast. While I was packing up my tent Hazel headed out to stay ahead of us as she says she hikes slow. This lady can move and she is a strong hiker. Dragon head and I ate breakfast and got on trail at about 8:30. We only had 8 miles to go and one climb over Spruce peak. We caught up to Hazel at about 2 miles from from the road and all hiked together. We descended down to the road and came across a sign that said ""Caution do not become roadkill"". Route 30 apparently has two sets of lanes with speeding traffic on a blind corner. They recommend looking both ways while crossing and run. It was a hair raising road crossing especially with speeding tractor trailers. We made it safely across and Hazel went to chat with some hikers and their family. Soon enough we had a ride into town. We arrived into Manchester at about 12:30. The three of us all ate lunch at Cilantro. Hazel headed out to resupply and to go to Green Mountain house. Dragon heads sister picked him up around 2:30. I headed to Palmer House resort and motel. I checked in and got settled and headed into town to eat again and get coffee. I headed back to the motel and went to the pool.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545460,I slept in this morning as I had nowhere to be and no hiking. Well sleeping in meant 8:30 but that's late for me. I got up took a shower and headed to the continental breakfast the motel offered. I wiped them out but luckily not to many other guests were even taking advantage of the breakfast. I headed back to the room to grab by small day bag and headed into town. I stopped first at EMS to buy a new dry sack as a chipmunk or something like it chewed a hole in it while it was hanging in the tree. After I got my new sack I headed to Starbucks to get an iced coffee. It was delicious. I'm happy I decided to take a zero today not only is my body sore and needed a rest but it rained heavy all morning and it's raining again. I stopped in McDonald's for lunch and then headed back. I thought of taking a swim in between rain showers but Dragon Head texted me. He said his sister dropped him off at the library in the morning and had been there for two hours. He wanted to stop at Cilantro for lunch and asked if I wanted to join him. I said sure let me walk down that way. I got there within a few minutes and ordered chips and salsa as I didn't want to eat another full meal. Lieutenant Dan was eating when I walked in and dragon head was talking to him. He finally caught up to us and DH had been hiking with him for awhile before we started hiking together. I finally got to meet him and we all ate and chatted catching everyone up on the happenings. Jeff had texted me while I was at the restaurant that he was coming to do a surprise visit. He wanted to come on Sunday to slack pack us but there was no roads whatsoever. Seeing I'm heading further north and it will get harder to see one another he wanted to do a quick visit. Dragon head and I after eating walked down to the price chopper to do out resupply. We supplied for four days of food taking into account that we will be near two restaurants in those 4 days. We think that we actually have the right amount of food and not too much. We checked out and sat on a bench eating snacks we had bought ourselves. Dragon head called green mountain house to be picked up. This is the hostel I tried to get into but they were full. The guy was there shortly after and DH headed to the hostel. I headed back to the motel and went in the pool. The sun finally had come out and it got hot and sticky quick. I dried off and changed and Jeff arrived. OMG I was so excited to see him. We went and got a pizza and spent a few hours talking about my trip and what's going on at home. Around 7 Jeff got ready to head back to the Catskills. It was a little over 2 hour drive. Which was still very long and I can't believe he drove all that way just to see me. After he left I got into bed and watched tv until I fell asleep.,"Palmer House Resort

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545462,"I set my alarm for 7 as a just in case. I was worried I would sleep in really late. I snoozed a bit more and finally got up and packed it all up. I had scattered my whole pack all over that motel room. I checked out and returned the key and started walking into town. I stopped at Starbucks to get an iced coffee as it will most likely be my last until Hanover, New Hampshire. I sat outside drinking my iced coffee when Dragon Head texted me. He had gotten on trail around 8am and was on top of Bromley Mt. He said he wasn't sure of his end point but said he would go around 15. I told him I'd catch up. I finished my coffee and started walking down Main Street headed toward the trail. The trail is 5.4 miles from town and I hoped I would get picked up and not have to walk all 5.4 miles. I stuck my thumb out and proceeded to walk. I know some hikers just stand still with their thumb out or holding a sign but I feel if you show your willing to walk it people seem to stop quicker. Sure enough I only walked maybe 5 minutes and I guy in a truck pulled over and brought me to the trailhead parking lot. We didn't get to talk to much as a work phone call came in but I was most grateful for the ride as it was super hot out. I grabbed my pack and thanked the man and started towards the trail. I see out of the corner of my eye a van with AT symbols on it and I was like it can't be. Miss Janet!!! I had walked 1650 miles missing her by minutes or seeing her van drive by but there she was. Hunny do you want a soda she said. Yes please! I hugged her and proceeded to tell her how I had wanted to meet her but kept missing her. She was taking a lazy day but had been following the bubble north and was in Massachusetts the few days before. She is trying to catch up to people to give back some of their warm weather gear that she had been holding for them. Miss Janet was always ahead of me as the bubble was always ahead of me well at this point I have caught up to the bubble or the backside of it. Miss Janet is such a wonderful person and does so much for the hikers. She asked me ""do you have everything that you need"". I thanked her again and pushed off. The day started off with the climb up Bromley Mt which was 3 miles from the parking lot. The trail and grades were not too steep and in no time I had reached the ski slope and began the climb up from there. The trail followed the ski slope for .30 miles before reaching the summit. Wow what a view with the bluebird skies. It was hazy but you could still see far. I descended Bromley Mt down to Mad Tom notch and then started climbing up styles peak. The climbing on this was much steeper and the trail went through really thick spruce forrest. There was a small view at the top and then I descended down to a small notch before climbing up again up Peru Peak. This peak had a wooded summit so no view to be had. I climbed down stopping at Peru Peak Shelter and eagle was there having lunch. I asked him if he had seen Dragon Head and he said he had and that he left at around 1:30 from the shelter. Eagle said that DH was shooting for Little Rock Pond shelter. That would be a 20 mile day but dragon head got an early start more so than me. I didn't think I'd make it but decided to keep chugging on. I continued on climbing next up Bakers Peak. The climb was easy except for the last .10 miles where it was open ledge scrambles on an incline. There was a bad weather bypass so I always know they will be a tricky climb when there is a bypass. There was a blowdown across the trail and it was to high to step over and it was almost too low to go under. Needless to say I had kneel in the mud to duck under the tree with my pack on. I should have taken it off as it would have been easier but it looked at first it would be easy to duck under. No such luck. I stopped at lost pond shelter to wash my hands as they were covered in mud. It was only 1.7 to big branch shelter so I decided to push on. I thought Dragon Head might be at the shelter as the one eagle said he was going to was a fee shelter. On the descend down from lost pond shelter the trail followed the big branch creek. The trail crossed the creek on a footbridge and I could see a fantastic campsite and swimming hole right next to it with no one at it. That's gonna be home. DH I'll catch up tomorrow. I'm sure he caught up to Lt. Dan and they hiked together. That's what's nice about the trail, it's nice to hike with others and your trail family but sometimes due to circumstances you part ways or can't catch up and it's ok. You will see one another again. I walked over the footbridge and took a side trail to an awesome campsite. I quickly set up my tent and laundry line and stripped down to just my shorts and went in the cold cold creek. Boy did it feel good and there was a pool in the creek that was over waist deep. I was able to submerge myself and clean up the mud on my legs. I started a fire and made dinner. I climbed into my tent around 7:30 to write some trail journals. Tomorrow hopefully the rain holds off. It's supposed to be a rough wet weekend.","Palmer House Resort.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545524,"Woke up at 6am to the sound of Big Branch Creek. I slept like a rock last night and felt really good. I got up and packed up and packed up my tent. I made breakfast and got on trail at about 7. The first half of the day was a gradual climb. I passed big branch shelter and went to little rock pond shelter and stopped for a snack. The view from the lake was really fantastic. After little rock pond shelter there was a climb up to white rock cliffs. The trail then descended down to Vermont 140. From route 140 the trail ascended up Bear Mt which was a tough climb. The humidity at this point had gotten so high that it made it very slow going. I was drenched and completely wet. I had to walk a few steps and then stop and rest. I finally made it to the top of Bear Mt completely drenched. I drank a lot of water and then began the descent. It was steep and super slippery as all the rocks were sweating from the humidity. I reached Vermont 103 and headed west to Q's Whistle stop to have lunch. They served breakfast all day and I ordered everything. I finished it off with maple soft serve which was delicious. I checked the weather and the dew point was 74 and the temp was 85. It was hot as I was walking back on the road as the sun came out and was blazing. Once back to the trail I had a rock scramble climb up to a view point. Again it was super slow going and I finally made it up Beacon Hill. I was completely drenched yet again and almost couldn't drink enough water. There was a slight descent and then I began the climb up Killington. The plan was to stop at Governor Clement Shelter and continue the climb northward tomorrow. The climb up Killington was a gradual ascent and not too steep. Thank god as the humidity was getting even worse. About two miles from the Shelter I passed a sign that said 500 miles left to Katahdin. I cannot believe that is all that is left. Wow! I arrived at the shelter and Hazel, Dragon Head and Lt. Dan were all there. I got the last spot in the shelter and set up before anyone else grabbed it. I walked down to the creek to filter water and to jump in. There was a deep pool which I jumped into and my heart nearly stopped the water was so cold. I ate a cold dinner and chatted with everyone to catch up on their hikes. The rain has held off so far. Let's see what tomorrow brings.","Big Branch Stealth Site

It was north, south and east of us but luckily we were fine. The rest of the shelter got up at around 6 so I did as well. I made coffee and ate breakfast. I packed up and hoped the rain would hold off. I had no cell reception so I couldn't check the radar. I got on trail about 7 and was the third to last to leave. Only Dragon Head and Lt Dan were the only 2 left at the shelter when I left. The climb up Kilington from the south was steady but not steep. It was a very nice grade. Only near the top did it become somewhat steep and that was mostly step ups among the roots. We climbed up into the clouds and it was foggy and misty. Lt Dan and Dragon head caught up to me and we hiked together stopping at Cooper Lodge Shelter for a rest and a snack. After we began the 6 mile climb down Kilington to US route 4. The descent down was a good grade with the only steep part at the beginning. When we were 2 miles from the road the heavens opened up and it poured. We got soaked and all gathered by the road. Dragon head needed to go into Rutland for a package and Lt Dan and I said we would go to. Hazel did not need to go into town and was going to head to the state park to see about getting a lean to for us. In the state park you can rent lean-to's, cabins or tent sites. She told us she would text us when she got to the state park. I sat to empty my boots as the rain had stopped and the regional bus pulled over to see if we needed a ride. Lt Dan, DH and I piled on the bus and had to head north as the guy was at beginning of his route. The driver had the AC on high and we were freezing as we were soaked. After an hour bus drive we got dropped off at the bus depot in Rutland. Dragon head had to pick up his package at The yellow deli so we headed there to do laundry and shower. Lt Dan headed in a different direction and was in search of food. We showered put our laundry in and had Chinese for lunch. The dryer took awhile and we waited around for our clothes to dry. Hazel texted that the lean-to's were sold out but there was one cabin left for 50 and dragon head and I both said yes let's do it. We finally had dry clothes and got dressed and headed back to the bus station. We found out that the last bus left at 5:15. We headed to route 4 to hitch and a very nice lady picked us up within 5 minutes. We got back to the trailhead and headed into the woods. We only had 3.2 miles to the cabin in the state park. After 1 mile in we had a torrential thunderstorm with two lightning strikes really close. Dragon head and I were pretty scared and really tried to boogie to the cabin. The storm passed and we breathed a sigh of relief. We made it to the cabin and Hazel said you survived the storm. We were able to take another shower and get into dry clothes. We settled down and found out we could order pizza so we did just that. 2 large pizzas were on the way.

I fell back asleep and woke up around 7:30 to Hazel being up as well as Dragon Head. No one was in any particular rush to get going and we technically had the cabin until 11. Dragon head and I finished the pizza for breakfast and we slowly packed up. Around 9:30 he headed out as he needed to go to the outfitter to get new insoles for his feet. Hazel and I headed out short thereafter. The cabin was so nice we didn't want to leave. We had about two miles of flat climbs and then began the climb up Mt Quimby. In the first mile we stopped at Thundering Falls which is the highest waterfall on the AT in Vermont. It was really pretty and was flowing well with all the water from last nights storms. We passed the guy heading southbound who is going for the supported record of the AT. He is running literally. I can't remember his name at this very moment but DH was the one who looked it up. We climbed and I was struggling. This humidity is just kicking my butt big time. The ups are just killer on me and I go super slow. I can't wait for this humidity to break. We descended down Quimby just slightly to views of Pico ski area. Then another up. Jeff texted me that he is mom and brother were going to drive up and meet us at one of the road crossings. We picked stony brook road and I hoped we could slack pack a bit. We began the last climb unnamed and then descended down to stony brook shelter where we rested and ate. We then pushed on to stony brook and waited for Jeff. They showed about 15 minutes later and had chips and mt. dew and sandwiches. We ate and threw our packs in the back and began our packless trek. We did almost 4 miles in one hour and met Jeff at the next road crossing. We snacked some more and said our goodbyes. We had 2.8 miles to the cabin where we were planning on staying. The cabin is a private building but the owners allow hikers to stay at it. The climb up was steep and slow going. Hazel and I took our time and made it to the cabin about 7.

I have since corrected it and 8/11 is right now if you want to the-read it. Woke up this morning at 5:30 to a wonderful sunrise at the cabin. This place was so neat. It is privately owned but the owners allow thru hikers to come and stay in the cabin as long as it's treated with respect. It has a main room with a fireplace and a loft above. There is a ladder which goes to the top of the roof where there is a platform with a bench with 360 views. Simply breathtaking. I hope future hikers take care of this so the land owner continues to allow use. I packed up after having my coffee and breakfast and got on trail at around 6:30. Dragon head and I passed Hazel on our way out as she tented instead of sleeping with the masses in the cabin. We hiked 3 miles to Wintturi shelter where we got water and had more food. The terrain today looked tough but at the end we were getting picked up by Andy who's the husband of a friend I went to college with Chris Files. I went to school in northeastern Vermont, Lyndon State College. It was a great school and I made lots of friends there many I still talk to today. Once we all left the shelter we headed another 3.7 miles to Vermont 12 where there is a place called on the edge farm. There was talk of fresh made pies and we were in. We walked the .20 to the store and bought all kinds of stuff. Hazel and Dragon head bought a whole pie which they proceeded to eat half each. I got an apple turnover and some drinks. Everything tastes fantastic. We continued on and the big ups and downs began. We had 14 ups and 14 downs which just take their toll on you. On up number 5 there was a view which we stopped at to take in and to eat snacks. We continued on up and down reaching cloud land road where there was a cooler with trail magic and water jugs. The cooler had homemade baked goods in it. I had rice crispy treats which had fruity pebbles mixed in with it. Yummy!! We continued on with more ups and downs. I was growing weaker by the minute. I remembered I had a block of Cabot cheese which I bought at the bakery. While waiting for Hazel to catch up I ate the whole block of cheese. Oh boy hopefully that doesn't come back to haunt me later. We finally descended down to Quechee road and then to Vermont 14 where we met Andy. He took us back to the house where we met up with Chris. We were able to do our laundry, shower and had the most wonderful meal of coleslaw, corn on the cob and BBQ chicken all locally grown. It was fantastic.

Today will be the most road walks of the whole trip this far. We came down a road yesterday and got picked up after we crossed a bridge. This morning we continued on the main road for .50 miles and then went right for .50 miles. We crossed under interstate 89 and then the trail went back into the woods. We had two climbs today. The first was up on the road walks to Podunk Road, then the second was up Happy Hill. The climbs were gradual and nothing too steep. The day was cloudy with a bit of mist. We only had 10 miles to go today before we got to Hannover and then we were calling it a day. Hazel's husband was driving from New Brunswick to come see her. They haven't seen each other since April and she was very excited to see him. We stopped at the side trail to Happy Hill Shelter and had a snack and then began the descent. We were dropped out of the woods onto Elm Street in Norwich VT. We had a 1.0 mile road walk and passed many homes. One house had trail magic out front of the house with watermelon, bannana bread, rolls. It was so nice and the person who lived there had converted boots into two planters. It was pretty cool. We continued on elm street and then joined Main Street and had a 1.4 mile road walk. We crossed the bridge over the Connecticut River and crossed into New Hampshire. Hurray, Hurray!! We arrived into Hannover on Main Street and walked past shops, restaurants and a Starbucks. The post office was next store and both Dragon Head and I had packages. My friend Chrissy from Connecticut sent me a bunch of goodies. I ran next store and got and iced macchiato. The store was packed and there was a big line. I got stares and sneers but I had a big smile on my face. Sorry people that I'm ripe and fresh off the trail but you don't I understand the desire for iced coffee. When I came back outside Hazel's husband had arrived and they were hugging. It was so sweet as I fully understand that feeling. We made a quick plan to meet at 9am at Starbucks tomorrow to begin our slack packing.

He takes pictures of every hiker that stays with him and makes a book out of it. This year he has had 83 hikers stay with him so far. He was a great guy and I was so thankful for what he did.

We passed Old Spice and Axe and caught back up to so-free. We stopped at the car with Steven and loaded back up with Mt Dew. Old spice and Axe passed us and then so-free stopped to chat. Hazel told him to throw his pack in the car and slack with us. He did and we continued on our way. Our last climb was up and over Moose Mt which has an elevation of 2254 feet. We had 6 miles to go back to the car and made it in about two hours. So-free continued on and we headed to the campground. We stopped at a store so Hazel could get supplies to make spaghetti. We got to the campground and set up our tents. We camped in the same site as Hazel. The campground had a pool which I took advantage of. We had a wonderful meal together and discussed our plan for tomorrow. The plan is 20 miles up and over smarts and cube Mt. It was early to bed about 8:30 as the plan is to leave at 6:30.,"Hannover NH (Trail Angels Gregs Hose)

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546229,"Woke up today at 5:45. The plan was to leave at 7. Made coffee and had breakfast made by Hazel. She made pancakes and they were delicious. Ever since hiking with Luigi I always carry chocolate chips in my food bag. Hazel made me chocolate chip pancakes. Wohoo. We got in the car and drive the 15 minutes to the trail head. We got on trail at about 7:30 and the first climb we had was up Holts Ledge. In the guide book it talked of a perceptive drop off. We didn't know exactly what that meant and thought it was on the descent. We reached the top and had a fantastic view. The trail followed ledges and there was tall grass and shrubs. If you stepped through the grass and or shrubs it was a perceptive drop off to your death. We now knew why he mentioned it. We descended and came down to the road and met Steven at the car. Steven is Hazel's husband. We loaded up on water, Mt. Dew and snacks. We headed back out with 14 miles remaining. Our next climb was up Smarts mountain which had the typical New Hampshire rock climbs that I knew and love. It's good to be back in New Hampshire. The climb up was steep but the open rock ledges you climb made it interesting. There was a view point that gave you a view of the summit and tower. Ok that's where we need to go. We continued on and reached the summit. We had wood steps and rebar handles. The last mile up the summit was steep, wet rocks and challenges. We stopped at the summit and had snacks. We descended down and stopped at a bridge and a creek. We refilled water and began the climb up Mt Cube. The climbing was very similar to Smarts Mt. Lots of rock ledges and rock hopes. The views from the top were fantastic. We descended down and met Steven. This second day of slacking was amazing. My body is so thankful for it. We got back to Jacobs Brook campground. I showered, made dinner and relaxed. Hit the sack at about 8:30.","Jacob's Brook Campground

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546230,In talking about our third and final slack pack with Steven we decided to do our next stretch southbound vs our normal northbound. I was first like I don't know if I can do that but then said hey I'm still walking the same miles. This way we can start the day with Moosilauke instead of end the day with it. We got on our way and reached the parking area at around 8:30. Steven dropped us off and we began. The climb didn't waste anytime going up. We passed a sign that said only experts should attempt this climb. Please be careful on cascades so there will not be tragic results. The first mile up was steep. We had to use rebar handles and wood block step platforms to get up all the rocks. The trail literally followed a waterfall and cascades up the mountain. We gained 3000 feet in 1.5 miles. It felt so good to be climbing this steep up without a big pack. In what seemed like no time we reached the top. The first mile super steep and then the next two miles were climbs but not too bad. The last several 100 feet or so was above treeline and the view was simply fantastic. The wind was howling and it was cool. We took pictures and began our descent. Hazel and I took the side trail to the south peak and took pictures. We then headed down the 5 mile descent. We crossed over a few roads and met Steven in the parking lot. While in the parking lot we saw the hiker yearbook bus and Odie came over to us to make sure he has got our pictures. I can't wait to buy the yearbook. We continued on after saying goodbye to Odie and Steven and tackled Mist Mt which was our last big climb of the day. After we reached the summit of Mist Mt we had a gradual descent all the way to the car. We passed the 400 mile point which means we have under 400 miles left to walk. It was pretty exciting to pass that point. Tomorrow when we get back to the parking lot and cross the road we will have hit the 1800 mile mark. We popped out of the woods at 6:15 and met Steven. We headed back to campground for shower. Then off to the laundromat and dinner. We topped off the day with ice cream and I ordered coffee flavored soft serve. A first for me. Tomorrow we head into the Mt Kinsman area.,"Jacobs Creek Campground.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546346,"I woke up at around 7 am in my tent. The plan today was to pack up and meet Trooper and Chris Lovell at the parking area at the trailhead. Doug and his mom were coming to the campground to meet up and help Stephen lighten the load from the 3 of us and our packs and all of their camping stuff. Doug arrived and Hazel broke down and said she's not ready to say goodbye to Stephen yet. My heart broke as I knew exactly how she felt when I had to say goodbye to Jeff that first time in Marion. So Doug brought Dragon Head, Ninja and I to the parking area. We arrived at 9 and Trooper and Chris were already there. OMG I was so excited to see the two of them. I hadn't seen Chris since December. They were setting up and had doughnuts, soda, Gatorade, fruit, chips, lunch meats and rolls. Dragon Head and Ninja met everyone and they soon started off. I stayed until 10 and didn't want to get on trail. I wanted to stay all day with them. Doug was slack packing us and I needed to head out before Ninja and DH got too far ahead. Trooper and Chris did trail magic until 3 and had many hikers. Chris loved doing it and got a better understanding of the trail. I started up the climb from the road and the terrain was tough. There were about 10 ups and down passing Dilly Cliffs and then I climbed up and over Mt Wolf at 3478 feet. The trail was muddy, wet and slippery. At one point I stepped on a board and went to step again and it wasn't wood but a leave. My foot sunk up to my knee in the mud and I thought I was going over my head. I was covered in mud on one leg. The trail then descended down to Eliza Brook Shelter which was open bare wet rocks which ended up being a super long slip and slide. I stopped at the shelter to have lunch and Dragon Head and Ninja were there so I caught up. After lunch we began the climb up South Kinsman which was straight up and rock climbs hand over fist. We reached the summit to blue skies and a stiff wind. The views were fantastic and a panorama view. We had a short saddle walk to North Kinsman and not a very good view. We then had a very steep decent down to lonesome lake hut. Lonesome Lake had fantastic views of the Franconia Ridge. We carried on and made our way down to route 3. We passed under both bridges and left the trail to climb up to the road. After a bit of confusion to where Doug was we found the car and brought Dragon Head and Ninja to their motel in North Woodstock. We then headed to Whitefield to the only motel room available in all of the White Mountains. I was exhausted after doing 16 miles and that was without a pack. I would have had to broken that into two days with a pack. We had dinner in Lancaster and I had a fantastic steak and cheese. Then we headed back to the motel where I immediately passed out.","Jacobs Creek Campground

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546415,"Woke up at Barron Brook Inn. Doug and I shared a room and Jeff's mom had her own. The reservation got screwed up online so they had to get a room at a different motel but got a free room out of it. I got up and grabbed a cup of coffee before jumping in the shower. Then packed my bag and went through my food bag to ensure I had enough food to make it to Crawford Notch. I was thinking our little trail family got scattered to the crosswinds. Hazel was behind as she couldn't say goodbye to Stephen just yet and didn't get onto the trail until around 12:30. Ninja and Dragon Head had made a reservation at a motel in Woodstock but I didn't jump in with them on it as I wasn't sure what family was going to do. Good thing as with us slack packing we didn't make it to the road on route 3 until about 7. We dropped Ninja and Dragon Head off at the motel and had to drive to Whitfield to the only motel with a room available. So all of us started at different locations and times today. We checked out of the motel and headed on route 2 towards Lyndonville, Vermont to meet my old college roommate for breakfast. We went to the Miss Lyndonville diner for breakfast and it was fantastic. Heather, Meghan and Andy met up with us and we had a good time catching up. We left about 11 and headed down I-91 to I-93 back to Franconia Notch. I got dropped off on the side of the highway and said goodbye to Doug and mom and started back into the woods. The first part of the day was a steady almost steep climb up Liberty Springs trail for 2.9 miles. Then I merged onto the Franconia Ridge trail which went up and over Haystack, Lincoln and Lafayette peaks. Once you summit Haystack you are above treeline and the views were amazing. The visibility was clear and the scenery beautiful. The climbs up each peak were only a few hundred feet and each peak you gradually gain more elevation. Once on top of Lafayette I noticed that the clouds were moving in. I knew the rain was coming and wanted to boogie to make it to Garfield Shelter before the rain hit. Dragon head had said he was going to try and make it there today. I descended down Lafayette and the wind began to howl and really blew me around. I looked at radar and saw the rain close. I was running out of time and got to Garfield Pond and saw some stealth campsites and quickly set up my tent. I had enough time to eat, brush my teeth and put up my food bag before the storm hit. I'm snuggled in my tent in my bag as the wind howls and the rain falls.","Barron Brook Inn

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546733,"What a wet and wild night. The storm really started to ramp up around 9pm and lasted most of the night. It poured and poured. Luckily I stayed dry except for some mist that blew into the tent. The temperature plummeted and hovered somewhere around 45. I was snuggled in my sleeping and was content. I woke up to a baby crying. Wait is that really a baby crying or is it a child crying. I unzipped my rain fly and stuck my head out into the fog to see and didn't see anything. I went back to bed and heard it again. This time I got up the use the ""gentleman's lounge and saw a girl mid 20's sitting on a log but didn't hear crying. Hmm. I began packing up and started on my way but passed the girl and a guy. I asked them if they were ok and found out that their tent poles were left at the last place they camped so they had to sleep out in the rain. They looked pretty miserable and she was crying from being so cold. I suggested they get moving to warm up and not sit too long in one place. They were packing up when I left and I began my ascent of Mt. Garfield. With all the rain last light the trail was a creek. Lots of water running down the trail. It was in the mid 40's and winds gusting to 50-60 mph. I reached the summit of Garfield in pea soup fog and high winds. Didn't stay too long and then I began my descent down Garfield stopping at Garfield Shelter to make some chicken noodle soup. I relaxed and stayed for about a half hour and then pushed on. I filled up my water at the creek at the junction of the trail and the side trail to the shelter. I saw the couple who slept out in the rain coming down from the summit of Garfield and they were moving. They didn't look happy but at least no longer looking like hypothermia. I pushed on and continued my descent down. The trail looked like it crossed over the creek but then there was no path. I looked down the creek and there were the white blazes which went straight down. You got to be kidding me. I think normally without the heavy rain the creek stays under all the boulders. Today however it was pouring into my boots on top of my head as I weaved my way down holding onto trees, roots and anything I could to avoid slipping. I was pretty wet. The trail leveled out with only small ups and downs. I was getting pretty cold and arrived at Galehead Hut. I went inside to warm up and met Pharmacist and Sneaky Pete. They were having soup and coffee and I joined them. I joined them and we talked about our plans for the day. It was raw and even chilly in the hut. They were calling for wind gusts up to 85mph on the peaks today. Pharmacist was talking about staying at the hut and seeing about getting work for stay. Sneaky Pete and I were going to move to Zealand Notch Hut. I packed up and headed out at around 2 to try to get to the hut for 5. I began my ascent up South Twin Mt. It was straight up at a steep pitch for a mile. When I reached the top the wind was so strong I could barely stand up. It kept blowing me over. I began the descent down and Sneaky Pete caught up to me. We started hiking together the rest of the way to the hut. We went up and over Guyot Mt and Zealand Mt. We came to Zeacliff and had a fantastic view of the notch and valley below. When we arrived to Zeacliff the sun came out and the skies cleared. Finally!! We made the final ascent and arrived at the hut. Sneaky Pete is a fast hiker and I had fun trying to keep up with him. We asked at the hut if they had any work for stay left. Sneaky Pete was more interested in work for food more than staying over night. They told us they could use one of us and he told me to take it. They were getting ready for dinner and asked us to wait outside. Sneaky Pete and I sat on the benches in front of the hut taking in the views. Two south bounders who were on the other side of the hut came over and said hi. They were doing work for stay as well. One of the hut workers brought out leftovers for sneaky Pete who was gonna be moving on tonight. After he ate he headed out to find a stealth campsite down the trail. At 7:45 they invited us in for left overs. They cooked us some bow ties with sauce as there were not a ton of leftovers. There was salad, rice, fresh bread, pasta, corn chowder and chocolate chip cookies. Yum!! After dinner the two south bounders had some work to do but my work wouldn't be until the morning as I was in no rush to go anywhere. I kinda felt under the weather and was trying to relax and enjoy myself. I read for awhile while the two south bounders cleaned the stove. At 9:30 they shut the hut lights off and I went out to look at the stars briefly. We pushed some of the tables over and made room for us to roll out our mats and sleeping bags to sleep on the dinning room floor. I zonked out almost immediately.","Garfield Pond Stealth site

I packed up and brought my stuff out on the deck and sat and had a cup of coffee. Jeff had said possibly he would drive up and come find me in Crawford Notch but unfortunately I hadn't cell service to text him anything. The guests finished their breakfast around 8:30 and the Croo had me come in for leftovers. Corn bread, oatmeal, dried apricots, and sliced peaches. Delicious!! I sat and wrote my trail journals for the next day while drinking more coffee. I finished and the dining room cleared out so I asked what they needed me to do for my work for stay. They asked if I could sweep out both bunk rooms and the dining room floor. No problem that's a piece of cake I got this. It only took me about 40 minutes to sweep all three spaces. Once I was done I decided to leave my pack and hike up to Zeacliff to see if I could get a text out to Jeff. I didn't want him driving up to meet me when I was no where near Crawford Notch. Luckily I had enough cell service to get the text out no problem. I was hoping with my delay this morning Hazel would catch up to me. I told myself to be on trail by noon at the latest. When I got back to Zealand Hut I got my gear on and headed out. I had a small climb down from the hut to the side trail that leads you to the road that most people walk into the hut from. I continued on into the notch and was amazed at the beauty and the fact that the trail was flat for 6 miles. The trail wanders between Zealand Notch and then passes Ethan pond before descending down into Crawford Notch. I stopped at Ethan Pond to have a snack and to check out the view. I continued on and descended down to the road where I walked a mile up the road to the Wiley House to get food. I had a turkey sandwich, bag of chips, 2 cokes and a Powerade. I had been battling a stomach ache most of the day and I suspect it was from the curry sauce I had at Zealand Notch. I was hoping that this food would help alleviate that problem. Well unfortunately the stomach ache continued while I made the big climb up Mt. Webster. My plan was to get to the Webster Cliffs and to stealth camp. The climb up was steep but I took it slow and arrived at the Webster Cliffs. I found a great place to camp and set up. I made dinner and watched the sunset.

Finally roadrunner said he had seen Hazel at Ethan Pond last night and her plan was to hitch to the campground and take a shower and do laundry. Yes I know where she is now good. I packed up and headed north. Climbing steeply up to the summit of Webster Mt I had fantastic 360 views. No clouds in the sky and Mt Washington was fully visible all day. There was a small descent after Webster and then a steep climb up Mt. Jackson where the views got even better. A nice family on the summit gave me an apple and string cheese which I was so thankful for. They were gone within seconds. I continued on and stopped at Mizpah Spring Hut where I had a bowl of soup and some lemonade. I met up with Smeigal there who was the girl who I did the half gallon challenge with. We hiked the rest of the way climbing up out of Mizpah Hut, over Mt Pierce, past Eisenhower, over Mt Franklin, and the past Monroe to Lake of the clouds hut. The hut was very busy and we checked in to see if there was any work for stay available. I was one of the last two to get work for stay and they asked if I minded hanging back in the morning to clean up after breakfast. While they set up for diner and the guests ate the 10 of us sat outside and watched the sunset. It started to get cold out so we sat inside while the guests finished up. Once the Croo ate them we were allowed to get dinner. There was not a lot of left overs so the chef made us a big pot of pasta and we used the BBQ sauce from the pulled pork for sauce. It was fantastic. There was salad and chocolate chip cookies. I was content and at 9:30 they shut the house lights down after the other thru hikers did their work for stay. I went outside to watch the stars for 30 minutes as the visibility was fantastic. I crashed really quickly and was thankful to be inside as it was rather cold outside.

I made a cup of coffee and sat outside and watched the sunrise. Breakfast finished up and they invited me and roadrunner in for some breakfast. There were left over eggs I was so excited. We also had pineapple, coffee cake, and oatmeal and brown sugar for breakfast. After we finished eating, our work for stay was to sweep the dinning room and the bunk rooms. It took no time at all as with all my years of restaurant experience this was a piece of cake. Once the chores were done I wrote up my journal and called the family. While on the phone I saw Hazel coming down the hill to Lake of The Clouds. Finally reunited at last. We went inside for a bit and Hazel got some coffee cake. We headed out after she ate to begin out 1.3 mile climb up to the summit of Mt Washington. We got to the top and there was a line to take your picture with the sign that read Mt Washington summit. We decided to say forget it and took our picture with the sign in the background. We went into the visitor center at the top to get some food. I had 2 hotdogs and nachos. They provide an area for hikers to put their backpacks so we dropped off our packs and charged our phones. We continued on and descended down Mt Washington around the the Great Gulf. We passed Adams and headed towards Mt Madison stopping at Madison Hut. I went in to ask if they had any work for stay. They told me it was too early and that they like to reserve work for stay to hikers that get there late between 7-8. Hazel and I then decided to take the .60 side trail down to a campsite. The only other option was to hike 4 miles over to Osgood campsite. The hike down the side trail was steep and we lost a lot of elevation. Argh!!

We began the climb up Madison and the rain and wind started. It was slow going as we were climbing over slippery wet boulders. I started singing reunited and it feels so good. Hazel started to laugh. It's nice to be back together. We summited Madison and started the descent. It took us about 3 hours to get below tree line as the rocks made it slow going. We stopped for a few snacks. The trail at this point enters the Great Gulf Wilderness and has no white blazes. You need to really pay attention to trail names and know where the AT goes. I stopped at a creek crossing at washed off and poured cold water on my head. Hazel changed into shorts as I got sunny and warmer than it was above tree line. We started again and I crossed the creek and was on the other side and slipped on a rock and down I went. I crunched and the sound my body made as I hit the ground was terrible. Hazel thought that's it his hike is over. Luckily nothing broken and not cuts. Just a bit sore. We carried on and the soreness lessened. We had one small climb up and over the shoulder that the Mt Washington Road sits on. We crossed over the auto road and descended down into Pinkham Notch. We immediately went to the cafeteria and got food. While I was eating Sleeping Bear showed up who I haven't seen since Boiling Springs, PA when him Cake and I went to the pool. I was very happy to see him again. I went down and took a shower and got clean clothes on. Hazel called Stephen to let him know how she was doing. My sister was on her way up from Massachusetts to pick Hazel and I up and bring us to my grandmothers house to take a day off to rest. She arrived at 5 and we headed into Gorham to do laundry. We went to Chinese food buffet while the clothes were washing. We switched over to the dryer and headed to Walmart to pick up food for Saturday. While walking into Walmart we saw Dragon Head and Ninja. They were taking a zero after doing a brutal 21 mile slack pack from Pinkham Notch to route 2 near Gorham. Ninja had slipped and fallen and went down into a crevice that Dragon Head had to pull her out of. She was all bruised but thankfully ok. Hazel and I had debated doing the slack pack but now said no way. They headed back to the hostel. We shopped and bought lots of food for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

When we got back we ate lunch and made sandwiches of turkey, ham and cheese, pickles, chips. We stuffed ourselves and then took a walk out back to the river. The water level was low enough that we could walk across to the sandy beach on the other side which we used to do as kids. We spent about 40 minutes down by the water and headed back up to the house to relax. We then decided to go up to Christine Lake and go for a swim. The water was warm but the wind made it cold. We swam for about 30 minutes before it got too cold to stand. On the way back to the house we drove by crystal falls to check them out.

I got up and went downstairs. Hazel was already downstairs having some watermelon. I had a huge bowl of watermelon and brewed a pot of coffee. My sister and gram got up shortly thereafter and we ate an assortment of breakfast. We sort of ate all the left overs. My sister made us sandwiches and we packed up and got on our way. Saying goodbye to my gram was hard as I don't get to see her as much as I would like to. We headed to Walmart to resupply. Looking ahead as we go into Maine resupply is going to get harder and harder. Towns are 8-12 miles from the trail head. We will manage but for now we are doing a resupply for 6 days. We packed our packs with only 2 days worth of food and dropped off the rest at White Mountain Hostel where we will be staying Monday night. Hazel had a great idea with that. She gets big points. My sister drove us to Pinkham Notch Visitor center and dropped us off. We said our goodbyes and she took two hikers into Gorham on her way home. My sister is the best to have driven all the way up here from Massachusetts to pick us up and stay one day at grams to drop us back off and drive all the way back. My body greatly appreciates it. Hazel and I crossed route 16 and took lost pond trail for .50 miles to lost pond. We then took the wildcat ridge trail which began a super steep climb up wildcat. It was basically a cliff climb for the first two miles. The trail was steep with rock boulders to climbing up rock slabs to almost vertical rocks with hand holds. We made it to the top of the first Wildcat Peak. Phew!!! We sat and ate our first sandwich that my sister made. While eating Mosey walked by and stopped to say hi. I briefly met him in Hanover New Hampshire while we waited in line together at the post office. We continued on to the second wildcat peak with the climbs not nearly as steep as the first. This summit was where the wildcat gondola comes up from the ski area. We rested for a bit and took in the scenery. We then continued on to the last two peaks. These last two were gradual ups and downs. We finally had a view of Carter notch and Carter Dome as well as the Carter Hut at the bottom of notch. We descended down wildcat and made it down to Carter Hut where we ate our second sandwich and filled up on water. We rested and began the steep climb up out of the notch to the top of Carter Dome. This climb was not as bad as the first climb up wildcat but it was straight up stepping up onto rock after rock. It was like climbing a big staircase. I checked the radar on my phone as I finally got service again and it showed thunderstorms and rain coming. It looked like we had an hour until the rain. We kept moving and made it to the top of Carter dome. We didn't see any stealth campsites along the way and had a gradual descent and then an ascent. While we climbed up Mt Hight gradually we saw a tent in what looked like a good spot. It was Mosey who had set up and he said to join him. Hazel and I were happy as we heard thunder coming and didn't want to get wet. We quickly set up our tent and did out chores before the rain came. Luckily the bad storms went just to our north.

We camped with Mosey last night which is funny as that is what Trooper calls me sometimes. We got up and had breakfast and made coffee. We got packed up and headed out by 7:30. We had about 50 feet to go before the summit of Mt Hight. The view was really neat as a dark cloud was sitting on top of the mountain but every direction you look you could see sun on the other mountsins. We descended down to Zeta pass and passed two people tenting. We climbed up and over Middle Carter and north Carter which wasn't too bad. However the descent from north Carter down to the Imp Campsite was another thing. This was the hardest descent for me on the whole trail. The combination of mossy wet rocks, followed by wind and bad footing made for a difficult descent. Hazel went first and we both were like what the heck are we doing. We laughed a lot mostly at the absurdity of the trail layout. If there were two ways to go down a particular rock we said ok we have a 50% chance of death. It took us two hours to go 1 mile. We made it down and cheered. We kept saying ""precipitous drop off"" anyone? We were close to the Imp Campsite when Mosey and so-free passed us. We hadn't seen so-free since the day we hiked out of Hannover and he slack packed with us for several miles. When we arrived to the shelter it was a side trail .20 miles straight down so we said forget it we will just sit on the trail rest, and have a snack. After our snack we had one more climb up Mt. Moriah which was a gradual climb up many open rock faces. We were gainin elevation but it did not feel like it. The weather had been weird all day. Dark cloud sitting overhead became fog with mist. Then it lifted to be broken clouds and sun with high winds. We heard from a hiker that a large group of Thru hikers were stuck at lake of the clouds as the winds on Mt Washington were gusting to 100 and they decided to wait for better weather. We reached the summit of Mt Moriah and began the descent down. The guidebook said it was a gently sloping trail to route 2 but the steep trail said otherwise. We later learned the gently sloping portion did not start until the shelter. We took our time down and reached route 2. Which meant 2 things. We went under the 300 mile mark for miles left to go and we are officially done with the Whites. Hazel and I walked the .10 miles up the road walk of the AT to the hostel and checked in. We got our laundry ready to wash, took a shower and hopped on the shuttle to Walmart to pick up the few supplies we needed and to get dinner. We went back to the hostel and ate. I went outside and sat by the fire and relaxed. We have an all you can eat breakfast tomorrow morning. Wohoo!!","Mt Hight stealth spot.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547450,"Woke up at White Mountain House Hostel at 3am and was like what the heck. I streamed law and order on my phone last night via the wireless and got sucked in. They just released the next season I was waiting to watch on Netflix. I went back to sleep and woke up at 6:45 and went downstairs and sat in the living room. Breakfast will be served at 7am and is part of the price of staying there. They had French toast, sausage, hash browns, coffee and orange juice. It was delicious and filling. We got packed up and on trail at about 8:30. We had about a half mile of road walks before we began the ascent up Mt. Hayes. The climb was not like in the Whites. It was up but at a much more manageable pace. We arrived on the rocky summit and rested in the warm sun. Several other hikers were there including Paisley. She is a section hiker finishing up the trail after injuring herself in 2014 she had to get off the trail on New York. We met her in the Whites and she has been in the same day bubble as us for the last week or so. We carried on dropping down a few hundred feet before climbing up Cascade Mountain, which had lots of ledges which gave great views back to the Whites. We had a steep climb down to Trident Campsite where we filled up on water and continued on. We passed by Page Pond on our way climbing up to Wocket Ledge. I will have to admit there was a cocky thru hiker in his 20's today that seemed to try and catch me and pass me climbing up to Wocket Ledge. I heard him speed up so I did. He was huffing and puffing but couldn't pass me. I got to the top and he came at bit later and looked like he was about to pass out. I won!! He was coughing and choking. I said to myself yup keep smoking those cigarettes. I felt great yay me. Insert little devil on shoulder. I rested and waited for Hazel has I took off running up the mountain. She wasn't very far behind and we stopped to have some snacks. We continued on dropping down and had one more climb up before dropping down to dream lake. This is where we hit the 1900 mile mark. I can't believe it we have walked 1900 miles. Paisley caught up to us and we hiked the rest of the way to Gentian Pond where Hazel and I took the double tent platform and Paisley set up her hammock nearby. We made dinner and I was ready for bed by 7:50.","White Mountain Hostel.

I woke up to that sound of rain at 5:30 and fell back asleep. Finally at 7 when I sat up it was still raining. Hazel and I made breakfast from our tents and I made hot coffee. I packed up everything I could and brought my bag down to the shelter. I headed back to the tent and the rain let up enough to let us collapse and pack up. We got on trail a bit before 8. The first climb of the day was Mt. Success which was a series of ups and downs getting you higher and higher. Lots of mud and lots of wet rocks. Made for a slow go of it. The top of Mt Success offered some views but with the clouds not as spectacular of a view. We climbed down Mt success which was steep and slippery. Slow slow slow. Once at the bottom we had several more ups and downs. Several of the downs were steep slabs of rocks with drop offs on either side. I was pretty terrified a few times due to the wet rocks. A slip could be fatal or really in bad shape. Hazel and I laughed because what else is there to do with the situation. This is a good tree, this is a good root, we would yell to one another. We would occasionally yell not a good root not a good root. A southbounder listened to us for 20 minutes coming down a particularly tricky section and laughed that we were gonna start taking up pot to calm our nerves. We made it to the shelter and saw it was .30 miles and said nah we will have our snack right here. We carried on and had to climb full goose mountain and its three peaks. We started up and had many wet rock slabs to make our way up then we got to the rebar ladder and Hazel said oh boy. I took a video of her climbing up as it was a perfect example of what we do out here. We made it to the summit of Goose eye mountain west peak and rested. We proceeded on going down and up both Goose eye east peak and north peak. We then had a very steep climb down which was slow going. We had several ladders of rebar to climb down. For being under 10 miles of walking this literally took all day. We arrived at the campsite and we're lucky enough to grab one of the three tent platforms. The double had already been taken and Hazel and I finagled a way to get both of our tents on the platform. We used a log to tie one side of my rain fly to so my tent would not flood in the rain. We made dinner and relaxed before the rain headed in. Tomorrow we do Mahosec Notch and the arm. What fun.","Gentian Pond Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547652,"This is what Hazel said as she stared into her hot chocolate this morning. ""What horrors await us today"" I couldn't help but laugh. I woke up around 6:30 to only a little bit of water in my tent. I was worried where we didn't have our rain flies pulled tight that we would leak. It was a foggy morning and cool and neither of us wanted to move. Yesterday was a really hard day and we only went a little under ten miles. You never know how hard the terrain is going to be by looking at the elevation profile. We made breakfast at our tents and talked about the plan for the day. Hazel said oh I wonder what horrors await us today. I laughed as Mahosec Notch is coming and just like yesterday it looks like we will be dealing with wet rocks. The shelter area was packed. I would guess there was 40 people crammed in everywhere. The shelter was full, all the tent pads were full and people were camped wherever they could fit. Yesterday people zeroed at the shelter as they didn't want to do the notch in the rain. Then all the people from the shelter we stayed at including us came, a few southbounders, and finally a few backpackers made for a full site. Hazel and I finally got packed up and on the trail by 8am. We were one of the first people to leave and I think everyone was waiting for drier weather. Our first climb of the day was Fulling Mill Mountain. The climb was not to bad but the descent down to the notch was steep and with wet rocks very difficult. We reached the beginning of the notch and started in. The notch itself is only a mile long and it took us 3 hours to traverse through. We had to climb, hop, crawl under, fling ourselves from rocks, under rocks. Then you add in wet rocks and it makes for an interesting time. The rocks in the notch had fallen from the cliffs above which created a jumble of them. You would climb over one rock to have a drop off on the other side, you would have to hold on to the Rock and slide your body off trying to get s foothold on another rock. Some moments were scary as if you slipped you would be really hurt. We finally made it through the notched a bit scratched, bruised and sore but everything still attached. After the notch we had a climb up Mahoosuc Arm. When we got to the summit we texted Emily (Prime and Grey). They are hikers Hazel met on the trail in the south. The flipped from Harper's Ferry to Katahdin and started hiking south. They had kept in contact via email and were taking a week off to explore Maine and New Hampshire. They wanted to take us out to dinner. We were soooo excited. We agreed to text when we were descending. We descended down to Speck Pond and then began to climb up Old Speck Mt. Hazel had a slip on the rock face and banged her knee, elbow, ribs and hip pretty good. I was a bit ahead but crash and red came to her rescue and took her pack so she could get up that stretch easier. She is ok but sore and a bit bloody. We made it to the summit and had a fantastic view of the valley below. We texted Emily and began our descent down. 3.5 miles and it was loooooooong descent. The trail was nice and not too steep which made for a long way down. We arrived close to 7 and Prime and grey were waiting for us. They brought us Gatorade which we were so thankful for. We got into the car and headed to dinner. I was so grateful for their generosity and they told us about the trail ahead. They mentioned there will be a rope. Yes a rope to go over the edge. Dinner was great. I had steak and cheese sandwich, Hazel got pulled pork. We had a great time and they stopped at a gas station on the way back for us to get some snacks. We got back to Grafton Notch and set up our tents by some picnic tables on the path to the privy. It was gonna be a cold night. I looked at my watch as I was laying down and it was 10:56. 10:56!!!!!

I woke up and got up around 7:30 to a cloudy day. There were some day hikers who had slept in their car having breakfast at the picnic table as well as another 4 thru hikers who were also camped there. Hazel and I joined in for breakfast at the picnic tables and talked about the plan for the day. We decided it would be good to try and get into the hostel in Andover to shower and so Hazel could clean up her cut. We started off about 8:30 and began the climb up Baldplate Mt. It was three miles up and the trail was nice. The last mile was steep and had lots of stone steps. We rested on the west peak and I called the hostel and made a reservation. We descended and then ascended Baldpate east peak. This peak was a treeless soil less dome. We rock scrambled up to the summit and it was a bit hairy at times but we made do. We descended down to Frye Notch lean-to and ate lunch. We had a small ascent and called the hostel to arrange a shuttle to get into town. The descent down was an easy 4 miles. We arrived at East Hill road with ten minutes to spare. The shuttle guy was called Sherlock who thru hiked in 2002. We got to the hostel and checked in, took showers and headed to the red hen diner for prime rib special. It was delicious and we wolfed it down in no time.

Hazel was already up and inside the main house having hot chocolate. I joined her with a cup of coffee. We headed into town for breakfast at the red hen then went to the general store for some short term resupply. This town was crazy expensive on resupply items. We bought the bare minimum as we didn't want to spend a fortune. We headed back to the house and packed up and waited for the 10am shuttle. We were back on trail the first climb of the day was a long but easy ascent up Wyman Mt. Half way up we passed surplus pond which was really pretty. We stopped at Hall Mt. lean-to which was on the summit of our next climb. We descended steeply down to sawyer notch and then immediately began the climb up Moody Mt which was an unforgiving trail. Straight up for .90 miles and 1600 feet in elevation gain. We rested on the top at a view point and climbed down the other side with the trail being gradual to the bottom. We found a really nice camp spot by the river and set up. There was even a new privy close by with a porch. While setting up Hazel was getting bite by little black insects and then I started to. We got out gear inside our tents and realized they were fleas. They were all over our netting and some were managing to get in our tent. Aaaaaahhhhh. We decided to abort the campsite and Hazel ran over to another area to see if they were over there. No fleas but this spot had a huge wasps nest and lots of wasps flying around. We broke down the tents while being attacked by fleas and headed across the road hoping something would be on the other side. The other side of the road immediately went steeply up and nowhere to camp. I walked down the road a little bit and saw a campsite in the woods that is not supposed to be used but at this point we didn't have a choice. We set up in the dark and made dinner.

I played the soundtrack of Wicked for Hazel who had never heard it. The music gave us a nice break to the hike and we were on the summit in no time. We stopped for a snack and the view was wonderful. We followed the trail along the ridge line and summitted Bemis Mt and Bemis second peak. The trail was really nice today. We hiked with and leapfrogged old timer, red, crash and nacho. We descended down to a dirt road and camped near Bemis stream. The weather today was just perfect for hiking. Hazel bumped her knee again and tore off the scab. We need to wrap it with heavy layering to keep it safe. We made dinner, hung the bear bag and I think by 7:45 I was drifting off to sleep. Dragon head and Ninja are about 61 miles ahead of us.

We continued on the hill after crossing the street and the trail leveled out. The rest of the day would be gradual ups and gradual downs. We stopped at the sabbath day shelter and had a snack. I had called farmhouse inn yesterday to say we would be coming in. Kirk had told me when I got to Rangeley he would pay for my stay at the inn. They told me before I descended the hill to call them to set up a pick up from the trailhead. We moved on from the shelter making great time and stopped for lunch at a campsite on a pond. It was such a nice scenic spot. We were able to fill up on water and carried on. I called the inn to let them know that we would be there at 3 to the trailhead. The girl at the inn said everyone was doing runs and that she would try and get us a ride but if no one was there by 3:30 to try and hitch. We continued on our way with a slow decent to the road.

It was sunny and the terrain was steep but nothing we aren't used to. We stopped at Eddy Pond to have lunch and it was such a beautiful spot. Old Timer stopped and had a snack at the pond as well. We continued on and began the steep climb up Saddleback. The clouds and fogged moved on when we got close to the summit as well as the mist. Descending down the other side was tricky with the wet rocks. We went slow and began the climb up the horn. This wasn't too bad as we only descended a few 100 feet down from saddleback. On the summit of the horn the sun came out. We descended down the horn and stopped at a campsite at the bottom to fill up on water and to have a snack.

It feels like everyday I'm getting weaker and weaker even though I'm eating and eating.

He flip flopped from Harper's Ferry and said that he's at the peak of his hike and in shape. We are at the end of our hike and our bodies are in the decline stage so big miles are just not possible. It's taking everything I got to get up the climbs and the energy level is really low. It makes sense as after 2000 miles I'm pretty tired. We headed out on trail at around 7:30 and began the steepest 1/2 mile climb on the whole AT supposedly. It wasn't too bad and we summited Avery peak. At the top we met Otter who was a flip flipper. I had heard there was another Otter on the trail, not to be confused with my Otter from Hot Springs. We continued in our way going up and over the horn and little Bigelow. We then had a three mile descent down to the road where we were going to meet Stephen. We got to the road and there was trail magic given by past thru hikers. It was such a nice thing to come out to. Stephen was not there yet and we had hamburgers, pasta salad, doughnuts, cake, soda, iced tea, ice cream sandwiches. It was simply amazing. We met the guy who created the Guthook app for Thru hikers. He was part of the group doing trail magic. After about two hours and Stephen wasn't there we began to worry. I tried calling him up on the hill and got nothing. I even had home try and call him. We sat for another hour and finally he pulled up. The guidebook coordinates for the parking area sent him to a completely different parking area where he sat for four hours.

It poured and poured and we got soaked as well as the trail turned into a river. We made it to pierce pond shelter at noon. This gave us 3.6 miles to the river. The last ferry leaves at 2 and we didn't want to miss it as it would really foil our plans. We boogied on and the rain subsided and the sun even tried to come out. We made it to the landing for the river crossing at 1:45. There were two other hikers in front of us who were being ferried across the river so we waited.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548746,"Day 1 of the 100 mile wilderness: I had a hard time sleeping last night. I think I was nervous going into the 100 mile wilderness with all the food. The weight was my biggest concern on my feet. There were options like a food drop for 80 dollars but I made it through the Smokies why not this. The other thing starting to get me is this is almost over. The hardest part is going to be the people aspect. Hikers I've hiked with many miles ago are either ahead or behind me. Dragon Head for instance will be summiting on Friday as he is about 5 days ahead. Other familiar faces who you may not have hiked with but have been at shelters or passed you back and forth since Virginia are now summiting. When a familiar passes you think is this the last time I'll see them. Cheeks and Old Timer just got into the shuttle to be dropped off and Hazel said that may be the last time we see those two. It's weird how these people out here become your family. On the AT if you have the guts and the determination to be out here there is a respect among hikers. We have lived it and know what you've just faced. It's gonna be hard to say goodbye. Cake and Haiku were at the hostel last night and are taking a zero today. Hazel and I are just about ready to head out so I just said goodbye to cake and haiku on the off chance we don't see them in the 100 mile. They should catch up but you just don't know at this point. Maybe it will be easier to say you'll catch up and not say goodbye. As for updates to names you all know, Luigi and her crew have come into New Hampshire and should just be about to come into the Whites. The royal couple are about 3 days behind me and should be neat Stratton, ME. Dragon head and ninja geisha will summit on Friday. I will start posting summit pictures of those you have heard about on this journey. For now back to the day. After not sleeping much I jumped into the shower and we headed down to breakfast. It was wonderful with eggs made the way you like them, bacon, OJ, hash browns, and all you can eat blueberry pancakes. Fantastic. After breakfast we packed our bags and the food didn't fit quite all in the food bag. My pack is so heavy the first two days in the hundred miles are gonna be awful on the weight. We got picked up by the family who came up to bring me new boots and some other items and to take home some other items. We slack packed 3.5 miles from the first Monson exit to the second. Then we loaded everything up and said goodbye and headed into the woods. Heave heavy heavy packs ugh. There was a sign warning do not enter u less you have enough supplies for ten days. We began walking and ten minutes in it began to rain. Yay welcome to the 100 mile wilderness lets start you off wet. We stopped at a pond to have a snack and rest. I think the first two days will be lots of little breaks. We chugged on and the trail had a lot of little ups and downs. Nothing too hard but heavy packs and wet roots and rocks made it a bit tough. We stopped at Leeman Brook lean-to for break #2 and rested for a bit. We pushed on and went another 5 miles and stopped at little Wilson stream for camp. Someone had made a sofa out of rocks and it was quite handy. We slept with our food as it all didn't fit in our food bags so why hang some while sleeping with the rest. I passed out about 8:30.","Shaw's hostel

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548896,"Day 2 of the 100 mile wilderness. I woke up dreaming about blueberry muffins and hearing trooper saying they were the worst tasting blueberry muffins ever. Ok!?! of all food items to dream about blueberry muffins, really!! I fell back asleep and woke up to Hazel saying ""good morning storm"". Coffee and hot cocoa were had. This is my new favorite thing. Mix the two together. Ate a few pumpkin pie pop tarts and we packed up. We hit the trail at 7:30 and had more small ups and downs. We had to ford the Big Wilson stream which was mid thigh and had a current. It was a little intense but fun. We had to take our boots and soaks off and wear our camp shoes. We climbed up another hill and crossed railroad tracks before reaching Wilson Valley lean-to where we had a late morning snack. We continued on crossing several brooks and streams. We forded long pond stream before getting to Long Pond Stream shelter for lunch. We rested and ate for about 30 minutes and then began the climb up Barren Mt. We reached Barren slide and Barren ledges and had a spectacular view. It's probably one of my favorites on the whole trail. We continued on climbing up to the remnants of a fire tower with more spectacular views. We had a slight down and continued on to the side trail to the shelter. It was .40 off trail ugh!!! We needed to get water so we had to go. The terrain today was super tough. We only managed to go 12.3 and it took all day. It was pretty defeating as we don't have food for ten days. We walked the .40 to the shelter and came upon the most beautiful campsite ever. It was on a small bluff overlooking cloud pond. It was magical and one of my favorite tenting spots to date. We talked about the list of lasts. The last resupply, the last hostel. Ugh it's so sad to think this is coming to an end but it must. There are people at home anxiously awaiting our return.","Stealth campsite by stream

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548992,"Day 3 of the 100 mile wilderness. We woke up super cold. We had a frost warning for last night and it was close. I didn't want to move from my tent this morning. I fired up the stove and made hot cocoa and coffee mix. It's so good I think it's my new favorite thing. We packed up and got on trail at 7:30. The terrain looked like it was gonna kick our buts again and I wasted no time. The descent off of Barren Mt. was steep and slow going. At the bottom we crossed fourth bog and ascended fourth mountain and then had an even worse descent than off of Barren Mt. We then had to climb Mt three and a half which gave some nice views from the ledges at the summit. We then descended and climbed up third mountain which had a great view from the cliffs. Next we descended and climbed up Columbus Mt and stopped at chair back shelter. At this point it was 1:30 and we had only done 6.9 miles for the day. We were kind of discouraged that our pace was not where we expected it to be. We carried on climbing up chair back mountain to a great view of the mountain chain east of us. Then we had the climb down the chair back. A straight shot down a cliff in essence. If you look at the profile of the mountain it looks like a chair. That took awhile to successfully climb down without killing ourselves. We then descended down to Katahdin Ironworks gravel road where we were able to fill up on water as we were out. We carried on fording the west branch of pleasant river and then began the climb up Gulf Hagas mt. We met a ridge runner who told us that after the two mile restriction of no camping we could camp by the creek in a nice stealth spot. We found the spot set up camp. Made a quick dinner and got ready for bed. Another tough day with low miles. Only 13.3 today. On another note Holy Diver summited today and he posted his picture and it's becoming more real. I hadn't seen him since Erwin,TN. Dragon Head and Ninja Geisha should also be summiting today but haven't got confirmation yet as no cell service. Wow it's becoming more real that I actually am close to finishing this thing.","Cloud Pond Shelter

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549139,"Day 4 of the 100 mile wilderness. The cold woke me up at 5am. I was like well I'm getting up, grabbed the food bag and made a huge cup of coffee. Hazel stirred shortly thereafter. The moon was so bright it was like a spotlight on us through the night. I started packing up and she did the same. Ms. Elizabeth was camped a bit of the way down from us. She is so inspiring as she is out here alone hiking this trail in her 70's. Wow! We got on trail at 6:30 which was a record for us. We had a nice trail up gulf Hagas mt. Cake and Haiku caught up to us and we all stopped Carl A Newhall shelter for a second breakfast. We all moved on and summitted Mt Hagas. Cake and Haiku got ahead of us and we went up and over West Peak and Hay Mt. We then headed up White Cap Mt which had fantastic views from the summit. The wind was blowing and the sun was shining. On the north side of the mountain there was Katahdin in the distance, looking as majestic as ever. Wow we have been headed toward this thing for 2100+ miles and there she was a site to see. Afterward we headed down white cap and stopped at Logan Brook shelter for lunch. We then boggied to hike till 6pm to see where we got to. We passed East Branch lean-to and made it 2 miles further north to a pond where we camped on the edge of mountain view pond. It was a fantastic spot. We made dinner and got into bed by 8:30.","Gulf Hagas stream campsite

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549140,Day 5 of the 100 mile wilderness. Well a mental note for future hikers. Do not eat chili Mac at the dead center of the 100 mile wilderness for dinner. Oh my!!! We got up and packed up by 6:30. The rain early morning wasn't as bad as it was supposed to be so that was a big bonus. We started on trail and climbed over Little boardman mt and then descended. The trail leveled off and we boogied. We stopped at Copper Brook Falls lean-to for a snack and continued on. We passed Jo-Mary road and had a great trail. We had lunch at Antlers Campground. We continued on climbing up and over Potaywadjo bump as I called it. The trail leveled off and we hiked into the night as the headlamps came out. We camped by a gravel road in a gravel parking area and did an impressive 24.7 mile day.,"Mountain view pond campsite

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549168,"Day 6 of the 100 mile wilderness. The night in the parking area was fun. We had fun trying to get down to the water in the dark after being exhausted from our 24 mile walk. We laughed and laughed. There should not be precipitous drop off while getting water Hazel said. We made dinner and got ready for bed at 10 which for me was staying up all night. We got up and packed and headed on trail at about 7 and were determined to do 25 to exit the 100 mile wilderness. We were hungry, tired and weak and wanted to recharge and the key was to get out of the 100 mile wilderness. The trail started out flat and we made some good time. We then had climbs up Nesuntabunt Mt. We met up with Outlaw and Beast and hiked many miles with them. We made the descent and stopped and had lunch at pollywog stream. We hiked on refilling water at Rainbow Stream lean-to. The trail leveled off and became root free and we were able to move. We passed rainbow lake which was simply beautiful and climbed up Rainbow Ledges which gave us a partial cloudy view of Katahdin. We descended down off of the ledges and headed for Hurd Brook lean-to for a break. We moved on with only 3.1 miles to golden road which is the outlying road by the 100 mile wilderness. It got dark so the headlamps came out. The terrain became rooted and muddy we carried on exiting the 100 mile at 8:30. We headed to Abol Pines and got a lean-to and had dinner. We didn't settle down for bed until about 11:30. Tomorrow we walk the 10 miles into Baxter State Park to Katahdin Stream campground. My emotions are all over the place and I can't believe I have walked here from Georgia.","Camped at gravel parking area near Nahmakanta Lake

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549236,I woke up at 3am and was like you need sleep. The realization that this is almost to the end is hitting me. This family of hikers out here have truly been amazing. It's going to be so hard to say goodbye. I fell back asleep and woke up around 6 and brought my stove over to Hazels tent to make one last hot chocolate together. This would be our last time camping together and it's bittersweet. We packed up and headed to Abol campground store and restaurant and got breakfast. We got on trail at around 8. The plan was to walk from Abol bridge to Katahdin Stream Campground and Stephen would meet us from New Brunswick and bring us to Millinocket. The trail was relatively flat. We passed a booth where we signed into Baxter State Park. We forded two streams which we could not rock hope and the boots came off. The water was COLD and the steam was deep. Trip (Doug) tried to rock hope and almost made it across but slipped and fell on the last boulder. He didn't get hurt just a bit banged and bruised. We passed Big and little Niagra Falls along the way and nice pond. We crossed by a day use parking area where we sat and had a break. We continued on arriving at Katahdin Stream Campground where Stephen was waiting and headed to the ranger station where we registered. I got my green card which I was hiker 788 to reach Katahdin who had left from Georgia. We had some trail magic from a family of a thru hiker who was waiting for her to come down and finish. We got into Stephens car and headed to Millinocket and checked into the Katahdin inn. We went and had Chinese food and then I waited for Peter and Jeff to show up. We went to dinner and I ate again. Dinner number 2. We got back to the motel and I crashed. Tomorrow I summit Katahdin and this journey ends. Kirk who is the son of Al Cratty (smitty the walking stick) was going to meet us in the morning and summit with me. He was going to bring his walking stick and to see his dad finish the walk. It was going to be an emotional day all around.,"Abol Pines campground

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549269,"Today is the day I finish my thru hike. I woke up at 3:39 am and said oh this is ridiculous. I went back to sleep finally getting up and showering at 5:30. Jeff and I went down to the lobby to meet Hazel and Stephen for breakfast. When I got to the lobby Trooper was standing there waiting for me. She drove all the way from Massachusetts (5 hour drive) to wish me well and to see me on my summit day. I was in tears. It meant so much to me that she drove all that way for a half hour visit. She joined us for coffee at the motel free breakfast. We left at 7 and drove to Baxter State Park. My stomach was full of butterflies as was Hazels. I went in the car with Stephen and Hazel and Jeffs dad peter, Doug and Jeff went in the other car. Jeff, Stephen and Doug were going to climb up Katahdin with Hazel and I. This would be Stephens first time climbing a mountain. We arrived at the park at around 8 and when we got out of the car I saw several familiar faces about to head up. Cake, Haiku, Gaia, Lt. Dan, Feather and bear bait were all in the parking area. We all started up together and reached the sign in booth where Kirk was waiting. It was a moment as we hugged and he showed me the stick his dad made for him. He had a tiny camera and was going to film as we climbed the mountain and interview me about my hike. As some of you remember Kirks dad loved the AT and wanted to Thru hike. He passed from cancer before he got a chance to and I walked his walking stick from Georgia to Maine. Kirk wanted to do a story on my hike and his dad's stick for his work at News 6 in Portland. The interview took about a mile to do while we walked. When we reached tree line the hike got technical. The five of us Hazel, Stephen,Doug, Jeff and I had to help each other get up the boulder climbs. It was hard and kinda scary at times. As for AT climbs this was up there as one of the hardest. I was filled with all sorts of emotions that are too hard to explain. Once we passed the boulder climbs and almost reached the table lands we started seeing familiar faces descending. Old timer, cheeks, outlaw, beast, cake, haiku, Lt. Dan one by one passed Hazel and I. We congratulated them and hugged them not sure if we would see each other again. These people were my trail family. Even though we may not have hiked everyday with them they were out there in it heading north with me. We shared moments that were specific to a shelter, town or part of the trail. I fought back more tears as each one passed finally giving up as the tears rolled down my face. Hazel and I reached the table lands and we could see the last mile to go and the people on the top by the sign. Kirk went ahead to summit so he could film me coming up. We pushed on. The wind was howling even though it was a perfect blue bird sky day. I looked up to the summit and saw a raven circling. This has been a symbol all along the trail that Al Cratty was there and I couldn't believe here at 5000 feet there was a raven. I had seen them all along the trail and even on my drive south to Georgia. I climbed up the last rise and saw the Katahdin sign   and was afraid to walk to it. I pushed the strength and climbed up the that little hill reaching the sign I reached for it and put my head on it and wept. I had done it. I had just walked 2189.10 miles from Georgia to Maine. I looked and saw Hazel at the same spot I was and she said I can't do it. I said get up here and she walked reaching for the sign hugging it and weeping. I hugged here and yelled we did it. We did it. We took pictures. I helped her up on the sign to get her picture. Then I got up to get my picture with Smitty and the Raven came back and circled me landing behind me on a rock. It then took off flying around our heads and I yelled it's AL. We had a truly epic summit and moment at the top. We spent about 30 minutes and headed down as it got cold. We split up at Abol trail down to the campground. Stephen, Hazel, Kirk and I headed down that way while Doug and Jeff headed down the AT. We were worried about getting Stephen down the AT as it was steep and tough going up it was going to be harder going down. Doug and Jeff went down that way as to meet Peter as that was where all the cars were. They would come pick us up at the other trail head. We got out of the woods at 6:30. It took us 10.5 hours to do 10 miles. We met Hazels sister and nephew and some friends from home and all went to dinner in Millinocket. It hasn't sunk in yet that this is really over. Tomorrow will be another tough day when I have to say goodbye to Hazel. For now I'm enjoying this moment.","Katahdin Stream Campground then to Millinocket.

Storm ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549480,"Woke up at 5am again!! I guess sleeping in will not happen for awhile. We headed to breakfast and checked out. Hazel, Stephen, Jeff and I headed to the Appalachian Trail Cafe to have a late breakfast/ lunch. We also went to sign the class of 2016 ceiling tile which the cafe hangs up in their dining room. After we ate we headed out and I had to say goodbye to Hazel. This was one of the hardest things Ive had to do on the trail. Our little trail family was special to me and on most of my hike I never got too attached to a group. Yes I hiked with many but we all jumped around and would see each other from time to time. Luigi, Ompi and the Royal couple I hiked with but we split with the hopes we would see each other soon. Dragon Head and Hazel were the two I hiked the most with and that was about 5 states. When dragon head got ahead we thought we would catch up so it was more of a see you later. This was a goodbye to Hazel for now and it really sucked. We had shared so much, laughed, cried and bonded. Thank god for technology and things like FaceTime. We all got into our separate cars and drove in opposite directions. It was very sad. Jeff and I were heading to Vermont to go to Homecoming and Alumni Council Meeting which we were members of at our college. Hazel and Stephen were headed to New Brunswick to head home. It's not going to sink in that this is over till I get back home to the Catskills. I am grateful for where I live because I can be in the woods in a matter of minutes if I miss the trail too much. I will still be connected to the trail by maintaining pieces of it in New Jersey and New York through the New York New Jersey Trail Conference. I also look forward to volunteering my time at a few hostels possibly next season to support the class of 2017. I also hope I will be able to represent the trail conference at next years trail fest. I never fully understood the Appalachian Trail until I got on it. The trail is so much bigger than I ever imagined. The community is amazing and I have learned so much from them and it. The people out there became my family and some of them I only shared a meal, shelter or a few moments with, memories were created all along the trail in those moments. Specific locations on the trail were captured in time with those around me. The following people will forever hold a special place in my heart. Trooper, Blue Butterfly, Olive's Human, Bug Juice, Grandma, Cinderella, Holy Diver, Ghost, Gaia, Cake, Ompi, Lightning, Timber+ Dexter, Littlefoot, OSHA, Otter, Little Joe, Karma, Luigi, Freefall, Tranquillity, Margarita, The Librarian, Luigi, The Royal Couple (slosh+scavenger), Bowjangels, Waterfall, Mudslide, Gasket, Charlie and company, Hiker John, Sleeping Bear, Smeagel, Snitzel, Crocamole, Lt. Dan, The Dude, C#, Paisley, Dragon Head, Hazel, Wallet, Eagle, Jackrabbit, Breakneck, Avalon, Gretel, Daddy long legs, David, Lazerus, Lumberjack and Ninja Geisha, Red, Crash, Old Timer, Rambler, Feather, Mayfly, Cheeks, Wolverine, Flash, Sneaky Pete, Sage, Quasibird, Spam and Sniper. You all helped create my own hike and I thank you all for that. I will never forget you. For all of you who have read my daily journal and offered words of encouragement I thank you. Knowing that all of you were out there waiting for my next journal entry was a good motivator for me to keep going. Especially on those days where it took every thing I had to move forward. I hope you all enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. Part of my hike which I did not mention much before on here was to raise money for the Catskill Center. This is an organization (non profit) in the Catskill Park which I am a member of that works to preserve the natural beauty and resources of the Catskill Park. I deeply love the Catskill mountains of New York and they were instrumental in prepping me for this thru hike. I wanted to give back to what had helped me so much in training for this. Many have privately messaged me asking how they can give back for taking them on this incredible journey with me. One way is to support my Go-fund campaign to raise money that will directly go back to help preserve the park I love so much. Here is the link. https://www.gofundme.com/moehikestheAT Any amount you could contribute would be greatly appreciated. Please do not feel pressure to do so but I wanted to give those who wanted to an opportunity. For those of you planning on hiking in 2017 and beyond I am an open book. Feel free to email me and pick my brain. If I can offer any assistance I will be more than happy to. If I can help others experience what I did on the AT I will be more than glad to offer assistance. The AT is truly an amazing special thing and it has forever changed my life.","Katahdin Peak. Northern Terminus of the AT

This weekend I got back out into the woods for a ten mile hike and it was wonderful. I met six slash here in the Catskills who Thru hiked in 2014. He was hiking with 2 friends and we chatted for a bit. I was offered an apple from a woman hiking at the summit of Hunter Mountain. I felt like I was back on the AT with dry springs and butt slides to boot. It was exactly what I needed to fill the longing for the trail.
