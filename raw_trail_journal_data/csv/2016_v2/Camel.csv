Camel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537590,"This is a hike prep entry about my food and equipment choices for my section hike from Fontana Dam to Hot Springs. I'm going to include one every time, assuming I do more sections.
Regarding the Title: Titles will have chapter numbers indicating the section and day of the hike. Since it's day 0 of the 2nd section of the AT that I've done, the Title will be prefaced with chapter headings like 2.0. On the first day of this trip, it'll be 2.1. Etc.

Regarding the spreadsheet: The SUMMARY section lists totals by Category, and there is a TOTAL w/o consumables and a GRAND TOTAL. Since these are ""theoretical"" sums of every item weighed individually and may not include all containers, last minute items, and measurement error, the ACTUAL pack weight is also listed. That's what the pack really weighed as I was heading out the door.
All weights are in grams and kg because I'm a big nerd who never really knew how much an ounce was, and prefers to just move decimal points. However, I converted the TOTALs to Pounds under the ""In Pounds"" heading. Items listed only in the Carried column do not affect pack weight unless they are also listed under Unit Weight, meaning that I have 2 of that item, one of which is in my pack.

Anyway, here is the equipment list for this trip:

Unfortunately, my base weight (w/o Consumables) exceeded 5 kg, which I was hoping to squeeze into. Replacing the giant Anker battery pack with maybe a 5-10Ah version should help. My cell phone lasted 3 days in Airplane mode and I never needed to plug into an electric socket during the entire trip, even at the last hostel.

I still ended up roughing it quite a bit, with only one of every piece of clothing except socks. This meant that doing laundry in the shower, or late in the evening when it was cool enough to wear the tights and long-sleeved base layer, were my only two options. Unless I happened to be alone at a shelter, which had a zero percent chance of happening.

For food, I figured 4100 calories per day, not to be exact but because I wanted to add some extra walnuts to the evening meal. I figured 4000 was a good number given my BMR of about 2000 kcal and the lower daily average through the park. The final day was to be supplied completely from food available at Standing Bear, though I did end up saving a 1000 calorie pack of dried fruit just in case.
 


The macronutrient breakdown was 74% calories from carbohydrates, 14.5% protein, and 11.5% fat. There were 800g of carbs, 80g of which were fiber, and 340g of sugar. Of the 55g of daily fat, only 6.7g were saturated. There were 150g of protein, which is my usual daily target.","

My shuttle (AAA Hiker Services) arrived at Fontana around 2PM, on the last day of a multi-day monsoon but in a nice hole in the weather. After drinking the last Coke I was going to see for a while, I walked across the dam and into the park.
I was fresh from two days of complete rest, so the climb to Mollies Ridge was almost easy. The only problem was that my pack was annoyingly heavy at 22 pounds, at least 2 pounds more than I was hoping for, and 4 pounds more than I had trained with. During this trip, I kept saying that more than 50% of the weight was food, but now that I see my spreadsheet, that actually wasn't true. Still, it was nice to eat my way through more than 2 pounds of weight every single day of the trip.
I got caught in a couple of light rain showers, but my hat was enough to get me through it, and I didn't need to deploy my poncho until I reached the shelter and the evening's torrential downpour began.
A retired woman was in the shelter already, all set up in a corner of the lower bunk and in her sleeping bag. She looked a little dubious as a through hiker, with the amount of gear around her. She said she was thru-hiking but jumping around the trail with two cars, one at either end of each section, but I didn't ask for details on how that can be done with one person. I talked to her a little bit and ate a few Clif Bars, but only half of dinner because I didn't want to go down to the water source in the rain.

The first thing she had told me about, though, was the bear that kept coming around the shelter during the day. After I'd been there for a couple of hours, the bear came around again and headed for the food hanging wires, so I yelled at it and clapped my hands to chase it away. It was a bit reluctant to choose flight until we both began to clap.
Near dusk we were joined by a young couple, so I had to move my transverse sleep setup that had my head hidden behind the shelter's tarp so I could keep the bear out of sight and out of mind. Of course, I always bump my head several times a night when I'm on the top bunk. Whatever someone thinks of shelters, at least I wasn't tenting in the rain in a small one-person tent and then having to pack it up when it was wet and muddy.

On the second day, I walked over Clingman's Dome to Mt. Collins. There wasn't too much scenery except for the excellent views from Rocky Top on the way towards the main peak of Thunderhead, and another before Clingmans Dome. I skipped the Dome itself because I've been there several times. If I wanted to be around tourists, I would just go to work.

Physically it wasn't bad until the very end, between the Dome and Mt. Collins. It got to me a little bit, mentally, because it was just so damn rocky. I had just done a day hike from Newfound Gap to Clingman's, with a side trip down the Road Prong trail, but that day I had been rested and carrying a lighter pack. My pack weight had decreased noticeably but was still heavy.

The ecosystem along this part of the AT is quite beautiful, just as it is after Newfound Gap until after Mt. Kephart, or at the top of Mt. LeConte. These must be the parts that qualify as Temperate Rainforest. They resemble pictures of mossy wilderness in the Pacific Northwest, so no other scenery is needed. The trail work along this stretch is interesting too, with wooden stumps and beams held in place with iron spikes. It's like an ancient technology, or maybe Hobbit technology.

Earlier today, I ran across a group of trail maintenance volunteers who were setting up at Siler's Bald Shelter. They were with the ATC and encouraged me to volunteer. I might if I could ever take time off from my second, part-time job, day hiking.
Mt. Collins Shelter was packed. I was not the last to arrive. A couple of thru-hikers had to yield their space and tent behind the shelter. I washed my legs and feet in the grass and went straight to sleep after eating and using the privy. On my way to get water, I did have a short conversation with a man from Indiana who was out with his kids on a loop hike out of Elkmont. Bigger miles make me less social and more interested in business and sleep.
I brought ear plugs and they definitely came in handy, even though I could still make out the snoring of several people around me.

This was an easy and scenic day, with less than six thousand feet of elevation gain over the entire distance. The rocky horse trail right before Cosby Knob did get to me a bit, so I slowed down and only made about 2 mph between the junction with Snake Den Ridge and the shelter.

I forgot to ditch my garbage at Newfound Gap, including those disgusting Wet Wipes that have to be packed out. Ooops. There is also no running water anymore at the gap. On my way towards the Boulevard Trail I ran into the Hiking Club for the Autistic, who were standing around talking about their personal lives and taking up the entire trail. I had to say excuse me several times and eventually just gently push between them to get them to move an inch in any direction. I should have put my hands on my head to expose my ripe armpits, but unfortunately the thought didn't occur to me until afterward. Hindsight is always 20/20.

Besides the obvious Charlie's Bunion, which I skipped this time, having been there before, the highlights of this piece were the views from the trail near and on the Sawteeth. This is also the only real piece of trail that makes you think you're doing something mildly dangerous, since it slopes steeply down to (more or less) certain death on both sides. After the Sawteeth there are at least two more vistas overlooking the SE.

The worst thing about this section was that there were about 7 miles between water sources, between the pipe just north of Icewater Spring and a tiny spring flowing from the rock near the Hughes Ridge Trail junction (Pecks Corner). There were some mossy rock drips along the way, but they were so slow that I think the water would evaporate before I was able to fill a bottle.

I chased a bear off the trail a couple of miles before Cosby Knob Shelter. I also got 4G reception when I had line of sight to the town of Cosby, so I confirmed my reservation at Sunnybank Inn in Hot Springs. When I first made the reservation, the gentleman who answered the phone sounded very doubtful as to my itinerary and requested that I confirm 48 hrs ahead of time.

There was an annoying rocky section after the Snake Den Ridge Trail at Inadu Knob, but overall the hike was so easy that I briefly entertained the thought of being able to avoid the shelter crowd by pushing on to Standing Bear and just taking a full zero tomorrow. Fortunately I wasn't stupid enough to actually try it, because during tomorrow's descent to Davenport Gap, the trail turned out to be not so nice near Mt. Cammerer.

I rolled into another packed shelter with people talking loudly, snoring, and taking up all available space on the shelves and tables. I considered tenting but there weren't any good tent sites left and there was a lot of mud all around. Again, the more miles I do, the fewer people I prefer to be around, especially inconsiderate ones. The Smokies are crowded. It's not the thru-hikers who are the inconsiderate prima donnas, though.
As majestic as the Smokies are, tomorrow I was glad to be done with my home turf and moving on to new vistas. The balance of the 900 miles I owe can be paid off on a series of long day hikes, or by sleeping at the numbered campsites.

I woke up even colder than yesterday and had to do some jogging around the shelter area to warm up. I slept in until 8, but wanted to haul a little ass in order to make it to Standing Bear in time to get the treehouse. Around 7 AM, while I slept, I had turned 40, and now needed comfort.

Maybe three miles shy of Davenport Gap shelter, I ran into a guy with enough stuff to masquerade as a thru-hiker, who asked me how far it was to the I-40. Where I had come from. Ooops.

I told him I was 101% sure I was headed toward the I-40, but read ""NE"" from my Garmin to make it objective. He had gone uphill for three miles in the wrong direction.

I got my last bottle of park water at Davenport Gap shelter and kept right on going. After the I-40 crossing, I missed the staircase going into the woods, so I went back and hiked it southbound, with a nearly empty pack after I'd checked into Standing Bear. There was an orange tassel marking the staircase, so I must have been looking in the wrong direction to miss something so obvious. Morgan, who works at the hostel, said that going southbound was easier, and he was right. To get back up the hill, I redid the hot road walk in my ridiculous-looking desert hat with the built-in redneck preventer, while drinking a Diet Coke that was still cool.

Standing Bear was great, though I suppose it's not to everyone's taste. It has a rustic, handmade look with its own charm. From what I know, most of the things there were built by Curtis, the late owner, and now by Morgan. Maria and Morgan were pleasant and the prices were reasonable, both for stay and for resupply. You can even park your car there for $5/day.

For any fellow vegans out there, the resupply is more limited, but it should be enough to get anybody to Hot Springs whether they are vegan or not, unless they absolutely refuse to eat added sodium. There was even organic oatmeal.
I bought a few sodas, a bag of blue corn chips (skipping the high-sodium salsa though), a few 720-calorie bags of trail mix, a few oatmeal packets, some ziplock bags to replace my worn ones, and a small bottle of hand sanitizer. That's just a small sample of what's available. There is the DiGiorno Pizza and the PBR.

I drank 3 PBRs, and was treated to a 4th by a new trail buddy, who I had first met just before Tri-Corner Knob. He was a high school teacher from GA and a half-marathoner, who hiked a section each year after school was out. At Tri-Corner Knob, he had been lucky enough to witness a bear being tranquilized, tagged, and worked-up by a park ranger and a graduate student, so he told us the story as we sat around the fire and drank PBRs.

As we talked and he learned of my plans, he discarded the idea of HYOH and decided he was going to hike my hike. He was going to try to hike to his car, which was parked in Hot Springs at the Laughing Heart Hostel, on the same ambitious itinerary as me. I wasn't absolutely sure I could make the hike, myself, but I was reasonably sure I could. I had put in the time grinding out back-to-back 20+ mile days in GSMNP over the last month. I had planned a 10-mile nearo that day specifically so I could rest and eat. Meanwhile, he had just finished an 18 mile day from Tri-Corner Knob, which I guessed was probably his longest hike ever.

Anyway, there was a lot of laughter and a lot of stories and sharing around the fire. The highlight of my night was talking with Jolly. He is in the same industry I was in, when I lived in Chicago a few years ago. He really loves the trail and plans 30-day section hikes every year. There was another guy, from the Chicago suburbs, and a guy from West Virginia who taught us about asbestos removal. There was also a young couple, half of whom had to get off the trail for a little bit due to a knee injury. They had a well-behaved Weimeraner who was allowed in the Smokies by virtue of being a service dog and who was doing very well on the trail.

The treehouse I rented was excellent, but I didn't get to lounge around because I felt more social with the small day I'd done, and I had to dump garbage, pare down my load to bare essentials, shower and wash my shirt and shorts, and repack. I washed my short-sleeved shirt and shorts in the shower using the rest of the dish soap I'd brought, and then stood around in the sun for a while, eating chips and drinking PBR. 

While at the hostel, I was supposed to be following my mantra of ABE: Always. Be. Eating. Always Be Eating. ALWAYS BE EATING! Unfortunately, I got distracted by alcohol and conversation and didn't eat as much as I'd liked. My eyes should have been bigger and I should have bought more easy to eat food rather than oatmeal, which I ate with orange soda instead of water.

Finally, I'm shortening my name to Camel, because most people seem to confuse me with CamelBak products, which I have no connection to, although if you're out there, I'll mention you in my trail journals in exchange for some swag. Camel sounds better anyway.

Note: There are two Garmin courses below. The first is the one with the road walk instead of the AT. The second is the missing piece only.

On the final day, I woke up at five but hit the snooze twice before I crawled out and started packing. My beer limit had left me without a hangover, thankfully. My new trail buddy, The Tick (just kidding, Steve) was already awake and looking for a place to shit that wasn't a porta-potty.

Despite the lower elevation, I was still cold and had to put on all of my clothes. I took this to mean that I definitely didn't eat enough. On the way out I gave Steve my hand sanitizer and left my trowel in the hiker box. Don't worry, it had only been used in sterilized potting soil and washed before I left. In exchange, I picked up a couple of organic ""super food"" bars that were all I had for breakfast as we walked down the road toward the trail. We started in the final minutes of morning twilight, just after 6, and didn't need our lights at all.

The first third of the hike was a bit of a grind, with a decent climb out of Davenport Gap making it difficult to warm up and loosen up. The most surprising thing was the beautiful trail tread. Other than some roots, it was smooth and free of rocks, completely unlike the Smokies. It was hiking heaven. I resolved to train for future running events on that section.

There were excellent views of the distance we'd come from the FAA tower at the top of Snowbird Mountain, but Max Patch was even better. By the time we got to the Patch I was in my midsection cruise and didn't really want to stop. Time on trail is also a drag in its own way, in addition to distance, and I don't like to jog (like we had on the downhill from Snowbird), unless the purpose is to haul ass, rather than use the time gained to sit around somewhere, no matter how pretty it is. I can come back and linger on the bald whenever I want; my hike was to hike 33 miles to Hot Springs in one day.

Steve's feet had started hurting so he changed his socks. I reconfirmed my itinerary with Sunnybank Inn. It sounded like it was overkill. I told them I didn't know when I'd arrive but it might be after sunset. In reality I hoped to make it before sunset, except we had already ""wasted"" about 22 minutes on the bald. All in all, though, we were doing fine. Surprisingly good, in fact.

The final third slowly devolved from an easy cruise to a deliberate effort, with eating schedules missed, water sources unpleasant, and systemic fatigue starting to set in. I was surprised at my muscular and joint endurance, however, especially in light of some early pain in the peroneal tendon due to some lopsided trail building work.

Except for the frequent stops, I was able to maintain pace quite well, to the very end of the hike. The biggest problem was the threat of feet turning into hamburger, but the New Balance 1210s performed well with my feet, which I had tried to toughen on Mt. LeConte. I changed my socks and lounged around on some big rocks at the summit of Bluff Mountain while waiting for Steve, and later stopped at some point to apply duct tape to my heel, and to pick at some cracked toe nails to make sure they weren't splitting. The change of socks didn't do any good because they were hand washed, and so had not regained their loft. I started wishing for a deep, cold stream to do a little foot soaking, but it was not to be had until the spring at the final shelter, and it was shallow, muddy, and lukewarm. I started daydreaming about an arrival time that would let me buy a couple of loaves of whole wheat bread and a couple of heads of iceberg lettuce. I hadn't seen a vegetable in several days.

By the time we hit the 30 mile mark near the last shelter area (Deer Park Mountain), I was feeling some volitional fatigue and needed to make the final push alone. I hope Steve made it to his car alright. It was a much more heroic effort for him than me, and he should be proud of himself. But next time maybe take a sleeping bag, at least, instead of ditching all your stuff in order to ""cross the Rubicon"", as he so eloquently put it. I'm tired and a little sore as I write this, on the day after it happened, so I can imagine how much worse he must be feeling. When I left him, I told him he didn't need his headlamp since we had 2 hours left to go 3 or 4 miles. (We were at the last shelter so it was smart of him to check if it worked.) I told him that all we had to do now, relatively speaking, is to walk to the corner store to buy beer and cigarettes. It was the last 10%.

From Green Corner Road to Sunnybank Inn, I hiked a total of 34.14 miles (my first 50k powerwalk, LOL), in just under 14 hours, with 8625' of elevation gain and 8914' of loss, so quite gentle for such a distance. It was the longest hike of my life and a great birthday treat to myself.

My overall pace was a dismal 24:35, but I hope to improve it. The availability of hostels at either end, and the excellent trail conditions, are making me salivate over the prospect of back-to-back 33s. I'll add more running to my travel style, and maybe in a month I'll try it as training for the next AT section, which would be a weekend hike from Tanyard Gap to Erwin. (I did the loop to the Rich Mountain fire tower out of Hot Springs last May.) Wish me luck and no injuries. No single straw can break my back, but the weight certainly can.

Sunnybank Inn is a beautiful old house that would be nice to explore some other time. I didn't sign up for the breakfast because I wanted to sleep in. The night I arrived, I spent some time on the back porch talking with a thru-hiker named Yogi, and Yogiing him some of my new local beer. There is no way I could have drank a six pack by myself and survived. I did get my bread, but Hillbilly Market was closed and so I had no lettuce. Instead I drank V8 and orange juice from the Dollar General where I bought the bread. Since Sunnybank has no laundry and I was too tired to go to the laundromat, I went back to the Dollar General to buy some cheap shorts, a t-shirt, and socks. Because of my hammered feet, I wore three pairs of socks while walking around the hostel, and nearly slipped and fell on my way out the door to sit on the porch.

Note: There is a discrepancy in the generated course vs. the activity itself, which shows 34.14 miles. I don't know how the course is generated but it appears to be an approximation of the actual readings, so I've used the activity mileage in the table above, because it's bigger and more bad-ass.  Unfortunately, the 34.1 includes a chunk where we followed the wrong trail on the way down from Max Patch, until we realized there were no blazes.

Fontana to Hot Springs, June 5-10, 2016



I really enjoyed this section hike even though it was fast and slightly uncomfortable. I can suffer for a few days, but I'm not sure I'd want to thru-hike in this style, except in a drier climate.
In a thru-hike, I might hike according to a time limit rather than trying to hit a certain distance every day. Unlike the Smokies, there's no reason to stay in shelters.
Adding more running would decrease time on trail, which has its own way of wearing you down.
A shakedown weekend or two might have helped with establishing an efficient routine.
I was a layer short of thermal comfort. I should have taken a real rain/wind shell for that purpose, or traded in the 3/4-zip for a fleece shirt. That piece was only for camp since there was almost no time spent hiking in it. It's for the other 3 seasons.
I never needed to carry more than 20 oz of water, but those ridgelines can be very dry, like the piece from Icewater Spring to Pecks Corner.
More fat-free fig newtons instead of cereal and pretzels. They're much more calorie dense. Variety isn't necessarily the spice of life.
Pack calories according to actual daily distance instead of some average. The first day should have been 4 Clif Bars and maybe 500 kcal of dried fruit and that's it. But the 27 mile day felt a little short, as did the long day. Those should have been closer to 5000.
Always Be Eating! Maybe use the Garmin time alarm. I tried to eat a nice mouthful of dried fruit every half hour and wash it down with water, but not eat if water wasn't available and I was thirsty.
Pack some protein powder for recovery days if vegan sources of high protein food aren't forthcoming.
Bring that 52g pair of neoprene gloves.
Bring a real rain hat and save the desert cap for Arizona.
A 20Ah battery pack is huge overkill for a few days and my modest charging needs. My phone lasted about 3 days in airplane mode, day and night. My Garmin had to be charged every night, and on the last day I was afraid it would run out of juice during the last part of the hike, but it did not. I got this pack with the idea that it would be able to charge my camera, headlamp, and flashlight batteries on long trips without hostel stays.
Since I know HTML, I spent way too much time working on this journal!

Physically, I have some DOMS (delayed-onset muscle soreness) but am in surprisingly good shape. I've eaten some vegetables, clif bars, bread, and three glasses of protein powder, in addition to turmeric capsules for the systemic inflammation. Every time I get up from my chair, I feel an incredible ""spring"" of muscle recruitment, I suppose, that hopefully means I'm getting stronger. Joints and tendons are not any worse for wear, than they already were from previous injuries. Depending on how I feel, I think that this weekend I'm going to try hiking the entire Old Settlers Trail with just a daypack, out and back from Greenbrier, which would be about 31 miles, since I owe the piece near Cosby to my 900 Miler effort. It's an easy, flat trail with the biggest threat coming from bramble thickets in the less traveled middle part.

I think that's it. I hope you enjoyed reading the journal as much as I enjoyed writing it. Although I won't get to thru-hike this trail, I was exactly where I had planned to be with a late May start at Springer, arriving in Hot Springs the day after my birthday. Standing Bear was a good place to be that day.","Hot Springs (Sunnybank Inn)
