Cheshire ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518778,"I only decided to go on this journey a little over a year from now and I wasn't going to create a journal until I knew for sure that I was going. I have known for about a month at this point that it is really happening. I had started out planning to go alone, but my dad has been pressured by my mom to go and keep an eye on me. At first it wasn't what I wanted, but now I feel it is going to be better with him there. My dad just turned 60 and I will be turning 23 on the trail. I am in the process of planning the itinerary for the trail. all my gear is read except for some cloths. I really with that my dog was going with me, as he love to hike, but i feel it best to leave him behind, but i will sure be happy to see him when i get back. I live in North Carolina and my parents live in New Hampshire, about ten minutes from Mt Moosilauke, so we will start in Georgia and make our way north to home. Just two months until the start of the trail. I'm very excited, but there is a little nervousness creeping in. I feel I have a strong sense to complete this trail and i hope that is what pushes me. I have faith in myself and I'm not letting anything change that. I am not completely physically ready, but I have some experience with overnight hikes and so I am not totally blind to what I am about to face. My hope is to come out of this, knowing myself and knowing what I want out of life and others.I hope you wish me luck.",,View Entry,"Dec 27, Sun",0
Cheshire ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519004,"Some times I would talk to a person about going in the trail. A lot of them would think that i was crazy, but most would support me. I thought that of all people that might look at me and question whether I was ready or not would be the hikers that I encountered when giving them rides, but they were the most supportive. I loved the rush that i get when I talk about doing this and when ever I talked to other hikers they would have that same excitement. That is the community that I always wanted to be around and because of that I would go on hikes and see the caring people that do this. I don't know what it is, maybe the air or just the feeling of the forest, but the nicest people that I encounter are on hikes. That is one thing I am excited to see once again.",,View Entry,"Jan 03, Sun",0
Cheshire ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519006,"AS I am preparing for a Through Hike I have seem a few suggestions to write down why I want to Hike for 6 months so that I can remind myself when I am feeling down. So here is my 10 reasons.1.) To Discover who I am and maybe what I want2.) To accomplish something that I, alone, set out to do3.) To learn how to take care of myself4.) To know I can work hard and not quit 5.) To find out what I am capable of 6.) To feel connected to nature7.) To clear my head of all the clutter throughout the years8.) To be that apart of the small percent to finish a Through Hike9.) To live free for a bit10.) added bonus of shedding a few pounds",,View Entry,"Jan 04, Mon",0
Cheshire ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520560,"So I've gotten around to planning out the first 200 miles. I've gotten all of my clothes except for a pair of paints. Way to exited to think about this adventure that I've kept to my work, which I hope makes the time fly faster, but it doesn't. I was wondering if I should start earlier then planned, but I'll keep with the plan. Cant wait for my parents to come down and for my mom to see us off. It reminds me of the time I was going on my first trip overseas. I would look in the sky and see the planes and think 'I'll be on one of those soon' and the thrill would wash over me. Now I find myself looking at trees and woods and thinking 'I'll be in that soon'. Let the time fly!",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Tue",0
Cheshire ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521280,"I'm %90 percent sure that I have everything that I wanted before the trip, but its been hard to find time to pack and repack, as well as look around at my stuff. I haven't had a day off in a while and I don't really want one, but I'm starting to feel that I need one. Maybe, I'll talk to my boss. I've been watching the temperature rise and drop and I try to imagine myself outside hiking in this weather and each time I feel excited to be hiking and just to be in nature. I love nature and I've always felt a connection with it. I Feel like for a while I had lost that connection to the grass and trees and this amazing feeling is slowly returning to me. Its as if I'm seeing a odd friend once more and its like we were never apart, yet I've missed out on their many adventures.Just a few more weeks to go.",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Tue",0
Cheshire ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522501,"Its the final countdown duhduhduhduh...duh duh duh..duh duh. So I'm getting prepared and I'm not feeling super ready. Its hard to believe that I will be out on the trial soon. Don't get me wrong, I am very excited, but I know that I will miss people and they will miss me. I'm feeling a little mentally tired and I think this trek couldn't come fast enough for me to worry a little less and to do some deep inside looks. My dad is preparing to come down to North Carolina to where I am. See the beautiful city and then hit the road once more. Looking forward to shutting off my electronics and to be sleeping in a hammock. I'm so ready and yet not. Can't wait to see.",,View Entry,"Mar 05, Sat",0
Cheshire ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522954,"Day one of packing was frustrating to say the least. I have a slightly smaller bag so that I was force not to carry too much weight, but that meant that it would be difficult to get in that stuff that I need. My dad's bag is a little bigger so he ended up with a little more then me and a little more of the weight. The second day of packing was much better and so much less frustrating. So now everything is packed and we are leaving for Georgia in just a few hours. Let the games begin.",,View Entry,"Mar 09, Wed",0
Cheshire ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524008,"First week on the trail has been pretty good. Some rough patches that consist of my legs just being tired. We are over 50 miles in and still keeping a good pace and I think it's time to start adding mileage. Haven't gotten a trail name yet but I won't rush it. Staying here at the Top of Georgia Hostel, what an amazing place. good first experience with a hostel. One thing that is becoming hard is when you hike day in and day out it starts to feel like watching paint dry. Once I get past that battle, I feel I will have beaten the worst part. one thing that has kept me going and kept my spirits up is the people. With all of us together we lift each other up and carry one another and that is why I'm here. I love the hiker community and each day I am reminded why.","Top of Georgia hostel

Cheshire ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526374,"We have finally reached the NOC after a rough week. It started out okay, leaving Franklin and trying to get into the Hike brain, walking a 6 miles a day or so, until the rain came. We had a really bad storm where at 2am my rain fly decided to pop open after a large gust of air. I jumped out of my hammock, which was no easy task, ran around barefoot trying to tie it back down. After I had thought that I had it down, I went to get back in my hammock and it flipped me over and I landed in the mud, then another end of my rain fly popped open again. After a while dad came to help, but I was already wet and dirty. We took a zero day at the shelter to dry our stuff and get the dirt out. Feeling a little bit better, we left the next day and pushed to an 11 mile day, leaving just a mile to get to the NOC for another Zero. We are leaving in just a moment, but it will be a hard day of 7 miles straight up and with a cold. Also I have finally gotten a trail name given to me by Fat Hen. Until the next time I have internet.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Cheshire ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527062,"We reached Fontana Dam and found quickly that this place is a nice one. We grabbed an early lunch with Jolly-rancher then grabbed the shuttle back to the Hilton shelter. We found out that this town was established in 2011 and there are only thirteen permanent residence here and that the Mayer is the manager of a restaurant, and that we were served by here. We had only planned on one zero day, but the bad weather in the Smokies is keeping us back for one more.Dad has finally gotten his trail name as Nightingale, he hasn't fully embraced it yet, but when asked his trail name that is his response. We had another rainstorm and my seem leaked on my rain-fly so we put some waterproof sealant on it and hope that it works. We are definitely gonna see some snow soon and though it wont be for too long, I hope to get past it ASAP.","Fontana Hilton

Cheshire ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529797,"I have reached Hot Springs, NC. It was a tough trip this time. First I had to drag myself away from the Fun that is Standing Bear Hostel after the 420 party, then make it to the top of the mountains while sweating out the beer. We then got soak and had to stop only after 5 and a half miles (that was four days ago and my boots are still wet). My feet felt like they were rubbed against sand paper, because all my sock were wet. Now we're in town and the aches start to move in. there is a Fire that is burning just outside of the town, so close that if you walk outside you can see the mountains covered in ash and smoke. There are shuttles that are rounding up the hikers and taking them around the 14 mile blaze. But I'm still meeting amazing people and seeing some cool stuff. Finally got a chance to talk to my besties, which meant I was on the phone ALL DAY! AHH too many stories to tell not enough time.","Hot Springs, NC

Cheshire ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531324,"We made it to Erwin just in time, well maybe not. we got rained on and we ran into the shelter doing 6 mile in two hours and the second they saw us they handed us towels and drove us to an all you can east pizza place. I lost 20 pounds, but with the food here I may have gained that back. We're staying at Uncle Johnny's Cabin for the day and its a really nice hostel. This past week has been a bit hard, having met some people that I don't care for has been rough. I don't know how these people made it this far, but I hope to see more of the nice, awesome people that have kept me in love with the AT in the next few weeks. I've heard of people planning to quit as soon as Trail Daze is over, so they say that after that it's supposed to thin out a bit, not that I want it too, but It may make this more interesting.With all that I am super excited to catch up with many of the people who surpassed us at trail daze. 9 more days!Love you all!!","

Cheshire ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542363,"Well its been a long time sense I updated. Every time that I saw a Computer I totally forgot. Well I'm still going and have made it to Luray. By this time next week I will be out of Virginia. So happy to have that longer section finally done with. I want to shout out to the people of Luray for being the nicest on the trail so far, hands down. Nightingale and I have sat down this morning for breakfast and talked about all the things we have seen Bears, Deer, rattlesnakes, turtles, Fisher Cats and baby skunks. We've been though a lot in the past few months and have gotten sick multiple times and now that I'm better somehow Nightingale gets shins splints. Cant talk too much, still too much to do so I'll say bye for now!Onward and upwards","Luray, VA
