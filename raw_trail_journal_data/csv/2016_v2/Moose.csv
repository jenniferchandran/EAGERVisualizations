Moose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522856,"Today I had my very close friends come over and we had a farewell party for me. They all signed a calendar to pray for me that day for when I go hiking. We just hung out then later in the evening and talked about the stuff I could face on the trail and about how light my stuff was in my pack . Tomorrow will be my last day in ""civilization"" before I go to head on the trail. We will be shopping for some of my clothes and getting final preparations before I head out on the trail. I continue to ask for prayers as I will soon be ready to embark on a journey that will change my life.",,View Entry,"Mar 07, Mon",0
Moose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523019,"I left the house this morning around 8am. We stopped at Waffle House to eat breakfast and got in a conversation with the waitress. She started going on a rant about people getting kidnapped or killed on the A.T. Josiah whispered ""are you scared yet""? It was kinda funny. We stopped at Neal's Gap and got a few things and then headed to Springer. We got to Springer around noon and took some pictures and said goodbye to the family. Mom started to cry and believe it or not Mariah had years in her eyes. We got to Hawk Mtn shelter about 5. We are camping under the stars. Beautiful weather! Met some cool people. Lots of people on the trail!","Springer

Moose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523164,"We woke up early this morning and got on the trail around 8 am. We had a few tough climbs early on with Sassafras and Justin Mountains. We kept on running into these dirt roads that army rangers have made for training.... it's pretty cool! Sometimes out of the blue, I would hear gun shots and then look around to see where they were coming from. But then I realize they are just the army rangers training. It's crazy that they train right along the trail and late at night! Last night when I was sleeping I would hear some gunshots, and then later on that night there was a helicopter, jet or something that flew really low and woke me up. I thought to myself, ""Why would they be training this late at night?"" and then I looked at my phone and it was only 8:30 pm. I guess I was trying to sleep a little too early. We got to our shelter around 12:45 today and rested for 45 minutes. We then decided to hike another 5 miles to Woody Gap and camp out there. By doing this we are a day ahead and will try to hit Neel's Gap tomorrow with 10 miles to hike. I met a lot of other cool hikers on the trial today. We hiked a total of 13 miles today starting from Hawk Mountain Shelter to Woody Gap. 13 miles was definitely enough and now I am extremely sore.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Moose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523203,"Lat night around 10pm it started to rain. My dad yelled my name like 5 times so he could squish in my very small tent. It was not too bad sleeping but we were squished. It had stopped raining by the time we woke up at 6am. My dad brought no rain gear and the forecast said rain today. So today was my first day hiking alone. It went well. I met some really cool thru hikers and some day hikers as well. While I was hiking up Blood Mtn, I ran out of water and I had 3 more miles to go. Blood Mtn was most beautiful and was worth the hike! The hike down Blood Mtn was brutal and was more like a rock scramble. Not having water and my legs cramping made it tougher. Once I saw the road at Neal's Gap, I had energy. Dad was waiting for me there with a Powerade and a Coke. He took me top a hotel and we are planning on going to a buffet tonight. I am to take some advice and try to stay under 10 miles for the next week.","Woody Gap

Moose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523288,"Today was a good day physically, but very hard mentally. We woke up this morning in the hotel and had a good breakfast. I started early in the morning around 8:15 and was planning to hike 6.9 miles to Hogpen Gap where my dad will pick me up and take me to the hotel again. The thing is that I felt really good and had strong legs and I was able to hike to Hogpen around 12:00. Some really nice folks had set up trail magic and were giving away free hot dogs, chips, drinks and handwipes. It was awesome! There me and my dad decided that I would hike an extra 4.6 miles to a shelter. This was a very hard thing to do because it is going to be my first night sleeping by myself. Before I left Hogpen I said bye to my dad because he is going home for the night. The next couple miles were the hardest for me by far mentally because it was the first time I realized that I am on my own. It was very hard and I cried on the trail while hiking for the next hour and then whenever I thought of my family after that I just started to cry. The last mile I was able to get my feelings together before I got to my shelter. I got to the shelter around 2:15 and met a lot of cool hikers. The shelter is full and the weather is suppose to rain tonight and tomorrow, so I hope it don't get too messy. The one thing that I am looking forward to a lot is that I will be able to see my family tomorrow. This thought is helping me a lot to keep my calm and know that I am alright on the trail. There is a lot of cool people though which also helps with my feelings. Tomorrow I don't know where I am going to hike, but what I do know is that I will see my family which is all I want. Today I hiked 11.5 miles from Neel Gap to Low Gap Shelter.","Neals Gap

I started to hike at 8:00 and hiked through the rain for a few hours. I was able to hike very fast and get 10 miles done by 1:00. From there I met my parents, Josiah, and Candace to say hi and they gave me some soda and good snacks. They also provided some trail magic for some of my fellow hikers (Mudslide, 560, Checkmate, and Turtle). I then started to hike at 1:30 for another 5.7 miles. From there I ran out of water and got very weak. Not only was I getting dehydrated, but I had some very hard terrain to hike. Thankfully my parent convinced me to take some soda along the trail to enjoy afterwards, so I grabbed those and drank them while I was hiking the trail to get hydrated. I was still very weak and had tough terrain and didn't get to my shelter till 5:30. The shelter that I am staying at has a very good view. Now that it is getting darker I am hearing some coyotes howling and mice climbing through my pack. The shelter is talking about how to best cook a mouse! It is way past hiker midnight and I am really tired! I will sleep good tonight. I hiked 15.4 miles today!","Low Gap

I started hiking at 7:45 this morning. It was kinda weird getting up this morning because of the time change. I woke up at 6:30 this morning expecting daylight and all I saw was stars. I hiked 11 miles to Dicks Creek Gap and was there by 1:15. My Mom, Josiah, and Candace picked me up and they took me to eat Mexican Restaurant for lunch!

I was able to sleep in this morning at the hotel and then we ate the continental breakfast at the hotel. After the breakfast I went back to my room and rested for another two hours. Me and my mom then went to Diary Queen and ate lunch before I headed on the trail. Once I got to the trail, I heard the tire on our car get flat, so I waisted another half hour trying to get it figure it out. Thankfully someone was able to plug it up and my mom was able to get home. So I didn't get started till 1:00. I had a great home and hiked 4.5 miles to the next shelter. On the way to the shelter I met no other than four Amish men that were from Michigan. I met people all over the world, but I never thought that I would meet some Amish people, but I guess the trail attracts everybody. I got to the shelter at 3:30 and was able to chill today.

Two of my cousins David Fisher and Kordell Fisher from Pa. also surprised me last night and decided to go hiking with me for about 2 weeks. Their trail names I haven't quite figured out yet. Here are some suggestions for David: Bert, Wifi, Pigeon, Stankbut, or Moth. For Kordell: Ernie, Blackbird, Goose and Korkbut. Any help would be appreciated in this very monumental and difficult desicion. We got up early this morning to pack up and head up to the trail. We started on the A.T. around 11:30 and right away had a hard climb in Albert mountain. We then kept on hiking till 4:00 and found a clear area to camp out away from the trail. We are going to have a good night sleep by sleeping under the stars, and we will get up pretty early tomorrow morning and try to get a lot of miles in.","Washington D.C.

We hiked really fast and were doing 2 mph on some hard terrain. The weather was amazing and we saw a lot of beautiful scenery. We hiked to a shelter at 3:00, but then kept on going for another hour. We wanted to get to a campsite soon so we were running in the trail before we get caught by rain. We then found a good spot to camp at, but have little water. While we were setting up our tents it started to rain. It has been raining ever since and I am staying pretty dry, but Wifi and Goose say that some water is seeping in their tent, but they are mostly dry. Tomorrow we are wanting to hike to the NOC Center, but we will see how far we go. I am not quite sure where we are at, but I think we hiked at around 16 miles today.

We started to hike at 8:15. We hiked at a good pace and had a lot of down hill. We hiked to the NOC Center and got there at 3;00. We had a trail name change! One thing that I have noticed with hiking with Bert and Ernie( Sesame Street) is that Bert (David) just makes stuff up to on the way. One time he just wanted to keep on hiking so he said that on the other side of the mountain has a better rest place even when he has no clue. Another time he also wanted to keep hiking and said that if your feet hurt then it would be better to just keep on walking harder when that is totally false. Me and Ernie get a lot of laughs out of Bert. Also I have noticed that Ernie (Kordel) eats a lot. He will eat his day pack of food, then eat mine and Bert's left overs, then eat like half of the dinner and still be hungry so he eats the next day of food. Luckily we got a day ahead so he was able to eat an extra day pack of food. These guys though are amazing and I am so glad they came along. They bring great company and we are having a blast and making memories. Later on today my family met us at the NOC Center and took us out to eat. We then found a hostel to stay at for the night. It also seems like my sister, Mariah will be hiking with us for a couple days till we get to Fontana Dam, so we will be a crew hiking in the woods.

When we left the hostel I noticed that I left my hiker boots in the truck, so my dad had to drive 2 hours and give me my boots. He is so amazing. I was trying to convince him that I will hike in my crocs just for a couple of days till I see them again, but he resisted and said that he is going to drive and give me my shoes. My dad got to the NOC a little before noon, but once we got everything together we said our goodbyes to dad and left at noon for our hike. My sister Muddy Maid (Mariah) is hilking with us for a couple of days till Fontana Dam. I am excited about that. To start the hike we climbed a mountain that was 8 miles long. This hike was rated the 4th toughest hike on the AT, so it was rough. We got to the top at around 4:30. We decided to hike down to the gap and maybe camp there, but by the time we got to the gap we felt like walking, so we just kept on going. We decided to hike to the next shelter. For the last 2 miles or so, it got dark so we had to night hike a little. We ran out of water and still had to climb a steep hill called Jacob's ladder, or to Bert, Joshua's peacock. So Ernie very nicely ran up the hill a little and got to the shelter before us to fill up some water bottles. We drank those bottles clean. We found out that the shelter was full, so we hiked for like .2 miles to the bottom of a hill to find a camping spot. we didn't get to our site till 9:00. Ernie ran back to the shelter to fill up some more water, while me, Bert, and Muddy Maid set up our tents. It is now late and very dark and I know that I will sleep good.

Once I started to feel the pain I slowed way down and started to hike slowly. We got to Fontana at 3:00 and found my dad there to take us to a Hiker Lodge. There he refueled us with food and planned our days for the Smokey Mountains and take Muddy Maid back home. After that we got some food and rested up in our room watching some March madness.

There is a lot of beautiful scenery here in the Smokies. We got to our shelter at 3:30 and didn't do anything but chill. The shelter was full, so we are having to camp again. I tried to cook pancakes , but that was a total fail and they just became mashed pancakes with a mix of burnt, cook, and a little under cooked pancakes, but they were still good.

They were really cool and gave some useful tips. I hiked about 3 miles and then I run into some more trail magic. I was already full from the other place that I just grabbed a soda.

I felt bad in going because of money and not reaching my goal, but my parents said that it was of best interest for them and I agreed. So I was able to eat some good food and take a shower.

It was very cold and there were flurries when I was hiking up. The higher I got up on the mountain the more I noticed that there was some snow on the ground. I then realized that it would be a good idea to stay at a hostel tonight cause it will be freezing. I hiked up bald mountain then and I would say there was probably an inch to 2 inches of snow at some places, so it snowed some last night. I got down to Spivey Gap at around 5:50 and there was a wonderful couple (Dave and Barb Martin) there at the gap to pick me up. They saw me on trail Journals. The husband, David Martin (Iceman) is section hiking the AT and was happening to hike at the same area that I was. They picked me up and took me out for supper. They took me to my hostel and gave me a free shuttle. I want to thank them for the great encouragement and everything they did for me and all the other hikers. They are a generous people!

I had a great time and enjoyed every second of it. The trail was mostly uphill today and my backpack was heavy from the resupply. I felt like I was going slow all day. The benefit was the higher you get the more beautiful the views are! Right now I am in a big bubble of hikers which is really cool. Lots of people to talk to and meet really great people!

Little did he realize how hard it would be physically and mentally to accomplish what he did so far on this adventurous journey!! He is encouraged and happy that he is 1/2 way, but he knows how many miles he needs to walk yet!! He is also back on the trail this morning and I'm praising God for healing his poison ivy and that I am able to be with him to help take care of it and bandage it!! ??Also little did I know on how God would orchestrate everything and bring awesome people into his life at the RIGHT time!!! Prayer is very powerful and something that I do a LOT....I just want to THANK everyone that is praying for him!! There are also soooooo many names to mention and so I just want to thank all my friends and family for opening your homes, providing delicious meals, giving trail food, hiking with him, giving him money to have a nice place to sleep instead of in the woods ??, giving him a ride, sending him text messages, Facebook messages and providing encouragement!! You'll are awesome and he couldn't do what he is doing without all your support!! ???? -- Andre's Mom","town

Moose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537840,"I woke up really early this morning at 4:30 and got hiking at 5:30. I wanted to get as much miles in as I could before lunch cause my mom needed to go back to Lancaster to drop off my brother. I wasn't going to go with them but then I decided last night to wake up early and hike fast. Right away in the morning I tried to hike really fast and was hiking as fast as I could. Later on in the day I got tired and I slowed down, but I kept going. I got to Culver's Gap at 12:15 and from there we went to Lancaster. Here we r dropping off my brother to go back to South Carolina for a camp. Me and my mom are going to sleep in Lancaster and then head back up early tomorrow morning to go back on the trail. I am very tired for how fast I hiked today. I also don't feel to good but I think it is from a lack of sleep. My poison is going away pretty well, but it is starting to make these open wounds and we are afraid that some wounds are or might get infected, so today we tried to treat them. Today I hiked 17.9 miles.I also want to congratulate Mountain Man for completing his SOBO hike today!","Camp Road

I didn't feel very hikey today so I decided to just hike down the mountain to the Hudson River bridge and there my mom picked me up at 2:30. I took today easy with my mom since tomorrow she is going to go home for a while and I will be on my own again.

When it came to lunch time he got pizza for me and AB and we were able to have a good lunch. This was exactly what I needed with me transitioning back into being alone again. I want to thank Iceman for everything he did for me today, and it was awsome to be able to see him again. Iceman is like a Rockstar to the hiker community! Today I got to Wiley Shelter at 6:00.

I gave a call out too my dad this morning then and told him Happy Father's Day. Today I wished very much that I could have been home to be with my dad and family on Father's Day. The terrain was very tough and I can tell that I have entered the New England states because of how rugged the trail is. Early this morning I also entered Connecticut officially being in New England. Right now I am feeling very down and tired and want to be home. My body is very tired and beat up and needs a long rest time. I now feel like every day my body gets weaker and weaker from the beating of hiking every day. I have talked to other hikers on how they feel too and they feel the same. They are very tired and ready to go home. The outside thing that is keeping us going is that we know we r past half way and too close to Maineto quit. The thing is that I am too tired and mentally and physically drained to keep going. I have never been so ready to go home. It has been too long and I am ready to get back too life and the real world again. Right now I am facing a decision on whether to keep going on my journey or to call it good. I want to so badly to fullfil my dream, but I am so ready to go home. Most importantly I want to do what God wants. I ask that you pray that not only that God gives me strength, but also that I make the right decision on my trip. I hiked 20.1 miles today to a campsite.","Wiley Shelter

I have learned so much on the trail and plan to take that stuff with me as I enter life again. I do plan to sometime finish what I have started and hike up Mount Khatadin sometime. Right now I just feel like going home is the right thing to do and I can't wait see my family again. I am proud of how far I have got and to be honest I didn't think I would even make it this far. This trip definitely didn't go to waste. I have gotten stronger mentally, physically, and most importantly stronger. I have matured a lot and have grown closer to God. I feel like God put me on this journey to teach me things about me, the world, and him. I also think He put me on this trail to get closer to him and I definitely have. I have made amazing memories that I will always remember for the rest of my life. I also want to thank y'all all for yalls encouragement that y'all have gave me.

Moose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571289,"Well guys my adventure to finish the Appalachian Trail has officially begun. I woke up this morning at 5 to leave from new york city. I got on the train at 8 and got to the station in Wassaic, NY.   From there I found a sweet old lady and her grandson take me to the trail head where I left off last year. From there I hike 8.4 miles to Sharon mt. Campsite. I left at 11 and got to the site at 3:15. I had to stop because my feet were beginning to tell me to stop and I knew if I kept going my feet wouldn't appreciate me. I met a couple of people and the first group I met, actually knew who I was, so I guess the legend continues on the trail. Tomorrow I am in a sticky situation on where to go, it is supposed to rain, and I don't have a group to hike with yet. So please pray that I feel encouraged and that tomorrow works out great. Also if u want more of a live update follow me on Instagram at andre5yoder, I will be updating on my story so u can see more recent information on what I am facing.
