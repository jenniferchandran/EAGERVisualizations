Blake Williams,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521151,"Dear World,As I write this a cold and windy snow is blowing in the streets of Chicago dumping it's white fluff over world out side my window. The wind seems to blow the tree limbs back and forth as a warning in S.O.S. as if to say ""What are you doing? Going off for 3 months to hike? Your nuts and it's cold and there are bears, so watch it. This is a warning""As I write this I am in preparation mode for a hike from Springer Mountain to Harpers Ferry. The reasons? Those are many and I'll get into them, but right now I have to continue this preparation and more than anything not let the midwest cold and snow put a damper on the whole thing.

Blake Williams,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524302,"""Grief, when it comes, is nothing like we expect it to be""-Joan DidionAfter my Dad died, December 10th, 2015, I saw him everywhere. Once when I was running around my mother's neighborhood I saw him working on his yard. He was taking sticks out out of the yard as I knew him to do quite often. I saw him with his Exxon hat on and a pair of shorts nitpicking and working and doing as he had done everyday I'd known him in my 33 years on earth.Naturally this freaked me out. So much so that I remember crying in dry heaves and hunched over on Goodwood Ave. and spitting in my sweaty running shorts, wondering if maybe I hadn't imagined it. In my lunatic mind I wondered if that guy in that yard really was him.After the weeks of me being there I saw him less but still saw him. I still heard him in the voices of my uncles, in the voices of my friends. I heard him in myself (I still do). But as grief exists in our culture, there were things TO DO (we are always doing). Funeral arrangements, flowers, family outpourings of love (and sometimes an overwhelming need to help... or worse yet offer up advice), lots of time to spend alone but mostly spent with others. Who picks the music? What about the limo to the gravesite? Wills, paperwork, caskets, thank you cards. Have you eaten? Death certificate(s), headstone, meeting the preacher, taking calls. Did someone get the hair piece? He shouldn't be buried without his hairpiece.FYI --Just in case you didn't know, my father wore a toupee for a lot of his life. A supremely awful looking ratlike thing that scared us as kids when we'd open up his change drawer in the bathroom when we heard the ice cream truck, only to find the rat there ready to bite us and give us rabies. I stayed around my home town for awhile after the services, and relished in the closeness with my family and friends, but inside I was unresolved. As the weeks went by I came back to Chicago and quickly went back to work. Dealing as best with my feelings as I could I'd also entered into a very serious relationship before my Dad's death. The relationship, in concert with the death of my father and unknowableness of the future sent me into a tailspin. What am I going to do? How I do anything?“Grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it. We anticipate (we know) that someone close to us could die, but we do not look beyond the few days or weeks that immediately follow such an imagined death. We misconstrue the nature of even those few days or weeks. We might expect if the death is sudden to feel shock. We do not expect this shock to be obliterative, dislocating to both body and mind. We might expect that we will be prostrate, inconsolable, crazy with loss. We do not expect to be literally crazy, cool customers who believe their husband is about to return and need his shoes.” Joan DidionI slowly glommed onto the idea of getting away, escaping, going elsewhere in my grief and worry and anxiety about the life I was living and the life I'd lost. I turned towards walking which incidentally had always been away for me to sort out my feelings. In years past I'd walked through my depression. I'd walked through anxiety. I'd walked through difficult life decisions. Life can sometimes becomes clearer when one walks.So I looked at the Appalachian Trail. I began to research and explore and found myself attracted to the idea of escaping, but more than simply that, escaping to recover and discover more of who I am, and maybe in some small way recover some of my Dad.I have no expectations about this. I don't expect to find him there. I don't expect to be free of the heartache I feel when I reach Harpers Ferry. But I'm certainly eager.I leave in a week. It's a week to enjoy my friends and my family and get last minute things in order. I've sent my pack to Georgia and I have my mail drop boxes ready to ship. I have enough money in the bank (though not gonna lie I get nervous spending money, but still...I have it so why not spend it on something worthwhile). 1 week, last minute details, Last minute preparations. This weekend was my WFA certification (Wilderness First Aid). I'm not going there blind or foolish and plan on using common sense.A lot like my Dad actually.",,Harper's Ferry,"Mar 21, Mon",0
Blake Williams,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525059,"Here at the Hiker Hostel in Georgia overlooking a misty dark sky with the outline of the Appalachian mountains looming in the distance.Among my group here at the Hostel I am the only one of us that has chosen to do the approach trail of the A.T. starting tomorrow. There are 600 some odds steps to climb and an 8 mile trek up to Springer. I'll stay at the Springer Mountain Shelter tomorrow night and in the 3 days I'll be Suches, GA for a night.Weather is decent for the next few days am I am looking forward to starting the Approach Trail tomorrow.I can't believe I'm here and sometimes I can't believe I'm doing this. That feeling of unease coming here and doing this is starting to abate. For awhile there was a selfish feeling, and a feeling of vague irresponsibility (you can spend that money somewhere else!! what about when you come back?! what about your girlfriend?! don't be an asshole!)Luckily, that is starting to go away but it lingers from time to time.What I notice most so far is the quiet, the still and the simplicity of the trees and the mist hanging in the branches.","Springer Mountain to Harpers Ferry

Blake Williams,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526422,"Hi all, here at Tray Mountain shelter after an exhausting but good day. I made a reservation for The Top of Georgia Hostel on Thursday so my plan is to hike a few miles tomorrow to Addis Gap camp and then Wednesday Ill hike to Deep Gal which will be only 3 miles from the Hostel. That being said I am extending my food out to the next two days. Had a small freakout when I looked at it but itya not that bad. Small bag of granola, several packs of oatmeal, half pound of peanut butter, a summer sausage, one pasta side and a packet of tuna, plus some packets of EmergenC and coffee. My plan tomorrow is to eat oatmeal some peanut butter and the summer sausage with the low miles. Wednesday Ill eat most everything else save for some oatmeal for the following morning.Also I bent a trekking pole today. Grr. Oh well, that's kind of what you get when you go cheap. I can replace on Thursday.I've eaten a good dinner and I feel tired bit good.Looking forward to spending two days recuperating Thursday and Friday.","Springer Mountain to Harpers Ferry

Blake Williams,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526800,"Two days later than my itinerary I tried to match the weather by extending out my hiking days (and my food supply). Unfortunately I underestimated the tenuous nature of the north Georgia Mountain weather and got rained on last night. Also Deep Gap Shelter has a mice problem just so you know (ironically the 3 in the shelter didn't get rained on, plus they had less mice issues, though they did hear them)Lesson learned? Don't count on the weather forecast 3 days out and be diligent about your food supply. Luckily I'm here for another day taking a zero day to recuperate and plan. Ive eaten some pizza and plan to go town later today to resupply.More to come soon!","Springer Mountain to Harpers Ferry

Blake Williams,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526917,"Last night a few of the Hikers and I went to a local ""pub"", i.e. a very cheap beer spot where you can buy a few tastes for a few bucks, so more or less getting craft beer for $2 a pint, which is unreal coming from Chicago. Georgia has blue laws so this guy has a way around it.Either way the thing that I want to comment on is that one of the hiker's I met two nights ago, Antonio, is quite a loud mouth. Northeaster-ner to a ""T"". He does 18 miles a day and carries little food and smokes and complains and talks about women. Last night when I told him I'd be doing a zero day today he called me a ""Sally"".Earlier that day I had a small breakdown on the phone with Naomi, wherein I continued to lament this ""selfish"" thing I was doing when I know so many who are out of work or looking or just poor in general. i'm hardly independently wealthy and I will come back to Chicago a good deal poorer but I can't shake this feeling irresponsibility. When I got off the phone (and trust me I've had more than I few breakdowns on this trip so far) an older hiker with achilles issues came hobbling into the kitchen and said, ""I hate to eavesdrop but I want you to know that you are in the exact right place at the exact right time"". I cried later thinking about that because I needed to hear that. Hopefully I'll start to take it to heart.Why do we compare ourselves to others and why do we need to fill these roles that others try and give us? There are so many reason for people to want to do this and no reason is any better than any other but I think yesterday helps clarify that the experience of this, the hope that it will uplift me and enrich me and inspire me is what I long for. Everyone here is searching for something and I suppose I am too, but I'm not doing it to be macho or extreme or prove my badassery. I'm doing this to grieve and I can say I've been doing that because I've cried almost every day I've been here. I'm doing this to connect and disconnect. And I'm doing this learn more about who I am and what I can do.The Antonio's of the world can say different and live hard, but I want to hike my own hike out here and have an open mind while doing it.","Springer Mountain to Harpers Ferry

Blake Williams,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527579,"Of Mice and Men.Last night was a dilemma for me because I don't like staying in the shelters on account of the mice. They run over your sleeping bag, that can eat holes in your packs and if you're really lucky crawl over your face... I've been traveling now for the last 3 days with some guys from South Carolina. They are as follows:Beef JerkyOld TimerChrisDozer (on account of his snoring, which I can attest too)So last night, knowing it would rain this morning I decided to forego the usual tent and stay in the shelter because taking down a tent in the rain is no fun and I have my sleeping bag (which was $200 at Mountain Crossings...grrr. I'm sure I'll look at Amazon down the road a realize I was overcharged but hey it beat the my 50 degree bag which would've killed me a few days later so thanks Gear Nazi's at Mountain Crossings!)Well, there were mice in that shelter...alot of them. Like the most I've ever heard. And you here them first and then feel them...God, they are awful.Anyway, Chris and Dozer (Dozer is his Dad) have mouse traps they've been carrying and last night was relative ""turkey shoot"" for mice, but the morning we counted 6 mice killed by Carolina posse. It was something and made the night (and lack of sleep on account of their burrowing, nibbling, pitter pattering noises across the floor boards) actually fun.Should I buy some mousetraps while I'm here in Franklin? hmmm. maybe. I will say this, I've heard that everytime a mouse dies and Angel gets it's wings. So, if you're an animal rights activist then realize we're doing work for Angels by killing those mice.Franklin today then back on the Trail for the next several days to Cabin in the Woods where I have two drop boxes with quite a bit of food for the Smoky Mountains. Permit for the Smoky Mountains is printed and I still need to figure out if I carry 6 days of food or do the service they provide at Cabin in the Woods to ferry me half the food 3 days in. Questions to ponder.Well, off to upload photos, do laundry here and resupply at 4pm. I can eat everything.Love,BlakeAka, 420 (My Trail name is now 420 after Neel's Gap on account of the Sweetwater Brewing Company sunglasses I picked up there)","Springer Mountain to Harpers Ferry

Blake Williams,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528207,"Here at the Cabin in the Woods Hostel after trekking for 3 days from Franklin. Covered alot of ground and had my first 15 mile day, but North Carolina downhills do suck. It's almost like the state is messing with hikers,""Oh those switchbacks in Georgia, were nice right? We don't do that.""""Think downhills should be graded coming off a mountain, not here buddy!""So my feet hurt, cause they're small and I have find my placement. That being said I'm super glad to be here and resting and getting ready for the Smokies. My food bag is huge, but I had similarly large bag coming out of Franklin and went through almost all of it so I feel good with that.Will probably resupply and maybe even stay in Gatlinburg half way through. I'd rather push through but need to see how my body and my feet are going to adjust to the terrain ahead. Plan on pushing through too Fontana ""Hilton"" which will be about 14 or so miles.

Blake Williams,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529615,"After 3 days in the Smokies I hiked to Newfound Gap and hitched a ride into Gatlinburg for a few days of resupply.The Smokie Mountains are otherworldly and beautiful and thrilling. There is no other way to describe them and still there aren't enough ways to capture them in words. They create awe is all I can say. This morning I topped Clingmans Dome and really took stock of my luck, my life and this crazy adventure. Truth is every time I feel down or tired the mountains seem to offer some new scenery to replace the mood. Sparse firs are now being replaced by beautiful greenery and seas of white Flowers. Bare balds are now being overrun but butterflies and blades of grass.I had a conversation with my girlfriend awhile back where I came to the conclusion that because I'm hiking my own hike I can let go of my expectations in this. I can let go of my worries a bit and even let go my goal of Harpers Ferry if I want. What I think is that if I get what I need out of this I can go and have no shame in that. It gives me comfort that thought because even if I leave after 250 or 300 or 700 miles I will done something and seen things and had an experience few will ever have.The lesson today is to let go and maybe let God. But because I'm a Buddhist I'll amend it and say ""Live and Let Mountain"" which is entirely the same thing to me.I'm a very grateful man and I guess if had anything to prove or honor in my father it's that simple and profound truth: I am grateful, I am present, I am here.My father was always proud of his kids and I never quite knew why but the older I get the more I understand it. Love isn't always reasonable or explainable. It just is.I know I'm waxing and waning philosophic a bit more than usual but truth be told these mountains will do that. They'll fill you up if you let them.Tomorrow I head out again to finish through the Smokies and head to Davenport Gap and then from there into Hot Springs.Peace and love all,Blake, ""420""","Springer Mountain to Harpers Ferry

Blake Williams,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530759,"Hi All,Here in Hot Springs at the Laughing Heart Hostel and I am both sad and happy to report that today I'll be taking a shuttle into Asheville Airport, from there to Atlanta and then from there to New Orleans to visit family before heading back home to Chicago next Saturday.I came to the decision to leave the trail around the time I got to Standing Bear. The decision was born out of a number of different reasons. For one thing my girlfriend was having a rough time at home with moving and added to that her grandmother, who she was very close to passed away. The strain on our relationship at that point was hard to take.I also had quite a catharsis over the last few weeks realizing that I had approached this endeavor like a thru-hiker when really I was a section hiker. I took my time, I went off trail to explore the cool vistas and I got feeling like I didn't have to make the big miles that the hikers were doing. Though I averaged about 15 a day (which is pretty good!).When I topped Clingman's Dome I had a real epiphany when I was up there. I came to the realization that I'd come here to earn something from my father, maybe respect or pride or even the kind of values he embodied in my mind. Truth is by the time I got there I'd realize I had nothing to prove and the values that got me there and got me here are the same values he instilled in me my whole life: Hard work, integrity, kindness, respect and being present.It was an eye opening moment and one I don't take lightly.I will always miss my Dad, that won't ever change, but I can accept that and instead of trying to escape that I am grateful for it. I hope I never lose that heartache because it's a testament to the bond he and I had and will always have.But believe me when I tell you that while I am leaving now because my relationship needs me and because it feels right to head back, that 420 will be back on the trail. Don't know when, a year, maybe two, but this trail has gotten under my skin both figuratively and literally (though I've had two showers here at the hostel so there is considerably less trail under my skin) Still this trail transformed me, gave me simple truths that few things can and few things in our modern world ever could.Benton McKaye says that the AT is a ""footpath for all those seeking fellowship with the wilderness"". It took me these 5 weeks of hiking to remember that sometimes the wilderness isn't outside of us but often inside. Inside us our great vistas and ravines, dark holes and chasms. Sometimes the journey's we make outside of ourselves are also journey inside ourselves. I am incredibly grateful for this trail and for all it's given me. It's bittersweet to leave and there is so much more to see, but the trail will always be here.Thank you to everyone who I met along the way who read this journal and who offered there support. I am entirely grateful for your kind words.I'll leave you with the words I wrote in the registry at Springer Mountain, one month ago:""I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am. I am. I am."" Sylvia Plath","Springer Mountain
