Mike Mayfield,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522097,"1 month prior to starting my drive down to Springer Mountain. My mom has decided to drive me down and drop me off, which I am grateful for. Hopefully seeing me off will ease her nerves a bit, probably not though. My stress level this month has gone through the roof. I've sold 75% of my furniture and belongings and am packing the rest to deposit in a bedroom at my dad's for 6 months. My mom and dad have been freaking out as bad as me, if not more, and it's all I can think about for weeks.
I notified my work last week I will be resigning, which did not go over well, but it was necessary. I have been there for three years, and starting in a new position just 6 months ago has made this the toughest decision yet. Some say it is irresponsible of me to leave my life and job for 6 months, but is it? Yea.... but who the hell cares, I've earned it  and I have wanted ths for years. Every time I plan this, a new job happens, or I recently moved, or something else crushed my savings account. Not this year, this year nothing is stopping me. 
Every day for the past few weeks, I have woken up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, and many times the first thing I do is go to my computer to recheck my budget, or upcoming bills, or do a gear check at 3am wondering if I am missing something. This was until this morning. I picked up an old fortune cookie off my counter from a few days ago and ate it for breakfast. The fortune read, ""Every 1,000 mile journey starts with a single step."" im not one for superstition, but c'mon... today I feel extremely and unusually at peace. I'm finally settled in the thought of this happening...
IM DOING THIS!!! ... and anyone who wished to join me is more than welcome","

Mike Mayfield,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522645,"    Well I finally secured my plans of getting to Springer. My mom and stepdad are renting a car to drive to Atlanta. We are leaving midnight Thurs morning so that they can drop me off and make it to ATL airport and catch a plane to Texas for my niece's Birthday. I plan on starting my ascent to the Peak of Springer on Thursday, then Start the AT on Fri morning April 1, 2016.      Thinking about this journey, I only have a few goals so far. The main one is to do this hike on my time. I spend my life trying to accomodate everyone else and their schedules. As a nurse, I spend my entire work day as a nurse caring for others, and doing things around their schedules or wishes. This hike is my time. I am going to start out slow for the first week and enjoy it. I'm thinking maybe 50 miles for my first week, slow and steady and get to enjoy it. I will pickup the speed later on.      Another simple goal I have is to finally kick the habit of biting my nails. I have been doing it for as long as I can remember and I have a goal to come home with a full set of normal looking nails on my fingers. Keeping my hands occupied with poles and hiking should help with that.       Well until next time... 24 Days until Springer      ","

Mike Mayfield,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524537,"1 week til I make the 13 hour drive from Philly to Springer. I did my second to last gear check tonight. Setup my tent in my living room and I am sleeping in that tonight. All of my furniture is basically gone, so no choice but to sleep on my sleeping pad and get used to it. I packed my food and gear and looks like my pack will end up somewhere between 24-26 pounds with a 16lb base weight. i've spemt the last few days trying to catchup with everyone before I leave, and I have been to more bars and restaurants than in the last 6 months, which Im not complaining because I have no food in my fridge anyway. well time for bed, Im hoping to take an improptu day hike around Hawk Mountain and test my pack. See you all on the trail hopefully","My Living room floor

Mike Mayfield,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527138,"Nothing’s Gonna Break My Stride, Not gonna turn around, Oh no, Gotta keep on moving.. has been the song playing on repeat in my head whenever the trail gets tough.. Ir definitely got me through the approach trail in pouring rain..I got on the approach trail at 1:39PM in the rain. Gor lost once around a pond because I watched a backhoe drive out of the pond. Once I found my blue blaze, I continued up a paved trail leading to 675 steps climbing up the biggest waterfall I ever saw. The steps took almost 45 minutes to do. I hate steps.. The rest of the approach trail wasn’t bad, except the mud ans rivers. I finally got to the first shelter, I was soaked, I lost my hat, my rain pants were torn to shreds, but I couldn’t be happier. I met a fellow Eagle Scout named Trevor at the shelter. He is from Kansas City and works at Philmont. I met his mom in the parking lot above the falls crying earlier. We decided to hike an additional mile to get the AT start and next shelter. After signing the logbook and pics, we arrived at the Springer Mtn Shelter. I met a father and son (Riddler) ? (who is also an Eagle Scout) from Doylestown, a marine biologist from Hawaii, and a Pathologist from Iowa (Thunder Snarf), and two guys from Georgia. The shelter had an awesome caretaker named Lee. And my first dinner consisted of Instant Mashed Potatoes with Trevors beef Jerky.. meal split between new friends is awesome. That night I was woken up at 1am by the worst storm I think I ever saw, thank god I was in a shelter, but my shoes and bearbag got soaked through…5 Things I Learned On My First Day1) Trekking Poles are a godsend. I used to hate them, but now I am an advocate. The support they give my knees is astounding.2) I Really Hate Steps. After climbing 600+ in one shot, I have confirmed this. To the point wanna buils an elevator in my home.3) EVERYTHING not made of plastic needs a ziploc bag. Waterproofing is a must. After the horrific storm last night, I had a puddle of tea steeping in the bottom of my hanging bearbag.4) Mice will do anything for food. One divebombed this kid Trevor’s foodbag hanging out in the storm from the bear cable.. Impressive for a littl5) There is no right way to do anything out here. 15 people will give 15 recomendations, but the truth is none of us know what the hell we are doing yet.I was sore my first day on the trail, and prob will be tomorrow as well. We found some unexpected trail magic 5 miles into hiking, which led to us finding out about this abandoned/destroyed trail community,complete with creepy cemetery, church, and school that were still around. After stuffing our faces with snacks, soda, and coffee we sat and chatted for a bit. 3 miles later we hit Hawk Mountain Shelter, I was done for the day. I severely needed to get out of wet shoes and socks, dry everything out, and do a little TLC to my feet. Trevor pressed on to a camp about 4 miles ahead, and Im sure we will cross paths again. Tonights menu consisted of Ramen noodles with tuna and parmesan cheese. Went to bed around 830, now im wide awake at 3am. Time to try to get back to sleep.","Amicolola Falls

Mike Mayfield,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527228,"Day 2 Hawk Mountain to GoochBeautiful Day, weather sunny in the 60s but 31 and windy at night. Conquered the silent killer, Sassafras Mountain. Myself, Birdseed, and Thunder Snarf hiked it together. We hiked 7.7 miles to Gooch Gap Shelter, we got in around 2. I took a nap and woke up to the 12 tribes cult in our camp offering us hot tea and preaching. I got up and hit my head so hard I went crosseyed, thank god a kid I just met, Ford, had some advil (I hit my head 2 other times that night). We had a big campfire and “Lord Gooch”, the ridgerunner for Gooch Gap gave out some great trail names and regaled us of stories, one of him kicking a bear in tge head by accident when it was sniffing around his tent. That night the wind was horrible and kept everyone up.Day 3 Gooch Gap to Lance Creek    Hiked 8.7 Miles stopping for a bit of trail magic from the 12 tribes cult. They were making hot soup, bread, and pancakes. All were delicious, they also had fresh fruit and a hiker box where I got to donate some things I didnt need. I stopped up on preachers rock for about 30 minutes and met a hiker named Ethan from Oklahoma. The two of us hiked to Lance Creek where he continued on to Neel Gap, too far for me. the campground was packed and got to meetup with Bird Seed. I also met Lionheart, Old Timer, Beef Jerky, Peaches, and a father and son, a boyscout, who are doing a 5 day hike. Hiker hunger started to set in and we talked about Sushi, steaks, and lobster for 2 hours. This was the last place to stop before Neels Gap unless you own a bear canister, which noone does. Old Timer gave me the Trail Name of Badger, mainly for how I treat my scouts, sorry kids.Day 4- Lance Creek to Hogpen Gap      Hiked 14 miles today, which kicked my ass. Started out good and got an early start to slaughter creek and Blood Mountain, which was way worse on the way down. Finally got to Neel’s Gap and spent too much money, but got a hot shower and did wash. Got my first mail drop, which added 8 pounds to my pack for the last 6 brutal miles with Thunder Snarf and the Dad and son. These were at a steep incline and took 5 hours with many breaks. Finally setup camp and am about to head to bed. Tomorrow I am hiking 12 miles then getting a ride in to check out Helen, GA, which is supposed to be German themed town. will update again when I am able, and a picture post will be coming when I have wifi.-Badger","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Mike Mayfield,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527251,"Day 5 Hogpen Gap to Blue Mountain Shelter11.9 mile day with Thunder Snarf, Gilligan, and The Skipper. Hurt my calf about 2 miles before the shelter, but all is good. Said goodbye to Gilligan and The Skipper as their 5 day adventure came to an end. Met back up with Birdseed and Trevor (Ranger) and had a great campfire to end an exhausting day. We had terrible winds and I confirmed the quilt does not work with the underdrafts from the shelters.Day 6 Blue Mountain Shelter to Addis Gap13.7 miles hiked today. The first half of the day had an overcast with a slight breeze. Tried to make good timing due to forecasted rain in the afternoon. I hit Tray Mountain Shelter for lunch, and the sun camee through the clouds. I had to stop about 10 times throughout the afternoon to put on and take off my hat and jacket as the temperatures fluctuated greatly. I finally made it to Addis Gap and setup camp around 5pm. I fell asleep around 7pm and slept until 7am waking up only to the sound of rain throughout the night. Im a big fan of the Synthetic over down, and definately kept me warm while getting wet.Day 7 Addis Gap to Dick's Creek GapTook a Nero day and only hiked 5.4 miles to the Top Of Georgia Shelter. Shelter was booked, so my mom surprised me and booked me a hotel in town for the night. Took a shuttle to town and after a much needed shower, I am spending the day at All You Can Eat Buffet, Hot Tubs, and exploring local stores while relaxing my legs and getting a fresh start in the morning. Will hit NC Tomorrrow","Hogpen Gap Campground
