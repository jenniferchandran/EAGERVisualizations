My wife will drive me to Maine on Monday, we'll spend the night together in a motel and on Tuesday, I'll hit the trail. I am eager to meet up with Odder. Thanks for your interest and prayers for our tripIf all goes well, I'll be on the trail for 6 weeks before my return homeVan",,Home,"Jul 17, Sun",0

Gare Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542531,"The along awaited Day. Connecting with Odder today (I'm his Little, ""Big Brother"") and he is my Big, ""Little Brother""). Odder has been on the trail for two weeks already and beginning to settle into a trail rhythm (almost)....so I hope to stay on pace, I have my work cut out for me. I'm up for the challenge, I just hope my body will be in sync with my mind...if not, it will have to catch up somehow....Ready, set, go!
Meet up Odder in the a.m. and kissed my wife goodbye for 6 weeks...best kiss in a long time...thanks for the help preparing and the drive up...much appreciated
You Rock!
Hit the trail at 1130 a.m. Wslked 10 minutes and hitched a ferry to the other side of the river.....canoe....2 minutes across...too dangerous to ford to the river due to dams on each side of the river

Gare Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543903,"Ever heard of the saying ""climbing an up hilll battle""?I have a new perspective since hiking....the downhills can be as challenging as the up hills and ""climbing a downhill battle"" can have a similar meaning....different experience using different muscles and strategies with mind and body but nevertheless challenging....I need to chew on that for awhile...maybe even ruminantGot on trail at 10 am and hiked Lti 6:30A lot of steep downs looking from the top of another mountain...got good pics of the big elbows already conqueredSee ms like we are hiking in circles....definitely not the shortest route from point a to b as the trail features the mountain peaks in Maine.   Kind of feel like the Israelites in the wilderness for 40 years....there was a shorter route to the promised land but God had something else in mind....something to learn about him and self...a realignmentOne thing I've also learned about the trail is that you have to travel more than one mile to get credited for a mile","Statton Village Hostel

Gare Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544318,"Ya,as I was saying, the miles are long. If we could travel in a straight line on the path, the mileage would be accurate. However, we often are walking around roots, rocks and trees and looking for the easier climb with each step. I guess you could say we are stumbling and meandering along the path...this adds mileage.","south branch of carabasset river

I'm getting worried so I pack up things and put on my backpack

Gare Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544323,"Had my second fall
Twisted ankle over a root sticking out and fell head first down hill, poles in hand, and slid over a mossy rounded rock to the point in which gravity and momentum equalized
The problem now was getting up
I was facing a significant decline with backpack weighing me down...35 pounds...I couldn't get up
Thinking through my options I decided to rolls to the right and find more level ground
Was able to finally get my feet back on solid ground and beneath was me where they are suppose to be
Arms both badly scrapped, left ankle sore and my shorts were stained green by the moss (sorry about the stains angie??
Pulled myself together and continued hiking
A couple of minutes later, I noticed my Fitbit had fallen off in the fall
What are the chances I would find it back?
Dropped pack and headed back
Much to my surprise the lost little Fitbit was found....still ticking and in fine shape
Thank you Lord
Made it out of the bush to a. Highway.... Very panoramic scenic view of mountains and lakes and about 100 motorcycles gathered at a lookout spot.....that one is for you Harvey ...hmm and me too....biking would be a nice shift in momentum 
Maine is very dry this year....usually get 9 feet of snow in the winter... Last year basically nothing ... Ski resorts never opened
Summer is dry and stream beds ....bogs etc. Dried up...easier for hiking though","little river swift pond campground

Spruce Grove chicks (red eyelids), mommy was fat and ready for the pot...hmm very tempting
Bear scat (no, not mine)...but did joke about it...huge pile right on the pathway
moose poop if very common along the trail
climbed Beamis Old Blue Mountain...3600 feet approx and had the biggest down ever! super dangerous and went on for ever...it was ridiculous 2.8 miles of descent...the last mile was over the top....I thought I went on a hiking trip...it turns out that mountaineering skills are required too...was really hard on the knees and ankles
Crazy dreams in my first couple of weeks on the trail.....not real circumstances but definitely real people and places that I have worked or lived in the last 20 years....Marlee my dog) even had a final ""on stage show""
showing her tricks for the final time (even though she appeared to be very sick and about to die)...what an amazing dog....always ready and willing to please her master, even on her death bed....it was very emotional...","base of old blue mountain

Blessed with some trail magic....Huh, what's that?

Gare Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545141,"Long day, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.
It was a 2 mile hike out to the nearest road...we have been re-connecting with a group of girls, from a summer camp program, from time to time...this was there day for resupply at the road.....when there resupply arrived, they received a very festive breakfast of fruit and chicken....any fruit that you could think of: berries, melons, oranges, apples, watermelon, and legs of chicken....juice, ice tea, (flavoured water, oh yeah...) Once the girls had there initial fill and were on to reading their delivered mail, the leaders invited Odder, Achilles and I to dig in....what a feast, the best breakfast ever! I will never forget the joy and screams that the girls expressed when they saw the food arrive and I must say, the internal gratitude and internal elation of participating in this feast...awesome!
We have much to be thankful for...many of which we take for granted
Leaving with less for awhile seems to bring out more respect and thankfulness for what you have...not just food, family and friends too...
Lessons learned on the trials....oops I mean trails....
Climbed old Spec Mountain....a hard climb...3.8 miles

climbed 4 or 5 mountains today...views were great...I was wiped
ankles very sore, especially the one that was injured...not getting better with the continually pounding it takes when descending and landing on uneven terrain.","Bottom of Muhoosuc Arm

Gare Bear,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545147,"Unfortunately, the condition of my ankles, especially the one I injured during a fall, I had a week earlier has taken it's toll and I have decided that continuing the journey, would not be to the best interest for my ailing ankles.Maine was rugged terrain and New Hampshire (of which we just entered a couple of days ago), is even more rugged...the White Mountains are ahead). I could perhaps continue with the pain but do fear in causing permanent damage to my ankles, a risk that I am not prepared to take...The journey has been great in many ways for me and I am thankful that I had this time away from the busyness of day to day responsibilities and a transition from full time employment to a new life of ""retirement""...(what that means to me will come more clear during the next year...there is a lot of life to live and a lot of me to give...).Mentally I am ready to go home to reconnect with wife and family.Took over 24 hours to get home by bus, with many transfers and a train ride from TO to BramptonMade it home safely at 11 a.m. on Monday August 8thHats off to Odder!
