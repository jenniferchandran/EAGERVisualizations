Big Dipper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563590,"Not much has changed life wise.  I don't think I have any new gear this year either.  Last year I had new footwear, a new tent, and new water treatment, so those are relatively new.  They work and I'm happy with them all.  We did a training hike at Red River Gorge in April which was good, and I've done 35 miles hiking with the Boy Scouts.  I think I'm ready.",,View Entry,"May 07, Sun",0
