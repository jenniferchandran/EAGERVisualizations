Bigger On The Inside,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476098,"What is it about the Appalachian Trail that seems to call to people, luring them in with enchanting music like the sirens of Greek mythology? Not everyone is able to hear the music, but those who do become entranced — bound by a powerful force, a mysterious pull. Some try for years to ignore the music but the tune only gets louder and more compelling as it begins to tug and pull at them. They cannot tear themselves away from its powerful grip. They cannot drown out the hypnotic calls. They are consumed with an obsession that drives them mad until, inevitably, they submit. They know what they must do to quiet the siren — the only thing that will quiet it — they must go to the AT. So they take up their packs and their trekking poles and set out on a long, winding footpath to begin their overwhelming journey of transformation.


This is the story of my obsession with the Appalachian Trail for I, too, have heard the sirens’ call and have been unable to fight the spell. And I, too, will take up my pack and my trekking poles and take on the adventure. There are sirens in the AT, I am sure of it. I wonder what they want with me?",,Appalachian Trail,"Oct 09, Thu",0
Bigger On The Inside,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476231,"I first heard of the AT over a decade ago when I was working at the local newspaper in the prepress department. I had befriended a woman from another department who talked me into doing a women’s backpacking trip with her one weekend. That was when I discovered my passion for nature. We went on many subsequent overnight trips with various groups and during one of our campfire chats, the Appalachian Trail became a topic of conversation. A couple of the hikers shared stories from their adventures section-hiking the AT. They described the many challenges they had to endure during their week-long trek—the difficult terrain, the changing weather conditions, the rodent-infested shelters, the bears and the snakes. They lost me at rodent-infested shelters.


Fast forward several years later. My husband and I did a long weekend trip with a couple of friends. We went to Hot Springs and hiked up to Max Patch, a section on the Appalachian Trail, where we enjoyed a picnic lunch. We stayed at Alpine Court, a little motel where many hikers stay when they arrive in town. And we ate at a pub that was lined with hikers’ backpacks and trekking poles just outside the door (Paddler's Pub, I think it was called). I had my first taste of Guinness there as I took in the ruggedness of my surroundings and absorbed the hiker atmosphere and culture. Something happened inside me that weekend. I discovered that I love Guinness. And that I was addicted to the idea of thru-hiking the AT.",,Appalachian Trail,"Oct 11, Sat",0
Bigger On The Inside,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/477879,"It’s not often that things seem to fall into place, everything suddenly makes sense, and you know exactly what it is you’re supposed to do. At least, this doesn’t happen often for me. I spend a lot of time running around from one place to another, from one idea to another, starting new projects before old projects are ever finished. Many times, to be honest, I’m just lost and wingin’ it. 

I’ve known for a long time that I had to go hike the AT. But I didn’t have any idea what exactly I would be looking for out there — except for maybe a reason as to why it's been calling to me so loudly. Now, I’m starting to think that there might be a bigger plan in play here. It is possible that this journey isn't about me and my own dreams at all. There might actually be a purpose to this crazy obsession of mine — a bigger picture in there somewhere.",,Appalachian Trail,"Nov 06, Thu",0
