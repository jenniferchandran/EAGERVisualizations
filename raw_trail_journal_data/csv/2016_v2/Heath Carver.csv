Heath Carver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519114,"First off let me do a little intro. The name is Heath. I'm from a small southeast Georgia town. I am just getting into hiking and it is all because of a vacation that my family took this past summer to Franklin NC. We had never been to the area but knew there was things we wanted to do, you know the normal mountain tourist things. We went Whitewater rafting ( Paddle In, Bryson NC), shameless plug, rode the train in Bryson, did some gem mining, and did some waterfall looking. It was hiking in Deep Creek Park were I got bit. We had a map telling us where all the waterfalls are and Deep Creek as three. So we pulled in at 7:30pm thinking that is just a short loop, we would be in and out in no time. Getting to the first was no problem, but a wrong turn lead us around the long way mostly up hill. Now we have never been hiking EVER! And did not expect this to be a journey, so here we are myself, wife, and 2 kids ages 10 and 7, in flip flops, taking the long goat trail mostly up hill with no water and only a cell phone with the battery life in the red. About 3 miles in and getting darker and darker, let's just say we wasn't having the time of our lives right then. We pressed on and made our way back to the van. Tired, wore out, and pretty scared out of my mind, but I was hooked. I loved it! While I was doing research on the trip I looked at different places to Whitewater Raft and came across this place where the AT goes right through. Well believe it or not I have never heard of the AT. I know I was born and raise in Georgia, but I must had been sleeping during class when they talked about it. So when I got home I started reading up on it and thinking that would be cool. I read some journals, Red Pandas I kept up with on a regular basis. Then started watching a couple of thru hikers videos, Dixie's and Sam I Am. Each one brought the trail to life. So what do I do, think hey Heath you need to start hiking. I know that being a thru hiker is out of the question but I can hike somewhere. So I've started getting gear together. I've got a pack a Kelty Trekker external frame and a hammock. Going to give it a try Sam! I'm fat and out of shape so I'm starting small. I plan on doing a overnight hike and camp on Cumberland Island for my first adventure and the I want to do the approach trail to the top of Springer to see the first White Blaze. Like I said right now being a thru hiker can't happen cause of being there for my family, but I hope that this is the beginning are a lot of adventures in hiking, and maybre do it in sections, who knows maybe one day I will be a thru hiker, but right now I happy with being just a hiker. Any advise I will take cause like I said this is new to me, but I'm looking forward to it.See yall on the trailsGod Speed!",,I was Bit!,"Jan 02, Sat",0
Heath Carver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519117,"So they say the trip to 1000 Miles starts with the first step. So I loaded my Kelty Backpack up with a 25 lb weight from my never used workout equipment and hit the road. Here in South Georgia we do not have any hills, the only elevation change is if you find a building with a second floor. I take off down the dirt road with hopes of seeing how far I could make it without killing myself. Being that my conditioning is that of a fatman, I did not make it far till I turned around and headed for home. In total the first trip netted be one whole mile of hiking. I know im not blazing any trails at this rate but also know that I will get there with some work. The pack felt fine, it rode on my back and shoulders like I think it should so no complaints there. I figured that my hips would get tired and they did, but again that comes from never wearing a backpack and hiking. My pack total weight is around 30-35 punds right now. I did get a Pur Hiker water filter, so my gear is coming together. See ya on the trailsHeath",,The First Step,"Jan 03, Sun",0
Heath Carver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519119,"This evening me and my son took off for another training hike. I did better with the distance. The pack did not set right though. It pulled hard on the front of my shoulders and made my neck sore. I know that this is just getting use to adjusting it when I take it off and on. I am learning more about this as I go. Not a lot to say, but I am enjoying it. I realize that if my son does goes with my on the trail I don't have to worry about bears, cause he never hushes, but I love this time I get to spend with him.See ya on the trails!Heath",,Second Try,"Jan 04, Mon",0
