Tiptoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540741,"Hello! This trail journal is mostly just to keep my friends and family back home updated on my adventure, but I welcome anyone who thinks they may benefit from my experiences. My name is Kim, but on trail I'm called Tiptoe. I'm currently hiking the Appalachian Trail with my husband, Blunder. We summited Katahdin on June 10th and our goal is to make it to Springer by Thanksgiving. We are both from Georgia, near the metro Atlanta area.",,A Brief Introduction,"Jun 04, Sat",0

Tiptoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540763,"The day we hiked out of Stratton was a great day. We left town around noon or 1pm and still managed a nice 8.4 miles to a tent site. There we found Steady, who was excited to see us and introduced us to two north bounders also tenting at the site (a young lady named Giggles and a man named Scorch). Mr. Clean caught up to us there and we had some good socializing around the fire before bed. We planned to hike a little over 13 miles the following day, but the trail had other plans. A little after lunch, a root jumped out and stabbed my foot. Luckily, my boot took most of the damage without flinching, but my foot did end up with a pretty bad bruise right in the arch. We managed a little over ten miles that day before finding a campsite by a lovely stream. I was able to soak my foot and generally felt better after a good night's sleep.The following day we hiked to Piazza Rock Lean To, which is 1.8 miles from Rangely, ME. It was an 11.8 mile hike and my foot was fine for the first ten miles or so, which made the last bit seem insanely long. During the day, we hiked over the Saddle Backs. Above tree line was incredibly windy. We could hardly stand in one place! And we were above treeline for a solid three miles of the trail. It was an exhausting, but completely amazing experience.The next day, we neroed into Rangely and stayed at this charming place called The Hiker Hut. It was rustic with no electricity and an outdoor shower, but completely enchanting. Walking into it was somewhere between walking into a hippie commune and some sort of fairy garden. Our ""couple's room"" was a small, room similar to a lean to facing a stream with a matress and bug net inside. The hosts were also very friendly and hospitable and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.","Stratton

Tiptoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541363,"7/5/2016Day 26The hike from Rangely was surprisingly tough. It was a short day over easy terrain, so we expected it to be a good day, but it was very hot (I think the high ended up being around 91), extremely buggy, and the trail was strangely open, letting the sun in to burn us. We still were able to finish our day quickly and found a good spot for our tent. Mr. Clean stayed in Rangely for a zero, but most of our group was still together with the addition of a young couple called Butterfly and Dragonfly. We tented by Sabbath Pond Lean To. Beautiful pond, but it had rather large leeches.7/6/2016Day 27The following day was delightfully easy and uneventful. We got to our destination for the day very early and got to camp with a sort of new group of people, including Go-go, Smoke Break, and Karma, who we'd met before but never ended up camping with. We heard a storm was coming in around 2pm the next day, so we went to bed early in hopes of accomplishing a 12.8 mile day before the storm.7/7/2016Day 28We woke up early and were on trail by 6am. We went over Old Blue and Moody Mountain, both of which had rebar pounded into the rock to assist hikers. We didn't make our 12.8 mile mark, but were able to hike 11.3 miles and get our tent up at a campground in Sawyer Notch before the rain began. We also discovered that our tent had a leak. It was small and we managed a temporary fix with some creative engineering by yours truly and a camp towel. We were able to seal it more permanently in town.","Hiker Hut (Rangely, ME)

Tiptoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542064,"7/9/2016Day 30 Leaving Andover, we had pretty decent terrain. The morning went by quickly and we had a pretty easy time killing miles. And then Bald Pate happened. This was absolutely the worst thing to happen to us since that monster Katahdin. Going up it was kind of like an obstacle course. There were several ladders, mostly wooden if I recall correctly, and a lot of climbing up rock faces. At one point there was even a rope hanging down for us to pull ourselves up a slippery rock face. Honestly, for much of the climb, I found that I was having fun. It was challenging, sure, but it kind of tested what I could do. Everything was slick from rain, so that made things harder and a bit scarier, but it didn't really get bad until just before we hit the first peak. By then we were solidly in the cloud that was dampening the land below. It was cold, misty, and extremely windy. The mist made it hard to see where the trail went and the wind made it hard to communicate. We ended up getting turned around a bit and unintentionally retreating. Once we realized that we were going back the way we came, we laid down a little bit of a game plan to figure out where the trail went and charged up the mountain again. This time we made it through the weather. At this point, much of the path was completely exposed with occasional thickets of spruces, so we scurried along as best as we could and caught our breath in these little groves. At some point, the mist and wind got so bad I took my glasses off. They were almost as useless as a blindfold and I felt like they might blow right off my face! Both Blunder and I fell several times on that mountain. It took us 3 hours to hike the 3.5 miles up and down the mountain that day and it felt like much, much longer. We arrived at Bald Pate Lean To for the night and found that the shelter was full, mostly of fellow SOBOs that had suffered the same fate as us earlier (including Butterfly and Dragonfly, whom we'd met in Rangely), so it was hard to begrudge them. We set up our tent and had a nice little rant with the other hikers about how stupid Bald Pate was before bed.7/10/2016Day 31After the trauma of Bald Pate, we decided we'd take a short day and had a nice, slow morning. All of the other hikers left the lean to relatively early, so we were able to move our stuff in to spread out and dry while we had breakfast and coffee. We had a pretty uneventful 6.9 mile day over Old Speck. It was still a little drizzly and wet and a cloud prevented us from getting a good view from the top, but after Bald Pate, it felt like a walk in the park. We got to Speck Pond Lean To and found many of our SOBO friends there already and plenty of room for us in the shelter. The pond nearby was kind of eerie looking. Since we were still at such a high elevation, most of it was completely covered in a cloud. I felt like I was in some sort of scifi movie every time I looked out at it, but it was still beautiful. Unfortunately, it was too wet out for me to get a photo.7/11/2016Day 32This was a rough day. It was finally sunny out, which was glorious in the morning. We actually missed a turn in the trail at one point marveling at the view of the mountains because we'd been in the clouds for so long. The morning was actually pretty nice. Lots of rocks, but that's what you get in Maine. We went down the Mahoosuc Arm with ease that surprised me based on the horror stories NOBOs had been telling us. Blunder commented that he thought it was just a matter of perspective. The Mahoosic Notch and Arm are the first things north bounders encounter in Maine, so they seem extra crazy, but for us the Mahoosuc Arm was just more annoying stuff in Maine. The Mahoosuc Notch is a totally different story. It was totally crazy. It had some definite potential for fun as well. I was nervous a lot and probably overly cautious at first. There was a lot more upper body work than I expected (one time, I even did that cool thing that totally seems fake in the movies where I gripped a ledge with my finger tips and somehow managed to inch my hand up while dangling in the air. Granted, it was like two feet in the air, but I still did it.) and it was extremely strenuous, especially with an extra 20lbs or so strapped to my back. I did slip once and bang my shin pretty hard on a rock, which was the first time I officially bled on the trail. It took us 2 hours and 20 minutes to complete the notch. After that was no cake walk either, but in the end we got where we needed to go and got to meet some cool NOBOs. We stayed at Carlo Col Campground, which was only half a mile from the Maine/New Hampshire state line.7/12/2016Day 33This is the day we finally made it out of Maine! It was a nice day out, but pretty hot. We climbed Mount Success in New Hampshire and got a nice view, but didn't linger for fear of sunburn. The hike itself was pretty uneventful, but enjoyable. We got to camp early (at the Trident Col Campground) and were asleep before it was even dark out.7/13/2016Day 34We were up at 4:30am to make the hike to Gorham, NH on this morning. Anyone who knows me knows that this is beyond insane, but I knew Gorham meant a zero (as well as a shower, laundry, and town food), so it was worth it. The seven mile hike into town went by quickly for us and we were able to relax as we went, playing word games and taking breaks for snacks. I was especially excited to eat at Subway for the first time in several weeks as I'd randomly developed a craving for cucumbers lately. We tented in the yard of The Barn/Libby Inn and reserved a private room for our zero the next day. At the hostel, we met several new SOBO friends who we've been reading about in logs kept at the lean tos: Little Bear, Availability, and Jolly Rancher.7/14/2016Day 35This is today. We moved into our private room earlier and it's super fancy. Gorham is a nice city for sure, super pedestrian friendly, and a nice mixture of chain stores and local businesses. I definitely recommend where we're staying to any fellow hikers or even to vacationers if you call ahead to book a private room.","Pine Ellis (Andover, ME)

Tiptoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544161,"Day 367/15The Barn Hostel shuttled us out to the trail head and we were looking at a pretty easy day. We hiked 8 miles and got to bed early knowing the next day would be longer. We were able to leave some of our food at the hostel because we planned to return after two days of hiking. It made our packs much lighter.Day 377/16This was the day we really sunk our teeth into the Whites. That morning, we met another SOBO hiker named One-Piece who we've been traveling with off-and-on since. We went over Carter Dome and the Wildcats that day, hiking a little over 13 miles. For the most part, it was a pretty easy day. We encountered our fist hut* in Carter Notch. There, the caretaker had fresh baked cookies (3/$2) and we were able to get soup for $2 a bowl. The only part of the day that gave us trouble was going down into Pinkham Notch (pronounced ""Pink-um,"" not ""Pink-ham. I was disappointed, too.) at the end of the day. It was pretty steep and while the terrain hadn't been bad for the rest of the day, we were still pretty drained. When we got down, we called and got a shuttle back to The Barn Hostel, this time to stay in the bunk room.Day 387/17When we woke up, the weather was awful. It was extremely overcast and pouring down rain. We were pretty distressed because our plan was to start The Presidential Range, where the trail was exposed above treeline for 13 solid miles. It wasn't the place to be in bad weather, so we decided it'd be better to take a zero and head out the next day. Our only problem was that The Barn Hostel and Libby Inn were both totally booked for the next night. It made for a stressful morning, but we were able to call another hiker hostel and get beds there. Paul at The Barn was kind enough to give us a ride there and was happy that we didn't have to face dangerous terrain in bad weather. The White Mountain Hostel was one of the cleanest hostels I've seen. It was very relaxing and a great place to zero, even if we weren't planning another break so soon.*Throughout the Whites, the Appalachian Mountain Club maintains several huts for section hikers and vacationers to stay at while they hike around. These each cost over $100 per night, so most thru hikers either skip these and go for the $10 camp sites or ask if they will let you do ""work for stay,"" which means you do some chores and they let you sleep on the dining room floor for free. (This is something they only offer to thru hikers, as far as I know.)","The Barn/Libby Inn (Gorham, NH)

Tiptoe,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544179,"Day 397/18So this day we finally left Gorham for real. We saw some of our SOBO friends at the visitor center at the trail head (GoGo, Smoke Break, and Grandpa) taking advantage of an all-you-can-ear breakfast buffet. We talked about plans before moving on, leaving them to gorge their hiker hunger. The weather was kind of sketchy, calling for thunderstorms in the afternoon, so we were planning to just get over Mt. Madison and maybe work for stay in Madison Hut. The thunderstorms had other plans in mind. The hike wasn't easy. Going up Madison from our end was pretty steep, but we made pretty good time. About half a mile above treeline, we started hearing thunder. After getting caught in a storm up on the Bigelows, we decided it'd be better to get back below treeline, so we sounded the retreat. There was a decent enough stealth camping site as soon as we got into the trees, so we set up and rode out the storm. And the next one....and the next one. There were several waves of storm coming through, occasionally with hikers scurrying past our tent in between. It hailed at least twice, but our tent kept us safe through the night.Day 407/19I'm...still not entirely sure what our plan was this day. We summited Madison early. The weather reports said that the weather would be clear and beautiful, if gusty, so the apparent fog over the top of the mountain didn't overly concern us. I had on my pants and down jacket and Blunder had on his rain gear. As we went up, the cloud thickened and at some point it became obvious that it was raining. The winds were strong and cold and the blowing mists sneakily began to dampen my jacket. I remember at one point we stood at or near the summit, looking at a sign telling us that the hut was only .7 miles away. After that, there was a lot more wind, a lot more cold, my glasses fogging up, more cold, rocks, some dizziness from the altitude....generally, it was a very miserable morning for us that felt like it'd never end. We did finally make it to the hut and I just sat crying of sheer misery as Blunder coaxed me to take off my wet jacket and get my rain jacket on. The caretaker took pity on us and gave us each a hot drink for free. We could hear the wind howling outside, but all we could see were different shades of white blowing past the windows at ridiculous speeds. It wasn't even noon yet. We both changed into our base layer clothes and got dry. We were joined by another SOBO hiker early on named Blue Grass who also braved the horrible weather to get there. At first we planned to wait until things cleared up and then hike to the next hut in hopes of getting work for stay. The longer we waited, the more pathetic hikers streamed in. They were mostly day hikers or section hikers, but a few thru hikers came in. Eventually the cloud cleared away and some people left, mostly people that just needed to clear Madison and go down the way we came up. We knew that there was no way we could make it to the next hut at that point. We asked for work for stay and the hut took us in.   At some point One-Piece joined us at the hut and we met another SOBO named Numbers. The morning was awful and we felt like Mt. Madison was the devil itself, but that night we got to sleep out of the wind in exchange for washing the windows and cleaning out the refrigerators.Day 417/20This is the day we crossed the Presidential Range. The weather was much better, but still extremely windy with gusts up to 75mph on Mt. Washington. We decided that it'd be better to try to join with other people, but mostly ended up sticking with One - Piece, who I must say is very good company. Overall, the hiking ended up being fun in a hard way. The wind was so strong that we could put all of our weight into it and still be standing straight up near Washington's summit. We had beautiful views all day until within about 100 feet of Mount Washington's peak. That mountain was in a super thick cloud. We didn't linger long for obvious reasons and eagerly made our way back below treeline for the night. Day 427/21The day after the Presidentials, we set out to fix a problem. We hadn't seen a single moose yet. There was a campsite called Ethan Pond that several north bounders reported seeing a bull moose at, so we figured we'd try our luck. The terrain was pretty easy for us and we were able to be a little lazy as our day was just over nine miles. When we got to camp, we meet several thru hikers headed to Maine and there was some sort of youth group camping there. After dinner, several of us sat near the pond, but to no avail. Slowly, we began to give up as the sun sank lower and the breeze of the pond grew colder. Blunder and I headed to the shelter around 8:30. We were planning on a long day the next day and an early morning. Day 437/22We successfully awoke at 5am and began our morning routine as the NOBOs slept on. Around 5:30, we heard a clomping sound and looked down the path. Lo and behold, less than fifty feet away was a bull moose crossing the trail to get to the pond. For such a weird looking animal, it pulled off a majestic stride. Blunder and I were ecstatic. We also definitely looked like lunatics, silently expressing our excitement and joy to each other next to a shelter fill of sleeping hikers. I don't think either of us had been that happy on trail up to this point. The moose ended up taking some time in the pond by the shelter, swimming around and eating the plants growing on the bottom. So we set out, excited for our biggest day yet, our moods boosted infinitely from the sight of the moose munching on his breakfast. We hiked well through most of the day, making time at a speed we'd never accomplished before. Things went well until about a mile and a half from where we planned to camp that night when I slipped and hit my shin on a rock. The spot was immediately swollen and it hurt to put my weight on it. Swollen is an understatement. It looked like someone had put a golf ball on my shin and sewn my skin back over it. Every time I looked at it, my chest tightened in anxiety. Blunder grabbed me some ibuprofen and tried to calm me down, but was obviously not very calm himself. We were both thinking the same terrifying thought: it's broken. Using my trekking poles as crutches, we eventually started inching forward. Blunder took my pack as well as his and I had to take breaks pretty often. At one point, a SOBO we'd briefly met a few days earlier named Bent passed us and told us he was planning on camping at the same place. Not long later, he came back down the trail to get my pack from Blunder and carry it back to the shelter, where he'd already left his and told the caretaker about my injury. One-Piece came up behind us and we offered to let her pass since we were going so slow, but she stayed with us and helped me with the trail from behind while Blunder scouted ahead and found the easier paths for me up broad rock faces and helped from up ahead. I don't know how long it took us to get to the shelter once I got hurt, but it did take us four hours to get the last 2.7 miles of the day. In the end, we got there. A thru hiker we'd met before named Steady was there as well as Bent. I was amazed and relieved at how willing the other thru hikers were to help me in any way they could. There was also a large family of section hikers out, taking up about half of the shelter (which is kind of bad etiquette, fyi), so at first we had a hard time fitting into the shelter. Fortunately, some other section hikers saw our plight and moved out of the shelter to tent. It stormed shortly after we arrived and it was tough to get our spirits up again. Day 447/23The next morning felt pretty hopeless. My shin still hurt enough that it was hard to put weight on my left leg. The weather report called for another thunderstorm and we knew we'd be hiking above treeline on Franconia Ridge that afternoon. I took some ibuprofen and we shuffled out to the trail. Climbing Mount Garfield was tough and I had to stop to rest more often than usual, especially on the downhill. It was misty out and the trail was wet from the storm the previous night. We were pretty down, to say the least. When we hiked up to Franconia, as soon as we got above treeline we both had instant flashbacks to Bald Pate. In case you haven't read that entry or have forgotten, Bald Pate was a quite bad experience for us. Definitely within the top 5 worst moments on the trail so far. So, together we looked up at the sheer rock face, still wet from the storm, fading up into the fog as the wind pushed strongly against us and we died a little inside. I think we both would have had panic attacks if we weren't busy trying to reassure each other that we were going to be okay and avoiding the words ""Bald Pate."" And then we climbed up and suddenly, we were okay. Once we got past the scary bit the fog had decided to clear for, the climb was at least acceptable. The wind was still strong, causing us to pause hiking when gusts tried to knock us over, and we could hardly see fifteen feet ahead for the fog, so to say it was easy going would simply be wrong, but it sure as hell was better than we expected. As we continued climbing, we began seeing other hikers and the conditions gradually got better. Soon, I began having fun and really enjoyed hiking over the ridge. At the very end of the ridge, the fog cleared enough to us to get a beautiful view and I decided that I was definitely going to try to hike on Franconia again with better conditions. We hiked down and the clouds gathered up again, threatening to storm. We had luck on our side and was able to get to the protected cooking area at Liberty Springs Camp Site along with One-Piece before the sky let loose. We sat there for quite some time, waiting for the rain to lighten up and chatting with a few section hikers that had the same idea. Eventually we gave in and just hiked out into the rain to try to get to town...and ended up getting a bit lost. We found a visitor center and were able to call a shuttle to take us to The Notch Hostel.","White Mountain Lodge & Hostel (Gorham, NH)
