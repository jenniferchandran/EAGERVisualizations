Signage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517735,"Well I'm going to give this another try! I left Springer Mtn last year on March 2, 2015 and got to MM 313. About 3 miles up, after crossing Devils Fork Gap, I was strolling along, not thinking much of any thing, when the next thing I knew I was on the ground. It all happened so quickly. One moment I was hiking and the next I was down. I do remember hearing a cracking sound as I fell. Not a good sound, I thought!   And so my hike was over! I had broken my leg. I did get to experience something new in my hiking life, that of a trail rescue. The Sheriff's Department and Rescue Squad of Unico County, TN were absolutely wonderful and I will always be indebted to them. From March 30 until now I've worked hard at trying to get my leg and ankle back to Trail form. It's not been an easy task. The leg break actually healed in about 4 months but the ankle has taken a lot longer. This was the first time I'd ever broken a bone, so silly me, I actually thought I'd be back on the Trail in a few months. Now I'm hoping it will be totally healed by February, almost a year later!!That's correct, I'm planning on leaving mid February! Crazy! Stupid! All of those thoughts ran through my head like a train about to go off its track. But I want to be ahead of the bubble, and I want to be able to slow down and take a few more zero days. Last year in March the hikers overran the shelters, so I can't imagine what it will be like this year after the release of the movie, A Walk in the Woods! I'm a fairly slow hiker, and understand the bubble will catch me, but I'd like to be further along when they do and I do know the group will thin out the further north I go. I've acquired a few extra items to help deal with the cold so I know my pack will be heavier when I begin this year. But I need to be prepared for the weather I'm sure will happen in February and March. I've bought a down hood, a new Thermorest neo-air, the one that has a higher R value, micro spikes, tall gaiters, and a Delorme (satellite locator device (having to be rescued off the trail makes you a little nervous about being out there alone)). I'm taking different gloves and over mitts that I hope will work in the cold rain and of course a lot of hand warmers. But I know I will still be cold at times.I had a great time my first 30 days, making many new friends and having amazing experiences and I'm ready to begin this new adventure no matter how far I get, so wish me luck and I hope to see many of you on the Trail! A new beginningComes along with renewed hope.The Trail awaits me!",,Trying Again,"Nov 27, Fri",0
Signage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517746,"Except for a few things that were on my 2007 hike, I have updated my equipment over the past years. My backpack is now an Osprey XO's 58, but in 2015 I lost so much weight the first month the belt didn't fit me. This year I have a plan to fix that but I'm also going to try and eat more.   But overall it worked well and I love the weight of this pack. Another new item, an air mattress, the NeoAir XTherm Sleeping Pad. I'm going to use at the start and then switch to my 3/4 NeoAir light when the weather warms up. For those of you who use them, you know that they're noisy but it beats having your hip bones pressing into the ground. I've tried out the new one in my living room and it doesn't sound as noisy. I've probably used every water treatment system out there. I started out with pills, but didn't like putting chemicals into my body, then a filter pump, next a Steri pen, and now I'm using the all popular Sawyer squeeze. I'm using the lager one as the flow is faster. This one seems easy, light and if it goes bad you just buy a new one. I do carry some pills for emergencies and know I'll need to be careful with the Sawyer in the cold. I guess it will become my new sleeping partner! Over the last years, I've purchased two new Western Mountaineer sleeping bags. My winter bag is a 10 degree and my summer is a 35 degree. Both are light and I'm hoping the 10 degree will get me through mid February to April. I also have a silk liner. I can change out bags when I get to my house in VA , and then have it mailed back to me when I get up north.  I've had been using a Big Agnes Fly Creek SL one tent for the last 7 years, but I have now switched to the B A Cooper SL one. I used it for the first 300 miles last year and liked it a lot. The main difference between the two is the entry way. I really like the fact I can get in it through the side and it has a lot more head room inside as well. I have a Montbell down sweater and down Montbell down vest. Together they weigh around 7oz so I thought having both would be more versatile, and I just got a Montbell wind shirt weighing in at 1.4 ounces! It is so light and I think I'll wear it a lot. And of course I have new shirts, pants, socks etc. I belong to a running program sponsored by FleetFeet of Roanoke, Virginia. It's a great group and I've decided since I have so many training shirts from them, I'm going to wear them up the trail. And they have Icebreaker clothing which I love and will start in that one. Boots or shoes are not something I enjoy buying. I have bad feet, (maybe too much hiking) so I have many pairs of boots/shoes. I have tried all different kinds of boots and trail runners. I really like the Hoka running and trail runners and they just came out with a Hoka water proof hiking boots. It just arrived so I'm going to try them and see how they do. I want to have warm, dry feet during the early months and then when I get here home in April or May I'll pick up my Hoka trail runners.I'll use the same kind of cooking system I've used for years, the simple Pepsi can stove using denatured alcohol. I'll see how it does and may switch if it doesn't work in really cold weather. I'll practice before I leave. I think I'm pretty well outfitted for this adventure but I find I continuously change and update my gear. Leaving in mid-February is scary for me but if I go slow and get off the Trail when I need to, I'm hoping to get ahead of the crowds!

Signage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517833,"And now for a little more info about who I am. I retired from teaching in 07 so I could Thru hike the AT. That year I completed all of the Trail except the last 200 miles, because of a few broken toe joints. It was very traumatic for me to have to stop that close to the end, but I did go back and finished it as soon as I could hike again. Since then, I've section hiked with a group of wonderful women. We have made it from Springer to Cheshire, Massachusetts and will someday finish the trail together. I looked forward to those section hikes, three times each year, to renew my love of nature. When you section hike, you actually learn a lot more about the AT and its surrounding area because of all the planning and shuttles you have to secure. You also get to stay in many small towns, hostels, motels, and B&B's you don't when you are Thru hiking. But the longing to be out there, to Thru hike, had increased to the point of obsession again! On one of my section hikes, I met someone I hiked with in 07 and he said to me, ""Well, you know that the trail ruins you!"" It gets into your blood and you just have to be out there among the white blazes. As I have said, I live near the Trail. I moved to Southwest VA years ago from flat Long Island. I immediately fell in love with the mountains. I went from feeling like I to have my toes in the ocean to needing to have my feet in boots on a path. It started with day hiking but progressed to backpacking, after I went on a weekend hike with my two sons. I caught ""white blaze fever.""In 2014, I took on the responsibility of checking on one of the shelters in the area. About once every month or so, I hike up to Fullhardt Shelter to make sure it is clean and to check the water system. My friend, Derry, who did the first 70 miles last year with me, often goes on this out and back eight mile hike with me and I go with her to hike the Falls Ridge Preserve. She is a master naturalist and volunteers to help take care of an area. I've actually never stayed at Fullhardt, as it is only 4 miles from the parking lot and I was always hiking past it. But it is a good lunch stop. And it is a good resting place, if you come out of Daleville later in the afternoon. We'll see what happens this time. I'm sure if you follow me up the Trail, you might learn more about me as a person than you want to know ??Walk to a shelter Set up your camp for the night Rest your weary bones",,Me?,"Nov 30, Mon",0
Signage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517864,"Roanoke City Parks & Recreation has a hiking program called 7 Peaks in 7 Weeks. You can either go with a guided group or do the hikes on your own. I decided this would by a good way to get in some training hikes and make me accountable as well. I'm doing them on my own as then I can choose the day, time, and order of each peak. I live near the AT and three of the peaks are actually on the Trail. I've done the three AT hikes countless times but never tire of them as they are all spectacular. McAfee's Knob, Dragon's Tooth, and Tinker Cliffs never disappoint me in their unique formations and every hike seems different because of either the seasonal views, the mental attitude you have that day, or the different people you chat with along the way. The first summit I hiked was the Star City Trail on Mill Mountain. Roanoke, Va is known as the Star City because of The Roanoke Star. The large illuminated star was constructed in 1949 and was meant to serve as a seasonal Christmas decoration for the holiday shopping season. The structure is actually three stars that are formed by 2,000 feet of neon tubing and is 100ft tall. The star was illuminated for the first time on November 23, 1949 and can be seen for miles as you arrive in the city. It is particularly beautiful as you drive in at night. There is a network of trails on Mill Mountain which intersect each other, so you could hike many miles on one side of a mountain. The Star City Trail hike is a a total of 3.4 miles. It was a beautiful day as I hiked up alone. I didn't see anyone until I was at the top. Two people were looking out over the mountains. I asked them if the were visiting and it turned out to be a realtor with a client. I told her how beautiful our city was and headed back down the trail. On the way down I met another women sitting on a bench with a dog and we talked along time about hiking, backpacking, and camping. This was my first solo hike since I broke my leg and it felt amazing to be out alone with my thoughts. You don't realize all the emotions you hold inside until you are completely alone with only the trees and rocks to talk to. My second hike in the series was to the famous McAfee's Knob, the most photographed spot along the AT. I went up there with a group of runners whom I've met in the last few years doing different training programs with FleetFeet. The day turned out to be perfect for hiking except it was Sunday. I generally avoid weekend hikes up the Knob as it becomes way too crowded. But we had a great time and then went to eat at the Homeplace Restaurant at the bottom of the hill. This is always a must stop for Thru hikers as the food is delicious and it's served family style (they just keep filling your bowls until you can't eat anymore! I met two South Bounders coming down as we were going up and they did not know about the restaurant, so I explained to them that they should give it a try. They were leaving stuffed, as we were going in My third summit hike was up Read Mtn. It's not part of the AT, but it's a nice hike up to a view of Roanoke and the surrounding area. I did this one solo also and did not see any other hikers the whole up and back hike. Next I hiked Dragons Tooth, via the Boy Scout Trail. Even though it is only 5 miles round trip this is a great hike to build up my stamina and confidence. If you take the Boy Scout trail up to the AT, then to small clearing called Lost Spectacles, then up to the Tooth, the workout is phenomenal as there are some steep parts and a some rock scrambles. I met a section hiker going up and he said that this part caught him by surprise. Also there are a few hand over hand, pull your body up, parts especially for someone who is 5'2"". And coming back down is a challenge as well. But, I will try to do this hike many times before February. I have two more summits to do in the next few weeks. Tinker Cliffs, which is on the AT and one of my favorite hikes and Sharp Top which is not on the AT but close to it at the Peaks of Otter. I've done both of these hikes many times but as always looking forward to seeing the sights again.

Signage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519062,"I hope that everyone had a wonderful holiday season and a happy new year. I've was so busy the month of December and then got a bad cold for the New Year, that I haven't done very much in the way of training for my hike. But as of January 4, that has changed. I've started a regiment of walking, hiking, and running to try to get my legs back into trail shape.I took my pack to Willow Mt. to have him shorten the belt, as last year, after a few weeks in, I was having trouble getting it tight enough. He did a great job and added a connection for my small front pack. So now it's time to put some weight in the pack and get a few miles under that belt. I got nervous about leaving in February and being cold, and also, last year I hiked with someone who had down pants and loved them so ordered them and down booties. They add oz but hopefully I can send them home after the Smokys. So now I figure with my down hood, jacket, pants, and booties, I have a whole sleeping bag to put on and then get in my 10 degree bag. That should do it for all my gear, now I just have to pack it all in my pack. On Monday I hiked the Boy Scout trail up to the AT and made the 3 mile loop with about 20 pounds. I know that's not a lot of mileage, but it has all kinds of terrain with a few good rock scrambles along it and doesn't take all day. The weather was cold, blustery, with snow showers, perfect to try out clothing choices. I put about 20 pounds in my pack. It was the first time I've had a pack on since I broke my leg. It felt wonderful to be out again after a month of only running and no hiking. Maybe Thursday I'll go up to Fullheardt Shelter as I haven't been up there since I broke my leg. So as the real countdown begins and the excitement builds, I'll read the journals of those who have already started and the others who will come behind me!!Forty days to go!Nervous and excited to Start this adventure",,A cold day!,"Jan 04, Mon",0
Signage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520567,"I did get up to Fullhardt Shelter with a new hiker friend, Sandie, but we couldn't clean the fire pit as it was frozen solid! I guess between the rain, hikers pouring water on it, and the freezing temperatures, the ash and dirt turned to a solid. I hope it warms up a bit in the next week, so I can clean it up before I leave. I had forgotten what a nice hike it is even without any views. Sandie and I talked and laughed all the way up and back down, getting to know each other better. I've hiked McAfee's and Dragon's Tooth, a few times, each time adding more weight to my pack. I'm feeling stronger and my shoulders are becoming less sore with each trek up a mountain. All my gear is purchased, my boxes are ready to be mailed, plane ticket purchased, and reservation made at the Hiker Hostel, so it looks like all I need to do now is wait for February 13 to start this adventure. I've been wondering a lot lately about what makes the Thru hiker have this passion/obsession to even attempt to hike 2189.2 miles. I know from reading others' journals, talking with hikers, and completing over 3000 miles on the Trail myself, there are many different reasons people want to hike. And we do seem to have some things in common: the love for the outdoors, being one with nature, escaping... (Fill in the blank: city, relationships, a loss etc) are high on the list of reasons to start, but we can all fulfill those reasons by doing other, less strenuous adventures. What is it about hiking the AT!! Right now, for most of us planning this trip, it is almost the ONLY thing we are thinking about. As we sit watching tv or a movie, driving a car, listening to music or others etc, our minds wander to packing our pack, doing gear reviews in our head, obsessing over weight, weather, and a myriad of other details, we need to think about before we embark on this journey. Even trying to go to sleep at night or waking up first thing in the morning, all our thoughts travel down that path of the AT. We don't seem to be able to control our thoughts as the wander along the foot path of our brain. And the only way we will quiet these thoughts and feelings will be the day we arrive atop Springer Mtn and take our first steps toward Katahdin. In only 11 days, I will accept this challenge, and walk off in my own solitude! Good luck to all my fellow adventurers.

Signage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520802,"They say you pack your fears. Well, as you can see from the picture, my biggest fear is being cold. Because I am leaving February 14, I know I'm going to hit some very cold and possibly snowy weather. This year, I have added more cold weather gear to my pack. I have packed micro spikes, hand warmers, three pairs of gloves, a pair of extra socks, a wool buff, hat, and headband. All that down may be overkill, but I know, if I have it on, and get into my 10° sleeping bag, I will be warm. One of my biggest complaints of last year was that I had cold feet at night. So this year, I purchased down booties! Last year my feet would stay warm, if I wrapped them in my down jacket, but then I didn't have my down jacket to wear. Last year, a friend I hiked with, had a down hood and when he'd climb in his bag wearing that hood, I would be jealous. And another hiker had down pants, and he said they were his favorite piece of gear. So there you have my reasons for acquiring all that down. The combined weight is 14 oz and I can get rid of it and the added winter gear as the weather warms up. I don't really have the fear of running out of food, but I did lose a lot of weight last year, so I do plan on trying to eat more! Also I need to try and drink more this year. I'm going to try to camel up in the morning and when I get to a water source, drink, and carry less water on my back, especially in the south. After breaking my leg last year, one of my biggest fears is falling. But, I don't really know how to deal with that except maybe to slow down. This year I'm taking more zeros, and I'm not going to worry about getting to camp or making the miles, and I'm going to really hike my own hike.And now for my NOT fears. I'm not afraid of how hard the trail is going to be; I've done it, it's hard. I'm not afraid of animals; they're out there and you have to be careful. I'm not afraid of being alone; it's a lonely trek and it takes a long time to hike over 2000 miles. I'm not not afraid of pain, as long as the pain moves around. I'm not afraid of hiking in the rain; it's the AT, it's going to rain a lot. I'm not afraid of getting to the top of that mountain, which ever mountain it happens to be; if I put one foot in front of the other and just don't stop, I will eventually get to the top, no matter how long it takes. We all know that the trail is a metaphor for life: so if I work hard, put myself out there, face my fears, put one foot in front of the other, don't judge other hikers, I will make it: as long as I don't get seriously injured. Oh and keep enjoying myself most days!!!!With only seven days to go, my stomach is doing the flip-flop hike. One day, I'm great and I can't wait. The next day, I am scared to death to start this adventure again. But, it is going to happen one way or the other. My list is getting checked off, my pack has been packed and unpacked, and I'm boarding that plane next Saturday!To everyone out there, I can't wait to meet you. I can't wait to begin my stories of 2016!And for those that are reading my journal and following along on my adventure, I want to thank you. And thanks for writing, encouraging me, and inspiring me!

Signage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521094,"I was up at 3:00 AM to get ready to fly to Atlanta. But of course, to get anywhere from Roanoke you must go through Charlotte. Both flights were easy and without incident, always a good thing. I arrived at Atlanta around 9:00 and started my trek towards retrieving my extra bag and then to hop on the Marta. I was very glad to see my large red duffel circling the baggage carousel! How do you replace all those items that you need to start this journey. I had kept my backpack with me. It contained my most important and expensive items, such as my sleeping bag, sleeping mat, tent (except the poles), all my new down purchases, rain jacket, chargers, etc as you just can't go out and buy those items but would need to order them. But it was there, and I let out a sigh of relief when I caught a glimpse of as I came up the escalator. I have never ridden on the Marta before, so another new experience was about to happen. I did find it easy enough, but couldn't get my credit card to work and some wonderful gentleman helped me with that. Then, I found myself standing alone on a platform when another gentleman directed me to the other side and explained I need to get on that one to get to the red line. I finally made it and, of course, went out the wrong gate, to wait for the Hiker Hostel and had to be let back to locate the correct spot. After a short time, Duffy arrived to drive me to the hostel. I'll be glad tomorrow when I only have to follow the white blazes!! Duffy was a great conversationalist and I really enjoyed the hour trip. We talked a lot about hiking. He and his wife have retired and are now working here and then at the end of the season will go up and work at the Hiker Lodge in Millinocket ME. Maybe I'll see him again. I arrived to a pretty empty place so chose a bottom bunk and got busy trying to fit all my ""stuff "" back in my pack. I know I had it in there once! So the rest of the day I just hung around, not doing much of anything, except enjoying the warmth!

Breakfast was at 8:30 and delicious. In the middle of the night, I had idea that if I was the only on going to Springer maybe I could pay extra and they could slack pack me the .9 miles to the start. They didn't really like it but they did and Duffy actually hiker with me. It felt great just hike there without a pack. We took pictures and I started. The trail was actually better today than it was last year. It was dry the whole way. I met Slipper and Tripper as I was heading out and again at Stover Creek Shelter for a break. As the day progressed I got more tired with each mile, my broken leg started hurting, and the temperature began to drop. There was a section where I didn't see a white blaze for awhile. I know I shouldn't panic but as you walk along you imagine all sorts of things. Did I miss a turn off? I was on a logging road and often the trail does shoot off sharply, but finally I saw one and breathed a sigh of relief. When I'm alone I tend to panic more. It took me to almost 4:00 to get to Hawk Mtn Shelter. This was the fourth time I've been there and that was the longest it has ever taken and this first day is not hard trail. When I arrived, the Two Peas, Moonbeam and Big Cypress greeted me. We had been talking on line for a few weeks so it was great to meet them. I but my bed down in between Slipper and Tripper and the Two Peas. Some younger hikers had taken the top part. I started to get my gear and dinner ready as it was getting so cold so quickly. I spilled some water on the picnic table and it instantly froze! I ate and got in bed at 6:30! It was going to be a long night. All my new down really helped. I especially liked my hood. It was like instant warmth and it really helped at night in my bag. And the down booties also kept my feet warm all night! That was a first.

I didn't get much sleep but the whole shelter was slow to get up out of our warm bags. It was 9:00 before I was ready to hike out and I had no feeling in my fingers. It took over a mile before the pain of feeling started to let be know they were waking up. And then it was about 10 minutes of awful pain before they were fully back and functional again. I won't start out like that again. I will make sure I open up hand warmers in the morning. Today we walked in a could of ice mist. Everything was coated with sheen of ice that you couldn't see. Our pack and rain gear became coated and every rock, piece of wood, and log you stepped on was slippery. I was extremely fearful of falling, which I hated. I didn't like hiking in this state of mind. I had lost the joy, I associate with being out here as I watched where I placed each foot. I struggled out of High Tower and Horse Gaps and then there was Sassafras Mtn. This is the first big up of the AT and I felt every step. I resorted to counting 100 steps and the resting. I've never done that before. I tried to relax and enjoy the time. It was beautiful! The world became coated in white. I took many breaks today in spite of the weather. I reached Gooch Mtn Shelter around 3:45! I couldn't believe it had taken me that long to get there. Last year I was at this shelter by 1:00 PM. My broken leg was killing me. I've come to the conclusion my leg and my body was not ready for this hike this year! My mind was there but that was even becoming an obstacle. I was getting off after only 2 days. I was so disappointed and discouraged but in knew it was the right decision. I love hiking and wanted to be able to continue in the future. My broken leg felt like lead and I was waking up each night in pain. This was also a good spot as I could hike 5 miles tomorrow and get off at Woody Gap and go back to the Hiker Hostel and get back to the airport easily. The young hikers were talking about getting off in 2 miles for the night but when I told them my plans they decided to go the 5 with me. Decision made I snuggled down for the night.
