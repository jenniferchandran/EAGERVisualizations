Eagle Eye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531674,Beginning to plot first part of this years hike. Trying to figure out what to pack seeing how the weather isn't being what it should be for this time of year. Looking at what to get for food for this years hike. I think I am gonna go with more no cook meals then I have in the past. Cheese and pepperoni were awesome last year. Specially for lunch on the go. Looking into other foods for this years trip. Anyhow it is what it is and I will figure it out over next couple of weeks.,,View Entry,"May 06, Fri",0
Eagle Eye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535360,Finally packed the pack last night with everything but the food bad. That will happen on Monday. Change of plans for my start date. The wife and I talked things over and we are leaving for CT on Monday instead of Tuesday. Works out better for both of us. Doesn't force her to rush everything and gets me to the trail a day earlier and I get to have an extra day on the trail. Life is good. Next post will be from the trail.,,final changes,"May 28, Sat",0
Eagle Eye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536239,Started out of Kent this morning. Hiking wasn't to bad at the start. The the up and up and more ups. Great views of the Housatonic Valley and river. Coming down of Calebs peak was tough. I think the imported the rocks from the White Mountains. After that a great walk beside the river. Cp site is awesome on top of some hill. Coule from CT here with me and more folks coming in. Ran into a total of seven hikers today. One going it barefoot. Anyhow that's all for now. Gonna get camp ready for tonight.Life is great on the trailSGM,"mi 1467.1 kent ct

Eagle Eye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536257,"Tough climbing through CT. There's just one hill after another. Not used to it yet but doing okay.

Eagle Eye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536456,"Woke up to gentle rain this morning. Pretty much stopped while was packing up. Headed north this morning and stomach was still bothering me. Made the biggest climb of the morning, made a phone call to a hostel listed in the book. They had room but couldn't get me till noon. I walked into Falls Village and went to a place called the Toymakers. Nice little old fashion store that serves breakfast and dinner. Had large chocolate milk and poached eggs and toast. Took my time eating and then sat and waited for my ride. Was picked up and brought tithe Bearded Woods Hostel here in Sharon. Without a doubt the best hostel I have ever stayed at. Dinner was awesome. Seven other hikers here tonight and very homey here. Will beheading out in the morning. Hoping the stomach problem is history and I can get back into my rhythm. Only 27 miles till MA. Weather is good for tomorrow but looks horrible for Sunday. Oh well. Today was my Nero day. A day we hike some miles but still take time to relax and clean up. I needed some time to just chill. Plus the hostel did my laundry for me. Anyhow feeling better ang going to bed. Later,SGM","Sharon Mt camp site. 1486.1 mi

Eagle Eye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536645,"Spent the night at Bearded Hostel with Hudson and Big Lu. What an awesome couple and hosts. Being hikers themselves they understand hikers very well. Food was awesome and plentiful. Really such a deal. The total cost includes dinner and breakfast. There's ice tea and lemonade in the fridge for hikers all the time. The hostel and rooms are made for hikers and everything is built and fashioned that way. And oh yeah, they do your laundry for you. One can't ask for more. Hike 7 miles to get there. Stopped in at the Toymakers country restaurant on the way in. Awesome place to stop and get a bite to eat. Owners were very nice. The locals kinda looked down on hikers a little but hey. Still having problems with this stomach thing. Every time I drink water it flares back up. Almost like acid burning. And then there's just no appetite. After hiking ten miles yesterday I couldn't even think about eating. Normally I bite your arm off if ya reached in front of me. Not a good thing for a hiker. No food going in and burning calories like mad just leaves me with no strength. Anyhow was a beautiful day on the trail yesterday. So beautiful here in this little corner of CT. Later,SGM","1490.7

Eagle Eye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537144,"Left Bearded Woods Hostel this morning after a great breakfast. Was able to eat a good breakfast and felt fine. Said goodbye to Hudson and then Big Lu took me down the the bridge where she dropped me off and I hit the trail agaim.Great hiking along the river and then to see the falls along side the road before heading up into the hillsAs it turned warmer and I began to drink my stomach decided to remind me that it was still there. I hiked into Salisbury and made a call over to Maria McCabe to see if she had room for me for the night. She said yes so over I went. When I got there she was feeding chipmunks from her hand. She said hi and offered me a cold soda. It was great. Checked in and unpacked and hit the store for some chocolate milk and a snack. Not much of an appetite . Called it a day and went back to the house and went to sleep.Another day on the trail,SGM","mile 1490.1

Eagle Eye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537146,"Asked Maria to take me to the hospital in Sharon that was 8 miles away. she said yes and dropped me off.Waited about 10 minutes before being called out back by the nurse. EKG and all that good stuff. Then the doctor came in and said they were gonna draw blood, do testes and start an IV. All done with no problems.While sitting thee watching TV, my good friend Arron came down from West Simsbury to check on me. The Doc had come in an said you have XX%$#@ and I had to ask her to say what it meant. She said you have Lyme. So now I get another IV with the Doxc in it and whatever. Finally done and was paroled. Stay on meds for 14 days, go easy and stay out of the sun.We left, went back up and picked up my stuff and went with Aaron to his family's home to spend the night. Andrea came and picked me up the next day.Just a minor set back. Planning on going back to CT and hiking up thru the last of it, into MA and stop at Williamstown.Feeling better today and on the mend,SGM","Maria's Place

Eagle Eye,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539875,"Back on the trail today after spending time recovering from Lyme. Nice to be back out here. Weather was nice all day til around 1500. Started to sprinkle our and had to change plans. There was a tent site up ahead so I went over. Set up tent in sprinkles but was fine. Been steady light rain since I crawled inside. Hopefully get a good nights sleep. If it pouring in the morning I might just stay right here. No need to have to hike if I choose not too. Was great to see the sign for the 1500 mile mark today as I hiked on. Was even better to see the sign now entering MA. But I must admit, hiking through this little corridor of CT is really something special. Met bunch of hikers today and talked with them. Met a ridge runner and talked with her for a minute. Then met an AT group of trail maintainers. We talked for a few and I thanked them for their work on the trails. Without a doubt the best I have seen on this journey. Not much else. Got a text from Andrea that she made it home okay. She puts up with a lot from me and trying to help me make this dream come true. That's about all for today. Little soggy on the trail tonight, but I be bone dry. SGM","rte 41. Salsbury. mile1499.6
