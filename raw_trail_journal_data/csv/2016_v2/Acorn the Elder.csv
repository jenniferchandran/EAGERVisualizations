Acorn the Elder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520886,"""There is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path."" Morpheous c.1999. 
Here is what I believe to be true. You cannot train for a ultimate-month extreme sport. There is no end point where you can stop your sweating and announce: ""I am ready!"". What you can do is find a point on the continuum of training where you are ready to launch for a two week entrance to the trail. After two weeks of not using some muscles they will atrophy. This occurs when you place a patient in an ICU bed or for an astronaut in space. Muscle wastes away with a lack of use. The muscles you do use for two weeks will grow and strengthen assuming you keep your calories and protein intake up and you do not abuse yourself and kill muscles cells by asking too much of yourself. So, train to survive the first two weeks. At the end of 14 days if you have succeeded you will know. You will know.

I do believe that the trail teams of Pennsylvania choose, quite actively NOT to provide a tread that does not require ankle twisting rocks.   Cursing and scrambling through the state I would often note an old and abandoned back country road that did not have a rocky tread. I would observe that it is possible to build a trail to a good trail IF one chooses to do so. Flitting in and out of NY-NJ on this section. The trail follows the border between the states.

Henry David Thoreau did not invent thru hiking in 1800;  Geoffrey Chaucer did in 1386:

“Whan that Aprill with his shoures soote 
The droghte of March hath perced to the roote,
And bathed every veyne in swich licour 
Of which vertu engendred is the flour; 
And smale fowles maken melodye, 
That slepen al the nyght with open ye 
(So priketh hem nature in hir corages), 
Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages.”

And so it is that I too choose to go on a pilgrims journey.
I will be flying into Albany, NY in mid July and hike north from there.   I had hoped to start earlier and beat some of the humidity but life does happen.   I have purchased a pair of expensive Nike shorts which are supposed to be the cat's meow for chafing.   I really don't like humidity, especially between ones' thighs.","A Date is set!

Alas, the gods had it out for me.To summarize this section:July 24-  Green Moutain Hostel.  After a bus ride up from Albany I supplied (no re-supply as of yet)And slept on a very comfortable and clean couch.  A good re-immersion into the Trail after a years' absence.  It was here I met up with Groceries with whom I hiked until she needed to take a few days off trail for her to (much younger) ankle.July 25 Mile 1660.8 at Peru Shelter.  Here came the realization that the Vermont Long Trail is really, real popular.  Crowded trail.   Met a delightful young woman hiking with her Golden Retriever before being deployed to Afghanistan.   I called her the most dangerous US solider to be be deployed as she speaks Arabic and will, by her presence empower women.  Much more dangerous than any 50 caliber.  July 26.  Greenway Shelter Mile 1675.3. Hot and buggy.July 27 Yellow Deli Hostel in Rutland at mile 1683.1.  Something to be said of hitch hiking in the company of a woman.  One looks less dangerous for being an old man.  The Deli was just as welcoming and friendly as my visit last year.  A must resupply point on the AT.July 28 Cooper Lodge Shelter Mile 1694.5.  On top of a ski resort.  The brush was thick enough where we walked to a cleared ski run in order to look over the view.  The poor shelter has been destroyed by vandals and the wooden tent plant forms were full.  Camped down my the water source.July 29. Stoney  Brook Shelter Mile 1710.8.  With permission of my fellow shelter guests I set up my mosquitoe net inside the shelter to keep the bugs and mice off.  It worked!  Grocery went off Trail to heal.  GOt  a great 500kCal ice cream sandwich at the state park where a shower was very welcome!July 30. A view spot above the valleys at Mile 1729.4.  It was late, I had water, there was a patch of grass and the sky was clear.  I simply set up my tent just off trail and embraced the night.July 31  Hanover Mile 1747.0.  Here I met Bill and Betsy who were Trail Angels extraordinaire.  For days there has been a list of TAs in Hanover circulation up and down the Trail.   Delightful small college town.  The Senior Center has showers and laundry available where one can clean up before being picked up by a TA.  The trail has a number of coolers on the road just as you enter into the north bound road walk.   Wow.At mile 1737just as you cross over the White River was a group of hikers on the porch of a partially painted house.  IT is one of those establishments which provides bunk room space for hikers but tends to cater to a move partying vibe.  Still, it was nice for a cup of joe and conversation.August 1 Moose Mtn Shelter at Mile 1757.9. THis was a dry camp but I had humped water up from earlier in the day.  No moose to be seen.August 2 HExacuba Shelter.  THere must have been a grad team of engineering students designing this one.  Set on a steep hillside it was nice enough even with the one hiker and a very old and grumpy dog.  Still, no bear showed up that night.  There is a unique sound of what happens when a hiking pole tip leaves the suction of mud:  'Schlup' is what I describe it as.August 3rd.  Hikers Welcome Hostel Mile 1785.8   Okay, this was easy to get to and the warden was nice enough to run us into the rather minimal store/deli for dinner.  Very rural and poor section of the state.August 4 Eliza Brook Shelter Mile 1807.2.  Started in sun, dived into rain, a complete whiteout on top of Mooseilauk Mt.  This was my introduction to what the AMC claims is 'Trail maintainance'.  Ugh, naught but rocks and hand over fist scrambles.  It is easy to get volunteers to paint white blazes and perhaps build log spans to get over muck but to build a trail by cracking rocks?  For that you need a payroll.  Here I met up with a young man who choose to share that he was just out of a psych institution and off his meds as he did not like how they made him feel.   Fortunately, there were other hikers present and he kept his manic level at a tolerable level.  Had I ever learned his name I would have called in a welfare check for him at the next road crossing.August 5 & 6.  Three years in the making PCT hiking pal Hog and I finally met up at Highway 1-93 at Mile 1815.8.  He drove down from Vermont (how did Vermont get north of me again?) and brought me to his home for two nights.  How delightful are the friendships of the Trail!AUgust 7.  A long, rock climb up out of I-93 lead me to Galehead Hut at mile 1829.0.  HOg had told me to spend at least one night in a hut and as it was coming down in buckets this seemed like a great night to do so.  $140 for a bunk bed and two meals.  Interesting.  THe famous skits put on my staff in homemade costumes (in this case bagels were used for the hair curls of princess Liela of Star Wars fame) were cute and simple.   Food was plentiful and I was out of the rain.August 8 Ethan Pond Campsite Mile 1840.8 Started in the rain but it cleared.  The pond in the evening light was beautiful.  This was a caretaker site and I paid $10 to sleep in the shelter.August 9 Lake of the Clouds Hut at Mile 1854.7.  Now this is where my foot started to hurt.  No real single event just soreness that got worse and worse.  I did do a work for stay at this hut (another experience to do once) and got to sleep on the dining room floor. Plus I got left over dinner and breakfast.  August 10, Osgood Tent Site Mile 1865.0  By now my foot was really hurting and the Whites have trails that would qualify as rock scrambles anyplace else.  Still, it was a beautiful day and the later afternoon descent of Mt. Madison was slow and beautiful above timberline.  The wooden tent platforms were most welcome in the moist forest.August 11 2017 Pinkham Notch at MIle 1869.7  Off trail.  Went into Gotham and stayed at the Barn Hostel.  As primative as it sounds.  Dinner with a couple of thru hikers, a nights sleep and then into Boston for a flight home to heal.  10 days later and I can finally walk without much pain.   The Trail will be there for me in the future.","Manchester Center Mile 1650.7

A room at the AMC lodge was $200.  I passed.  I went across the road and did a throw camp by the Ledges.  The first day to Carter Dome was naught but brutal.  Class III-IV over the Terrible Twenty Five’ slabs.  Ah, the locals love to scare the tourists.
The AMC hut at Carter Notch hut was $100 for a bunk.  The only thing they do not charge for is water.  I pushed on to Carter Dome we’re I ran into Spills and Mass Hole who remembered me from the PCT in 2014.  We really are a Village!

July 2, 2022

It was a long trip from home to Pinkham.  The airlines over promised and under delivered and I spent an unexpected night in Toronto.  However, it was great!  Met up the Magellan for a delightful meal of remembrances of the PCT in 2011.  Trail friends can be forever!

Got to Boston, caught the five hour bus to Pinkham Notch just as the sun was setting.  The bunks had a special of $200 so I found a bivy site up the trail a bit.  A pretty, pretty night.

Went back to the hotel for BF and then started up (and  mean ‘up’) the trail.  The local call this section the ‘Terrible 24s’.  It seems that there was to be 24 distinct rock faces to climb to the top of the chairlift.  And that was only the start of this section.  
At Moriah Trail Notch Hut there was no camping allowed and the Hut had a special of $110 per bunk.  My, I wish I owned stock in the AMC.

I pushed on to Carter Dome and put down a camp.  I had carried water up the trail so all was good.

Come dinner two more hikers arrived:  Masshole and Spills.  Trail Magic happened with Masshole remembered me from the PCT in PCT.  We chatted from 10’ away as they both had a fever and a cough.  There were planning on getting off the trail in Gorham to be tested for COVID.  I hope they did well!

July 3rd, 2022 I met up with frustrated (from a previous year’s partial thru hike) Hillbilly and Moonshine from Virginia.  Hale and hardy were they!  At one side trail they saved me 2 miles of hiking by sharing a litre of water. Thank you.  We pushed on, up and down to reach Imp Campsite.  Nice and dry.  A couple skinny dippers for entertainment.

July 4th & 5th:  a short hike and car ride to Gorham at the Hiker’s Barn.  Got flea bites on the ankles but a couple of good meals in town.

July 6th:  a rainy, rainy day to Full Goose Shelter.   Discovered my pack cover  was actually the VBL socks from Everest.  Opps.

July 7th, 2022

Why I do NOT sleep in Shelters:

First, there are the mice.  The little devils chew and rattle and run across you face all night long.  You know, in DC the city releases neutered and feral cats at each round-about to deal with rodents.  The neighbours tend to adopt them on the job.  Come winter the city sets out life traps and brings the felines into the warmth until spring arrives.  May shelter wardens would consider such a program.

Second, mosquitoes.   Buzz, buzz, buzz and chomp all night long.  Back in 2017 it was so bad in NY that it was routine to set up personal mosquito nets to sleep under.

Third, ass-holes.  Here was my latest experience.  It had been raining hard in Gorham but I started early and on July 7th, 2022 I rolled into the shelter at Speck Pond at mile 1917.  It was empty and based on previous shelter experience I set up my mosquito netting.  Other hikers rolled in at the day progressed.  At about 6pm a young man whom I will call ‘Red’ (red shoes, red short, red hair, red beard) rolled in and screamed at me (and I quote):  “ You’ve got to move your fucking tent out of the shelter.  No one puts up a tent in a shelter!!!”. 
 I replied (quite taken aback) :  “ I do.  It keeps the mosquitoes off me and the mice from running across my face.”

He screamed:  “I don’t give a fuck.”

Well, he kept a running, profane commentary much to the delight of the other hikers.

Having hiked 10k miles over the years and on several continents I have always considered the trail community to be some the nicest people around. It has been like Disneyland.  Yeah, people have discussions but I had never, ever seen anyone on a trail act like this.

 Red was way out of control and I, an experienced psych nurse could not deescalate the situation.

My observation of the AT (v. the WT, INT, AZT,  WCT and PCT) is that there are hikers who hike for fun, hikers who drink too much, hikers on [psych] medications, hikers who should be on psych medication and hikers who are self medicating with heaven knows what.  Having observed the ‘AT Rats’ on the PCT in 2014 I knew there were some very east coast attitude and criminal activity on the AT that has not yet reached the west.  This individual’s behaviour allowed only for him to HYOH but not anyone else’s.  Perhaps, he was a bully in HS or was frustrated 5th grade hall monitor.  I can only speak to his behaviour.

Now, you will ask why I did not slug him.  1st, I am 70yo and am more fragile that I used to be.  2nd, I did not who his friends were in the shelter and I did not want to get jumped.  3rd, he was not worth it and 4th. He never touched me.  
So, I gathered my gear and went to a nearby the platform.  
Never again will I attempt to sleep in an AT shelter.  I have a thousand miles to finish the hike and my tent will do just fine if it helps me from being assaulted.  Hooray for sleeping platforms!  The get you off the mud and drain rain water away.

 But they are handy for lunch if it is raining and no one is smoking in the shelter.

 

Another reason to not use a shelter:  ever notice how people that snore always fall asleep before anyone else?  I hope someone invents a BiPAP machine for hikers.

 

July 8th  Andover.  An easy hitch after yet another day of up and down rock faces.  My average daily miles is about 12.  I hitched into two for BF and found a historical marker (my kids hated the fact I would stop and read ALL the historical markers) about Telstar [satellite] receiving station was in this town in 1962.  I actually re member watching a B&W image of a French guitarist singing in that ground breaking broadcast.  Hitch out of town I got a lift with a local (Scott Cox) who was an electrical engineer and had worked on the antenna in town.  We had great nerd conversation!   That afternoon the trail went straight up, again.

July 9th:  Bemis Mtn Shelter.  Hmm, I wrote nothing down about this shelter at all.

July 10 & 11:  Rangeley and the Lakeview Motel:  I wish I had a Piper Super Cub on floats…..

July 12th:  Got soaked during a downpour.  By the time I got the tent up there was a ½” of rain inside the tent.  This is a different rain from the West Coast.

July 13th:  Stratton.  
July 14th:  More rain.  “Occasional showers” baloney.

July 15th Dried out on Little Bigelow

July 16th:  Attached both my Goshawk and a grouse.  The birds really had it in for me.  Plus, I fulfilled a bucket list (from a Nat. Geo article back in the ‘60’s) of crossing the Kennebec.   Plus, everyone I met while walking to the Stirling Inn told me the story of Benedict Arnold…who got promoted after he lead a disastrous march on Canada.

July 17 & 18th:  Two nights in Monson for R&R before the dreaded 100 mile wilderness.

July 20th:  I watched a beaver swim in the pond from which I just got water.  
July 21st:  broke one of my Cascade Tech hiking poles while descending yet another rock face,

July 22nd:  a nice camp

July 23rd:  another nice camp and the trail was actually level enough to be fast.

July 24th:  a camp near Rainbow Lakes camp.

July 25th:  Abol Bridge.  A clean up and resupply.

July 26th:  final camp at The Birches:  Many happy hikers.

July 27th:  topped out on Mt. K.  Came down the south side with PopTart who was then flip flopping to Harper’s Ferry to complete the remaining 47% (he is an engineer). Of the AT.  This section will wait until next year for this hiker,","Pinkham Notch
