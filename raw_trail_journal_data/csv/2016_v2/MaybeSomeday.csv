MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524689,"It's been a little over a week since I left work and I have another week and a half before I head to Georgia. I've got my pack sorted out with about 4 days of food prepared. Pack is weighing in at about 27 lbs with food and water. Not ultra light but not too bad either. I decided not to take camp shoes. Having a hard time justifying the extra weight. Can always pick something up along the way if I need to.Will be spending these remaining days with the family. My grandson wants me to take him to Lemon Squeezer in Harriman so I might do that next week.Anyway, I'm excited and a little nervous and looking forward to getting started.","

MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525190,One week to go before I head out. Going through my gear and trying to cut some weight. Still under 30lbs with 4 days of food and a liter of water so I think I'm in decent shape but I'm sure I'll be sending some stuff home once I get started.This weekend I'll throw a bon voyage get together with the family. Hard to believe it's really happening.,"

MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527560,"Couldn't ask for a nicer day to start the trail. Pretty intense wind storm last night at Springer. In the morning I saw a tree had fallen not far from the tent site. Feel pretty good and happy to get started. On the flight down to Atlanta, I calculated roughly that every minute and a half of flying south equals about a day of walking north. ??","Springer Mountain

MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531724,"I've been back on the trail for about a week since I left Gattlinburg were I spent a few days waiting for my ankle to heal. I hiked out of the Smokys a couple of days ago and am now taking a day off in Hotsprings NC. Ankle has been getting progressively stronger although I'm still being very careful and taking it slow. That said, I did a 20 mile day on Wed and felt pretty good. It's been raining a lot and trail conditions are wet and muddy. Yesterday morning I woke up to find ice around my tent and it actually snowed a little on my way down to Hotsprings. Had a good rest here and looking forward to heading back out tomorrow. Hopefully, we'll get some warmer weather and sun.","Hotsprings NC

MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527589,Been hiking for a week now. I feel pretty good with no major issues. Landscape has been beautiful. I have one more day of hiking left in Georgia. Decided to take my first day off here in Hiawassee after having hiked about 67 miles. Looking forward to North Carolina.,"Dicks Creek Gap

MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528577,Been on the trail for 2 weeks now and have covered about 140 miles. I crossed into North Carolina on the 12th. Weather so far has been great. Mostly sunny and hot during the day. Need to watch for sun burn. Started feeling some pain in my left knee coming down the mountain into NOC today so I decided to do a short day. Will ice it tonight and see how it feels tomorrow. If I have to I'll take an unplanned zero if the knee is still questionable. All in all its been an amazing 2 weeks. I'm starting to feel comfortable in the woods and more confident about my hiking. Should be in the Smokies in a couple of days. Thanks to everyone for all their support. It really helps.,"NOC

MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530469,"So it's been a while since my last update. I've been making my way through the Smokys and am at about mile 207. Hiking in the Smokys has bee beautiful. Unfortunately, last Monday I was about 1.5 miles from finishing my hike for the day when i came down in my right ankle and sprained it pretty badly. This has forced me to take a few days off in town icing and resting my ankle. I've been in Gatlinburg TN for 4 days now. I'm planning to head back in the trail tomorrow and start hiking some low mileage days. I'll take it real easy until I'm sure my ankle is healed. Despite this setback, I'm still super excited about this trip and trying to just go with the flow. It reminds me of the conversation I had with the guy that shuttled me to the beginning of the trail on that first day. I told him that I had an itinerary worked out in a spreadsheet with daily mileage goals. He laughed and said I could always use it as toilette paper. The trail doesn't care about plans so stay flexible and don't stress the plan. Good advice.

MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531780,I spent the day resting in Hotsprings NC after a very wet week of hiking. Last Wed morning I woke to find ice around my tent and it actually snowed a little as I was hiking into town. My ankle has been getting stronger and I was able to hike my first 20 mile day which is encouraging. I've already met a few people dropping out due to injury so I count myself lucky. Getting ready to head back to the trail this morning and hoping for drier weather. I've managed to pick up a trail name this past week- MaybeSomeday. I kind of like it.,"Hotsprings

MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534506,"Have hit some big milestones in the past couple of weeks. I've crossed into Virginia, passed the 400 mile mark (at mile 468), wore out my first pair of shoes and developed a case of shin splints. That last milestone wasn't planned?? I've been in Damascus for the past 2 days and have been resting up and stuffing myself. I decided to pass on trail days since it meant shuttling north a 100 miles from Erwin which didn't make a lot of sense. As usual it's been very wet. It's been a while since we've had a dry, warm and sunny day. Forecast for the coming week looks promising. I'm excited that I'll be meeting Lule in Marion next Friday. The terrain has been flattening out and I've been able to put in longer miles which feels good. Getting to know more people on the trail and a fair number of people I knew have already dropped out. Still very happy to be here and enjoying the process.","Damascus

MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537591,"I've been really lazy about updating the journal lately. It's partly due to the effort of writing entries from my iPhone and having really poor wifi connections in town. Anyway, enough excuses. I spent Memorial Day weekend in Marion VA with Lule. We hadn't seen eachother for 2 months. It was great. We did an 11 mile hike on Sat and it was a beautiful sunny day. We got to visit an old schoolhouse along the trail and Lule got to see most of the people I'd been hiking with since we were hiking south while they were going north. We spent the rest of the weekend hanging around downtown Marion and taking in the Memorial Day festivities which included a car show and a sort of block party. A real small town America experience. It was tough saying goodbye but the weekend with Lule was definitely what I needed. Hiking out of Marion I had a week were it rained almost everyday. I got caught in a downpour just a mile from the shelter and and was so wet I had to ring out my socks and shirt before continuing. Sometimes you think you'll never be dry again but the sun eventually comes out and you dry up. - MaybeSomeday","

MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537593,"Currently at mile 685. Had some really nice days of hiking and the weather has been great although it is getting quite hot. Unfortunately, I had to get off the trail for a couple of days to take care of an infection that developed on my finger. I had to call a shuttle that took me to the medical clinic in Daleville were they numbed my finger and drained the infection. I'm now taking antibiotics and plan to get back on the trail tomorrow morning. I have some really nice views coming up this week including Dragons Tooth and MaCafee Knob. Also, my hermano Larry will be joining me on Wednesday for a few days of hiking. Should be a lot of fun. I'm planning to send my cold weather sleeping bag and cloths home in a couple of weeks when I reach Wynesboro. I ordered a lighter bag from REI as well as lighter hiking pants. I'm also planning to a smaller and lighter pack. I've been looking at the Exos 48 which would be 2 pound lighter than my Atmos. I'm thinking that with my lighter base weight I won't need the extra support of the Atmos. So with the lighter pack, bag and cloths I should be shedding about 4 pounds which is significant. At this point I'm starting to think about making up some time since at my current pace i'm tracking to finish around the end of Sept. with little contingency for any other issues that could further delay me. I may consider a flip flop and start hiking south from Maine if I see that I'm not going to make it to Katadin before Oct.","Dalesville

MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539594,"I met my brother on the trail last week and we spent 4 days hiking together. In those 4 days we had a full cycle of the AT experience. First day was hot and humid and we were sweating buckets. We had a wind and lightning storm while tenting on a ridge, hiked a day through the pouring rain and had an amazing day with sun and blue skies. We also spent some time in Buena Vista where we stayed in a seedy motel and stuffed ourselves with pasta. I had a great time and really enjoyed it. I'm now entering SNP and currently at mile 875. I've swapped out some gear including a lighter pack and sleeping bag. I also picked up a new pair of shoes. Trying a new shoe called Garmont. They're a little heavier than my Merills but hopefully will give a little more support. It's always scary to make gear changes but I think these changes will make my life easier. We'll see.","

MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543540,"It's been quite some time since I've updated my journal. Since my last update I completed Virginia, West Virginia Maryland and PA. Last Thursday i walked across the Delaware Water Gap and into NJ. I had a chance to spend 3 days at home and attend my grandson Oliver's birthday party. It was great seeing everyone after more than 3.5 months. Hiking through the summer has been a challenge with the heat, insects and dried up water sources. Each section of this journey has its own unique set of challenges. In PA it was hiking day after day on rocks and lack of water sources. The rocks really do a job on your feet. I was happy to finish up with PA. There were also sections in PA that were beautiful but I'm happy to be moving on to less rocky terrain and give my feet a chance to heal. I've decided to skip NJ and jump ahead to NY so that I make it up north a bit earlier in the season and hopefully better weather in the Whites and in Maine. Once I finish up north I'll make up the NJ section. All in all I'm doing well and feeling strong. Spending some time with the family these past 3 days really helped. I'm now at the point were I've switched from counting how many miles I've done to how many miles I have left to go which is about 800 miles.","

MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546535,"Since my last update quite a bit has happened both on and off the trail. After crossing into NJ and spending a few days at home, I got back on the trail and hiked through NY and into CT. I was really struggling to do my mileage feeling really fatigued which seemed pretty normal given the heat and humidity. I got up to Cornwall CT and started feeling feverish and chills so I decided to get a room in a motel and rest up. The next day I decided to go to the emergency room at a nearby town to get checked out and it turns out I had contracted Lyme disease and was put on antibiotics for 3 weeks. I wound up spending 3 days in the motel and then another 4 days at home until I felt strong enough to get back on the trail. After my rest at home I returned to Cornwall CT and have been slowly getting stronger and progressing north. I'm back to being able to do my 16 miles/day and I'm currently making my way through VT at mile 1650. It's been tough going these last few weeks and I started to doubt whether I could continue but I now am optimistic that I'll be able to complete this journey. I'm back in the mountains and the views are spectacular again. I'm now hoping I can finish up by end of Sept or early Oct.","manchester vt

MaybeSomeday,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549618,"Well my hike has completed and this will be my final update. Since my last post, I hiked up to Hanover NH and was feeling pretty good for a while but I came down with a sever stomach problem around the end of August. Unfortunately, I lost quite a bit of weight and I was was forced off the trail again for a couple of weeks. While off the trail, I considered my options and realized that I probably won't be able to complete the entire 2,189 miles given my physical state and the amount of time I was off the trail. I also realized that I wasn't ready to end my hike yet so I decided to fly to Maine and pick up the trail again at Monson which is the beginning of the 100 mile wilderness. I started hiking north again on Sept 11 and I'm so glad I was able to get back on the trail and enjoy this last section. Hiking through Maine was amazing and I started feeling strong again. I summit-ed Katahdin on Sept 20 and made the decision that I'll section hike NH some other time. So although I didn't complete the entire trail I did have an amazing experience hiking 1800 miles through 12 states and spending 6 months on the AT. It will take me time to absorb and reflect on everything that's transpired since starting this journey back in April. At this point, I can't feel anything but grateful and happy for having gone through this adventure. I would like to thank everyone who has supported and encouraged me through this process especially my wife and family. You have no idea how much it's meant to me.I would also like to thank all those trail angels I met along the way. So many amazing and generous people that go out of their way to help and make you feel welcome when you're so far away from home. I'll always remember their kindness.Well, ""Maybe Someday"" is signing off (at least for a while).","
