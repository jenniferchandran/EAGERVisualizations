Jess & Jeremy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539195,We have finally gotten an official close date for our house. We will be free and clear of it on Friday June 24th. This means that we can start our through hike attempt on Saturday the 25th! I never thought this day would come. There is still a lot to get done so now we just need to focus on the final details of our trip. -Jeremy,,View Entry,"Jun 22, Wed",0
Jess & Jeremy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539332,"Many people have asked us when we decided to commit to hiking the Appalachian Trail, so we wanted to share about our journey toward this goal. I first became aware of the trail approximately 10 years ago when I read ""A Walk in the Woods"" by Bill Bryson. I loved being outdoors, but at that point had never been camping, so the idea of hiking the trail was unfathomable to me. I met my husband Jeremy 5 years ago, and he took me on my first camping trip. From that first trip, I was hooked. Last year in May, we completed a short section hike between Caledonia State Park and Pine Grove Furnace State Park, and we really enjoyed the experience. (For anyone interested in a short hike to feel out your physical and emotional constitution toward completing the AT, this was perfect. The section is 20 miles long, and there's a shelter at the mid point. Start in Caledonia and finish in Pine Grove Furnace. We took two cars, parked one at each end, and hiked from one to the other. The two parks are only 12 miles driving distance from one another.) Then in July, we visited Shenandoah National Park and hiked a short section of the trail. On our way down from one of the vistas, Jeremy posed the question, ""What would we have to do to be able to hike the whole trail?"". We hashed out a plan, and from that point on, our life revolved around being able to accomplish this goal. We put our house on the market, sold several rooms worth of unnecessary furniture on Craig's List, donated an uncanny amount of clothing, books, and household goods to local community associations, and held two yard sales. Throughout the year we limited our spending, putting as much money in savings as physically possible. At the end of April, we got an offer on our house, and the dream started to become reality. The week before Memorial Day we both gave our employers notice that we would be leaving our companies. In Jeremy's last post, he laments ""I never thought this day would come"", and that statement couldn't be more real to us both. Our efforts to simplify our lives and prepare for our journey have finally come to fruition. We are so excited for this journey, and we can't wait to share our experiences with you!Thanks for reading!Jess",,View Entry,"Jun 23, Thu",0

Jess & Jeremy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539664,"Today was our first day on the trail. It was very rocky as is all of PA we hear. We saw a deer. We also heard a tree fall while we were laying in our tent. Met two nice guys, Puma and Robo. Today wasn't too bad but tomorrow we are going to shoot for Boiling Springs 12 miles away.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

Jess & Jeremy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539784,"Today was tough. We started out strong at 7am and the first few miles were reasonably flat. And then we came to the up and downs, 6 in total. At the top of two of them we had to weave and rock climb to get through the boulders. Met a turtle and a baby bunny along the way. How did they get up there? Around the 7th mile we were exhausted and out of energy but had 5 more miles to go to get to boiling Springs, PA. Puma and Robo, from yesterday, caught up to us and gave us a little pep talk. ""Embrace the suck and don't be a pussy"". Words to live by on this journey. To celebrate my birthday Jeremy booked us at the local B & B. To get there we had to walk through this endless corn field during the hottest part of the day. We missed a sign and walked a mile out of our way (which means 2 miles with backtracking) but we finally made it to town. Our feet our killing us. Thank goodness we're done for the day.","James Fry shelter

Jess & Jeremy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539845,"Due to chafing, blisters, and shoulder pain we opted to stay in town another day. Jeremy was carrying his pack weight on his shoulders so we made some adjustments so he will carry the weight on his hips and chest. For the blisters we got padded bandaids. For the chafing we got gold bond powder and friction defense balm. Tomorrow we will head out with 3 days worth of foodays (pictured), and walk 14 miles to the Darlington shelter. Although the miles are ambitious, the hike is flat most the way. Tonight we will enjoy a shower, air conditioning, and a visit to the Boiling Springs Tavern (est. 1832).","Boiling Springs, PA

Jess & Jeremy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540048,"We started our hike from Boiling Springs before 7am. The trail was mostly flat alternating between wooded areas, corn and wheat fields. At about 5 miles we came across a family cemetery with grave stones dating back to the 1700's. We also met slow poke and hot rod, twin brothers through hiking from Georgia. Around the 8 mile mark we were feeling pretty strong but it got much hotter and harder from there. During the last mile of our hike today we got stuck in a thunderstorm. The trees provided a sporadic umbrella, but the last mile was an 800 foot assent. When we got to the shelter there were many others, but they quickly packed up and headed back out on the trail once the weather cleared. We figured out the shoulder issue on Jeremy'said pack, but it caused a hip issue. He also acquired another blister. Tomorrow we have a 7 mile hike to the next shelter.","Boiling Springs, PA

Jess & Jeremy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540419,"After 50 miles we have made the decision to discontinue our hike. Thru hiking isn't for everyone, and there is a good reason only 27% of thru hiking attempts succeed. There is an extreme difference between hiking/camping and backpacking. We have decided to travel across the country to visit as many national parks as we can before we run out of money or time. No matter how much you prepare for a journey like this, you can never truly know what it will be like until you're out in the woods living it. For anyone thinking about taking a journey like this in the future, we would advise attempting several section hikes before committing to a thru hike. Make sure your pack fits as comfortably as possible, and don't choose perfect weather, because you will certainly not have perfect weather for 6 months straight. Don't compare your pace to the paces of other hikers. If you're not enjoying yourself, it's not worth the misery, heart break, and torture your body has to endure. We would like to thank everyone who supported us. Please feel free to follow our new journey across the country.","Elkton, MD
