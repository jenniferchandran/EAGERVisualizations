Roundabout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/466542,"Like many of you, I've thought about a thru hike on and off over my 57 years but the possibility never materialized until a few months ago. Life circumstances (work, an incredibly supportive wife, timing) look like they will permit me the opportunity to fulfill this goal. Let the planning (and fun) begin....",,The Opening,"Jul 17, Thu",0
Roundabout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/466543,"I know it seems a long way off, and i worry that events in the interim months may screw with the dream, but I'll be optimistic that one way or another, I'll be at Springer sometime in March 2016. I hope in the months ahead to learn about other members of the ""Class of 2016"" who will also be through hiking during that time.",,Class of 2016,"Jul 17, Thu",0
Roundabout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/466544,"So as to complete my initial three entries to qualify for being included on the AT Journal's public domain, I am noting below my initial pre-gear list: an AT 2015 calendar, an AT National Geo Map for the wall so i can stare at it (for motivation) over the next year, my recently renewed REI membership card, and my order for at least three different e-books on hiking the AT.Also, drove up to Bear Mountain bridge last week while visiting in NY just to see a bit of the trail and catch maybe a hiker...didn't see any but it was a beautiful area. Looking forward to being back there in summer 2016!",,Pre-Gearing Up,"Jul 17, Thu",0
Roundabout,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/467656,Reading (and learning) from the amazing Class of 2014 as they head into Northern New England. Really inspiring and motivating. Also keeping in mind the impact two widely-released Movies taking place on the AT (to be released in 2015) will have on traffic for the 2016 Class. More the merrier I guess...My maps from ATC have arrived; will frame them and hang them in room as a positive reminder of good times to come.--- R,,Watching Class of 2014,"Jul 26, Sat",0
