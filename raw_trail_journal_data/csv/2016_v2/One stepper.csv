One stepper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520016,"While planning my 2016 AT Northbound Thru Hike by wasting time wandering around the net I found this journal service.   I've not been a journal keeper nor one inclined to write down and share my personal thoughts so publically, but this online journal appears to have features that may ease and help organize the task, and personal desire, of documenting my trip.So, I'm playing around with it by reading others' journals while considering and sifting through their advice, trials and tribulations for nuggets that either resonate with my own thoughts or challenge me to reconsider my somewhat entrenched thinking.Excuse my ramblings while I just plod along, one step at a time.",,View Entry,"Jan 20, Wed",0
One stepper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521791,"In hindsight and with some measure of guilt, I've probably have spent more time reading, talking, and thinking about getting in shape for my hike than actually working at it. I've taken some comfort from the advice most frequently shelled out: ""Nothing prepares you better than actually doing it, so just start slow and work up to your potential gradually when starting your hike.""Still, I've managed to get to the point now where carrying a fully loaded pack ten miles or so, with 2000' ft of elevation gain, is not a totally draining experience nor a full day outing, The phrase, ten by ten, has been been my mantra all this winter and the measuring stick for my daily exercise be it skate or downhill skiing (with lots of traversing hikes to get the shots), trail running or hiking with my dog, Of these, my favorites have been my predawn hikes to Snowbird's Hidden Peak to catch the sunrise, runs down untouched chutes, and skate sking with Izzie, the dog, at Round Valley. Sunrises at 11,000 ft and flapping Labrador ears by your side while skating along at a pace significantly faster than running are truly great moments.   Obviously, the gym has taken a backseat to these activities, serving mostly as the post workout steam and tub recovery zone. However, I have managed to get on the stair master a few times...so boring.So now, I'm thinking about increasing my fat stores just before my hike, like the squirrel before winter, knowing that my hike food prep will totally miss the mark.",,View Entry,"Feb 21, Sun",0
One stepper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521873,"Listening last night to Jim Harris speak about his adventures and his recovery from a spinal injury, recalling Anish's musings on her record setting hikes, and remembering my family's and my own challenges, among other antidotes and stories, has been prompting me to take a hard look at what it will take, mindfully, to accomplish an AT thru hike.A women in the audience last night asked Jim about his resiliency in the faces of seemingly insurmountable tasks, basically whether it had always been in his nature or that circumstances nurtured and developed this trait. He replied that it had been developed and tested during his adventures, and he was now applying these lessons to his recovery.Parallel to Jim, Heather's planning and singlemindness on her AT hike, stripping away distraction and much of the noise that often accompanies record setting or extreme rigorous adventures, I'm convinced, helps pave the way to success. By approaching the goal, or as Jim phrased it, ""parsing,"" the larger task into ""one step at a time."" thereby reducing the enormity and complexity of any seemingly insurmountable or daunting task largely contributes to a successful outcome.Both sides of my family are immigrants to the US. They were not wealthy when they came here, but both were acting on the hope of better lives for themselves and their families. Both saw economic advantage, while one was escaping socio-political oppression. Combined, these reasons prompted them to seek opportunities, despite the obstacles hey encountered, both expected and unanticipated, that laid before them. Fortunately they were both succesfulI, as evidenced by my presence on this earth....Do I have that ""hutzpah"" in me? Have my prior experiences, like moving out West, leading a few river trips, and a few short term backpacking trips demonstrated that I have the mettle for such a task as this? Looking back at my prior experiences, the successes as well as the setbacks encountered along the way, give me some comfort that I may be equal to the task, but not entirely prepared for it. And I need to be ok with that, trusting that I have the ability to adapt and adjust to all the demands that this task will set before me. I just need to remember, in the face of every new challenge, it will be my ability to adopt to changing, and challenging, circumstances with the resiliency and focus that, at my best moments, have shown before.",,View Entry,"Feb 24, Wed",0
One stepper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522754,"DistractionsIn twenty three days, on March 28th, I’ll land in Atlanta, be picked up and transported by Josh to the Hiker Hostel. The next day I’ll set foot on the trail. I have been trying to shed the day to day pulse of distractions at home and the tempting and pleasurable experiences that others dangle before me. Its hard to say no, when you know that these wont be options in a few weeks.Like the inflexibility of an approaching permitted launch date, the shrinking number of days left to prepare for a hard deadline has prompted the familiar frenzy of an endless cycle of checking, rechecking, adding, subtracting, and then reconsidering past choices,   This cycle never seems to end until you start, even with prior experience, but only becomes more harried and taxing as the date looms.I have been both comforted and guided significantly by two several bits of advice I’ve recently picked up: 1) “You pack for your fears” 2) “You will take more than you need, but you can see what does and does not work for you” 3) “Try to keep your pack weight, minus food and water, under fifteen pounds” 4) “Keep your daily food pack between one and a half and two pounds per day”My pack weight continues to edge up as I add items in anticipation of cold and wet weather. The food pack gains weight as I seek variety and increased caloric intake. My water carrying capacity and it’s weight penalty edges up as my concern for its scarcity grows. And then there’s all those “comfort” items. I’m sure ill be finagling with the pack’s contents to the very day that I ship it off to the HIker Hostel.In contrast to provisioning gear and food, I feel pretty good about my body and mind’s prep for the hike. I’ve managed to stay healthy and injury free while playing and training this winter, except for a nagging sore shoulder from pancaking on a flat light masked cat track a couple of weeks ago. I have worked my way up to the point that I’m confident ing in my ability to carry a full load “Ten miles by 10:00 AM’ in “PUD” conditions and still have enough gas in the tank to continue the same pace for another ten miles.   As it been in the past, my biggest concern here will be missing and reminiscing about the very distractions that I am currently trying to shut out, all those comforts and roles that I fill. I’m pretty sure and concerned that my absence will unfairly disrupt and burden others.Still, time marches on.",,View Entry,"Mar 06, Sun",0

The hour soon approaches.Also I have, despite pundits' cautions and my own weight reservations, added a couple of ""luxury items"" that others have suggested.One, I took an old paperback copy of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance that I'd kept on my shelf for sentimental reason since the Seventies and tore it up into manageable chunks to be mailed with my resupplies. It will be my only nondigital reading companion other than my AWOL and map that I'll carry.Second, I'm going to wear a Nyami Nyami pendant that a favorite student teacher of mine gave me on her return from the Zambezi River.. Based on a mythic Zambezi River serpent, the charm is believed to protect the Tonga people and give them sustenance in difficult times.

I was soon passed by Ed, given his mecurial pace. The rain started to fall in earnest, so I donned some gear, which despite all the fabric technology still creates a greenhouse effect under its protective shell. Experienced my first trail magic at Woody Gap. I was met with a cup of tea, a tasty bar, and the offer of soup by several folks who shared this bus and a ""lifestyle"" that reminded me of the community up on Beaver Meadow. This mobile commune, I heard later, had already prompted one thru hiker to quit and join them. I, however, just enjoyed the warm tea though and pushed on.I arrived at Lance creek,my planned destination, but opted to push on to Neels on the promise of a hot shower and a dry bunk after the discomfort of blood mtn. 
Made a beeline for the first shelter on blood as it began to rain heavily and waited out the brunt of it with Ron Paul and Smash. When it lightened up I climbed the rocky steps to Blood's old school shelter and then dropped the falls to Neels, arriving at dusk, happy for the comforts the hostel had to offer.

Second to arrive with only a few others later on. The permit that took me a good hour at the lodge to figure out and print has some pretty odd, yet specific rules for thru hikers. Basically requiring us to stay in the shelter unless it's full of other permitted non-thru hikers. If that's the case, then the last thru hikers in are kicked out and must tent near the shelter and give the shelter space to permitted non thru hikers. It would suck to roll in late, get kicked out by a later arriving permitted person, and have to sent up your tent in the dark. So the strategy while in the park seems to be...arrive early.","Fontana

Also set about taking care of my feet, not blisters, but heel pain and an Achilles' tendon pull resulting from catching my foot under a tripwire root and falling forward. Ouch. After replacing my insoles with Superfeet, I went and soaked my feet in the town creek. While there I started smelling whiffs of smoke and the once clear morning sky was developing the haze that's usually associated with a distant forest fire. Easterly winds picked up and the day warmed the fire rapidly and it progressed and outpaced the communities' response to it. It wasn't till late afternoon, after the fire had gained the ridge, jumped the road, and was marching quickly towards town that the response started to include helicopter bucket drops and, later still, airplane fire retardant drops. All this resulted in the trail being closed and everyone stuck in town. Zero day.

It was nice to start early though, with low humidity, cool temp, and early morning birdsong. I eventually put my earbuds in to listen to tunes, but wasn't getting sound out of one bid. At first I thought it was that it was an iPod or headphone issue, so ignored it and just listened out of one ear. But when the kids started passing me midday on my right and saying hi, I noticed that it sounded weird and echoey. So I played around with my buds again and discovered that I had no hearing out of my right ear! Can't describe how stressed out this made me, worrying that I had ruptured my eardrum or something..., but knowing I still had one night out before I could get in town to start trying to deal with it. I was able to call Sue and Sheena about it, which provided a measure of comfort, that, along with not having any pain, provided some comfort, but still....it's weird and disconcerting not to be able hear and run possibilities thru your head. Made it to an empty eagles nest shelter, which many youngsters were skipping and putting in a bigger day to get to Port Clinton, a goal beyond me. I was eventually joined by Silver Streak and a few others who hammocks and tented nearby as it was the best water source around. A nice weather day and night. Downright cool in the evening.","501 shelter

Decided to bail on more miles today and chose to share a room with Silver Streak and see about heading to Sheena and Cj's a day early to get help with my ear.

Hence, the remaining 700 miles will have to wait till next year or later since I'm unsure how long it will take to get my feet back to 100%.
I wanted to again thank all the folks that helped get me the 1400 or so miles that I did end up walking. I would not had made it that far without your support, hospitality, and encouragement. The shared miles with fellow trail hikers and both the chance and planned moments with friends, family, and new acquaintances all sustained and propelled my steps along the trail. So grateful for this, especially given the narcissistic nature of a solo thru hike. I hope to continue my small and meager attempts at ""trail magic"" while on my hike to sustain and perpetuate the hospitality that I was so fortunate to receive along the way.
