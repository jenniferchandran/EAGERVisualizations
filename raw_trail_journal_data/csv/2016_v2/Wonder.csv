Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522883,"Amazing how much time and energy goes in to securing my water sources. Although water is plentiful, I plan to carry 2 to 3 liters at a time. If it's not readily visible, I have an app on my phone that helps me locate sources. Preferably, the water should be moving , not standing. I filter the water into a plastic wide mouth bottle (the wide mouth makes it easier to get the water in without it touching the rim), then add water treatment drops to clean the water. It needs to dwell 30 minutes. Then I transfer amazingly clean water into my drinking bottles. Wondering--if I'll ever take water faucets for granted again!","

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523017,"Tackled Blood Mountain today, the highest peak in Georgia. Ascent was slow and very steep. The descent was almost harder. Took me almost 3 hours to go 2 miles. Unhappy to see a tree at the end of the descent that is full of hiker's boots that quit at this point. Seems to be a tradition to throw your boots up over it when quitting. Although my emotions have swung between exhilaration (it is incredibly beautiful out here) and absolutely hating this, I am not at the point of launching the boots. Progress has been slow. I've expected to walk faster but terrain is difficult and I haven't found my ""hiking legs"" yet. The seasoned hikers say its coming. The other piece of advice they've given- its not unusual to NOT be hungry. I am not hungry and have hard time eating the food in my pack. I am told this will pass too, and I will suddenly be famished. However, there were good hearted people at the bottom of Blood Mountain cooking free cheeseburgers for the hikers- which tasted great (I can always find room for a cheeseburger!) Ate it with a big glass of cold milk. Revitalizing. The other hikers are amazing. Everyone so nice, willing to help. Met a 19 year old, trail name ""Soup"". Wants to hike the entire way with me but am sure he'll end up moving a bit faster than me. One major disappointment is the the 2 full capacity phone chargers I brought.   One had no charge at all. The second only brought my failing cell phone battery back to 26%. So I need to conserve until I am in a town to recharge. Expecting to be in Kiawasee in a few days and will stay in my first hotel. Heading to a campsite for the night 1 mile up trail for today. Will upload pictures in Kiawasee.","

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523433,"Mile 70, seven days out: The hiking is incredibly hard. I'm either going up or down, never level. It is exhausting and challenging-physically, mentally, emotionally. But I am learning to plan for it. My appetite is improving but the food tastes bad. But I need to be conscious to take in calories and stay hydrated at a steady pace or I absolutely will not have the energy to make it up the next incline. Don't have my hiking legs yet but they're getting stronger. I set out early in the morning and generally walk until 2:30 or 3:00 in the afternoon. The sun starts going down around 4:30 and I want my camp settled before dark. After a day of hiking, setting up camp is an effort. In fact, taking off my pack for any reason can be an effort and I have to decide, Do I really need that? Sometimes its just wasted energy. I'm sleeping soundly but nighttime is hard: so dark, strange noises, little eyes shining back at me from my headlamp. The worse nights were the first ones. It's better now. I've been sleeping in my tent, which most hikers do. The shelters are dirty, full of mice. People talk of the Noro-virus in there so they stay away. The weather has been good, but we did have a storm last night and I broke camp this morning in the rain. I had my ""shake down"" several days back. That's where this guy looks through your pack and helps you lighten it. I mailed 6-7 pounds of gear back home. I've made it to my first town, Hiawasee, GA, where I'll be sleeping in a hotel for a night or 2. I've had my first real shower in 7 days. Heaven. Coming off the trail today at Dick's Creek, I was greeted with a little more ""Trail Magic"". Those are the amazing people that hand out free food to hikers. I had a warm breakfast burrito courtesy of this guy who camps there for days to feed and water us hikers. Wonderful gift. Some Trail Magic saved me a few days back from the only time I was cold out here so far. Hot chocolate and a Snickers bar set me right. Great fellow travelers. Although I tend to walk alone, I have been leapfrogging with Wanderdog, a 59 year old guy who puts in a solid 7miles/day, then camps. He'll pass me, then I him, and back and forth with conversation in the passing. I've camped near a group of 3 people several nights and appreciated their campfires. There's Pat, Nick and Sarah (with her beautiful dog, Jetta). Pat had a blister so bad on his heel that he wore his Crocs instead of hiking boots for 3 days and said that his feet were better in the Crocs. He said he may contact the company to promote it.   I've got blisters on both of my second great toes under the nails-think I may lose my nails. On the bright side. It's beautiful here. I'm often looking down watching my footing, then will glance up and the sight takes my breath away. At night, the stars are so close I could pick them out of the sky. Tomorrow is a Zero Day (not walking), then back to the Trail on Tuesday. Only 8 miles left in Georgia. We'll see what North Carolina can do to me! Wondering- Should I shave? Haven't yet....","

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523941,"Since last I wrote, I have crossed in to North Carolina and am on mile 110. I'm beginning to feel that my legs are getting stronger, and even though I'm still exhausted after a day of hiking, the stamina is improving. Yesterday, I was able to do 14 miles despite the fact that the early part of the day included a hike up Mount Albert. (There is an uploaded picture taken near a fire tower atop this mountain.) The south face ascent was quite steep. I climbed 700 feet of altitude in about 1/4 mile. At times, I needed to actually use my hands to help with the progress. I was concerned about heading down this mountain since steep descents with a heavy pack can be dangerous. I was relieved to learn that the north face was a more gradual descent.   Along the way I walked at intervals with 3 other hikers that all have Wisconsin roots, all men about my age. They're from the Greendale and Whitefish Bay areas. One of them mentioned another hiker up the trail, a younger women that is from Stevens Point. It made the world feel a little smaller anyway.     My second largest toe on both feet continue to be an issue. In town today, a worker at the outfitters told me I should probably upsize my hiking boots.   He's pretty sure I'll be losing the nails. But despite these toes, I really have no other issues and my feet seem to be in better shape than some of the other hikers I see who struggle to walk sometimes. I think I'll get some more wear out of these boots if possible, then upsize my next pair. It's a hard decision. I don't want to trade cramped toes for blisters that develop from boots that are too big.     I am staying in town tonight, in Franklin, NC, then back to the trail early tomorrow. I'll be heading to Nantahala for a mail drop and resupply, 27 miles up trail. Looks like I'll be walking through some rain in the coming days- its unavoidable. I've had pretty good weather so far but did get caught in a hailstorm a few day back. Luckily, I was near a shelter and avoided being exposed for the worst of it.    I continue to be amazed at the landscapes and beauty out here. It's a little early yet, but they say Spring in these mountains is supposed to be something to see.","Franklin, NC

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524384,"Okay, so last night was cold. Started snowing later afternoon but I was able to set up my tent without snow beneath it. The tent and sleeping bag keep me warm, but heading into the bag at sunset means I'm getting up- at least at some point- very calculatingly- in the middle of the night for a bathroom break. This means I'm getting quite cold before I climb back in to warm myself. I seem to stay warm until 3 or 4 am, and then I get a little colder.   Not sure if my food stores are wearing off or what. But I do get chilly in these hours. Woke up this morning with my water stores partially frozen. Was in the 20s last night. Icy in the descent this morning, but it quickly faded as the sun warmed. I have decided that staying in a tent on nights like this is preferable to staying in a shelter, which was an option. I am enclosed in my tent-keeps the heat in.   Shelters have an open wall where the breeze flows. Liking my choice.    
Been traveling with a new group lately, making four of us. We're all staying tonight in a bunkhouse in the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center) which is quite the hikers paradise. This site boasts kayaking and white water events on the Nantahala River so its a community very friendly to hikers. Had dinner and my first trail beer with a few great hiker buddies whose company I appreciate. There's Walking Tall, whose retired from the state patrol and has been lucky enough to have his wife nearby to pick him up at times (though this will end in Gatlinburg) ; Portuguese, who is from Portugal. He's an appreciated writer in his country who writes about hiking and plans to write a book about the Appalachian Trail. And Feral, an Iowan, who has retired from a long term care facility as an Administrator.   Great companions one and all. I have also connected with Pat and Rachel again, who are nearby, as well as Judge Judy, another Wisconsinite. The bunkhouse sleeps four, with a shower-house nearby-so appreciated.   
I can't describe the daily emotional swings. Physically, its challenging. Mentally-far harder. Everything requires planning, choices matter greatly. Always watching the sun. I tend to walk from about 8:30 to 4:30. Make camp. Make sure I'm in dry clothes. String the bear line. Eat. Lift food. Climb in to bed. Fall asleep quickly. Awaken to pee (dare I venture away from tent in the dark? How cold will I get?). Back to bed. Awaken early. Breakfast goes like this: Boil water in my stove: make oatmeal-eat oatmeal- boil water for hot chocolate and drink with left-over oatmeal floaters- then boil water for tea and drink. This cleans my pot very well and keeps me from walking that 0.1 of a mile for water to clean the pot. Very efficient. TAKES PLANNING. Then break camp, walk. Resupply water. Repeat.... Now I know what I'll be doing with all my down time. Wink.    
Tomorrow is a choice. The next shelter is 7 miles away. But there are 5 miles between this spot and the shelter that are UPHILL--as in continual climbing. If I feel good, may venture to next campsite, which is 3.5 miles past. Will see...

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524631,"    Sheltered last night-3rd time now. Since Walking Tall took his dog Jack Daniels with him to sleep off the trail, it was my first shelter night without a canine to keep the mice away. They do respect the dogs- but it was okay.    Short day yesterday but hiked from 1000 feet to 4800 in 5 miles. Difficult but managed to go 7.5 total. So despite the distance, felt accomplished.      Honored to be part of a video honoring the birthday of Feral's son. Feral has never gone a year without a ""Fisher Price"" musical happy birthday celebration for his grown son's birthday. Since this year is a bit different, they both settled for a video rendition of happy birthday from his current trail buddies. Tears all around. Was a touching, happy event.      Heading to Fontana Dam at the foothills of the Smoky Mountains, 13 miles out. Should be there Thursday. Bought a ""thru-hiker"" pass for $20 dollars to hike in these mountains. The protocol for the Smokies is to stay in a shelter, but there are not enough spots to go around, so the fee is to be able to tent if no shelter is available. Will happily comply.....I like tenting anyway.      For those interested in the ""threatening"" wildlife out here. I have seen no bear, no wild pigs and no mountain lions. Not saying they're not here, just haven't seen them. I have seen bear poop and claw marks in rotted stumps--but the only threatening wild life so far has been a garter snake sunbathing on a rock in the sunlight. I do hear owls and coyotes.- which I appreciate. So I have had no opportunity to use the gun I did NOT bring. But I do know this is their world.       Wondering-if the wildlife is content with us living amongst them?-Hoping....","

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525086,"Mile 195-    Cell service returned today, likely temporarily. Very spotty here in the Smokies.    Never been one to have my mood dampened by the weather-but I've never walked the AT before. Reached Fontana Dam last Friday. It was great weather prior, and I was appreciating the early spring buds. But the last few days have been very rainy and I have been wet much of the time. Decided to stop in a shelter today after walking 6 miles-a short day but needed to break. I am at the very top of a mountain with nothing much around me. The nice thing about the Smokies is the shelters have fireplaces, which will be much appreciated tonight. There'll be a full house here-given the weather. Here's the ""rainy"" reality: I walk with a rain coat, but am soaking wet beneath the coat from sweating. The lightweight smart-wool material (great stuff really) keeps me warm WHEN I'M MOVING. However, because going down these steep slopes requires me to slow down, especially in the slippery conditions, I am getting cold as the pace slows. I need to be very conscious to get these wet clothes off when I stop, and need to be careful to keep my sleeping clothes dry. This is not always easy. Hoping to see the sun tomorrow-dry out my clothes and gear, but that's not forecasted. It is difficult, never ending work just now. Trees with no leaves, leaves on the ground. Need some spring weather to lift the spirit.    I am becoming very comfortable with sheltering. I'm sleeping through the mice (amazing what you get used to). It amuses and amazes me how comfortable you get sleeping in a ""puppy pile"" with strangers. If there's even a hint of an open spot, you make room, male or female. Irrelevant. Everyone welcome. Everyone needs to rest.    There are no privies in the Smokies (had some prior-tend to avoid them anyway-they can be pretty gross). Here there are arrows pointing to a ""toilet"". As you approach the area, it is merely a location where bathroom breaks are expected-pick a tree- if you can find one unoccupied. Again, amazed at the lack of inhibition that comes of necessity here. Strips it away. Maslow's Hierarchy.       Should reach Clingman's Dome observation deck tomorrow, which is the highest point on the AT (elevation 6643 ft). It is right at the 200 mile point. Shortly after, I have the opportunity to trolley into Gatlinburg- at this point may pass on that. I am beginning to separate from the ""bubble"" that I have been moving along with- choosing different destinations to camp, different zero days. Traveling with a younger set currently.      My nephew Paul is out here somewhere hoping to find and connect with me. We had some contact before losing cell service and I gave him my location some time back. Continuing to move and hoping to run in to him. I familiar face would be wonderful and I would love it if he could find me.       Will add pictures when I can spare the battery uploading.      Wondering- Will I be living off Maslow's lower tiers for the entire walk?","Silers Bald Shelter

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526283,"Mile 275- After a week of cold, hard hiking, I am feeling relaxed and happy today in Hot Springs, NC. The last week has been physically and emotionally difficult, but I have managed-with a little help from my friends- to return to a steady mental state. It is amazing how vital that is out here. It is everything. The hardest part is the extraordinary physical discomfort, especially r/t feeling cold, wet- frequently both. The weather puts you on roller-coasters not unlike the walking grade I daily experience. I had a difficult time a few days back. Was contemplating heading into Gatlinburg and the thought of heading home from there was definitely simmering. My friend and walking companion, Portuguese, talked me through it. Here's how. I mentioned in a previous blog that Portuguese is a hiker and renowned writer in his home country of Portugal. Knowing I was feeling tentative, he kept me out of Gatlinburg and on the trail. He said he wanted me there atop Mount Katadin with him, to take his picture for the book he is writing about the AT. Said he would credit the photographer and I would be a hero in his country! God love him! Well, I couldn't pass that up. So Thank you, My friend. I may need to adopt a new country at some point and your country sounds very tempting. By the Way- Portuguese has hiked many trails in several countries and he definitively states the AT is the most challenging trail he has done to date. Picked a goody for my first!    Speaking of this being my first- I am a capable, but undeniably novice hiker. I've mentioned this before, but staying warm and dry is an art and a science that the veteran hikers do instinctively. For me it is effort and it is trial and error. Not everyday is cold or rainy, but the other day I battled snow again. I awoke to 1/2 inch of ice on my tent and hiking clothes wet from the day before. Despite the weather, I have to get up and get dressed in dampish clothes, layer up, pack up (this day included shaking the ice off my tent before packing it). As I walk, I need to strategically shed the outer clothes. The smart wool is great but dries best when on you and you're moving. So, sometimes wearing these clothes is the best way to dry them. A calculated decision depending on conditions. I do appreciate those experienced hikers who offer wisdom to me. Soak it up like a little kid. Thanks Veterans!    Yesterday was a great day. Finally met up with my nephew Paul and his girlfriend Kara. We missed last week but he tried again (appreciate the tenacity!) I managed to get him my coordinates (cell service very bad here) and they parked up trail and walked South until they found me. We walked together a good 9 miles where they headed to the car to drive to Hot Springs to meet me as I traveled the distance on foot. Arriving in Hot Springs, I had more welcome visitors. My sister-in-law and brother-in-law, Mickie and Jerry, were there to meet me. So wonderful to have familiar folks around. Spent a great evening with the 4 of them as well as my 2 trail buddies, Portuguese and Feral. Had a great dinner courtesy of Feral (thank you, Bud) and a great cottage waiting for me bought and paid for by Mic and Jer. Unexpected generosity. Refueled me for the coming journey. Thanks to all of you! My endearing gratitude.       Since this is a journal of thanks, I want to extend my appreciation to those sending me well wishes on my Guest Book. Your messages lift me more than I can say...      I have learned that my will to continue is inspiration from within. But the kindness of others has been so helpful and it does fuel that inspiration.   Wondering- Can this good will get me through the next challenges?   Sure to help....","Hot Springs, NC

It's been very cold, very snowy. Unusually cold actually.    Yesterday I walked in snow for the greater part of the day. Today, walked 5 miles and decided that when I crossed a road with a shuttle leading to town- I would take it. Why? temps projected in the teens tonight, with wind chills to -3.    I have warm clothes but....my Wisconsin sensibilities tell me its time to shelter and leave the miles to another day.    Here's the reality. I am heading toward Erwin, TN, where I am right now. Safe and warm in a hostel with 9 others. Showered, laundered and feeling clean earlier than expected but not exactly the plan. I have time tonight to catch the shuttle in town at 5:30, eat at one of 5 recommended restaurants (hot meals always welcome), restock at Walmart, catch a ride back with the shuttle by 7:30, and bunk down for a good nights rest. Thing is- Erwin is my walking destination for tomorrow. My ride to town was premature. So tomorrow it will take me back ten miles to where I left off. My plan is to walk those miles back here and stay one more night in this same shelter. Well, at least I have a reservation.    Worried somewhat for my good friends that have chosen to stay the night out there. Couldn't persuade them on the possibility of experiencing negative temps in a tent. Time will tell if this is a miscalculation on my part- Should I have toughed it out?

Grateful for their safety.      Stayed in Uncle Jerry's Hostel last night and intended to do the same tonight.. But sleep was very hard to come by courtesy of frequent trips to the bathroom by needy hikers accompanied by slamming doors. Understanding natures call, but nature also requires sleep for the weary. But get this. 14 years ago, the hostel was visited by its main resident that has become king of the castle. His name is Jerry Garcia-a very active canine that has figured out how to make this hostel his very own. Incoming-he pushes his way in. Outgoing- he's on hind legs opening the door. Something to see. But he's an insomniac and came and went at least 6 times last night and has no need to maintain the peace. Needless to stay, I am not staying in Uncle Jerry's tonight.

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528433,"A good week of hiking. Weather was still cold early in the week, but the last day of 20 degree weather was sometime back on Roan Mountain. It has improved to pleasant and even in the mornings I am finding that I am no longer shivering. It's amazing the difference that makes psychologically.     Spent most of the last few weeks weaving between the North Carolina and Tennessee boarder, but left North Carolina behind back on mile 394 and have been solidly in the Northeastern Corner of Tennessee. Should reach Damascus in approximately 3 days which is the first major stop in Virginia. Virginia is the longest state for the AT. So once in it, I will be there for about 600 miles.    Been walking very steadily with Portuguese and spent a few days with a really nice woman named B Hiker. She has moved on but we were once again joined by Feral, who took some time off to tend to a foot issue, but has since caught up to us. Glad for it.    Been often able to get cell service on the ""Balds"". These are the mountain top domes that have no trees, only grass. Beautiful 360 degree views from up here often gives an unobstructed signal. I tend to stop on these points, turn on the phone. If I have a signal, will call home to talk with my wife, my parents, my kids, a few friends. The voice contact, although minimal, is reassuring all around. Interesting how 100 feet in any direction will change the phone signal, you just never know. I stayed last night on top of a mountain. 4 miles from it, I had a signal so was really believing I would have one at the top. Was disappointed when I camped to find that the service was no longer there. You just can't predict it.       Staying away from hiker shelters tonight r/t an unsettling issue with bears the last night. It seems a hungry bear was trying to get the packs out of the tree (attached picture shows how I safely stow my food bag every night-a huge safety precaution). But unfortunately, a fellow hiker decided to keep a candy bar in his pants-- in his tent. The bear smelled it out, ripped through the tent with the sleeping hiker inside, and took the pants with the candy. Thankfully- the hiker was not in them at the time and he was untouched. A good reminder to all.     I did have a interaction with another sunning snake today- this one directly laying across the trail. Unfortunately it was in an area where veering off the trail to go around it was not an option. So- I had to move it. Although not experienced with snakes in general, I did't believe it was poisonous. It was not red and did not rattle, but it was definitely the biggest one I have ever seen. So I poked it gently with my walking stick to prod it along. When it decided to slither toward me, I had to poke it again and then it took off in another direction. Path clear once more for us to continue on our way.    Also walked near a forest fire yesterday which was likely the result of an unextinguished campfire. Although the fire didn't cross the trail (they were going to close it down if it did), we did walk through some smoke for a time.     I get so many question about if I ""like"" it out here.   There is such a range of feelings and circumstance that I can only say that I do like it very much a certain percentage of the time. 45% of the time, I really like the adventure and the self-sufficiency. 45%-the hard physical and mental work make me question the choice. 10% of the time, usually when I'm cold and wet, I can say I hate it-this is when I question the longevity. And although there is monotony in the daily routine, there is also satisfaction in carrying everything I need on my back, in knowing that I can drink from a nearby stream, and in resting comfortably on the mountain. There is a freedom in this I can't explain and makes me think I'll stay awhile.    Been able to put in a few more daily miles now. Plan to walk 14 miles tomorrow with Portuguese. Once I hit Damascus, plan to stay the night there.     Wondering- Are the additional miles I am able to walk the result of my getting stronger? Or am I just benefiting because the days are longer (and warmer)? A little of both, I think.","Vanderventer Shelter

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529141,"Arrived yesterday in Damascus, VA.   The weather has been absolutely beautiful the last week and I was able to make good time.    Damascus is known as the ""friendliest town on the trail."" It is the home of ""Trail Days""- a festival given for hikers and many veterans of the trail. Folks travel back here yearly for a reunion of sorts- a chance to connect with fellow hikers from past journeys. I am a bit early for Trail Days this year. It's not happening until mid-May. Then again, the reunion in future years may be sweeter. This is also a big community for bikers-as in cyclers. The town if full of hikers and bikers as a biking trail heads right through it.    When I landed here yesterday, I decided to stay at a Bed and Breakfast. I was greeted by a wonderful lady who handed me a set of scrubs (flashback!) and told me to get out of my clothes. Handed me a basket of soaps and showed me to a shower. I laughed and commented that ""It can't be that bad!"". She said, ""No, no, I just want to do your laundry for you.""   WHAT!! Heavenly shower, sweet smelling soaps, and laundered clothes on the other side. Can't blame me for staying another night.   Nuff said.     Interesting that the Trail is filled with many native German folks. Seems there was a documentary last year that aired on German television about the Appalachian Trail. Sparked some adventurers. They are very determined, very clean, and very satiated. While many of us are reconstituting our meals with hot water and eating them from pouches, they stop and cook entire meals out here without missing a beat. Amazing German ingenuity....    Heading back out tomorrow with my friends once again. Looking forward to a visit next week from my wife who I haven't seen in way too many weeks.

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531331,"Left Damascus a few days back and have been walking in rain for a day and a half. Although warmer, the nights are still cold. Now that I'm in Virginia, I continue to wait for the trail to level out, but the terrain continues very hilly. But Virginia is divided into 4 parts on the AT. I am in Part one currently and have hope that Part 2 and beyond have the promise of more level land. Although I am not officially behind and could still make the end by September, I am hoping to put in more daily miles when the hills level out.    I stayed in an interesting location in Damascus, called the Montgomery Homestead, that holds a particular claim to fame. It seems they had a visitor, a guy by the name of Bismark, who walked the trail for 5 consecutive years and stayed there every year. One day, while staying at the Homestead, everyone there was surprised when the authorities showed up to arrest this guy. Seems he was wanted for embezzling 8 million dollars from his former employer and decided to use the AT as cover. Worked for awhile. The homestead got semi-famous and they have a great story to tell. They also have, and display, the log book that he actually decided to sign. Guess he was thinking he was pretty safe out here.    From Damascus I crossed Mount Rogers and then got into the Grayson Highlands which are famous for the wild ponies that eat the grasses in the upper meadows (picture attached of the ponies). There were a few babies and several very pregnant females. Enjoyed seeing them.    I have seen some other wild-life. I came across another field where 3 large bulls were grazing. There was no fence between us and they took me a bit by surprise. For a moment, we just stared at each other (I holding my breath while 3 large bulls sized me up). After a time, one bull turned and trotted away and the other 2 followed. Guess they can't be too much of a problem to hikers since they have the run of the land (wishful thinking?) I have also seen a woodpecker for the first time in my life (have heard them plenty, but never seen one). He had a big red head, was grey but when he spread his wings, there was white on the underside. Pretty. There have been deer, which look a lot like Wisconsin deer. And yes, we finally saw a bear. My friend Portuguese was walking ahead of me when the Black Bear crossed the trail ahead of us. We stopped, of course, and the bear saw us, then turned to run away. I only saw his back side as he was running. Portuguese was happy for the sighting (he really wanted to see one somewhere out here). But we were both relieved that the bear ran from us and not the other way around.      Some trail folks come with hiking names, others wait to be given them out here. One night in camp, we gave an unnamed hiker his trail name. It went like this. One of the younger hikers- a talented 25 year old- made this guy a hiking stick out of a small tree that he de-branched, wrapped with cord then heat shrunk.   This burly guy had a beard, liked to wear a blanket around his waist to stay warm, and now had a tall new hiking stick which looks like a staph. So put it all together, Moses! So there you go.    We crossed paths with 3 nice ladies after Grayson Highlands who are section hiking the trail. One of these ladies has walked the entire trail over a total of 22 years. Had a great conversation with them I really enjoyed. They will be driving ahead and heading south so I am hoping we will cross paths once more.    I officially crossed the quarter way point a few days back and feel I am getting stronger. I am happy to be enjoying the beauty of the scenery, the trees that are leafing and the spring flowers, and the breathtaking mountain vistas.     I am planning to walk to Mile 574 where Mary Jo is meeting up with me near Burke's Garden. I am looking forward to seeing her and taking a few days off the trail.    Wondering- About how awesome the experience is to live within these natural places, and not just drive by them in a car. Lucky..","

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531359,"Back at it after a weekend off the trail with Mary Jo. She picked me up near Burke's Garden after providing a trail magic picnic lunch on top of the mountain for Portuguese and me. While Portuguese walked off alone without me, I spent 3 relaxing days with my wife who I haven't seen in 7 weeks. We had a great time and I managed to restock my calorie deficit in these 3 days. I have lost 25 pounds- too much, too fast- so was happy to eat well. She brought me back to Mile 574 on Monday and I walked on without my trail buddy. I am sad about this as he was a great walking partner. I need to get used to traveling alone again. I did manage to get to a campsite on Monday where I saw Nick, a familiar face from sometime back who took time off to heal a knee injury.   Since the bubble of hikers that I have come to know is ahead of me now, I will need to make some new acquaintance out here. It will be fine.     Mary Jo brought a new pair of hiking boots for me. The feet take the brunt in this journey and my old pair was giving way at the seams already. My feet are in pretty good shape. I still have the nails that I thought I may lose but no blisters. I take care to get out of my boots at the end of the hiking day, put on the Crocs around camp, and air them out at night. I am hoping for a smooth transition with the new boots. So far, so good, but I haven't walked enough in them yet to know for sure.    As I've said in other blogs, everything that you need out here you have to either carry on your back, make, improvise or do without. Like when your TP roll is running low- you begin to look at leaves in a whole new way. (Which species of trees....) But I've learned that the trail provides what you need in amazing ways. For instance, I was a few days from town and was running low on TP and Ibuprofen. I walked past an 1894 School House that said ""hikers welcome"". Inside was a cabinet and when I opened the door, there were TP rolls in individual plastic baggies and also a jar of Advil! I have seen other hikers find exactly what they need when they need it. Whether its from Trail Angels or left behind from other hikers, they have found warmer sleeping bags, air mattresses, bear rope. It always seems to be the hiker that needs it most who is the one that finds it. So appreciate the folks that support the hikers up here.    But I have learned one thing about the trail. It has its own ideas and you need to learn to take what the trail gives you. For instance, my plan was to resume my hike and walk 12-17 miles per day, which I have been able to manage on good days. I have had other days where I made good time and planned for similar the next day. But the land changed, and the mountains got steeper, or higher, or had more rocks or angles, and the distance just couldn't be done. This time, it was the weather. Heavy storms kept me to 9 miles/day the first 2 days back out here. My tent was wet so when the weather did clear, I stopped to dry it out in the sunshine. Hated to spend the pleasant weather not walking (never sure how long it will last), but a better choice to have a dry tent and sleeping bag for the coming night.   The trail has its own idea of what my daily walk will be and I've decided its best to work with what it offers.     Wondering- If Portuguese is safe and if I will see him again....","

Beats walking on last years leaves but the loss of the new ones a shame.   Glad I missed the head pounding...gotta be thankful for the grace of mother nature out here.    Was a grueling walk today. Headed up a mountain for many miles at a 35 to 40 degree grade- just a little short of climbing up a ladder really. Then had the downslope-same grade, and then up again until mile 12. Once at the top was grateful for the ridge. Level walking (""level"" is relative). The grade then was a mere 15 to 20 degrees. Piece of cake, catch my breath.

Plenty of good daylight to hike now and my average for the last few days is well into the teens. Am amazed at the 20 somethings out here that make this look so much easier than it feels for me. Seems there are 2 speeds. Mountain goat (not in this group) and sloth (may be a harsh and inexact description but its how it feels when confronted with the reality of my extra years). Let's call it the ""mature"" speed.   No need to rush!      Laugh when I head into town around here to resupply.   Back home I stocked up with the food I thought I would be eating out here. All processed, nothing fresh.   Pouches, packages, you get the idea. Never a comment or even a raised eyebrow at checkout even though I was waiting for it. Although my diet has adapted somewhat, I am buying most of my supplies out here and they are still pre-processed. When I go to a store, the clerk ALWAYS knows and ALWAYS comments on that fact that ""I must be walking the trail!"" My response- ""Yep.""

Been traveling with Poptart, Stenchy (who has since left the trail), and reconnected with Feral once again.     Glad that I had time to dry out my new boots. Not a spot on my feet and adapted well until my little ""incident"". I was crossing a rocky stream, step by step, stone by stone, thinking ""this is kinda dangerous"".   Next second I was on my side in the stream soaking wet. Miscalculation. Good news..supplies held up high and dry thanks to the Ziploc plastic bags I keep my essentials in (you learn that in a rainy spring). Of course, clothes on my back and boots another story. Received blisters on both little toes walking on in the wet boots. They're dry now and I'm hoping for more comfortable mileage.    So the picture of the bear (thought I wouldn't get to it??) Yes its real and yes I took it. I had to cut my walk a little short yesterday because my destination shelter was closed related to ""bear activity"". There was a female bear with 3 cubs ""nuisancing"" the hikers. (I guess that's what its called when we are in ""their"" way). Anyway, although I didn't stay there, I had to walk through the area the next day. Myself and 3 other hikers stopped for lunch. Before eating, I walked alone down a path to a stream to refill my water supplies. Returned, opened pack and began enjoying lunch. All of a sudden this young looking, very pretty black bear came walking up the path I just returned from! She came forward, we yelled ""go away bear!"" She stopped, looked at us, and moved forward. We yelled, ""go away bear!"" She advanced, but slowly, and we had enough time to get in a picture or two. She had no fear at all-would have walked up and helped herself to our lunches no doubt. Was I feeling threatened? Oh yes! A powerful animal, closer than the picture shows (probably came within 50 ft of us.) I had more courage with the company I kept or I'd have taken off sooner. I was with a dog and 2 marines (did I say the bear had no fear? These marines had way less!) When she kept advancing, they said, ""Ok, that's enough"" and grabbed some sticks, clapped them overhead, and walked towards her. She retreated to a safe distance (did not totally disappear). We packed up, walked on. So grateful to these young marines for their protection-in the woods, in battle, for the nation.     Wondering-About remarkable creatures- both wild and human.

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533674,"Yesterday, weather spectacular. Today, fogged in. Managed an 18 miler yesterday, planning the same for today.       Been a lot of wildlife activity this spring. Saw my 3rd bear today. Was traveling alone, easy miles, when I heard sticks snapping to my right. Looked over, was able to make out the image of a large bear not 15 feet away from me.   We looked at each other, I yelled ""Go away Bear"". and kept moving. Headed down the path, looked back eventually, didn't see it. Switchbacks on the trail, walked in and out of the area. Who knows the company I keep. Did not see him again.       Bears have been prevalent this spring. Theories abound. Some say the cold, wet spring has created a later than normal berry crop so they are searching for other food sources. Others blame humans for leaving garbage and crumbs on the trail. Makes us a source of easy food (not literally-they just want our Cliff Bars). More likely to hang around us for the leftovers. Think its a little of both. It is why the Trail adheres to a strict LNT (Leave No Trace) rule.   No sign that you have been there. Extends beyond food. Don't leave your garbage (Pack it in, Pack it out); stay on the trail and if venturing off, walk on durable surfaces (like rocks or grass) to not destroy local vegetation; dispose of waste properly (human waste is buried and should never be left on the surface); use biodegradable soaps and do not wash in water sources others may use for drinking water, minimize campfires and properly extinguish, and on and on. The rules out here need to be respected... and there is an expectation to follow these. Peer pressure palpable. For the most part, the rules are followed.      Besides the bears, raccoons active as well. Agile creatures, unimpressed by Bear Bags hanging from trees. A minor challenge.   They climb the trees, scale the branches, get to the supplies, hang from them, rip them open, help themselves. Lucky to have been spared thus far.      While I still believe the idea that Virginia is a flatter walk is wishful thinking, part 2 has definitely been kinder. Not flat, Oh no. But easier to move through once the ""ledges"" were behind me. (Held on to the side of a rocky mountain, picked my way through. Looked to my right, straight down). Don't really know why more people don't die out here. Although I am still finding that my upward routes are just short of requiring a rappelling rope, it is somehow easier. I am appreciating this part of Virginia. Every state is unique both geologically and because of different state park requirements.   Georgia was tough (but it was new). North Carolina figured out that switchbacks makes a saner (although longer) walk (thank you).   Virginia terrain gives more mileage. But no matter which state I'm in, I am amazed that those that charted this course thought it best to always go ""up and over"" the obstacles instead of taking some easier and more logical path around the base. Have whispered (ok, shouted) a few choice words for them out here.       Wondering- Who are these people and are they sadists?","

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534493,"Had a very hard week of walking. I don't think I've have seen the sun much at all through the month of May. Maybe for a few hours on particular days. Very wet, very muddy.   Slowing me down. Wet on the outside, wet on the inside as my rain gear is hot and I sweat beneath it. Walking is slick. Downward descents dangerous. I may as well slide down the mountains-wouldn't make me any muddier than I already am.   Definitely needing to find some positives for a mental uplift.    Spent a scary night 2 nights ago in my tent. Hard storm, extremely high winds, pounding rain. The wind so strong I doubted that I would have a tent over my head by morning. Thought at any minute it would rip open, blow away..leaving my exposed out here. When I'm not sheltering, its my only protection.   Long, sleepless night. Heavier gear when packing up thanks to the wet, the mud....    I stayed in my tent that night because of my previous nights experience in the shelter. Woke up in the morning as usual. Went to my pack and found small bits of material laying around it. Looking inside, I noticed a ripped shirt with holes. Nestled in the remains of the shirt was a mother mouse with 3 newly born little baby mice. Oh my. She not only did a number on one of my primary hiking shirts, she put a nice hole in the heavy ply plastic bag I line the pack with. She also chewed a hole through my tent sack. Lifted up the family, moved them into the woods. Inspected everything and felt relieved that the damage did not extend to my tent or sleeping bag. But I wasn't happy about the invasion.    As I headed for my walk that morning, I realized that I should not be going up, which I was doing. Was planning on a downward descent to start the day. Stopped. Took out my AT app and realized I had walked 1.1 miles in the wrong direction. Really??? It is easy to do. White blaze marks on trees heading in opposing directions (for the northbound and the southbound hikers). Not easy to orient your direction out here north and south-this winding trail heading in all directions no matter your destination. Clouds and fog close you in- you get the idea. Anyway, headed back to my camp putting an unnecessary 2.2 miles in without advancing. Had a very hard time mentally recovering after that and didn't make the miles I intended for the day.    There is a lot of poison ivy out here. I am very careful to avoid it but I seem to have a mild case on the back of my hands. My theory is that I set my pack down on some of it.

Decided I needed a break and chance to clean up, dry out.   The sun a welcome sight. Hope it lasts through my rest and beyond.     Remember how I mentioned that the trail gives you what you need?   And remember the little mouse incident? (Nursing mama chewing through the thick ply layer of my pack liner that keeps everything dry?) Day after this happened, I was walking along and noticed something white sticking out of a notch in a tree. Approached to find a sturdy, new, totally intact thick plastic bag that someone else left behind (a fellow hiker or a trail spirit-doesn't matter!) Totally meant for me. Require it for comfort and safety. Again, you get exactly what you need out here. Can't explain it. Don't really want to analyze it. Just really happy..      There is something hard to explain about being out here. Much as I want sun and distant views, the fog that has been a frequent companion gives a close, spiritual feeling that has no real words. Of course, that ""feeling"" tends to disappear as I head up another brutal incline in the rain where my cursing overtakes the peace. Such is the walk...these extremes are the experience.    Bears continuing their presence here. Yesterday I had a choice knowing I was coming into Waynesboro for the day. Stopped at a beautiful campsite with breathtaking views (harder to come by lately due to weather conditions as they've been). Anyway, perfect location to camp. 8 miles from tomorrow's destination, easy walk. Another site 3 miles up but either easy mileage to Waynesboro. Anyway, I was alone and my first thought. ""If I was a bear, I'd be right here."" No water at this campsite, but had plenty anyway. But something told me to walk on. So I did. Shortly down trail, I took a corner. Right in the middle of the trail was this beautiful black bear-my fourth sighting. When it saw me, it was startled and jumped a bit but stayed put and looked right at me. Eyeballing me. I yelled, ""Get away bear"" (its what the best advice says to do). He didn't move. Yelled again. It looked and sniffed. Hmm-no doubt seeing my heavy pack loaded with easy pickings. Text says I should throw some rocks so, ok, I hand tossed a couple in his direction. Not at his head, don't want to tick him off-just a lob to hit him in the back. He huffed, moved off the trail a little, but not enough for comfortable passage. I don't think I was making him angry at me, but don't think I was scaring him either. He seemed kind of annoyed like ""Really? I need to move?""   Anyway, I yelled again and he moved off to a more respectable distance and I was able to UN-comfortably continue. But all the time I'm thinking, ""What would I do if he doesn't move out of my way?"" There is nothing in the manual about this! Of course, I didn't BARK, which I am also supposed to do if I see a bear. (At least I have that.) They are beautiful, graceful, powerful animals though. Amazed. But I firmly believe that my instinct to move along away from that campsite was good. Don't think a night there alone would have been friendly to me.    Well I did make it to town today. Was greeted on my entry by many familiar faces I thought were far ahead. So nice to see them all. Happy for their company.

I crossed the 1000 mile marker some days back and have made it through Virginia (600 miles worth-the longest state on the AT). The Shenandoah in Virginia was very nice to walk in. Although the terrain did present some challenges at times (in the photo files you'll see a picture of a flow of rocks which is actually the trail in parts. In sections, there will be cleared areas, otherwise, its up and over!) Still it was easier walking. The wildlife was great. I have seen 8 bears to date; deer that are so unafraid of humans that they literally allow you to stand right next to them; raccoons that can get ornery and mischievous (I had one standing in the trail on hind legs just yelling at me as I approached-cranky!); toads, birds and florescent orange lizards (they don't look real-but they are); many beautiful birds. And snakes-as I've already mentioned and can do without. The flowers are beautiful, especially the Mountain Laurel.   Have some beautiful pics of these flowers in my photo log. I wish I had a camera that could take a good picture of the stars out here. They are so big in the sky. Beautiful.    As I am walking farther north I can definitely tell that there is more civilization around me. In the distance, I sometimes see city lights down in valleys. I can hear highway noises at times and find myself crossing roads more often than before. It is kind of surreal though, to be walking in thick, green, isolated forests only to appear through a small break out on to a busy highway. I cross the road to the trailhead on the other side and enter another small, barely visible path marked with the white blaze. On entering, I'm immediately enveloped back into nature like there is nothing else that exists but the trail. Its a brief contact that lets you know the world is still out there. One nice thing is cell service has improved,    Mary Jo was here visiting this last week and I was able to have a break from the constancy of the trail. She found me near Paris, VA and picked me up after a day of walking. I took one full day off but was able to do some slack packing on 2 of the days she was here. After sleeping very comfortably in an actual bed, she would bring me back to where she found me and pick me up farther up trail later in the day. Nice part of this is I could carry a lighter pack which gave me the opportunity to put in some good mileage. I managed to make it to Harper's Ferry, WV on the last day she was here. This put me right back on my schedule as I had intended to be there by June 7th. Yesterday, she brought me back to Harper's Ferry and she headed back home. I crossed over the Potomac River and was immediately in Maryland, where I am today. We had a great time while she was here. I managed to put a little needed weight back on as I've been losing too fast. Nice to be in the position not to care about taking in any and all calories I can get. Full meals, non-diet sodas, no food too rich. Today it was back to trail food. We also found an outfitters and I was able to buy a lighter, summer sleeping bag so I sent the heavier one home with Mary Jo. REI also stuck to their promise of replacing items purchased from them if there was any issue. I had a clip on my tent break 2 weeks after starting my walk. I was able to make a repair at that time thanks to a local man and some super glue, but have been worried about this clip holding up ever since.   They gave me a full refund and I now have a brand new tent. It's lighter than my other one by a few ounces (yes ounces matter in these packs!) And with my summer sleeping bag taking weight out as well, I think I did good.    We managed to find Portuguese while Mary Jo was here. He had contacted her the week before she left and they arranged a pick up location where we could find him. He has no cell phone so he contacts her through Facebook when he is in a town with a library. They set the time for 5:00 pm this past Sunday to meet on the Pennsylvania-Maryland boarder. It was an hour drive from where our hotel was but that's nothing.   The hard part was for him to show at this date and time and he had no way of telling us if he was unable to come. Anyway, we found the spot at 4:37 and he came walking up the trail at 4:38!. So nice to see him. The 3 of us went to a local restaurant and had a great dinner together, then we deposited him back to his spot. He is still a few days ahead of me. We walk similar daily mileage although I am planning to average a few more miles/day in the coming weeks (weather and trail permitting).   He rarely take a zero day but we are still hoping to meet up again as the walk progresses and hike together once more. He is a good walking partner and I enjoy his company.    Tomorrow I should be leaving Maryland and heading into Pennsylvania, my 6th state on the trail. I am a few days walk away from the halfway point and am looking forward to Part 2.

And snakes-as I've already mentioned and can do without. The flowers are beautiful, especially the Mountain Laurel.   Have some beautiful pics of these flowers in my photo log. I wish I had a camera that could take a good picture of the stars out here. They are so big in the sky. Beautiful.    As I am walking farther north I can definitely tell that there is more civilization around me. In the distance, I sometimes see city lights down in valleys. I can hear highway noises at times while walking and find myself crossing roads more often than before. It is kind of surreal though, to be walking in thick, green, isolated forests only to appear through a small break out on to a busy highway. I cross the road to the trailhead on the other side and enter another small, barely visible path marked with the white blaze. On entering, I'm immediately enveloped back into nature like there is nothing else that exists but the trail. Its a brief contact that lets you know the world is still out there. One nice thing is cell service has improved,    Mary Jo was here visiting this last week and I was able to have a break from the constancy of the trail. She found me near Paris, VA and picked me up after a day of walking. I took one full day off but was able to do some slack packing on 2 of the days she was here. After sleeping very comfortably in an actual bed, she would bring me back to where she found me and pick me up farther up trail later in the day. Nice part of this is I could carry a lighter pack which gave me the opportunity to put in some good mileage. I managed to make it to Harper's Ferry, WV on the last day she was here. This put me right back on my schedule as I had intended to be there by June 7th. Yesterday, she brought me back to Harper's Ferry and she headed back home. I crossed over the Potomac River and was immediately in Maryland, where I am today. We had a great time while she was here. I managed to put a little needed weight back on as I've been losing too fast. Nice to be in the position to not care about taking in any and all calories I can get. Full meals, non-diet sodas, no food too rich. Today it was back to trail food. We also found an outfitters and I was able to buy a lighter, summer sleeping bag so I sent the heavier one home with Mary Jo. REI also stuck to their promise of replacing items purchased from them if there was any issue. I had a clip on my tent break 2 weeks after starting my walk. I was able to make a repair at that time thanks to a local and some super glue, but have been worried about this clip holding up ever since.   They gave me a full refund and I now have a brand new tent. It's lighter than my other one by a few ounces (yes ounces matter in these packs!) And with my summer sleeping bag taking weight out as well, I think I did good.    We managed to find Portuguese while Mary Jo was here. He had contacted her the week before she left and they arranged pick up location where we could find him. He has no cell phone so he contacts her through Facebook when he is in a town with a library. They set the time for 5:00 pm this past Sunday to meet on the Pennsylvania-Maryland boarder. It was an hour drive from where our hotel was but that's nothing.   The hard part was for him to show at this date and time and he had no way of telling us if he was unable to come. Anyway, we found the spot at 4:37 and he came walking up the trail at 4:38!. So nice to see him. The 3 of us went to a local restaurant and had a great dinner together, then we deposited him back to his spot. He is still a few days ahead of me. We walk similar daily mileage although I am planning to average a few more miles/day in the coming weeks (weather and trail permitting).   He rarely take a zero day but we are still hoping to meet up again as the walk progresses and hike together once more. He is a good walking partner and I enjoy his company.    Tomorrow I should be leaving Maryland and heading into Pennsylvania, my 6th state on the trail. I am a few days walk away from the halfway point and am looking forward to Part 2. The constant rain has let up-which has been a gift.    Wondering- About the obsession to lose ounces from my pack, but add pounds to my body.   Interesting dilemma...","Ensign Cowall Shelter- Maryland

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538228,"Several important milestones this week: Left Harper's Ferry, the un-official halfway point, short of the official one, and passed from Maryland to Pennsylvania. Crossed the Mason-Dixon line, and am officially in the ""North"".   Passed mile 1094-the official halfway point. Now heading through Pennsylvania farm country. Very easy walking for me. Flat farmland. Folks call it death valley. Why? It's open, exposed to the sun. Water, while plentiful, is unaccessible cause of the pesticides used on the fields. No problem, just carrying an extra liter. Walked yesterday between a corn field and a wheat field-welcoming in their familiarity. Unfortunately, the trail between the 2 fields is full of poison ivy. Much as I try to avoid it, its impossible. Been suffering this for weeks. Benadryl spray an excellent addition to the pack. Thinking that it would be really easy for the AT trail lords to keep the ivy off the trail. But easier said than done. Here's why.    As you move through the AT, you see differences in trail maintenance and philosophy. There are several associations that tend to the trail and their different approaches create different experiences while walking. For instance: In the south, the ATC keeps that walk ""easier"" (believe that subjective-but it actually could be harder there given the terrain). They will go around some obstacles. The PACT prefers to make a more ""social"" experience. They'll lead hikers through parks and places more likely to see other people. Been walking through some of that and do like it since there are more facilities for clean up and chances to fill your water supplies from faucets and wells. The Sierra Club maintains regions north and likes a more ""natural"" experience (hence no poison ivy removal). There is a bar in Vermont where the trail once passed right through the building. Hikers would walk in one door, sit down for a drink, leave through another. The Clubs ""natural"" philosophy changed the experience by moving the trail so that it no longer passes through the establishment. The bar is still open and continues to boast its history. It's not far from the trail so many hikers still stop by. We'll see when I get there. 
Set up tent a few nights ago in a location that the book acknowledged was near a train track. Didn't know how near it was until I was settled in for the night. As I'm falling off to sleep, I begin to hear a train in the distance. Shortly thereafter, the ground began to shake a little, and then a lot more. The powerful engine kept coming and passed about 30 feet from me right on the other side of a grove of trees. Wow. Amazing power. Happened 5 more times that night. Laughed about it in the morning with several other nearby tenters as I was packing up my gear. Can't say we weren't warned! 
Had a wonderful experience a few days back walking with a section hiker. Her name was Mango. She was walking with several others and was going to have a visit from her Dad in one of the parks we were walking through. There was supposed to be a grill and swimming pool at this location. But on arriving, it was closed. A disappointment. But I happened to be there when Mangos Dad arrived. He brought with him an enormous spread of every kind of fruit you could think of: grapes, bananas, peaches, strawberries, blackberries, mangos... The trail magic open for the taking. I can't describe how great it tasted and then, as I set out hiking once again-I had so much energy I felt I could walk forever! I am amazed at the surge I feel from eating natural foods with actual vitamins and natural sugars. Thanks, Mango's Dad! 
Walked with 2 lady day hikers back in the Shenandoah, both musicians from Philadelphia. One is a pianist, the other a vocalist who actually sang for the Pope once. We had lunch together, saw a bear. Really enjoyed the conversation. I have also enjoyed the company of several others out here. Poptart, who took some time off to go to a wedding in Mexico. Enjoyed his company and hope to see him again. SoJo, the 70yo lawyer who manages to find time to do some work out here. Polar Bear, a frequent walking companion. Also appreciate Magic Man and the inspirational messages he leaves in the log book shelters. 
Since I'm writing about trail company I'll share a realization that came to mind a few days back. I have been impressed by the young 20 something hikers out here, both men and women. They are often students or young professionals taking time away to spend time on the trail. They are so nice, very polite, intelligent and interesting people. With all you see on the news and TV shows (which I don't miss for even a second), you can get kind of discouraged by the state of our culture. As these folks head back to there lives, I am hopeful that whatever my generation did for them, they'll be able to carry on and do even more for the world. It gives me hope for the future.

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538967,"Started the week with my sister in law in Duncannon, PN. Spent a great day and a comfortable nights sleep courtesy of Kathy and was able to launder and resupply.   Replenished with good company, kindnesses and a familiar face. Thanks, Kathy!    Last part of Pennsylvania has had some challenging terrain. Small rocks dot the trail with irritating frequency. Have to pick my way through rocks with no real footholds. Find myself stepping on sharp ones that cut through the boots. Slowing me down. Always amazed at what this trail offers. Rarely forgiving... Rested in Port Clinton last night. Not the plan but needed the break.      Walked recently with an older (70-ish) German-American couple who immigrated here in 1971. He finished the through walk at some point several years ago but she never did. They have been section hiking the parts she missed in previous years so she can do the whole trail. Unfortunately, she developed a stress fracture and hurt her leg. Heading home. Goal won't happen this year but they have fortitude and no doubt will try again.       Been walking with a variety of wonderful folks. Mango still moving through her section hike and going to leave at the Delaware Gap, the last town in Pennsylvania. She's traveling with 3 friends who have known each other since grade school- Shall Be, Gulp and Panda. Been also keeping company with Dreamcatcher, Rambo and Cousteau. Enjoy them all.          Amazed at the variety of speed and progress. I start out the day earlier than most. Many who start later eventually pass me as the day progresses. They sometimes stop, we have lunch. They move on-faster than me. But amazingly, we are at the same place by the end of the day. Or sometimes I'll see them days later-thinking they are much farther ahead but they stop to recuperate in town out of exhaustion from their long mileage days.   Sort of like running that yellow light just to be next to the same guy (who stopped at the light) at the next red light. Rushing doesn't seem to help out here. At least not for me.   Decided forward progress at my comfortable speed is all I can do. Ok with that.      Wondering- About the wisdom of Aesop's.

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539420,"Been sick the last few days. Started 3 days ago. Anticipated a 17 mile day. At seven miles, felt very fatigued. Stopped to rest and fell asleep on my pack right on the trail. Didn't feel like continuing, exhaustion deep. Made camp close by. Fell off to sleep, awakened to chills. Twice. No real symptoms except a slightly scratchy voice. Thought back a week to a tick (so many out here) embedded in my leg. Been checking for the circular rash, not there. But flu symptoms, fatigue are vague symptoms of Lyme's disease. Woke up next day feeling better-walked on a respectable distance, not wanting to overdo. Camped short. Fever and chills again overnight. Walked today until fatigue set in. Still no rash. If symptoms persist, will walk to a clinic a few days out for Lyme's test. My wonderful German friends, Dream Catcher and Rambo encouraging me to rest. Tell my so in no uncertain, beautifully accented terms, ""Wonder, you must take some time to recover! You need to rest!"" Feeling like a command from Schwarzenegger himself. Compelled to comply. So I will.    Picture is of my current reality. It's the path. No kidding. I don't really call it a path. I think someone came through here with some Agent Orange and dropped it in a line that extends through the northern half of Pennsylvania. DON'T like it. Not sure why this is necessary. On top of that, water is scarce here and a definite concern. A hiker friend tells me that every state feels the need to create obstacles so it has a claim to AT fame of being the ""hardest"" state on the trail. Wishing they'd be competing for the state of AT ""best experience"" or ""friendliest to hikers"". Personally looking forward to crossing into Jersey.    Been eating my way through currently, courtesy of the berry patches. The other day, I found myself within a very large blueberry patch that extended here and there for miles. A welcome treat. Stopped to help myself at one point only to hear, somewhere in the underbrush, a rattle from a pretty pissed off snake. Was not as friendly as others I have seen. Had a louder, more threatening rattle. Had a good look at him. Eyes darting up and down, tongue flicking in and out as he stared at me and dared me not to approach.   He moved off. So did I but with some worry as it's really hard to know where he slithered to. As I moved through the trail, I heard him again. Moved faster till it stopped. Whoo. Yesterday crossed a denuded mountain (from early 20th century zinc mining) that the state has recently attempted to rejuvenate. Very steep, rocky climb up this mountain. Glad for the clouds as sun would have exposed me. Anyway, at the top was met with a raspberry patch. Ate greedily with one eye on the berries, and another looking for snakes-and bear. Saw neither!    Said good-bye to my section hiker friends that I've previously mentioned. Yesterday, Mango left the trail along with her 3 friends. Saw her Dad again. He had more fruit! Also brought a few beers. I had one along side my German friends who never pass up a beer (their words!) We laughed about this. Told them I would love to visit Germany and their Beer Gardens. They told me to let them know when I'm coming as they would host me. Said that, in Germany, everywhere you go, there is a Beer Garden. If there is anything to see, a special site, a rock, a tree, anything in the tour books, you can be assured there will be a Beer Garden there. Can't dispute that wisdom.    Wondering- If there are any states on the AT that have a Beer Garden philosophy? Thinking Wisconsin could pull that off....","

Wonder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539792,"Want to start with a thanks to all the well wishers concerned about my health. The outreach on guestbook and texts are very much appreciated! (Oh and B Hiker- She left the trail-no more word from her).    As of today, I believe I am well again. Started the antibiotics 3 days ago. No more fatigue, no more fever. Expect to return to my 100 mile/week progress again-trail willing.     It was very hot today. Humid. Well, I have been expecting that. Weather a contender in the walk but must say I have had some great weather lately. Realize summer will bring the heat.     I have reached the Pennsylvania border and am taking a zero day here. When I start my walk again, I will cross the Delaware River into New Jersey. I am glad for this. The rocky terrain and scarce water sources have been a burden. Word on the trail is that the rocks are not gone in Jersey, but its friendlier passage despite them. Water on the other hand will continue to be less attainable until Connecticut. The water sources are different now. Instead of clear running streams, you have to draw your water from ponds with algae. With my filter and drops, I expect it to work but much prefer something that starts out cool and clear. Will see.    I've been thinking back through the states. As I've mentioned before, they all have their own character and experience. Each gives something in beauty, geography and challenge. But they all seem to take a little, too. Georgia broke my back trying to get used to the heavy pack. Virginia, with it's length and mountains, tested my legs. Pennsylvania-with the rocks, little water and add on my illness, messed with my mind a bit. But all in all, when I do an inventory check, I think I'm coming out ahead. Still have stamina, will and spirit. Humor? Some days. Oh yeah, I have gained a beard. Guess I'm doing ok.    Still, I know the white mountains are ahead of me in New Hampshire. Supposed to be the beginning of the hardest part of the trail. In the stillness, I hear them whispering, taunting, daring approach. Ok-one state at a time...    Wondering- and hoping- that New Jersey has kindnesses.","
