Kristen Kushmer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522853,"I suppose I should start at the beginning.Ok, just to backtrack, Shawn, Chip and I began our Appalachian Trail adventure a few year ago, with nothing more than a Walmart Tent, a pair of cheap sneakers and a whole lot of excitement. We were so clueless! Our first day I was sure we were lost at least a dozen times and I think we only did 5 miles from Springer and that second shelter. That shelter... That was the first and last time I stayed (note that the writer did not write 'slept') in a mouse infested shelter. Noooooo thank you.In the upside, we will forever have an inside joke from our first day on the Trail. Let me tell you a tale...a tale about a young man named Daryl. Daryl was invited on s hiking trip by his church group. ""Come walk in the woods with us"", they said. ""It will be fun"", they said. So, Daryll laced up his Timbetkand boots, buckled his heavy jeans, strapped his Coldmsn sleeping bag around his arm and grapes a gallon jug of water. Daryll was ready to hike the AT. That is, until Daryll got lost. How does one get lost on a single trail with ubiquitous white blazes? I do not have the answer for such a puzzling question. Only Daryll knows the truth. Up and down the trail, behind every tree and around every mountain side, the search for Daryll rang through the southern terminus. Fit runners with red faces called out for Daryll, silly young girls in floral tank tops shouted for Daryll, every single person was on the hunt for the mysterious Daryll.Apoarently, Daryll had had his fill of the AT and, without mentioning it to his companions, apathetically turned heel and went back to the parking lot halfway to Springer Mountain. Oh, Daryll.""DARYLL!!""Our second day had its highs and lows. The scattered showers were a bit of a downer; there's something frustertingly boring about walking with nothing but rain in your face and the 'swish-swish' of a rain jacket in your ears. Bleh. However, we did have several amazing moments. There was a moment in the morning, when the light was s filtered, soft, gold that was truly magical. Our third day was CRAZY. We rocked up Blood Mountain and then stumbled, tripped and maybe even one of cried a good bit on the way down. Neels Gap offered a welcome sanctuary, but the boys wanted to push on way too soon. I was tired. I was exhausted. I was delirious. However, we had no water. So, we had to keep going. And going. And going. I was like the drunk Enegizer Bunny; I kept going and going and going...stumbling and cussing my way down the trail. After a 17-freaking-mile day, I was done. I was so over hiking and smelling like stale Fritos I couldn't WAIT to get out if the woods and into a nice hot shower in Helen. So, I quit.I quit....I despise those words. I'm ashamed of them. I hope I never have to say them again.However, those words are a small reason I am pushing myself now to complete this southern section of the AT. She kicked my butt last time, but I have learned from her painful lessons and have grown to respect the suffering. Enjoy the suffering, even. There's beauty in it.Ok, I need to get off my soapbox and stop rambling! In a nutshell, a journey begins with only a single, clumsy step. And now I'm going to just keep going.","Springer Mountain

Kristen Kushmer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522733,"I have a dream. I have a dream that, in its essence, involves nothing more that a pair of good shoes, a 2,200 mile dirt path and whole heck of a lot of grit and determination. Many people reading this probably have the same dream. Some people are even living this dream (you guys are awesome!) However, I must approach my dream a little differently. I think of it as savoring the dream...relishing the journey that may take me years to complete. But I am here. I'm in it. The shoes are on my feet, I know where the dirt path is and I have the grit and determination to do this thing!So, here's the plan, finally out of the whims of my head and in black and white. I am going to hike the Appalachian Trail. I am going to hike each summer (teaching is the best job in the world), tackling 500 mile chunks.Starting, this weekend. Woot, woot!",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Tue",0
Kristen Kushmer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522735,"Let the Appalachian Trail Hiking Games Begin! There is a beautiful thing that happens every March in the southern Appalachian Mountains. People from all over the world, from every walk of life, come together with one dream in mind-to hike 2,220 miles to Maine. I love these people. These people are my spirit animal. 
Shawn and I made a plan to join these amazing people (aka: thru-hikers, aka: hiker trash) this weekend for a little shake down hike and I'm so so so SO happy we did.Day 1, .5 mileWe had a super late start Friday evening, so there's not much to report other than that we FROZE. With lows on the high 20's we couldn't feel our toes the next morning. Lesson learned? Wear double socks, fluff that loft and stuff the bottom of your sleeping bag with all your clothes.Day 2, 14 milesAfter defrosting our frozen digits in the brilliant morning sunshine, we climbed our way up to Silers Bald. It's amazing the moral boost you feel with sunshine on your face, mountain views all around and nothing but a dirt path and time ahead. This is my happy place.   After a few miles, and to our immense delight, we curved around the mountain side to discover a blanket of beautiful white snow. Geek out in the white fluff.  Soon we were winding our way down the mountain and saw the most beautiful thing any hiker could ever hope to find... Trail Magic!?! We met Trail Chef who is the true definition of a trail angel. He welcomed us over and set us up with a steaming bowl of chili, soda, chips and fruit. While slipping into a food coma, we talked about the trail and it turns out he's a teacher, too. Every summer he's planning on hiking 500 miles of the AT, which is my dream! Such a great group of guys and I'm so grateful to have met them. A few other hikers trickled in, most memorably was Road Runner, a badass chick who has hiked the PCT twice, the CDT, the Arizona trail AND the Hayduke. Respect. Meeting her and all the other awesome thru-hikers really ignited a fire under my butt and made me feel so inspired. I could totally do this.After leaving their warm fire and generosity, Shawn and I were PUMPED. That said, the AT has a funny way of always putting you back in your place if you ever get a little too comfortable. Shawn and I were actually talking about doing a 20 mile day. Psh. We were going up. Up, up, up. And when we went down, the trail was covered in treacherous ice and slippery slush. ""So, you thought you'de just go for a walk in the woods?"", the AT said, chuckling. ""Well, well, well, isn't that just precious. Good luck! Oh, and just let me throw some rocks, ice, roots and mud on your path...there. That's better. Have fun!""Well played, AT, well played.However, we finally made it up to the Wayah Bald Tower in good spirits. We were greeted with a spectacular 360 view of the mountains and had many snacks and treats. Summer sausage, cheese wedges, pretzel buns, snickers, gummies...it was beautiful.Also, Shawn earned a new trail name today, ""Landfill"". This kid can EAT! Seriously, Shawn gets 'hiker hunger' after the first few steps on the trail. It's adorable and astonishing. After Wayah, Landfill was still having delusions and pushing to do a 20 mile day...hiking into the night. Ladies and gentleman, if you ever want to know the true meaning of compromise, go backpacking with our significant other. Whew. We finally did (after a lot of stubborn and passive aggressive behavior, mostly on my part) find a nice compromise though. We went 4 miles more than I had planned and 6 miles less than Shawn wanted. We had the best darn cup of hot chocolate and a beautiful sunset right on the ridge line.","Winding Stair Gap

Kristen Kushmer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522761,"Much of this morning's hike was ROUGH. The wind decided to kick into high gear and I couldn't feel my face for the first hour of hiking. That wind was like ice slapping me in the face. My eyes were constantly weeping and crusting over. Nice.Finally the magical hour of 9 o'clock fell and the world began to warm. Around the same time, we wrapped around the sunny side of the mountain and from there we flew. The last 2 miles were a gentle downhill and we ran into so many thru-hikers. I want to hike with these guys! They all had such a look of happy determination...I really hope they make it! It must be such an incredible journey and it inspires me to tackle my own.500 miles in 2016, woot woot!!","Wayah Gap
