I've been done since the 21th of August and so ready to get back out there. I want to get ahead of the herd so I'm going to start mid February.,,AT Prep,"Aug 25, Tue",0
Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512731,"My new gear is coming in now and when I get it all, I'll be updating the Journal. 
I got moved into my temporary quarters and started downsizing my furniture and belongs so it will be easy to move it back into storage in February. Trying to adjust to not hiking for 13 hours a day and it's been difficult.",,Gear,"Aug 31, Mon",0

Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512728,I purchased my tickets for Gainesville. I'm taking the bus since the train is a lot more expensive. The official start date is the 19th of February.,,Tickets,"Sep 07, Mon",0
Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514764,"I received my Grand Canyon permits but they're for the beginning of November so I decided to hike the Tahoe Rim Trail. I hadn't realized how much I missed the trail until I put on my pack and started walking.
The TRT is a 165 mile loop on the mountains around Lake Tahoe. The east side is dry with a couple of water sources, the west side has many and also merges with the PCT for a few miles. 3 resupply points on the trail, Tramway Market in Kingsbury, the Chalet at Echo Lake (until Labor Day) and Savon Foods in Tahoe City.
Day 1 - I got a late start so I stopped early the first day and camped at Marlette Peak Campground to take advantage of the food lockers and water pump.
Day 2 - Got going a bit past first light and I made it to Spooner Summit late morning. I saw a couple of deer herds but they took off when they saw me. Stopped at the Tramway market for water and a Gatorade. Got going and camped a couple miles past Kingsbury south TH. The hiking on the east side up to Kingsbury South is not difficult, mostly ridge walking. After that, it’s gets pretty challenging.
Day 3 - I was up early and caught a great sunrise. I had breakfast and got going and made it to Star Lake mid-morning then took a break. I crossed over Armstrong Pass just before noon. The weather has been gorgeous so far and I'm watching Fall in action. I stopped before Big Meadow TH and got water at the creek and took a break. I took off and hiked a couple more hours and I'm camped at the Upper Truckee River just after merging with the PCT.
Day 4 - It was a cold breezy night so I got up before first light, packed up and took off to warm up. Stopped at Shower Lake to get water and started towards Echo Summit. Half the morning was up hill and then down. Ran into some hunters and they wanted to know if I'd seen any deer, I said nope. I wonder if they would still be out here if the deer shot back.I crossed HWY 50 late morning and then stopped at the Chalet for lunch. After lunch I got started into the Desolation Wilderness. I been through here a number of time and it never looks the same to me. The lakes are really low and I hope we get a good snow year. Lots of hikers on the trail today and I always laugh at some because their packs are bigger than they are. Another great day on the trail. Camped at Lake Gilmore and setup for Dicks Pass.
Day 5 - Oatmeal for breakfast and off at first light. Got to the top of the pass a bit before mid-morning, great views on top. Stopped for a cold coffee and bar at the top of Eagle Falls which also has a view of Lake Tahoe.Didn't see many hikers on the north half of Desolation Wilderness, I think because there's better access from Echo Lake. Got to Barker Pass midafternoon and I'm camped a couple miles past it. This week is going too fast.
Day 6 - I slept great till 4, then I woke up starving so I got up and ate, packed up and then started hiking. This is my favorite time of day because you normally get to see a great sunrise and there is also a lot of stuff going on in the forest this time of day, its fun to watch. I left the PCT about an hour later and as soon as I crossed under Twin Peaks and heading down towards Tahoe City I started thinking about the chicken strips I was going to get when I got there. It only took 5 days to get my hiker hunger back. I got to TC a bit past mid-morning and my eating machine was cranked up so I indulged. After, I bought water and got going. The climb away from TC was challenging with a full stomach but once on top, I was sidling until I got to Watson Lake. From the lake to my jeep at the TH is 27 dry trail miles this time of year. I topped off my water so I had 4 liters and got going again. Not too many hikers out today but I met a woman on her way to Tahoe City and she wanted to gab. So we talked trail and about the new Everest movie then I said so long. Hiked a few more miles and I'm camped a bit before the Brockway Summit TH.
Day 7 - I woke up at 1 hungry and couldn't go back to sleep so I decided to do some night hiking. I had a couple of pop tarts and a large coffee, packed up and took off. I crossed Brockway Summit a couple hours later and stated up towards Relay Peak. I took a break up top since it’s a 3000 foot gain from Brockway summit and I was wore out. I started down and got to the TH a bit before noon.
This was an absolutely perfect week and I would recommend this hike to the beginner or experienced hiker. If you plan this hike and need info, send me an email. kldurham1958@gmail.com",,A week on the Tahoe Rim Trail,"Sep 30, Wed",0

Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521414,"On my way! I left Lodi on Monday and got to Gainesville Thursday. I was glad that I decided to try the bus instead of flying for a couple of reasons. First, I've never driven across the southern half of the US and wanted to do. Believe it or not except for a sore butt, the Greyhound service was pretty good so I enjoyed the ride across and got to see some new places. Second, I got to do what I really enjoy and that's watching people. My stop overs in LA, Dallas, and Atlanta was a lot of fun because I got to be part of the show. ;-) The weather was good for the whole trip so other than a homeless guy coning me out of my pringles or another guy wanting to use my tooth brush, it was a perfect trip.I was picked up by the folks from the Hiker Hostel for an overnight. Got my gear and pack setup, ordered a pizza from Pappa Johns and hit the rack before hiker midnight. Heading to Springer Mountain in the morning.",,Hiker Hostel,"Feb 18, Thu",0
Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521479,"Got up, showered and packed. A sit-down breakfast was served at 8:30 then I was dropped at the TH for Springer Mountain. I got to say that the Hiker Hostel is a great segue to an AT start. The place is top notch and the best Hostel I've ever stayed in. Thanks again to all the folks at the Hiker Hostel for your hospitality.I hiked the 1 mile to Springer Mountain from the trailhead, took some photos and took off late morning. Lots of tree and bare foliage, if this was spring, I wouldn't be able to see anything so again, I'm glad I started early.Stopped for lunch a bit before Cooper Gap. My mind still wants to hike a break neck pace as I did on the last few miles of the PCT but my body says slow down so I'm hiking slow for the time being. Got to the Gooch Mt Shelter late afternoon and decided to stop for the day. It was sunny with no clouds and bit breezy, I couldn't of asked for a more perfect first day on the trial.","Hiker Hostel

Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521496,"Got woke up by a couple of raccoons going at it so I decided to get up. Had coffee and a pop tart, packed up and got going.I didn't get much sleep last night, 2 hikers and their dog came in about 8:30 and took two and a half hours to navigate their setup and dinner. At one point they broke out the SPOT and one guy shows the other how to use it...too funny. On my way out I looked up to see their 85 plus liter packs hanging on the food bag cable which sent me up the trail laughing. If I a see them again I'm going to give them the trail name of Heckle and Jeckle.Passed Woody Gap mid morning and stopped for a break. As soon as I did it started to rain so I put my rain gear and pack cover and took off. There wasn't much to see today because of the fog and rain so I just tried to get in the miles and stay warm. When I got the the Blood Mountain Shelter, the rain had stopped so I got rid of the rain gear. There must of been 40 day hikers there so this must be a popular place on the weekends. Started down and passed a continuous line of people...made it to Neel Gap mid afternoon. The trail goes through the outfitters and they have a hostel and small resupply. I checked in, bought my food for the next 6 days then cleaned up. The trail was windy, cold, and wet today but any day on the trail, is a good day.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

It was kind of cool hiking through it. Stopped for a break then got going again. I had my first Jolly Rancher today, I found them in the hiker box at the hostel. Also found my dinner for last night in there, Lipton spicy curry rice. I ate the whole bag and it was Yum!Passed a lot of hikers again today, I get the impression the folks here hike rain or shine. I forgot to mention the guy that runs the outrigger at Neel Gap did the PCT last year. He told me that there is no PCT kickoff this year, the new owners of Lake Moreno don't want it. Too bad because you can get a lot of good info there. Thanks again Pretzel for the accommodations.Mid afternoon the sky opened up so after a couple of hours, I called uncle. It was a wet day, but a good one on the trail. Camped at Blue Mountain Shelter with a bunch of thru hikers, they were gracious enough to make room for me in the shelter. I had a pleasant evening talking trail with them.","Neel Gsp

Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521631,"I slept great and got up before first light. It rained most of the night but had stopped before I woke up. Had breakfast and put my wet clothes back on, that will surely wake you up in the morning. Said so long to the other hikers and then took off. Mid morning the sun came out for a bit and I stopped to enjoy the heat on my face, what a great feeling. Got a good photo of the mountain range across the valley... I can finally see something. Dried out my stuff, then moved on.The landscape and foliage hasn't changed yet but I'm seeing small smooth bark trees that have very green leaves. I'm not sure what they are. I had lunch at Sassafras Gap then started over towards Dicks Gap. Mid afternoon I heard lots of thunder off towards the west. Before I know it, its sprinkling and by the time I get my pack cover on, the sky opens up. I'm thinking ""Bring it on"" all the way down. I got to Dicks Gap late afternoon and hiked down the highway to the Top of Georgia Hostel. I got checked in, took a long hot shower, did laundry and got my gear ready for tomorrow. The place was full because of the rain so lots of stuff going on.Even with the rain, I had a great time on the trail today.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Caught the shuttle back to the trail and took off. All I've got to say about the Top of Georgia Hostel is for the price, they'll do if you're in a down pour. I did enjoy the jibber jabber in the bunk house.Crossed into NC mid day, stopped for a photo then got going. I was hoping for sunshine in NC but no luck. The first 2 hills in NC were climbs from hell, half way up the second one the rain and wind was pushing me sideways and I'm thinking you dumbass, you had to hike in February. I've learned over the years, whatever happens on the trail always gets better further up the trail and it did. Stopped for lunch at Muskrat Creek Shelter, warmed up, ate and had a rest then got back to it.Stopped at the Standing Indian Shelter for the night with PFT, Eric, Pacman and John all of which I met in the hostel last night.It was a cold, wet, muddy day but I'm hiking and loving it.","Dicks Gap

Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521778,"It was a long night, midnight the wind started up, AT weather indicated winds up to 70 miles per hour so it was a bit challenging. Stuff was wet and going everywhere in the shelter. We all got up at first light and packed up. The weather is going to get worse, snow, high winds so we decided to head into Franklin to wait it out. I've never seen this kind of weather on the PCT so it pretty cool. We backtracked to the FSR at Deep Gap and walk the 5 miles to the gate off of Hwy 64 where a great lady named Beverly was waiting. We had called her from the shelter for a ride. She took us to the hostel, then to breakfast and the outfitter where I got some trail runners, my Asolo's just weren't cutting it any more. After the outfitters we went  to the store for our resupply and back to the hostel. Since I came into Franklin I'm going to grab enough food for 5 days so I can skip the NOC. The rest of the day was rest and drying gear and having fun exploring Franklin...great little town and definitely hiker friendly.Finished with pizza, beer and the movie gladiator.","Standing Indian Shelter

They weren't open yet so we stopped in at the Crabtree coffee shop for some coffee, southern music and checkers.After that, back to the hostel and then got a ride back to the trail. Thanks again for the rides Beverly!! Weather is clearing so we're heading back out. It's cold and there are snow flurry's but no rain.I really liked staying at the Gooder Grove Hostel. Zen the owner is just getting started but it has a homey atmosphere and has all a hiker could need. Great place to stay. Started hiking a bit past noon, got back on the AT a couple hours later and stopped at Standing Indian Shelter for lunch. Lots of down trees across the trail from the storm the night before. Made it to Carter Gap Shelter early evening, made a quick dinner and got in the sack. Lots of fun hiking in the snow.","Franklin, NC

We all jumped up and packed up as fast as possible since the only way to warm up out of the bag is to hike. Made some coffee and had a pop tart then got moving. After about an hour I warmed up and by mid morning the sun came out and it turned into a beautiful morning.   Made it to Mt Albert and the 100 mile mark late morning and stopped for some photos and a snack...what a climb. It was such a clear day, I could see the Smokey Mountains. Stopped at Long Branch Shelter for lunch then got moving again. My breaks are pretty short or I get to cold so I'm always eating in a hurry.Crossed Hwy 64 late afternoon and started back up the other side and stopped a mile later at a campsite.

Caught my first sunrise this morning, beautiful!Made it to Wayah Bald tower about noon, stop to chat with some section hikers and take photos then did another hour before stopping for lunch. Lots of great views today from the top. The last half mile there was lots of rutting from the wild Boar.

I had a great big cheese burger and chili then updated my journal and after we hit the outfittter to get our gear organized. Picked up some Tyvek for some added insulation on the snow and the shelters then got going up the mountain early afternoon.

Hiked to the top of Cheoah Bald Mt and stopped for some photos...wonderful views from the top. I found out today what the deal was at Neel Gap with all of the hiking shoes in the tree, those are from hiker that quit the trail there. I hadn't realized that only one in four hikers finish the trail. I thought there was a lot higher finish rate. Late morning the clouds cleared out and turned into a sunny day. There hasn't been much wild life on the trail so far but today we flushed a grouse. Got to the top of Jacobs Ladder a bit past noon and what a climb up!!! Stop for a long lunch at Brown Fork Gap Shelter. I had a signal so I made hotel reservation at Fontana Lodge for tomorrow then we got moving again.The rest of the afternoon was fast trail and mostly sidling. Finished the day at Cable Gap Shelter.

I spent the remainder of the day resting.I've found that hiking the AT is basically impossible to get lost. There's a white blaze at least every 100 yards. I'm also using Guthook's app for water, campsites and shelters and AWOLs guide for town info...this is a well defined trail.I've got the info on the trees and plants I'm seeing, the smooth bark tree is a Rhododendron, the ficus looking tree is a Mountain Laurel. I'm seeing Eastern White Pine and Hemlock.

A 5 star place in my opinion.Met my first Ridge Runner, Carl. He made sure we had permits and gave us some good trail info. Today was all uphill but good trail, stopped for lunch at Mollies Ridge Shelter. These are pretty nice shelter and they also have a fireplace in them. Carl was there and told us we had to eat outside, I guess there's a bear problem here. After lunch the wind picked up, then it started to sleet, then snow and we hiked the rest of the day in a snow storm.

This was the slowest I've ever hiked 6 miles. Lunch at Silers Bald Shelter then back at it. It was a very pleasant hike after the snow stop. Trail had about 2"" and got deeper as we got higher. Finally starting to see some evergreens - Carolina Hemlock, Red Fir, American Beach trees and Eastern Hemlock. We quit early today for 2 reasons, one the trail kicked our butt's and two, tomorrow we are hoping for clear weather so we get some views on top Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the trail. Camped at Double Spring Gap Shelter where I met my second Ridge Runner, Chloe so we all talked trail and stuff.

The trail was snowy and had some ice which was manageable, the trail was also full of hikers.Met 2 trail Angels at Indian Gap and they said they had sandwiches and fruit for us at NFG. I had 2 big ole ham sandwiches, 2 bags of chips and a orange. Thanks again Godspeed and Mountain Momma, they were delicious.The Gap was crowded so we ate, talked trail with the Angels and then took off. After we passes Charlies Bunion, we walked a knives edge for a few miles. I believe this is the Tennessee/NC border. Mid afternoon it started to snow again but it only lasted about an hour.

Met another thru hiker there named Tess and we talked trail a bit then said so long to her and Whodat then got moving.I haven't had a cell signal over the last couple of weeks, it's like ATT has limited service on the east coast but today on top of the tallest mountain, facing Tennessee, I finally got 4G and 2 bars, so I called my Ma to check in...Hi again Ma!!

Today, I mixed up some rocket fuel to drink with my protein bar before we took off, a couple servings of Whey protein and a couple servings of freeze dried coffee, it did the trick. Then boomerang mixed some too, but substituted instant breakfast for whey and I think he's starting to like coffee.Another overcast day but no wind. We watched a pretty nice sunrise and also got a good photo of it. Had breakfast at Hogback Ridge Shelter, then got moving again.

Despite the cold, it was a beautiful day with not one cloud in the sky.Crossed VA 614 and climbed back up top and hiked the ridge for a bit then down to Bryant Ridge Shelter.  I had to stop because this was the best Shelter I've seen on the trail so far.  Took a couple photos, grabbed some water then started the climb back to the ridge. I stopped half way up for lunch then finished the climb to Apple Orchard Mountain late afternoon. Very nice views up there and it's also had a FAA tower. On the way down I entered the Thunder Ridge Wilderness and a few minutes later passed under the guillotine. Its a big rock pinched between 2 bigger rocks and you walk under it...Pretty cool. I also noticed some snow on the ground. On my way over to Thunder Ridge Overlook, I met a section hiker named YOLO. He's going to hike the trail south bound and is out training.  We talked trail then I said so long. Good luck to you YOLO!Took some photos at the overlook then headed for my camp which is a bit past the Petites Gap which is not on a ridge and has no wind. Very pleasant evening and also caught a great sunset.","Bearwallow Gap

I tighten it up and dozed for a couple more hours. Getting packed up was a comedy show...I like to pitch my tent on leaves for added insulation. Well, as soon as I opened up, my tent filled up with leaves. What was even funnier was trying to pour my Whey in my Gatorade jug but I finally got it together and took off. Seems like I've been talking about wind since leaving Georgia so I'm done talking about it. It's just one of the things I've got to deal with on the trail. Very beautiful day! Short climb out of the gap then I mostly siddling until my first break at Matts Creek Shelter.  Had some great view of the James River on the way down to it. Crossed the river on the longest footbridge I've ever seen, halfway across I passed a couple Scout Masters. They were heading out to meet their group. We did a photo op and talked trail a bit then one of them asked if I've heard the owl mating call, he said it's mating season.  I said, ""I don't know, what does it sound like""? He went straight into it, did the male and female owl. I thought he sounded pretty good so I said I'd keep an ear out, thanked him and took off. When I was out of ear shot I started laughing...God bless the Scouts.Crossed the highway then headed up a gorgeous valley with a stream. Lots of stuff going on with the critters. I followed it for awhile then up to the ridge. I grabbed some water on the way up and had lunch on the top. Took a great photo of the James River from up there. After lunch I headed over to Bluff Mountain and got there a bit past mid afternoon. Some more great views and I had cell service so I took photos then updated my journal and started down. Thunder storm rolled through on my way down so I got some.

Got to the highway then started the climb from hell up to Cole Mountain. The higher I got, the colder it got. I stopped just before Bald Knob to sit in the sun and have some breakfast.As soon as I got going, I started thinking about the spam and cheese burrito I was going to have for lunch. I need to pack more snacks next resupply because I'm always hungry now. The climb up was worth it, the top was cleared and had grass and you could see 360, fantastic views! There was a sign on top, no camping in the clear or mowed area...must be a local hangout.I started down the backside and ran into a trail crew, we jibber jabbered a few and I thanked them for the work on the trail, then said so long...you could tell they were proud of their section.  Followed a ridge over to Piney Creek and had lunch. Siddling after lunch until I got to my last hour, then a climb up to The Priest Shelter. Gonna be cold tonight, the shelter is at 3900 ft.

I saw my first pair of Cardinals today, beautiful birds.  I think that's the Virginia State bird. Met Rambling Man today, he hiked the AT last year and was heading south for trail days in Damascus.

I had lunch at the Big Meadow Campgrounds and dried my tent. Didn't bother to see if the store was open. As soon as I got to the next ridge I started hiking the Franklin Cliffs, very cool...high cliffs on the right and a drop off on the left so I could see forever.  At one point I looked up and could see some folks sitting on the cliffs so I waved and wondered how they got up there, then I realized that the road was there. The cliffs lasted for a couple miles then I passed over Hawksbill Mtn late afternoon.  Took a break just before the Skyland Resort then pushed on. The trail after the resort was the AT and Stoney Man. I followed it until the number 8 on the self guided tour then the AT split off. After a bit later I came out on Little Stoney Man Cliffs and had a ""Holly Cow"" moment...What a view!

They had large packs and they were moving pretty slow. With the rain covers, they looked like turtles so I said hello and was smiling as I passed them. I guess you had to be there. Following the ridge again and stopped at Hogback for lunch then back at it. I noticed the shelters in this park are a lot better than in the Smokies, better maintained and a lot cleaner.Continued on the ridge and went over North Marshall Mountain mid afternoon, more great views then Compton Peak late afternoon.

Had a killer breakfast, got my resupply next door at Lion Foods, charged my phone then caught a cab back to the trail and was hiking late morning.  The climb was pretty easy and followed some private property. Up top, it flattened out and was fairly level. I stopped for lunch at Jim & Molly Denton Shelter, what a great place!

Stopped for breakfast at the Rod Hollow Shelter. It was a beautiful morning so I took a long break then moved on. I'm starting to see a lot more wild flowers. Yesterday, I saw some chives growing along the trail, at least they smelled like chives. Bet they would be good in my cheesy mashed potatoes. Started a section called the Roller Coaster, a series of steep ups and downs that went on for about 13 miles. Well, after hiking the mountains of Georgia and North Carolina these were a series of bumps in the road, didn't even break a sweat...well maybe a little one. Stopped for lunch at Sam Moore Shelter then moved on. Since leaving Front Royal, I've been seeing rock walls, I wonder if this were made from trail rock or if they're part of history. I imagine if you remove the man made stuff, it looks about how it did when it was settled in the 1700s. Crossed the 1000 mile mark just after lunch and made it to Snickers Gap a bit before mid afternoon. Started back up the next coaster and finished them late afternoon. Hiked ridge until I stopped for the day at the Blackburn Trail Center. Met Bear Bag, the Trail boss (he built the roller coaster), and his wife.

I stopped and read all of the stuff and took some photos. There was even a copy of the lost orders there.  Hiking through this area, I could feel the past and the history and it was kind exhilarating.

I had to stop a couple of time to breath it in. Too bad you can't bottle it. Mostly ridge and fast trail to the Birch Run Shelter.

In the shelter in the corner was a couple of small Bibles and some crosses with string for your neck. Well, I grabbed one of each. The Bible I read from time to time, it fills up my religious gas tank when I read a couple verses. The next town I got to I bought a small key ring and hung the cross on the front of my pack.

We're jibber jabbering about stuff and she looks at my pack and asks where I got that, and I said what? she says the cross. I tell her where and she tells me that she put the 2 Bibles and crosses in that shelter and other too, what a small world.

Then I hiked through a alfalfa field sprinkled with dandelions. The field ended at town so I started walking in town and by the town lake. It was like a high sierra lake, crystal clear. I found out later it's spring fed.My first stop was the Mid-Atlantic ATC to find out the best place for breakfast, they said Caffe 101. On my way, I stopped at the outfitters for fuel and MSR tabs.  Got to the Caffe and ordered the backpacker breakfast.  Eggs, meat, potatoes, toast, french toast or pancakes and all you can drink coffee.

Some of the water is diverted up stream through this and it fillers it through limestone to raise the PH downstream so the trout live longer...Pretty cool!There was also a coal mining town here too in the late 1800s and they worked for the railroad but the mines didn't produce much so they were shutdown. I hiked in between 2 ridge starting out then climbed over Second Mountain then down and entered Swatara State Park where everything is prohibited except hiking and breathing. It was raining so I stopped under PA 72 for my break and then moved on.Crossed the road and as I start the next section there's a big sign that says ""Wear Orange"". Do they think hikers will hitch into town and buy an orange vest? Here's a thought, if a hunter looks through the sites or scope of their weapon and can't tell the difference between an animal or a human, maybe they should hang it up and stay home...another thought, would hunting still be fun for a hunter if the animal had a weapon and shot back? I'm pretty sure they wouldn't shoot one of their own.So, I made it though that section without getting shot and crossed the Union Canal on a very cool looking Berlin Iron Bridge that was made in CT,  crossed under I81 and started up to the ridge.  There was a nice breeze up top that stopped the stickiness and kept the bugs at bay. I'm hiking along and thinking about what I'm going to have for lunch when I come up on a rattler...he waited until I was about 8 ft before he let me know he was there and I saw it about the same time, I jumped straight back, tripped and fell on my butt. I get up and wait a couple minutes to stop shaking and take a couple of photos and then give it a wide berth. That was a big snake and looked amazing.  I don't care how many of them I see on the trail, they'll always scare the crap out of me. Stopped at the William Penn Shelter for lunch and dried my tent and bag then moved on. Hiked ridge the rest of the day and had some nice views at Fisher and Kimmel Lookouts. Dropped down to Hertline for the night.  It was a very exciting day on the trail.","Yellow Springs Trail Junction

It's been awhile since I've had to do that. Got going after I had some rocket fuel and pop tarts, passed a couple section hikers a few minutes later.  I stopped and we talked weather and then the trail then I said so long. One of them got caught with his pants down, all of his stuff was wet. I felt for him and hoped the sun come out today so he could dry his stuff.Passed a monument for Fort Dietrich Snyder, a 1755 lookout post during the French and Indian War...pretty cool! Hiked ridge over to the Eagles Nest Shelter where I took a break and dried out my gear, sun came out just before. Couple of day hikers stopped in and when they found out I was thru hiking, gave me some soup.  I thanked them then took off.Big drop into Port Clinton and I went straight to the Peanut Shop where I bought Bazillion Nuts, Toffee Almonds and Peanut Butter Cups. That place is amazing and has just about any nut you want.  I sat outside in a rocking chair for a few minutes and ate my cups, they were wonderful. The trail followed the river then under the freeway then big climb out. Easier than coming down, it had one switchback. Finished the day a bit past Minnehaha Springs. Weather turned great and it was just another great day on the trail.","Hertline Campsite

It's next to a small observatory and there was a bunch of people camping there.Hiked ridge then dropped down and crossed a stream where I stopped for breakfast. Section hiker came by and we talked trail and he said there was fires in Shenandoah and some of the trail was closed. Washed my socks then got going again.Came off the ridge and crossed Hawk Mountain Road then back up to the ridge.  I stopped at Dan's Pulpit, checked out the view and signed the register. The box the register was in said ""Made in the USA"".I did a lot of rock hopping today. You can't take your eyes off the ground or you'll trip so I entertained myself by seeing how far I could go on top of the rocks without touching the ground. Kind of fun! Stopped for a quick lunch and moved on. Crossed Blue Mountain Summit late afternoon, hiked a bit then stopped at New Tripoli for dinner water. Hiked on and had a number of views of down below.

I was glad to be done with it.
West side of the ridge in the valley wasn't clear today, I wonder if it's smoke from the fire or smog, the east side was clear.  Hiked ridge then dropped down towards George W. Outer Bridge Shelter where I stopped for breakfast.  Met 2 other hikers, they were going south and we talked trail. 12 mile dry section coming up so I tanked up then moved on.
Got to Lehigh Gap about noon then started up the other side...what a climb.  What's the fastest way to the top of a mountain? Straight up and about three quarters the trek poles were stowed and it was hand over hand with some exposure.  Pretty cool! Traversed around back and the AT had a detour for 4 miles on lower trail along the ridge with a great view of the city below. 
Came down to Little Gap Road and there was a water cache there so I took a bottle. Whom ever left it, many thanks. Climbed up top and stopped for lunch. Got moving again and hiked ridge the rest of the day and camped a bit before Leroy A.

Sun came out late morning so I stopped at a spring and dried out my stuff. Assbagging day, so I took my time, Slip showed up for water so we talked trail, he got water and moved on. Lots of bumble bees on the trail, a couple days back, I was having lunch at a shelter and there must of been 10-15 of them buzzing around. A couple of times one would hover over the picnic table when I was eating and would be so close I could see its little face. Too funny!It was a very pleasant day hiking and I took my time because of the miles to town. Met up with Slip at Kirk Ridge Shelter (Met him a couple days back) and I hiked with him into Delaware Water Gap. Had a thunder storm roll in and out within a few minutes and the sun came back out. Nice views on the way down. Made it to the trailhead late afternoon and walked into town. I'm staying at The Church of the Mountain Hiker. Got a bunk and there's no laundry so I washed my clothes the field expedient way, in the shower with me.  Had a great meal with Slip and will hit the Walmart and the outfitters for shoes tomorrow...finally through with Pennsylvania.","A bit before Leroy A.

Kenny gave us a ride, he's a 70+ retired Army Guy so we got along great, I wasn't hungry so I gave him my big bite.  We stopped at the outfitters on the way back and I got some new trail runners.

So long Pennsylvania, the first half was beautiful, I don't know about the second half, I only saw the ground.I started the climb up to the ridge and stopped at the Sunfish Pond for a break then moved on. Hiking today was very pleasant, once on top I had views for days.  The trail would take me out to the edge from time to time but I could see from the top since there are no leaves on the trees yet.  I took a lot of photos and the afternoon went fast.  I had to take it slow today to break in my new shoes but I'm almost there. Hiked ridge all day and stopped for the day a bit past Rattlesnake Spring.

Hiked on and watched a beautiful sunrise. Grabbed some water and when I got to the top of Rattlesnake Mountain I stopped for breakfast. I've been hiking by a number of lakes and I'm wondering if they're connected.  The last one Culver Lake, was pretty good size and had a lot of big homes around it. I dropped down and crossed US 206 and started up top and I kept hearing a cry, like a baby bird. I turn around and go back and I see this snake with half a frog sticking out of its mouth. I've never seen anything like this before so I take a couple photos and watch a bit. Nature in action, pretty cool.I get up top and I see 3 very large ant hills, they look like fire ants and I haven't seen any hills like this since leaving Texas. Hiked a bit farther and stopped at the Gren Anderson Shelter for lunch. Boomerang showed up so we had lunch then hiked together a bit in the afternoon then he went on. Most of the afternoon was rolling climbs switching ridges. The morning sun turned to afternoon clouds and it started to rain mid afternoon and continued.

Once I left the state park I started hiking through farmland with rolling hills and I left the rocky trail behind me.I crossed a number of roads and the plan was to go in to Unionville for some breakfast and snacks. When I got to the road junction, I started the walk in and decided to look up the place and I googled it...closed for good. I hate it when that happens so I turned around and got back on the trail.  Stopped for breakfast at few minutes later.I did a short stretch of road then into a wildlife preserve I think for birds. There were pairs of Canadian Geese sitting in the trail. You know what you get with geese...Yep, all over the trail. As I approached them, they flew off together, I didn't know they would pair up like that. Left the farmland and started hiking residential with a lot of ups and downs.  Crossed County Rd 517 and got on a Boardwalk that was almost a mile long over a marsh. About halfway there was a suspension bridge over a creek...real nice walkway.Went by another farm and then started up to the ridge on a almost straight up on 90 percent rock. when I got to the top there was a huge rock pile with a sign over it that said ""The View"", I had a good laugh. Did some ridge walking then entered Wawayanda State Park, stopped for water then moved on. I did a couple more miles then it started to rain again so I stopped and setup.

Continued the rock climbing for a couple hours. It was a lot of fun and I had some nice views. My Mini Sawyer died on me so I'm using just MSR tabs and finding a clear stream here in NY and NJ has been a challenge. I ran into an old timer that has hiked this area a lot and told me where one was so I took off and stopped at the Fitzgerald Falls for breakfast and to tank up on water. Took a long breakfast and dried my gear because the sun came out. YEAH!! I also got some photos of the water falls which was very nice. The water is brown here and in NJ there are bogs and the water coming out of them is black.  I don't know what the deal is with these bogs but they're pretty nasty looking. Hiked to Mombasa High Point and stopped to call my mon...Hi again Ma! Got going and started a series of steep ups and downs at each road. I was surprised that a couple of the climbs were part of the AT, they seemed too steep but I caught up to that old timer again and he told me this section is original trail, that the folks that put it in had the mindset of let's fix those hikers. I just can't believe that but what would explain no switch backs or the trail going up and down the hardest path when clearly there's an easier way. I need to look into this. Stopped for lunch on top just before the Sapphire Trail and enjoyed the sun. I had my Tyvek drying and these two slack pack flip floppers that I met earlier told me it was going to rain tomorrow...I said thanks a lot...Dropped down after lunch and crossed the interstate then entered the state park and the steep up and downs stopped. Had to take my pack off to get through the Lemon Squeeze then continued the up and downs the rest of the day.  This has been the most challenging day I've had in a long time.

The trails were so nice through this area. All the steep climbs had stairs made from rock, pretty amazing how they made them. Today was the first time that the weather has completely disappointed me. Hiking down to the Hutson River on these manicured trail with the amazing views would have been wonderful on a sunny day but instead, I got fog and rain.

It had feathers around its neck sticking out like a scarf, I've never seen one like that. I laid there a few minutes and listened then got up and made some coffee and took my time packing up. Day hiker told me yesterday it's going to rain again Friday to Sunday so I wanted to enjoy this morning.Finished my climb to the ridge and just missed the sunrise. Lots of spiderwebs across the trail this morning so I was full of them. What's with the bugs here...its like they're blind. They fly right into you, your eyes, your mouth. I swallowed some yesterday.Hiked Porcupine Ridge over to Goddard Shelter where I had breakfast. Crossed over Glastonbury Mountain a few minutes after I got started again. I've noticed when you hike above 3000 ft, it's just about all dense pine and smells great. Continued on the ridge until lunch where I stopped at the base of Stratton Mountain.  I got topside late afternoon and the only way you can see anything is to climb up the fire observation tower so I did and got some photos. The back side had some snow and ice along the trail. It also reminded me of Roan Mt, stone walk, green moss and dense pine trees.Finished the climb down and stopped at the Stratton Pond Shelter. Met John there, he's hiking the Long Trail and is from Vermont. We had a pleasant evening talking trail.","Melville Nauheim Shelter

I was hoping I would get a bye but no luck. The hike over to VT 11 went pretty quick so I held off until I got there for breakfast. On the way I met a lumber jack and he told me 100 percent chance of rain by 2, clear tomorrow and spotted showers Sunday. I was talking to John about the LT last night, he told me there are only volunteers that keep the trail up and they really only take care of the shelters and remove trees and stuff from the trail so the trail is, what it is. I told him I hadn't noticed how rough it was...Made it over Bromley Peak then the sky opened up, the lumber jack was off by a couple hours. Put on my rain gear and pushes on. Passed over Styles then Peru Peaks and I was soaked and cold. I fell a couple time and ripped the crotch of my pants so my shorts were wet, my top was wet from sweat so when I got to the Peru Shelter, I called uncle. I put on all my dry stuff and ate lunch.  Decided to stay put since it was still pouring rain and the trail was a stream. An LT hiker showed up shortly after me and we had a great afternoon talking trail. He hiked the AT last year going south bound. We shared best moments while it was pouring rain.John told me the night before, May in Vermont is Mud Month. He also told me I was lucky since it was a very low snow year and the trails are relatively dry and don't have knee deep mud.  I had a low snow year last year on the PCT,  I wonder if I'll have a low snow year on the CDT in 2017. I climbed in my bag at 6 and was toasty warm and asleep a few minutes later. It was definitely a wet day on the trail.","Stratton Pond Shelter

I saw my first caterpillar on the trail, a black one so I watched it for a few minutes.Crossed Danby-Landgrove Rd a bit before mid morning and continued over to Little Rock Pond Shelter for breakfast. I also dried my stuff and sat in the sun for a while. A chipmunk came in for a look then took off.  Man they make them small in New England...and today is mud Saturday.Hiked ridge over to VT 140, on the way down I passed a trail junction for White Rock Cliffs and at that junction was a bunch of cairns. Really cool! Lots of hikers out today enjoying this great day. Got some magic from a section hiker, a Snickers bar and boy was it good. Hiked ridge again until I stopped for lunch at Patch Hollow. Got going again and crossed VT 103 late afternoon, boy what a climb back up. Finished the day at Governor Cement Shelter, met Chickery and Hoho there, both thru hikers.

I got to the top and then started a gradual down towards VT 4. When I got there,  I had a ice coffee and a peanut butter tortilla. Hoho and Chickery caught me and they called to make sure the Deli in Killington was open and it was so I took off. Made it to VT 100 about noon and walked into Killington. I decided I needed a hot shower and bed so I checked into the Killington Motel.  Walked to the outfitters and bought some new rain pants then the delivery store for 2 days food and my food for today then back to my room for a lazy rest of the day.

The streams are getting real clear and I want to stopped at all of them for a drink. I imagine they'll be like this the for the rest of my hike.I didn't spend much time on the ridge today but rather did a number of ups and down and I crossed a few roads which is getting old and I passed through a couple of fields which were gorgeous. The forest has changed in the last 2 days, there's leaves on the trees.  It looks completely different, more alive.Just before I stopped for the day, I ran into a porcupine and he high tailed it up a tree. Those things a so funny to watch. The weather channel said I got sunny sky's for a few days but as I start to eat my dinner, I'm getting rained on so I had to have dinner in my tent.

I heard a lot of elk on the PCT last year but never saw one. I'm not sure what I do if a moose comes at me but I would assume you run. It was a beautiful morning, I crossed a number of fields and 4 roads before I stopped on a hillside for breakfast.These new leaves are bright lime green and they resonate the sun lights so it's bright under the canopy. Gives you the feeling your walking through Sherwood Forrest.Crossed under I89 late morning and started up and over towards Hanover. Stopped for lunch at the Happy Hill Shelter and found some magic there. Whom ever left it...many thanks!Made it to the Vermont/New Hampshire border a bit before mid afternoon. I think the Connecticut River is the line so when I got to the middle of the bridge, I got a couple photos...nice looking river. I walked through town and didn't smell pine trees but I smelled money, Hanover is a typical college town. I stopped at CVS and bought some Whey then went to the Verizon store and got some tempered glass for my phone then stopped at the Co Op. They have everything you need for a resupply and the prices are reasonable. They also have tables and chairs out front so I used them to get my food organized then walked out of town.  My 3 days of food now weighs as much as 6 days use to.  Passed a couple more roads and camped a bit before Three Mile Road.

Still loving the hike, nature and the challenge and it will be over before I know it. Bull Winkle came by last night and raised my heart rate a few beats. I woke up to the crunching of trees and he was making this noise through his nose that sounded like a tribble horn, and pawing the ground. Really cool...I think he was looking for food. I couldn't tell how far away it was but it was getting closer so I yelled and shook my tent and it took off. I want to see one but with my cloths on and vertical so I can run if I need to.Got hiking my normal time, passed over Moose Mountain South then North Peaks and had great views on the south peak. When I got to Goose Pond Road I stopped for breakfast. The bugs added some protein to my oatmeal.Climbed up to Holts Ledge and again had some great views so I got a couple photos and enjoyed the views while I updated my journal then started over towards Lamberts Ridge. Some more nice views then I started one of the ATs crazy climbs to Smarts Mountain. I got to the shelter just as a thunderstorm rolled in so I had lunch and waited it out. This is the tallest peak around with a fire tower so I kept my head down.Looks like I'm going to miss the Huckleberry's this year. I've been seeing a lot of the bushes the last few miles. My mouth would stay purple last year on the PCT from eating so many. Storm passed so I got going again and got to the bottom late afternoon and crossed a gorgeous stream so I got a couple photos. Started up the other side and passed Eastman Ledge and then stopped at the Hexacoral Shelter for the night.

Amazing views and the storm left a immersion layer in the valley so I took a few photos. I've been having a lot more views on the peaks the last week or so. Since I started the AT, most of the time I'll spend 1, 2 sometimes 3 hours climbing these peaks and when I get there, no bone. The only view I get is of the trail going down the other side. I've been told they only get better from this point.Headed down and crossed NH 25A and when I got to the top of the next hill, I stopped for breakfast. Got going again and when I got to the top of Misty Peak, I called the hostel in Glencliff and made sure they were open. They were, so I headed that way and got checked in, showered and then got a ride to town for my resupply. I put together 5 days worth so I can get through most of the Whites without going back to town. Did my laundry and organized my food then rested and watched the Kingdom of Heaven and had a few cocktails.

There was no way across the stream at the trailhead and a sign with a road walk map around it so I put on my crocks and waded across...Felt good on my feet.Started up towards Mt Moosilauke and enjoyed the sounds of early morning. Dense pine started about three quarters of the way then I popped out on a ridge. It was about a mile across the ridge and you could see the summit and I felt like running.  There were large cairns along the trail and I stopped a couple of times for photos. The trees were dwarfed, I wonder why. Got to the top and was amazed how beautiful the views were, breath taking and this is only the first one. A lot of people up there and on the trail today so I got some photos and started down the mountain.Going down was a bit trickier, ice and very steep so it was slow going. There was no zoning today, instead I stayed focused on the trail and even so I fell a handful of times. By the end of the day the ice was so slippery, you'd fall looking at it. I followed a stream that got bigger and turn into a waterfall most of the way down. It's was impressive how they got the trail to follow the waterfall down.  Stopped at the bottom for lunch and then crossed Kinsman Notch and started up towards South Kinsman Summit. Passed over both the south then north summits early evening. My plan was to camp at the Kinsman Pond Shelter but it was full of people, plus the pond water was dark brown so I decided no way and moved on. All the streams up top were brown so I just kept going. When I got to the Cascade Brook Stream, the bridge was out so I had to hop across and lost the trail on the other side because it was dark, so I broke out the GPS, found it again and moved on.  I stopped at a campsite next to Whitehouse Brook and it was about 2 hours past hiker midnight when I climbed into my bag. My miles were hard earned but I had a big bone after each climb and it was a very exciting day for me.","Glencliff Hostel

A lot of thru hikers don't carry a map or GPS since the trail is so well marked. How about posting an alternative?Long climb up to Franconia Ridge and I stopped for water at Liberty Springs, great water. Followed the ridge over to the approach to Mt Lincoln then took a break. Passed over Mt Lincoln and stopped long enough to take a look then started over to Mt Lafayette which is the highest I go over today. When you get close to Mt Lincoln, you come out on top and walk ridge above the tree line for 2 miles. It was amazing, views forever. Lots of French people hiking and some of them don't like being passed by me but I kind of enjoy cruising pass people. Got to the summit a bit after mid day and was able to get a couple photos before it started to rain and hail. It wouldn't be a normal day on the trail without some rain.Passed over Mt Garfield then stopped for lunch at the shelter. Very slow going today. Next was the South Twin Mountain, the rain had started to clear when I got to the summit so it was cool with the sun and clouds. Took a photo of the three mountains I had just crossed then got moving again. Snow on the trail instead of ice so I could move faster on the backside.Crossed Mt Guyot then passed by the Zealand Falls Hut and camped just pass the Ethan Pond Trail Junction. I went long again today but by choice this time. I'm starting to enjoy hiking late. Saw my very first red moon on the trail which was cool looking at as I hiked.

Most of the day I was climbing up towards Mt Washington.Steep climb up to Webster Cliffs but once I got there, I had great views. The trail follows the cliffs over to Mt Webster and about half of it was straight out rock climbing so I stowed my poles and had a blast. Lots of exposure with little danger of falls off the mountain...unless you're dumbass. Passed over Mt Webster then Jackson then I stopped at the Mizpah Hut for a weather report and to buy some snacks.   They had homemade cookies so I got 2 of those too. My body is burning more fuel with these huge climbs and late hiking  and didn't take that into account when I bought food. The woman running the place offer me a stay for work but I said no thanks. Had my lunch and the weather was good until tomorrow afternoon so I headed up.Steep climb but I got above tree line pretty fast and rode the ridge all the way to the approach of Mt Washington. About a mile from the summit there was a sign that said. ""Worst weather in the United States, many have died from exposure. If there's bad weather, turn around""  Good thing I wasn't having a typical weather day or I would have had to turn back. Got to the summit early evening, took some photos, looked around, there's a weather station and a huge viewing platform and a train track coming up from the bottom. Very cool! Must be for transport.It was slow going on the way down, not much snow because of all the rock. The  backside had rocks, like Pennsylvania but on a slope. I also noticed that some of the rock has Mica in it so when the sun hits it you get a reflection. Just before dark I decided to stealth camped at trail junction, mile 1859.

The Hut was closed up so I grabbed some water and started up Mt Madison. Some more rock climbing with a view. Made it to the summit and took some photos and looked around for a bit. The trail does a U shape through the Presidential's so I could look across at Mt Washington.I followed the ridge down the mountain and got back into the tree line then stopped for a break at the Osgood campsite.

There was no view on top because the fire tower was gone but when I got to Mt Hight, I got a treat...the Presidential's were sticking out above the clouds, it was very cool and I got some great photos. which made my wet foggy day worth it. Went through my first ever pass on the AT. Must be a token...the Zeta Pass, then passed over the 2 Carter Peaks. By then it was dark so each time I came out on top, I had this wonderful view so I'd stop and look.

When I was in Delaware Water Gap, I purchased new trail runners, some Salomon XA 3D GTX and they've held up pretty good. I think I'm going to use them on the CDT next year. They're about as light as a true trail runner plus rigid enough that I can strap crampons to them.

They were such great hosts, I think I'm going to NERO  when I go into town to resupply, I mean what's the hurry to finish.Got started about mid morning and the hike up to Saddleback and over to the Horn was surprisingly simple. I climbed into the Alpine Zone and it was slab rock and dwarf trees, I had wonderful views. Stopped for lunch on top of the Horn and had a bug free meal. Ran into my first group of south bounders, they had a blue healer with them and it was barking at me so we spoke briefly.  They said they were very excited about the hike and I said sure you are and took off.I had a very pleasant morning hiking up but the afternoon got slow and difficult. Crossed the Orbeton stream, climb up to the top and stopped for a break. The streams was suppose to be forded, but I was able to rock hop across. Passed over Lone Mountain then the Crest of Spaulding Mountain. I stopped and took a photo of the bronze plague indicating the completion of the last section of the AT Georgia to Maine. It was completed August 1937...boy this is an old trail. Dropped down to the south branch of the Carrabassett River, crossed it then camped.  Beautiful evening tonight.","The Farmhouse Hostel

Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536337,"Slept great next to the river and I left my flap open so no condensation this morning on my tent. Town day so I got hiking earlier than normal. The Crockers were both a cake walk, skirted the south peak and passed over the north peak, neither had a bone at the top. I'm glad I decided to carry only 2 days food and resupply in Stratton, made the hike yesterday a lot easier.Got to ME27 a bit past midmorning and also passed 2000 trail miles..188 miles to Katadin. I hitched into town and was having a real breakfast 30 minutes later...Yeah baby! Walked down to the hostel, took a shower and got organized. Picked up 3 days of food across the street and spent the rest of the day hanging out.","Next to the Carravassett River

Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536692,"Had the hostel to myself...packed up and was walking to the breakfast house and a guy asked if I needed a ride back to the trail. I said yep and off we went. If you're going to stay in Stratton, you got to stay at the Stratton hostel with Stephanie and Shane. It's right next door to the White Wolf Inn. I had a great prime rib dinner there last night. Started hiking a bit before mid morning and stopped at the Horns Pond Lean-to for breakfast. Got going and ran into the caretaker for that lean-to.  We talked trail and about her job, she told me after Little Bigelow Mountain, it was basically flat until Katadin. I'll believe that when I see it. I got to the top of Bigelow West Mountain Peak and stopped for some photos, real hazy today but great views.  Passed over Avery Peak then started down to Stafford Notch where I stopped for lunch. Passed Little Bigelow and as soon as I dropped down, it flattened out.  The rest of the day I was dealing with rocks and roots and mud but no hills. I did pass a number of ponds, I think it some kind of water way.The ferry at Kennebec River runs 9-11 daily. There's a rainstorm coming Sunday, a real drencher and I have no intention of being in it so I went long today to get as close as I could to the ferry to be the first one across the river.  Camped at mile 2032. It was a hazy but good day on the trail.","Stratton, ME

Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536696,"Packed up and started hiking my normal time. There was so much moisture in the air last night, it was dripping off the leaves and sounded like rain. Passed more ponds and a couple of waterfalls this morning. Stopped for a break a couple miles from the river.Followed the stream all the way to the Kennebec River. I was about an hour early so I looked around.  There was a family of geese floating along and a fly fishermen. The river is beautiful and very wide.  There are danger signs that say to wait for the ferry. If they release water from the dam while you're wading across, you're hosed.  I made a snack and had some coffee while I waited.The canoe guy show up right on time and paddle across. Very pleasant man and we talked trail and about the river.  I signed a form and loaded on, then I got to help paddle across. Very nice ride!  Unloaded and took off. On my way up Pleasant Pond Mountain, I spotted a patch of Lady Slippers, white ones and I didn't have a photo of one so I stopped and took a couple.A few minutes after I started hiking again, I hear this bird shriek and I see this bird coming for my head so I dodge it and fall and when I get up, I see its a Hawk. It made 3 tries at me but I was behind a tree each time until I could get away. What a experience, it must of had a nest in the area. It was pretty unnerving.When I got to the summit of Pleasant Pond Mt, there were a bunch of women having lunch so I joined them.  Come to find out, they were from Massachusetts and up for a Bachelorette party and spending the day hiking. After they found out I had hiked from Georgia, lots of questions. I got all the names but I only remember the one that gave me food...thanks again Christina for the fruit. I had a pleasant time taking to them and when they left, they took my trash with them.Took a long time to come down the backside, rough trail. Crossed Moxie Pond and the Road and passed over Moxie Bald Mountain. This one was a bit easier to come down from. Camped at a tent site mile 2061","Camp site mile 2032

Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536778,"Up before first light and hiking. I put on clean socks this morning and they were wet and muddy within 5 minutes. That's one of the things I won't miss, being damp or wet all the time.  I also won't miss wiping spider webs off my face constantly and flipping spiders off my arms.First up was a ford of the West Branch of the Piscataquis River. There's a rope across but it worthless once you hit about three quarters of the way, too high.  I think it's for high waters so you can float across. Made it across then followed the river for a while. Did one more ford on the East Branch of the Piscataquis then headed to the highway. Called the hostel about a half mile out for a ride and made it to the trailhead a bit past midmorning.I was pickup up by The Poet, he and his wife hiked the AT in 2008 and own the hostel.  As soon as we got to the hostel, I got the tour. He also has a gear and resupply store...very nice operation. Cleaned up and did laundry then walked to Spring Creek BBQ for a tri tip sandwich with all the sides. The rest of the day I slept …let it rain!","Camp site mile 2061

Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536986,"The Spring Creek BBQ is the place to go in Monson, absolute best BBQ I've ever had... pricey but worth the money. It started raining late evening last night and rained on. I slept great in it and happy about my choice to ride it out. Finished my food resupply and gear cleanup. I had broken one of the tightening straps on my shoulder strap. I had just enough to knot it in the clip but now can't be adjusted, what a pain. I called Osprey when they opened and the service rep Emily, set up a new pack in an outfitters about 13 miles from Monson. I've seen this time and again with Osprey, they back their product totally. I've got about 3500 miles on this pack so it's done it's job. Thanks again Emily for your help.Rode over with the Poet and picked up the pack then did some shopping and back to the hostel.  Mailed off the old pack, 20.90 for a new pack, can't beat that with a stick.  Went to dinner and then packed up for tomorrow, my last section.","Monson, ME

Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537757,"Back to the bush for the final stretch. Had the hostel breakfast, packed up and caught a ride back to the trailhead and I was hiking again by midmorning. I had a great time at Shaw's and would definitely recommend the place for a stop over. As soon as I got going it started to rain. I had to laugh since yesterday, the day it was suppose to rain was sunny. I did the 2 Wilson fords then stopped at the Wilson Valley lean-to for lunch.  I also crossed some train tracks...in the 100 mile wilderness, too funny.After lunch I did my third ford on Wilber Brook and then followed it for a time.  I've been seeing a lot of South bounders and they're looking pretty haggard after this 100 mile wilderness. Hiked Barren Ledges then got to the top of Barren Mt late afternoon, took some photos but the view was hazy. The sun was in and out all afternoon and it stopped raining about lunch time. Got moving and grabbed water at the first stream and camped a bit before Fourth Mountain Bog. I fell 4 times today, slipped on roots and the last time landed on my knee. This is one of those days when I'm about ready for this hike to be over.  It was a wet and muddy day on the trail.","Monson, ME

Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537775,"Powerful storm came through last night, thunder and lighting and it rained most of the night and stopped before I got up. Packed up and had a pop tart then hit the trail. It was real breezy and I started to see the sun from time to time. I made up my mind I wasn't going to fall today so I took it slow and kept my eye on the ground most of the day. Passed a dozen south bounders before my first break at the Chair back Gap Lean-to. Dried my gear then pushed on.When I got to the top of Chair Back Mt, I almost got blown off, gusting cross winds but there were some great views. Started down and crossed Katadin Ironworks Road then did the Ford on the west branch of the Pleasant River. Pushed on then stopped for lunch at the Gulf Hagan trail junction.After lunch, it looked like the sun was coming out so I hoofed it over Gulf Hagas Mt, West Peak and Hay Mountain. By the time I started up White Cap, the clouds moved in, it got real cold, and started to rain. Up top I had about 50 ft of visibility.  I wanted to see a sunset and get a photo of Katadin from the top but instead I got a huge disappointment. It was so cold up there I didn't stop, just headed down with my tail between my legs. I passed 2 camp sites before I could find one that was open, all full of south bounders. I found one just past the west branch of Pond Road.  I ended the day with dry feet and I didn't fall one time today so I would say it was a good day on the trail.","A bit before 4th Mountain Bog

Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537777,"I slept great with the wind howling and I was glad I didn't ship home my cold weather clothes because I needed them last night, very cold. Slept in a extra hour then took my time before I hit the trail. It's overcast today with strong winds and very cold for this time of year. A few minutes after I got going I got to see my first moose. I think my approach was covered by the wind but I got within 50 feet before she took off. No antlers and she had darker fur than I expected but what a powerful looking animal. Seeing that animal made my day.The trail is getting very crowded so I'm glad I'm down to 2 more days till the end. So, is it really considered a wilderness if there's train tracks through it, roads with vehicles parked and traffic noise in the distance? I didn't expect any of that. Lots of tree and brush down across the trail today. Did my ford on the West Branch of the Pleasant River then passed over Boardman Mt, my last peak until Katadin. Stopped for a break after Crawford Pond. Hiked very fast trail today and by a number of streams and ponds. Stopped for lunch just before Antlers Campsite. Stopped at Pemadumcook Lake to view Katadin, but no way...cloud cover. Pushed on and finished the day at Namawanda Stream Campsite. Indian Jones, Yoda and a couple other thru hikers also camp there.  They had a food drop and showed up with beer and pizza.  They gave me one of each and it was wonderful. I met them all at the Shaw's and they're a great bunch of guys. I ended the day with one dry foot and I didn't fall today, plus I saw my first moose so this was almost a perfect day on the trail.","A bit past Pond Road

Slow going, roots, rocks and mud.Stopped at Nahmakanta Lake for a photo of the white caps and waves.  Another cold windy day, 4 days of this crappy weather but at this point I don't really care. The only thing that matters now is getting to the summit of Katadin. Did my last 10 x 9 on this trail and stopped at Crescent Pond for breakfast. I've been seeing canoes at most of the lakes for anyone to use, pretty cool. Left the pond then started following a stream up that was gorgeous. It looks like it carved it's way through the rock. It's impossible to keep my feet dry today, so much mud on the trail. Stopped for lunch at the Rainbow mountain trail junction then moved on.I met my 3rd Ridge Runner a bit later, Moxie and she hiked the trail in 2014. We talked trail and the weather and I found out she was hiking out to meet the Guardians. I told her they're right behind me and took off. I got to the Hurd Brook Lean-to and planned to stay the night but the guys showed up and told me that the weather for Sunday was 100 percent rain and thunderstorms, no good for hiking the mountain. They were going to skip ahead and do Katadin tomorrow. I thought about doing that but decided I wanted to finish clean so I got moving, I was going to setup so I could summit on Saturday.When I crossed the Abol bridge, I got a good view of Katadin and the sun had come out, what a magnificent looking mountain. I arrived at the the Abol Bridge Campgrounds and stopped at the store for snacks then moved on. The trail was great after I entered Baxter State Park and I got to the Birches Lean-to about 1 hour past hiker midnight and I was sleeping a half hour later.

Got up at first light, packed up and ate a big fat cinnamon roll I picked up at Abol Campgrounds yesterday. Got to the Ranger Station and signed the register, grab a day pack, left mine and off I went. Made it to the trailhead a few minutes later. Sign the register and took a couple photos then headed up the mountain.Followed the Katadin stream for a bit then stopped at the waterfall and took a couple photos. The trail heading up was just like the trail coming into Maine. Somehow I thought it would be mystical but it got very challenging pretty quick.  Lots and lots of bouldering and I was having a blast. There was only 2 people ahead of me and I caught them real quick since I had only a day pack on and 2100 miles under my belt. We talked a bit then I moved on. The climb up this mountain was something else and lots of fun.I had a almost perfect weather day and after the bouldering, it flattens out on top then another climb to the summit. I was up there all alone for about 30 minutes. There was a horn under the peak marker but I couldn't blow it right so I just yelled out.  Vince from Quebec showed up, he came up the knives edge and we talked trail and he took my finish photo for me then we just enjoyed the views. Started down and ran into the guys I'd met coming up and then a string of folks on their way up. Got back to the Ranger Station and picked up my pack and then met a guy outside and asked how I get to town, he opened he's tailgate and said get in...he was a Ranger heading into town and dropped me at the AT Café.

I had a request for it and also my meals during the hike. Breakfast:Pop tart - Oatmeal - cereal & powdered milk - Instant coffee & Whey (Rocket Fuel)Morning Snack:Nuts - peanut butter & tortilla, I'd eat a jar of peanut butter every 4 days - Protein barLunch: tortilla, tuna, spam or Tyson chicken, cheese, mayo, M&Ms, crystal light, Pringles Dinner: rice or potatoes or pasta, tuna or spam or Tyson Chicken, hot sauce, peanut  butter, crackers, cookies, whey protein.I ate a lot of the microwave rice because I could add water late afternoon and it would be ready when I stopped so I wouldn't need to cook.

Coach,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549729,"UPDATE… I hadn’t planned on hiking the TA until after the CDT but when I got home, I started climbing the walls after a month so I decided to start it in October. The Visa process was simple and I had it within a couple of weeks via online. I’m starting on the 14th of October from Cape Reinga heading south.
My life changed completed after the PCT and again after the AT, I was bitten by the thru hiker bug and all I want to do now is hike long trails. Some of the greatest people I’ve become friends with has been on the trail. My plan is to finish the TA and do a short stopover in Lodi to send my cold weather gear out then head to New Mexico to start the CDT. I’ll be hiking for the next year and loving it.If anyone is interested in following along, the TA journal link is on the left...",,Change of Plans,"Sep 27, Tue",0
