Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480374,"The decision has been made. I am going to do this! Since late fall, 2014, I have been reading everything I can get my hands on about the AT. Endless research online regarding equipment.Finally narrowed things down a bit as to what equipment I 'thought' I wanted, and it was time to pay a visit to the (not so local) outdoor store, an hour and a half hour drive away. I spent 3 hours at TravelCountry in Central Florida with two very knowledgeable staff members, who patiently set up tents, got out sleeping pads and shook out sleeping bags. This was after marching around the store carrying a backpack loaded with weight, trying not to fall over and knock over multiple store displays!! By the time I took the pack off, I was ready to get down on the floor and crawl into a tent to tryout pad and bags!! When Brian helped me off with the pack, I asked him how much weight he had put inthe pack, thinking maybe about 10 lbs and oh my gosh it felt heavy, awkward and had me wondering what 27 pounds would feel like!! He said ""twenty-five pounds"" and I was like, wow, maybe I CAN do this!!!So, thanks to their expert help, I have narrowed my equipment list down and will be working on purchasing the items on my gear list as things go on sale this year.A big THANK YOU to Brian and Todd at Travel Country in Altamonte Springs, Fl for their patience and expertise. Be seeing you again soon!",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Fri",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480454,"Now that the equipment issue is somewhat settled, it is time to think about food, my favorite topic. Typically I am a fruit and vegetable type person, with a little chicken/fish thrown in for protein. So imagine my surprise when a knowledgeable thru hiker told me I only need to focus on three food groups: ramen (which I like), Idaho instant mashed potatoes in flavors (never heard of it!!) and Lipton(?) pasta sides, also in various flavors/combos. Ugh. In discussing this dilemma with my more serious 'chef' friends, they have offered to help me dehydrate various things (fruit, veggies) and make some jerky. Never having dehydrated food before, except unintentionally in the bottom corner cupboard, it sounds like more work than it is worth. So Feb and March, 2015 will be spent dehydrating, taste testing and acclimating to re-hydrated and prepackaged instant foods (blah!) Seriously though, I am sure, like everyone else, once I get out there hiking, I will be so hungry it won't matter what is in my pack, I will eat it anyway. Just hope that piece of jerky I reach for in the dark recesses of my food bag isn't an old dirty, wet sock!",,View Entry,"Jan 22, Thu",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480491,"I have just finished reading the trail journal of Bad Camel,Popeye and Wrong Way Jalapeno, 2014. How great to be able to do the trail as a family. Many times Popeye (who is doing the writing)mentions using an app called Guthook. Has anyone else used this? I would appreciate any information about things like that.I have to laugh at myself, as I read the various trail journals, following each person on their journey. I feel as if I am right there with them through the trials and tribulations of the AT, but when I tear myself away from the page and look around, I realize I am sitting on the lanai, in my recliner seeing people going by playing golf! This is one heck of a way to hike the Appalachian Trail!!This makes my third entry. Now it is time to get down to business and get out of my chair and go for a walk. And yes, I may be carrying my golf clubs",,View Entry,"Jan 23, Fri",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481526,"It is a beautiful day here in Central Florida but only 50 degrees. What a day for a hike, so I grabbed a friend and out we went. Headed to a levy that runs along the Ocklawaha River. Beautiful walking surface, short grass on a sand/dirt levy next to the river. Not too much wildlife action, in spite of being the only humans out there, but did see a white tail deer, several sand hill cranes and some gray herons. I carried a day-pack with assorted ""stuff"" in it to give it some heft. Came home with tired legs and sore shoulders.....what a wuss!!As a reward for getting out there, I came home, ordered the hiking poles I have been eyeballing for some time, sank into my recliner and re-hydrated with a cuppa tea.Now THAT is a fantastic day!!",,practice,"Feb 13, Fri",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493778,"Time is flying by and I am feeling pretty good with my equipment purchases so far. After much ado over backpacks, trying on, looking for sales, returning defective pack, etc. I finally have my dream pack, an Osprey Aura AG EX 65 l. It fits great, and has wonderful ventilation. Can't wait to load it up and head out. Oh, wait. I am not going until next March. Sigh. Seems a long ways away. Starting to think about taking some practice overnighters late summer and early fall as I travel south to Florida from NY.Also bought my stove (Snow peak gigapower) and hiking boots. Settled on the Keen Targhee high top for the first section of the trail. Loved the wide toe box and instantly comfortable fit. I have been using my Leki poles. They are easy to adjust and fit well on the side of my back. Next focus will be getting my tent, sleeping pad and bag. Need to get working my summer job to pay for them!!",,equipment update,"May 10, Sun",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503639,"I have finished researching and purchasing finally. That process took months! I can't imagine what people do when they decide to go hike the AT and leave in 6 weeks. I assembled all my gear and loaded it into my backpack, swung the backpack up and onto my shoulders and just about fell over with the momentum! Good thing I wasn't standing on the side of a cliff. Looks like it will take a little practice being ""top-heavy"". My summer job has started and I get to schlep ladders and heavy tools around as an electrician's helper. Wearing my hiking boots and they are a dream. I am working out riding my bike in the hills of Montauk, NY giving my legs and lungs a good workout. Pretty soon I will add in some running and walks carrying my pack with weight.Now that the equipment decision fiasco is over, it is time to focus my energy on food; that is, figuring out meals, dehydrating, packaging......oh, I'm getting a headache just thinking about it. I think I will procrastinate a bit by reading up on the subject first. That I can do on the couch  If anyone has any tips or suggestions, I am very grateful for any information. This is my least favorite part of the planning.Also starting to work out plans to do some practice overnight hikes when I return south in September. Thought I would hit some parts of the AT in Virginia and Georgia, especially the Springer Mt. area. My goal is to get familiar with the start area during good weather. Hopefully this will lesser my anxiety when it comes time to start in March, as I will return to familiar ground. If you have any other suggestions, please feel free to leave an entry in my guest book.Thanks,Cuppa Tea",,View Entry,"Jul 04, Sat",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519910,"I am so excited; I am going backpacking for real! Not just car camping, but throw on a pack and get the legs moving. Here’s how it came about:As I wound up my employment in the north for the summer, knowing I had to drive back to Florida, I thought this would be a good time to test the water. But, I didn’t want to go it alone quite yet. Not being much of a gambler, I reached out to Shutterbug anyway, with whom I had had some journal entry contacts previously. Much to my surprise, she was quite willing to take a chance with me and get some miles in. Thrown into the mix was another hiker, Wild Thang, who Shutterbug had met on a previous outing. Here are three women, of varying sizes, ages and hiking experience, meeting up to spend the next 3-4 days together backpacking on the AT. Talk about fate; we all hit it off immediately and (spoiler alert) have been backpacking together ever since.I am at my sister’s house in western NY, sitting at the dining room table. Spread out before us we have an astonishing array of dehydrated food. It was totally overwhelming. Harmony House offers a backpackers kit, which I bought in order to assemble my own version of healthy trail meals (low sodium, low fat, low sugar). We dug in and started creating Ziploc packages. I was pleased with what we turned out, only to discover later that it would be my downfall.",,View Entry,"Aug 23, Sun",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519912,"I arrived at Outfitter 76, in Franklin, NC with time to spare. Over the summer I ordered a Western Mountaineering sleeping bag thru them so I was anxious to see if it was worth the investment. They had it all ready to go and even stuffed it into the compression bag I had brought along. Since the others hadn’t arrived yet, I asked if one of the guys would go through my pack and do a shake down. He did, and the only suggestion he had was to lighten up my food bag line. What he did was to pull the inner cord out of the sheathing, leaving me with just the sheath, or wrap. Now, did he finish this task? No, he did not. Instead he got it started, did half of it, and handed this glob of cord back to me telling me I could finish it when I got into the campsite for the night. Right, just what I wanted to do late in the day, when there is water to collect and filter, tent to set up, dinner to make and food bags to be hung, using this bird nest of a mess he handed me!The ladies arrived and we headed across the street to a wonderful bakery to have a late afternoon snack in case we never got to eat again and to chat a bit, getting to know each other. We hit it off immediately, chowed down and then went about the process of shuttling cars to various trailheads.We started at Deep Gap and hiked north to Standing Indian Shelter. Since we knew we would be getting a late afternoon start, and they knew I was a rookie, we only had a little less than one mile to hike to the shelter. This was my first experience with a shelter, and I must say I found it a little gloomy. None of us was interested in staying in the shelter and there were reasonably level spots for our two tents and one hammock. Setting up my tent, sleeping bag and pad went smoothly, although it takes at least 42 breaths to inflate my BA sleeping pad! Thought I was going to pass out. We didn’t have to face fetching water as we just carried full containers from the car. Then it was on to making dinner. My stove went together with ease and I was pretty pleased with my meal, eating every bit. Hanging the food bags didn’t go so smoothly as Shutterbug and Wild Thang tried to teach me how to heave that rock bag up and over a high branch while not get thwacked in the head, or losing the rope entirely. I did try, honestly I did, but after repeated attempts it was obvious I was doomed to failure. After kindly telling me that it takes some practice, they took over with immediate success. Whew! I was so happy to go crawl into my tent and retire for the night. It was comfy and cozy and I thought I would fall asleep quickly. Wrong. Once I stopped noisily thrashing around on my sleeping pad, I realized how many sounds there were outside! Plunk, nuts falling on my tent. Brush rustling, armadillo? Raccoon? Bird noises Bats? Owls? Shutterbug is saying something from her tent….. is she saying there is a bear? No, she is mad at the mice dancing on her tent. Someone is snoring. How the heck can anyone sleep out here in the woods with all this action going on? Not to mention trips to the privy…. ok, nearby bushes. Every time I move, rustle, rustle, crinkle, crinkle, my sleeping pad is so noisy. I fear I am keeping my pals awake and they will never want to hike with me again. So I hold really still…..and suddenly its morning.",,View Entry,"Aug 25, Tue",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519915,"Wednesday, Aug.26My sleeping bag was nice and toasty (15 degree bag) and roomy (semi-rectangular) so I wasn’t claustrophobic at all last night. The pad was wide enough (25”) to allow for comfortable side sleeping and curling up, but yet I didn’t feel like I slept much. Everything was just so different. But no matter, I was up about 7 am, just getting light out, and started packing up. Wild Thang was up as well and we got our food bags down and started breakfast. I had warned them that I like a more leisurely morning as I like to linger over my cup of tea and think about the day ahead. To prevent me from lingering all day, we had decided on a time to leave camp. Good thing, because I sure was enjoying just sitting there, sipping my tea, enjoying being in the woods as the sun was coming up. So peaceful compared to last night!! Soon we were ready to hit the trail. Our destination today was Carter Gap Shelter, 7.6 miles. I had never walked that far before, much less carrying a pack, but thought, what the heck, one step at a time. The challenge of the day was climbing Standing Indian mountain (@5300’ elevation), and then we rolled downwards, with a few blips on the elevation chart, to our destination. I discovered that I much prefer going uphill, as my knees complained about the downhill. Besides my knees complaining, my lungs had their own issues going on. They found the air to be much thinner at 5000 feet that it is where I live. In Florida, we eat our air with a spoon, as it is so heavy with humidity! Nonetheless, I was enjoying every minute of the hike. We filled our water containers at various springs. I used chemical treatment for the first time ever and hardly noticed any change in taste.Our hiking paces were remarkably similar and we moved well together, rolling into camp in the late afternoon. Carter Gap shelter area is very big, with lots of tent spots. Given Shutterbug’s issues with mice last night (her tent was closest to the shelter) we stayed well away from the shelter area. Wild Thang and I went off to find the water source. What a disappointment. After all the wonderful, clear springs we had used during the day, this one was a brown mess. But it was flowing, and we were in need, so we gathered what we could. I gave it the usual chemical treatment, but wished I had a filter, as there was a lot of floating particles in it. Oh well, just more fiber in the diet! Set up again went quickly and dinner preparations started. As we were finishing up, a little mouse joined us and was nibbling on something Shutterbug had dropped. I figured he would be happy with that, but nooooo! After polishing that off, he start going toward Wild Thang’s food bag and got shooed away. Then he headed for mine. Pretty soon the three of us were hopping up and down, grabbing our bags trying to get away from this tiny insistent creature. That brought dinner to an abrupt close and we went and hung our food bags on the one and only branch in the woods! How can that be, all these trees and no suitable branches? Time for bed, and I couldn’t wait to lie down and rest my weary body. I did a little stretching, as my legs were really feeling the mileage. I was hoping for a good night’s sleep, but it was not to be. Not long after getting comfy in my bag, I started shivering. Then the leg cramps started. Not just those annoying calf cramps that plague you once in a while, but vise like cramps in the big muscles of my upper legs (quads, hamstrings). Ow, ow, ow. If I held real still, I was ok. If I moved, bang-shiver, cramp, ow, ow, ow. So there I was, in the middle of nowhere, my body revolting by shivering uncontrollably and spasmodic cramping. It occurred to me, as I was going through this process, that perhaps I should alert my companions to the necessity of them having to carry my body out of the woods tomorrow. I crawled out of my tent, causing even more cramping, and hobbled over to Wild Thang’s hammock/tarp, timidly announcing myself (so she wouldn’t think it was a sniveling, crying bear!) asking her if she was awake. (In my experience the surest way to wake someone up, is to ask them if they are awake!!) She asked what was wrong, and I told her I wasn’t feeling quite well. I have never seen anyone move so fast. She was out of her hammock in a flash and took stock of the situation. Fortunately for me she had been a paramedic at some point in her career! She walked me over to the tree where the food bags were hung and got them down. I ate two protein bars and then downed an electrolyte drink she had in her bag. Soon I could feel the tension in my body easing. We made up another weaker solution for me to sip on during the night and after re-hanging the bags, retreated back to bed. The shivering and cramping lessened during what was left of the night and soon it was time to get up and make breakfast. Was I ready for another day?",,View Entry,"Aug 26, Wed",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519926,"I was not looking forward to today. It was to be our longest mileage day and we had to climb Mt. Albert. My body was fatigued and my attitude was not much better. But you don’t get home by standing in one place, so off we went. The hiking was very pretty and we had some good views. I was intrigued to see some of the rhododendron tunnels I had read so much about. What I wasn’t seeing or hearing were birds. I expected to see multitudes of birds. With effort I saw maybe 4. Where is all the wildlife? No deer either. Not a single bear, which was fine with me. Mice, chipmunks and a couple of squirrels occupy these woods. That was it. I have more wildlife in my back yard in a residential area!It was about 6 miles to Mt. Albert. The whole hike there, I was dreading it. I had read that there was a “bad weather” route around it, and while the weather was superb, I was praying that my companions might be interested in going around instead of up. Sigh, it was not to be. Instead they talked me into taking a nice 30 minute rest. Before the climb the trail comes out to a forest service dirt road. It was the perfect spot to take out your ground cloth, stretch out flat on your back and really rest. Then it turned into a yoga session. Shutterbug, instead of joining in, decided to take a video of Wild Thang and me doing our leg and low back stretches. Pretty soon we were all laughing, until a pickup truck came roaring around the corner and we scrambled safely off to the sides. Guess he was driving up to Mt. Albert and was in a big hurry! Rest time over, we loaded up once again and started the climb.Not knowing what to expect, except something steep, I was delighted to find it was a rocky, boulder climbing kind of trail. I like that kind of climbing, because it is slow, and you have to think and plan your route. It was even slower, because again, I began to feel dizzy (altitude) so had to rest a bit. Eventually the fire tower at the top came into sight and Shutterbug and Wild Thang practically raced up the steps to take pictures of the view. I busied myself clinging to the legs of the fire tower for security as I peered every once in a while at the view. Did I mention I don’t like heights? It was all I could do to wrap one arm around the steel leg of the tower while fishing for my camera with the other to try and take a picture. I gave up and decided to rely on Shutterbug’s expertise, as that is why she has that trail name. Soon they came down, and fortunately it was truly all downhill to Long Branch Shelter, our camp for the night.Long Branch shelter is a fantastic spot. It is off the trail a bit, downhill of course, but it has the most beautiful cascading stream nearby for the water source. The shelter is relatively new and was very inviting. We were the only ones there, so Shutterbug and I actually set our tents up inside the shelter and Wild Thang hung her hammock close by. With the door of my tent near the edge of the platform it would make it easier to swing my poor cramped up legs out of the tent in the middle of the night to stand up and stretch. After dinner, we all did some leg stretches and then took turns working on each other’s legs and back muscles to ease the strain of the day. You couldn’t ask for better hiking partners! Off to bed and thanks to Wild Thang sharing more of her electrolyte drink mix, I got through the night in relative comfort, managing to get about 5 hours of sleep.",,View Entry,"Aug 27, Thu",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519927,"Friday, Aug. 28This morning was truly leisurely as we had only 3 ½ miles to hike out to the car. I was up early and moved about quietly so as not to waken the others. I hiked up the steep hill where we had hung our food bags last night and managed to stay on my feet coming down. Had I slipped, I would have rolled all the way down until the shelter wall stopped me, it was that steep. Again, suitable branches for bear bagging were in short supply. After depositing the food bags on the picnic table, I made my way to the stream to fill up my water containers. It was such a peaceful, beautiful morning, I found a good spot downstream to sit a bit and soak my feet. Brrr, the water was cold, but it felt so good. Eventually, I made my way back to the shelter and found Wild Thang at the table starting breakfast.   I joined her and we made enough noise to get Shutterbug moving. Slowly we moved through the morning and by 11 am, we were ready to hit the trail. Talk of which restaurant to go to in Franklin quickened our pace and we got to the car in no time at all! Funny how non-trail food motivates one! We retrieved the other car left at the beginning and made our way to a wonderful restaurant in town. Needless to say, the food disappeared quickly and we parted ways, vowing to head back out to the AT soon.I climbed into my car and headed immediately to my favorite shelter, the Comfort Inn. Checked in (by now it was late afternoon), had an enormous cup of tea with cookies followed by scrubbing all the AT dirt and grit off in a long hot shower. Ahhhh. Ate my late lunch leftovers, ate 2 more dinners, fell into bed and slept 12 straight hours. I had requested a late checkout, but that didn’t keep the housekeeper from banging on my door at 11:30 am to see if I was still alive.",,View Entry,"Aug 28, Fri",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519928,"Wow, it felt so good to sleep and not worry about bears! Moving slowly, with aches and pains, I loaded up the car and headed south. I managed to drive about 6 hours without falling asleep, but couldn’t make it all the way home, so found the next so-called shelter. Yes, another Comfort Inn. My favorite. Big comfy beds, high thread count sheets, unlimited hot water. Who could ask for anything more? Again, ate huge amounts of food and fell into a deep 11 hour sleep coma! Guess I must have been lacking a little sleep, ha ha. Felt great the next morning and finished the drive home.Sunday, Aug. 30It feels so good to be home. While having my tea this morning, I reflected on my first adventure out backpacking. Foremost in my mind was the severe muscle cramping and how to best address that issue. After giving it much thought,and doing more research, I realized that backpacking the Appalachian Trail is an endurance event (duh!), and thus, needs to be fueled as one. My whole nutrition plan for that trip was wrong for the exertion factor. I was going to have to change my healthy eating routine to include salt, fat and sugar. Also invaluable would be electrolyte support. While I certainly drank plenty of water while hiking, I actually diluted the electrolyte balance in my system causing the severe cramping.I learned that although I did not train specifically for this journey, I was in pretty good physical shape for the short term trips. All my equipment, out for the first time, performed as expected, except my backpack belt which seemed a little large. I stopped at REI on the way home, and had them reassess the fit of my medium 65 liter pack and ended up exchanging it for a small, at no charge. Gotta love REI. My Keen boots, size 9 ½ were comfortable but I ended up with a few black toenails. Called LLBean to discuss the problem and then returned the boots for a larger size, at no charge. Love that LLBean!! While abhorring anything between my toes (ie. flipflops), I ordered some toe socks anyway to help prevent blisters on the next outing. It wasn’t long before emails were flying back and forth between my companions and myself and the planning for our next adventure started to take shape. Stay tuned!",,I lived to tell about it!,"Aug 29, Sat",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519945,"Wild Thang and I headed to Aquone Mountain Lodge in NC to meet up with Shutterbug. I recovered from our last trip and was ready to try again. Thankfully both my pals were willing! My food preparation was completely different. This time I was relying on the usual backpacker meals from Mountain House and Alpine Aire. Also stashed in my pack were my new electrolyte support from Hammer Nutrition, recovery whey protein powder and their tissue rejuvenator capsules. I was loaded and ready to go! The Nantahala Mountain Lodge (formerly Aquone Hostel) is a beautiful spot. Steve and Maggie, the owners, were warm and welcoming. We were the only ones there that weekday night so we had one bunkroom to ourselves. Dinner and breakfast were included in the reasonable price. Both meals were delicious and substantial. Had I not been about to set off for parts unknown, surely never to eat again, I would have shown more restraint at the table. But one never knows, so I politely ate everything in sight.",,The Next Adventure,"Sep 14, Mon",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519946,"Steve shuttled us to the Tellico Gap trailhead in the morning and we commenced hiking southbound. Of course immediately we were challenged by a steep uphill.   Did I mention how much I ate? Well, not such a good idea if one is to go straight uphill. It was a beautiful sunny day and as soon as that climb was out of the way, we began to enjoy ourselves.At Wesser Bald shelter we took a break and Wild Thang guarded our packs while Shutterbug and I went in the opposite direction to fetch water. Naturally it was one tenth of a mile downhill off the trail, which means hiking back up with heavy full containers! The shelter was kind of eerie because laying on the floor of teh shelter was a tarp, sandals and some clothes. We weren’t sure if someone was maybe living there? Lingering to find out was not an option as we had miles to go, so off we set.Most of the views were obscured by leaves still on the trees. Every once in a while there was a little path to follow off the trail which led to the edge so you could look across a valley at the mountains on the other side. At Cold Springs Shelter, right on the trail, we met a thru hiker enjoying his hot lunch and peace and quiet. I think he was glad when we left as we peppered him with questions about how he flip flopped his hike.We rolled into camp at Licklog Gap around 3 pm. While the AWOL guide states that there is water there, we sure couldn’t find any. Luckily we had enough among us for both dinner and breakfast so we didn’t have to track back or ahead to fill up. Camp was set up, dinner made, food bags hung with care (no, I haven’t gotten any better at it yet) and we headed to bed to read and catch up on emails. It was a good 7.1 mile day. I took my electrolyte capsules at intervals throughout the day and before dinner added the whey powder to my hot drink. I feasted on a Mountain House meal relishing the saltiness of it and ate every bite. Meals on the trail are an interesting event. We eagerly check out what the other person has in their food bag, thinking it is probably better than what is in front of us! It reminded me of school lunches and all the trading. The sun went down, the temperature dropped and we headed to bed after hanging the food bags. The insects were noisy tonight, competing with my crinkly sleeping pad, so I wore my ear plugs and managed to get about 5 hours of sleep.",,Up we go!,"Sep 15, Tue",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519995,"There was a pretty sunrise this morning and I was surprised to be able to see it as we were camped in a gap. Nonetheless, the sky lightened and pretty soon rays of sun were peeking through the trees. I was the first one up so I headed down the trail a bit, past our hanging food bags, looking for “the perfect spot” to take care of business. Even that early, you never know who might come hiking up the trail and I didn’t care to be caught with my pants down! On the way back I intended to get our food bags down and surprise the others, but Wild Thang had beaten me to it. I join her at the campfire ring across the trail from our sleeping site and we began breakfast preparations. Today was to be a light mileage day (4.1) because it included a climb up to Wayah Bald stone tower and vistas. Our intent was to enjoy the hike at a relaxed pace. We obviously are not mileage hounds! I always love being able to enjoy my breakfast and cup of tea watching the woods come alive. It is my favorite time of day regardless where I am. We did set a time to depart and we stuck to it. Off we went with Shutterbug leading the way. Although she is the shortest, Wild Thang and I nominated her best ‘spider web clearer’ ever! Understand that it is not her height that wins her that title, but her antics as she encounters webs in her face time after time. It becomes challenging to stay on the trail, we are laughing so hard. After a good hour or so of her being a good sport, and a great morning pace setter, I usually offer to take the lead. Being the tallest, I wipe out great quantities of webs so they are able to pass thru untouched. While I don’t actually enjoy spider webs in my face every few feet, they don’t cause me to dance and flail about. In fact, my performance out front is so mundane; both ladies hook up their music. Not much to see today as we hike on the side of the mountains. The leaf canopy is still very full and there are some tinges of color here and there. I am so busy looking at the trail for roots that jump up and grab my foot, determined to trip me that I wouldn’t see much anyway. Frequently I remind myself to stop, look up from the trail and take in whatever there is to see. It’s important not to look around as you hike, as that is when you find yourself planted face down in the dirt wondering what the heck just happened! Thankfully, I managed to remain upright all day. As we approached Wesser Bald tower you could tell you were getting close to civilization. The trail widens a bit, it is certainly more obvious and cars can be heard driving up the roadway to the tower. The view was pretty, looking across the valley to another mountain ridge. It made a good place to stop for lunch. There were a few people taking in the views, but not overly crowded, a nice benefit to hiking mid-week. Lunch and mandatory stretching session completed, we shouldered our packs and headed downhill a mile or so to our campsite for the night. This was a nice big area, with a stream nearby, so water was easily accessible. We set up our tents and hammock in one area and did our cooking in another, well away from the sleeping site. Shutterbug tried valiantly to get a camp fire going, but the wood was damp and it didn’t burn long. It was a nice to gather around it and cook our dinners anyway. Shortly after, we all headed off to bed as tomorrow was going to be a longer day.",,Easy Day,"Sep 16, Wed",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520039,"Today started off with a little bit of a climb. Since we were already at a little over 5000’, what’s a couple hundred feet more? Next was the challenge (for me) of dropping 1000’ over 3 miles. It was a constant downhill hike, complete with roots, rocks and slippery pine needles. We stopped frequently to rest our knees, snack and drink. The trail crossed a forest service road a few times, but we didn’t see any vehicles. We had planned on having lunch at the Wayah Crest picnic area. There are trash cans there and we were eager to not only empty our trash bags but also to enjoy sitting down at a picnic table, instead of on some hard cold rock. We came down onto Wayah Road, but in looking in both directions, did not see any indication of where this picnic area might be. Tired and hungry we kept going; back up, up, up to Siler Bald summit. This is a great open grassy area with a path leading off the trail and up to the summit. Quite a few people, day hikers and backpackers alike, were enjoying the views and taking pictures. All I was interested in was lunch, especially knowing I would see this area again when I thru hike in March, 2016. After chatting a bit with the day hikers we parted ways and went down the trail in search of a good lunch spot. That means finding chair height fallen trees or big rocks to sit on. You don’t want something too low to the ground, or you will never want to get back up! Lunch was a quick affair and we continued working our way down to 3800’, where we found a small campsite for the night. It had been a long day of 7.9 miles and it was after 4 pm when we set up. Next to the site was a beautiful cascading brook with easy access to get our water. Wild Thang found a good spot to hang her hammock, but level ground for tents was scarce. Knowing I had been having trouble sleeping on uneven ground, Shutterbug found the most level spot and kindly offered it to me. There wasn’t much room left for her tent, so we staggered them side by side and only staked out our outer vestibules. Hanging the food bags was again perplexing. We are surrounded by trees, but no suitable branches. Finally one was spotted up this very steep side hill, so Wild Thang (ace rock bag thrower) and I (supreme supervisor) scrambled up on our hands and knees. WT got the rope over on the second try and I connected the food bags. Then WT pulled on the rope, while I walked the bags further up the hill to lessen the strain of pulling the rope. On the count of three, she yanked hard, I let go, and they rose to their intended height. Wow! Shutterbug then climbed up the hill to help us tie off the rope. We slipped and slid back down the hill towards the tents. Chores done for the night, we retired to our quarters. Ear plugs in to drown out the snorers, the noisy brook and my crinkly sleeping pad, it was time to try and sleep.",,View Entry,"Sep 17, Thu",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520040,"The ridges on either side of our campsite were so high that it took a long time for the morning light to appear. Having a short and final day ahead of us, we were in no hurry to leave our warm sleeping bags. It was fun to lay there all cozy and just discuss whether it was time to get up, rather than actually doing it. We started talking about breakfast and what we were each going to have and that did it. I guess part of me was hoping my pals would read my mind and bring me my cup of tea in my tent. It was not to be, so up I got, packed up my tent and got breakfast goingOur hike today was uneventful. The weather for this trip has been perfect; neither too hot, nor too cold. No bugs to bother us either, except for clearing spider webs and no critters, great or small. BUT, today there were birds and birdsongs, so I was very happy. (I was also extremely happy about no great big critters too!) It was another beautiful day to walk in the woods. We made our way to Rock Gap around 1:30 pm. Steve, our shuttle driver, soon picked us up and whisked us back to the wonderful Nantahala Mountain Lodge.Maggie, Steve’s wife and co-owner met us at the door and sent us immediately to clean up. This routine keeps the hostel free of any nasty little travelers (ticks,bugs etc.) hikers may unwittingly drag in from the woods, as well as preventing contamination of the air by (offensive?) hiker odor!! You are also offered the use of spare clean clothing, while Maggie sterilizes yours. We each had travel clothes in our cars so we passed on the hostel garb. A hot shower never felt so good! Soon a clean Shutterbug was saying goodbye, as she was headed home. Wild Thang and I settled down to a cup of tea while waiting for dinner. We had chosen to decompress by spending the night instead of facing a long drive. After dinner, I took time to review our hike and make some notes. This time out my food was a great success. It was filled with sodium, sugar and fat. As a matter of fact, I added olive oil or coconut oil to each of my evening meals and found I didn’t get hungry again during the night. The backpacking meals on the market, while maybe not the healthiest option, suited my needs just fine, and I liked the selection I brought. I even added candy bars to my lunches and truly enjoyed them guilt free! The turkey jerky I used for my between meal snacks boosted my protein and sodium intake, and I actually liked it. The electrolyte capsules and whey protein powder were the right choice and I began to look forward to my pre-dinner hot beverage of Emergen-C mixed with whey protein. Sleeping was not such a great success. I love my Big Agnes Q-Core SL insulated pad, my tent and my sleeping bag. I was plenty warm, but then it never got below 45 degrees (it is rated to 15). One problem is that I am such a light sleeper I hear every single little noise outside of my tent. The ear plugs help immensely, but it concerns me that I may not hear something I need to hear, as it comes crashing through the brush. An even bigger problem is that of being kept awake by any little slope to the ground. I thought that being as fatigued as I was, it wouldn’t disturb me, but no. I have decided that I am going to look into using a hammock instead. I watched in amazement as Wild Thang set up her hammock and tarp in half the time it takes me to erect my tent. There was no shortage of trees from which to hang. I tried hers out and wow, was it comfortable. I liked being able to swing my legs out and standing up easily. I am reluctant to invest even more money into equipment, but without good sleep I know I will not be able to complete a thru hike. Time to do more research……………..",,View Entry,"Sep 18, Fri",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520102,"It’s time for another AT adventure, and as usual, an opportunity to test new equipment and an old body!Being diligent before making a decision in the case of tent vs. hammock, I am using this time in the woods to test the new hammock and tarp set up I recently purchased. After much research, reading and discussing it among those I hike with, I chose the Warbonnet Blackbird hammock and the Superfly tarp. I like the fact that the hammock has netting and the tarp is roomy and has doors. From Hammock Gear, I purchased a 20 degree underquilt, with additional down, giving it a 15 degree temperature rating. I held off buying a top quilt as I was not ready to give up on my roomy, 15 degree sleeping bag. Have you picked up on the theme that I am a very cold sleeper yet?   My food choices and nutritional support worked out great last time, so there was nothing to test in that area. I did bring a new variety of Mountain House (sausage and biscuits), Backpackers Pantry and Alpine Aire meals to try. The other new piece of equipment I was trying on this trip was a SpotGen3 tracking unit. This would give my concerned family and friends an opportunity to not only see where I was at any given time, but also afford them the peace of mind as I wander the woods.Yesterday I drove north to Atlanta and connected with Wild Thang. For the weekend, I was joining the Georgia chapter of Trail Dames for an overnight hike, Hogpen Gap to Unicoi Gap. This morning Wild Thang and I got up in the dark and drove to Unicoi Gap, GA. There we were meeting three other women and when everyone arrived, we shuttled cars to Hogpen Gap for the start. Unicoi Gap parking area was loaded with cars and all assortments of people were heading off in various directions. There were large groups of youth, ranging in age from 8 to late teens, being escorted by a handful of adults. It looked like scouting troops to me, and I was awed by the size of their backpacks. Group by group, they headed uphill, southbound on the trail. Since we were driving to Hogpen and hiking northbound, our paths were sure to cross. It was a beautiful sunny day, but with the wind blowing, it was about 40 degrees! The women waited patiently in the cold while I fussed about looking for something in my car. Not that my car was a mess, you understand,it was just packed to the gills for a trip up north for the holidays. Finding what I needed, we set off.   Once we were into the woods, out of the wind, I could feel the heat in the afternoon sun. The trail was easy walking. The trees were bare, having shed their leaves earlier in the month. Those fallen leaves hid all sorts of treachery! Rocks, roots, pinecones, branches; all hidden and waiting to trip you. A couple of the women walking ahead of me tripped and stumbled frequently. I noticed they were shuffling their feet through the leaves, like you do when you’re a kid, walking on a sidewalk full of leaves and leaf piles. It was no wonder they kept stubbing their toes and, in the process, making an incredible racket in these silent woods.    Needless to say, we did not come across any wildlife!The trail was nicely maintained and while there were ups and down, the elevation remained around 3500’. Low Gap shelter was the destination for our lunch break. We made it there in good time and enjoyed the warmth from the sunshine while we ate at the picnic table. This shelter was in good shape, and this was my first encounter with bear cables. I had read about them, but had never seen any. After lunch, my companions demonstrated how to use them to hang a food bag. What a great luxury! It’s just so much better than heaving rock bags over branches and getting hit in the head. It was time to get moving, and there was some groaning going on!   No one wanted to get up and get going, but we shouldered our packs and headed out. Our camp site for the night was only a couple of miles away near Poplar Stamp Gap. We got there about 4 pm and chose our spots to set up. There was a variety of set ups: three hammocks, one tent and one bivy sack! I was intrigued to see the bivy, laid out on the ground, but have no interest in trying one. After all, I am trying to get off the ground, not closer to it! My new hammock and tarp set up smoothly and I couldn’t wait to sleep in it. Once set up, we gathered around the campfire ring and started cooking our dinners. As darkness fell, we could hear voices and see the flickering of headlamps. Soon a troop of scouts went by, shortly followed by another group. Then there was quiet. Again, we heard more voices. This time it was cajoling male voices, urging the straggling young’uns along. I tell you, these small boys were dragging! It looked like they hurt all over. The bad news was that they had another mile and a half to go to where they were spending the night. As they passed, we showered them with all the positive praise we could possibly think of. They brightened a little and disappeared out of sight. By 7:30 pm, the last of the scouts had passed by. I couldn’t believe the adult leaders had planned such a long (around 9 miles), arduous backpacking hike for that age group.The temperature dropped rapidly after the sun went down and although we had a fire going, it was still darn cold. The weather report predicted temperatures down to 28 degrees and during the wee hours of the morning I discovered they were right………..",,Hammock vs. Tent,"Nov 14, Sat",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520121,"It is 2 am and I AM COLD. Here I am bundled up in a 15 degree bag, long underwear, hat, gloves, and jacket with the hood up, and I am cold. Every time I move, cold air rushes in to cool me down even more. I check the weather app on my phone and yep, it is 28 cold degrees. There is little wind, and the sky is bright with stars. How do I know this? Because of course, I had to get up numerous times during the night to pee. It’s one of Murphy’s Laws: the colder it is, the more often the human body has to pee. The only benefit to this was seeing all the beautiful night sky. I zipped my sleeping bag all the way up, pulled it up over my head and tried to sleep. I still felt cold spots. Finally, through trial and error, I discovered that if I pulled the bag closer to my body, taking out the excess air space, I got a tad warmer. Herein lays the problem. Now I am sure you have seen this coming, giving that I previously touted the benefits of this bag (semi-rectangular, plenty of room, not claustrophobic in it, etc.).   I had a major epiphany: because the bag is so roomy, my body’s wimpy furnace is not able to heat all the dead air space. It’s akin to trying to heat a 2100 sq. ft. house with a space heater! Therefore, I need to encase myself in the typical mummy style sleeping bag, which I was so trying to avoid. While I was laying there figuring this all out, I realized that while I was definitely cold, I was also very comfortable in this new hammock! So I focused on that thought while I waited for morning to arrive.Finally it was time to get up and I gingerly exited my hammock, trying to unfreeze my joints as I went. I could not wait to get some hot food in me, especially a hot cup of tea. The oatmeal and tea thawed me out and I quickly packed up, as we had some miles to cover today (around 8 miles). Off we set and quickly spread out as our hiking paces were quite different. Wild Thang and I remained in the back of the line. We had a slower, steadier pace than the jackrabbits ahead, but we would catch up at water sources and planned to lunch together. The hike today was minor ups and downs, with no great elevation changes. Not many views either, but it was wonderful to be able to see across the gaps and valleys. The trees were totally bare of leaves and everything had a brownish gray cast to it. I did manage to find a little spot of leaf color left. The photo doesn’t do it justice, the way the reds juxtaposed with the gray of the trees. We remained at 3500 feet until we hit Blue Mountain and up we went. The good part of the climb was that from there it was all downhill to the car, civilization, shower and food. We exited the woods at dusk, said our goodbyes quickly as the temperature was dropping rapidly. Wild Thang and I caravanned to the Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega to get set for the second part of the adventure. We found it without too much trouble, unloaded and staggered uphill to the Lodge swaying from the weight of our packs and overnight bags. The door to the building opened and lo and behold who should it be, but Certificate! She traveled from SC to join us for the next round. Having read her trail journal entries previously and hearing about her from my hiking pals, I was looking forward to meeting her. I got settled in, exploded my backpack in my room, got rid of the trash, showered and got into nice clean wonderful smelling clothes! Wild Thang had done the same and we all headed into town to have dinner and get acquainted. I devoured the largest Shepard’s pie I have ever seen. Back we went to the hostel to crash for the night. I went right to bed, hoping to catch up on lost sleep, as we were heading out again in the morning to hike another 3 days.",,A Bit Of Color,"Nov 15, Sun",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520134,"I set my alarm for 7 am as I had to resupply my food bag, swap out dirty socks, etc. for clean ones and take one last long hot shower. Breakfast was served at 8, and my, oh my, what a feast. I didn’t think I would ever be hungry again after last night’s dinner, but my hiker appetite was finally kicking in. Those of you reading this, who know me, are probably saying to yourselves “whaddaya mean, ‘finally kicking in’? You always eat like that!”   Let’s just say I upheld my reputation.   As we were finishing the last of our tea and coffee, Fran walked in. She is also a Trail Dame, from the Georgia chapter, and had come to join us for this leg of the trip. Wild Thang, Certificate and Fran have known each other for quite a while and have hiked together many times. It was fun to see them come together and organize us like a well-oiled machine.We loaded up two vehicles with our packs and set off to shuttle the cars to the start and the finish of our intended section hike. I had wanted to go to the start of the AT at Springer and hike north to see what I would be facing in March 2016. When I mentioned this to Wild Thang back in September, she offered to go with me, and suggested we tack it onto the back of the Trail Dames overnighter. Word got out to the others and soon our two-some grew to four. Shutterbug, who had been on a previous trip, was not able to make it. She was sadly missed by all! We wound our way around on the Forest Service roads, parking one car at Hightower Gap. Then we all piled into the other car and headed to the Springer parking area at Big Stamp Gap. It was about noon by the time we got the vehicles situated and secured. The ladies offered to wait in the car while I hiked up to the top of Springer Mtn for a look around. I declined. I will have to climb it in March to sign in, so why add extra miles? Hikers are so lazy! On went the packs and we headed north.I could not believe how wide the trail was and how nicely maintained it was. It was like a hiking super highway. We were hiking a nice, long easy downhill section, going from about 3300’ to 2700’. I was so content hiking along; the sun was shining through the leafless branches, birds were chirping and the temperature was comfortably cool. When we got to Stover Creek shelter, it was time for a late lunch. We all got so comfortable; we started tossing around the idea of staying there for the night. It was the usual hiker dilemma: too early to stop for the night, but……. such a nice spot to stay, complete with a water source and a privy. The ‘time’ factor won out, and we moved on, promising each other we would stop soon. We were rewarded for our decision by coming upon the best campsite ever, in my opinion! It was multi-faceted; it had a water source, trees for hammocks, flat spot for tent, branches for food bags and lots of bushes for privy use. What more could anyone ask for? (My sister would say “a Comfort Inn, please”). After getting our hammocks, etc. set up, I noticed Fran and Wild Thang collecting firewood. Hooray, we have a fire maker among us. Certificate and I joined in gathering firewood and sorting it into piles according to size. Didn’t I tell you these women were organized! Soon Fran had the fire blazing to warm us, while we warmed up our dinners. There is nothing like sitting around a campfire on a dark night with stars coming out and a crescent moon. This is why I like being outside in the woods.  Campfires have a mesmerizing, soothing effect and foster camaraderie. It was a wonderful opportunity to get to know each other better. Campfires also make you sleepy and I found I could hardly keep my eyes open. It was only 8 pm, but I trundled off to my hammock anyway. I saw Certificate head for hers shortly after, leaving Fran and Wild Thang to tend the fire. I read for a bit, and then drifted off to sleep, listening to the murmuring of their voices, the wind in the branches and the gentle babbling brook……….",,It's All About Me!,"Nov 16, Mon",0
Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520179,"I was the last one to get up this morning! It was just so enjoyable laying there in my hammock listening to the others moving around and preparing for the day. I also was in no hurry to exit my cozy sleeping bag. Temperatures last night were in the low 40s and I was warm and toasty. We didn't have much mileage to do today, around 4 miles or so, with Hawk Mountain shelter as our destination. Each trip I have taken since August has had its own special purpose. This trip was no exception. Besides my desire to get acquainted with the beginning of the trail, I also wanted to have leisurely days with a focus on getting to our campsite early and spending time learning how to efficiently set up and sleep in my hammock. There is definitely a learning curve involved. The early risers had collected our food bags from where they were hanging and brought them to the campfire area. I joined them and began cooking. Meals are pretty easy to make, as all I do is boil water. The water is then added to a Ziploc bag of oatmeal (complete with freeze dried fruit, a variety of nuts and spices) is set aside to cook. The extra water goes to making my big cup of tea. This is how I avoid cooking in my cook pot and having to scrub it out later. Morning chores completed, we loaded up and off we went.Remember yesterday I said we had a nice easy downhill walk to where we camped? Well that's always a bad thing for the following day because it means that you start off heading up, and up, and up even more. That was our day today we were gaining elevation as Hawk Mtn shelter is about 3200 feet. Again the trail was wide and very well marked. We crossed a number of streams on foot bridges, which is always preferable to rock hopping. Today was gray and a bit humid as the temperatures warmed. We began wondering about the possibility of rain. One of the interesting aspects of the trail today was high meadow areas. Fran, who is from around these parts, explained to me that these are grazing areas specifically created by the conservation people for feeding the wildlife, particularly deer. As we hiked my companions pointed out various potential campsites and water sources. Another feature of today's hike was taking a side trail to Long Creek Falls. It is a beautiful area and we sat, rested and enjoyed the beauty of the falls. Somehow that led to us eating lunch there even though it was shortly after breakfast! The falls are not far off from the main trail and I highly recommend checking it out.We continued on our journey, arduously ascending to the top of a ridge. By this time the clouds had darkened and noting that we suddenly had cell service, we all quickly checked our phones for messages and weather radar. Certificate’s husband had texted her to inform us of a major rainstorm headed our way. The storm was going to be in the area for at least 24 hours dumping a lot of rain, and having high winds. After a brief discussion, and being within a couple miles of our vehicle anyway, we decided to bolt. Fran offered the use of her family's primitive cabin nearby and it was unanimous. Yes, it was a no-brainer decision! That was a much better option than a shelter. Suddenly we began to move like gazelles, instead of the pack animals we previously resembled trudging uphill, and made it to the car in record time. We dropped Certificate off at her car back at the Springer parking area, as she had decided to head for home.Arriving at the cabin, we exploded our backpacks, took inventory of what food we had left to use for dinner and began setting about making ourselves cozy for the night. Fran got a fire going in the fire pit outside, which was under a roofed picnic area. Setting up chairs around it, we enjoyed our tea and listen to the rain which had begun to fall. It got heavier and heavier and the wind began to blow.   We were so thankful to be off the trail and sheltered in this beautiful location. Thank you Fran, for sharing this slice of heaven!

Today was to be our final day hiking out and returning to the Hiker Hostel. We are already out of the woods, so no hiking to be done. Next step was to return to the luxury of the hostel for a recuperative overnight. I had two days of driving ahead of me, going north to visit family and friends for Thanksgiving. Wild Thang and I have fallen into a wonderful pattern of taking an extra night at the end of a trip to rest and reflect, and this was no exception. But it was exceptionAL: we each had booked one of the Hostel’s shipping container rooms. I couldn’t wait to see what this was like. Fran drove us to the hostel and we parted ways vowing to hike together soon. As it was already 4 pm and still pouring, I bade Wild Thang goodnight and raced for my “container room” and she headed for hers, both of us armed with clean clothes and an intent to shower for hours! My room was beautiful and just the right size. It even had a kitchenette area. After cleaning up, I got comfy in the lounge chair, propping my feet up. With tea and cookies in hand, I sat staring out the sliding glass doors at the rain and thought how lucky I am to be here. It was so peaceful and serene I didn’t want to leave, so I didn’t. Yep, I stayed sequestered inside, enjoying every moment of the solitude. I made my dinner from meals that didn’t get eaten on the trail and polished off the remainder of my snacks, while reading on my Kindle (no TV).

We couldn’t have made a better decision than to leave the trail early. Wild Thang and I met at breakfast in the Hostel and chowed down once again. I was stoking up for a two day drive. At least that was the excuse I was using! Then I set off to nearby Mountain Crossings, an outfitter store and more at Neel Gap. Wild Thang and I had been there the previous day for a “look-around”. Having figured out that my current jacket was not going to work for March mountain weather, I was looking to purchase a warmer down jacket for my thru hike. I found one that fit my needs and haven’t taken it off even though it is only 45 degrees and rainy. It’s just so cozy.Mountain Crossing is well known for their backpack “shakedown”. I had had one done back in August, but had changed out tent for hammock and thought, well it doesn’t hurt to have another one done. With my backpack still loaded from 2 days ago, I headed inside. The staff was very welcoming and was happy to do the shakedown. I dumped everything out of every nook and cranny in the pack, dirty hiker clothes and all. Ugh. They must be used to this, because the young man helping me didn’t even wrinkle his nose! We discussed each and every item and the only thing he suggested was to not carry the small size fuel canister, but the next size up. My goal was to keep it under 28 pounds and I had succeeded.

Then I counted them, 44 in all, looked at my resupply sheet and saw that that is not even HALF of what I need. Oh woe is me! My friend Liz took me to Sam's Club, kindly held my hand as I hyperventilated, while purchasing great quantities (or so it seemed!)of supplies to create the variety of dinners and snacks needed. Once the panic passed, I started breathing again and decided to devote one whole week to meals,and hardly left the house.I set up an assembly line in the kitchen, lining up 10 to 15 ziplock bags at a time, filling each one with ingredients from one recipe. Then I moved on to the next recipe, etc. After 4 days, all the ingredients were gone and it was time to get out the vacuum packer/sealer. Best invention ever! Another two days with spent combining breakfasts and dinners and vacuum sealing them to correspond to each resupply point. Some took as little as three meals; others took a whopping 7 meals. Every pack was labeled with the location and date of arrival so hopefully there won't be any mishaps in putting it all into their shipping boxes.

I gotta quick get outta town before she figures it out I have had some inquiries about the food I have prepared, so I will address that now. My most valuable resource is a book by Chef Glenn McAllister called Recipes for Adventure. It is a wonderful compilation of dehydrating various foods, dehydrating meals, using store bought healthy alternatives and supplementing them and lots of recipes. I also found more healthy recipes online at The Yummy Life.com. I ordered dehydrated and freeze dried ingredients from Harmony House and my protein source of freeze dried diced chicken and ground beef came from Food Storage. I purchased cheese powder and tomato powder from another source which I can’t recall at the moment.Breakfast was easy to do. I am relying on oatmeal to which I added freeze dried fruit (apples, peaches, cherries or apricots), nuts, spices, powdered milk. To give myself a break during the warmer months, I packed store bought breakfast bars. Lunch definitely lacks variety as I am relying on packets of almond butter and jam, tuna packets with mayo packet added, and pepperoni using whole wheat tortillas as the bread. To increase the calorie count and to ease the boredom of the lunches, I have added Mounds bars, KitKats and Peppermint patties, all dark chocolate. Those should get me over the next mountain.

Spanish rice with tomatoes and beefAll are meals prepared in the freezer quart zip lock bags to which I only have to add boiling water and let them sit.

I am so fortunate to be joined by my wonderful hiking friends, all Trail Dames extraordinaire. Wild Thang kindly transported me from Atlanta, Fran is driving us to the Springer parking lot, hiking to the summit with us, and Crumpet came from So. Carolina to hike with me for the week! The morning had a leisurely pace to it as we waited for the hostel to clear out before packing up. Packs loaded we headed to Springer. With Fran's car there, we were able to leave our heavy packs in the car while we hiked south .9 miles to the Springer Mountain summit. It was a wonderful warm up for the legs and lungs. At the top, there is a metal drawer inserted into a big rock. Inside the drawer is a notebook where hikers log in. I signed in with date and time, we took pictures and back down we went to retrieve our packs from the car.Today is a beautiful sunny day, in the 60's. Since today was designed to be leisurely, we lunched in a sunny spot in the parking lot before saying goodbye to Fran. Our packs were heavy (30 lbs) but the trail was wide and easy on the feet, so it was an enjoyable hike to our first overnight spot by a creek. Arriving about 3:30, we had time to gather firewood after setting up, and Crumpet soon had a fire blazing. This is a great location where we had camped in November, so it felt like home. In spite of being in familiar territory, it was a relatively sleepless night.Here's a funny tidbit: after having lunch at the parking lot, we met two men who, just arriving, were looking for directions to the top of Springer Mt. They were also thru hikers, age 78! We were chatting with one of them, while I was putting on my pack (I was having a very ungraceful moment, regardless of having done this many times before). Dollar (the man's trail name) watched me, then said: "" I have a much better way to put the pack on and I insist on showing you"". Really?? I must have appeared terribly helpless. I quickly dissuaded him of his notion and suggested he enjoy carrying his own pack to the top and back down, whereas we were smart enough to have a car to leave them in!Ha ha. Off we set, wondering if they would catch up to us.","Springer Mountain, GA

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525076,"It took a while to get going this morning, it was just so peaceful by the creek. Wild Thang had gotten the food bags down from the tree in the hopes of moving us along, but it was not to be. After lollygagging, we finally left about 11 am! Off we set for Long Creek falls for our first break spot. It is a beautiful area off the trail just a bit, and well worth the walk. In my previous entries, I have posted a picture. While there we met another thru hiker, Horn, who was taking her time heading north while she worked on her novel. Such interesting people on the trail! The hike today was enjoyable and what made it even more so was the fact that Fran was meeting us at our destination, Horse Gap to join us for camping overnight. She was also bringing dinner!! Cooking it for us! Chicken fajitas, salad, avocados, and all sorts of yummy stuff that no hiker wants to carry. It was to be a feast. Also she was bringing the all important water, as there is none to be had at this particular gap.While waiting for Fran to arrive, we had a chance to look around, and it was not appealing. There were few flat spots for tents and it was very windy. Fran arrived and had 3 suggestions: camp here, drive down the road a bit to a different site, or go to her primitive (no electric or running water) cabin nearby, where we had been fortunate enough to visit in November. Well, the minute she said ""cabin"" our eyes lit up and the smiles returned. Off we went, and in 40 minutes were settled in the cabin for the night. Soon a delicious dinner was laid out and the feasting began. We ate on the porch looking at the mountain we had just hiked up and down the other side. I was feeling pretty smug looking at it! As darkness fell, Fran got a fire going in the campfire ring. I was way too tired to join them and went to bed. I had a great night sleep. Trail Angel Fran, I thank you so much! But the magic doesn't end here...","Stealth camp site

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525083,"after a great night's sleep, I was raring to go, but who could pass up sitting on the porch with my morning cuppa tea. So that is what I did. Shortly, I smelled bacon cooking, oh my! I went inside, and Fran was once again outdoing herself in the kitchen: mounds of bacon, scrambled eggs, muffins, fresh fruit, cheese, and on and on. Ohhh. Wanting to be polite, I loaded my plate and we all dined on the porch enjoying the great food and view. Gosh, it was hard to pack up and leave, but that is what we did, and Fran dropped Crumpet and me back at Horse Gap. Wild Thang was headed off to other obligations and it was hard to say goodbye to both of them. Another late start, 11 am, but we booked it up the first big climb up Sassafras Mtn, at 3347 feet elevation, making good time. Today involved a few climbs, which I enjoy. Downhill is what I dislike, as it is hard on the knees. As we were threading our way down to Justus Creek, we heard voices. Hikers were gathered on the far side, having a break. As I carefully made my way down the ""steps"", while eyeballing the route across the creek. There were large rocks to step on, but didn't look very steady. Suddenly a voice called out ""Would you like me to carry your pack across for you?"" I looked up, a a young man was about to leap across the stones to assist me, so I said, well, if you insist! Over he came, shouldered my pack like it was jacket, and flew back across. Wow! I carefully minced my was across, balancing carefully, thinking how wise to practice this without the pack weight.I thanked him profusely, and sank to the ground to rest and have a snack. Crumpet, being younger and more experienced, crossed easily as well. It turned out that the young man, Vlad, was there with three other people providing trail magic to hikers, in the form of hot coffee and Snickers bars. It was fun to watch more hikers come through and their eyes light up at the thought of coffee and candy! Since we had miles to go,Crumpet bounced up as I slowly got to my feet. As I straightened, Vlad again offered to carry my back up a ways (""stairs again"") and being older and wiser, I gratefully accepted!He bounced a ways up the hill until I said, far enough. Then he held it like a coat for me to shrug on. I was laughing the entire time, and the crowd decided to change my trail name to ""Princess"" CuppaTea. Fine with me!Rain is in the forecast, and Crumpet and I made haste for our stop for the night. We got there in time to set up while it sprinkled, then it really came down hard. We sat under my tarp and watched the rain, and much to my consternation, watched the drips coming thru some of the stitching holes I had sealed. I was not a happy camper. But it was the first time it had been wet, and later the dripping stopped.   Our hanging the food bags routine was comical, and took me 6 tries to heave that rock up and over a branch, but we got it done, and went to bed. It was a miserable cold, rainy, windy night, but I was warm and comfy.","Horse Gap

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525095,"Last night, resting comfortably, listening to the rain on the tarp while wishing I could fall asleep, there was a HUGE crash in the woods nearby! It sounded like a tree had fallen, or had a bear messed with the tree where we had hung our food bags? I listened carefully, but didn't hear any snuffing, twigs breaking or other suspicious noises so I put my ear plugs in and finally fell asleep. After all, it was cold and rainy, not a nice night for bears carousing! In the morning, I went to retrieve the bags from their hanging spot and lo and behold, there they were laying on the ground! No, no bear, just two dumb hikers who had chosen a dead branch to hang all that weight! Thankfully, they were untouched and I brought them back to camp, laughing at the errors of our ways!Crumpet and I were a little more organized this morning and managed to leave camp by 10:30 am. Uphill we went immediately to the top of Ramrock Mtn, which offered wonderful views of the mountains in the distance. As we moved along, we were passed by many of the hikers we saw yesterday. The majority had stopped at an earlier shelter than we did and had gotten an early start. It was fun to see everyone and exchange rainy night woes. After Ramrock, it was a nice easy downhill into Woody Gap, a major parking area and trail crossing. A couple and their grandkids were providing trail magic in the form of pop, cookies and candy. I indulged in a couple of cookies to supplement my lunch and Crumpet and I set up on comfy benches in the sun to eat, while airing out our feet and sun drying socks and shoes. After lunch there was nothing else to do but head uphill again, summiting Big Cedar Mtn at 3737 feet. It was a steep uphill climb, but again the views made it worth it, as well as knowing that it was going to be a 2 mile roller downhill all the way to Lance Creek. What an interesting area. The creek runs between two hills (steep, and big) and there is camping there for supposedly 4 tents. However, everywhere the eye could see, tents were perched on not so flat spots, hammocks hung on hillsides and people everywhere. There had to be at least 50 people here tonight. We walked in quite a ways and found ourselves in a flat area that already had 6 tents pitched, wall to wall. There was one spot left, which Crumpet took, and I headed down a small incline to two perfect hammock trees. I just needed to be careful when I stepped out, not to slide right down hill!! Our area was populated by a couple in their late 50's and a handful of young women, all out hiking alone, or with a friend or with a dog. We all got along well, and conversed over dinner. One even was carrying a ukelele and played for us. Her trail name has become ""Ukelady"". Very apropos. All had masters degrees, and were out hiking for a variety of reasons. In spite of all the people and conversations echoing off the hillsides, when dark fell, everyone went to bed. It was 8 pm. I slept the best yet on the trail, comforted by being surrounded by all sorts of people. Tomorrow we take on the challenge of Blood Mountain,4457 feet!! Weather has improved, sunny and 65 ish. Hiking in short sleeves.","Gooch Gap campsites

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525100,"What a great night sleep. I even was up before it got light and started packing up and getting organized. Everyone was rustling around anyway, so there would be no sleeping in. It was a social breakfast around the campfire ring, while I ate and watched the young'uns pack up and get moving. Soon Crumpet and I were the last to depart, but it was the earliest yet: 9:30 am. We knew we had a big day ahead of us, but it was going to end back at Hiker Hostel for shower and overnight, so that is strong motivation to get going. It was a cool, gray day and we kept working our way up one small mountain, down into a gap, up another, down to a gap and up another, all the while gaining in elevation. The temperature kept dropping, so at least we didn't overheat. At one point we stopped to filter water so as not to have to carry so much from the start. As we approached the top, I had to take a break and take off my boots. One foot was stinging and I wanted to attend to any blister forming. As we sat and doctored my feet 3 young girls came hustling down from above. When they saw us, they stopped to ask questions about our packs and plans. They were impressed with the size of the packs and wondered what they weighed. When I told them it was now much lighter, having eaten 4 days of food and it was down to 26 lbs. The smallest one of them wanted to see what it felt like, so I invited her to pick it up. I think the pack weighed more than she did. Then her two friends each took a turn slinging it on and exclaimed over the weight factor. Then they made us feel really wonderful by telling us how awesome they thought we were for what we were doing. Awwwww. gosh, that made it all worthwhile. It didn't make us get to the top faster, but it was a heck of a lot more fun!Unfortunately once on top, it was so foggy and misty you couldn't see the best views that elevation has to offer. Since it was chilly up there and we had a hot shower to race towards we started down. Oh my! Big boulders to go over, rock faces to walk upon and hope not to slip, and then the sprinkles started. Can't go any faster as it wouldn't be safe, so we just persevered and kept plugging along, being passed by day hikers and thru hikers alike. Now the rain was steady and we were just so close to Neel's gap that we didn't want to stop and rain suit up. So here's a lesson learned: always stop and cover up, because you just never know how long it is going to take to get to cover. Happily I was wearing my wool top and it kept me warm in spite of being wet. Our ride came shortly after we arrived at the Gap and whisked us off to the Hostel. Ahhh, long hot shower, dinner in town and back to find our 4 person bunk room inhabited by two young men with whom we were apparently sharing the room.The rest of the night was spent watching them fuss with their packs and discussing their plans. One was very prepared and informed and the other lacked preparation. Due to my sore feet and body fatigue, plus the forecast of a rainy Easter Sunday, I decided to take a zero day at the hostel to rest and prepare for the next section. Once again, age and wisdom rule!","Lance Creek campsites

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526667,"What a great morning, watching everyone else packing up to head to Springer and the start of their hike. The nervous anticipation was palpable. Soon they all loaded up and headed out and the hostel quieted down. I worked on chores: laundry, sorting food supply, etc., drank more tea than I should have. Once laundry was done Crumpet drove us to Mountain Crossings so I could make my purchases, as I needed new insoles for my boots. Superfeet to the rescue. The store was teeming with soggy wet hikers, as it is also the location of the hostel. The weather is so miserable, cold and rainy. No one is inclined to hike. It was a brilliant idea to take the day off!After shopping we headed into Dahlonega with lunch in mind. There was an old tavern that intrigued us so we checked out their menu and didn't leave until we were stuffed! My shrimp and grits disappeared quickly and Crumpet made quick work of her bowl of gumbo. Returning to the Hiker Hostel, it was time to bid farewell to Crumpet, who needed to return to real life. It was the moment I was dreading as it meant I was about to face the reality of solo hiking. Feeling morose, I headed inside to finish preparing for tomorrow, while trying to quiet the little nagging voice calling out ""take another zero!"". The only solution was to have a cup of tea and reassess how I was truly feeling; physically, mentally and emotionally.Late in the afternoon, the newbies starting arriving, struggling thru the door of the hostel with bulging packs of 40, 50, 60 lbs. Seeing them and interacting with them them throughout the evening I began to realize how much I have learned already and that I needed to continue on.I reworked my next week, adding an extra day of food, so I could decrease my daily mileage and felt confident it was doable without struggling.

I chatted with some of the newbies over breakfast, knowing they would soon be racing by me down the trail. I was dropped back off at Neel Gap and after fussing with water and a bathroom break I headed uphill. Alone. As I climbed, looking for white blazes, I had moments of panic. There were no blazes in sight. Fret, fret. Keep climbing. Soon I was close to the top and yay, there was a blaze. Whew! Feeling much better, I moseyed along, trying to slow my pace and look around. The views were gorgeous, mountains and ridges everywhere. When I got to the top of Wolf Laurel Mtn there was a wonderful grassy area to sit in the sun and look across the valley to the other ridges. Since I had planned a leisurely day, I did some yoga stretches, ate my lunch and enjoyed the peace and quiet. One more mile to my camp for the night and it was an easy roll downhill to a gap, the Baggs Creek area. Now I am settled in, fetched and filtered water and made myself a big cuppa tea to wash down my snacks. It's 5:45 pm and I have company for the night, two college students from Dartmouth, Nick and Perri, and Elizabeth, a young woman who also stayed at the Hostel Saturday night.

They scurried around packing up as it was so cold and windy. By 8:30 the sun was shining and starting to warm up the day. I got all packed up, except my tarp, as I wanted to sit under it as a wind break while I cooked my breakfast. It was very peaceful listening to the birds and enjoying the view. Finally I got moving up the trail. It was very kind today, not too rocky and only a couple of serious climbs. I made good time and arrived at Low Gap Shelter around 3 pm. Lots of folks are here already, so I set up on a hill up from the shelter where the ""mature"" crowd seem to gravitate. Next order of business is a cup of tea and snack. Soon we were all getting acquainted around the fire ring. Bobby and Robin, from Kentucky, Elizabeth arrived, two young men from Nova Scotia and a man from Indiana.

There were some rocky sections to tackle and a wicked steep climb up to the top of Blue Mountain at 3880 ft. elevation.

The plan today was to race down the mountain to the Gap and get a shuttle into Hiawassee for resupply and overnight.It was so foggy out it was hard to find the way, and was eerie walking down the trail. There were no views to be had, due to the fog, so I concentrated on my footing trying not to slip on wet rocks and roots. It was a long 2.5 mile downhill and just seemed endless. Suddenly someone was approaching, coming up the trail. It was Bill, a ridgerunner, who was headed for the Blue Mtn. shelter for the day and night. Ridgerunners oversee the trail, make sure everyone is safe and following the ""Leave no Trace"" rules, etc. We chatted a bit and he said I was close to the bottom.

I found a nice spot to sit on a rock, overlooking a valley, in the sun, out of the wind. Yes, still windy! There were a few close mountains, but mostly you could see across a long valley, filled with farmland, and a town in the distance. Very pretty.Tray mountain was the next big climb for the day, one mile of straight up, to 4430 ft. elevation. It got colder, more damp and foggy by the time I hit the top. Then down a bit to the shelter and in for the night. Elizabeth is here, as is Jax from NH. Others came in as the evening went on and we number 12 in all.It was tough hiking today, physically as usual, but more mentally. I just didn't want to do it.

I got down my food bag from the bear cables and took it to the shelter to make breakfast out of the wind. A group came in last night and there were hammocks hanging everywhere around the shelter. It is funny to go to bed at night with one or two other tents or hammocks and then wake up, look out and see that many more sprouted up overnight! The group was two families, with kids ranging in age from 10-16. They were all quite cold as they did not have equipment for this kind of cold weather. We all chatted over breakfast, then they packed up and took off, as they had to be back to their car by Sunday and back to work/school on Monday. It's so nice to not have such a schedule!!I got out of camp by 10 am and lo and behold, the trail went downhill! Of course you know that means trouble ahead in the form of many climbs. As I am climbing I am wondering if I am getting any stronger yet. I feel slower than ever on the uphills, but I am at 3600-4400 ft elevation. The air is a little thin up here for a Florida flatlander! Overall, I am making good time to the shelters at night and I am not wiped out when I arrive. Maybe those factors are better indicators of conditioning than my rate of plodding uphill. I am also sleeping much better, so I wake up feeling rested and ready to go. My feet are holding up well. No blisters at all, just calluses building up. Some days I tape them, other days I don't. I have become a big fan of Body Glide, a dry lubricant, that I put on my feet, and on the outside of my liner socks so the thick outside sock slides as well. Anything to reduce the friction in the feet is a good thing!Ther are big winds today, 20-25 mph. Walking the last ridge today I almost got myself into trouble. I was wearing my t-shirt and a headband over my ears and thought, huh, I am getting cold. But it's only a little further to the shelter and if I stop to put on layers, I will freeze and it will take too long. This conversation went on and on until I realized, this is how people die of hypothermia! I threw down my pack, layered up and started hiking again, thinking wow, I am toasty now. How stupid is that. And of course, the shelter is NEVER as close as you think it is, so I was glad I stopped to put on warmer clothes.Deep Gap shelter was thankfully on the lee side of the mountain so when I rounded the ridge and started the downhill into the gap, it was like another world. Calm, sunny, warm. No howling gales. You could actually hear yourself think! I got to the shelter and found a nice spot down below it, even more out of the wind. After I got set up, Elizabeth arrived and was followed by many others. Bill, the ridgerunner I previously met on Blue Mt. was there for the night as well. Odie and Gray Beard came in followed by Great Gramps and FarMore, from California. It is nice to have company my own age. Mark aka Ginger arrived as did John and Amy, both from GA, but Amy went to school at RIT so we commiserated about the pitfalls of snow and cold weather. It was a nice group of people that had been leapfrogging past each other all day.

The ridgerunner, Bill, spied a ziplock bag of trash someone had left in the fire ring. It was not there last night, so it was a morning deposit. He looked it over, and saw it had a tag from a Copper Spur I tent in it. We all looked around and down by me was the tent. Bill went over to talk to the young man whose trash it was. When asked why he wasn't packing it out like we are supposed to, his answer was: I thought someone might want it. WHAT?????Who would want your trash. He took it back and hopefully was embarrassed enough to pack it out and not just dump it somewhere else when no one was looking. Trash on the AT is a serious issue and most people are good about leaving no trace. However, there are multiple toilet paper ""blossoms"" planted behind trees or dumped by the trailside. It is such a shame. After all it really takes very little effort to bury the TP in the dirt and leaves to decompose.Three big climbs today were on the to do list! First up, Powell Mtn. That was a nice climb and resulted in good view. Then Buzzard Knob went up to 3679 feet almost straight up. It was difficult and required lots of little rest stops and many mantras to keep going. The mantra went like this:""suck it up, your pack is light. Suck it up, your legs are strong. Suck it up and just climb this hill"". Repeat over and over again with appropriate breathing. Now, it is true that my pack was lighter as I was down to 2 days food, and very little water. And it is true that my legs are stronger. And I DID have to climb that hill. So, sometimes you just have to kick yourself in the butt and get motivated any way you can. I finally got to PlumOrchard Shelter and I was whipped. 8.1 miles was my longest day so far and I was feeling it. The shelter was beautiful, large and a double decker, meaning it had a loft. I found a nice spot nearby and set up my hammock and tarp and got into my ""evening sleep clothes"". Then it was time for dinner and the usual routine of tea, then EmergenC drink, then whey protein powder drink, then dinner, then hang the food bag (thank heavens for bear cables, which make this chore 'bearable' (haha) and easy. Only when that is all done, can I go to bed. I have been trying to do this writing online each day, but with cold fingers, and lack of good reception it is just not possible yet. All the more reason to take zero days to catch up!

Had my delicious oatmeal and cup of hot tea and was ready to sashay down the trail. Only guess what? I can't find my way outta here! Truly. I got to the creek, where I got my water yesterday, before climbing up steps to the shelter. Came down the same way, veered to the left where there was camping space, wandered around looking for the trail, found none. Huh! I know it's here somewhere. Ok, not time to panic yet. Stay calm, breathe. It can't be that hard. It is NOT hiding. Many feet have worn down the path. Where oh where is it. Time to press SOS on my SpotGen3? No, this is not an emergency. It feels like an emergency. Breathe. Well, heck. Ok, backtrack to the creek and start over. So I did. Got to the creek. Stood on the little log bridge and looked around. OH MY! THERE is the blue blaze, over on the right, up a little narrow trail. For some reason, I had just followed the biggest path of least resistance and ended up in the tenting area. Laughing at myself, feeling foolish, I headed up the trail to meet up with the AT. You will be happy to know I did not hesitate when I turned RIGHT onto the AT. At least I have that direction figured out. Such an auspicious start to the day!Today is special because the trail takes me across the GA/NC state line. See the picture above. I stopped for a picture, as did many, so we took turns taking each other's picture. Since my phone was low, I had been charging it with the charger, kept in the very top pocket of my pack, affectionately called the ""top brain"". I sat on the big rock where I had plopped my pack, wormed my way into the straps and gave a big heave ho forward to stand up. As I did so, that stupid heavy charger pack came flying out, smashed into the back of my head and flew to the ground. Ow,ow.ow. It made a big lump on my head. After saying a few choice words, I then thought, well that'll teach you to not zip up your brain! Fortunately a young man was there with me, having just had his picture taken by me, and he retrieved the charger and stuffed it back where it belonged. I must say, I was grateful it hadn't flown down the steep hill where it would have been difficult to retrieve.
Ten yards down the trail was Bly Gap, a nice open area that had a creek running thru it. A handful of hikers were already on lunch break, enjoying being out of the wind and lounging in the sun. Many Waters arrived before me and Tinkerbell and Quest came in as I ate. I dropped my pack, sat down on my tyvek sheet and took off my boots and socks. Ahhh, bliss. I try to do this each lunch break as it is important to keep feet and socks dry. Plus it feels good to massage the old dogs and check for blisters and rub spots. I must say, I got a bit too comfortable, enjoying the sun and resting. An hour went by and it was time to filter some water and get going up the steep hill behind me. At the top of said hill is a very old twisted up oak tree that is supposedly the most photographed tree on the trail. Keeping my phone handy, I started up, and up and up. Finally, there it was, so it had its picture taken once again, which I will post on tomorrow's log.
The trail today was more comfortable than yesterday's endless climbs. My mantra today was more along the line of giving thanks to He who creates all.Even with the hour lunch break, I arrived in the shelter area in time to enjoy a cup of tea before dinner. One Step, from Utah, was there and was delighted to be offered a tea bag. As we boiled water, we caught up on each other's hike and future plans. He is headed to the NOC to zero and watch his daughter compete in the kayaking trials. That should be a fun time. The NOC is the Nantahala Outdoor Center and offers canoeing and kayaking classes, competitions, etc. I will also be staying overnight there soon.Bobby, aka Whistler, from NJ came in as dinner preparations were underway. He exploded his pack, covering the entire shelter floor, while looking for something. Then he was in a panic when he couldn't find his sleeping pad for tonight. It would be a hard cold floor night for him, but then it rolled out of the bottom of his pack. One Step threw up a bear line, as there were no cables here, and invited me to hang my bag. I gratefully took him up on his offer, even though I have an Ursak, which only needs to be tied to a tree. But when there is a line or cable available, I like to use them, as it discourages rodent damage as well.
The sun set behind the mountain ridge in front of us and the temperature dropped immediately. I bid the men goodnight and retired to my hammock to read and warm up. It is 7:30pm. Love this early bedtime!","PlumOrchard Shelter

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526717,"I was eager to get up and get going this morning knowing that I only had 4 miles to hike, most of it down hill into the Deep Gap area where there is a service road with parking. I had made arrangements with a trail Angel to pick me up there and shuttle me into Franklin, where I was to pick up my resupply boxes. My intent had been to stay at the Budget Inn in Franklin a poor relation to the Budget Inn Hiawassee. Since my experience there was so miserable I had booked myself a room at the Comfort Inn instead, and was looking forward to a night in luxury! Instead wonderful Trail Angels by the name of Chris and Diane changed my plans for the better.
I was hiking downhill and suddenly came across an interesting situation. A very large tree had fallen across the trail bringing down a smaller narrow tree with it. I got up close and saw that there was some space underneath to crawl under it if one was small and without a giant backpack on one's back. or I could try and climb over this enormous double trunk tree. In sizing up the situation I decided that the tree was actually like two large horses. I could throw one leg over,straddle it, then slide off, as there was enough room in between the fork of it to put a leg down then slide the other leg over, standing in between, then repeat the process over the next trunk. I was hoping as I did this maneuver that the weight of my pack would not pull me over backwards and down the steep side of the mountain. Thankfully my years of training with Carol Kozlowski riding horses paid off and I got across both tree safely and was on to the third challenge. The narrow tree was higher off the ground, so no climbing over it. Not enough room to kneel down and crawl either. After giving it a good look over I realized I could grab it with both arms and swing myself underneath it like a monkey, hoping that there was enough room for my body and my pack between the tree and the ground or I would surely get stuck. Wrapping both arms around the tree I swung mightily, clearing it with an inch to spare. Standing up I dusted myself off, grabbed my hiking poles and said ""nothing can stop me from my zero day off!"". 
I could tell I was getting close to my destination as the trail leveled out and became easier walking. I looked up and suddenly noticed a day hiker approaching. I stopped to chat and discovered it was no ordinary day hiker but my trail angel Chris. He had gotten there early and had walked up to meet me. Also down at his truck he had set up a wonderful Trail magic for hikers passing through. He urged me to hurry on down, have a seat in the chair and indulge in hiker treats. He was going to continue a bit further up the trail to see how things were looking and would return shortly. I did as I was told and gratefully sank into a real chair! I kicked off my boots, and heaved a sigh of relief knowing that good things were in store. Mountain Mike and Many Waters were also sitting there enjoying Chris's Trail Magic. He had a cooler of Gatorade, lemonade and water and many snacks and cookies and graham crackers. Many Waters was considering going into Franklin as well, but decided to move on down the trail. Mountain Mike was hoping to get a ride with Chris into Franklin as he needed to do some Banking and resupply. 
When Chris returned, he was happy to give him a ride and we packed up all the trail magic supplies, squeezed into the truck and headed for Franklin. After dropping Mountain Mike off, Chris took me out to lunch at the Frogtown Market. Oh, that turkey reuben disappeared rapidly. So tasty. We chatted while we ate and got acquainted. Then it was off to pick up my resupply boxes at the Budget Inn. Before I knew it, we were pulling up to Chris and Diane's beautiful home in Franklin. I was shown to the guest suite downstairs and exploded my pack, piling up laundry to do and sorting through my food bag. There were chores to be done but first off was a nice long hot shower! Chris assured me they had a 90 gallon hot water tank and I was to use as much of it as I needed, and I needed a lot! Taking a shower after so many days without one is exhausting work. The only thing I had energy left to do was hobble upstairs and make a cup of tea. I join Chris out on their beautiful screen porch which overlooks part of the golf course in the mountains in the distance. Soon Diane came home from her errands and we discovered we had much in common. We both grew up in the Buffalo/Grand Island area, their daughter's name is Danielle and she is 29 and my son's name is Daniel and he is 29. They also have a son Cameron who is 27, lives nearby and is a pharmacy technician. It was fun to discover such similarities over dinner in a Mexican restaurant. When we got back to the house I bid them goodnight as I could hardly keep my eyes open. I took another nice hot shower, just because I could, and crawled into a real bed. Ahhh, it is so wonderful to be clean and warm and inside. Thank you my wonderful Trail Angels!","Muskrat Creek

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526743,"It is such a wonderful to take a zero day and boy, does the time pass quickly. After a great night's sleep I was ready to tackle more hiker chores. Laundry got done, followed by a big sort and repack of food for the next few days. Water filter got flushed, dirty water bags rinsed, and so on and so forth. Then it was time to catch up on my trail journal, but I had to have a little snooze first!Keeping up with the journal is difficult because of the cold weather (frozen fingers trying to type) and lack of cell signal. I am hoping that it will get easier to do daily as the weather warms up. Right now I have to do a written entry in my notebook, then transcribe when I have access to a computer. (Thank you Diane, for the use of your laptop!)I had a special treat tonight to cap off the best zero days yet. The North Carolina Symphony was in Franklin to give a concert, and I got to attend. It was a full house, 1500 people and the program was familiar; William Tell Overture, music from Romeo and Juliet, selections from the opera Carmen and a Czech piece that was unknown to me. Also joining the Symphony tonight was a pianist, age 17, who was amazing. Lots of wonderful music made better by the company of my Trail Angels and their extended family. They have been so gracious and taken excellent care of me these two days, I just can't thank them enough. Tomorrow I return to the trail, jumping ahead a bit to Tellico Gap. I am skipping a section that I did already this year and will keep me on schedule to arrive in the Smokies in time to meet up with Crumpet. It will be difficult to leave this piece of Heaven, but I must move on or I will never get to Maine!The picture today is of the oft photographed old and twisted tree above Bly Gap.","Deep Gap

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526984,"Oh my, was it difficult to leave the comfort of my trail angels' home and get back to the trail. Chris kindly shuttled me up to Tellico Gap. After depositing me at the Trailside he provided Trail Magic for some hiker sitting and having lunch. It was fun to see familiar faces. Nick and Perry were there as well as Bushwacker whom I had last seen weeks ago while hiking with Crumpet. We spent a minute catching up on where everybody had been and how there is zero days were in Franklin before shouldering are packed and heading immediately uphill. The high today was short and windy, as usual. This wind just does not want to give up. Dark clouds were forming off in the distance and we were all moving along quickly to get to the shelter before it rained. It was relatively painless getting there, I'm pleased to say and I was able to get almost set up before the rain and sleet hit. Hikers kept pouring in and quickly filled the shelter. Tarps were set up across the openings to help break the wind for the night. We all huddled inside cooking on any flat surface we could find while trying to keep warm as the temperature dropped. Two brave souls attempted to get a campfire going in spite of the wind and rain and were successful! I stood around the campfire for a bit chatting with the others as we discussed just how low the temperature would be going that night and how much snow we might encounter when we woke up in the morning. That in itself was enough to drive me into my hammock well before dark. Surprisingly as the evening wore on, the wind calmed down and the rain petered off. The temperature hovered at a raw 36 degrees. None the less I slept well, looking forward to tomorrow's hike downhill into the Nantahala Outdoor Center.","Tellico Gap

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526985,"Needless to say it was cold and sprinkling this morning when I woke up. This seems to be a pattern unfortunately. I brought my clothes into my sleeping bag to warm them up while I plotted out my morning routine. I decided this time to get dressed, pack up and then make breakfast since the rain had stopped and my tarp was beginning to dry out. The sky was cloudy and looking like it might rain some more so it was best to get things wrapped up and under cover just in case. I think I'm getting a little smarter about all of this!I join the others in the shelter and made my breakfast while watching the packing up activities. We all had to shuffle and juggle around each other as there were at least 12 people moving about in a very small space. Having down my oatmeal and my Cuppa tea I threw my backpack on and headed up the trail. I was surprised when I checked my watch and found it was only 9:15 a.m.! Yay, a semi-early start!On the map the majority of the trail looked to be downhill. But of course in order to go downhill, one must first go uphill and that I did. What a spectacular view there was at the top looking out over the valley and mountains in the distance. The picture above probably doesn't do it justice, as the Sun was shining way off in the distance on the mountains and up close it was dark and cloudy, making for a wonderful contrast. Part of The Descent was very Rocky and some of it required actually sitting down on a huge Rock and sliding a bit until my feet reach the ground. A little unnerving but I keep thinking about all of the people's who have done this before me and survived, so I keep on going.Once past the rocky part the trailhead nice long stretches of good footing and you could make some good time lengthening your stride and moving right along. It felt good to stretch the legs out without worrying about tripping and falling. Before I knew it I was down too 1900 feet and the NOC. I had reserved a bunk for the night to get out of the cold and wet which wasn't going to be available until 3 p.m. There is a river lodge restaurant here so I joined other hikers for a late lunch. It was so wonderful to sit down and eat a meal without freezing!Lots of the hiker I have seen the last two days are here as well and there is wonderful camaraderie. I am currently sitting in the community building which is heated,working on my journal and soaking up as much heat as my body will allow, hoping it will stay with me tomorrow as I climb to 4600 feet and a 24 degree night.

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527593,"Surprisingly I didn't' sleep that well last night. I even had my own room with a door that locked, so no bears could get in. Guess I missed the comfort of my hammock. Nice to have flush toilets and showers though. Having the little room to myself I was able to spread my tarp out to dry late yesterday afternoon. In doing so, I noticed that one of the little O rings on the tarp ridge line had opened up, probably a result of the strong winds . Fortunately Pebbles was there (met her camping at Lance Creek previously, hiking with Heisenberg,her college roommate) and she was the proud owner of a huge and weighty Leatherman tool. When she saw my problem, she got out the tool and SoLow used his strength and nimble fingers to pry the ring back into useable shape. Problem solved thanks to these wonderful hikers.I could delay no longer as checkout was at 10 am, so looking at the map and sighing, I headed uphill. It was to be a full day of climbing. I actually enjoyed the day, as the climbs that are stretched out over 6 miles are more tolerable than going straight up. At one point, I passed a memorial plaque set into a rock, honoring Wade Sutton, a NC firefighter who gave his life in 1968, at that spot fighting forest fire. Below the plaque on the ground were many offerings from those passing by: coins, bracelets, candles and the like. I paused to admire the tribute being paid to him before continuing on. You never know what you will find in these mountains! The climb took me from 1732' to 4391' and you could feel the temperature change. I finally rolled into the Sassafras shelter area and set up quickly, trying to keep warm. There is a nice group here tonight, SprinkleToes, Crisco, Bushwacker to name some. Lately we have all been doing the same mileage and ending up together at night. This will likely continue into Fontana Dam. Bedtime came early,7:30pm, mostly to get warm! Going down to 26 degrees, but no reports of precipation, thank heavens. I may have to resort to using my hand warmer packets as a heat source ..........","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527598,"Woke up today with a sense of dread. Not only was it freezing out, but I knew that today I would be faced with my highest mileage yet, 9.1, and had to do a huge steep climb right at the end of the day. I got going with leadened boots and started up out of the shelter area, climbing Cheoah Bald. Once to the top, threading my way through the rocks, I came upon SoLow, who was having his breakfast while admiring the incredible views. What a great idea! I hope to be able to do that at some point, but certainly not until it is much warmer in the mornings! We chatted a bit, then I continued on, coming out onto the flat grassy area of the bald. Goner and Wooby had camped here last night and they awoke to a spectacular view. As we all looked around, hikers drifted in and around taking pictures and gabbing. You wouldn't think there would be much to say since we were all at the shelter together this morning, chatting around the fire. Somehow hikers manage to find common ground, even if it to discuss at depth the previous 100 feet of trail just traversed!The elevation is now 5000' and it was time to descend. Once past the rocks, it was good footing and I was able to move along rapidly, dropping down 1000' or so into Stecoah Gap, where there is a highway road crossing. This also means a way to bail out and get into a town, thus avoiding Jacobs Ladder! Down at the gap, there were picnic tables and trash cans. I know it seems a little odd to get excited about trash cans, but you need to realize that we are all being good responsible hikers, and carrying out all our trash, which in our minds gains weight the longer we carry it! A trash can means you can lighten your pack weight by a whopping few ounces, before a big climb. I, for one, was excited to drop my trash! On the picnic table, a trail angel had left a bunch of apples, set up in the shape of the AT symbol, as well as some bananas. Yum. I downed a banana, then got out my lunch and proceeded to eat. In the meantime, White Noise, a young Brit, offered to go fill water containers, and I gratefully accepted, as my legs were so tired. I rewarded him with a KitKat, which pleased him, so it was a good barter. Now it was time to tackle the biggie. Jacob's ladder is a .5 mile straight uphill. No switchbacks, no steps, or log assists, just a plain dirt path up to the sky. 10 steps rest, 10 steps swear, 5 steps begging for mercy, and so it went. It took 45 minutes to go one half mile and my legs felt like jelly at the top. Once there, a rocky knob had to be climbed, then it was coast downhill to the shelter.What a relief to get to camp, look at my watch and see that I made good time today. Have I finally developed hiker legs? It was good to see familiar faces again tonight, it's beginning to feel like family. Sprinkle toes, Crisco and Bushwacker were in the shelter and applauded my approach. As I threw myself onto the floor, trying to disengage my pack, I asked where the water was. Sprinkle toes replied that it was down the hill where there was a nice flowing Creek. When I groaned loudly, she offered to go fetch water for me as she had been sitting there in the shelter for a couple of hours and felt the need for some exercise. Can you imagine? This young woman hikes 9 miles,carrying an enormous pack, in a relatively short time, sits down for an hour or so and then feels the need for more exercise? Well, I was not one to question it, so I gratefully handed her my water container, thanking her profusely. Love this hiker community!","Sassafrass Gap shelter

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527601,"Oh, it is a long way home today! I really have to push past my comfort zone, and while I did it yesterday, I am reluctant about the increase for today's challenging hike to Fontana Dam area. The good part about today is that I am meeting up with Crumpet, who is coming to take me off the trail for a respite. To make it even more fun, I have snagged SprinkleToes, Crisco and Bushwacker to join us. Just by looking at them,I figured they needed a shower the most! Not really, as we all stink and are really dirty. They are just fun to be around and are enjoyable company.We made plans on where to meet up at the end of the day and I practically bolted out of camp at the ungodly hour of 8:15 am, knowing I would need all day to make the mileage. The map showed a nice downhill day with a few bump ups to keep it interesting. It was perfect terrain for me and I was able to once again stretch out my stride and make good time. I covered the first 6 miles easily and made it to Cable Gap shelter in time for lunch with SprinkleToes,Crisco, Flo, and Sunshine, who all passed me within an hour of my start. They were all soaking their feet in the creek when I arrive, and I joined them in a hurry, as my feet were feeling the mileage. Soon SoLow, Bushwacker and Spider arrived and did likewise. The freezing water felt so good and so awful at the same time! I rested about 45 minutes, then hit the trail again. One small climb up to Black Gum gap, then coast downhill for 4 miles. Are you thinking ""easy peasy""? I was, but my oh my what a surprise. The terrain was easy on the feet. Not many rock jumbles to navigate, or nasty roots to trip on, but constant downhills stress the knees in the worst way. Soon, not only were my feet complaining again, but my knees had joined the chorus. I finally put on my IPod to drown out their complaints and that helped to pass the time. It was an afternoon of seeing through the trees down below to the Fontana Dam area and lake, yet not seeming to get any closer, all in all, a pleasant hike. As I descended, dropping to 1900', it was remarkable to see the changes in the trees budding, the bushes turning green and the floor of the forest filled with blooming trillium, may apples, bloodroot and other wildflowes which I can't identify. The green was so lush compared to the browns of the higher elevations. Just before I was about to drop from fatigue, I came to the road crossing and found my way to the information building to call for the shuttle. Lo and behold, there was Bushwacker, sitting and waiting for me so we could ride to the Lodge together. When the shuttle came, he slung my pack over his shoulder and I stumbled along behind, collapsing into the van. We headed up to the resort lodge, unloaded our packs and poles and entered civilization. It was wonderful to sink into the comfortable lounge seats in the common area of the lodge in front of a huge fireplace where we relaxed while waiting for Crumpet. It seemed she was going to be delayed by traffic and so when the restaurant opened at five we headed in. We got a large table and soon were joined by other hikers who are just as hungry. I think we amused the waitress as we ordered great quantities of food and beverages. There is absolutely nothing like coming off the trail from five days of dehydrated food into a restaurant and ordering a hot meal which is then placed in front of you with real silverware and cloth napkins. It was just heavenly. Crumpet arrived and we packed her car with our packs, poles and stinky boots. Soon we were in Gatlinburg, unloading and getting settled into the most wonderful condo.

Our three fellow hikers worked on their laundry, showers were taken and we found ourselves around the dining room table chatting until 11 pm! I dreamt that I smelled bacon cooking and coffee brewing. Could it possibly be? As I came awake, I remembered where I was and thought "" oh boy, no oatmeal today""! Crumpet was busy in the kitchen turning out a feast. The odors drifted thru the condo and soon the others began appearing, following their noses. We sat down and made Crumpet happy by devouring everything in sight, and then made some more. Over breakfast, plans were made to drive our friends back to Fontana Dam. SprinkleToes and Crisco were going to get back on the trail and continue north, in the rain, I might add. Bushwacker was going back to the Fontana Lodge to meet up with a friend and take a zero there. My job was to do the dishes and get started on my hiker girl chores: laundry, clean my water filter, scrub more dirt off my person and rest. I was successful at all of the above. Even after two showers of scrubbing, I still horrified myself when I took a jacuzzi tub bath and still left a ring around the tub, ugh! The rest of the day was uneventful. Crumpet returned and we went out to do errands and pick up some supplies. Had a great BBQ at Bennetts. I highly recommend it if you are ever in Gatlinburg. We then returned to the condo to sort food and get packs ready for our hike starting Thursday.

Her SUV was loaded with all sorts of goodies that hikers crave: drinks, snacks, fresh fruit,, veggies and various sundries, like toilet paper, hand sanitizers, wipes, extra water, etc. She also had planned to join me for a few days hiking. We put our heads together and hatched the following plan.Rather than return me to Fontana Dam and have to wait until the end of the week for me to reappear at Newfound Gap, I decided to skip this section (Fontana to Newfound Gap). This would serve two purposes. One, I would get to help her with the trail magic, and have the fun of seeing hikers I started with, coming by. Secondly it would give me a second day of rest which my body seems to be asking for, and thirdly, Crumpet and I could hike from Newfound Gap northward to my next resupply stop, where her husband would pick us up and shuttle us back to the condo for an overnight, thus giving us 5 days of hiking together instead of 3. When I return south after I complete the AT, Crumpet, and hopefully the rest of my 'send off ' hiking gang, will join me for the final hurrah of completing Fontana to Newfound gap. I think it is the perfect plan. I was never a purist about having to hike each and every mile of the AT. Rather, I am doing this for the overall experience. If that means altering my itinerary to enhance someone else's experience ( like providing trail magic food, or overnight opportunities) or enriching my own life with unscheduled symphony concerts and making new friends in Franklin, NC, then that is my priority.

Some were familiar faces from earlier days. A big crowd of youngins came in well after 11 pm and were having a noisy time catching up with each other. It turned out they had been drinking in Gatlinburg, testing tequila and moonshine and had decided to hike drunk in the dark. What were they thinking? The next morning as they were relating this story to us, I asked them did they learn anything? One replied yes I'll never hiked drunk again.

Crumpet and I took the side Trail to Charlie's bunion, a huge Rocky outcrop with spectacular views of the valley. A sign at the beginning of the trail said 'guard children closely'. Haha! I guess adults with vertigo would be smart enough to totally avoid that trail. Not so, and this adult pushed through the fear, trying to keep calm and carrying on. Note the 'calm' face in the picture above. After that, the trail bumped up and down to Pecks Corner shelter.

A huge tarp was strung across the entire front of the shelter to keep the wind out. Fortunately it was not a problem today as there was just a gentle breeze. While we were assessing where to hang a hammock and plant a tent a Ridge Runner came in and our hearts sunk. The rule is, in the Smokies, you must sleep in the shelter unless it is already full. Well we were number two and number three to arrive and with the Ridge Runner there to enforce the rules it was to be a shelter night for us. What exactly does that mean? Well, it is a two-tier shelter, sleeping 12. We staked out our space on the upper level hoping it would be warmer (body heat from below rises to keep us warm) and easier to get in and out. It is noisy: people snoring, mumbling in their sleep, thrashing around on noisy sleeping pads trying to get comfortable, etcetera. Not to mention worrying about the mice scurrying around you.

I'd like to say it helped, but I think it was my silliness making us laugh that improve the mood. Crumpet was not feeling well as she may have been suffering from some altitude sickness so we were quite the pair. We left camp late, about 10 ish and the trail had us climbing all morning until we reach 6300 feet,skirting Mt.Guyot.

Off we went, knowing that we had one more climb, then 6 miles of downhill to the next shelter. It was a long 5 hours, but I was so happy when we arrived. Familiar faces greeted us as we came dragging in. One friend pointed out hammock trees for me, another directed Crumpet to a space for her in the shelter.

Crumpet and I sat at the shelter enjoying our breakfast, the peace and quiet and watching the birds bathing in the creek. I got up after most of the hikers had cleared out. The majority usually hit the trail before 8 a.m. We took our time, savoring the morning, laughing about how we 'only' had 7.6 miles to hike today. That used to be the maximum miles I would hike in a day. Now I have broken another mental barrier where a 12-mile day is The New Normal. Spirits high, we set off around 10 a.m., to climb Mount Cammerer. That was the only climb for the day. Lots of day hiker were out and it is fun to stop and chat. Mount Cammerer is at 4950 feet elevation and has a fire tower on top. To go up to the fire tower would have added 1.2 miles to our day, so we both agreed we didn't need to go there. Instead we prefered to head down hill, looking for the next water source to refill our bottles and a place to have lunch. The spring was right on the trail. We threw down our packs, filtered water and decided to lunch right there. It was a cool shady glen area and very pretty. A few day hikers came through and were able to navigate around us and our packs strewn about on the trail. Checking our map we saw it was now down hill to the next shelter, our destination for the night. Off we set, down the trail on the sunny side of the Mountain. The day was getting warmer and warmer and soon it was over 75 degrees. I was feeling the sun beating on me and I had no hat, so I got my umbrella and used it as a parasol. It worked perfectly and thankfully the trail was wide enough to avoid smacking into bushes and trees with it. I practically ran into the shelter area, sporting my new hiker fashion accessory and got SprinkleToes and Crisco, who had passed a while back,laughing at my antics. Then they agreed it was a great idea. Davenport shelter was to be home for the night,another stone shelter with a fireplace except it was enclosed by a chain link fence. It is a relic from the past when shelters had fence enclosures to protect hikers from the bears. Except the hikers made it worse by throwing food out to the bears, knowing the bears could not get in at them. I believe all of the shelters in the Smokies were like this originally, and all but this one have had those horrible fence enclosures removed. It was dark and dank inside and very smelly. As we sat there resting, Crumpet saw a fat Mouse running along the wall. This did not please her at all. She looked at me and said ""it's only 3 more miles to a shower and a real bed, not to mention a hot dinner that we do not have to cook!"" I looked around, taking in the dank shelter, the mouse, the toilet ""area"" signs that mean there is no privy and checked the map. It was all downhill to the road. I nodded and we threw on our packs and practically ran down hill for 3 miles, chanting ""shower, dinner, bed""! We made record time down to the road, and sat and waited for Crumpet's husband to come pick us up. Just as he arrived, SprinkleToes, Crisco, SoLow and Crow came down the trail looking hot and tired. Crumpet's husband offered them Gatorade and snacks which they gratefully accepted. Then they moved down towards their next campsite for the night and we loaded up the truck with our packs and went up the road a bit to Standing Bear Farm to retrieve my resupply package. I had originally planned to spend the night there, but had my arm twisted into going to Pigeon Forge and staying in a wonderful condo with clean sheets and a hot shower. Who could resist? Since we completed the trail a day early it meant I would be able to take a zero tomorrow and rest my knees and my feet once again. Rest is a good thing......","Crosby Knob shelter

I was enjoying the greenery, the budding leaves on the trees, the Pines, the smell of Balsam in the hot sun when all of the sudden I came upon this little snowman on the side of the trail. I just had to stop and admire him and wondered where he came from and who built him. Then I noticed a few feet away there was a pile of snow under a log, lingering and sheltered from the sun. He was just so cute and welcoming I had to stop and take his picture. I hope you enjoy him as much as I did. Today was spent in the usual manner of a zero day. Good sleep, good food, good company. That's all a hiker needs. Did I mention clean clothes?","Standing Bear Farm

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528806,"Crumpet and her husband kindly drove me back to Standing Bear Farm Road and dropped me off at the trailhead. We all looked at it and it went up, up, and up. It was to be a three-mile climb to the top of Snowbird mountain before a long slow descent to Groundhog shelter. The day was beautiful, clear skies and warm. But once I started climbing I began to notice how really warm it was. The temperatures probably got up to the high 70s today and it was a hot and sweaty climb. I made a novice hiker mistake early on by not stopping at a beautiful water source. Instead I had opted to go 8/10 of a mile more to the next source which was somewhat questionable as per the map. When I arrived at the location it was dried up. I had about a cup of water to get me up and over Snowbird mountain and partially down the other side to the next strong water source. Lesson learned, never pass up a water source because you don't want to carry it up hill! I got to the top of Snowbird mountain and it was unusual because it is completely bald meaning there is grass growing and no trees. There is also an FAA Tower up there and the views were remarkable. I found a nice spot to sit and have lunch but did not linger because there was no shade and the sun was becoming too hot to be comfortable. It wasn't long on the way down before I found the next water source and quickly filled up a one liter container, filteted it and drank it immediately. Then I refilled it and another container and I was all set to go. The hike downhill was not too bad, some rocky footing but mostly a nice trail that made it easy to move along. I surprised myself by getting to the shelter area very early, 2:30 p.m. It felt odd to be in so early and I felt a little guilty about quitting so soon, but I was concerned about going another three miles and camping near a forest service road on my own. That's usually never a good idea. I stayed in the shelter area and soon people began to drift in. It has been a pleasant evening of getting to know new faces and catching up with old friends. It's going to be a warm night, dropping down into the low fifties and promises to be a three quarter full moon. Tonight will be the first time I'm sleeping without setting up my tarp and I am lying in my hammock looking through the mosquito netting up at the sky and hoping that it will be a bright and starry night. Tomorrow will bring a long day of 13 plus miles, but since Crumpet and I pushed the limits last week, I'm confident I can do it. Especially if I get out of bed early and get moving!!","Standing Bear Farm

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531249,"I was really looking forward to today, in spite of having to hike 13.1 miles, a very long day for me. Luckily, I am two days away from town, so my food supply is dwindling and weighs very little. I left early, about 8 am, knowing it was going to take me a long time. The trail started right uphill, and climbed and climbed. Six miles into it, I finally reached Max Patch Bald, only to have to climb up even higher! This mountain is all grass on top and no tree. I thought it would be a great place to have lunch and admire the views, but the wind was so bad, it was all I could do to race across. It's hard to move fast when the wind is blowing you sideways! I got down off the Bald and back into the forest. Not too far in was a nice flat area that was obviously used for camping, and had a fire ring, so I plopped myself down, took off my boots and socks so they could dry out. The weather has been beautiful and warm, now in the 80's. But it also makes for sweaty feet! Bushwacker soon came along and joined me. He had stayed on top for awhile and was able to get some good pictures. Over lunch we discussed the various flowers we have seen, especially Trilliums. Up to now we had only seen purple. Now white ones were appearing and I wasn't sure if they were still Trilliums. I took a picture of a white one and sent it off to my sister, the horticulturist, to identify. Soon I had an answer, yep, another variety of Trillium. We then continued onward down a beautifully maintained trail, along Roaring Fork Creek. There were a lot of day hikers climbing up to Max Patch, so there was plenty of stopping to chat. The last part of the afternoon was spent climbing upwards to Walnut Mountain Shelter, home for the night. The shelter was dismal and gloomy, and I was thankful to have my hammock. The water source was down a side trail, in a very boggy area. Because Bushwacker arrived earlier, he offered to climb down and collect for both of us. Ahh, the kindness of fellow hikers! The wind keeps picking up and getting stronger and colder. Dinner was a quick affair, and I retreated to my hammock. Tomorrow is to be another 13 mile day to get into Hot Springs. I am looking forward to being in a town, inside a building, out of the wind and getting a hot shower. My morale is suffering, and I am tired of being cold and windblown. The higher mileage isn't helping either; my resolve is weakening.","Groundhog shelter

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531253,"Last night was horrendous. The wind whipped and blew. My hammock rocked and the tarp blew against me all night long. It felt like some little child was jumping on the bed. I gave up trying to sleep in and got up at 6 am. Running about, throwing everything into my backpack, I tore out of the campsite and down the hill, desperate to find someplace out of the wind to sit and warm up. After two miles, I came to a rocky spot on the trail that was in the morning sun. I sat down, fired up the stove and made an enormous cup of tea to accompany my breakfast Cliff bar. It was so peaceful and quiet, like another world. I didn't want to leave, but knew there was a shower waiting at the end of the day. As I lingered, hikers from the shelter began trickling by, so I knew I needed to get going. The good thing about today is that it is a downhill run, but a long one. Lots of switchbacks to work your way down, but relatively easy on the feet, not so much the knees though. By afternoon, I was dragging, hot and miserable. Bugs were buzzing around and while swatting at them I managed to smack myself with my hiking pole. So sad, but so funny! As we got around the side of the mountain where Hot Springs was below, I caught up to Bushwacker. I was glad to see a friendly face, and just put my head down and followed him down the trail. Soon we began to smell smoke and noticed planes flying back and forth. It was obvious there was a big fire somewhere and we were hoping we weren't in danger. Soon there was a clearing we could see through and saw where the smoke was coming from, across the valley, on the next ridge over. Planes were busy going back and forth dropping water and fire retardant. It added a bit of excitement to the final descent.About 4:30 pm, we hit level ground, and there off to the left was Laughing Heart Hostel. I was so glad not to have to walk too far, and soon sank into a chair on the patio, catching my breath and trying to cool off. Whenever did winter end so suddenly and summer begin? The owner of the hostel was off investigating the fire and the impact on hikers, and the hostel, so I had to wait to check in. It was good to just sit, while listening to those around me talk about the fire. Apparently it was arson, and had now spread quite a ways, shutting down the trail north of Hot Springs as well as the hills above the town. At one point there was mention of evacuating the town. Rain was expected the next day, and given the way I was feeling, I decided that a zero day was in order. I really need to think about what I am going through, and why I am struggling mentally………….","Walnut Mountain Shelter

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531422,"I woke up this morning to the sound of rain on the window, and voices in the hostel kitchen discussing how we are all stuck here. The trail is closed due to the forest fire, for an indeterminant amount of time. Everyone is fretting about the miles they will be missing. Everyone but me, that is. I am lying in bed feeling miserable and wondering why. Other than the usual nagging issues of knees and feet, physically I feel fine. Although there is that deep fatigue that comes from walking many miles carrying 25-30 pounds,but it is more than that. I want to quit. I want to go home. I miss my friends; I miss my life. I miss hot running water. I hate having dirty hands all the time. Now I can't even hike the next 14 miles because the trail is closed, so I have to rework my food plan as well as recalculate daily mileage and where to camp at night. It is overwhelming. Quitting weighs heavily on my mind. Should I or shouldn't I? I've hiked an awful long ways and lived to tell about it. So I have accomplished something. But it is not enough. Sighing heavily, I get out of bed and go make a cup of tea, hoping to bring clarity to this miasma.Having downed the first cup, I decide the first step is to fix the knee and leg cramp issue. I call and make an appointment for a massage. That done, I work on the second cup of tea. The mind fog is clearing, and I realize that I cannot quit today. It is a well know fact that you never, ever quit on a bad day. If you truly want to quit, it must be done on a day with beautiful blue sky, white puffy clouds, sun shining, temperature perfect for hiking, beautiful views and a wonderful place to camp. That is when you can toss down your pack and say goodbye to the trail.During my massage, there at the hostel/lodge, I am told that Hot Springs is a place many people quit or think of quitting. We have all come 273 miles and everyone is worn thin. As the massage therapist stated, many have breakdowns about now, and many leave the trail. She assures me that what I am going through is normal and to be expected. I feel a great sense of relief. I am not alone in my struggle. This later proves to be true as I sit with other hikers around the dinner table, and we honestly evaluate how we are viewing this adventure. What an eyeopener: they all feel the same. It is hard, hard work, day after day. Everyone is working hard to remain positive, but again, even that is hard work!!Tonight I met my new hiking partner, Kangapard. She wears a kangaroo hat and when it was cold, she had leopard print pants. Thus the trail name Kangapard!She had been hiking with her cousin, and it just wasn't working out. I invited her to look over my mileage plan and see if she wanted to hike with me for the week, covering from Hot Springs, NC to Erwin, TN. It is always reassuring to have a hiking buddy, especially camping. I told her of my struggles, and that I had decided not to quit today, but to give it another week until I reached Erwin. I reread all the wonderful supportive journal entries readers have sent in and take strength from them. Thanks to social media, more support comes pouring in through Facebook. I sent a message to fellow Trail Dames telling of my woes, and they begin a network of communication to see who is in the area that may be able to help, in any way. Offers come pouring in. Everyone wants me to succeed, even people who don't know me. I am uplifted. I will try again. I will continue on……..","Groundhog shelter

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531945,"Laughing Heart Hostel was a great place to stay in Hot Springs. The owner was busy arranging free shuttles to Allen Gap, 14 miles from where we all left off. The fire seems to be contained, but rumors fly that it has started up in spite of the rain. While at the hostel I met the father of one of the hikers who was there to visit his son. He kindly offered to shuttle myself, Kangapard and her cousin up to Allen Gap, so we loaded into his van and off we set. It was a dreary, rainy morning and as we went up the mountain, the fog began to set in. Paul dropped us off and pointed us in the right direction, and the climbing began. Kangapard's cousin soon blasted by both of us, and without a word, disappeared into the fog. We would not see him again until weeks later. I guess he decided to ""hike his own hike"". That was well and good with Kangapard, but he could have told her he was moving on.Our packs were heavier than usual as we had six days of hiking to tackle before resupplying in Erwin TN.We took our time ascending and it was fun because all of the hikers stuck in town for a few days were all starting again. One by one, they came by and we had many opportunities to stop and rest while chatting. During one such rest stop, I noticed something odd looking off to the side of the trail. On closer inspection, it turned out to be a very long intact snakeskin. Sure glad I wasn't around when the snake was removing it!!Today was a short day, due to the climbing all day, and we pulled into camp about 3:30. It was a nice area in a gap that had a creek running nearby, complete with a pipe to make gathering water easier. We got set up and sat and watch the latecomers hike by. Soon we were joined by a young woman, who sat down, said she was starving, and began to unload every single food item she was carrying. It turned out that she had at least 16 pounds of food with her. It was quite comical watching her! She explained that her father just sent her a care package, full of boxes of spaghetti, 16 granola bars, 12 Lipton pasta sides, etc. Who carries that much?? She allowed that she felt obligated to carry it since it was so nice of her father to send it. She then entertained us with stories of her travels, living in Nepal, starting grad school soon in Belgium, traveling to Sri Lanka after her hike, etc. Then to our amazement, she filled up a large stuff sack with water and soap and began to wash her clothes, hanging them to dry on a line strung between two trees. While she was busy doing all this she was tromping around barefooted! She obviously was used to being in a third world country without modern conveniences!It was a wonderful evening around the fire ring listening to her stories.

This is a very rocky area, Whiterock Cliff and Blackstack Cliffs. The AWOL guide warns that the area around the Firescald is ""rocky and strenuous"" so I convince Kangapard that we might enjoy the bypass trail more! It was a great decision, because the footing was good and the views even better and we made good time. Our only big climb today was up Big Butt Mountain. We had a good laugh over that name. I don't know where they think up these names, but some of the more entertaining ones have been: Chunky Gal trail, Sweat Heiffer Mountain, Big Butt Mountain, and lots of Lick Log Gaps!The mileage went well today and we got into camp in time to make a cup of tea before setting up.

The trail today went through the woods, down into a valley. As we were going down towards a road, I heard bells! I couldn't tell if they wind chimes at someone's house or someone was hiking with bells on their packs to alert bears that they were coming. When I hit the road, I saw cows in the meadow and a stile we had to climb over. Such a wonderful change from hiking in the mountains! As we climbed the stile, the cows moved away under the tree into the shade (making them hard to see in the picture above) and we continued through their field and up the hill on the other side. Apparently the cows like hiking the AT because the path was full of hoof prints! As we walked through these woods and dry leaves, I noticed a popping sound, like someone was popping corn. I stopped to listen and looked closer and saw that the noise was caused by lots of little grasshoppers hopping around on the dead leaves. I've never seen such a number of grasshoppers in one place before. Up a little further, the leaves were rustling and moving about. I stayed quiet for a moment and then saw that the noise was coming from a dozen or so little field mice chasing each other around. It always amazes me what you can see when you hold still for a moment and just observe.One point of interest today was a beautiful cascade we passed. Later when talking about it at the shelter, I learned that one of the young men earned his trail name ""Waterfall"" there. Yes, he did climb to the top and yes, he did find it slippery and fell down the waterfall. Fortunately he only injured his prideOne last huge climb took me up Sugarloaf Gap and Licklog Rock. At least I thought it was the last climb. I couldn't have been more wrong, as with the way of the trail, you usually have to climb uphill to a shelter, and so it was. It was just 0.8 mi up, but seemed like it took forever. The same crowd from last night's shelter was here and we sat comparing notes on the day's hike over dinner. As the evening wore on, the young noisy, dope smoking crowd from last night rolled in, sleepings bags were thrown down, joints lit up and their partying resumed. Sigh.

This is getting so old. I ate quickly, packed up and we hit the trail, hoping to get an early start on the crowd. In retrospect it didn't matter because they sat around the table until noon, entertaining themselves passing around a pipe. We keep hoping they will pass us and do more miles but it isn't happening. Guess they are getting really ""relaxed""! Heading out of the shelter area it is a downward hike to Sams Gap and US23, where there are garbage cans! Yay, I can get rid of my garbage bag, a quart size ziplock stuffed to the gills. On the way down I cane to a marble marker. It is a dedication memorial of a local family who owned the property and sold it to the government. It listed the family members names and each had a biblical quote. Hmm. Kind of an odd place, I think, for such a memorial. A short time later I met a hiker coming up the trail and we stopped to chat. His name is Morgan and he works for the ATC. He was on his way up to inspect the memorial as the ATC has received a number of complaints regarding the religious nature of said monument. People finding the religious nature of it offensive. His objective was to figure out how to re-route the trail around the back of it so that only those who wanted to read it could. Unbelievable. Later when we saw him again, he thought he had solved the problem. The ATC would rotate the monument 180 degrees so that if you wanted to see it, you left the trail to walk around to read it. It would be fun to come back in the fall and see if this project has been accomplished.Today walking across Big Stamp, a treeless saddle on a ridge, I found trail magic set up under a tree. It was a hot, hot day and I was so happy to find bottles of water on a bed of ice at the base of a tree. I grabbed one and downed it immediately. There was more bald to cross and an orchard of thorn apples to hike through. The trees were in bloom and there was a carpet of white flowers throughout. So pretty. I checked the map and lo and behold, it was downhill to the shelter! What a relief to cruise downhill to camp for the night. Usual chores were done, dinner made and plans made for tomorrow. Ohhh nooo, here comes the party crowd and they are setting up for the night. This is very disheartening to hike all day long and be challenged by this every night this week.

There is a short climb up to Little Bald, elevation 5220 feet, today and it was a rocky, boulder climb. Hard, but fun. Then downhill for a bit to recover before hitting another short uphill. Soon we were following a creek downhill, crossing streams on footbridges, or sometimes rock hopping. When we got to Olgesby Branch, there was a great spot in a glade to take a break for lunch. By now it was at least 85 degrees and I just wanted to jump into the water. So I did! Well, maybe not jumped, but did step carefully into a knee deep spot to soak my feet and try and dunk my head into it to cool off. The ice cold water felt so good.I procrastinated here quite a while and many hikers going by looked envious. Some even joined me.But there was more trail to hike and I had to pull myself away and head uphill. We followed the branch (creek) upstream and crisscrossed it many times. I just love being by water and hiking by it. Its a real mood changer!Kangapard and I arrived at the shelter around 5 pm to find a few hikers already here. No one was set up in the shelter yet; it was suspiciously empty! Ramblejunk was cooking his elaborate dinner at the table outside the shelter and casually announced that there was a big black snake in the shelter! He pointed it out, curled up in a corner under the floorboards. It was behind wire mesh fencing, so I wasn't too concerned and continued on with my dinner preparations. As hikers came in, the announcement was made and everyone continued to scatter around the shelter setting up tents and hammocks. Up come two young men, one of them Waterfall, and they threw their packs into the shelter. They were happy to find space, as rain was expected tonight. Ramblejunk informed them of the visitor and they sat there mulling over this news. We all went back to our dinner preparations. Suddenly there was a bit of a scuffle behind me (my back was to the shelter) and Rumblejunk's (sitting across from me, facing the shelter) eyes got really big, so I turned around in time to see the young man coming out of the shelter with this enormous thick healthy black snake wrapped around the shovel. We all jumped back, while he calmly and casually walked away from the shelter, down over the ridge and threw the snake even further!He walked back, pointed to a spot in the shelter and announced ""that is MY space for the night""!!We gave him a round of applause and I asked Waterfall if his friend was a southern country boy. He said ""nah, he's from Texas. That ain't nothin' for him."" I gave the young man the trail name of Snake Charmer!Thunder sounded off in the distance and rain began to fall.

Kangapard and I had decided on a late start, as we had only 6.2 miles to hike into Erwin. The wetness didn't deter the younger hikers and they were up and out of camp by 8 am. Things quieted down and the birds began to sing. Soon the sun came out and began to dry things out. I set my tarp up ""porch"" style and sat on a ground cloth and cooked breakfast right there. Now this is the kind of morning I like! But a hot shower was waiting at the hostel in Erwin, so we packed up and off we went.The trail was another downhill roll into Erwin. It was one of those days where you can see the town and river from the top and keep seeing it all the way down. It always seems so close, but it is still 6 plus miles away. I was leading, and it again was hot and humid from the rain. I had taken my glasses off because they kept fogging up. Humming along, I was making good time, when suddenly something stick like moved on the trail. I screeched to a halt, popped my glasses on and took a closer look. Oh! It was a brown snake, about 3 feet long. Ok, no big deal. I stopped, it stopped and Kangapard came up and said ""what's wrong?"" I replied there is a snake in the way and it won't move. (The last one we saw was black and it moved off immediately as Kangapard approached. No problem, says she, let's just throw a rock at it to scare it off. So she did, and it didn't move, it just looked mad. I clacked my poles together to scare it, but that didn't work either. Well, this snake was beginning to look really irritated, so we backed up a bit and assessed how we could go around it. There just wasn't much room. Kangapard tells me to go first and she will watch and holler if it moves. Ha! So, sucker that I am, I carefully maneuvered through a rhododendron bush and got safely around. Then she came the same way. Moving on, we both heaved a sigh of relief and wondered what the heck kind of snake that was. Continuing on downward I came around a switchback and there on the trail was a broken egg. I stopped, wondering who in the heck carries an egg on the trail? I heard a rustle up ahead and looked up, to see a big turkey trotting down the trail! It was a hen, and I must have scared it coming around the corner, it laid an egg, which broke, and then ran down the trail! As I moved slowly forward the turkey did as well. She would stop and look back at me, and then run down a few more feet, stop and look back. This continued on for about 100 feet before she took to flight. I'll take a turkey over a snake any day!We got down to Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel and what a zoo. The place was packed and I was stricken to find out that there was to be a big Shindig Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Nooooo, please, not more of this insanity. We had reserved two nights and had hopes of getting some rest and getting reorganized. Needing lunch, we got a ride into town to the Pizza joint. There we ran into Snake Charmer and Waterfall. I described the brown snake to Snake Charmer and Kangapard showed him the picture she took. His comment was that it was one pissed off copperhead! YIKES!!!! Well, no harm done, and now we know what a copperhead looks like up close and personal!Lots of our hiking friends are here at Uncle Johnny's and we all went out to dinner together. It was fun to meet and catch up again. As we returned to the hostel, we learned it was packed full and there were 30 tents and hammocks set up in the communal yard. Showers taken, and gear was hung out to dry as we headed to bed for a good night's sleep. It was not to be. Someone cranked some music, others brought in beer and the picnic tables outside filled with hikers ready to party well into the night.

Kangapard and I were rescued from Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel on Friday, April 29th. We had awakened that morning to some guy vomiting and retching outside our cabin window. That was all it took for me, and I called a local motel to see if they had space. We were to stay at the hostel one more night, but neither one of us wanted to take a chance of a repeat of last night's fiasco, plus the shindig that was scheduled to begin late Friday. Crumpet was coming today to visit and she would move us over to the motel. On her way, she let me know that friends of hers were going to join us for breakfast, and she was hopeful they would be able to provide us with some type of trail magic. Just as I put my phone down, a couple appeared in our doorway and said ""Hi, we're Sarah and Shane, and you are coming with us. Grab all your gear and get in the truck""!! I was so overtired and so grateful for this rescue, that I burst into tears! (very embarrassing, by the way). Doing as we were instructed, before they could get away, we quickly packed up and threw our stuff in their pickup truck just as Crumpet arrived. Off we all went to a local restaurant, Clarence's, that is well known for their biscuits and gravy. Hiker hunger has truly taken over and I had an immense breakfast. I don't know about the gravy, but I can say those biscuits are the best I have had here in the south!
A plan was hatched over breakfast. They were going to take us home with them, and we would stay with them for the next 10 days. Each day they would drop us off at a trailhead, we would hike and then they would pick us back up where we finished. We spent the afternoon on their lovely back porch pouring over the AWOL guide and working up reasonable daily mileages, while enjoying the pond and waterfall and the many birds visiting the feeders. This plan allowed us to hike longer miles carrying just a small daypack, a huge relief after lugging around 30 pounds. 
Saturday dawned with the drill sergeant hollering ""load 'em up"" and off we went for day 1, miles hiked: 13.0. It was a rainy day, but pleasant hiking without worrying about gear getting wet and setting up in the rain. What a luxury to return to a warm, dry house each night, jump into a hot tub and do more bird watching! I could get used to this. Sunday was a shorter day, 8.5 miles, again rainy. I am getting to enjoy hiking in the rain. Monday was tough. It was a 16.1 miler, my longest yet. The trail here in TN are really nice. Good footing, well maintained and not overly strenuous. It is a wonderful change and I am beginning to revive and gain hope. Maybe I can do this after all! I was extremely sore and tired when we finished and wanted nothing more than a day off, but nope, not allowed!! Tuesday was a short one, for recovery from the previous day, and we did 6.5 and were done before noon! Wednesday 11.8 miles went by fast as well. Where is all this speed coming from? It doesn't hurt anymore. My legs seem to know what to do without a lot of effort from me, so I am just along for the ride and begin to daydream as I hike. Thursday rolled around, and oh no, not another 16 miler. Sigh. Out we go, and are done in 9 hours. Friday's hike was 14.8, Saturday 10.4 and Sunday was Mother's Day, and I got to take a day off! It was wonderful to sleep in a little and just sit on the porch birdwatching with my feet up, and a cat in my lap. We are enjoying ourselves way too much, and I am sure our host is growing concerned that we are putting down roots! Monday rolls around and it's back to work, our final day of slack packing, and we complete 14.7 miles in record setting time. Total mileage slack packed these 9 days of hiking= 111.6 miles. Wow! When we return to the trail, we will be just 15 miles south of Damascus, VA.
There were many highlights to these 9 days. The hiking was actually enjoyable. I think I like TN the best so far and would recommend it to anyone, especially those starting out as newbies. The views were always incredible. We went over many balds that took some serious effort to climb, but were well worth the views. The day we did Roan High Knob, it was 30 degrees and the wind was howling. Snow covered the top, and the pine branches were loaded with icy snow. It looked like a winter wonderland, and being that wonders never cease, we didn't have to sleep out there in the cold like the rest of the hikers!! Climbing Jane Bald, we could see all the way to Watauga Lake and dam area, of which we had hiked the perimeter one day. 
There are many waterfalls in this stretch and thankfully we hiked those stretches in good weather, seeing Laurel Fork falls and Jones falls. I had lunch at the iconic Overmountain Shelter, an old restored barn, watching other hikers, looking like little ants (so high and far away) climb Little Hump and Big Hump (more balds) before I took my turn. That was hard work and the wind was so strong up there that it almost blew me over sideways.
Another delightful aspect of slack packing was that each day we went in a different direction, totally confusing my family and friends following my tracking device. Some days we headed north, other days we went south. Our direction for the day was decided by the elevation changes, as we both prefer to get the hard climbing over with in the mornings. It was so nice to have a choice! This reversal of direction also meant that we were running into different groups of hikers each day that we know. It was fun to chat and catch up and on one morning I carried extra tangerines to hand out to friends I knew I would be passing by that day, a little trail magic, compliments of our host Sarah!
Our slack packing has come to an end,and tomorrow we take a zero to do laundry and work on reorganizing our packs. Words cannot express how grateful and thankful I am to Sarah and Shane for this wonderful opportunity to rest while still gaining mileage. Hiking longer mileage than I was used to conditioned my legs and lungs without the added weight of a pack. I feel fitter than ever. It was also a much needed mental break, and I have reset my attitude. I now know that I can do this, and I will finish this hike.","Erwin, TN

We are busy making plans to have Sarah and Crumpet join us for some hiking in part of Virginia.The usual errands got done, food organized, although it will only take us two days to get into Damascus, so not much was needed.I thought I would post this picture of a rainbow taken yesterday when a storm rolled into the valley in front of the house. It actually turned into a double rainbow, but I don't think you can see it in the picture.I want to apologize to my readers about the last few entries being condensed, instead of daily entries. I know they lack interesting detail, but I felt it was more important to get caught up than get further behind. I now have a friend back home helping me with entries, so the postings will be more regular. Thanks, Liz!Connie, to answer your question about shelters vs. stealth camping. Yes we could have maybe avoided some of this party crowd by stealth camping, but probably not. Once a tent is set up (stealth), others tend to join anyway, so you are rarely alone overnight. The reason we went shelter to shelter in the Hot Springs to Erwin area is that they are reasonably spaced mileage wise, and it is just so incredibly convenient to have a privy, rather than having to quickly dig a cat hole first thing in the morning. So water source and privy become priorities!!   As I travel northward, more and more shelters will not have privies, so I expect to be doing more stealth camping, the way I did in Georgia.I also had a nameless reader correct me on my photo, label, mileage etc at one point. I did delete the post because it was irritating. Please know that I am posting photos to make things interesting. I might not get the exact location correct, or what the mountain off in the distance is, because it really doesn't matter to me. This journal is about what I am thinking, feeling and seeing. I will try to be as accurate as possible, but when I take one picture and then don't use it for a week, I forget where it was taken! If you want exact details, you will have to come hike the AT yourself!Back to the trail tomorrow, and I am looking forward to it now. Look out Damascus, here I come!(Oh, did I mention that ""Trail Days"" a big party shindig is happening when we get there? Oh well, we will blast in on Thursday and leave on Friday, avoiding the partying masses) Also next up is Grayson Highlands and the wild ponies! Can't wait","Elizabethton, TN

Conferring with our trail angel, Sarah, it was decided that we should postpone our departure. Better to be safe than get hit by lightning up on the ridge. We would reassess at noon and make a plan. Sarah went off to work and Kangapard and I went I to full relaxation mode. (Zzzzzzz)I enjoyed being on the back porch watching the rain and the storm moving through and thinking how fortunate I was to be here and not out in it. I read through a few Backpacker magazines and then started to get antsy. Needing to move, I started to putter around the house doing cleaning chores. Kangapard was tracking the weather on TV and we reworked our plan for today. We will skip the 14 mile section from Low Gap into Damascus. In the fall, we will return to complete it with Sarah and her husband, as a day hike. Then we can celebrate our completion with them as they have been instrumental in our success!Sarah drove us to Damascus and on this route we went through this stone wall called Backbone Rock. It was a beautiful section of road. We had reservations at the Montgomery House B and B, so we dropped our bags there and headed off to find some dinner.Staying at this B and B are hikers that we have met and that Sarah provided Trail magic slackpacking for, Moonshine, Sunshine and Barnum. Very nice young people and lots of fun to be around.Time to head to bed, although it is fun to sit on the front porch here and watch all the hikers streaming into town for 3 days of festivities called Trail Days.We head out tomorrow and head north with loaded packs.

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533135,"It's time to get back on the trail. My pack is loaded with 7 days of food and my oh my, it sure is heavy! A thunder storm rolled through around 6 am, and it was nice to lie in bed and listen to it pass. I rolled out of bed about 7, and went down to the kitchen to make my tea and oatmeal. Taking it out to the front porch of the B and B, I found Barnum already there enjoying his morning coffee. While chatting, I found out he got his trail name because he used to work in a circus in the Tampa, Fl area! He is a very interesting young man, and I was surprised to find out that he is only 23. He has definitely got a good head on his shoulders. Finishing off his coffee he left to go find some breakfast, and I sat in the peace and quiet watching the town come awake. 
Damascus is a very small town and the Trail Days Festival brings in over 1000 hikers, or so I am told. It starts tomorrow yet the town is brimming with hikers and vendors already. There are freebies everywhere, free haircuts, free laundry, free dinner Friday, free knitted 'toboggan' hats, and even free showers, which a hiker desperately needs!
Calling an end to the people watching, I finished packing up and Kangapard and I went in search of a belt for me. I have dropped about 10 pounds, and I am in danger of losing my pants! 
Back at the B and B, we bid the owner goodbye and headed out the door to follow the trail down the street. The blazes were on the telephone poles! The Va. Creeper Trail is in this area, and we got to walk on a flat surface for .4 mi.!
I was thankful for this part of the trail because I was wobbling all over the place trying to balance. All those wonderful days of slackpacking, dancing lightly down the trail? OVER!! Gone was my balance; gone was the strength in my legs; all so disappointing! It reminded me of the first day of slackpacking when I kept tripping and stumbling trying to adapt to the lightness of the daypack!
It was a long climb today in the heat and humidity. I was moving at snail's pace, and had to sit and rest often. I think carrying 7 days of food is a big mistake, and I need to look ahead and be sure this doesn't happen again. Five days is probably a good compromise.
No views today, the trees are fully in leaf. There were lots of springs we crossed, and it is always refreshing to take a break and just listen to the water. We met lots of day hikers going southbound as well as some through hikers who had shuttled to the Grayson Highlands area and were hiking south back to Damascus for the festivities.
I got to the shelter about 5 pm and set up immediately as the skies were rumbling. Just as I finished, the rain began, and I sank gratefully into my hammock to wait it out. Dinner would just have to wait.
That shower passed, I ran down the trail to fetch water, got dinner started and more rain came. I was cooking at the picnic table by the shelter, so I stayed dry while watching hikers come pouring in. I didn't think it would be so crowded here, but with everyone headed south to Damascus, there are at least 30 people here tonight.
The rain has stopped, just drops on the tarp. It will be wonderful music to fall asleep to, smiling that I survived the first day of a full pack!!","Damascus, Va

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534931,"Another rainy morning which means packing up a wet tarp. Ugh, more weight! I finally got packed up and we left camp about 8:45 am. The weather has started to clear and the temperature is about 60, so nice hiking weather. My pack felt more comfortable today with less wobbling. We got to a pond that hikers in the shelter told us about and took a break while watching for turtles that they had reported. I saw nothing! Not even a frog, but it was a pretty spot. Everything is damp and musty smelling from the rain, but the streams are running making it easy to hike from one water spot to the next without having to carry many liters. Today's hike had us back on part of the Virginia Creeper Trail and it is sure fun to walk and have people riding by on bikes. How I envy them!! I would like to return some day with my bicycle and do the same. The trail crossed the longest wooden footbridge I have ever seen: the Luther Hassenger Memorial Bridge. It was up high on trestles. Leaving the Creeper trail, I climbed up to Lost Mountain Shelter and had a late lunch. I met two women there, hiking SOBO, who are members of NC Trail Dames: Data (Cindy) and Pollyanna. I belong to the Georgia chapter, so we had much in common. This shelter is relatively new and is in a beautiful wooded area. The water source was nearby and I took advantage of filling my bottles. I think I am still trying to rehydrate after yesterday! Setting off again we were going to hike another 2 hours and look for a stealth spot for the night. I had requested an earlier end to today as I am not up to speed with my pack being so heavy. Plus, my tarp was wet and everything was soggy from the rain. I wanted a chance to dry everything out before bedtime. We found a great spot just off the trail and set up for the night. It is a large campsite and so far we are the only ones here. It has been so calm and peaceful watching the sun set behind the mountain and listening to the birds. The evening is cool, perfect for sleeping and I am toasty warm in my sleeping bag. Tomorrow we climb up to 5000 feet and by Sunday I should be taking pictures of the wild ponies on Grayson Highlands. I can't wait!","Saunders Shelter

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534934,"I awoke to the sound of an owl hooting. While I was lying there it flew to a tree above our campsite and hooted some more. Now that's the kind of alarm clock I like! It looks to be a promising day; blue skies and sunny, but cool. We got out of camp about 8:45 am and began our day with an uphill climb to Buzzard Rock, at 5080 feet elevation. This area is a grassy bald with lots of rocks. There were great views in all directions. Proceeding downhill, we entered the Lewis Fork Wilderness and started climbing again. The weather had gotten gray and cold. As we ascended we could see clouds rolling into the valley below and the wind began to blow. I kept praying the rain would hold off until we got to camp. The climbing was very rocky and required constant attention to foot placement. At one point, I slipped, my pole slipped and I lurched forward, sure to do a face plant on the rocks. Somehow I managed to pull off a two footed landing, upright and intact, between two boulders. Ta Da!! Whew, that was a close one.As we got closer to the top, I began to see evidence of the wild ponies, piles and piles of manure on the trail. I guess they like to hike too! Suddenly, the forest ended and I came out onto the bald and there in the bushes and low trees were the ponies. Now I could see off into the distance and the clouds were darkening quickly. The trail curved to the right and as I came around the bend, here is a pony facing me, blocking the trail! She was so pretty, a palomino color. She munched some grass, then moved on and I continued on. Coming around another bend, I found 2 mares with their foals, a yearling and five or six more ponies. The foals were skittish and stuck close to Mama, but the yearling was more curious and came right up to me. I held out my hand, he sniffed it and walked away. I think he was disappointed but you are not supposed to feed them or disturb them in any way. They are part of a land management program and are there to eat the briars, grass and help maintain the balds.The ponies got bored with us and moved off and we headed for the shelter area as it began to hail! Yikes. I quickly found a place to set up, got chores done and crawled under my tarp to get out of the wind. Thankfully the hail didn't last long, but the temp kept dropping. It was going to be a long, cold night and I searched in my emergency kit for a hand warmer to help boost the warmth level in my sleeping bag. As I tucked in around 9 pm, the wind was gusting strongly. I tried to sleep, but kept imagining I would awake encased in ice!","stealth site

I couldn't even feel my fingers and toes. I gotta get out of this wind. I threw everything into my backpack, helter shelter, kept my sleep clothes on and layered on more. I told Kangapard I needed to bolt and so I did. Off I went in a big hurry. But of course, it is a very rocky area and required some major climbing. I raced across the Highlands, which is a beautiful area, but it was too cold to even look up and look around. I just wanted to get to a lower elevation. I will have to return in the summer weather to enjoy this area.Having gone 5.2 miles on empty belly, I got to Wise Shelter and tried to recoup by cooking breakfast, redressing into hiking clothes, having a cup of tea and warming up. At the lower elevation the wind wasn't so bad but the temps are only in the high 40's. The rest of the day challenged me with rocks and roots, not much to look at. As I approached the Stocks area I was amazed to see about 80 people wearing white hard hats! They were out here doing trail maintenance! As I came down the trail, they would yell out ""hiker approaching"" and work would stop and everyone would move to let you by. It made me feel like ""Princess CuppaTea""!!I had lunch behind the concrete block building, which was a privy. I know, the ambiance was lacking, but the privy blocked that infernal wind. Then it was time to move on. Up and over another bald area and down into the trees. At Oak Orchard Shelter, I took another rest break and chatted with White Noise, and Ukelady. There were also 6 young men already there in their sleeping bags, at 4 pm, trying to warm up from last night. We were all up at Thomas Know and collectively decided it was a horrendous night and that warmer temperatures are needed!I got to Fox Creek, a great stealth area, with water nearby.

It's a cloudy day and our hike began with a climb up to Chestnut Flats, at over 4000 feet. Virginia is very rocky and the footing is tough going. There was not much to see in the way of views but I passed many streams, crossed footbridges and enjoyed the few cascades that the trail passed. The trail descended as I approached Trimpi Shelter for an afternoon rest stop. This is an old stone shelter, with a fireplace. It is small, sleeping only 6. Hikers were setting up tents nearby as it was late afternoon. I so wanted to do the same, but we had decided to push on 3 more miles to a campsite next to a creek. It was an uphill and rocky trail. My feet were getting so sore by the time we found the site, I could hardly walk. I had wanted to stop at a previous site, next to water, but Kangapard thought the one listed in the book would be better and put us further up the trail. When we found the site, there were two hikers already there who had a campfire blazing. That was the good news. The bad news was that there was no water and we would have to walk back to the site I saw to get water. Sigh. So back I went, got water and returned to camp.

I nodded off for another hour. Boy, I was tired from yesterday's efforts. I could just stay in my hammock all day, but it was not to be. The rain showed no sign of giving up, so I got up, had breakfast and packed up, tarp wet again.Off we set, hiking in a gentle but steady rain. It really was pretty hiking, somewhat foggy, but very green. Again the trail was rocky; small rocks, the kind that causes you to roll an ankle if you are not careful. It's an uphill climb this morning and I was really struggling, just had no energy at all. This just doesn't feel right: I seem to be getting weaker and slower this week. As I plugged along, Kangapard would wait until I caught up and we would sit and rest while snacking. By noon we arrived at Partnership Shelter near the Mt. Rogers Visitor Center. The shelter is beautiful, like a log cabin, complete with running water, showers and flush toilets. Nearby is a phone to order pizza delivery!I threw down my pack, plopped down next to it, looked at Kangapard and said ""I gotta bail out"". It was day 6 on this section and I was just depleted. We were to be going into town tomorrow anyway, but I knew I couldn't finish our mileage for today, nor tomorrow's 12 miles.We hiked over to the Mt. Rogers Visitor Center to wait for the shuttle bus into Marion, VA. Inside was a bear!! This is the only bear I hope to see on the trail, so I had my picture taken with him to commemorate the event. They also had a scale for hikers to weigh themselves, so I did. Oh boy, I have lost 13 pounds. I knew I was down 3-4 pounds since weighing myself in Erwin, TN, but this last 10 came off in the last 2 weeks. This is not good. No wonder I don't have any energy.The bus came and we rocketed down the mountain. I think it amused the driver to see tired hikers being thrown side to side. This was probably payback for smelling so badly and tracking mud onto his bus.We checked into the Travel Inn and walked to the nearby Mexican restaurant to calorie load! I spent the remainder of the afternoon contacting a local trail angel, Rambunny. She has hiked the AT 3 times! I set us up for a slackpack for tomorrow so we don't lose any time off the trail. We'll slack from Mt. Rogers VC to Atkins where we have scheduled a much needed zero day and resupply.

She is so caring.Off we went right uphill. It sure was nice not having a huge pack on. My legs felt better and as the day went on I felt pretty good hiking. At the top of the hill we came upon a hiker resting. Hey, it's Pops! It is great to see him again. Last time we were together was back in Erwin, Tn. His hiking buddy, Jules, has had to get off the trail due to injury. She will not be returning. Pops was glad to have some company and we hiked together the whole day.By the time we got to the Chatfield Shelter for a late lunch, my feet were aching. Where did Virginia get all these rocks? Maybe it is time for new boots. At the shelter, I encountered Peanut and her dog Radley having lunch. I was so happy to see her, it's been more than a month since we last talked. I was glad to see that they are well. After lunch we cruised along as the trail suddenly improved. We came upon Lindamood School, an old one room schoolhouse. Hikers love stopping here because there is usually trail magic inside. We were not disappointed and I made a beeline for the mandarin orange fruit cup. The rest of the hike went by quickly as we crossed cow pastures, streams and railroad tracks.Just as we crossed the tracks, I heard the train whistle blow! A train is on its way. We went down into a marshy area with a boardwalk, paralleling the tracks. I wanted to watch the train go by so we stopped on the boardwalk. All the sudden I heard this animal 'chuffing' sound. Pops turned around and looked at me and I said ""Could that be a bear?"" The noise came again, off to our right. Pops started talking to it loudly and I clacked my poles as we hightailed it out of there. We didn't see the bear, and it is hard to fathom why a bear would be sitting in a marshy area, but we weren't going to take any chances. Shortly after, we arrived at the road, and Rambunny was there waiting for us. Telling her about the chuffing noise, she reported that there had been an old bear hanging around in that area!!!I can't wait to check into the Comfort Inn and spend 2 nights while taking a zero.

I had to stop at the pond 1.5 mi south of the shelter to fill up on water for the night and morning's cooking. As I looked ahead, it looked like there was a long, slow climb up more of the bald and then into the woods where I hoped the shelter stood. How wrong I was. Across the bald I went, into the woods. It started to rain, but I'm close, right? So no raincoat. I kept going. Now I am following an old road, and water is running down it and mud is everywhere. Keep on hiking. Up, up, up. The rain is coming down, down, down. Oh, I see the shelter. Thunder, boom! I pick up my pace, racing for the shelter. I flew in the door and the wind slammed it behind me.

It sleeps 8 and while there were already hikers here, there was still room. I quickly threw down my sleeping pad to claim a space and began to get out of wet clothes into dry ones. Even though my pad is really thin and might not be too comfortable, it was better than being outside in this raging rainstorm. The shelter filled up by 6 pm and we all hung wet things to dry while our dinners cooked. I can honestly say it did not smell very good in there, but hey, we're hikers and used to the stench!While sleeping on such a hard surface was not the best, I was so thankful to be shut inside, listening to the wind howling around the small concrete block building and the rain hitting the metal roof.

There is a great group here tonight, 15 in all. We are a combination of thru hikers and two section hikers. Two of the men offered to throw up a bear line to hang our food. It was hilarious entertainment. After 8 or so tries, they finally got it, and we observers lavished praise upon them. That is, after we all hooted and hollered!Cozy in my hammock, there were a few pitter pats of rain, but it didn't amount to anything other than music to sleep to.","Chesnut Knob Shelter

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534962,"I slept so well last night it was easy to get up at 6:30 am. Backpack loaded, I joined the others at the picnic table to make breakfast. The sun came out and we enjoyed watching a Nuthatch feeding her babies in a nearby tree. Also in the eave of the shelter was another mama bird sitting on a nest. Kangapard set off by 8 while I lingered over my morning tea. The trail awaits and I couldn't put it off any longer. I was dreading a day of more rocks. Lo and behold, it was easy footing, all dirt and no rocks! Wheee...... I zoomed along. With my food whittled down to only one lunch left, the pack weight was no problem. It was a 2 mile climb up to the ridge, but then the trail evened out with gentle ups and downs and well graded switchbacks. I made 4.5 miles in just 2 hours, wow!I came out onto VA 615 and there was trail magic! A woman, named Mickey, greeted me, asking if I would like a hot breakfast. What? Of course I would, but I was trying to catch up to Kangapard, so I declined. But I did ask her if she knew anything about slackpacking to Bland and she said no, but I can slackpack you today. Hooray! I accepted and Mickey drove another hiker, Dulsie, and me into Bland to the motel where I had a reservation for tonight. I was permitted to put my pack in the room, even though it wasn't ready. Then Mickey drove us back to the trail, gave us grocery bags to put our water and lunches into and hugged us goodbye. She sectioned hiked the AT, finishing last June after working away at it for 9 years on school vacations. Mickey is an amazing woman and I was so grateful to have met her.I had 6.9 miles left to go for the day and I set off, racing up the trail. I just could not believe my good fortune. The trail allowed for a fast pace and I finished up by 2 pm. I got to the road and there was Kangapard, sitting with Dulsie, who had passed me. She was irritated that she had missed the slackpacking, but she was offered a hot breakfast, but had turned it down. Our shuttle driver was not available to pick us up, so we headed down the road for 2.5 miles to the motel. I stuck my thumb out to hitch and finally a pickup truck stopped and added us to the two hikers already inside. Now I am happily tucked into a hotel room, watching it rain some more. I have arranged for us to slackpack another section tomorrow and return to the hotel, as my boots have not arrived as promised. Then Wednesday it will be back to lugging the backpack, but the weather is supposed to clear and warm up. Tomorrow will be fun!","Jenkins Shelter

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534963,"It is a gorgeous morning. As Bubba, our shuttle driver, drove us up to the trailhead at Rt 52, the fog was still hanging in the low valley areas. It is so pretty to see the ridges and mountains rise up out of the fog. After one mile of road walking we came to the turn off to head back into the woods. Parked there was a man providing trail magic: hot coffee, sweet cinnamon rolls and juice. Even though we had only hiked one mile, we stopped for a cinnamon bun and chatted a bit. Then it was time to start climbing up out of the gap and onto the ridge.The trail in this section is well maintained and enables you to move along rapidly. There were no views again, but the highlight was at the top of Brushy Mountain, a stone reminder that we are crossing the 600 mile mark! The trail then turned downhill for 2.9 miles to where the trail crosses Rt. 608. We were an hour early so it gave us time to rest and stretch. Bubba arrived a little before 3 pm and returned us to the motel.I was relieved to get back to the motel as I am having some major intestinal distress! It is probably food poisoning, not norovirus, and will resolve soon, but I am not taking any chance. I am going to give my body a rest by getting a shuttle to Woods Hole Hostel in Pearisburg, VA, thus missing 20.5 miles of trail. This is unfortunate, as I was looking forward to seeing Dismal Falls, after hearing how pretty it is, but paying attention to my health is a top priority and critical if you want to make it all the way to Maine......","Bland, VA

First we dropped Kangapard off at the trailhead at Rt. 608 and by 8:15 am I was delivered to Woods Hole Hostel. Fortunately I was in time for breakfast and found I was able to eat everything put in front of me. So far, so good.Much to my surprise I found Heisenberg here. She was due to leave today but has been having a terrible time with blisters on her feet and can barely walk, so she will be here tonight as well. Also here is StormCrow, whom I met way back in March at the Hiker Hostel in GA. I had been wondering about him and suddenly here he is! We caught up over breakfast, then he is off to slackpack a section today, returning to the hostel tonight.Woods Hole Hostel is an incredible place. It is an organic farm, plus hostel. It has pigs, cows, goats and chickens. There are vegetables growing on hillsides and in front of the farmhouse. It is so well maintained and clean, it is a joy to be here. To sweeten the deal, they also offer meals, massage, yoga and meditation. Right now it is relatively quiet as most of the hikers have returned to the trail. I imagine about 4 ish, a new batch will come hiking in as they are fully booked tonight. I have a spot in the bunk house and tomorrow will move into the main farmhouse. Kangapard, Dulsie and I will share a private room. My laundry is being done for me while I relax on the porch of the bunkhouse with a cup of tea.Today's agenda: catch up on my journal, rest and eat.","VA608

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535109,"I awoke to the sound of hikers packing up and getting ready to head out. Some were getting back to the trail, one was leaving the trail for good and returning home and others were being shuttled into Pearisburg to do errands and hike north from there.Breakfast was not being served this morning, so I fired up my stove and made my tea and oatmeal. Taking it to the porch of the bunkhouse, I climbed into the hammock and ate while watching the activity going on in the yard. Ducks were leaving the pond and walking up to the driveway to where their ""duck house"" is. The goats had somehow jumped their fence and were gamboling around the yard, chased by the owners of the establishment. One goat tried to enter the bunkhouse, but was chased away by an employee. All the goats suddenly dashed up the hill to their pen, hearing the sound of the food can being rattled. Thankfully the cows, pigs and chickens were behaving themselves in their own areas.Soon the hikers all departed and the hostel quieted down. I used the time to take a shower, reorganize my pack and start to work on making up food packets for when we leave on Saturday.One of the dogs began barking, alerting everyone that a hiker was approaching. I looked up, and here comes Jim. He's a section hiker we have camped with the last few shelters. He had come in to charge his phone, buy some homemade bread and left. Kangapard was the next one to arrive, and got settled into our room in the main house. Next up come Jack Rabbit and Buzzard. They also have been at the last few shelters with us. Now there is a nice group here, and we are having a ball making fun of Buzzard for hiking an extra mile in the wrong direction! He takes the teasing well, and he knows that he is not the only one who has done such a thing.Tomorrow will be another R and R day. I am beginning to feel better and have been trying to eat more. To pump up the calorie count today I just polished off a one quart smoothie made with ice cream, milk, banana and peaches. It took an hour to consume, but I got it all down.

I stayed in bed until the very last call for breakfast, then dashed down to join the circle of thanks. All the guests gather with the owner on the lawn, form a circle and hold hands. Then we observe a moment of silence, broken by the owner with a statement of your name and naming one thing for which you are thankful. It was a tradition begun by the owner's, Neville, grandmother who created this farm. It's a nice way to start the day and even nicer is the wonderful breakfast that follows.My intestinal distress has been resolved, but I started with a sore throat last night and it didn't go away. My body must really be tired! After helping clean up after breakfast, I went back to bed to read. Then I remembered that my new boots arrived yesterday and I thought I would go for a walk in them, testing their comfort and my endurance. Up the hill I went toward where the AT crosses the road. Wow, have I been off the trail that long? It was a good test for both, and I think the boots did the best.The rest of the day will be spent resting and reading. Tomorrow I head out towards Pearisburg. Hopefully I will be able to slack pack it, which will be an easier way to get back into it after being sick.

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535561,"What a morning! Got up, took the linens off my bed, made the bed as we were requested to do, packed up my backpack and my bounce box, and took everything downstairs in the hostel. I had taken everything out of my backpack since I was going to slackpack today to Pearisburg. All of my equipment was thrown into a giant garbage bag to go into the back of the owner's car to be transported to the hotel in Pearisburg. Then all I needed to carry was my backpack, my lunch and some water. I was looking forward to a big breakfast this morning to start me off on my journey when Neville, the owner, came out and announced the stove is broken, and there will be no breakfast. Apparently they had no back-up plan either. I had to untie my bounce box and fish through it for some packets of oatmeal and tea, so I had something to eat before hiking. This was one of the inconsistencies in the service at the hostel. There was one other morning where breakfast suddenly wasn't available. I'm not sure how a business can operate like this and still be successful.
I finally finished my breakfast and left about 8:15. This was to be my first day hiking after 3 days of rest, and I was a little anxious about how my body would handle it. It turned out the hardest part was walking up the hill from the hostel to the beginning of the trail. After that the trail was relatively even with a few moderate climbs up to a spot called Angel Rock. I had lunch at a beautiful rocky overlook. I'm not sure the picture above does it justice. It was all downhill into Pearisburg. At first the downhill part was climbing through rock mazes, but then it moved out to a nice trail for the most part. Down near the bottom it became very muddy and slick, and the day hikers coming up were fun to watch as they slid in the mud trying to ascend. They all looked very hot as well and out of breath. I, on the other hand, was using my poles to break my downward momentum, and trying not to go too fast, while saving the stress on my knees.
At the first road crossing Kid caught up with me. He is a young man with whom we had shared the room the previous night. His grandfather is here in the area visiting and met him at various locations to give him a night off the trail in a motel. We happened to meet Grandfather at our last motel in Bland, where he was asking us questions about how to find the trail, and talking to us about his grandson. It was fun to finally make the connection and meet the grandson. Bingo! I asked if I could possibly get a ride in with him, and he said of course. Kindness pays off, you see, as the previous night I had sewn a button on this young man shorts. I think he understood without my saying that if I didn't get a ride, the button would magically pop off his shorts and disappear into the grass! We got to the point where we were supposed to meet Grandpa at 2 p.m., and I was in the hotel room by 2:30. It was a huge relief to get here as I found I was very tired, probably still recovering from being sick. I relaxed the rest of the afternoon, and then I walked across the street to the Mexican restaurant to get my dinner. I continued to try and calorie load, and ordered an extra serving of guacamole, yum! Also while we were here, we met an interesting woman,69, by the name of Soul Flower. She is from out west, and she has been hiking the trail to the tune of 18 to 20 miles a day. I find this just amazing as I can barely manage 12 to 14. We had a nice time learning about her, and then who should come walking across the street but Pops! He had just returned from a family reunion in Manassas and was spending the night as well. We all made arrangements to meet on the trail tomorrow and stay at the same stealth camp tomorrow night. It is now hiker midnight, 8 p.m., and I am going to bed.","Woods Hole Hostel

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536056,"I slept so well last night, it was easy to get up at 6 am. Kid and his Grandfather were to arrive at 8:30 am to give us a ride back to the trail. I cooked breakfast right there in the room, packed up my backpack and still had time to lounge a bit. Grandfather arrived a little early and watche dwith amusement as the three of us crammed ourselves, hiking poles and overloaded backpacks into his small car. It was even funnier on the other end when he opened the doors and we tumbled out like a circus act! Getting ourselves sorted out, packs on, poles ready, we posed for the required photos, hugged Grandfather goodbye and headed uphill.The first part of the hike took us up and over a hill, past an old cemetary and crossing the Senator Shumate bridge over the New river before turning us uphill into the woods. The trail parelleled a landfill and when we crossed a creek, there was a big sign: NOT POTABLE WATER. Thankfully we didn't need any at that point. The rest of the morning was spent continuing uphill to the Rice Field shelter, about 6 1/2 miles m,ore. We arrived about 1 pm and I was whipped. The weather was warm and humid and while I was carrying only 3 1/2 days of food, it felt unusually heavy. I made sure to keep drinking as I was sweating a lot from the effort. When we got to the shelter, Pops was already there as was Soul Flower. I dropped my pack and told Kangapard that I needed at least an hour to rest and eat. I wanted to heat water to make some broth to drink with my lunch, hoping that it would revive me a bit. Pops quickly set up his stove and kindly boiled me some water while I rested. While we ate, we all discussed where to camp tonight, given the dirth of available water. We decided to head for Symm's Gap, filling up on water at a source 1.5 miles beforehand.Off we set. A sign informed us that as we walked the ridge, our left foot was in West Virginia while our right foot was in Virginia! Pops outdistanced us quickly as I started to drag almost immediately. Then my nose started to run. Ugh, allergies? Sneeze, sniff, honk. Why is it hiker's noses run and their feet smell, when it should be the other way around! On the map it looked like it was going to be a nice ridgewalk without anymore climbing. It was a ridge walk, but over the most irritating terrain we have seen yet! Gosh, it was slow going. We got to the water source and I filled up my 2 liter bottles as well as another 32 oz bag. I looked longingly at the campsites in that area and thought I would be very happy to stop right there! But stopping meant even more miles tomorrow and that generally isn't a good choice. Onward we went. Poor Kangapard! I dragged along behind her gasping,wheezing and blowing my nose inbetween requesting rest breaks. At least she knew it wasn't a bear! After 3 miles we came out onto the top of a ridge onto a meadow, through an old orchard and suddenly there was Pops at the campsite. What a view! You can see clear across the valley to the mountains beyond. In the distance, the clouds were gray and looked like rain might come this was. We hurriedly set up and sat down to prepare dinner.
Looking into my food bag I realized nothing looked appealing, so I got water boiling to have more broth. Pops and Kangapard raised a ruckus that I wasn't cooking a meal and Pops made me take some of his ramen to add to my soup. It did taste pretty good and I ate it all, followed by some snack crackers and granola bars. It is interesting that all this hiking makes you so hungry, burns tons of calories yet makes you so queasy you have to force feed yourself. I have met and read about other hikers experiencing this same problem. 
As we were eating two hikers came rolling in and quickly set up as it started to sprinkle. Then a thrid hiker travelling SOBO joined us. It was getting crowed as the camping area is limited due to the rocks. Owl and his pal (never did catch his name) had come from Pearisburg , just as we had. I headed to bed at 6:30 pm,to read and rest, as did Pops and Kangapard. Not long after the sound of music from a ukelele was heard! Owl was sitting by the fire ring playing and singing softly. He is very talented! On an unfortunate note, his pal was busy emptying his gut of the ""all you can eat"" Chinese food he consumed before leaving town. This continued hourly until the wee hours of the morning. Poor thing was a wreck in the morning, and what a time to be without a water source to rehydrate. (note to self: avoid Chinese food from unknown restaurants!)
Around 9 pm I heard oohs and ahhs and I climbed out of my hammock to see what everyone was seeing. It was the most gorgeous sunset: oranges, reds and yellow streaks across the sky. It had to be the highlight of the day! Back to bed I went, with the poor kid retching every hour, my stuffy nose and chills, sleep was bound to be elusive......","Pearisburg

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536065,"I woke up this morning at 5 am, looked out the foot of my hammock at a beautiful sunrise. It was so peaceful. The sound of a cow mooing off in the distant valley drifted up to the campsite.Before going to bed last night I had decided I needed to get off the trail as soon as possible. It is apparent that I am not feeling quite right and have been losing strength and energy over the last few weeks. I need to get some lab work done and see why I am feeling so poorly. But when I woke up, I felt a little better and began to second guess my decision.After breakfast we loaded up and set off. It didn't take long to realize that I really did need an exit plan, and soon. One of the hikers at camp last night recommended a shuttle driver. I called him and made arangements to be picked up. Unfortunately I still had to hike the 6.5 miles out to the road, the nearest accessible area. Again, Kangapard had to tow me up hill and down dale. We took a mandatory rest break every hour. There was no water in this stretch of trail so we had to both ration our water. This was not a great position to be in on another warm, humid day. Finally we got to the trailhead to the parking lot and I thanked Kangapard for her care and patience, and stumbled down the path to the waiting shuttle. Kangapard continued on the trail, now unfettered.My ride dropped me at a moted. I am in Pearisburg once again! I spent the remainder of the afternoon making phone calls and figuring out how to best resolve this. After many consultations with family and friends, the plan is in place. My sister and her husband are coming to pick me up, take me home with them and see that I get the proper medical evaluation as well as some needed R and R.Am I off the trail for good? I hope not!I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, Readers, for following my journey and for your unwavering support.

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538894,"Such sad news I received while off the trail these last two weeks. I first met Sonja and Bernd back in the Smokies. They came from Germany to hike from Springer to Harper's Ferry after which they were to travel through the US to see the country before their visa ran out. Our paths crossed numerous times, sharing shelters, forest fires in Hot Springs, leapfrogging our way up the trail. They are both strong hikers and moved along quickly, so they outdistanced me by a week by the time we got to Virginia. The sad news is that Bernd passed away in his sleep while on an overnight at a motel in Daleville, VA. My friend, Pops, was a day north of Daleville when he got the call from Sonja. He was sitting trailside processing this horrible news, trying to figure out a way back to Daleville quickly, when along comes another hiker, LoudMouth (who is anything but that!) and LoudMouth says ""come on, my parents are picking me up at the road in 5 miles and we can give you a ride"". Off they flew down the trail, and in a relatively short period of time, Pops was delivered to Sonja's motel to help her tackle the funeral arrangements, rental car and flight back to Germany. Isn't it wonderful how good things come along to soften the blow of the bad.I feel so fortunate to have known Bernd, even for such a short time, and I will miss him. His command of English was minimal, but he always had a twinkle in his eye and a smile, as he tried to makes jokes in English. He didn't particularly enjoy the backpacking like Sonja did, but he loved her, so there he was. That is true love.On a happier note, after what will be 21 days of rest and eating, I have regained enough weight to return to the trail! Hooray! My sister and her husband took great care of me, feeding me constantly (reminding me of the way parent birds feed their young!) and forcing me to rest. I am so grateful for their assistance and support. I did get in some walking, a couple of exercise classes and some practice hikes with my pack. Now it is time to put myself to the test. I am headed back to Virginia, picking up at Elkwallow Wayside in the Shenandoahs, for a 4 day section. This area allows for a couple of good bail out points, if needed. Hopefully, all will go well and I will continue northward towards Harper's Ferry. Stay tuned……………..","Rochester NY

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541036,"Hooray! I am back on the trail today. I managed to gain 8 pounds back while at my sister's house. She did a great job rehabilitating me, tough as it was! In keeping with my new ""food loading"" mentality, I ate an enormous breakfast of french toast, hash browns, scrambled eggs, bacon and juice. That should hold me for awhile.I set off about noon, just as the day was getting hot and steamy. The trail followed Rt. 522 for a bit before turning uphill into the woods. I passed lots of raspberry bushes, but they were on the other side of a very tall chain link fence and I just couldn't get my arm (skinny as it is) through far enough to reach the ripe ones! The trail bordered a creek and the area was lush and boggy. The bugs were swarming, sweat was dripping. There was absolutely no breeze for relief. Covering myself with DEET, I marched on, feeling pretty good. My legs and feet remembered what to do as I kicked it into hiker gear, climbing up towards the Colonel John Mosby campsite at 2000 feet. Realizing that I was barreling along, panting and dripping, it occurred to me to slow down. Duh. I only had to hike 5.2 miles today and I sure didn't need to do it in one hour! I stopped and rested on a cool, damp rock, then started again, a little smarter. At the top, the trail became more enjoyable as pine needles softened the footing and downhill I cruised.I stopped at Mosby creek to replace my chlorinated town water (ugh) with cold mountain water from the creek. Ahh, I sure missed good clean water. I only met one hiker on the trail today, going southbound. We stopped to chat and I asked the young man what that orange tag was hanging off his pack. He told me it was a thing (orange plastic square tag) to repel insects, that farmers use them on cows. He said he hadn't had a problem since he got it in Harper's Ferry a few days ago. Then he pulled another one out of his pack and offered it to me. Being as I am truly bug bait, I was willing to try anything at this point. Not having anyway to hang it, I jammed it into my pants pocket, thanked him and continued on my way. For those of you bovine farmers/ranchers out there, maybe you can enlighten me as to whether or not these things work. I figure they are probably as toxic as heck, but it did seem to diminish the swarm engulfing me at the time. It just seems to me that if they were meant to work for humans, wouldn't more people know about them? Hmmm.Before I knew it, I was at the turnoff for the shelter. I walked down the path and couldn't believe my eyes! I want to live here! It's made of logs, it's clean, it has a big Adirondack chair on its front porch! It has a cooking pavilion. It has a solar shower. It has a privy. It has a bear pole. Who could possibly ask for anything more? To top it off, I was the only one there. Peace and quiet supreme! I scouted around and picked a spot away from the shelter to hang my hammock, then went to check out the shower. Down a path,facing away from the shelter is a booth-like structure, with a big plastic oil drum suspended above, to hold the water. A hose is attached to the bottom of the drum. The hope is that the sun will heat the water. With no one around, it was the perfect opportunity to make use of the shower and get the bug repellent, sweat and grit off. It was just heavenly and as I was so hot from hiking, I didn't even mind that the sun did NOT heat the water!Clean is good.Clean and sitting in an Adirondack chair with a snack and a cup of tea is even better! I sat and relaxed and thought about how good it is to be back on the trail again. Soon hikers started drifting in, some to rest until the sun went down, then they continue hiking until dark or later! Some came to stay. One of the hikers offered me some fresh sweet cherries and I gave her an avocado in exchange (now carrying them to boost the calories!). Eating the cherries made me feel like summer has begun! One of the hikers who came in tonight is Chef Ducky, who I have known for a few months, our paths crossing here and there. We cooked our dinner together and took the opportunity to catch up on her hike and the people we have in common.It was really enjoyable getting to know her better and learn more about her. She has now dropped about 60 pounds and is feeling better and stronger than ever. I am so impressed with her tenacity.I ate a lot for dinner tonight, including an avocado. They really are a tasty treat, and how wonderful to be able to eat them with abandon. Too bad they weight so much, sigh.

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541187,"Slept great last night for a first night back on the trail! This is such a lovely shelter area, it is difficult to get moving. I got myself packed up and went to the cooking pavilion to make breakfast. It was nice having a leisurely morning, chatting with other hikers that had arrived after I retired to my hammock. I was surprised that I knew quite a few of them. Getting to see people I met months ago is one of the benefits of jumping ahead on the trail. Of course the downside is having to return to hike sections missed!The trail north of the shelter headed downhill. What a nice change from the usual morning uphill climb. However, there is always a climb somewhere and the map listed a small climb to a ridge top clearing, that had a bench and offered a view. It sounded like a great place to stop for a morning snack and I was excited to make use of the bench! Coming out of the woods, I got to the top of the grassy ridge and began making my way across. I was surprised to see a SUV parked along the trail, and stopped to talk to the man doing trail maintenance. I asked him if he knew where a bench was along this section, and as you can see in the picture, he knew exactly where it was! Buried under a tree that had fallen. I was sooo disappointed, and asked him to hurry up with the sawing and get that tree outta my way! We had a good chuckle over that. I learned his name is Gray Ghost, that he made that bench, as well as all the footbridges and bog walkways in this section of trail! How great is that! I thanked him for all his work in maintaining the trail and told him how much I was enjoying the good footing. He is also an avid hiker, and will be heading southbound to Springer next week. Gray Ghost gave me a rundown on what to expect in the next few miles and I went on my way, smiling. The people I meet out here are incredible!Onward I went, down the switchbacks leading to Manassas Gap. I was about halfway down when I heard crash, crash, crash! I stopped. I listened again to be sure, I looked around carefully,seeing nothing. Hmmm. Mighty big noise, thankfully moving away from where I was standing, and it meant BEAR! Not seeing it, I proceeded slowly ahead, and took a deep breath, reminding myself that it was moving away, and that it could have been a clumsy deer. Not!Since my snack bench had been compromised in such an unfortunate manner, I aimed my sights at Manassas Gap, where there was a parking area, a stream and maybe someplace to sit and rest. Lo and behold, after walking through the parking area, there was a picnic table occupied by a couple of hikers, with room for me. I sat next to a young man, who looked awfully familiar, but I just couldn't place him. His name, Southwind, didn't give me any clues either. Finally I admitted that I couldn't place him and he told me the last time I saw him was the night at Symm's Gap - he was the kid who vomited all night! ( what a way to be remembered!) It was great to see him again, and looking so much better. We commiserated on how miserable we each felt that night and laughed about how awful it was. Also at the table were Tsai and Older Dog. I first met them both way back at Lance Creek in Georgia. Older Dog I saw again at Wood's Hole Hostel where he was taking a zero to recover from a cold. Sitting around gabbing wasn't getting us down the trail, so one by one we packed up our snacks and left. Gray Ghost had warned me about an area of blow downed trees and sure enough, climbing out of Manassas Gap was an obstacle course mess of trees. A super storm had gone through the week before, and the trail crews had done what they could to make the trail passable, but there is really so much work to do it would probably take a year. 
It was slow going and I arrived at Manassas Gap shelter for a late lunch about 2 pm. The piped water source was flowing well so I filled up my bottles. I had promised my feet some time out of boots, so I put on my Crocs and hung my socks out to dry. Ahhhh. A section hiker arrived with his dog off leash. The hound jumped up on me, slobbering all over while his owner is telling me not to pet him as he has been into poison ivy. Great. How about you leash your darn dog and keep it off of me! I love dogs, but cannot stand irresponsible owners. Soon they both left, and I went and washed my arms and legs, praying for no poison ivy, as I am highly allergic to it. The dog's barking was replaced by voices coming down the trail to the shelter, and who should it be but Storm Crow, one of my favorite people! He was with a father and son, (Shake and Bake, respectively) and Bake's two buddies. They were slackpacking this section and looking mighty pleased with themselves! Storm Crow I met at Hiker Hostel in Dahlongena, Ga, back in March. Then I saw him at Wood's Hole Hostel back before I got off the trail. He is doing well and continues to lose the weight as he wanted.
After an hour of lunch, rest and conversation, it was time to get back to it. The trail improved from here and I was able to make good time, even with frequent rest stops to snack. I got to Dick's Dome shelter about 4:30 pm and was not impressed at all. It is a small, dome shaped shelter that was an Eagle Scout project. Unfortunately it sat in a low area by the creek, so it was dark and buggy. A new shelter is being built up the hill from it, and I wandered up there to see what that area was like. Big Heart (a section hiker) is here as well, and we decided this is the place to be even though it is not completed. It has a roof and a covered front porch with a picnic table. There are also two reclining camp chairs! Big Heart set up inside the shelter on the unfinished floor and I went up further to scout out my hammock trees and get set up. It is lighter and a nice breeze here and no bugs so this shelter will be a good one to revisit in the future. I took my food bag back to the shelter and began dinner prep by having a cup of tea while sitting in the recliner chair with my feet up! Now this is camping!!
It was a very pleasant evening. Big Heart shared his Mountain House Apple Crisp with me as we watched hikers roll in. Two other tents joined him in the shelter, and more joined me up the hill. There were probably about 15 people in the area tonight.
The sky is clear and I don't think rain is expected, so I am going to leave my door flaps of my tarp open so I can look out at the woods as I fall asleep.","Jim and Molly Denton Shelter

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541194,"What a beautiful morning. I awoke to the musical call of the wood thrush. Looking at my watch I saw it was only 6 am, so I rested in my hammock enjoying the birds' songs. Today was going to be a short mileage day (8.0 mi.) so I took my time packing up. After making my tea and oatmeal on the covered porch of the new unfinished shelter, I sunk into one of the camp chairs again. ahh, the delights of eating breakfast in a comfy chair while everyone else is packing up! Soon the crowd left and a blissful silence fell over the area. It was very difficult to leave, but I finally hiked out at 9:15 am.It was a very steep climb of 0.2 mi. out of the shelter area, but I still made good time as the trail was well maintained. Looking up, I see a man running towards me. It's 46'er! Now I have to tell you, even though that is his real trail name, I call him ""the Running Gnome"". That is what he looks like, and that is what he does. He is in his 70's! Our paths have been crossing since northern Tennesee, and I didn't expect to ever see him again as I have been off the trail for about 3 weeks and he should have been further ahead. We always stop to say hello, and catch up, and I learned that he and his wife had also gotten off the trail for family obligations and had just returned. Now, the interesting part of this story is this: his 70 yr old wife is thru hiking the trail, and he is slackpacking her. They have a vehicle. He drops her off at the trailhead in the morning, then he drives north to the next appropriate trailhead. He parks the car, and he RUNS south to meet her along the way, then he keeps her company hiking back to the car!This is why I keep seeing him running south as I move north. Isn't that the greatest! He also gives me a trail report and tells me that there is good trail to come.Sure enough as I approach the Sky Meadows State Park area, the rocks in the trail disappear and grass takes it's place. Coming out of the woods, the trail crosses large meadow areas, travels down an old dirt road and in general, is such enjoyable hiking. There are lots of water crossings, so I don't have to carry much water weight. 
With the trail conducive to fast hiking, I found myself at my destination shelter by 2 pm and Deny, from Canada, was already there, flaked out in the shelter. Yesterday at Dick’s Dome shelter he and I discussed the wisdom of hiking early, resting during the hottest hours and hiking again in the late afternoon. So, true to his word, here he was. I spread out my sleeping pad, took off my boots and socks to dry out, and lay back to enjoy the shade and coolness of the shelter. We starting discussing the merits of continuing on, but we’re both wary of the upcoming terrain, as it was the start of the area known as the “Roller Coaster”, 13 miles of rocky, short, but steep, ascents and descents. There was a camping area listed in the guide book, but we were uncertain as to how large it was, given the number of hikers headed there today. While I ate my lunch, I scouted around the shelter area. There were tent platforms, a good flowing piped spring and uphill from the shelter was a wonderful wooded clearing with perfect hammock trees. Decision made, I am staying here. 
Returning to the shelter, I was finishing off my lunch when up walked two hikers, Nature (a man in his 60’s), Hash Brown (a 20-something) and Hash’s dog. Hash Brown hollers out “Don’t pet the dog, he’s been in poison ivy”. Great, here we go again! I pull my legs up into the shelter and Dog passes me by and goes off searching out great smells in the bushes. Hash Brown comes to the shelter and throws his pack down on the floor between Deny and me. We chat a bit, then looking at his pack I notice animal furs hanging off of it, smelling really bad! I asked him what the heck he had hanging off his pack, and he replied “oh, those are a raccoon and a woodchuck pelts”. Ugh! Yuck! In a dubious voice I asked “so, are you like hunting as you hike?” He said “no, my dog killed them, so I skinned them out and me and Nature ate ‘em and I’m keepin’ the pelts”. Ohhhhh, wow. He must have noticed the horrified look on my face as I inched away from his pack, because he picked it up and walked it away. But here’s the kicker: he took it over to the cooking pavilion and set it down on the picnic table. Yes, the very one where we all prepare our food!! I had seen enough, so I grabbed my pack and walked up the hill a bit and set up my hammock for the night. I have a beautiful area, lots of trees, and no bushes to harbor bugs. There is a wonderful breeze coming through and it is cool. By now it is getting to be dinner time according to my stomach, even though it was only 4 pm. I dreaded returning to the cooking pavilion and the discussion I might have to have about nasty animal pelts on a cooking surface, but I was spared! Deny informed me that they had left after they had a snack. Whew! Well, you can bet this fastidious Frances got out her wet wipes and gave the table a good scrub!
While I had been setting up, more hikers rolled in and I was soon joined at the table by a young woman from Texas who was section hiking SOBO and a nice couple who had gotten on at Harper’s Ferry and were hiking SOBO, as far as they could in the one week they had. We had a wonderful time discussing the trail, what food we had, and what we had to look forward to as we travelled in our various directions. They had all just about completed the Roller Coaster, and I was about to get into the nitty-gritty of it. 
It is 6:30 pm and I am going to climb into my hammock to read for a bit. The barometer is rising, the humidity is disappearing and the sky is clear. It is a beautiful night and I am going to sleep with my tarp off for the first time! I am aiming to get up early and head through the Roller Coaster before it gets too hot. The Bear’s Den Hostel is my next stop, and if it is nice, I may even zero!","Dick's Dome Shelter

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541590,"What a great night's sleep. This was the first time since March 22 that I did not wear earplugs to sleep. I guess the gentle breeze rustling the trees made me feel so much at home I just zonked out. I woke to the sound of a wood thrush again, and got right up. It was 6 am and I wanted to get an early start to beat the heat. I packed up quickly and walked to the cooking pavilion to make my breakfast. I saw that Deny was already gone. He really believes in an early start!! Other hikers were just waking up and stumbling to the table to make coffee. I didn't chat much, instead I focused on eating, getting more water and hitting the trail. I was out of camp at a record time: 7:15 am.
The trail started off with .4 mi of downhill, then I came upon the infamous sign (see above photo). Time to begin the roller coaster. I counted 7 bumps I had to tackle before getting to Bear's Den, so I set to work, climbing and descending. Oh boy, was it rocky footing. This kind of hiking takes a lot of focus so as to not twist an ankle. But the woods were quiet, it was still cool and I moved along pretty well. Soon the humidity began to take its toll and I had to slow down and start taking frequent rests to snack and drink. There were plenty of streams and creeks along the way, so at least I didn't have to carry much water, and stopping to gather and filter was a nice excuse to rest some more. There is not much to see here, except rocks and trees, when up high, and boggy areas and creeks when down low. Most hikers just focus on ""gettin' it done"", and so did I.
I arrived at the Sam Moore shelter about 11 am, and Deny was here napping. He told me he left about 6 this morning and arrived here at 10 am. Time to eat and rest.Even though it was early, I was made lunch anyway, then joined Deny in the shelter to rest a bit. My mind kept drifting to the thought of a hot shower and some real food, and I decided that while lingering here, it was not going to get any cooler. With a sigh, I loaded up, told Deny I would see him later when he went flying by me (he was headed to the hostel as well) and headed out.
The “ups” were getting tougher, but now there is only one big one and one small one between me and Bear’s Den. I moved along slowly, resting often. This humidity just saps my strength and I am drenched in sweat. Pretty soon I heard a little pitter patter of rain, and thought this is going to be great, a nice little shower to cool me down, rinse me off and maybe lower the temperature! I stopped to put on my pack cover. Ok, I’m ready, let it pour! Immediately the rain stopped and the cloud moved away. Arrgh. I lower my head and just hike, mumbling “pizza and ice cream, pizza and ice cream” over and over again, until I notice that I am at a trail junction. I look up, and hooray! Here is the turnoff for the trail to Bear’s Den Hostel. Only 0.2 miles to go and and the trail turns into an old gravel road leading up to the driveway of the hostel.
Bear’s Den is very impressive looking, made of stone. There are massive stone pillars at the foot of the driveway and welcoming signs. I walk up to the front door, and rats! It doesn’t open until 5 pm. I have a half hour to wait, so I make myself comfortable in an Adirondack chair, happy to be sitting down and off my feet. Other hikers have gathered as well and we chat and swat bugs. Soon the door opens, and in we go to check in. The hiker special includes a bunk, laundry, and pizza and a pint of ice cream. Sign me up! I joined another woman, and her dog, in the female bunk room. Lynn is a hiker from Manhattan,NY, who is section hiking the AT with her guide dog, Ronda. Yep, I said “guide dog”. She is legally blind. Lynn started in the Shenandoah’s and is heading north. Truly courageous. 
The kitchen is chaotic as hikers move pizzas in and out of ovens at a rapid rate. I am sharing an oven with another hiker, so our pizzas are taking a bit longer. I am so hungry I am eyeballing my pint of ice cream. Now, I really am not a huge fan of ice cream. I do admit to liking a hot fudge sundae twice a year, and yes, I will eat a Dove ice cream bar if you twist my arm, but I happier without it. But in consideration of my new eating habits (ie. Eat everything in sight in order to keep weight on), I decide to take a bite or two to see how it tastes. Hazelnut chocolate chip, hmm, not bad. After a few more bites I am thinking, ok, I can probably eat about half of it and save the other half for tomorrow. Apparently my brain did not register the part about 'saving for tomorrow' and before I knew what happened, my spoon was clinking against the bottom. I just ate a whole pint of ice cream!! Without batting an eye! Then my pizza came out of the oven and I demolished that too! Life is good!","Rod Hollow Shelter

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541732,"Bears Den Hostel is a very interesting place. The following is a copy of their description:
1933 - Bears Den was built by Dr. Huron Lawson, a professor emeritus in obstetrics and gynecology at The George Washington University, and his wife, Francesca Kaspari, a soprano singer, as their summer home. The couple traveled to Europe and designed the home to replicate a faux Medieval castle. Dr. Lawson used the local stonemasons and built the home in three stages, with the last to be the turret in the back. The curved living room was designed for its acoustical properties and for Francesca's recital room. There are also two small stone structures near the day-use parking lot. One was used as a ticket booth because Dr. Lawson created a petting zoo and charged five cents as admission and for visitors to picnic and access the overlook. The other stone structure was, and still is, the well house.
1960s - The Lawsons enjoyed their summer home until the late 1960s when they died. The Assateague Island Realty Corporation, owned by the Rodenbergs, purchased 620 acres of land from Route 601 down to the west side of the ridge almost to the Shenandoah River and planned to develop it for a country club-like community. They built one home and the foundation for others, as well as a swimming pool, but they didn't get much further than that. Clarke County turned them down for their proposal because of septic issues and disapproved of the swimming pool. Without the permits, they knew the venture would not be profitable, so they put the entire track of land on the market for $1 million.
1984 - Bears Den sat empty for 20 years, although there was a caretaker living in it on and off and the overlook continued to be popular with visitors. At the same time that the Lawsons died and the Rodenbergs failed at their development attempts, much of the Appalachian Trail (AT) was still situated on private lands, especially in northern Virigina. The Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) and the National Park Service were working together to move the trail off roads and private lands and into the forest. Part of the Rodenberg land was perfect for achieving that goal. Ultimately, after a lot of back and forth, the AT was rerouted into the forest and became known as the infamous ""Roller Coaster"" and the PATC bought 66 acres that included the lodge and cottage on April 3, 1984. Then, on June 12, 1984, the ATC purchased the property from the PATC at cost.
Today - The ATC is still the owner, but has had different entities manage the property over the years. In 2007, the PATC took over management and works cooperatively with the ATC to operate Bears Den Trail Center as a nonprofit organization. Bears Den offers an array of services, including a hostel with full services, accommodations for group or private party rentals/retreats, a primitive campground and a rustic cottage for rent. The 2,184.2-mile AT is just 150 yards from the lodge.
Who wouldn’t want to take a zero day here! There is a free pancake breakfast (make your own) and the host provided fresh blueberries to add to the batter. Delicious! I finished eating and was working on my cup of tea, sitting in the living room, when who should come walking in, but Kangapard! I was wondering if I might see her as I knew she was a day behind me since I jumped back on the trail in Front Royal, Va. Cranberry (a woman from Switzerland), and Beef Jerky (not sure where he is from) came in with her. Kangapard sat down and blasted through a pint of ice cream while we caught up. Ice cream does not appeal to me at 8 in the morning, but I have learned that she never lets the clock stand between her and ice cream! It is a good lesson! They were headed to the David Lesser shelter today which would put them in a good position to arrive at Harper’s Ferry the next morning. Kangapard’s sister was going to pick them up and drive Kanga and Beef Jerky to Maine to do a flip-flop (summiting Katahdin and then hike southbound back to Harper’s Ferry). Cranberry was continuing northbound. I have no doubt Kangapard will be successful in her thru hike as she has become a very strong hiker.
The remainder of the day was restful. I spent most of my time reading, relaxing and then working of food prep for the next two days. Bear’s Den does slackpacking, so I separated out what I would need to day hike to my next stop, the Blackburn Center. I also made a major decision regarding my hike. While I am feeling better after gaining some of my weight back, I am still not 100%, so I need to go home and take the time to pack on some more pounds. I am very disappointed that I don’t have the endurance to see me through this thru hike. I guess my body is better suited for “middle distance” rather than a marathon! So I am not going to fight it any longer. I have made flight reservations to return home to Florida for a few weeks. I am not giving up totally, I just need to redesign my hike to suit my physicality. I spent the rest of the evening getting to know Hazel, who is from Nova Scotia. I have always wanted to visit that area and now I have a reason! Hazel and I discussed the merits of slackpacking. Given that her sister has just sent her a 2 pound resupply of beef jerky, and she had added other food to her pack, she saw the wisdom in slacking to the Blackburn Center and picking her pack up there. We decided to hike together tomorrow through the remainder of the roller coaster. It will be nice to have some company!","Bear's Den Hostel

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541812,"I slept so well last night I was raring to go this morning. Got up at 6 am, made breakfast and I ate on the front porch of the hostel. It is nice and cool so we should have a good hike. Our packs got picked up at 7 am to be shuttled, and Hazel left while I took care of some last minute details. 
There are three more bumps to go on the roller coaster, reminding me of the 3 bears. There is a small baby bump, a medium Mamma one and a big, steep Papa of a one leading up to Raven Rocks, where there was a nice view. I caught up to Hazel at Snickers Gap, a road crossing where a Trail Angel was giving out all sorts of wonderful trail magic. I picked up some grapes, a bag of potato chips and drank an orange juice. This will make the day even more enjoyable! Hazel and I continued on together, chatting on the downhills and puffing and panting on the uphill. It was warming up fast as the sun rose above the ridges. We finally got to the end of the Roller Coaster and found ourselves up on a ridge for a couple of miles. Even though it was a little rocky, you could still find good foot placement, and we moved along well. Soon the path widened, trail grooming was evident and when you see that, you know you are close to a major trail intersection. In this case, it was the side trail to the Blackburn AT Center. Switchbacks took us down 0.2 miles to the Center, and what a beautiful sight-a screened in front porch, with comfortable, padded chairs, a swing and lounge chairs! No one was around, so we made ourselves comfortable at the picnic table to make lunch. Soon the caretaker, TrailBoss, showed up and retrieved our packs from inside the cabin. He and his wife live here during the season. He is very involved with trail maintenance and is responsible for the dreaded Roller Coaster. Besides the main cabin with the screened in porch, there is a hiker cabin, with 4 bunks, many tent platforms in the woods, a cooking pavilion, a privy and a solar shower! Standing on the front porch you looked east toward Washington, DC, downhill, following a power line. With a telescope, on a clear day, you can see the Washington Monument! 
Hazel downed her lunch, filled her water containers and we said goodbye. She was moving on to the next shelter (3 miles) or further if she was feeling strong. Before I arrived, I had decided to spend the night here, trying to keep my mileage low, and not overdo in the heat. But it was only noon, and I was really struggling to stay put. I went and found a good spot to set up my hammock, then took my book and made myself comfortable on the porch. As much as I was enjoying the surroundings, and the relaxing, I was feeling antsy and I probably could have moved on to the next shelter as well. A few hikers stopped in during the afternoon to fill up on water, as there is a lack of water on the trail in this section. I met Mariposa, who is slackpacking the trail, with her husband providing support, moving the vehicle, setting up camp and then hiking to meet her. She arrived a little torn up after falling on the rocks, but a shower and Neosporin fixed her right up. We made our dinners together and enjoyed each other’s company. About 7 pm, Lynn and her guide dog arrived and TrailBoss helped her get settled into the hiker cabin. It is another beautiful night and I will sleep without the tarp set up. Tomorrow, I slack pack into Harper’s Ferry, WVa!","Bear's Den Hostel

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541857,"It was another great night for sleeping. Even though the days have been hot and humid this week, the nights have been breezy and cool, perfect for sleeping. I was up by 6 am again, packed up and made breakfast. TrailBoss came out and gave me a couple of his special tea bags, so of course, I had to have another cup, or it would have been rude! Last night I had made arrangements with him to shuttle my backpack forward to the ATC headquarters in Harper’s Ferry so I could slackpack again today. This next mileage is renowned for being very dry, that is, 6 miles without a water source. I filled up my containers and put them in my loaner daypack with my lunch and headed out by 7:15.
I took the northern loop trail out of the Center, a steeper, but shorter trail joining back up with the AT. It certainly was steep, but also had a lot of stone steps to help. This area is so well maintained; the grass is cut back away from the trail at least 4 feet on each side. Markers and signs are plentiful too, letting the hiker know exactly where you are and how far you have to go. Thank you trail maintainers!! Once I got to the top of the ridge, there was a side trail to a viewpoint, so I took it and got a nice picture of the valley in the distance. The many wood thrushes kept me company, singing as I moved along. It was so peaceful and pretty. I descended down into a glen, crossing a boardwalk in the Laurel Springs area, as it zigged and zagged. On either side were masses of ferns. A fellow hiker caught up to me as I was sitting having a snack. Other than nodding hello, we didn’t talk, as we are all making tracks to get to the ATC headquarters in Harper’s Ferry. This is where you have your picture taken for the 2016 yearbook, and they tell you what number hiker you are to come through northbound this year. You can also register at the beginning at Springer Mtn. and get a starting number if you want. I didn’t do that, but know that I was in the 900 group based on the people I started with that did have numbers. (This means that by my start date March 22, 2016, some 900 hikers had started before me!!)
Today’s hike was not too strenuous. There were some small ups and downs, but mostly it was ridge walking the entire way. I did come down into Keys Gap, WVA Rt.9 and had to cross this busy road, but since it was still early, the traffic was not too bad. This is the only spot you can find water, and that is by going to a convenience store down this road one-half mile. I was well prepared so I didn’t need to worry about that. It was a climb uphill in a rocky area past a power line and back into the woods on a ridge again. Before I knew it, I was in the Loudon Heights region, once more crossing the Va/WVa state line. Now I am in WVa for good! The trail wound its way downhill and I could begin to hear traffic noise. Ahh, civilization was at hand! I passed clumps of day hikers making their way cautiously down over the rocks at various points. It was an organized group of Road Scholars out hiking. The trail comes out onto Rt 340, a busy 4 lane highway, taking you across the Shenandoah River on a bridge. It was most unpleasant walking the bridge, with traffic whizzing by at what seemed like great speeds!
I followed the blazes around the corner, across another road, and then uphill. I was pretty certain I had followed the trail correctly, but as I climbed the hill, the trail was all overgrown with weeds and there were no blazes to be found. I couldn’t believe I was in the right place, with such overgrowth. After all, I am not the first hiker through here, there have been at least a thousand! So why is the trail such a mess? I got so concerned, as it is now very hot and humid again, and I didn’t want to waste one single step. I stopped and pulled out my phone, brought up my Guthook map app and my gps to see exactly where I was relative to the trail. Sure enough, I am on the correct route, in fact; I am almost to the side trail to the ATC HQ. Whew. I pack my phone away, look up and hah, there is a white blaze on a tree staring right at me! Oh well, it is good to be reassured. Continuing on, I make the turn and soon find myself on the streets of Harper’s Ferry and at the front steps of the ATC HQ. 
Arriving at Harper’s Ferry is a big moment in many ways. It is known as the ‘half-way’ point for a thru hike, even though at mile 1022.5, it is not exactly. It is surely a mental half way point. It is a point at which many northbound hikes convert into flip-flops, jumping up to Katadhin and returning southbound. It is a point that long distance section hikers aim for. It is a starting point for hikers travelling southbound to do a long section. It is a point where hikers make major decisions: to continue on, to flip flop, to end their hike…….it is a revolving doorway to the great Appalachian Trail.
I have made my decision, difficult as it was. I am getting off the trail here, returning home to Florida for 3 weeks to, again, work on weight gain. Then I will resume hiking. I will first do a section in Virginia that I missed when I had food poisoning. Following that, I will head for the southern half of the Smokies, which I jumped in order to hike the northern half with my pal Crumpet. When that is completed, if I am still feeling strong, I am going to head to Maine and tackle the 100 mile Wilderness, which intrigues me the most, out of all the parts of the trail. My thru hike has been “redesigned” to suit my endurance level, and my interest. It may just be a whole lot more fun!","Blackburn AT Center

The bunkroom is clean, the bathrooms are clean and best of all the host serves an all you can eat waffle breakfast!I was glad I made a reservation for both nights, as the bunks filled up fast as the day progressed. Besides hikers, there are bicyclists here as well. Many of them are riding from DC to Pittsburgh, a 335 mile ride on the C & O Towpath and the Great Alleghany Passage. Now that sounds like fun! Of course, anything that doesn't involve walking sounds good about now!Hazel, Cranberry, Sam (section hiker from Texas) and I went to the Italian restaurant last night. It was sort of a farewell dinner as Sam was heading back to Texas, I was headed to Florida and Hazel and Cranberry were continuing northward. We had a fun time and it was so nice to get to know these women better. I hope to meet up with Hazel and Cranberry again, even if it is only to provide some trail magic as I drive up to Maine in August.I heard from my friends Jules and Denece yesterday. They are vacationing in the area and stopped by to make sure all was well. Today they came to pick me up and we will do some sightseeing together. They were going to cram me into the back of their car and give me a ride to Atlanta (a 9 hour jaunt!), but I decided it would be less painful to get to DC and fly home (a 2 hour flight). After seeing their car, not even fully loaded, we all realized it was a wise decision. We took the shuttle bus from the park to the historic section and started walking around looking at the old buildings and museum. We only lasted one hour before the idea of lunch was brought up. Walking does that to you! Needless to say, I was all over the idea of finding a restaurant and sitting outside, watching everyone else walk around, while we ate. So that is what we did. The temperature was climbing steadily, as was the humidity and an large ice tea was the perfect answer. As we were finishing, Cranberry walked in. I was so surprised to see her, as I thought she had already hit the trail. She joined us and ordered lunch. Jules and I were more interested in talking with Cranberry (from Switzerland) than wandering through shops, so we did that while Denece went down the street to find the outfitter's store. We were having a grand old time when it began to rain. It poured so hard that the outdoor porch roof leaked on us, so we bolted inside to try and get a seat. Taking the last table, it was only proper that we order dessert! Mmmmm, cherry cheesecake. I can feel the pounds sliding right back on, haha. We could think of no excuse to linger any longer, and there was a line of people waiting for a table, so we moseyed outside and said our goodbyes. Thankfully the rain stopped and I slowly walked up the steep hill to the hostel. On the way, I passed a yard where two deer were grazing. This is the most wildlife I have seen in one place on the whole trail, and it is in someone's yard! Back to the hostel, I started organizing my gear to repack into my backpack for the flight home. My biggest concern is that my poles don't get bent or damaged, but I think I can fit them inside my backpack. If all goes well, my shuttle driver, Mark, will pick me up in the morning at 11 am, deliver me to the airport, flight will be on time, shuttle on the Orlando end will be there and I will arrive home in The Villages by 9 pm, where I get to sleep in my very own bed .........","Harper's Ferry, WVA

Crumpet is coming from SC and tomorrow we will drive to Pearisburg, Va to do a 4 day hike from Bland to Pearisburg. While I have already hiked part of this section, I missed the middle mileage due to food poisoning, so I am looking forward to seeing Dismal Falls. I remember the terrain for the first and last day and it will be fun to hike it again. This time out I am going to take my tent instead of the hammock, just to mix it up a bit. Also my low back has been acting up and I think sleeping flat might help it recover more quickly. Let’s see what happens……..","Florida

Cuppa Tea,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544583,"After an early start, we arrived at Pearisburg, Va after driving two hours. Bubba, our shuttle driver, met us as planned and we followed him to a parking area next to the trail. After shifting our gear from Sheepdog’s truck to Bubba’s van, we were on our way south to Bland to the start of this section. It was 9 am and already it is warming up quickly. There is a low layer of clouds hanging over Bland, with the mountain ridges sticking up above. I remember this from when I was here in June; it is very pretty. The sun will burn it off soon. On our way up the road, a car is stopped ahead of us and the driver is pointing out the window to the side of the hill. Bubba slows and we all look, and lo and behold, there is a bear peeking out of the brush. It looks so small and cute; it just draws you to wanting to pet it! It is an unanimous decision: bears should have been created to be incredibly ugly so humans are not drawn to want to pet them! We also comment that while we hope it crosses the highway safely, it also means it will put it on the same ridge we will be climbing. Sigh.
Bubba drops us off and wishes us safe journey and down the road we go. The first mile is on paved road, curving downhill and I remember it well. Soon it is time to turn off into the woods, and we take time to get our special buffs (presents from Sheepdog!!) wet in the creek. It is turning into a hot day. Thankfully it will be spent in the shade of the forest. I chowed down a Cliff bar (how can I possibly be hungry after only one mile) and we began to climb the ridge as the trail rose along the side. After 15 minutes, the sweat was pouring and we were stopping for frequent rest breaks to calm our breathing. Heat and humidity make this harder that it really is. Crumpet is having trouble breathing, my back is being cranky and I am way too hot. Sheepdog is acclimating well (did I mention she is the youngest and strongest; an incredible hiker?).
We finally reach the ridge top and sit down to rest and reassess. It has taken us far too long to go so few miles. Decisions have to be made. Crumpet is truly not feeling well and reluctantly makes the wise decision to turn around and hike the 2 miles back to our starting point. We call Bubba to see if he is available to pick her up and take her to Pearisburg to the truck so she can go to a hotel, urgent care or whatever she feels necessary. That is set up, and we sadly part ways. It feels uncomfortable to have her hiking by herself while not feeling well, but it is only 2 miles and downhill. We turn on our phones and make a plan to text every 20 minutes until she reaches the shuttle. Sheepdog and I continue on. I am able to pick up the pace a bit now that we are on the ridge and we move along well, but after 30 minutes of that, I begin to realize that I am fading quickly. My back jolts with every uneven step and I am rapidly running out of water. I know we still have to climb Brushy Mountain before we camp for the night and I question whether I can do it without dehydrating. There is an abysmal lack of water in Virginia due to the excessive heat over the last few weeks. We hear from Crumpet, she is safe and at the road waiting for Bubba. Sheepdog and I sit and rest while snacking. My calf twinges with a cramp. That is not a good sign. With a sigh, I own up to the truth and admit to Sheepdog that I need to bail out as well. There is just no gain for this ‘mature’ body in pushing through this heat. We check the map and see that there is a road crossing where I could be picked up. Again, a call is made to Bubba and a pick up arranged. I still have to hike 3 more miles but it will be mostly downhill. Off we set and the pace gets slower as the day’s heat keeps increasing. My watch shows it to be about 93 degrees. A slight breeze picks up and helps me to feel more comfortable. Having been here before, I put my head down and just hike, hoping to end the misery as quickly as possible. Sheepdog is encouraging and we finally get to the bottom to find Bubba waiting and Crumpet wilted in the back seat.
We make a plan: Crumpet and I will get the truck and head to the Plaza Motel in Pearisburg for a night of air conditioning. Sheepdog will continue on in her quest to complete the Va section of the AT this year. We will meet her at Dismal Falls tomorrow at lunch time and provide trail magic for her in the form of icy cold Gatorade. Thankfully we can drive to Dismal Falls!!
Crumpet and I are devastated to be off the trail but try to pump ourselves up by acknowledging the wisdom of our decision.
Total miles hiked today: 9.9 (but they don't count in my total because I already counted them before)","Bland, VA
