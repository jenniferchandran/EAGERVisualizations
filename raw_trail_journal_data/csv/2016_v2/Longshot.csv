Longshot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512785,"My daughter and I are starting our preparations for a second thru hike attempt. We were all set to go the distance this year, however my body had other plans. We were on a shakedown hike in GA in early March a couple weeks ahead of our start date just to check the gear and conditions. Everything was going well until I hit some ice on Blood Mountain. Long story short the fall resulted in my leg being broke in two locations a torn ACL broken knee cap and ruptured meniscus. I may never know where I found the strength to get down that mountain and drive home to Indiana for surgery the next day. Thankfully in part due to a great surgeon my leg feels better than ever. Now we will do it right this time. Life only gives so many second chances and I don't plan to waste this wonderful opportunity I have been given.",,Second Chances,"Sep 08, Tue",0
Longshot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512787,"We should probably put a little of our background on here , so people can understand what makes us run. I have been blessed with a wonderful husband of 20 years that supports and understands the wanderlust that consumes us. I will be hiking the entire trail with my 20 year old Daughter Hailey. We will be joined in VA by her 18 year old sister Hillary aka Bojangles and my 15 year old Autistic son Holden aka Gift Shop. I raised them on the road in the woods and everywhere in-between. We learned early on my son does better in the wilderness than anywhere else. He has extreme lack of impulse control hence the trail name Gift Shop, so the woods offer little in the way of wants, thus the wonderful world of Autism is calm. I think this nontraditional upbringing has contributed to the children's future successes Hailey will be majoring in Biology after the trail in hopes of working for the NPS. Hillary is going to Med school to become a facial reconstruction surgeon . My oldest son will be attending school in the fall for computer engineering. Just as we must hike our own hike we live our own unique life.",,The wonderful world of Autism,"Sep 08, Tue",0
Longshot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512788,"The first question everyone asks when you explain you want to go on a little two thousand mile walk, with the clothes on your back and the shoes on your feet is always "" are you out of your mind""? The answer is yes and no I think you do have to be a bit different to feel the pull away from security and comfort, to pain deprivation and uncertainty. However, I think this makes so much more sense than things so called sane people do on a daily basis. I also get asked is this because of a book or a movie. No, this has always been in me something dangling just out of reach. I did my job, I raised children took care of a dying parent gave until I was left empty. This is my chance to repair , recover and get ready for the obstacles life will certainly put in my path in the future. This should be enough on the background now we will move on to every hikers favorite subject the gear.",,Are you out of your Mind?,"Sep 08, Tue",0
Longshot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512789,"Every hiker is painfully aware of three letters, REI. To say they saw me coming was an understatement. I have started to think of REI the same way I think of Disney World, some sort of unwritten obligation that you fulfill in order to conform to the expectations of being a responsible member of society. I now own a myriad of camping equipment both good and bad, because I don't want to appear to be an idiot, yet end up looking that way anyhow. I have learned to just nod my head when debating the merits of knocking a fourth of an ounce off my pack weight for just a mere $299 dollars more. Really, I want to be dry, warm in winter, cool in summer and boil some water. I look like I am ready to ascend K2. All kidding aside Here is the list of gear , I have found most useful from REI, and plan to use on my thru hike.

People say oh it must be nice to just be able to wander off for 5 months. They don't see that just like any other endeavor in our lives it requires sacrifice. I am so grateful to my husband whom will keep the home-fires burning. He truly understands the wanderlust that consumes me. So I must leave, I have to go!",,Money Money Money,"Sep 12, Sat",0
