Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525834,"What a gorgeous morning! Had only 2 hours of wind and rain early today. Now cloudy and cool. A true blessing given the monsoon that was forecast to hit us these first two days. It's 10 am and we are 2 miles into our 12.8 for the day. 
Experienced our first trail magic today. A couple from Quebec who are driving Skyline Dr on their way back home from Florida gave us bottled water. With much gratitude we filled all our nearly empty water bottles and bladders. It turned out to be more of a godsend than we realized in the moment, as we crossed no more springs or streams for the rest of the day. We would have been in real trouble if not for our French Canadian trail Angels. 
Another big day tomorrow. We'll be hiking 13.6 miles to Pinfield Hut.","Calf Mountain shelter Shenandoah NP VA

A microburst of wind in th middle of the night destroyed 3 of the 4 tents at our campsite. We then got a dusting of snow. Someone with a thermometer said it got down to 23.8 degrees.

Yogied a Gatorade and some granola bars from a nice girl at a Skyline Dr parking lot/ trail head. Met an elderly gentleman at the same lot as he started his afternoon stroll. Said he had two artificial hips. We bade him goodbye and shouldered our packs for the 3-mile uphill to the shelter. As we are cooking dinner who should show up but the same elderly gent we'd left behind down at the gap. We invited him to have a seat at which point he regaled us with tails of hiking the AT in the 60's carrying fifty pound+ packs and living on hoop cheese and crackers. He only had an hour to spend before racing the sunset back down the 
mountain but our time with him was special. Panda and I agreed that he should henceforth be known as ""The Sage of the Shenandoah"".

They've also been out for five days. Upon hearing tonight's weather forecast for more high winds, t-storms and snow showers they invited us to join them in the cabin they'd rented at Lewis Mountain Campground. More trail magic!

Sure was nice to be able to dress for the conditions while still inside. Breakfast was a couple of microwave biscuits washed down with a cup of joe. Today's hike was a tough one for a couple of old guys. Late lunch at Big Meadows was certainly a treat, but it ate up valuable time that could have been better used putting miles behind us on the trail. Pulled into camp at half past 7 and watched the sun go down over the Shenandoah Valley. Of note: first shelter we've stayed at with a bear vault in addition to a bear pole.

I'll be glad to get the reactor bag liner and overmitts my supply officer and sweetheart is sending. These low-mid 20 temps are pushing my 25 degree bag's limits, and my fingers are constantly numb while hiking in nothing but lightweight glove liners. Hiked across the top of some incredibly scenic cliffs today. Decided we needed a bit of a nero and so caught a ride into town from milepost 39 of Skyline Drive. Staying at the Open Arms Hostel in Luray. I highly recommend it. Alison, the proprietor, goes out of her way to make her guests feel at home. Got my ""care package"" from home this afternoon. Bag liner to keep me comfy well into the low teens, overmitts to keep my fingers happy, yak trax to keep me from slipping in the spring snowstorm that's forecast for this weekend, and some special surprises including my favorite chocolate no-bake preacher cookies.

Hopefully the time off will get him back up to full speed. The weather continues to confound. Sun tried to make an appearance at mid-day and things warmed significantly. Then the temps dropped and the rain began. It showered and sleeted off and on during our hike in from the road and snow showers are in the forecast for tonight. Made the shelter at 4 this afternoon. This may be the nicest shelter we've stayed in as far as how convenient the spring and privy are to the shelter. A unique feature of this shelter are the ""kissing trees"" right in front. I took a photo for TJ. The weather is pretty bad and it's a Thursday so I don't expect anyone else to join us this evening.

This was the second half marathon day of the eight days we've been on the trail. Ran into Slipknot again. He caught up with us about 10 am after having had breakfast in town and catching a lift to the trailhead. After nearly 900 trail miles he can really move fast. Turns out he's camping at the same shelter we are headed to. Of course, he'll get there about 2 in the afternoon, while it will take us all day. CP's ankle got so bad today that he resorted to hiking in teva sandals for a mile or so. He hiked in them to our lunch stop at Elk Wallow Wayside on Skyline Dr. I suggested he lace up the one boot like a shoe in order to take the pressure off the ankle bone. This did the trick. He was able to make the remaining 6.5 miles relatively pain-free while wearing boots instead of sandals. Good thing 'cause I'm not so sure he would have made it in those Tevas. Pulled into Gravel Springs a little after 6. A group of hikers was already there and had set up tarps across the open front of the shelter. Should help keep things a bit warmer than might otherwise have been the case. It's gonna be another cold one. The forecast is for low 20's and snow showers.

Hiked by some great views after a snowy climb to the ridge. It never warmed up much and it flurried off and on all day. Tonight's supposed to be our coldest yet, 17 degrees with 20 MPH winds. Tough hike today even though it was only ten and a half miles. When the trail left the national park it descended steeply through a rock jumble. I guess we must be getting close to the 100 mile mark.

Started out a bit overcast and cool but the sun came out around 11 and the rest of the day was glorious. As we lost elevation the wildflowers became more and more prevalent. It was the first day for trilliums, spring beauty, and trout lily. Bloodroot is up and close to blooming as well. Staying tonight in the Rod Hollow shelter after another 1/2 marathon day. There are three guys here (Sporky, Ninja and Bear Bait) who started at Springer Mountain in February. They've averaged 20-25 miles per day and now have over 1000 miles behind them.

Lots of water along the way tho so at least we didn't have to carry more than about a liter at any given time. Several ""firsts"" today... first turkey gobbles heard, first columbine seen, first jack-in the pulpit, and first Solomon seal. 
Staying at Bear's Den Hostel tonight. It's a beautiful lodge and conference center that was once the summer home of a wealthy immigrant family. It's made of granite block, and is very reminiscent of the castles of Scotland. It was abandoned and almost fell into ruin before being purchased and restored by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club. $26 gets you a bunk, a shower, a pizza, a soda and a laundry. Not too bad after a few days on the trail. Feeling a bit guilty about not being out on the trail, but not too guilty.

All-in-all not as bad a section of trail as it's made out to be, although I wouldn't have wanted to tackle it when we first started. Having a hundred miles or so under our belts certainly got us ready for the challenge. We made it to West Virginia today and will pass the 150 mile mark tomorrow. We will do a little over 12 miles for the day on our way into historic Harper's Ferry. By the way, Captain Panda has turned the science of yogiing free food into an art form.

The trail was mostly pretty rocky, without many stretches where it was possible to open it up and get full strides in. As we dropped off the ridge we passed Stonewall Jackson's artillery positions overlooking Harper's Ferry. The hand-dug trenches are still evident along the trail.

The ATC is actively encouraging thru-hikers to walk the trail as we are doing it- in a flip flop manner. Rather than starting in Georgia and hiking north, we have started near the half-way point, will hike to the northern terminus in Maine, then return to out starting point to hike south, completing our journey at the traditional starting point, Springer Mountain, Georgia. This helps take some pressure off the trail down south, where as many as 100 hikers start their northbound journey every day.

The route followed the historic C&O Canal towpath for three miles before climbing to Weaverton Cliffs, a rocky precipice overlooking the Potomac. We dined on peanut butter tortillas while soaking in the view. Made Garvey shelter a little after 2:00, descended 1/2 mile and about 500' to the spring and filled every water container I had. I loaded the 5 liters into my pack and headed back to the shelter. Took me almost 20 minutes. CP was waiting there by the time I got back. There was a good crowd at Garvey, and although it's an awesome shelter, Panda and I decided to head 4 more miles up the trail to the Crampton Gap Shelter. On our way we walked through one of the key gaps fought for during The Battle of South Mountain. This battle was a prelude to Antietam, the bloodiest battle in US history where over 20,000 Americans were killed, wounded or MIA. Sleeping under my hammock fly tonight.

It was a breeze compared to those early 13-mile days in Shenandoah. Our route traversed the many gaps fought over by the North and South during the Battle of South Mountain in September, 1862. Monuments to the fallen and historical markers tracing the order of battle were everywhere. Walking across this hallowed ground where so many perished was quite sobering. I can't imagine the pain and suffering even the survivors of that bloody time must have lived with on a daily basis. It makes me feel even more blessed for the freedom to hike these hills, unencumbered by the constant worry and fear of the warrior. Upon arriving at Dahlgren, discovered that one of the oldest continuously operating public houses in the country was only 1/4 mile up the trail. Built in the 1730's, it has survived the French and Indian War, the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Civil War. It has hosted a number of presidents and other noteworthy historical figures including George Washington. It is currently run by a master chef and his wife and offers dining of the finest caliber.

Although our destination, Annapolis Rocks, is a beautiful spot, there was not much to write home about during today's journey. I therefore submit this quote. ""I have met with but one or two persons in the course of my life who understood the art of Walking, that is, of taking walks- who had a genius, so to speak, for sauntering, which word is remarkably derived, from the idle people who roamed around the country in the Middle Ages, and asked charity, under pretense of going ""a la Sainte Terre"" to the Holy Land, until the children exclaimed, ""There goes a Sainte Terrer- a Saunterer, a Holy-Lander."" They who never go to the Holy Land in their walks, as they pretend, are indeed mere idlers and vagabonds; but they who do go are Saunterers in the good sense, such as I mean.""- Thoreau","Dahlgren Backpacker Campsite

The Annapolis Rocks campsite last night was gorgeous. Watched the sunset from the cliffs. Hoped to see the space station fly over but missed it somehow. I amused myself as I hiked today by considering the many metaphorical comparisons between long distance backpacking and ones's journey through life. More on that tomorrow perhaps. With regard to yesterday's journal entry, I like to think I'm on a bit of a pilgrimage, and so, perhaps I qualify as a Saunterer by Thoreau's definition.

It is quite a complex, and features tennis, swimming pools, jacuzzis, restaurants, bars, a variety of lodging options, and live dinner theater.

On the one hand I'm excited to return to the woods, on the other, I'm saddened at the prospect of not seeing my family for the next two and one half months. This will most likely be the longest stretch of time without a ""family fix"". I tried to make the best of my time at home. My girls were away for seven days so I spent a lot of time with my REI family. It was great to be with them again- lots of hugs, handshakes and back slapping, plus I was able to help out during the super-busy first days of the Anniversary Sale. I jokingly mentioned one day that my tired feet could use a pedicure and the next thing I knew I was getting a call from the local nail salon. Seems the REI folks took me at my word and pulled together to buy me that pedicure. I gotta tell ya, that was AWESOME!I also spent some quality time with my daughter Brittany and her best friend Tim. They had me over for a delicious salmon dinner and I reciprocated with grilled chicken and steamed veggies. My wonderful mother came to visit while I was home as well. She worked hard to help me find the 7lbs. I lost hiking the first section of trail. She also helped tremendously around the house and arranged to have my deck pressure washed and re-stained. What a woman. Last but not least I reconnected with my soul-mate and our two youngest daughters. There were birthdays to celebrate, Tee-ball games to attend, movies to see, gymnastic classes to sign up for, hot-air balloons to chase, and backyard swimming pools to purchase and play in. But mostly there were Daddy's Famous Pancakes to be eaten. It was wonderful beyond words to once again be with with my bride. We've been together almost 40 years and I'm simply not complete when we're apart. She is my staunchest advocate and has selflessly supported my pursuit of this dream. Sonia, you are my heroine. I'm gonna try my hardest to make it home in time for our wedding anniversary. Tonight I'll once again be lulled to sleep by the wind in the treetops and the songs of the wood thrush.

Many beautiful fields, pastures and old barns. The Pennsylvania Dutch keep their barns in excellent repair and the land well manicured. 
The trail was pretty flat with the exception of one 500' ascent, and compared to what we've experienced previously, not terribly rocky. We knocked out the 9.5 miles with relative ease, but of course, we WERE slack packing, with only about 5-8lbs of food and gear. That certainly helped a great deal. 
The ovenbirds are still singing and have been joined by peewees and several species of vireo. The wild Lilly of the valley is now in full bloom. Wild azalea and pink lady slipper are winding down but mountain laurel is on the verge of blooming. Cultivated varieties of rhododendron are in their full splendor down in the valleys. All the trees are fully leafed out and the ferns are up. We are now hiking the green tunnel. There aren't a lot of views but at least the leafy tree canopy is keeping the temps comfortable. 
We are staying at the Rock and Sole Hostel with a couple of Australians tonight. Having trekked in New Zealand and Nepal, they are now tackling perhaps the most well-known footpath in the world. They've travelled to the other side of the globe to hike here. All we had to do was hop in the car and drive a few hours. We are blessed to have this resource virtually in our own backyard.

After a good night's sleep and some incredible home-cooked food at Rock and Sole (shuttle from the trailhead, dinner, lodging, shower, breakfast and a lift back to the trail for $35), we saddled up and hit the trail.        Will finish this entry later. Thunderstorms are coming in and I need to cook and eat before they hit.      
Well, it's 8:15 (hiker midnight) and the rain is just beginning. Its approach was heralded by the calls of spring peepers and gray tree frogs. I'll have to make a point of remembering what good weather forecasters they are. Curious that they're way up here on top of the ridge with us. The nearest water is WAY down the hill. Believe me I know, I had to drop about 200 vertical feet off the ridge to find the spring, and when I did it was just barely flowing. It took nearly 20 minutes to fill 3, 1 liter water containers. 
Saw more pink lady slippers today than any other section of trail so far. The forest floor flanking the trail is often carpeted with ferns. Most seem to be NY ferns but there are quite a few cinnamon ferns mixed in. Hearing lots of reports of timber rattlers and copperheads so keeping an eye peeled for them as well. I just hope they feel me coming and either rattle in plenty of time for me to avoid them or just get the heck out of the way. Other wildlife news of note... Saw a photo of what appeared to be an eastern cougar taken not 4 miles from where we are hiking. Did someone release their exotic pet or is the big cat making a comeback? Goodness knows there are plenty of deer for them to prey on. Makes me glad to be hiking with a partner. I wonder if cougars are afraid of Pandas.","Rock and Sole Hostel

It was wonderful to be hiking as the woods awoke and with the morning mist still in the air. When we reached our first overlook we discovered that we were above the clouds that were hanging low in the valleys around us. The weather was cool and the trail was good. Just a great morning to be in the woods.        After the first few miles we descended steeply into Port Clinton PA. Its origins are rooted in the commerce and trade afforded by the nearby Schuylkill River (which flows all the way to Philadelphia). It's called Port Clinton because it was a port for the barge traffic that plied the canals built here during the early 1800's.The decsent into and climb out of out of Port Clinton did not disappoint

Also has aquariums displaying different trout species and warm water tanks with bass and bluegill.

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536083,"After tenting near the Windsor Furnace shelter site we got another fairly early start today. It was pleasantly cool with a enough breeze to cut the humidity. The climb out of camp was a good one, about 700' of elevation gain in 3/4 mile. We topped out at a rocky overlook known as ""The Pulpit"". It seemed that the entirety of Pennsylvania lay at our feet. Not far from The Pulpit we stumbled across an astronomical observatory with four different telescope buildings. The night sky must be fairly dark in this area. The trail followed the ridge east from the observatory and our hike quickly became a game of hopping from one rock to the next. At least it was flat. I've found that rocky descents are the most dangerous and difficult. It's hard to arrest the momentum generated with each step down, and one generates a lot of ""G's"" with every foot placement. The trail turned north at the end of the ridge and ran along a fire road for close to 4 miles. This was a welcome surprise as it was a smooth tread way with few rocks, highly unusual for Pennsylvania. Sightings of note today included a wood frog, cookoos (heard), crested flycatchers, peewees, and American redstart. Also spotted an eastern garter snake. The mountain laurel is on the cusp of blooming and will be gorgeous over the next week or two. Staying at the Eckville Shelter tonight.

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536278,"6/2Up early again. I'm convinced that the first 4 hours of the day are the best ones for summer backpacking. The temps are cool and there's more likelihood of seeing wildlife. Plus, you can knock out 6-8 of your daily miles before lunch. Waiting for Panda to return from Rock and Sole so we can resume our hike. Today's 11.7 mile section of trail supposed to be pretty rocky. We'll be climbing about 1000 feet in the first mile or so. It looks pretty flat after that, so likely to have many boulder fields. Panda is slack packing it. I opted to carry all my gear. We hit the trail just after 7, not a terribly late start but we can do better. The 1000 foot climb out of the gap did not disappoint. At least the trail was well graded. We made the ridge in about 30 minutes. Once there we enjoyed several overlooks with nice views. Overall the trail was pretty flat today, and after the first 6 miles or so, relatively rock-free (for PA at least). There were some fairly long sections of rock-hopping to be done during those first six miles though. Here's a BIG TIP for anyone hiking this section of trail... Do yourself a favor and put some rubber tips on your trekking poles. It keeps the tips of the poles on the rocks where you plant them and makes traversing the rocks much much easier. Without the rubber tips the carbide tips tend to slip and skate off the rocky surfaces just when you need them most. And I hate to say it, stay away from the REI brand. My hiking partner put those on his REI poles and they lasted about 15 miles before the carbide began to poke though the rubber. They need to redesign their tips with some reinforcement to prevent that. I put Leki tips on mine and they're still going strong after 50 miles. Ended up doing 12.7 today instead of 11.7. Found a cool spot to camp a ways before the road crossing at Blue Mountain Summit. Backtracked to it after the shuttle driver picked up Panda to take him back to the hostel. All by myself tonight for the first time in 400 miles of AT hiking. We usually camp at shelter sites and there's almost always a crowd. Since Panda decided to hostel it another night and I'm nowhere near a shelter it's gonna be a quiet evening. Nice change of pace.

It's 9:15 and I'm hanging out 'til Panda returns from the Rock and Sole hostel at 10. Although today's hike will be short at only 8.7 miles, it promises to be challenging.

We survived hiking the Knife Edge in the rain (no views of course). It was SKETCHY! Every foot placement was a roll of the dice. Even with rubber tips, the trekking poles were prone to slipping, and a slip at the wrong time or in the wrong direction could have easily led to a leg fracture or worse. Crossing similar boulder fields during dry conditions yesterday was SO much easier. I'm thankful to have fallen only once.

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536679,"Today's highlights were both biological and historical/geological. First the biological... I've never seen anything like the gypsy moth outbreak here. There must be trillions of them. They are absolutely eating the forest. The trees are so full of them that their droppings sound like rain. Pieces of leaves they've cut from the trees litter the trail. They seem to be especially fond of oaks. They've killed so many trees already that it's often difficult to find a safe place to pitch a tent. Dead trees and their limbs overhang many campsites. I had to move my tent night before last after noticing a dead limb over my original spot. It's really sad. I wonder if they'll kill all the trees and turn these areas into bald mountains like we have in NC and TN. Now for the historical/geologic....Our route today took us through Lehigh Gap. We lost about 1000' of elevation on the way into the gap, crossed the Lehigh River, then gained it back on the other side. The difference was that the descent occurred over the course of over two and a half miles, but the ascent was only a mile long. This made for a very steep climb. To add to the challenge, the trail took us up the ""Dead Mountain""; so called because it was turned into a lifeless pile of rock by a zinc smelting operation that ran in the Lehigh Valley for 100 years. The zinc smoke killed every living thing on the mountain. Without the trees, shrubs and grasses there was nothing to keep the soil from washing away. All that's left now is bedrock. The climb out of the gap was a hand over foot scramble up that rock and it was tough. One spot in particular verged on the need to rope up. It was probably a 5.1 move but with a 30 pound pack and wearing hiking boots it went at more like a 5.5. There was a good jug to grab at first, but then the handholds became slopers and the ledge our feet were on began to peter out. Got to the point where it was make the move or plummet 30'. Other sections of the trail have rebar rungs in spots like that. They could use some here for sure. Panda got his first deer tick bite and is developing the classic Lyme Disease ""bullseye"". He's taking meds. He also saw his first rattler. I've yet to see one. It's a bit unsettling because I'm sure I've walked past dozens but they're so well camouflaged I've not spotted them.","Ashfield Rd

As a precaution, we pitched our tents inside the shelter to protect us from wind blown rain that we thought might come our way during the severe storms forecast to arrive this afternoon.

After almost a mile of climbing we hung a right, turned off the road, and were in the woods again. The forest is so damp from last night's rain that we cruise silently down the trail. We slip along like ghosts as the woodland creatures go about their routines oblivious to our presence. We made the shelter at 12:30. Counting the extra mileage back to the trail that's 11 miles before lunch. We are going to push on after taking a long break and filling up on water (if we can find it). If we can do 14 or so today we can make up some time we lost while waiting out the rain yesterday. Panda slipped, got twisted in his trekking poles going down, and snapped one before hitting the ground with a thud. He's okay but the pole, not so much. Good thing we're only 2 days from an outfitter in Delaware Water Gap. He should have no trouble finding a replacement pole there.

By the time dawn broke our tents had dried, wahoo!We were up early again and on the trail by 6:15. By 7:30 we were starting a load of clothes at the Wind Gap Washerteria and Tanning Salon.

Oh well, it was nice while it lasted. Once we made the ridge top it was back to rock-hopping. The Pennsylvania section of the AT doesn't have many huge climbs and descents like other states, but it sure makes up for it with rocky trail. Especially over the northernmost 70 miles of Pennsylvania, it feels like you're hiking on a never-ending conveyor belt of rocks... big rocks, small rocks, fat rocks, skinny rocks. It's tiresome and dangerous. Several folks we've hiked with broke ankles and foot bones going through here and are off the trail for good. I had the pleasure of getting in an extra two miles on that rocky conveyor belt today while backtracking to find Panda. He missed a turn and ended up following the trail over Wolf Rocks instead of taking the by-pass trail as we had discussed. By the time I heard from him and returned to the spot from where I had begun my backtrack a nice thunderstorm was brewing. I pitched my tent in record time, threw in my gear, dived in after it and zipped the fly closed behind me just as the bottom dropped out. Panda made it safely to the shelter before the storm hit.

I know New Jersey will have its share of rocky trail too, but it cannot be as bad as PA. We climbed out of Delaware Water Gap on a well- graded trail and reached the ridge crest in about 45 minutes. We were greeted on top by Sunfish Pond, a glacial pond with crystal clear water. Highly unusual to come across a pond on the top of a mountain. I guess we'll see more and more of that as we head north into New England. After traversing the pond on very rocky scree we followed the ridge of Kitattiny Mountain with stunning views of the Delaware River Valley. The weather was glorious with plenty of sunshine along with white puffy cumulus clouds punctuating an otherwise azure blue sky. Curiously there are more bears along the trail in New Jersey than in any other state. It's easy to see why. The trail was flanked by acres of knee high blueberry (huckleberry) bushes. There were also thickets of mountain laurel that sometimes crowded the trail into a 3 foot wide corridor with no visibility around the next bend. I whistled my way along, hoping that by doing so I would avoid surprising old Smokey. It was kind of like whistling through a graveyard to keep the ghosts away. Although everyone I've passed on the trail has seen at least one and often several, I've yet to spot my first rattler.

I stopped for a Pepsi and a snicker bar when we crossed the road near Kittaninny Lake. Turns out it's only a few miles from where Ronnie Rost grew up.

We stopped in, used the facilities, partook in the trail magic and boogied on. Shortly after leaving the park headquarters we found ourselves climbing to the summit of High Point, the highest peak in NJ. There's a monument on top similar to the Washington Monument. It was built in 1929. Visitors can climb to the top free of charge, but they must negotiate the 291 steps to get there. The character of the trail changed dramatically after High Point.

I took a ""Navy Shower"" to conserve the water, and washed myself and the shorts I was wearing at the same time. I then filled a gallon- size zip lock bag with hot water, squirted in some detergent, and washed the rest of my clothes in the bag. It worked great. I used Joy dishwashing detergent for myself and my clothes. They dried hanging from the back of my pack as I walked the remaining two and a half miles to town. I made town about 5:00, and after setting up my tent in the Unionville NY town square, demolished a plate of Chicken Alfredo at the Italian restaurant across the street. I will sleep well tonight.

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538091,"Today was notable for the widest variety of hiking we've yet encountered. We slept in since we couldn't leave Unionville until we bounced our mail drop forward, and couldn't do that 'til the Post Office opened at 8:00. Well, sort of slept in... The civil defense sirens in town started wailing promptly at 0600, waking even the dead in the local cemetery. Most of us were up and packed by then so it really didn't matter. We missed the trail going out of town and walked about a half mile uphill (of course) on the road before discovering our mistake. We figured out a way to quasi-bushwack to the trail though, thus saving us the extra mileage and frustration of backtracking. Since we are now off Kittatinny Ridge the trail meandered through woods and across hayfields for the first couple of miles. Farmers were cutting and bailing hay as we passed, greeting us with a friendly wave as they maneuvered their tractors. The aroma of freshly cut hay mingled with the sweet perfume of wild rose, honeysuckle and privet, masking the not-so-sweet smell of sweaty hikers. No sooner had we become accustomed to the rolling farms and woodlands than the nature of the trail changed once more. We strode out of the woods and directly into the waterfowl impoundments of the Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge. This is one of only two wildlife refuges along the entire AT. It's an important stop-over/ resting spot for ducks and geese migrating up and down the Atlantic Flyway. After hiking a very flat couple of miles through the refuge we turned into the forest and began the 800' ascent of Potchuck Mtn. It forced us to change quickly back to mountain climbing mode as we threaded our way through boulders reminiscent of Pennsylvania. We tumbled down the back side of Potchuck and were spit out onto a mile-long boardwalk that traversed a marsh and crossed Potchuck creek on a wooden suspension bridge. This is the only handicapped accessible portion of the entire AT. Then it was back into the woods where we spotted the first scarlet tanager I've seen in years. After hiking 10-15 minutes in the woods we popped out into active cow pastures. The thirty or forty cows we walked by didn't seem to know what to think of two smelly hikers. We finally arrived at the end of our hike for the day and caught a ride into town. We camped behind the Vernon Episcopal Church, which runs a hiker hostel. They provide bunks, restrooms, a shower, kitchen, laundry facilities, outside tent space, and ask for only a $10 donation to cover expenses. Definitely one of the best stops on the trail so far.","Unionville NY

We took a taxi the 2.5 miles back to the trail rather than play ""Frogger"" on a busy, curvy, narrow road with no shoulders. Since it was a rest day we didn't actually start hiking until 2:30 in the afternoon. After shouldering our packs we entered the woods and were met with a section of trail known as ""The Stairway to Heaven"". It was named that for good reason. We climbed step after step up the steep incline for what seemed like forever and finally topped out at an overlook with beautiful views of the valley below. It was also possible to see the High Point Monument some twenty trail miles away, and beyond that, Delaware Water Gap and Pennsylvania. The weather today was warm, but still pleasant for hiking. We made the campsite a little after 5, cooked up some dinner, and went to bed. We are in for a long arduous day tomorrow, but tonight peewees, veerys and screech owls are lulling me to sleep.","Vernon NJ

Certainly among the day's highlights was seeing the New York City skyline from the trail, and traversing the highest elevation of the AT in New York. They were right up there with the hand-dipped homemade ice cream we had at a road crossing. We ate so much we had to waddle out of there. It's a good thing the campsite was only 2.5 miles up the trail!Today's terrain was pretty rugged. We actually had to do a lot of scrambling. Tomorrow promises more if the same, with more miles.

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538761,"Wayanawanda shelter site was beautiful. The shelter was fairly new. The bear box was large enough to place everyone's packs inside, and the privy was well maintained. Wildcat was just the opposite. It was good to leave. Our day began with overcast skies and rain showers. We were on the trail by 6:30 and had hiked only 45 minutes when I heard a great crash in the woods. I looked up just in time to see the north end of a very much southbound bear. He was moving so fast that he was out of site in about three seconds. This did not hurt my feelings in the least. So I can finally check that one off my list. Still looking for my first rattler. Seems every thru-hiker has seen several. It worries me some because it no doubt means I've walked by them an not seen them. I mean then no harm. I just don't want to step on one. Had my first wild blueberries today. They're starting to ripen up along the ridge lines. Perhaps that's what the bear was feeding on when we startled him. I read a trail logbook entry from a young thru-hiker who started in Georgia and is putting down some big mileage days. It simply asked ""Why am I so tired?"" Well here's the reason, there was far more climbing a descending in today's hike than any other section of trail we've done, including the ""Roller Coaster"". Most of the climbs were short but steep, only a few involved ascending more than 200-300', but a large percentage involved tedious boulder scrambling. Rain showers throughout the afternoon wet those rocks down nicely too, making them a bit slippery. It was also a 14.5 miler. And many of the water sources had gone dry. Thank God for trail magic. Someone left a dozen one-gallon jugs of water at three different road crossings. Without that we'd have been in trouble. All-in-all it was just a super hard day, 4100' of climbing, 3845' of descending, 14.5 miles. On the bright side we did get to go through the classic ""Lemon Squeezer"", got our first view of the Hudson River, and Harriman State Park was beautiful. And although it had no spring, privy or bear box, Fingerboard Shelter was situated on a beautiful spot. We set up our tents in a grassy knoll behind the shelter and got a well-earned good night's sleep. Tomorrow it's on to The West Mountain shelter, from which it is said you can see the Hudson River and the Manhattan skyline.","Wildcat

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538865,"Although it is situated almost 1/2 mile from the AT on a side trail, the West Mountain Shelter site was everything we had been told it would be and more. From a vantage point well over a thousand feet above, it overlooked a huge bay-like section of the Hudson River. It also provided an unobstructed view of the NYC skyline more than 40 miles away! After preparing an awesome dinner of a large Slim Jim cut up and added to some cheesy instant potatoes, I watched the city lights come up as dusk fell. It's hard to stay awake much past sunset, but this view was worth it. A good night's rest and a package waiting for us 8 miles up the trail in Fort Montgomery NY had us rolling out early in the morning. Our hike took us over Bear Mountain then down its flank all the way to the Hudson. I quick-marched the extra mile and a half to the Fort Montgomery post office because they closed at noon. Part of the side trip took me through a highway bridge construction site and forced me to traverse a missing stretch of bridge on a scaffold about a hundred feet above the river below. That got my attention. Just as I entered the tiny burg of Fort Montgomery some trail magic struck with full force. A couple of guys stopped and insisted on giving me a ride to the post office, the deli, and back to the trailhead, (saving me a return trip over the scaffolding) Thanks Zoomie and Cookie Mon!I sorted food from the mail drop on a picnic table at Bear Mountain State Park, loaded it into my pack, topped off my water, and promptly walked straight to the Bear Mountain State Park Pool. It was free to thru-hikers, and being 2 in the afternoon and blazing hot, it was just too good to pass up. Well all good things must come to an end, even pool parties, so I once again shouldered my pack and headed north across the Hudson on the Bear Mountain Bridge.

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538946,"It being Fathers Day, perhaps it was appropriate that we stayed at a Catholic retreat center last night. I'm sure there were many ""Fathers"" on the grounds. The center makes its ball field available to thru-hikers free of charge. There's also a cold shower and a picnic pavilion with electrical power. It was nice, but I gotta say, the Episcopalians in Vernon have it beat by a mile. Today's hike took us up and down through the beech woods of the Hudson Highlands. There don't seem to be as many bears as there were south of the Hudson but there are plenty of chipmunks. I counted 57 of the little buggers in the first mile. They dash in and out of the rocks and hide under logs left and right of the trail, alerting the rest of the woodland creatures to our presence with a shrill alarm call. We pushed farther than usual today with thoughts of hot showers dancing in our heads. To get them we had to make Canopus Lake in Fahnestock State Park. The fact that there was a snack bar with cold drinks and ice cream may also have had something to do with the decision. We pushed up and down the hills for 16.5 miles and when we arrived were misinformed by park staff who told us there were only cold showers. This was a major disappointment (see Catholic Retreat Center re showers). We had no choice but to suck it up and enjoy our second refreshingly cold shower in as many days. There was ice cream tho, so we managed. After cleaning up and enjoying frozen confections we headed up the hill a half mile to the campground. And what should we find there? Hot showers! GRRRR! Well at least they didn't charge for a site since we are thru-hikers. Just after setting up our tents we were beset by more trail magic. Seems a local gentleman camps in the campground and cooks for hikers. We all drank ice cold beverages and feasted on freshly cooked egg, ham and cheese sandwiches before turning in for the night. Nothing like a full belly after 17 miles of hiking to help one sleep well.Tomorrow we'll put in another 15 miles or so to the Morgan Stewart Shelter site.

We packed our gear, shouldered our loads, and walked. We follow the white blaze not knowing what new experiences lay ahead. It was another beautiful day to be in the woods. The sky was blue, the summer sun was warm, and the fresh green leaves on the trees whispered to us as cool breezes blew through the treetops. A secluded mountain lake awaited at the half-way point, beckoning us to cool our sweaty, dusty selves in its crystal clear waters. I happily obliged and spent nearly an hour counting bluegill and bass while sitting half-submerged. It was hard to leave but Katahdin was calling and I soon found myself once again marching on. Our journey soon led us by the largest oak on the entire AT, a 300 year-old monster of a tree, 28 feet in girth. It was growing where the trail crossed a country lane. I sat in the shade of its branches, contemplating the history it has witnessed. It was standing in these woods long before there was a United States, when Mohawk Indians hunted game here. It has somehow survived from that time to today, managing to avoid the frontiersman's axe and bolts out of the blue to remind us of how relatively insignificant a human lifespan truly is.","Morgan Stewart Shelter site

It was a short day at only 11 miles, and the trail was smoother overall than any section we've done. Sure, there were a couple of 500' climbs but the tread way was for the most part smooth and rock free. The most amazing thing about Connecticut so far though has been the trail magic we've experienced. We crossed two roads today and both had trail magic- ice chests with cold sodas, apples and bananas. And cases of snacks like potato chips, and Little Debbie's, and water, gallons and gallons of cool fresh water. All set out just inside the woods to help us thru-hikers along our way and to lift our spirits a bit. It feels as if the wonderful folks who put out these amazing caches of water and food are cheering us on in a most tangible way. And it didn't stop there.

The trail paralleled the Housatonic River for quite a ways, giving us good views of class III and IV whitewater rapids. Before long I opted to take a side trail to see and cross a classic New England covered bridge built in the 1800's. It was well worth the effort. Leaving the bridge, the trail did what it eventually must always do... It headed up the mountain. After a steep climb it led us through the Schaghticoke Indian Reservation. While hiking alone in the early morning mist I heard what sounded like drumbeats at several points along that stretch. Perhaps they were the sounds of young Indians on vision quests, or perhaps the drumming of long-since departed Hurons, Mohawks and Mohicans still echoes through these dark forests.","Ten Mile campsite on the Housatonic

I was glad to have my wool arm warmers as I traversed the ridge tops while the sun slowly climbed in the east. Before long I found my rhythm and the miles began to melt away. Up one ridge and down another I went until I found myself once again on the banks of the Housatonic. The trail flattened out and followed the river for a few miles offering a welcome reprieve to the steep climbs and descents of the ridges. When the trail began to climb again I checked my map to see what lay ahead. I was surprised to see a warning about an upcoming stream crossing and an advisory to take a detour rather than try to cross it. When I learned the detour involved walking by a convenience store where I could charge my phone and grab a cold soda and a sandwich it made the decision easy- I of course took the detour. I waited out the hottest part of the day recharging my phone and myself, putting off the steep climb back to the trail as long as possible. My phone soon showed 100%, and after downing 2 gatorades and 2 ham and cheese sandwiches it was time to Get moving again. I hoisted my pack and eased up the road, stepping gingerly until my stiff joints loosened up. Before long I entered the green tunnel that is the trail and immediately noticed a 10 degree drop in the temperature. One foot in front of the other, step after step, up one mountain and down another until I eventually arrived at my planned campsite. Dusk was descending. I quickly set up my tent, inhaled some dinner, hung my food bag, and slid into my sleeping bag for a well-deserved rest. Just as I was drifting off to sleep I heard it. The sound of something very large and very heavy coming toward my tent. Step-step-step it came, closer and closer until... Nothing. No sound. No movement. I slowly unzipped the tent fly and shined my light into the gathering gloom. Nothing. I turned out the light and listened, my heart racing. Step-step-step through the dry crackling leaves it came again. I shifted on my sleeping pad and it froze. I lay quietly in my tent and in a few moments it was on the move again, the sounds of its heavy footsteps in the dry leaves seemed no more than 20-30' away. Then it stopped coming closer and began to circle my tent. If I made any sound at all it would stop, then resume again after a few moments. Pacing, pacing. Not coming closer, but neither moving away. Finally the sounds of the footsteps receded back into the woods and all was quiet. That was none other than ursus Americanus come a calling, an American black bear looking to scavenge a bit of hiker food for dinner. I was glad I'd hung my food well away from the tent.

As is often the case, leaving town meant climbing up and out of the valley. This climb was extra special though because it went from a low river valley to he top of Bear Mountain, the state's highest peak. It then dropped steeply down a treacherous rocky slope into Sage's Ravine. After running along a beautiful cascading stream for a mile or so it crossed the stream and entered the state of Massachusetts. 
Seemingly not wanting to be outdone by its neighbor to the south, Massachusetts threw two major climbs at us right away. After crossing Ice Gulch, a deep and shaded ravine which sometimes holds snow and ice well into the summer months, the trail went vertical. Up and up it went, along the shoulder of Mount Race, skirting the very edges of cliff tops yielding stunning views of the valley below. After quite an effort I found myself on Race's huckleberry covered summit with no more mountain to climb. Looming ahead was Mount Everett, the last mountain between me and my campsite. To get there though meant picking my way down the boulder-strewn north flank of Mt Race. Down I went for what seemed an eternity, my legs turning rubbery from the relentless descent. Finally reaching the bottom I started up what was billed as the steepest, most difficult climb of the day- Mount Everett. 
Everett did not go down without a fight. I climbed and climbed some more, face down, grinding it out, willing my trail- weary legs to keep moving, digging with my trekking poles for any extra push they might provide. Finally, sweat running into my eyes and dripping from my nose, I found myself at the top. I had somehow reached the final summit of the day. Looking around, I suddenly realized that rain clouds were rolling in. I threw on my rain gear and headed down just as clouds began to obscure the view and light rain began to fall. As I neared the bottom of the punishing downhill I met a wonderful couple who had been out for a day hike. As I shared the story of my journey they asked if I might care for some leftover pizza. Well that was akin to asking a freshly caught fish if he'd like to be thrown back into the lake!

As early spring arrived the woods turned dozens of shades of green and we began to hear turkeys gobbling, grouse drumming and the songs of the early avian migrants like ovenbirds, thrushes, peewee and whippoorwill, some of whom had flown all the way from South America. All were establishing territories and finding mates. Love was in the air. Now the woods are full of youngsters. Turkey hens frantically try to keep tabs on as many as a dozen chicks. Momma bears closely guard their playful cubs. Spotted fawns of the whitetail lie still in the tall grass or chase about on wobbly legs. Thrushes lead me away from their nests. And chipmunks are everywhere, scurrying across logs and diving into their burrows at the first sign of danger. It is a time of plenty; plenty of fresh grasses, leaves and mushrooms for herbivores. And plenty of young and inexperienced herbivores for those at the top of the food chain. For some, life is short. For those who survive the cycle will continue. They'll be here next year to usher in a new spring with youngsters of their own. I march on, intrigued enthralled and amazed by it all.

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541422,"7/4 Noepel Shelter- Wilbur Clearing 7 miles 1626/2058'Today we climbed to the summit of Mt Graylock, the highest peak in Massachusetts. With an elevation of a little under 4000', it's a small mountain compared to Mount Mitchell, Clingman's Dome and many others in the southern Appalachians. That being said, it also presented the most continuous climb since Virginia. Due to its more northerly latitude, the climate and plant communities on top are like those found at much higher elevations down south. As we reached the main ridge leading to the summit we entered a boreal forest habitat more commonly found much farther north. The white and yellow birches gave way to red spruce and balsam fir. And I heard red squirrels for only the second time of the entire hike. They are well adapted to life in the boreal forest zone and make their displeasure with our intrusion well known with their loud and boisterous calls. These calls are why they're also called ""boomers"" in some areas. Being a fairly short day and with glorious weather, we had ample time and inclination to enjoy the full splendor of Mount Graylock's Summit. There's a lodge and restaurant on top that caters not just to hungry hikers but also the motorists and cyclists who drive and pedal to the top via paved roads. I hadn't planned to purchase anything more than an ice cold beverage but when I saw sloppy joes and angus burgers on the menu I just couldn't help myself. Before I knew what was happening I was half way through the most delicious burger I've had since Falls Village Connecticut. After lunch I went on a naturalist-led hike to learn more about the mountain and its history. Many of its buildings and trails were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression of the 1930's. A ski slope was also built, and many of the local boys who learned to ski on it found themselves in the famed 10th Mountain Division during WWII. Graylock was also climbed by Thoreau, an experience he wrote about extensively it so impressed him. It being July 4th, I've been invited into town to see the North Adams fireworks display. I was speaking last night with a Massachusetts Department of Parks and Conservation Department Ridge Runner who offered to pick me up from the trailhead 1/2 mile from tonight's campsite and take me to see them. More trail magic, although it does mean a solo 1/2 mile night-hike back to camp when he brings me back. I guess I'll be living up to my trail name tonight!","Noepel Shelter Site

By the time the ridge runner dropped me back off at the trailhead the witching hour was fast approaching. It was overcast. No moon, no stars, no ambient light whatsoever. After his tail lights disappeared around the bend it was like being in a cave. Until I turned on my headlight I literally could not see my hand in front of my face. There was nothing to be done but head into the woods and pray that my light would not malfunction on the way to camp a half mile away. I made it after a brisk 15 minute walk and dived into my tent, thankful to be ""home"". A brief rain shower heralded in a new day on the trail. We packed our now wet gear and headed for the summit of Mount Williams, traversing it before descending 2 miles into North Adams Massachusetts. Upon exiting the woods we came upon a small home-made sign welcoming us to town and describing a bike loaner program offered by none other than a town councilman. A quick left off the trail and a half-a-block stroll took us to his home where we found a bike rack with exactly 2 bikes sitting in it. The bikes were unlocked and available free of charge for exploring North Adams. I felt a bit like James Coburn in the movie The Great Escape as we pedaled off down the street.

Speaking of adventure, getting home certainly was one. It involved catching a BRTA bus to Pittsfield, an AMTRAK from Pittsfield to Boston, and a flight from Beantown to my home in Raleigh with a connection in Baltimore. I arrived in Pittsfield late in the morning for my 4:00 train. That gave me plenty of time to check out the town and stop by a bookstore before departing for Boston. As it turned out I had even more time than I anticipated since my train was 3 hours late. I was glad to have had the chance to pick up a book or two to pass the time. We pulled into Boston's South Street Station a little before midnight and the busses to the airport from there stopped running at 12:30. Feeling a bit like Cinderella with her magic pumpkin coach I caught a Silver Line bus just before they shut it down and arrived at a deserted Logan at half-past 12. 
All the ticket counters were closed so I pulled out my sleepin pad and bag and snoozed on the floor in front of the Southwest counter until they opened at 4.

It's amazing how quickly one looses fitness. Before leaving the trail we would often hike ten miles before lunch then loll along for the last 4 or 5 miles during the afternoon, and still get to camp by 4 or 5. Not anymore. It took all we had to make camp before sundown. Even though it's only late July, the faintest signs of fall are beginning to appear, especially in the higher elevations. The sun is already rising a bit later and setting earlier. Dawn no longer brings a cacophony of bird song. Fall wildflowers like goldenrod are starting to bloom. Spring wildflowers like trillium and Solomon Seal are turning yellow and setting seed. Gone is the perfect, fresh green foliage of spring. In its place are the worn, insect-eaten, leathery leaves of late summer. I must say it makes me a bit melancholy to think that another season is passing, and so quickly it seems. We did experience a first-of the-trip today. As we hiked along I began to notice fresh scratches etched in the rocks along the trail. While the carbide tipped trekking poles will leave scratch marks, these were different. Rather than a single scratch these were multiple, side-by-side marks. Then it dawned on me. These were crampon scars left behind from winter hiking trips when the temps are well below freezing and these trails are ice-covered. The crampons worn by stalwart winter hikers had cut through the thin ice and left tell-tale scars on the rocks below. Anyway, after a long hike we made camp in a hemlock stand on the banks of a small stream, cooked dinner, and immediately went to bed. Hopefully we will recover enough to hike another 14.5 miles tomorrow.","North Adams Mass

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543457,"Today the trail took us up and over Stratton Mountain, the location of a famous ski resort and the place credited with having given Benton Mackay the idea of creating what was to become the Appalachian Trail. There also happened to be a fire tower on top affording views as far as New York to the west, Connecticut to the south and New Hampshire to the north. Further, it was actually possible to catch a free ride on a ski gondola from the mountaintop into the town of Stratton (a full 2000' below the ridge) for lunch! This was an opportunity I simply could not pass up. But the real story of the day was one of trail magic. We hiked 3.6 miles to a road crossing trailhead and immediately were offered an ice cold frosty beverage, a chilled navel orange and a banana. We then found a ride to take Captain Panda to town for medical evaluation. After seeing Panda off I began the 3-mile climb to the top of Stratton. I topped out after an hour and a half of non-stop elevation gain (1700'), reached the fire tower and learned of the gondola. I sprinted the .8 miles to the lift shed, arriving just as huge drops of rain began to fall. I was on my personal, enclosed ski gondola within 45 seconds and quickly wisked down the mountain, out of the clouds and rain into a gorgeous New England summer afternoon. Views from the cable car were astounding. Stepping off the lift I walked directly to the Stratton Deli and ordered the largest sandwich on the menu. While eating said sandwich at an outside table I was approached by someone who wanted to know if I was a thru-hiker. I responded yes, at which point they handed me a 5-spot and told me to buy myself an ice cream with it. I was dumbfounded. I soon found myself back on the aerial tram, jetting to the summit. Reaching the top, I exited the car to the sounds of not-so-distant thunder. With almost 4 miles between me and my destination I shifted into high gear and headed down the trail as fast as an old man carrying a 40lb pack can hike. Long story short... It was a Saturday evening and I hoped to stay in one of Vermont's most popular trail shelters, and thunderstorms were coming on fast. It rained pretty hard on me the last 1/2 mile and it was so dark at only 6pm that I could barely see my way along the trail. I made the shelter just as the bottom fell out and lightning flashed all around. Sure enough, there must have bee 20 people there already. With a heavy heart I joined them in order to wait out the storm before setting up my tent. But hey, even that was truly a blessing. Then it happened. I discovered there was actually room in the shelter! Not only that, there was a group of weekenders having shrimp Alfredo and wine. Of course I was more than happy to assist them in disposing of the left-overs. After two glasses of wine I called it a day, turned in and slept like a baby while rain drummed on the shelter's tin roof. A magical end to a magical day!","Story Spring Shelter site

The terrain was gently undulating with an overall net elevation loss. Last night's storms had all the streams and springs running so finding water was no problem. In fact, the spring at the Spruce Mountain Shelter may have had the coldest, best-tasting water since Virginia. Speaking of the Spruce Mountain Shelter, it was quite the structure. It was fully enclosed, had a porch, a door, windows, and a wood stove inside! It could have easily been Thoreau's cabin. I made the trailhead by 1:30 and pulled out the lucky thumb, hoping for a ride to town. I had heard it was easy to catch one into Manchester from the spot where the AT crosses the road and I was about to find out for myself. It was a very busy road and several hundred cars went by. I was hoping for a ride in the back of a pickup truck because I smelled rather ripe from four hot, humid days of hiking. And it's always easier to tumble into the bed of a truck with your pack and trekking poles than try to fit them into a car. Trucks of all shapes,colors and sizes whizzed by without so much as a brake light coming on. After about 20 minutes of this I was beginning to have my doubts about my ""lucky thumb"". Just then a minivan slowed to look me over. I guess I didn't paper to be a serial killer or a hobo so they actually stopped and picked me up. I immediately apologized for my pungent aroma and thanked them profusely. Fifteen minutes later I was climbing out at the local grocery store and heading in to buy food for the next 3-day-long section of trail. Fortunately Panda had already arranged for us to stay at the Green Mountain Hostel, one of the nicest on the trail. I let them know I was ready and was picked up by the proprietor 15 minutes later.

The trail typically climbs when leaving a road. And generally the bigger the road the bigger the climb. Today was no exception. We began a 3-mile, 1000' climb as soon as we left the parking lot. Unlike many such climbs, this one led to the mountain summit of a ski resort. An hour and a half of uphill grind deposited us into a mountain clearing with warm sunshine, cooling breezes, and 360 degree views. Today also marked the completion of 800 trail miles. We are well over 1/3 of the way done, and now just 524 miles stand between us and Katahdin. After a second climb, this one a 900 footer over Styles Peak, we descended to Peru Shelter, which at 10 miles, was our intended destination. After a short rest and feeling surprisingly fresh, we decided to push on, at least as far as Griffith Pond anyway, which lay only another 1/2 mile up the trail. Took a dip in Griffith before heading in to lost pond. Didn't want to have to dry my shorts so went in without them. Of course, no sooner had I taken the plunge than I heard the sound of a woman's voice. I could've beaten Michael Phelps in a sprint to the rock where my shorts were waiting. No time to dry. I shimmied into those things as fast as I could, trying to keep them from getting too soaked. I made it just in time thank goodness, and the warm afternoon sun quickly dried what water did get on my shorts. The last 4 miles to Lost Pond were mostly flat, but did take us over the rocky ledges of Mount Baker, from which there were spectacular views. We arrived a little after 6 and made camp.

After a 200' climb we were atop the ridge and followed it all the way to VT Rt 4, some 3 miles distant. Our goal? Q's Whistle Stop, a converted train station that's now a restaurant. Along the way we were treated to views of the regional airport at the ""Airport Overlook"", and we crossed a suspension bridge right out of an Indiana Jones movie just before reaching the road. We hung a left and headed west for a half mile on Rt 4 to the gustatory Mecca that is Q's Whistle Stop. What to eat? The ""Hungry Hiker Breakfast"" of course! French Toast was the first course- 2 slices of half-inch-thick sourdough toast covered with real Vermont maple syrup. Next came the 2 eggs over easy with home fries, toast, and bacon. And since ""O-Town"" one of my hiking buddies is a vegetarian I scored his sausage! I washed it all down with 3 cups of Joe, an orange juice, and 4 glasses of water. Since my food bag was getting a bit light I splurged and ordered a club sandwich and a BLT to go. They each came with a bag of chips of course. I waddled out of the place on a super-full stomach and with a sandwich each for lunch and dinner. If you've been following my journey you know what happens whenever the Appalachian Trail leaves a major gap, or as they call them in New England ""notch""- the trail immediately climbs. Today was no exception. We went from 860' to 1500' in a half mile. Funny thing is, I felt like I was running on jet fuel! That breakfast, with all the carbs, protein and fat, together with the caffeine, powered me up that hill like nobody's business! I was at the top before I knew it and still feeling strong. Good thing too, 'cause we still had 2, 500-foot climbs to go. As we ran the ridge line north we dropped into a saddle at the 4-mile mark where Clarendon Shelter was located. We took a quick break there and continued north. The trail soon began to follow the Cold River, crossing it a time or two as we made our way upstream through stands of hemlock trees. There was much evidence of previous flooding. Huge sections of hills overlooking the river have tumbled into the stream, carrying hemlock trees along the way. The trail first crossed the stream then climbing away from it, at several points traversing cliffs 200' above the water before dropping back down and crossing it again. Eventually we turned away from the torrent, crossing a minor ridge. There I stopped for lunch (that sandwich from Q's was calling). I hoovered the BLT while washing the socks I've been wearing all week. Quite a productive stop if I do say so myself. The sound of distant thunder signaled the end of my break. I ""saddled up"" and hit the trail, hoping to make the next shelter before the bottom fell out. I normally average about 2 miles per hour, but with the added incentive of thunderstorms bearing down, and still benefitting from the high quality food from Q's, I averaged almost 4MPH all the way to the shelter, pulling in just as the storm hit in earnest.","Minerva

At 4235', Killington is the second highest mountain in Vermont, and the largest ski area in the northeast. We were looking at a 2000' climb over the next three miles to get to the top. The first mile wound through the northern hardwood forests we've become so accustomed to in New England. Then we transitioned to spruce and fir as we climbed higher. We finally reached the top of Little Killington after an hour or so of continuous climbing, then ran the ridge line to Killington. We took a well deserved break at Cooper Lodge, the highest AT shelter in VT, before starting down the north side of the mountain. The descent was very similar to the climb, about 2000' of elevation loss over a distance of 3 miles. Upon reaching the bottom of Killington we still had several miles of trail between us and the road. Our plan was to get to the trailhead in time to catch a bus into town. We hoped to make it to Rutland VT before the Yellow Deli and Hostel closed at three. It was going to be tight, but if we didn't waist time it was possible.

The remainder of the morning was spent walking around the Dartmouth College campus, visiting their famous Outing Club, and strolling through downtown Hanover. It was 11 before we realized it, time for the local pizza restaurant to start serving. And this one was offering a free slice to all thru-hikers! Well we really couldn't pass that up now could we?Fueled up and ready to go, we grabbed our packs and followed the white AT blazes into the woods. As is always the case, the trail climbed. Up we went, 100', 200', 300', on and on until we reached the ridge after 800' of vertical. The effort more than burned off that slice of pizza. We ran the ridge quite a ways, with numerous small ups and downs, then descended before hitting our final climb up Moose Mountain to the shelter. It was a short day- 11 trail miles plus two or three miles in town. Here's an ironic twist... I met a thru-hiker today who saw a moose on Bear Mountain and a bear on Moose Mountain.

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544913,"8/5/16Moose Mountain to Smarts Mountain12.2 miles, 4462'/ 3325'The day dawned cool and clear, perfect for hiking. It was almost chilly when we shouldered our packs and headed down the trail. The woods are very quiet these days. I believe most, if not all of the neotropical birds who migrate here to nest have headed south. I'm certainly not hearing them call like I was a couple of weeks ago. Where once their continuous cacophony of song was almost too much of a good thing, now there is none. Gone are he ovenbirds, vireos, warblers and veerys. Now there's only silence punctuated by the occasional song of the wood thrush or peewee. Water was an issue today. Unlike a few days ago when there was too much, this time there wasn't enough. This area is in the midst of a record drought. Even with the two and a half days of rain we had earlier this week there's not a lot of water in the streams. Almost all the seasonal springs are dry, and even some the reliable ones are barely flowing. I'll never take clean water for granted again. Being able to walk to the bathroom or kitchen and have instant access to hot and cold, fresh, clean water should be something we appreciate more than most of us do. This was also a day of challenging climbs. Probably the toughest since the roller coaster section in Virginia. There weren't as many 700-800'ers, just fewer, more continuous ascents of 1000- 1500'. We are coming into the infamous White Mountains of New Hampshire so this is to be expected. We started the day with the intention of hiking 17 miles. Had we been able to reach that goal we would have climbed over 5000' and descended an equal amount. This would have been over 1000' more than over the same distance in the 'coaster. As it was, we stalled out on a 2200' climb with just 12 miles behind us. We stumbled upon a beautiful tent site near the summit of Smarts Mountain, set up camp, cooked some dinner and collapsed into a semi-comatose sleep.","Moose Mountain

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544914,"Smarts Mountain- Ore Hill tent site. 13.1 miles, 2918'/ 4311' After a restful night listening to the wind whip through the fir trees surrounding our Smarts Mountain campsite, and the patter of rain on the tents as showers passed through, we awakened to dense fog. It made me thankful to have had the chance to enjoy the spectacular views from here when we arrived under clear skies yesterday. The body's capacity to recover never ceases to amaze me. Day after day we crawl exhausted into camp, and although we're a bit stiff the next morning, our bodies somehow manage to loosen up enough to do it all over again. Today we descended the north side of Smarts, then climbed up and over Mt Cube. Happily, the trail down Smarts was well graded and did not traverse the steep, slabby, slippery rock it did during yesterday's ascent. We made pretty good time and soon found ourselves at a beautiful, free-flowing brook. Having used the last of our water for dinner last night, we promptly filtered and drank two quarts on the spot. We filtered two more quarts for the road and we're off to tackle Mount Cube. The damp, cloudy weather broke by mid-morning and the trail was drying out some by the time we began our ascent. We were fortunate that it did since the south side of Cube was a repeat of the climb up Smarts. The mountain seemed determined not to let us access its summit, throwing down pitch after pitch of steep, bare, angled, slabs of rock for us to traverse. We carefully picked our way along and eventually broke out of the trees onto a series of open ledges with stupefying views. To the south we could trace the path we've hiked for the past three days. To the north we could see the mighty White Mountains looming, awaiting our arrival a few days hence. After summiting Mt Cube, and with showers in the forecast, we began our long descent of the mountain's northern flank. Much like Smarts, it was much less steep and rocky than the mountain's south side. Along the way we crossed paths with some southbound thrus who alerted us to trail magic ahead. It was getting late in the day so we could only hope we might be lucky enough to arrive before the magic disappeared. We again made good time and soon found ourselves approaching a dirt road. A sign tacked to a tree announced ""Trail Magic, 100 yards ahead"". Could it be? Had we made it in time? Upon crossing the road and entering the woods I began to hear voices. Rounding a bend in the trail I came upon a wonderful site... Trail magic! A local gentleman had set up a veritable restaurant in the woods and was serving scrambled eggs, orange juice, cookies, cornbread, snicker bars and bananas. He also had gallons of sweet fresh spring water, and folding chairs to sit in while we hoovered all the food we could hold. Thanks Carl! It was a good thing there was a campsite only a half mile up the trail. We waddled to it with full stomachs and smiling faces.","Smarts Mountain

8.4 mi. 3704'/ 3119'
Today was a day of firsts, our first 4000' peak and our first hiking above tree line. We climbed 3500' in the first 4 3/4 miles. We topped out on Mt Musilauke's south peak then traversed the summit's saddle to the higher north peak. Between the two peaks the trail was flanked by 5' high spruce hedges and was absolutely filled with moose droppings. Sadly, we learned that a very sick moose had been using that area for the past few weeks. It had contracted a disease from being infested with ticks and was so sick that it was starving itself to death. Rangers finally had to euthanize it. 
As is often the case above tree line, the wind was howling on top. After taking the requisite summit photos we quickly scurried down the north side of the mountain. 
We soon came upon signs warning of the dangerous trail ahead and discouraging its use during wet or icy conditions. Fortunately it was dry so we forged ahead. Before long the trail turned in an easterly direction and the bottom fell out. It began to parallel a cascading stream and used very small steps chiseled into the slabby rock to make traversing it even possible. The super steep pitches also had wooden blocks attached here and there to the smooth granite. This touch and go descending went on for over a mile while losing about 1200' of elevation. It was beautiful but very treacherous, and would have been impossible if it was the least bit wet. 
Eventually we hit more moderate terrain and before long we were standing at the trailhead. 
It was another great day of hiking, a preview of what lays ahead. 
Tomorrow we hike ""notch to notch"", 16.5 miles from Kinsman Notch to the Liberty Springs trailhead. Along the way we will climb up and over South and North Kinsman Peaks and skirt the shores of Lonesome Lake.","Jeffer's Brook Shelter

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545401,"Kinsman Notch- Liberty Springs Trailhead 16.4 miles, 5000'/ 5503'
Today was just another day in ""The Whites"". Beautiful scenery, rugged trails, and plenty of climbs and descents. It was, however a bit on the warm side with high humidity and temps in the low 90's, ridiculous for this area. 
The trail first took us over a series of short ups and downs to the summit of Wolf Mountain, some 4.5 miles distant and 1500' higher than our starting point. We then dropped 1100' over the next 3 miles to Eliza Brook. We fueled up at the Eliza Brook Shelter and re-hydrated before continuing on. 
It was a good thing we ate and drank when we did because the trail began another steep ascent, following the brook upstream for a ways and passing several waterfalls before diverging from the stream and climbing in earnest. After a mile and a half, and another 1000' of climbing we reached Harrington Pond. The pond shoreline was boggy and rimmed with sphagnum moss. Here and there grew clumps of carnivorous pitcher plants. Although we were too late to enjoy their flowers, the foot-tall flower heads that remained made it easy to find these fascinating plants. 
The scenery around Harrington Pond was stunning. Majestic granite cliffs covered with spruce rose to the north. It was with mixed feelings that we soon realized the trail was going to take us directly over them. Leaving the pond, we began climbing again. Within a quarter mile it became so steep and rocky that we had to stow our trekking poles and scramble hand over foot. This was the first of the two peaks of 4358' Mount Kinsman, and it was not going to let us stand on its summit without a fight. Higher and higher we climbed, carefully picking our way along the nearly vertical slope. After a mile, a gallon of sweat, and another 1000' of elevation gain we made the summit. There we were treated to a 360 degree view that included Mounts Cube and Musalauke to the south and the Franconia Ridge to our north. We could easily trace the route we've been hiking the past 3 days, and clearly see what lay ahead for the next two. 
The north face of Kinsman was almost as steep and technical as the south and it took a long time to pick out way down its craggy, rocky slope. One half mile and 500' below the summit we hit Kinsman Pond, then continued down another 1000'. 
Eventually we hit more moderate terrain and before long we were standing on the steps of the Lonesome Lake Hut, one of many such facilities run by the Appalachian Mountain Club here in the White Mountains. It would have been nice to have had time to check it out but night was falling and we needed to get to the road some 2 miles distant, so we pushed on. 
Fortunately the final stretch of trail was fairly flat and we made good time, exiting the woods and reaching the trailhead just as it became too dark to see. I checked my Fitbit and discovered I had burned 6000 calories over the course of the day's hike.","Kinsman Notch

Because we were holding at the hostel in anticipation of several days of dangerous weather, and yet wanting to get at least a few more miles done, we did it as a ""slack-pack"" carrying nothing but emergency supplies, food and water. Leaving our tents, sleeping bags, stoves, fuel, and multiple days worth if food behind made the hiking infinitely more enjoyable. 
Again we climbed, 4569' to the top of Mount Lafayette (5260'). Along the way we went over Mt Liberty (4458'), Little Haystack (4779'), and Mount Lincoln (5089'). The 3 miles from Haystack to the AMC Greenleaf hut (4204') was above tree line and afforded spectacular views. 
We started descending from the high ridges as the sky grew dark with gathering storm clouds. We hit Greenleaf Hut after a little over a mile and 1050' of downhill. Luckily the clouds lifted and the sun was back out by the time we arrived. Refilling our water bottles at the hut, we continued down to the road on the ""bridle trail"", which I thought would provide a more moderate grade. I was wrong.

Up we went, over 2000' in about 2 and a half miles. The top of the mountain was in the clouds but we summited anyway, celebrating with high fives as we reached the rock cairn marking the summit.

The forecast was for heavy rain and possibly thunderstorms during the afternoon, continuing overnight. It was raining pretty steadily when we hit the trail junction of the Mount Guyot trail at the 5 and a half mile mark. We had to choose between going on another 4.5 miles to Zealand Hut or bailing to Guyot. There was no guarantee of a spot at Zealand, and discretion being the better part of valor, we decided to take the bailout option. An 8/10 mile scramble down the hill delivered us to a nice dry shelter, a good place to wait out the storm. We'll push on towards Crawford Notch tomorrow.

A word about gear...
I found my pricey rain gear to be like wearing my own sauna when I hiked in it, so I sent it home. It was supposed to be highly breathable and well ventilated but I was getting as wet from the inside out as I would have from the rain. I decided in Hanover NH to go old school and purchased a pack board poncho. The back of the poncho is longer than the front so it fits over the pack too. The rain today tested it pretty well and so far I'm quite happy with it. Although it's 100% waterproof, there's so much ventilation that it feels cooler and I stayed a lot dryer.

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546104,"Today started differently... With a walk DOWNhill! We descended about 1500' into Crawford Notch where the trail crossed US 302 and the Saco River. I was getting a little low on food and needed to resupply so we relied on our thumbs instead of our feet to get us to town some 16 miles away. This area is extremely hiker-friendly and we secured a ride fairly quickly. A couple of sisters from New York picked us up and we were on our way- the wrong direction. They were very kind and tried to figure out a way to get us to Town without going too far off-route, but alas it was not possible. They dropped us off at the Willey House instead. The Willey House had a snack bar and was serving egg sandwiches and orange juice so we consoled ourselves with some comfort food while awaiting another ride. We didn't wait long. A server at the Mount Washington Hotel picked us up and took us all the way to town. We resupplied, promptly caught a ride back to the trail, and began our ascent of the notorious Webster Cliffs, a 2300' climb back to the top of the ridge. This section of trail is said to have the most exposure since Lehigh Gap PA and that was no idle boast. I stowed my trekking poles and scrambled hand over foot through many tough sections while a straight 1000' drop off to the Saco River competed for my attention. My first thought upon topping out and seeing the views into the notch was of Yosimite Valley. It was that beautiful. 
The trail continued along the top of Webster Cliffs for almost a mile, continuing its upward trajectory until reaching the summit of Mount Jackson, the first President north of the Notch. Then it was up and down through the boreal zone all the way to the tent site. Along the way, the huge cloud-topped massif of Mount Washington was visible through breaks in the spruce canopy. 
Eventually we made it to Nauman and got a spot on a tent platform for the night. The really cool thing about this tent site is its immediate proximity to the Mizpah Hut. As I may have mentioned previously, these huts are run by the Appalachian Mountain Club and have been a fixture in the White Mountains for the better part of 100 years. Each hut provides overnight accommodations for anywhere from 30 to over 100 guests. Dinner and breakfast are included in the cost of a night's stay, and the hut staff, or ""cru"" will pack a lunch for guests if requested. The huts are typically 6-8 miles apart, which makes it possible to hike the entire Franconia and Presidential Ranges while sleeping at the huts along the way. This eliminates the need to carry heavy gear like tents, stoves, sleeping bags and food, if you're able and willing to pay for your stay. A limited number of Thru-hikers are allowed to stay at the huts for free in exchange for helping the cru with their chores. This arrangement is called ""work for stay"" and usually involves the hiker pulling ""KP"" (washing dishes, clearing and cleaning tables, serving guests, etc.). Thru hikers also are also responsible for disposing of all left-over food, a task cheerfully accepted 100% of the time.

Thru- hikers are offered whatever food remains after the gentry (the paying guests) have eaten their fill. It's a win-win. Hungry hikers get some quality food and the hut cru doesn't have to carry it back down the mountain on their backs (there's no sanitation department to pick up the garbage up here. What can't be composted must be hauled for miles down the mountain on steep, rocky trails.) As you might imagine, thru-hikers circle the hut dining rooms like vultures. The trail took us over the Crown Jewels of the Presidential Range today, Mounts Jackson, Eisenhower, Jefferson, Adams, Pierce, Monroe, and the home of the world's worst weather, Mount Washington. We had stupefyingly perfect weather for it- clear skies and light (by Mt Washington standards) winds of only 20-25 MPH. We could easily see mountains we traversed 60 or 70 miles back, as well as the ones we will climb in Maine a few days from now. Why, we even ran into Hoss and Riggs on top. We first met them coming out of Massachusetts and hadn't seen them since Vermont. All this came at a price though. Darkness fell when we were still a mile from our tent site. We could have ""stealth camped"" but we were above tree line so we pushed on. The trail was rugged and rocky, making the hiking painfully slow an tedious. When we did finally get to the tent site it was full to overflowing. Someone there told us there was another site .7 miles further so we dragged ourselves onward. After creeping along for 45 minutes we finally made it to the next site. Alas, it also was full. We were told of a cabin .4 miles further so we pushed on again. By now it was 10:00 and I was going to live up to my trail name if we didn't find a campsite soon. The trail was so rugged and rocky that we couldn't even creep along at 1MPH.

We crossed the last of New Hampshire's 4000'ers as we summited the Carters and Mount Mariah. Of the 48 peaks in the state that reach more than 4000' in elevation we've climbed 24. The hike was technical for the first 5 miles and it was slow going. But the terrain moderated a bit once we hit the Rattle River. Once there the trail picked up what seemed to have been an old railroad grade and followed it almost 3 miles to the trailhead at NH 2. The walking was easy and there were only a few stretches of rocks to pick our way through. After two days of fighting our way up and down rocky, cliff-like trails it was a welcome reprieve to cover some mileage and be able to walk a mile or two with a normal stride. And as beautiful as they were, it was good to get the White Mountains behind us.","zeta pass

We enjoyed our stay with them and felt so welcomed and cared for that it felt as if we were leaving old friends behind. Four other thru-hikers left on the same shuttle but they were being dropped off at Crawford Notch, a spot we crossed last week. The most efficient way to shuttle us was to drop them off on the way to our trailhead. This meant driving all the way around the Presidential Range and by the Wildcats, a 40 mile circuit that provided us a with a windshield tour of the mountain ranges we've been hiking the past 10 days. The terrain today was much less rugged than what we've been hiking. It was very reminiscent of the Trail in NC. There was little to no rock scrambling, the pathway was mostly dirt, and wound through northern hardwood forests most of the day. We did our share of climbing, but it involved walking uphill not working our way up steep, slippery rock faces. The trail also passed a number of ponds that looked perfect for moose. And one made an appearance just yesterday at Gentian Pond where we are camped tonight, but alas still no moose. Perhaps we will spot one tomorrow once we are in Maine.","NH Route 2, Gorham NH

We climbed up, over, under and around car to house sized rocks the entire way. It took 2:20 to cover the 1 mile distance. As soon as the trail left the Notch it started up Mahoosic Arm, gaining 1500' in just over a mile. And it wasn't an easy 1500', there were many sloping slabs and steep rocky pitches to climb along the way. Then we descended to Speck Pond before starting another steep, exposed ascent up Old Speck Mountain.

The trailhead was at the scenic Height of Land overlook, a parking turn-out with spectacular views of Rangely Lake and the mountains surrounding it. Almost all of the lakes and ponds up here are natural rather than man-made. They sit in basins carved out by glaciers during the last ice age. And what happened to all of the rock that was scoured off to create these lakes? Why, it was deposited in Pennsylvania of course. And that's why the trail in PA is so ridiculously rocky. But back to today's hike. As it turned out, this was indeed an easy section of trail. All of the climbs and descents were short, most gaining or losing only a couple hundred feet. And the trail was actually a footpath rather than a vertical rock scramble. Of course there were still some steep rocky pitches to remind us that we're still in Maine. It skirted several lakes and ponds along the way, and the loons called to us as we passed. One of the more remote ponds even had a canoe. I couldn't resist taking her for a spin around the shoreline in hopes of jumping a bedding moose. All-in-all it was a nice reprieve from the extremes of the previous few days.

We were eating breakfast at a small diner in Rangely this morning when an older gentleman came in. He was obviously a hiker and we asked him to join us. Turns out he is a retired psychiatrist from Hillsborough NC, just 50 miles or so from my home. We had a fascinating conversation about mental health treatment, and no, he didn't suggest that I see him upon my return from the Trail. He's section hiking now and so had a car. After breakfast he drove us by out motel to get our gear, took us by the IGA, then all the way out to the trailhead. It was another example of trail magic. Our hike today took us up and over Saddleback Mountain, another 4000 footer. Being that high meant traveling above tree line again for about 3 miles. Usually that equates to amazing views but we were in the clouds today and could see no more than 100'. It was unfortunate. I'm told the mountains we could have seen to our north are in Canada. We got such a late start today that we decided to camp after only a little over 8 miles. The fact that there were over 60 thru-hikers headed to the next shelter beyond where we stopped also had a lot to do with our decision not to continue. Yes, we have been fully engulfed by the Thru-Hiker ""bubble"". It's quiet where we are tonight though. I'm falling asleep to the sounds of gentle rain on my tent fly and wind in the spruce trees.

September 11th dawned gloomy and grey with thunderstorms rolling through western Maine. It's almost as if these mountains are saddened and angered by what transpired on this date some 15 years ago. It would have been a great morning to have been able to roll over and go back to sleep, but duty calls. In spite of high wind warnings in the forecast and a trail made slick and treacherous by the rain, we set off to tackle the mighty Bigelows, the highest, most exposed mountains between Saddleback and Katahdin. 
Seeming to have pitty on our plight, and perhaps impressed by our determination to press on in spite of the conditions, the mountains smiled on us and the weather began to clear. By the time we reached Mt Bigelow's West Peak at 4145', puffy cumulus clouds were being driven across the summit by 60 to 70mph winds. It was difficult to stay upright while traversing the rocky, treeless summit. We stumbled upon the foundation walls of some long ago dismantled fire tower and hunkered down to regroup before venturing out to complete the next pitch. Leapfrogging along from one large boulder to the next we used the leeward side of each one as a mini refuge from the relentless hurricane force winds that scoured the summit. Eventually we made it to the relative safety of tree line and made our way across the rest of the summit ridge. We climbed up and over Avery Peak for a second helping of being blown about by the winds before finally descending below tree line for good. 
Picking our way along the boulder-strewn trail we eventually made it to Horn Pond, a glacial cirque, before finally beginning our 1500' descent to the road. We donned headlamps for the last mile and a half of the hike and hit ME Rt 27 a little after 7:30.

The run down from the summit of Little Bigelow was on a relatively gentle grade. We then we followed the shoreline of Flagstaff Lake for a mile or so before climbing up, over and down a 500' high speed bump over the last mile of our hike. The lake was gorgeous with crystal clear water and a boulder strewn shoreline. Its large- several miles long and as much as a half mile across. The wind kicked up some pretty good sized waves that rolled ashore sounding for all the world like the ocean. The night sky from there must be incredible.

Surprising, since it's a lot harder to climb out of that toasty warm sleeping bag when it's cold out. I'm sure the fact that Monson, good food, and a soft bed awaited us at the other end of nine miles had something to do with it. The trail followed the Piscataquis River for the first couple of miles. It's a rocky, clearwater stream that would make a good whitewater run with more water in it. This being the driest summer in 30 years here in Maine it was reduced to perhaps a tenth of its normal flow. In fact, hikers must ford it twice and during normal years this would mean wading waste deep. Trail maintainers have actually strung fording ropes across the river at these points to give hikers something to hold onto to keep from being swept away. The water is so low this year though that we were able to rock hop the crossings without so much as getting our feet wet. After following the river a bit the trail broke away from it and climbed about a thousand feet in two 500' steps. Nothing steep, but enough to get the blood flowing. It then descended to a fog-shrouded Lake Hebron. I knew I was getting close when I could hear loons calling. The lake was so beautiful I decided to take my first break there, after a little over 5 miles of hiking.

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549725,"Nahmakanta Lake-Rainbow Lake campsite 15.7miles. After a cool, windy 36 degree night we awakened to warm sunshine and calm winds. Someone spotted a pair of otters playing in the lake just beyond our campsite. I considered it to be a good omen. We quickly learned today that we're still in the mountains. One might have been led to believe otherwise from all the relatively flat terrain we covered yesterday. Today's hike took us from the lakeshore up and over the top of Nesuntabunt Mountain. Our 900' climb would have been rewarded with a great view of Katahdin had it been a clear day. Alas, the mountain was obscured by clouds. A cold north wind quickly chilled us in our sweat-soaked clothing and would have kept us from lingering even if there had been a view. Picking our way down a rooty, rock-strewn trail we descended quickly, soon gaining protection from the wind. Once off the mountain the trail flattened out with only gentle rises and descents. We hiked through alternating stretches of spruce/fir then birch/maple habitats while red squirrels protested our intrusion with loud, twittering calls of alarm. Soon we were following Rainbow Stream, climbing past waterfalls and cascades to its headwaters at Rainbow Lake. Another hiker just a half mile behind us crossed paths with a bear on this section of trail. Upon reaching the lake the trail followed its rocky shoreline for three miles before finally delivering us to our campsite. Perched on the top of an exposed point, the site was beautiful but did not afford much protection from the gale-force winds running down the lake. We made camp quickly and threw on all the layers we had just to stave off hypothermia. Dinner was prepared while hunkering down on the lee side of a large boulder. We hung our food, then it was into our tents and sleeping bags to keep warm. The sounds of the wind in the fir trees and waves crashing on the shore below our campsite soon serenaded us into a deep slumber. We are now less than 25 miles from Katahdin.","Nahmakanta Lake campsite

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549726,"Rainbow Lake campsite- Abol Bridge, 8.1 miles 1071'/ 1532'We originally planned to hike 17 miles to Katahdin Stream Campground in Baxter State Park today, then summit tomorrow. The weather has changed those plans. With a forecast of rain, high winds and a high temp of 38 for tomorrow we have decided to be flexible and bail at Abol. The trail warmed us up by taking us 500' to the top of Rainbow Ledges first thing in the morning. It was a bit of a climb, but after what we've been through for the last month we hardly noticed it. What we did notice however was a breathtaking view of Mount Katahdin from the top. After snapping a few photos we headed downhill. Six more miles of hiking delivered us to Abol Bridge over the Penobscot River. Moose season is upon us- the mating season for them and hunting season for Mainers. Bull moose are notoriously territorial and aggressive during the mating season. They've been known to attack full size pick-up trucks. The things weigh anywhere from 700-1000 lbs and are taller than a lot of horses. One reportedly ran through the campsite a couple of miles back down the trail from where we were staying last night, stomping and snorting. Luckily it didn't attack anyone or their tents! Abol Bridge Store serves as a big game check-in station. Hunters have to bring their moose there to have them weighed before driving home with them. By the time we arrived at 1:00 Saturday several moose had already been checked in and another was just being weighed. We are shuttling to the AT hostel in Millinocket and holing up there tonight and tomorrow to let the weather improve. We will return to Abol on Wednesday to hike the 10 miles to Katahdin Stream Campground. We will camp there Wednesday night and climb Katahdin Thursday. Fifteen miles to Katahdin's summit.","Rainbow Lake campsite

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549867,"Tuesday, September 27Zero day at the Appalachian Trail Lodge in Millinocket ME. The weather turned bad so instead of summiting today we took a zero in town. While there we attended to the myriad of logistical details one must take care of on ""days off"". We figured out how many meals we will need for the next section of trail, grocery shopped, repackaged and packed food, did laundry, cleaned up. And ate real food. After a few months on the trail one will never again take clean clothes, hot showers, real food, cotton sheets and a soft bed for granted.","Abol Bridge

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549868,"Wednesday September 28Abol Bridge Trailhead- Katahdin Stream Campsite, Baxter State Park10 miles, 1111'/ 580'This was possibly the most enjoyable, relaxing section of trail on the entire AT. After a short walk along Golden Road we hung a left and entered Baxter State Park. There to greet us were two whitetail does who seemed as curious about us as we were of them. They stood calmly observing us as we approached to within 20 feet. We spent a few minutes snapping photos then moved along. The trail was amazingly well groomed and flat, following the Penobscot River for about four miles. We rock hopped a few minor tributaries along the way, then came to Nesowadnehunk Stream. Here the trail turned north, away from the Penobscot and toward Katahdin. Following the Nesowadnehunk, we gradually ascended, hiking past waterfalls and cascades unlike anywhere else on the trail. Each was more impressive than the one before as we continued upstream. Eventually the trail diverged from the stream and meandered through quiet stretches of white pine and birch, delivering us to Katahdin Stream Campground about an hour before sunset. We ate dinner and made camp in lean-to #4, situated within yards of gurgling Katahdin Stream. Tomorrow's the big day- we climb 5267' Mount Katahdin, Maine's tallest mountain.","Millinocket ME

Midnight Strider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550019,"Katahdin Stream Campground- Kathdin summit via the Hunt Trail aka AT, descent via the Abol Trail 10.2 miles, 4233'/4233'We had a chilly night in the lean-to, making it tough to roll out of that nice warm sleeping bag. We got it done though. After packing our gear and eating a cold breakfast we headed to the ranger station. There we registered our hike and dumped any and all gear not necessary for the day's hike. Out came the sleeping bag and pad, the stove and fuel, the tent, and extra food. I guess my pack weighed about 15lbs after the purge. Satisfied we were carrying the lightest possible load, but that we still had what we would need for the day, we launched off onto the final, penultimate section of the entire AT- climbing Mount Katahdin. The thermometer on the trailhead kiosk read 32 degrees, and a sign admonishing us to turn back in time to get off the mountain before dark hinted at how serious an undertaking this hike was going to be. We cruised the the first mile or so, crossed a stream, then climbed toward tree-line. At 2.8 miles and after climbing to an elevation of 3300' we broke out of the trees and soaked in the incredible views. We could easily see the route the Trail has taken for the past few days. Whitecap, the Chairback Range, Moxie Bald, and far away on the southern horizon- the Bigelows. Turning our attention back to the task at hand we resumed our ascent, scrambling over large boulders that at times required the use of iron rungs and stirrups driven into the featureless granite. Another .8 mile and 600' of elevation gain delivered us to ""The Gateway"", where the grade suddenly flattened and the trail made its way across The Tablelands. Although flat compared to the steep, technical portions earlier in the day, the trail through The Tablelands nevertheless climbed yet another 765' over the remaining 1.4 miles to the summit. In an almost cruel twist, we could see the summit, and people on it, for the entirety of those 1.4 miles, making it seem to take a lot longer to get there than it should have. After another 45 minute stretch of hiking we finally made it to our goal- Baxter Peak on Mount Katahdin, the tallest mountain in Maine and the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. As with any mountain summit, climbing to the top is only half the job. You still have to get back down. We had two reasonable options for our descent, the AT or the Abol Trail. Neither would be easy, but we had heard that the Abol Trail wasn't so steep as to require iron rungs at least. That was enough to persuade O-Town and I to opt for it instead of the AT. We turned off the AT at Thoreau Spring and picked up the Abol, following it for perhaps 1/3 mile before arriving at a horizon line. Here the bottom dropped out as the trail followed the path of an old rock slide straight down the mountain. Picking our way from boulder to boulder, we lost over 1000' of elevation in about 1/2 mile. Mercifully, the trail diverged from the slide at this point. It has been re-routed away from the unstable boulders of the lower part of the rockslide and into an area vegetated with stunted, 2'-3' tall spruce trees. The descent was still steep, but we were no longer scrambling over boulders and there were actual switchbacks. The trees became less stunted as we made our way down toward the valley floor far below, soon reaching more normal heights of 20'-30'. Here and there birches began to appear as well, gradually becoming the dominant species as our descent continued. The trail finally leveled out as we returned to the valley, and in another half mile or so, delivered us to Abol Campground. From there we still had another 2 miles of hiking on the park's gravel roads to reach Katahdin Stream. In order to catch a free shuttle back to Millinocket we had to make it to Katahdin Stream by 4:30. It was already 4:15 so our chances looked pretty slim. We were fortunate enough to wave down some fishermen headed our way and piled into the back of their SUV for a ride to our destination. As it turned out, we just missed our shuttle but we were able to hitch a ride to town with someone who was picking up a thru-hiker.
