Bearfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527460,"Only 4 more days until we drive to Washington, DC to pick up Razor (Rhea Patrick). Joan will drive down with us and we'll all drive up to Harpers Ferry West Virginia for the 2nd Annual Flip Flop Festival. 
We'll all stay with Laurel at her hostel in Bolivar, The Teahorse Hostel. Great place with an amazing breakfast included of freshly made waffles and fruit toppings. I stayed there on my 2013 AT thru hike and loved it. We'll be there Friday and Saturday nights. 
Razor and I will leave Sunday, April 17th, to start our Sobo (southbound) hike to Springer Mountain in Amicalola Falls State Park, Georgia.","Cape May Court House, NJ

Bearfoot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527785,"One more day of waiting. Very little prep left to do. Will spray Permethrin on my hiking clothes tomorrow to repel all the little nasties. Finished vacuum sealing my homemade trailmix today as well as my favorite meal, Thanksgiving Mix. A combination of Idaho Dehydrated Potato, dry stuffing, bacon bits, some herbs. Oh yeah, haircut tomorrow!","Harpers Ferry, WV
