However, the sun was out brightly and the skies were blue so what more could I ask for? Yesterday I thought I missed the traditional halfway point marker for the AT. I found it and was surprised that it's just a 1/4 of a mile past the Quarry Gap shelter where I hunkered down for the night. the climb up out of Pine Grove Furnace SP was long and tiring or boring. Sparky & Mike from Canada go off to an early start they had a 21 mile day planed. Gilbert from Miami who hikes at my pace blew out his right knee on the decent into Pine Furace SP . This the same w park for the half gallon ice cream challenge. However, they were closed so no challenge. They open on Memorial Day.

I thought she was at least a day ahead of me but she met friends at pine grove and the. Got back on trail.

Made it to Boiling Springs and decided not to stay at the hikers campground due to the loud noise of the trains passing next to it. So I opted to stay at ""Allenberry Resort Inn & Playhouse"". They have a nice setup here and it's inexpensive for hikers. PS: the AWOL AT Guide say they have short term food supply but they don't they only sell novelty stuff i.e.. T-shirts Etc.

Stopped for 15 minute break at Pennsylvania Route 641 5 miles from starting point I met an Asian lady who was just out day hiking and talk to her for 5 minute about hiking just stopped here at the Appalachian trail kiosk right here on Pennsylvania Route 641. I went past a out door shooting range and the noise was intense and it was a parking lot was full of cars at 10 o'clock in the morning. Now that was a little scary becaus it sounded like the range was sitting on the trail. it's 11 o'clock right now and today is Friday April the 22nd. I crossed over I-76 met two local ladies out for a day hike with their Jack Russell dog and talked with them for 5 minutes. The birds are just chirping away I think they were singing "" you are my sunshine my beautiful sunshine you make me happy even in the rain so please don't take my sunshine away"" I was singing right along with them. And they got even louder and we had a good sing-along :-). The the chip monks chimed in and we sounded like a 3 piece ensemble. After the sing-along, I crossed the cow pastures and talked to them for a few minutes when most of them gathered by the fence. There was one cow (a big brown one) that just stared at me like I was crazy. The other ones seemed to like me talking to them so I made a video of them and posted on face book then I met Jim (a US Navy get from Korean War) minutes later who owned a farm. He was out for a day walk. Talked with a lady taking pictures of the various flowers along the trail. So I learned the names of several flowers that were along the trail (Jack-in-the alter, Virginia blue bells, purple violets & yellow violet ). Made it to the shelter and 5 others are here (Noggin who is thru hiking and started in GA in February, Catchup & Mustard two ladies out doing section hikes Southbound, Richard & Dave also section hikers going southbound). We sat around 
and ate and talked. Catchup & mustard got their trail names because one is wearing yellow crocks 
and the other one is wearing red crocks ( same colors the Steelers ' cardinals wore in their game with throwback uniforms. Well it's begins and a thunderstorm outside. Raining hard as hell and catchup & mustard are snoring loud as hell also. Hope I can get some sleep tonight.","Darlington Shelter

Trail Angle Mary gave me a ride and she is an awesome Taril Angle and just an all around super person. I Stopped at the post office and collected my boxes and packed a box to send home. The PO clerk said we close in 10 minutes I acknowledge her and she gave me the address labels and tape for the boxes. I finished labeling the address sticker and turned around and the door was locked with the close sign on it. It did not take me 10 minutes more like 5 minutes. The clerk never asked if I was ready or finished or to say she was locking up/closing. I knocked on the door and called out to anyone behind the wall but no response. I couldn't carry the two boxes to the next town stop 60 miles away. So, I called trail Angle Mary again and she saved the day. She picked me up from the post office and took me to her place. She helped me relabel one box and help tape it up and put label in water tight mail envelope. She will mail them out on Monday. Great lady. On the way out of Duncannon, i I stopped and had two slices of meat lovers pizza and two gator aid drinks their went three blocks and got a large cone of ice cream and ate it then I left Duncannon with a full pack load and stomach. I made it up the two climbs to the top. It was a knarly two climbs through rock & bolder fields up & downs. Made it to the Clarks Ferry Shelter and made dinner ( chilli with beans & rice, sweet potatoe & hot chocolate).

Got this morning at 5:30 had breakfast and loaded up on water for the day because water sources are far and few in between for today's hike. Met several families out for day hikes. I passed one husband and wife who were both packing heat open carry ( Glock 40 mm) talked with them a few minutes and kept moving. Stopped and had lunch at Table Rock view. Several people stopped by to enjoy the view. I met Jim was day hiking and talked with him while having my lunch. Then ""Noggin"" shoes up and we talked a few minutes. I told him I thought he'd be two days ahead of me at the pace and mileage he's doing everyday. He said he stopped in and stayed the night in Duncannon to rest his right leg. He thinks he ruptured a ligament or a bad case of shin splints. He plans to get off the trail at I-86 and hitch a ride to the next town and have his wife pick home up to have a doctor look at his leg. When I saw the leg it didn't look good. After he left, lady name Kate showed up with her dog a border collie. We talked for about 15 minutes about hiking the trail and it being one of the things on her bucket list. I left there and stopped at Peters Mountain Shelter and ran into ""Nuget"" who decided to stop for lunch. I stopped there and took a half hour nap. When I woke up ""Nuget"" was gone.

I stopped to take pictures at the power line break where there's a view of the valley below (m 1155.3). Stopped at Table Rock View for lunch and saw the valley below and the distant ridge lines and several perigean Hawks stalking prey from the air. I Stopped at Peters Mountain Shelter and ran into ""Nugget"" again he was taking a lunch break. I stopped to take a nap because too many people kept showing up at Table Rock View. I came off the mountain and crossed PA Rt 325 where I met ""Hoho"" and ""Chicory"". Both have done the AT twice and the PCT so they are professional hikers. I won't be trying to keep up with them lol. I stopped at Horse-Shoe Trail for a 15 minute break and sign the log book or trail register. I met ""Dirt"" five minutes later he was taking a break talking to a day hiker. I talked to them for about 5 minutes and moved on. Made it to Yellow Springs Village Site ( old coal mining settlement). I signed the register and took a picture. Stopped at Cold Spring Trail for a 15 minute break. Made it to Rausch Gap Shelter. I met ""Boston"" ( he just ran the last Boston Marathon) and also met ""Uber Scout"" and his newly wed wife ""Lost Giggling"" then there was Jackie & her mom Sharon the PT Therapist And her brother.

Talked with Boston for a minute and finished eating a said good by""s to Jackie, Sharon and her brother and headed out going north. Uber Scout and Lost Giggles were just starting to have breakfast and Boston had just left. The first four miles of trail was ok just a 1,300 foot climb to the ridge. Then all hell came with the rocks and more rocks of trail until I started my decent from the mountain. Once on the bottom and hiking across the semi open fied, I met ""Mushroom"" he to is a a jet Nam Vet who served in the US Navy on a battle ship providing Naval fire support. I the headed across the PA Rt 72 (just outside of Lickdale, PA) and made it to the under pass of I-81 which also a part of Swatara Gap and the Swatara State Game land park. I stopped and cooked my lunch in the shade and the breeze under the under pass. The breeze kept the gnats and flies away. There was two benches made from tree limbs there so I took a half hour nap there at the under pass. I slept good because the sound of the overhead traffic was like listening to ""Peter, Paul & Mary's song ""I'm leaving on a jet plane and don't know when I'll be back again"". It put me right to sleep and a damn good sleep. Just as I was heading out, Uber Scout and Lost Giggles came up the hill and we chatted a minutes and they also decided to take there lunch break there. I continued my climb up the mountain over the next 30 minutes until I reached the top at 1,679 feet. The the skies started rumbling and the rain came light to moderate rain fall. I donned my the Six Moon Gatewood Cape and kept on moving. Thanks to my sister the rain gear got to me on time back in Duncannon, PA back on Saturday. I continue on the rocky trail that with every step was like stepping on sharp rocks. Then to make matters worse, I had to navigate a bolder filed of holders and rocks for the next 1/4 of a mile and it was relentless on the feet. I passed a couple from Brookland, NY and we chatted a minute and I moved on ( can't remember their trail names). I made it to the William Penn Shelter and U ER Scout and Lost Giggles were already there and a section hiker who came southbound from New Hampshire and said today was his 100th day on the trail. And he talked non stop wowwwww. Ok it's time for me to hit the bed. I got a 17 mile hike tomorrow to the Eagles Nest shelter.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530216,"4/27/2016 planned a short day of hiking. My body is feeling tired and feet are aching from all the rocks one has to negotiate with every step on the stretch of trail from Duncannon to PA Rt 501. The rocks tend to zap your strength over the course of the day. The high temperatures over the past week also zapped your energy and called for a lot more fluid intake (electrolyte). Can't wait to get to Port Clinton for my mail drop. I think I'll send some items back home that I'm not using or don't have a pressing need for. I left William Penn Shelter and hiked to the PA Rt 501 road crossing leading to the 501 Shelter. The 501 Shelter is on private property and the owner serves hot pizza if you're staying the night. They also have an outdoor shower but it's cold water. However the walk to the shelter is 1.5 miles. I decided to call ahead to a new hostel I learned of from a section hiker name Dave Tosten of Shipenburg, PA. He stayed at the shelter with me, Uber Scout and Lost Giggles. The hostel owner Craig picked me up at the road crossing brought me here to his new hostel a converted garage. I've had many good conversation with Craig due to our commonality of being retired law enforcement. The accommodation are very good and hiker friendly both setup and the people (Craig, his wife Jody and 16 year old son Nate). Oh, I met the dog ""Sugar"" When I arrived, i got a hot shower and I crashed out until about 6:00 when I was served dinner (string beans, cheese potatoes casserole and BBQ sandwich on ciabatta bread) absolutely delicious :-). Shortly after dinner, Sheila, a section hiker from NC who has stayed here overnight, came in and we chatted awhile. She and I both are former Marines (SEMPER FI to that). After dinner, Craig's wife brought the two of us a serving of ice cream over a fudge with chocolate syrup. Absolutely delicious, it part of the birthday desert for their son who turned 16 today. Oh by the way, he's a damn good high school wrestler. After dinner Sheila & I chatted a few minutes before I called it a night.","Rock & Soul Hostel

Got up a bout 6:30 AM and to gloomy conditions outdoors. Jody & Creig brought our breakfast in at about 7:30 AM. Sheila and I had oatmeal pancakes and a fruit bowl w/tangerine wedges & strawberries and coffee. Afterwards Sheila packed up and drove to PA Rt 501 to finish doing a mile long hike of trail she didn't do yesterday (before the rain start). After that she was going to make the drive home to NC. Creig had a pick at noon and it was ""Mayhem"" who I met in Harper's Ferry during the Flip-Flop Festival. I last saw him several days back and he had been reading my log book entries and trying to catch up to me. Well, he caught up to me today while hunkered down due to the weather. He to was trying to get here at Rock & Soul Hostel before the bad weather (he made it in the nick of time). It's good seeing Mayhem and I told him it looks like he's lost some weight like myself. He said it feels like it too. I know I have a lost a few pounds early into the hike mainly due the heat the first week on the trail and the long days and miles. My young son called to check on me and how the hike was going. That was really thoughtful of him. We had a good conversation and I'm so really proud of home and his taking on the responsibilities while I'm gone. To my son "" your Padre is very proud of you and loves you to no end"" keep up the good work. He has been my motivation each time I start a ascent to the top of a mountain. I just think of what he told me when he dropped me off at the starting point. He said ""you got this Padre."" Yep, just those few words keep me motivated during a tuff ascent. I had dinner ( burger w/Swiss cheese, steamed broccoli, fried zucchini and mac & cheese & ice tea). I'm now planing out my day for tomorrow since today was a zero day for me due to the hyperthermia weather conditions. Mayhem told me the older couple (Jot & Huckleberry) from Brooklyn, NY were suppose to come here today as well. But, I guess they hiked on to the next shelter or hunkered down in their tent at a campsite somewhere. I know today wasn't a very good day to be trying to hike 17 miles in the cold rain to the Eagles Nest shelter. Besides, any firewood to be found to start a fire is soaked. And in this type weather, if you can't get a fire going it's going to be a long cold night. I hope to be in Port Clinton tomorrow to get my food mail drop. It's still raining more of a drizzle and the temp has dropped to 45* here in Schuylkill Haven, PA.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531764,"Update for my followers from last Saturday when I had difficulty with a tooth/gum issue. Hiked to the Windsor Furnace Shelter from Port Clinton and was having difficulty eating and swallowing food and water. Decided that the situation might get worse before getting better and I should seek professional medical service. I decided to hike back to Port Clinton. On the hike back, I called one of my scuba diving buddies from PA (Bob Wm's) and they (he and his wonderful wife Marie) picked me up in Port Clinton and transported me to home in Maryland. I went to Patient First Clinic on Sunday and got meds and diagnosis. Monday I saw my Primary Care Doctor, Wednesday saw my oral surgeon who diagnosed my condition (partial bone protrusion through the tissue at the site of a previous tooth extraction). The tooth extraction by a general dentist that went bad is a long story, so I'll skip that for now. Went back to Oral Surgeon on Thursday for an in-office minor surgery where the exposed bone was shaved down below gum line to prevent further impinging on the back end of the tongue. The procedure went well. I'm on pain meds for now and today there is far less pain than yesterday. Today (Friday) I saw my ENT Doctor who checked out my throat and esophagus and got a prescript for the ulcer on the tongue created by the exposed bone. I got a followup on Monday with oral surgeon to evaluate the healing process and learn when he'll release me to get back on the trail. Hope to be back on trail by next weekend. So, wish me luck.

Got to the shelter and I met ""stump"" who is a former Marine so we had a good conversation he's staying in his tent tonight he's out for the week he's going to Harpers Ferry also he has a t'train to catch on Friday like myself. I had a good dinner fettuccine noodles sweet potatoes hot chocolate and a snickers candy bar for dessert . Tomorrow I hit the roller coaster and I'll hike to Bears Den Hostal or the Rod Hollow shelter not sure which one I'm going to do yet . It all depends on how I do on the stretch of trail known as the Roller Coaster. It is a 13 mile stretch of trail that has approximately 13 mountains up and down up and down up and down that's why they call it the roller coaster I called it a bunch of PUDS ""pointless ups and downs"".

Spoke to the two ladies who tented there for the night, as I left the area. Did not see where ""Stump"" tented but his food bag was still hanging on the bear pole. Climbed over to mountains on my way to Dicks Dome Shelter. I decided not to walk the 0.4 mile down hill to the shelter. Instead, I took my break on a rock at the trail junction for the shelter. I met ""Sheppa"" a section hiker going south. He had some interesting hiking sticks made from Bambu and 550 para cord. We talked a few minutes an went on our way. Later I met ""Jeopardy"" he's THRU-hiking southbound said he started in Maine. We talked a few minutes and parted ways. I met Adele at the trail junction for the AT & Sky Meadows State Park, who's out for the day hiking. I had a great conversation with her and a selfi. Made it to the Rod Hollow Shelter where I met ""Wood"" & ""Mombo"" and ""Walnut"" ( who hiked into camp bare foot) who are thru hiking from GA. Miriam & her sister Nancy stopped by to say hi and to see all who made it to this shelter. ""OB another THRU hiker who's with Mombo & Wood showed up. And, three section hikers one with a dog also showed up at the shelter. Oh well, two more THRU hikers from GA hiked into camp. They did 32 miles today.

The rain started by the time I left camp and continued throughout most of the day. Most of the thru hikers left camp before 6AM. I stopped at Sam Moore Shelter and cooked lunch. I met ""Owl"" a section hiker from Tennessee. She's out hiking the VA section and will be heading to Harper's Ferry to get transport to go home. I caught up to one of them and he was out of gas as we hiked in the rain on the section of the AT known as the ""Roller Coaster"". There are 13 miles of ups and down hills averaging 600 + foot climbs. As soon as you get to the bottom of one mountain then you start going up the next mountain. That's the kind of day it was as it rained on you all day. Oh did I mention I fell twice in the process (lol). The first time I fell I had no clues as to why. I just remember saying to myself "" damn I'm falling"". Well I landed on my left side (more on my pack than my side) but no worries didn't get hurt more amazed and surprise than anything. The second fall was abut an hour later when my right foot kicked out from under me on a wet rock sending me stumbling forward until I made a crash landing in the mud. Made it to Bears Den Hostel for the night. I had a great hot shower then a whole pepperoni and sausage cheese pizza and washed it down with an A&W Root Beer soda. I will get my laundry done later. I also will eat my pint of Ben & Jerry ice cream as I do laundry. ""Owl"" and I got to the hostel just about the same time but couldn't figure out how to get in. We read the directions on the front entry door and went to the rear where hikers are to enter. However we did not have the combo lock number (we had it in ours hands but we didn't read the very fine print oh the hiker entry door notice) lol so we knocked and no one answered. So we waited until the opening time at 5:00 PM. Still no answer but at 5:10 another hiker opened the door and told us how to figure out the combo number. So Owl and I kept asking ourselves why didn't they open the door the first time we knocked lol. So we got a good laugh out of the one. ""OB"", Blue Bandana, Morg, Nancy & her sister Maren also made it to the hostel. I was glad to see that they made it to the hostel.

It's a real nice shelter with a skylight and it sleeps 12 with plenty of room for more. They have two picnic tables inside with plenty of room to move around. The shelter is fully enclosed with two entry/exit doors. The shelter is a converted barn on private property. I met several NOBO""s that come from springer (Digger, Tuna Wrap,) Tuna Wrap gave me two slices of meat lovers pizza ( he ordered to much). The pizza place will deliver pizza to the shelter trail head. Everyone was talking and laughing about the trail and their experience on the trail. There are nine (9) of us in the shelter (5 northbound thru hikers, 3 section hikers going southbound to Port Clinton then off the trail (they're only doing a 4 day hike), and 1 southbound hiker.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534690,"5/23/2016 I got up at 5:30AM and did stretching exercises made breakfast and packed up my gear. Went to use the jiffy John toilet and the toil was full (no way I was going to use that toilet). So, I made plans to go to the bathroom in the woods after I got on the trail. Just before I was to leave. The jiffy John service trunk came and cleaned out the John. I know you know what happened next so I spare you the details (lol). I got on the trail and about a mile into I ran into NOBO (preyamantis) that came from Springer Mountain in GA. We talked a minute an off he went at a pace I was not going to try an duplicate ( too fast for me). By the way he was fresh out of college (Virginia Tech). Later down the trail ""Jar Head"" a former Marine, who stayed in the shelter with me caught to me and we talked and walked together for a few minutes and off he went. At about 3 miles later I met ""Lucky Lucy"" on a steep rocky downhill section. She was was out for her daily six (9) mile walk. ( oh I forgot to tell you she is 80 years old and had her wood 5ft tall walking stick with her name and the year she hiked the full AT. Oh, she stands about 4'5 inches tall. We chatted and I moved on. At about 2 miles later I stopped at the 501 Overlook and took a snack break and enjoyed the view. I dedicated the view to Officers Frank Strothers and Tony Simms who lost there lives in the line of duty while working MPDC Traffic Enforcement Branch of the Special Operations Division. Today is the anniversary of Officer Strouthers death. While I continued to enjoy the view, Luck Lucy showed up and we talked a few minutes and she moved on. I left the view point 10 minutes later and passed Luck Lucy on the way. A half hour later I nearly stepped on a rattle snake that was strected half way across the trail sunning. I quickly backed off and got myself together. The snake wasn't moving even after I hit it with rocks. So I thought of waiting it out until he moved off the trail. 15 to 20 minutes passed then Lucky Lucy showed up and when I point out the snake, she was alarmed. Finally, I couldn't wait any longer so I found a 7 foot limb and used that to lift the snake up and toss him far into the bushes. He put up a fight and wasn't going easy. He struck out at the limb multiple times and lighting fast. Once I tossed him in the bushes, Luck Lucy flew past me like a real star at the Penn Relays ( lol lol). Well we moved on and I past Lucky Lucy and haven't seen her since. Two hours later it rained like hell and it started hailing ice the size of a shotgun # 9 Buck shot for over an hour. The jail was stinging like being stung by a bee. I stayed dry with my Six Moon Gatewood Cape on and didn't over heat. The rain, lightening and thunder continued for another hour as I hiked. The rain stopped for about 3 hours and the sun came out. But that was short lived when I got hit with a second storm, but not as bad as the first one. An hour after the storm ended I had reached the Heartline camp area water spring and decided to replenish my water bottles from the stream bed. Well, that didn't go well because I slipped on a shifting rock and my whole left leg went into the stream. Yep, I got soaked. After changing my socks and trousers, went back again and got my water and continued on the trail. I finally made it to the Eagles Nest Shelter where there were other thru hikers I had stayed in the shelter with the night before. I got a fire going and dried out my socks and trousers while making my dinner ( dehydrated chilli with beans and dehydrated Uncle Bens rice and dehydrated sweet potatoe the cheese and peparoni afterwards. That was my day, pretty rough for a 15.1 hike not counting the 0.3 mile hike on the Blue blazed trail to get here. The shelter is full with 9 hikers now.

Then jump ahead to Eckville Shelter ( because I missed the section from 501 Shelter to Port Clinton but from port Clinton to Eckville Shrlter I did complete that). Woke up at 5:00 AM but stayed in my sleeping bag until 6:30 then got up and had breakfast while multitasking ( packing up my gear). The shelter was full with the usual cast of characters ( me, Paint Stick, Jar Head, Tina Wrap and four section hikers whose names I don't remember) and it was wet outside. It rained very hard in the middle of the night so I had to run out into it to fetch my gear and clothes hanging on the clothes line, along with Paint Sticks socks that were drying out ( he was knocked out cold but he thanked me for the good deed. Oh, I read a few pages in Joe Massey's book ""The Erosion of The Thin Blue Line"" before falling asleep. I left the shelter at 8:15 and started mi hike day with sunshine on my mind :-). The day started to warm up and look beautiful (great day for hiking). Shortly after leaving camp I ran ""Ponch"" who had hiked from GA and was trying to make it to Port Clinton before the post office closed at moon (as fast as he was going he would major it by 11:00. As the day went on like the rocky trail continued on, the weather got really warm with clear skies. Paint Stick and I would pass one another several times before reaching Port Clinton. We both stopped to take a snack break after a five hundred foot climb just before ""Phillips Canyon Spring"". While there to section hikers came up and I immediately recognized him as he did me. It was ""Maybery Pete"" and ""Blue Berry Dan"" both from North Carolina. Mayberry Pete was born and lived in the small twin where the filmed the TV Show Mayberry RFD. But we met (April 23rd) three weeks or so earlier on the AT in Swatara Gap at the state game lands off of I-81 two miles west of the town of Lickdale, PA. They were hiking southbound and I was northbound. They were just out slack-packing for the day to cover the section from Shartlesville to Port Clinton. We all arrived in Port Clinton about the same time. Paint Stick was section hiking so this was the end point for him as well. I got to the Union House Barber Shop but it was closed. There was a note on the door saying F rank had a Doctor appointment and would reopen on Tuesday. Wow what a bust for me, I was looking forward to having some coffee and cookies and to let Frank and Rocko know I was back on the trail. Well I sat in the chair in front of the shop to ponder my next move (try to get a ride to a road that crosses the AT near or just pass the Windsor Furnace Shelter). I had already hiked that section before getting off the trail. Well, guess who showed up, Steve the man who cooked the beef stew there at the shop the last time I was there. He greeted me with a wow, when did you get back. We talked and I told him what I was trying to do and he said no problem I'll take you to the trail head. So we stopped at the Wawa where I got food for dinner and off we went to the trail head. Now that was great timing. I made it to the Eckville Shelter but only after meeting ""Polar Bear"" on the trail who steered me in the right direction (it's kind of confusing trying to find the place based on the ""AWOL"" book. And, there are none of the typical signage you see that directs you to the shelter. Well, it was another long day.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535034,"5/25/2016 13.3 miles hiked. woke up at 6:00 AM and had breakfast the packed up an got on the trail a little late today. It was 9:00 by the time I left, I was just slow probably because I was thinking of doing a short day of only 10 miles to the Allentown Shelter. But after checking my ""AWOL"" data book, I realize there was a restaurant that was 4 miles further away so I thought I would get me a meatball sub with extra cheese it was an Italian restaurant. So, I stopped at the Allentown Hiking Club shelter and took a quick snack break. Then off to the races just thinking about a meatball sub with extra cheese and marinara sauce and that what kept me going. I could taste that meatball sub with extra cheese. I was seeing that sub in my minds eye. As I continue down the trail I was passed by everyone who stayed at the Eckville shelter with me like AJ, morocco mole and his dog little wolf (a Jack terrier), and their hiking partner ""Admenturr"". Polar Bear passed me also. The climb up out of there was a brutal 1,100 feet and the rocks were relentless with no mercy on your feet. Every time you got to a smooth section of the trail it was very short lived in maybe 10 minutes and then it was back to boulders and rocks and boulders and rocks on and on for half mile at a time. The trail was brutal. The heat didn't help any. It was about 75 degrees and I was sweating like a hog and drinking water like it was going out of style just trying to stay hydrated. Once I reach the mountaintop and had a cellular signal I called Frank at the Union house barbershop to let him know I was back on the trail and that his friend Steve gave me a ride to where I ended my last hike when I got sick. As I continue down the trail I caught up with AJ at Dan's Pulpit (it's at the top of Hawk Mountain with a beautiful view looking east from the mountain top. I signed the trail register and I dedicated the mountain to my niece Ziare. After leaving Hawk Mountain, I ran into Aubach who was going south and he started in 100 wilderness. I got to another beautiful mountain and dedicated that one to all the retired members of the DC police department. I finally made it to the route 309 Pennsylvania Route 309 and the restaurant. All I wanted was a meatball sub with extra cheese and plenty of marinara sauce. But that was not to happen today, the place was closed on Wednesday. I was flabbergasted. I was floored and my morale took a 150 mile down hill plunge. I had that sub on my mind for 4 miles of extra hiking and the place was closed. Damn, how you figure that. Truly a moral buster. I was going to get two meatball subs with extra cheese and plenty of marinara sauce. I was going to eat one at the restaurant and hike the next 2 1/2 miles to my campsite. I was going to eat the second one after setting up my tent. Well dinner was chicken and rice and I put some pepperoni and Baby Bells cheese in the rice. So, the best thing about this evening was the beautiful sunset I had from my campsite. Tomorrow I will catch a beautiful sunrise also from my campsite.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535200,"5/26/2016 Hiked 12 miles. I have a beautiful sunset last night at the New Tripoli camping area. Only problem was when you needed water for cooking or to replenish your supply, you had to go down hill about 4/10th of a mile. It was a brutal down and back up trip for me this morning at 6:00 AM. I needed three liters of water. I had breakfast and broke camp at 7:20. While breaking camp, AJ stopped by and we discussed wether we would go all the way to Palmerton or stop short and stay at the shelter. Ten minute after leaving cMp I hit the first of many rock mazes. The rocks were the dude of tractor trailer tires and larger. Some were the size of small cars. Needless to say moving through the rock mazes slows your average mile per hour pace to a crawl ( unless you're a younger aggressive hiker and a risk taker). Rushing through the rock maze will only hurt you badly. When you're my age, over 65, bones break easy and falls happen often. I fell three times because the rock I stepped rotated or shifted. I did not hurt myself just my ego each time (????). Along the way i caught up to Wing Nut and his wife Lady Fox (we would pass each-other through the out the day and had a few snack breakers together. At the rock maze named Bear Rocks, I lost the trail due to poor markings. So, I visually searched to find a white blaze marking on a tree or rock. I had no luck and finally stood on the rock and yelled out "" we're the $&%# is the blaze"". Then Morocco Mole and Adventurer showed up and we all looked but did not see the blaze. So, we gambled on the way to go and we were correct ( you don't want to rock hop or climb up rocks and Boulder unnecessarily because your feet are probably killing you at the time). That was the most poorly marked section of trail I have ever seen. Well, the three of us hiked together for a while before splitting up and moving on. But, we would later pass each other. I met Hair Bear at the Bake Oven Shelter when I stopped to replenish my water bottles. Wing Nut and Lady Fox were there taking a lunch break. Morocco Mole and Adventurer along with little Wolf the Jack Russell Terrier. We all made it into Palmerton, PA at separate times. I made it in at 4:45 PM just in time to get my mail drop food supply. After picking up my supply box, I attached it to the top of my pack and hiked 5 blocks to Berts Resturant were I would stay for the night ( they let you stay in the garage on a cart and they give you a goal so you can shower all for the amazing price of $10. You can't beat the deal). Morocco Mole and his dog little wolf and Adventurer arrived the same time as me. AJ got there ahead of us. We ate dinner at the Resturant and the food was heart and the service was great and the staff was great. I have veal parmesan with spaghetti and strings beans and coconut custard pie. Oh by the way, the shower situation is a little unusual to say the least. The water was hot though ??. Yes, you did have some privacy. The overall day was just brutal on the feet and the temperature was 82 degrees and sunny. So, I sweated like a big all day with aching feet from the rocks and not to forget the three falls I took. Staying hydrated was the key thing today. In the morning I have a monster climb up out of hear. It's a 1,0000 ft climb in less than a mile ( a rocky steep hazardous climb) so wish me luck.

I had scrapple eggs home fries potatoes and three pancakes with coffee. I had a protein drink, as well.

We climb a 1100 foot mountain which was nothing but rocks some points we had to use just the hands to pull ourselves up and on our knees is 1100 foot climb in 1 mile steep steep steep and rocky rocky rocky. It took me an hour and a half to complete the climb ( ordinarily I would have hike 2-1/2 to 3 miles in that time frame). Don't care if I ever see that monster of a mountain again ( it was an ugly and brutal on the body and mind). Once at the top, I had to take a half hour break to recoup and drink plenty of fluids. After completing my break from the first climb, I run into Leah who was doing a section hike. She and I talked and we found out that her father was in the same part of Viet Nam I was and at the very same time, so we talk about Vietnam. Two miles down the trail we had another monster climb of just rocks rocks and more rocks and very steep. That climb took 30 minutes to complete ( it was brutal). At this point I am moving down the trail like a zombie stumbling over rocks missed my turn a couple times and had to retrace my steps to get back on track. Finally, I stopped and took another break to rehydrate. By the time I got to Little Gap Road four miles later, I was out of water. I checked my AWOL book and found and called Filbert B&B. Kathy, the lady that does shuttles brought me a gallon of water a 32 ounce homemade lemonade, a banana and a banana nut bread muffin. After I guzzled down the lemonade and ate the muffin & banana and a liter of water, I laid on the ground and went to sleep resting against my pack. I was in a shady spot and a nice breeze was blowing. When I woke up I realized I had slept for 45 minutes (that lets you know how exhausted and tired I was from the heat and hiking up those mountains). I went on my way feeling refreshed and refueled and just dealt with the rocky trail as I got to it. I met several people along the way and chatted with them and continued my hike. I got to Stempa Road and I called the John Stempa, the home owner who allow hikers to sleep in his garage. He picked me up along the road and took me to his garage hostel where I ran into morocco mole, little woof, wing nut, Lady Fox, Zen Master, and Pirate Pants. There were two lady section hikers but didn't get there names and a flip-flop THRU hiker. We were shuttled to Kunckletown, PA from the John Stempa house to the Kunckletown pub were we had dinner. I had sweet potato spinach and primary up and a Yongling Lager beer. We got back to the hostel garage and went to sleep was awaken several times on the night by hikers that stayed out late.

I stopped at the Leroy a Smith shelter and had lunch and rested. The rocks were slick and wet from the humidity in the air. I slipped multiple times on the rocks one time I landed into the sticker Briarbush. At that point, I had had it with the rocks and just start cursing the rocks out really loud. I reconnected with morocco mole, adventure, Little Wolf the dog, wingnut and lady Fox at the shelter. We all stopped to take a break and get out of the heat. After leaving the shelter we hiked several more miles to Pennsylvania Route 33 a place called wind gap Pennsylvania there we called a shuttle and went to a motel for the night. We decided to do that because The heat was unbearable and I'll nearest water source was several miles away and we all were running out of water quickly. We ended up at a motel called. Flower field inn and cottages. We then went to the local diner restaurant had dinner and went across the street to the ice cream store and had ice cream.

Talked to ""Wee Gillis"" for a moment he was waiting on the post office to open so he could get his size 14 shoes he special ordered because none of the trail stores had his type shoe or any shoe in a size 14. ""General Lee"" was also waiting on the post office to open do he could get his new shoes as well, yep you guessed it, he wears a size 14 also (lol they are both skinny as a rail and tall. Wee Gillis hikes in a kilt). Once the hiking began, I was getting very excited at the prospect that I would be in New Jersey very soon. As I hiked out of Delaware Water Gap and onto the I-80 bridge, there was nothing but sheer joy flowing through my body. The BAM & BOOM & A KAZAM & A WOOOPPPEeeere and a crescendo of High pitched screams of HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH. I am the hell out of PA/ aka Rocksylvainia. Damn I never would have thought New Jersey would look so good. While on the I-80 bridge I came upon the markings on the bridge walkway indicating the PA/NJ state line. I was so happy that I forgot how intimidating it was to walk across the bridge with the big tractor trailer and the wind turbulence they created. Morocco Mole's hat flew off his head but he caught it before it became debris for the Delaware River. And, poor little ""lil Woof"" was scared as hell of all the noise and the bridge shaking like a bowl of jello when the trucks passed. I confess, the shaking bridge was a little unnerving. After coming off the bridge we went into Kittatinny Point National Park (NPS) and started the long climb up the mountain to Sun Fish Pond. During the climb I felt like a slow turtle when Wee Gills and General Lee passed my like I was standing still. They were the hares and I was the tortuous. I noticed Wee Gillis had hair hiking pole and a wooden stick he was hiking with. I later found out his other stick fell into the river whe he leaned it against the guard rail to take a picture of the PA/NJ state line markings. I wondered how many other hikers lost gear to the river while taking that same picture? It was very hot by the time we made it to half way up the mountain. We saw two day hikers and then came ""Speed Trap"" zooming buy (he to was at the post office waiting on a resupply box). Made it to the summit and it was a nice view of the valley and one could see for miles. It was a beautiful sight. We made it to Sun Fish pond and ate lunch. I had 3 boiled eggs, a 1/4 lb of smoked r salmon and a snickers candy bar and a protein drink. I wanted to take a swim but there were too many snakes in the water. Well after lunch and before heading out, I ran into ""The Jersey Girls"" ( both look to be about 70) and their Husky/ Shepard dog named ""Grace"". They said the did the trail in 08"". We chatted a minute and parted ways. The trail got a little rocky and it made me think if I was in PA and the PA/NJ state line marking was a cruel joke they play in hikers. Well, the trail smoothed out for about 3-1/2 miles. I was hiking alone by the time I reached Kittatinny Mountain Summit. The 360 degree view from the summit was absolutely magnificent. I dedicated the Kittatinny summit and the gorgeous view to my deceased siblings brothers Tyrone & Winefred and sisters Doris & Katherline. After my personal dedication ceramic I had a snack and started my decent down the mountain to the AMC Mohican Outdoor Center. The decent was brutal, brutal, and brutal. Just rocks and more rocks lily he ones I left behind in Rocksylvainia. To add insult to injury, I nearly fell three times, twisted both ankles at least twice, torqued both my knees at least twice, got smacked in the head or face too many times by overgrown limbs from the bushed that crowded the trail (didn't see the branches because I was to busy watching were I was stepping so I wouldn't end of face first on the ground). Then there were the bear droppings and the trees close to the trail were bears had been clawing on to sharpen their claws. When I saw that, I went into singing mode and a very loud singing mode. I started singing "" She'll be coming around the mountain"", Holly Moses I have been deceived"", Benny and the jets"", ""Freddy's dead"", Here come Peter cotton tail hopping down the bunny trail"" and the Cisco Kid was a friend of mine"". I wanted whatever was out there that was higher in the food chain then me to know I was coming by. By the time I got down the mountain to the gravel road (Camp Road), I was exhausted and parched and my voice was shot. I went left on the road to the AMC Mohican Outdoor Cent and checked in. Adventurer and Morocco Mole were there with little woof. During check-in I bought two 24oz Gatorades and a 16 oz coke and drank them on the spot. The I ordered a club sandwich and ate it too before going to my assigned cabin bunk space. I later saw ""General Lee"", ""Shotgun"", ""Still Kickin"" and ""Captain America"" here at the Center. I called a shuttle to take me to the town of Blairstown. I got body soap, a pint of ice cream, a box of Philly Cheese stake Hot Pockets and a box of 12 Mozzarella cheese sticks. It's all gone now except the one hot pocket (figured I'd save it for breakfast (there is a microwave in the lounge area here). General Lee and I are the only two hikers in this cabin so it's nice and quite and no hearing a lot of snoring tonight.","DWG

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536165,"6/01/2016 (zero day). Woke up at 7:00 AM and walked to the main visitor center & lounge to have breakfast (coffee, bacon egg & cheese sandwich and two hot pockets and a Gatorade and protein shake). Sat and talked with Morocco Mole, Adventurer, Shotgun, Still Kickin, and Captain America before they hit the trail at 8 o'clock. I will catch up to them in about three to four days based on their schedule. I went back to the cabin and took a nap for an hour. Got up and did some more laundry, sorted out my pack things that's going home by mail (to lower my pack weight) and cleaned my pack and shoes. I saw a snapping turtle in the parking area this morning and I asked a guy sitting by his car about it ( he was waiting on the rest of the bird watching group to show up) and he said the turtle was looking for a place to lay it's eggs. I came back later and the turtle had dug a hole in the wood chip pile and had its rear end in the hole (so I guess it was laying it's eggs). And hour or two later the turtle was gone and the hole was covered. I met the camp maintenance man (Robert Rapp) and we talked about maintenance work and fixing things for about an hour (he's retired and this is his part time gig three days a week he also repairs violins and stringed instruments). At 2:40 ""cucous"" (from Bavaria Germany) & Josh (a NOBO flip-flopper) and ""Bloody Nose"" came in for a short break they're doing 24 miles today). I had to contact the ULA (Ultra Light Associates) to send me another pack waist belt. The one I have now is to large now that I have lost weight (so the pack slips and ride on my lower back and not my hips). The ULA company is express mailing me a new waist strap that I'll get when I reach Vernon, NJ (about three and a half to four hiking days away, 52.5 miles). I met Dys-feng-shui-nal. My mail drop came in at about 4:35 and I'm now all packed up for the morning. I called and made arrangements for a shuttle to take me to the post office so I can mail stuff home and then a ride to the trail head. With any luck I should be back on the trail by 9:30 am. Dud-feng-shui-nal and Nick (a Naval Lieutenant 3rd grade) and I stayed up talking for an hour or so. It was very interesting and we had fun. Time for bed got to get up early. Good night.","AMC Mohican Outdoor Center

I called the shuttle guy who would take me to the post office and then the trail head. The shuttle driver is a retired police officer from Morristown PA. We had a good conversation on law enforcement and the changing times of the profession. I got to the PO and mailed my package home. Dave the driver dropped me at the trail head and off I went down the the trail (Dave did not charge me anything for the shuttle so that was my trail manic for the day). About 6 miles into my hike, while taking a break in the shade on Rattle Snake Mountain, I met an outward bound program group of kids on trail with their leader. The were all African American kids from west Philadelphia. Their group leader Was a Silver Spring, MD resident who attended White Oak Middle school and the Blake High School. He was taught by Saundra Woods a friend of mine. So, I knew most of his teachers at White Oak. It just goes to show you it's a small world and you never know who you'll run into. I met ""Boy Floyd"" & ""Groceries"" they were SOBO's (South-bounders) while taking a break on the rocks in the shade. I got to the shelter and was the only one here. That was good because I got first pick on a spot to sleep. I quickly set up my sleeping pad and bag. Shortly after that three hikers I was with two nights ago showed up, then two SOBO section hikers and a NONO section hiker (Payricia) showed up. So, there are seven of us in the shelter tonight and it looks like rain is coming. Well, two more showed up so there are nine in the shelter. The Outward Bound youths are camping about 75 yards from the shelter and the are loud and having fun down there. I hope they go to bed early. Good night I got an early day tomorrow and some long miles.","AMC Mohican Outdoor Center

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536431,"6/3/2016 ( Hiked 11.6 miles) I got up st 6:00 AM it was raining light to moderate while I made breakfast (grits, granola bar and coffee). I broke camp and hiked a half mile and realized I missed the AT trail turnoff (trail leading from shelter to AT turnoff is poorly marked). I finally got back on track and continued my hike in the morning rain. As I hiked along the rocky ridge line, I slipped and fell on the wet slick rocks. I was fortunate I landed on my left side and had no known injuries (just a little sore at the wrist area that helped to break my fall). I came off the mountain thinking of a hot lunch at the Sunrise Deli. When I got down to US Rte 206, to my surprise the deli was closed ( what a bummer). Well, I ended up at Gyps Pub (in Culvers Gap) and had a burger, sweet potato fries, mozzarella cheese sticks and a Gatorade. Then I walked the 2 miles to and back from Dales Market in Branchville to resupply. While at the Deli counter, I saw a lady wearing a sweatshirt that read ""The Marines, the few the proud a Marines Mom"". I engaged her in conversation and asked her to tell her son "" From one Marine to another SEMPER FI"". With that we had a great conversation. The lady (Marjorie Sietsma) turns out to be a blessing for me with her ""Trail Magic"" offering. To my surprise, she paid for my resupply. May God continue to bless her with good health and life. You are a very special person and the work you do to help military members and veterans is just awesome (Adopt-a-Soldier Platoon, Inc). You're the greatest. Again, thank you so very much for helping this Marine Veteran it was greatly appreciated. After getting back on the trail, I met several other thru-hikers that were headed to the Mashipacong Shelter. My destination was the Gren Anderson shelter. The views along the was were obscured by the fog and rain (the lake and the valley). I reached the ""Culvers Fire Tower"" but it was locked and the view to the east and west was were fogged-in. I met ""wimbily-wobbler"" at the tower. Once I reached the shelter, I met Jack (aka Snores). Unbeknownst to me, he was following me on my real journal page. Snores turn out to a trail angle for me because he had brought some cold Pepsi to the shelter that was right on time to go with my foot long turkey sub I had gotten from the market. Snores mentioned that he had missed catching up to me in Culver Gap. Well, i had a great time talking with him and truly appreciate his efforts to help out AT hikers. Snores you're the best man. Thank you for all you do to help out hikers and veterans like me. The had candy will go a long way in helping me get over the mountains. I am truly glad we got to meet each other. And thank you for the RC Maple mini. Thank you for offering your help if we needed anything. While Snored and talked, ""Nova"" (she's from Nova Scotia) walked into camp and she was offered the last Pepsi. She franker it and we talked a few minutes the she left for the next shelter to catch up with friends. After Snores left, ""Babbit"" walked into camp. We talked a little while he ate. Then he and ""wimbily-wobbler"" went to bed early (6:30 PM). I went to the creek to get water for tomorrow and to writ this page. Ok, I'm gonna eat again then go to bed. Good night everyone. One more time, a big thank you to my two ""Trail Magic"" friends Marjorie and Jack (aka Snores).","Brink Shelter

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536824,"6/4/2016 ( hiked 13 miles). I woke up at 6:00AM made breakfast and started my hike to High Tower Shelter. There was a group of med school students from Philadelphia out hiking for the weekend that camped just beyond the shelter. Along the way to High Tower, I met several thru hikers going northbound and two going southbound and I talked with each of them. I find it interesting talking to other hikers about the trail and life in general. It also gives me a little standing on my feet rest/ break time. I reached Sunrise Mountain and only saw a slight view of the surrounding countryside. The pavilion there is pretty nice. From there I was told, on a clear one can see the tri-state area NY-NJ-PA. If it only was a clearer day. I left Sunrise Mountain and later stopped at Mashipacong Shelter for a lunch break. I met Amy (aka Roadrunner) and she had just put some treats and great water in the bear box. This shelter has no reliable water source within a half a mile and the next water source is seven (7) miles away at High Point Shelter. So, trail angles like Roadrunner bring in water and snacks for the thru-hikers. It was a great blessing because the snacks were good. I carried an extra two (2) liters of water with me to this shelter thinking I will need it for my lunch and to get me to High Point. With forest water at hand and the stifling humidity, I dranked until I was full to the gills. While I was at the shelter, ""LL Retro"", "" Dutch"" and ""Clean Skittles"" showed up and were in awe of all the Grady left in the bear box ( they were like little kids in a candy store). I left and hit the terai knowing I had seven more miles of unknown terrain to navigate. Little do I know how Rocky and unforgiving the trail ahead would be. The trip was so rocky that I almost thought I was back in PA (lol lol). After a few near falls and rocks stabbing my foot, I. came upon a banded brown snake on the trail ( I nearly stepped on it). I made it to the wooden tower and walked up to the observation platform to enjoy the views but to cloudy and overcast to see much of anything. I pushed on to the High Point Shelter where the usual cast of thru-hiker characters gathered. I checked the log book and found that Morocco Mole, Adventurer and little woof are just a day ahead of me. I'll probably catch them in a day or two. I made dinner and off to bed early. I was tired from dealing with all the rocks. Good night.","Gren Anderson Shelter

The projected weather was heavy rains around 1:00 PM and hail and rain at about 4:00 to 6:00 PM. Well, I decided to make it a shirt day and hike to the Jim Murray property shelter and wait out the storm. Along the way, I saw a snapping turtle on the trail near a pond. I made it to the shelter and met the property owner (Jim Murray) and thanked him for his generosity to me and the thru-hikers he has allowed to use his property over the last twenty years. I was the only hiker there until ""Purple"" and xxxxxx showed up with their dog ""Monkey"". I got in just a half hour befit the first of scrawl downpours happened. The others hot in about 2:00 in the middle of a downpour. Monkey was cold and wet so they wrapped him up and put him in their sleeping bag to get warm. The hail never came but the torrential downpours certainly did over and over again. Felt good being in the shelter. In between downpours I took a hot shower ( it's an outdoor shower with no walls). The water was nice and hot for sure. afterward I fell off to sleep for a few hours. I got up and had dinner and started catching up no my journal entries. The night sky has cleared up from the torrential rains we had. The stars are beautiful and it's very quite out here on the farm. Ok all, time to go to bed I have a long day ahead of me tomorrow. I'm hiking to either Unionville, NY or Vernon, NJ. Tomorrow, I will be bouncing back and forth across state lines of NJ/NY several times during my travel.","High Point Shelter

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537049,"6/6/2015 ( hiked 13.5 miles). I got up at 5:00 AM made breakfast and packs up my gear. The clothes were still damp from all the moisture in the air ( humidity was 87%). The hike was going well until I got to the Wallkill Wildlife Reserve. I missed the right turn and continued straight ahead on Stateline Rd until I realized didn't see any white blazes. By now I'm at Liberty Ct and the kiost for the reserve. I walked over to the kiost to see where I was in the reserve, but no luck no maps showing ""You are here"" I Checked my book and turned around and went back to where I last saw a white blaze. I missed the turn because the post with the blaze was nearly overgrown with bushes (the trail here in NJ had given me plenty of worries due to its poor maintenance and trail markings. I stopped at the Pochuck Mtn Shelter for lunch ( pop tart with peanut butter and pepperoni). While having lunch, ""O"" showed up but stayed only for a quick snack. The ""Diguidou"" he's a Frenchman (the trail name now that's French for what I don't know). Before I left, the girl ""Waldo"" walked in and started emptying ever thin from her pack. She said her tent sprung a leek from all the rain last night ( I was soaking wet like it just came out of the washing machine while on soak cycle). I offered her duct tape to patch any holes but she said she was good. I there and continued my hike towards Vernon, NJ. When I got to Lovemma Lane ( gravel road) I ran into Bob and his Dashiubd dog. (a retired police office). He ask for directions to County Rd / Rte 517. I checked my book and informe him that he had overshot his destination or what he was looking for. He thanked me an continued on southbound. When I reached Pochuck Creek Suspension bridge, I took a snack break. While doing so, Bob came past and realized he left his car at the AT parking area at NJ Rte 94. I told him that was about 2.4 miles up the trail. So off he went. I left after my break and caught up to and passed home. However, we ended up at the trail Boardwalk that runs for about a mile and a half and is elevated above the swampy marshland. While walking the elevated platform he an I talked about police work. By the time we reached the cow pastures he offered me a ride to the post office and hostel in Vernon, NJ. Once clear of the pasture ( the cows were moving across the wood planks we were walking on. The one cow apparently decided to just blocked the woof planks. Bad timing for me because I was just about to pass the area when it all happen. So I had a conversation with the cow to get her to unblock my path. That didn't work well so I around her to pass. We reached Bob's care and he gave me a ride to town ( it saved me from having to walk an additional two miles to the town of Vernon). We parted ways and I went into the hostel and got a hot shower, ice cream, a coke, and did my laundry (when you start to smell like ammonia, the you know you're smelling bad). After laundry, I went to Burger King and had an original chicken sandwich, medium fries, large root beer soda and a Jr Wopper w/ cheese. Then I went to CVS and got trail candy and nutrition bars and muscle milk. Then on to Dunkin Donuts where I got 4 assorted donuts. I got back to the hostel s ate all the donuts and dranked one of the muscle milk with them. Then I saved the best for last. I ate the snickers candy bar with the lady of my root beer soda. Finally I got to repack my pack and while doing so, the church Minister came in to check on Everton and to ask if anyone needed anything. I struck up a conversation with the Minister ( who at one time very briefly served on the Baltimore City Police Dept). He as Lao attended American University in DC. We had a great conversation about police work, the ministry (I told him of all my cousins and, I named all of them in SC that are Ministers). He was great to talk to and to listen too as well.

The best thing about today was trail magic by Paul who had a time of drinks candy and fruits and nuts. I did a video with myself and Paul at his truck. I had a Gatorade walnuts blueberries candy bar and more package peanuts that I ate before climbing the mountain at Harrington state park here in New York. It was really nice having that kind of trail magic at the right time I was just thinking about stopping to eat when that came about great timing Paul was a very nice person I really enjoyed talking with him before heading up the mountain.

When I got to the shelter at 7:00 PM last night, the shelter was full to capacity. I had to setup my Six Moon Gatewood Cape shelter with bug net insert. I was cold and hungry when I got to the crowded shelter. I quickly set up my cape/tent then got something hot to eat (Ramon noodles with peanut butter and pepperoni). I got warmed up and slept good through the night. As I said earlier, I left camp by 7:00 AM. While hiking to the Wm. Brien Memorial Shelter. The steep up and down hill ascents and descents weren't to bad. The trail today was much better surface wise. The overall condition of the trail is just poor. The trail hasn't been very well maintained this year. There are numerous blow downs blocking the trail, there are many areas are poorly blazed (you can spend a total of one hour out of your hiking day just searching for the blazes). About 75% of the trail has overgrown vegetation encroaching on the trail. So, you're constantly being slapped in the face or clothing getting snagged by the overgrown vegetation. The trail is lazed over steep slick rock face. There is a lot of hand over hand climbing along with very narrow foot or hand holds to assist you. I made it to the Wm Brein Shelter and had lunch. There were 5 teenagers there who camped out overnight. They had a big fire going when I got there. It was nice talking with them and I moved on. I reached the West Mtn. Shelter and ""LL Retro"" was there. I made diner and we talked before I took a nap. Got up about 5:40 pm and Morocco Mole, Adventurer And Lil Woof came into camp. We all talked then I made a fire and were enjoyed the warmth it provided. We all were waiting on night fall so we could see the NY City skyline lights. We have a good view of Mid-Town Manhattan, view of the Hudson River, the Indian Point nuclear power plant. We can also see Newark, NJ from this location.

LL Retro was already packed up and said his good good bye. I packed up and headed out at 6:45 AM. When I left morocco mole little woof and Adventura we're just getting up to eat breakfast. I broke camp and hiked for two hours then took a break. I stopped at bear Mountain on the east slope and took pictures and posted the pictures on Facebook The climb up the mountain was a good climb of about 1300 feet with lots of steps going up and coming down the mountain. At the west side of the mountain, there is an observation tower, I only went halfway up into the tower to see the view of the Hudson river and came back down. Afterwords, I stop at the vending machines got a Gatorade and Pringles potato chips. I saw ""Purple"" she was complaint about her foot possibly having a fracture and trying to get an Uber ride to the hospital. ""Six Legs"" & ""Grandma was there as well. I grabbed my pack and got back on the trail to go down the mountain. I passed the Bear mountain park and beach area. I went through Bear Mountain Park and along the lake and through the museum and zoo. I saw my first bear (it was in a cage at the zoo). I saw other through hikers there and then we continued on down the trail. I reached the Appalachian trail deli and got me an a Italian sub sandwich, Gatorade and a muscle milk and two slices of pizza. I said at the outdoor table and ate all of that then laid on the grass and took a ten minute nap. Either through hikers were there doing the same thing eating and taking a nap on the grass. I left there and hiked the mile and a half to the Graymoor spiritual center. When I arrived there are several through hikers already staked out their place in the pavilion. So, I had to set up my tent on the ballfield. I ate dinner which was another sub sandwich and dranked a Coke (Merlin's friend brought a cooler full of sodas as trail Majic). I took a cold shower and filled up my water bottles for tomorrow. Ok, it's bed time. I got an 18 mile day tomorrow to the RHP Shelter. Looking at the weather, it suppose to rain at about noon.

I hiked several miles before taking taking a break. Shortly there after it rained very hard for several hours. It was tough going on the rocks they were all slick so I slipped and fell a couple times but no injuries. The trail is routed up and down hills of nothing but rocks. The rocks are covered with lichen and are very slick when wet. After the rain, I took off my rain gear and stop for lunch break on the trail at the top of the mountain. I posted my lunch break on Facebook. I continued my hike and came across a 5 foot long black snake on the trail. The snake was lying on a tree root in the sun. I almost stepped on its tail. Apparently the snake felt the vibration of my footsteps and my hiking sticks and scurried off into the bushes. I got a picture of it and posted it on Facebook. Along the way, I got off trail several times because the trail is poorly marked. I had to climb over or around or squeeze under a lot of trees that have fallen on the trail. Going uphill on the trail was treacherous. Going downhill on the trail was equally treacherous because of the slick rocks and midd. Several times I had to refer to my Guthook app to determine where exactly on the trail was I located. The AWOL book did not have certain information. So, if you got off trail it was a lot of walking back-and-forth to determine where the next blaze was located. So today I spent probably a total of 30 minutes finding which way to turn at certain junctions or which direction the trail was going because of poor blazing. I am not the only one with this problem. Two out of every three through hikers I come across and have been hiking with for several days have complained of the same problem ( poorly blazed Trail. The fallen trees on the trail and the overgrown bushes that reach out and scratched you about the face arms and legs). I made it to the Clarence Fahnestock State Park at about 6:30 PM. It took me so long to get there because of the slippery and slick wet conditions of the trail, and the poor blaze markings. Trying to keep a two mile per hour pace on the PA-NJ and NY sections of the trail is almost a pipe dream. The conditions will slow you down to a crawl. After setting up my tent, I ran across Walkman Who was looking for campsite. So he decided to camp next to where I am. We talked and had dinner and he went to bed early. I went to bed about 9 o'clock. Shortly after going to bed, The people two campsites away (and it's a large group of people) are hooping and hollering and setting off fireworks. I don't think this was probably the best place to camp tonight LOL they're having a good old fashion party or something over there with all the fireworks. All the parks staff people are gone for the night. When you call the park office telephone, the recording tells you to call the New York state park police if you have any emergency. So, that means there's no one to call and tell them to have the other campers to quiet down. Hopefully they will quiet down and I can get some sleep it's already 10:45 PM. Tomorrow will be a short day of 11 miles and I'm sure I will be sleeping late tomorrow morning LOL. Good night all.","Graymoor Spritial Life Center

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537951,"6/12/2016 (Hiked 12.7 miles). I woke up this morning at six I intended to sleep later because of the hoopla last night with the fireworks and the people at the other campsites. Instead, I got up made my breakfast oatmeal with almonds, raisins and walnuts. I packed up and took a shower at the shower house and had coffee and left the campground. The trail was somewhat easy going but still a lot of rocks and still a lot of unmarked areas, but overall it went well. I had a 700 foot climb and an 1100 foot climb today before reaching New York Route 52. I stopped at the RPH shelter and had lunch and take a half hour nap. Afterwords, I went to the privi and then started the 1100 foot climb to the top of the mountain. At the viewpoint at the top of the mountain, I run into three day hikers ( one had completed the AT in 2005). I talked with them for a few minutes and continued on. The terrain got rougher because of the rocks and the wind was blowing at about 35 miles an hour with Wind gust up to about 40 to 50 miles an hour. The clouds were starting to move in and it look like I was going to get rained on again. So, I was trying to get to the top of the mountain before the rain but it did not come. Got a phone call from Wendy and Tracy in reference firearms instruction. I hiked most of the day with ""Shotgun"" and ""Walkman"" and we all had lunch together at the RP H shelter. Shotgun continued on to the next campsite at Morgan Stewart shelter. Walkman and I decided to make it an early day (didn't want to get caught by the rain) and stopped at the deli on NY route 50 ""the mountaintop market deli"" near Fishkill, NY. At the deli, I got a resupply of food so that I could make it to my food drop location which is in Kent Connecticut. At the deli I had a fried chicken breast sandwich on rye bread. At the camping area behind the deli and pizza place there were several other thru-hikers that I had been moving with for the past couple days. They all had pizza so I had pizza along with my sandwich and two Gatorade's, a muscle milk and a Coca-Cola and a bag of potato chips. I wanted ice cream but it was to cold with the wind blowing in about 20 miles an hour with wind gusts up to about 30 miles an hour and the temperature down to 48Â° with the wind chill. On the trail I saw a milk snake and it scurried across the Trail in front of me very fast. Thats the only wildlife I saw day aside from some chip monks, frogs and spotted salamanders. When I reach the top of the Shenandoah mountains I can see the American flag painted on the rock in honor or memory of 911. I stopped and had a snack thre and again at Hosner Mountain Road. I talked with Walkman for a little bit before we continued on to our destination of New York Route 52 in Stormville New York. I resupplied at the deli and now I'm all packed up and ready to go in the morning. I have enough food to make it to Kent Connecticut, which is about three days away. Even though the wind was blowing hard, the air smelled nice and pure and fresh. Walking along the ridge of the mountain today with the wind blowing you could hear everything and it created an atmosphere where you could just let your mind wander, but not too far because you could trip on a tree root or rock and land on your face LOL. On several occasions coming down off the mountain, I stepped on a piece of twig that was perpendicular to the trail and it rolled from under my foot causing me to slip forward. Even though you have plenty of time to think about all sorts of things you still can't let your mind wander too far because of the hazards of the trail. I did that the other day and walked into a tree overhanging the trail. Just so happen the tree was about 5'4""off the ground and I'm only 5'6"" so it jarred me pretty good right around the Noggin (lol). But I love the peace and serenity and the camaraderie of the people on the trail. I've had a blast and still having fun hiking the Appalachian trail. More people should get out and hike and see this beautiful country and all the fantastic views that the Appalachian trail has to offer. The Appalachian trail is called the Appalachian national scenic Trail. And that it is. There's nothing to be afraid of on the Appalachian trail, the views are beautiful and it's a great way to exercise and definitely get your cardiovascular workout in. You can meet some great people on the Appalachian trail. I've met people that know people I know and I've met people who have work in places that I have worked in and have gone to school in my neighborhood. That just goes to show how small the world is and no matter how large it seems it is still a small world. I take a lot of pictures and do a lot of videos that I put on Facebook and pictures that I put on my trail journal page, but then I have to delete them because I run out of storage space. I haven't come to a place where I can use a computer and download the pictures and video onto a thumb drive and mail home. I'm still trying to figure out a way to save the videos because most of the time they are too long to email. So if anyone out there have a suggestion please let me know how I can transfer video and picture from my phone to a thumb drive or storage device so, I can send them home and not have to erase them due to a lack of storage space. Well, I have a long day tomorrow so good night to all.","Clearence Fahnestock State Park

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538057,"6/13/2016 (hiked 11.7 miles). I was awaken this morning at 4:30 AM by the loud noise coming from the cement factory a 100 yard away. Not to mention the loud party at the house on the other side of the bushes. The people there stayed up and partied until 1:00 AM. They shit off fireworks and blasted the music. I thought I was reliving the night before at the park ( with the roust bunch there shooting off fireworks and it not even July 4th. I eventually got up at 5:30 when the deli opened and got coffee and a sausage egg and cheese on a bagel. I day at the outdoor table with the other hikers and ate and talked. I packed up and hit the trail at 6:45 AM. I hiked for several hours before taking a break at Mt. Egbert I took pictures and a video and posted them on Facebook. I hiked on until I reached the Morgan Stewart Shelter where I had lunch. I left the shelter and stopped to replenish my water at the creek near old NY Rt 55. There I saw the other hikers I stayed with last night ( they too where getting water ). While there, I met Erin Clancy a former Navy Corpsman ( I then called him ""Doc"" the name we used or called them when I was in the Marine Corps in Viet Nam). We had a great conversation. Doc is also a mental health manager. Doc talks about his emergency preparedness organization wanting to do something to assist the THRU hikers which included setting up a mobil shower trailer. After receiving his blessings and prayer, I moved on to my hiking. While hiking, I came up the lake and thought about taking a swim but it was a little to windy. The other reason for not doing a swim was related to the name of the lake. The name of the lake was ""Nuclear Lake"". I surely didn't want to swim there lol. However, the other hikers I was with did stop and took a swim in the lake at the south end of the lake. At the north end of the lake, I got to see some very pretty ducks (I think they are called Mallard docks. After taking pictures, I moved on. Shortly there after, I came across a black lizard with gray patched on its body. The thing tried to play dead. I videoed it and posted it to Facebook. I moved on a reached the shelter and claimed me a spot before the other hikers arrived. Well, a whole crew of hiked showed up and the shelter is gulled. I'm glad I got there first otherwise I might had to pitch my tent. Five of the hikers left just before dark so they could camp at the train stop because they wanted to catch the 5:30 AM train to NU City for a few days off the trail. They were a little loud and playing a guitar. I'm glad they are gone for the night. What a rest day it was to home. Ok all, I'm hitting the sleeping bag because I got and early morning.

I finally put my iPod ear buds in and listened to music to go back to sleep. I woke up at 6:00 AM and made breakfast of oatmeal with two pop tarts crushed up and mixed in and hade coffee. I packed up and hit the trail at 8:00 AM (a little later than Planned. I hiked until I reached the Appalachian Trail train station/stop and dumped my trash. I left there and stopped at the Native Landscape Garden Center near Pawling, NY (they are an AT friendly business. I met Pam and Jason who were really supper great people. I charges up my phone and battery charges pack, used the rest room and purchased a few items ( protein bars, a dehydrated meal and a bottle of coconut water). I really had a great time there talking with Jason and Pam. Pam and I talked about everything from gentrification to politics to health care and living in NY and the DC Metro area. She was very familiar with the DC area. When I checked the time, I realized I'd been there an hour and a half (way beyond what was supposed to be a half or break stop). I had a good time so no worries lol. That was one of the best rest stops on the entire trail I have travelled. Well eventually, I got back to the trail and hiked seven miles before stopping to replenish my water. Along the way I saw two garden snakes on the wooden board walk going through the swamp River area. Before that, I saw a four foot black snake basking in the sun on the wooden boardwalk over the swamp area. I stopped at the Wiley Shelter and had lunch (Chilly Mac). Walkman stopped in and rested while I ate. While eating, I saw a baby black snake slinking along side the fire pit. The snake had a white ring around its head. A group of five young men stopped in and ate lunch as well. They were out hiking just for a few days. I left the shelter to make it to my campsite for the night and to cross over into Connecticut. I crossed over into Connecticut at 4:30 PM and it was a great feeling. I made it to the Ten Mile River shelter at 5:30 and made dinner. A father and son was at the shelter so I talked with them while eating dinner. They are only out for a few days. After dinner, a deer walked right past the shelter and ignored us (they must be protected or its not deer hunting season yet for them not to be afraid of humans). Well that's how my day went.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538379,"- [ ] 6/15/2016 (hiked 8.4 miles). I woke at 6.00 AM but did not start making breakfast until 7:00 AM. I felt tired and judged wanted to stay in my sleeping bag. Eventually I got up and made breakfast and talked with Walkman, Dave and Morgan before packing up and heading out on the trail. The hike started out on good terrain downhill and a road walk and a smooth soft surface first road walk. I knew it was to good of a walk to be true. Then I hit the uphill that lasted for 1,300 grueling feet of climbing. Then the heat kicked in at 75 degrees and most of the time I was exposed to the sun. At the top of the mountain there was a gorgeous view to the west and there was a nice shady spot on a big rock with my name on it. Yes, I took it and settled in for a test break and a snack. It was really peaceful and serene. After a half hour, ""Hail"" and ""Unknown "" showed up looking like to whipped puppies. Then Morgan shows up looking the same. So, I guessed I mist have looked like an old worn out rag when I got to the top. I never saw Walkman or Dave before I left the top of what I thought was the top. To my surprise I had another three hundred feet to go to the top. When I got to the official top of the mountain, I saw ""Quicksand"" and we hadn't seen each other since Maryland. It was good seeing him again. We spoke for a few moments and he moved on. The terrain change to slight rolling sort of hills for bout a mile then came the second big climb of 800 feet. Now that climb took the wind out of my sails. It was tonight and Rocky and poorly blazed. At the top there were no views and no breeze blowing but the heat was relentless. I found a shady spot and took a break and had a protein snack bar. The trail crossed back into NY and then back into CY at the water stream near Indian Rocks. This is where I replenishes my water. I was drinking as much as I could ( I drink 32 ounces at the stream). The water was cold and good. Did not see any wildlife on there than chipmunks and squirrels (that's fine with me). Coming down off the second mountain was brutal on the feet and knee with all the rocks and dry leaves that cause you feet to slide from under you when your feet are at a downward angle. I made it off the mountain with out injury but quite a few slips that could have been disastrous. I made it to the shelter and claimed me a spot. Shortly thereafter ""3 Jack"" and ""Spark"" showed up. Then came ""Chardonnay"" . Later Morgan, Dave and Walkman all showed up. Every onset up either tents or hammocks. ""Cat and GPS"" came back geometry there venture into the town of Kent. I'll be going there tomorrow to the PO and the Outfitter store. I'll also be catching a shuttle ride to the train station so I can go home for my 67th birthday. I haven't taken a zero day off in a month. The tow rugged climbs I had to do today let me know it's time to take a day off and rest he body. I have a few aches and pains going on that I'll have my doctors check out when I get home. I plan to return to the trail on Tuesday or Wednesday. Well it's time to say good night to all.","Ten Mile River Shelter

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539288,"6/16/2016 (Hiked 2.3 miles). I woke up at 5:30 and rolled back over because I was in no hurry to get up for the day. I had called the shuttle driver yesterday to make arrangements for transportation to the Pawling, CT train station at or about 2 to 3 oâclock today. I went back to sleep and finally got up at 9:30 and made my breakfast. After breakfast, I tended to my laundry that was drying on the line . The laundry was still damp. I then began checking my data book for my hike in to Kent, CT. I lounged around at the shelter for another hour and packed up my pack and hit the trail to the road crossing. I hiked into Kent and stopped at the Backcountry Outfitters (which also contain the Annie Bananie Ice cream parlor). I checked in with the clerk and ascertain what time the train leaves for NY Grand Central Station. The clerk said she would check and get back to me and she did. The train was scheduled to leave Pawling at 4:20 PM. It was now about noon so I decided to have lunch at the ice cream polar. I had the grilled cheese with poached egg sandwich and pop-corn. It was delicious so, I had two of them, three cups of coffee and, two 32.oz gatorades. after that, I had the large ice cream cup of coconut vanilla ice cream. After eating, I walked to the post office and got my mail drop but did not open it. I had it returned to my home address since I was going home today. On the way back to the Outfitters, I stopped to talk with Walkman, who was online on his phone trying to order a new pack from REI. We talked a few minutes and I headed back to the outfitters store. I passed several other hikers along the way that was at the shelter with me last night. I got back to the outfitters shop and plugged in my phone battery charger to refinished charging it and my IPod. While in the ice cream parlor, Chardonnay (who I met at the shelter) came over to talk with me and we had a good conversation and took a selfie together. She said she was cutting back on her daily mileage because her feet and legs were starting to give her problems. She said she had been doing twenty to twenty-five miles a day since getting into VA coming north from Springer Mountain in GA. Its not unusual for a lot of the hikers to be doing that kind of daily mileage. I just out right refuse to punish my body and feet by walking that far everyday carrying a 27 to 30 pound pack on my back. Some of the hikers I met walking those 20 to 25 miles per day are carrying packs that weights in at 35+ pounds (a lot of it is food because of the calories they are burning up each day). My maximum miles are between 10 and 15 miles a day. However, I did do several 16 and 17 mile days because of the distance between the shelters. After talking with Chardonnay, I went outside and sat on the bench in the shade and enjoyed the weather as I waited for the shuttle driver. One the driver arrived, I loaded my pack in the flatbed of the truck and off to the train station. I arrived with time to spare and time to purchase my train ticket from the Kiosk machine to Grand Central Station, NY. I boarded the train on time and had a full row of seats to myself (three seats across). I stretched out and went to sleep until my stop at the Southeastern Station where I would change trains to get to Grand Central Station. When I got to GCS (Grand Central Station) it was like a zoo, people everywhere rushing and running and mass confusion to be it was probably controlled daily chaos to them. I learned a lot about how to get where I was going on this trip. Arriving at GCS, I had to take the shuttle train to Times Square then another train to Pen Station where I caught the Amtrak Train to Union Station in Wash., DC. I was a 7+ hour long train adventure and very tiring.","Mt Algo Shelter

Went to my medical appointment to find out what the aches and pains were that I had been hiking with over the past several week. Wee, unfortunately the news from the doctor was not good. I was informed that I had been hiking with a Hernia that was continually slipping out through my abdominal wall. The doctor further explained to me that had i continued to hike and ignore the problem, it could have led to a dire emergency that could result in death. On that note, I am certainly glad I made the decision to come off the trail and get checked. I was referred to a surgeon (who I will see next week) who will surgically repair the tear in my abdominal wall. So, with that news, I will be off the trail for a few weeks until I heal and get the Doctors approval to go back on the trail. As all of my followers should know, this is a big disappointment for me but, I have to deal with it and my health always come first. So Iâll adapt, adjust and overcome this.

My thru hike plans have been put on hold because of the surgery. I'm doing and recovering well and now planing to redstart my thru-hike adventure in 2017. I had to wait so long to get the surgery that I have loss my trail legs and will need to retrain and get in shape again. Because of that, I now plan to start a new thru-hike come April 2017 and start at Springer Mtn. and end at MT. Katahdin. I will not skip over the 500+ miles I've already done from Shenandoah to kent, CT.. Yes, as much as I would like to do that (just to pass over rocky PA), I feel as though I'm a purest and need to pass every AT white blaze. So, i'll be doing the AT the traditional way (GA to ME).

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551182,"Today was my second training hike after my post surgery recovery period. Purpose of the hike was to test my new pair of trail shoes (North Face Ultra109). This is the same shoe brand I attempted my thru-hike in. The 2nd purpose of the hike was to test my mobility after the hernia surgery. The shoes performed as well as I suspected so I feel good about that. The stress of the trail with its ups and downs and the rock/scree field I had to navigate posed no noticeable issues related to my surgery. The hike was on the AT starting at the Cedar Run Trail at Hawksbill parking area along Shenandoah Pkwy mile 45.5. The hike up to Hawksbill summit (the highest point in Shenandoah National Park aaas not much of a challenge at only a 700 ft gain in elevation. The summit was crowded with visitors who were enjoying the Fall foliage colors of reds, oranges and yellows with speckles of green. I had a snack of Ritz crackers with summer sausage and moved on to my next location of Rock Spring Hut. I arrived at Rock Spring hut and was met there by a husband and wife who were out for a day hike and was having lunch. We spoke for awhile before they packed up and and left. I was trying out a new cook system kitchen named the Caldera Kitchen with Evernew .6 L pot (ECA-251). The system worked well and the .6L pot was just the right size for my mac & cheese dinner. I love it. By the way its an alcohol stove with windscreen and the pot fit and sit perfectly on the windscreen for even heating and cooking. While I was eating my lunch a SOBO thru-hiker named ""Dude"" with his dog were at the bear box retrieving their food. Dude was taking a zero day here because he did not get any sleep the night before due to a large contingent of Boy Scouts and Girl scouts camping out that night. Dude and I talked for a while reminiscing about the trail he traveled and I what I had covered from CT to Shenandoah. Dude started his thru-hike on Katahdin the first week of August.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551424,"November 11, 2016 TRAINING HIKE #3 (Miles Hiked 10): Hiked on this Veterans Day in honor of myself and all the men and women who have and are continuing to serve in defense of this country. And, a special tribute to my deceased brother US Marine Sgt. Tyrone M. Rorie who served in Viet Nam in 1968 at Keh Sanh during the 77 day siege. May he rest in peace. Another purpose of the hike was to determine how my sew North Face ultra 109 trail shoes would perform on the rugged rocky terrain and to determine what would be my final cook / kitchen set up would be. I started at Pen Mar Park at the MD/PA line and hiked south on the AT. I navigated the rocky low lying area just before Quirauk Mountain without any issues with the trail shoes. They held up well for that section of the hike. While in the low lying rock section, I met a day hiker who was sort of confused as to which direction to travel due to a lack of white blazes (yes, this section is poorly marked and many of the blazes are faded). Because of my familiarity with this area, I directed him in the right direction and had him follow me until we cleared that section.he had told me he was out walking again after knee surgery and would be moving slow. I moved on ahead and ascended the mountain and later took the âBlue Blazedâ trail to High Rock Overlook. It was a beautiful day with temps in the low 60âs but windy with gust up to 20 mph. The view from High Rock is always beautiful and stunning. This was once used as a launching pad for hang gliders but no more due to a few deaths. But, the view of the valley looking north towards PA is beautiful. I took my break here to take in the beauty and snack on some trail mix. I left the overlook and headed back onto the AT where I ran into the day hiker Paul, who just made it to that point and said he was calling for a ride to take him back to Pen-Mar Park (which is just a short car ride down the mountain road). The hike to Raven Rock Shelter was uneventful which is always good. But, I did run into several groups of hikers who were planing weekend hikes on the MD section of the AT. I made it to Raven Rock Shelter. This is a great shelter with plenty of camping space and several fire ring areas with a cable system for hanging your food. The shelter is relatively new (about 5 years of less). It has a elevated sleeping area that will hold 5 hikers in addition to the floor area. I had lunch (dehydrated black beans & rice, dehydrated green peas and dehydrated macaroni, all combined in the same baggy with seasoning mixed in. I let the food soak for about 10 minutes and put the heat to it using my alcohol stove and my evernew .6 L pot with windscreen. I had a cup of hot chocolate I made using my esbit stove to boil the water in my 1.5 titanium cup. The pot with windscreen worked well for the windy conditions. because time was getting away from me and I had not planned to spend the night out and I didnât have a head lamp, I packed up and left the shelter at 1:40 PM. I didnât want to let night fall catch up to me (since it gets dark by 5:00 PM and in the backcountry it can seem to get darker earlier). I made the 5 mile hike back to the car at Pen-Mar Park and arrived at 3:30 PM (yes, I was moving a little faster than normal trying to make sure I beat the darkness). The hike was good and I determined that the cook/kitchen set I will use for my 2017 AT Thru-hike will be the set up i used on this hike. The North Face shoes held up very good and performed well on the soft trail, thru the rocky area and the rock scrambling ascent up Quirauk Mountain. I did discover that I will have to replace the Dr Schollâs orthodontic inserts. They did not provide the same comfort and support they did when they were new (they are 6 months old and have over 800 miles on them). The orthodontics are the ones where you can go into a drug store and stand on the Dr. Schollâs machine and the computer determines where you need support for your foot and arch area and determines the exact orthodontics for you. I need the CF 240. Iâll change those out very soon. happy Veterans Day from the Viet Nam Vet. SEMPER FI","Pen-Mar County Park, MD

The climb up out of there was long and steep. When I got to the ridge, it was smooth going for about 4 1/2 miles (except for one small rock area). I stopped for snack break at Pogo Campground (near the Thurston Grigs trail) I met several young teenage people along the way Who were out walking, none of them had water or any type of backpack or Fannypack's to carry snacks in. I asked where were they headed and how far are they going without water or food in the back country here. They said oh we're just out walking. So I just told them when they come out here they should at least have some water, at least one person have a small first aid kit and everybody should have some type of snacks in the unlikely event someone gets hurt or they get stranded. I also advised him that the nearest road in the direction they were going was 4 miles away and that was wolf Ville Road. I told them they may want to consider turning around and going back towards black rock and Annapolis area were there are plenty of people and where they're closer to help should something happen to them. I also advised them that there is no cell service down in this valley where we are. So you can't call on Siri or Google or anyone else if you need some help. Two of them replied we just going a few more minutes and then we're gonna turn around. I said to them OK be safe don't smoke that funny stuff because you might get lost. They didn't respond to that so I figured they were looking for a place were they could get their groove on with the funny smokes (besides, could smell it in the air before they got to m). As I passed Black Rock cliff, I came upon two brothers from Odenton Maryland and they looked at me real strange because I had a backpack on and I looked at them real strange that they didn't have a backpack on so I asked them did something happen on planet Earth since I've been gone? They looked at me really strange then. So I explained to them what I was talking about and we got a good laugh out of it. We talked backpacking a few minutes and then we moved on. I had a conversation with the two of them. I had some good brief conversation with several more people along the way to Pine Knob Shelter. I made it to Pineknob shelter got my water from the piped spring and I prepared my food. There was a scoutmaster and a den mother with a young kid of about 10 years old that they were teaching him how to use the bear pole for hanging food and setting up his tent in the tenting area. They were gracious enough to give me two granny apples that were big and delicious. I had those for dessert after my dinner. I climbed into my sleeping bag about 7:30 pm tired and exhausted and all I wanted was sleep. I think I got maybe two hours of sleep. From the time I got in my sleeping bag, until I got up at five in the morning. The highway traffic on interstate 70 was just out right loud it was very noisy. I put my ear pods in to listen to music from my iPod and the highway traffic literally drowned out my music. When I got up at 5 AM I started packing up my stuff made my breakfast and hit the trail by 730 I will start and I knew it was gonna be a long day.","Ensign Cowall Shelter

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554991,"Monday February 20, 2017 I hiked 12 miles from Pine Knob Shelter to Crampton Gap Shelter. My hike started out slow because I was tired and exhausted not getting any sleep the night before and I knew I had multiple 1100 foot climb. There were plenty of people out for the presidents holiday don't they hikes I met several people along the way. Then had conversations with them and moved on. Then I had the gnarly climb up to Boonsboro Mountain Road. Then I had the next gnarly climb up into Washington monument state park the monument was closed at the time I got there. It's a park ranger was going up to open it since people were starting to come into the park. I took a 15 minute break there in the park ate some snacks got some water and some electrolytes in to my system, I was starting to sweat a lot from the steep rocky climbs. After the steep rocky dissent from Boonsboro into Dahlgren backpacking camp ground I took another break and had snacks and water and electrolytes. I loaded up on peanut butter Ritz crackers and cheese and pepperoni because I knew I had a steep climb up lambs know about 1000 foot climb and a rocky one at that. I met a Potomac Appalachian trail club Trail maintainer we talked for a few minutes before I ascended the last 300 feet. The trail maintainer was cutting up blow downs and reworking the water bars. Yes, you guessed it right I stop for another break at the top of Lambs Knoll. I then moved on and continued along the ridge, the very Rocky Ridge. I made it to White Rocks View and took a water and electrolyte break. I also had some dark chocolate candy. After my break, I hiked on to Crampton Gap shelter. I had a few small climbs along the way but nothing major. I met a few more people along the way and I eventually made it to Crampton Gap shelter. I got to the shelter and someone's gear was already there, they laid out there sleeping bag and pad and their external frame pack was hanging from one of the wall pegs. I was there about 15 or 20 minutes before someone showed up. By that time, I had already set up my sleeping area and was about to start cooking my food when the other camper came to the shelter. I found out his Trail name is ""Slider"" and he's from Baltimore. Slider got his trail name from his 1996 through hike. While in the Smokies, his buddies always looking to see if he was keeping up. But they would always see him slipping and sliding on the snow and ice. So, they named him ""Slider"". Slider said he was only out for a few days and his truck was parked at Gatlin state park. He said he was just back from a food and beer run in the little town 8 miles away. Slider brought back some hot Italian sausage, beer and, ginger rail. Oh yeah, and some vodka and chip. He said he was going to be hunkered down there for two more days before moving on. I had two of the hot Italian sausages we cooked over the fire pit. I cut them up and put them into my ramen noodles along with the pepperoni slices and two spoons of peanut butter and a piece of Cracker Barrel sharp cheddar cheese. Damn that was a tasty and feeling meal. I was tired from the long hiking day with just a few hours sleep, but it was very interesting listening to slider and his stories. We stayed up drinking beer and telling stories until about 11 o'clock (and that's way past hikers curfew time). We had a good fire going and we were just talking away. Finally, I got into my sleeping bag and fell asleep for about 20 minutes when I was awakened by what sounded like a bear at the entrance to the shelter. I could only think there was a bear outside the front of the shelter. I sat up , grabbed bear spray (took the safety off) and grabbed my headlamp. I turned the headlamp on with the bear spray pointed towards the Shelter entrance and darkness. There was nothing there, no bear to be seen or heard. The noise was from Slider snoring. So all I could think about was here we go again, another night with no sleep. So I put my earbuds in to listen to my music on the iPod and his snoring drowned out the music. Finally, I turn the music on the iPod way up and pulled the plug out so the music wasn't coming through the ear buds but it was just blasting into the shelter. Slider jumps up and hears the song Benny and the Jets and he starts singing right along with the music LOL. I said well since I can't sleep he wont either. Slider stayed up and listen to Elton John for three more songs, Benny and the Jets was one, Daniel my brother is the other and a candle in the night. He knows the words to all three of them. Well after that he went back to sleep and did not snore anymore that night. I finally got to go back to sleep and this is about 2 o'clock 2:30 in the morning. I got up at 5:30 AM started packing up my stuff, got my breakfast cooked Slider was making coffee and he shared his coffee with me, so that was one less thing I didn't have to do. We can talk while we ate. He seemed amazed that I had Elton John music. He said he thought he was dreaming when heard Benny and the Jets. I said no, I turn it up loud so I wouldn't hear your snoring anymore. We both started laughing out loud. But we had a good time laughing about it. Finally we said our goodbyes and I got going to make the 12 mile hike to Harpers Ferry and hunker down there for the night. He said he was going to stay there at the shelter for another day and then move on. I had a great time talking with Slider many different subjects. He's an avid reader and he had 4 hardback books with him to read.","Cramton Gap Shelter

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554993,"Tuesday February 21, 2017 hiked 12 mile to ATC HQ in Harper's Ferry, WVA. After another sleepless night I got up and headed out for Harpers Ferry. I have to remember to take my ear plugs with me. Why I keep forgetting them I have no clue. The hike started out slow but I gradually picked up my pace. No major climbs just some little small climbs. Did not see many people on the trail today just one or two joggers with their dogs. I stop at Gatland State Park and refreshed my water with fresh drinking water from the well pump. Today's hike was somewhat uneventful and it gave me a lot of time to think and figure out a lot of things about the way I want to do this 2017 through hike. So I had a lot of hiking time to think about a plan, to reminisce about lessons learned during my last thru-hike attempt, and things that I would change or not change. I had time to reflect back on some of the many conversations I had with people over the past couple days and how amazing it is to hear their stories and see the genuineness of their stories. Also the courtesy and respect that people gave you and how they admire what you are doing and wishing they could do it. And most all mention having time to do things because they can't retire now or their retirement date is so far off and they are afraid that by then they may not be in good physical shape to do it. But there are a lot of people that I've met on the trail that really admire Appalachian trail through hiker type of people and, they love sharing their thoughts about them themselves one day attempting it. I stopped at the Ed Garvey shelter and had a snack break and water break and electrolytes. I took about 15 minutes there before heading out again. And shortly after leaving Garvey shelter, I ran into a young lady named Patty Baker she says she does some type of trailer angel stuff alone that section of the trail between Harpers Ferry and Crampton Gap and she also goes out and clean the trail when she's out running with her dog. We talked about hiking gear and she asked about my pack and how I liked it. She is thinking about getting the Ark Haul pack made by Z pack. I told her my pack is a ULA Circuit made by ultralight associate and it's a 62 L. I told her the pros and cons about the pack and that I plan to switch out my pack for a Z pack model. I explained to her how it ( the ULA Circuit) rubs the lower portion of my back and it holds the sweat so your back is constantly wet. We talked for about 10 minutes maybe 15 and then she went on to continue her run up the trail and I continued my hike south. I met a guy from Ohio just when he was cresting the hill coming from Weaverton, he asked me if he had finally gotten to the top of the mountain. I told him yes he was finally at the top. He looked so relieved to hear that. So we talked for about five minutes maybe 10 minutes because he was resting. he's A lil portly guy but his T-shirt said I am doing the entire Appalachian trail in very small sections One at a time. That shirt said it all and I'm proud of him for getting out and doing it his way. I told him just that and he smiled and said thanks for the confidence. Well I made the dissent off the mountain which was very tricky and Rocky and wares out your knees. I saw a group of fourth or fifth graders with their two chaperones they were coming up the mountain. All of them look like they were having fun except one and they look like ""why am I out here climbing up a dirt and Rocky Mountain? I spoke to them and they all replied hello. I continued down the mountain and got to the dreaded portion of this Maryland section and that is the 2 mile stretch on the C & O Canal Tow path. The 2 mile stretch on the C & O canal is the most boring section. It's hard on your feet walking on that hard surface for 2 miles. Especially after stepping on rocks in tree roots all day long. I made it in the Harpers Ferry. I went to a bar grill and got a turkey Panini sandwich with coleslaw and potato chips put it in my pack and walked up to the ATC where I ate my sandwich and talk to Laurie, it was nice seeing her again and talking with her. It's always nice it's always nice seeing the people that works in the ATC. That's a great place and they do a great service to all hikers. Well I had my 2017 picture taken and I forgot to get my 2017 thru hiker tag. I'll get that tomorrow. I walked from the ATC headquarters down to the Tea Horse Hostel where I met with Laurel, who checked me into the hostel. I read the house rules. She's very friendly and I'm glad I called to stay here. I'm the only hiker here for tonight so that's great. I have nobody to snore and wake me up. The hostel is very very clean smells good and looks good and the bed feels good. If you're in Harpers Ferry come to the Tea Horse hostile, it's a very nice place. The cost is $35 and you have a full bathroom, there are two full bathrooms in this house. Fresh linen clean towels really really nice. There is a very nice sitting area and with two dinner style tables, one room has the capacity to sleep four the other room has the capacity to sleep 10. Very very nice place really really nice. It's nice to have the whole place to yourself and I had a really really nice hot shower got the shampoo my hair or my head because there's not much hair on it LOL. I am really really glad I picked this hostel to stay for the night. OK it's getting close to hiker curfew time. So I will say good night and enjoy your life, do the things you want to do, do the things you like to do and, let no one hold you back Semper Fi ""Viet Nam Vet""","Crampton Gap Shelter

Along the way, I stopped at Hawk Mountain Shelter for a snack break at 10:45 where, I met Jay from Alabama and Joel from Texas they were solo hiking and met on trail and decided to hike together since they hike at same pace. We had a good conversation in reference to the trail. I had my snack and was able to give them information on PA that they asked about. I moved on to Gooch Mountain climbing up and over 4 mountains to include sassafras mountain. I passed a lot of people along the way and some people passed me along. I stopped at Woody gap and had lunch. I climbed Sassafras Mountain. I stopped at Preaching Rock and had a beautiful view of Atlanta and stone mountain from there . I was enjoying the view and a quite moment thinking of a friend (former MPD Motorman TJ who also worked with me) who's in the hospital recovering in rehabilitation from a heat attack.

The temperature was about 30 degrees with a slight breeze. I made my breakfast and broke down camp and head northbound on the AT. I got to Lance Creek campground where I ran into ""Purple Pony"". Purple Pony and I hike for the remainder of the day up and down ""cedar mountain"" that we thought was Blood mountains only to get our bubble burst when two south bounders told us otherwise. It was a brutal climb up and down cedar mountain. It was a terrible weather with sleet and snow mixed. Purple Pony and I cleared cedar mountain and continued into the mountains of the Blood Mountain Wilderness. There we began the 2,500 foot climb to the summit of Blood Mountain. There were many false summits along the way (finally we check the data book for the correct elevation). Yes, we had to climb to the 4,656 foot mark to be at the summit. The sleet and snow fell on us as we made the climb one step at a time (especially in the rocky sections and were there were rock steps to climb). Snow from the trees dropped down on us as the winds blew. The fog was very thick and just standing still. Several other thru-hikers passed us (the younger crowd lol) as we ascended the mountain. Before reaching the Blood Mountain Shelter, I lost my skull cap. When I realize it was gone, I stopped and looked around. I the walked back down the trail a little ways but did not see the hat. When purple Pony and I got to the Shelter, Middle East family out for a day hiking gave us bottled water and volunteered to pack out our trash. Yes, we gave them our trash and recycling stuff. We let them know how appreciative we were of their good will and kindness. Shortly thereafter, two hikers I met at stover creek Shelter (Jess from Boston and Chelsea from va) found my hat and was going to carry it to Blood Mountain Shelter but they came across me and Purple Pony before reaching the Shelter. Jess remembered seeing me wearing the hat. Wow, how lucky I was on that one. At the summit of Blood Mountain the foggy conditions did not allow for viewing anywhere at the many viewing spots. No view to be seen today. Well, we (Purple Pony and I) started the brutal rocky decent off Blood Mountain. It was still sleeting mixed with rain and the terrain was slick, wet and muddy. The rocks were slick and slippery. Multiple times I nearly lost my footing but I averted a disastrous fall. At one point coming down the trail, we came to a fork junction and had to decide which way to go. There were no trail blazes in sight so we decided to go right. That was the best choice because shortly thereafter we came upon a white blaze. Well, we continued down the mountain only taking a short break because we were just tired and beat up from all the rocks, mud and sleet. Finally, we reached the bottom and the road crossings onto the property of Mountain Crossings outfitters. I ran into several other thru-hiker I had met several days before. I also met up with my friend Mark who will be hosting me at his mountain home in Blue Ridge, GA. Well, I picked up my re-supply box and a piece of equipment shipped from ZPacks and loaded up in Marks jeep and off to his house. Wow that's all I can say about the view of the mountains from the living room area of the house. The view is breathtaking. The evening sunset is just spectacular. You have to see it to believe it.

Got up about 9:00 AM made a call or two then went up to the main floor and said my good morning greetings to Mark & Debby. We had breakfast together which was absolutely great (sausage,eggs, biscuits coffee). Mark invited me along for a ride to run his errands and I got a chance to go to the trail outfitters. I needed a new pair of trousers and was interested in getting a heavier coat due to the up coming below freezing temperatures over the next few days (night time low 17 degrees with 20-25 mph winds day time highs of 25 degrees with snow and wind). I'm heading out for Blairsville tomorrow and will hunker down until the weather turns better in the next day or so. Based on the projections for the next two days, the temperature will be unsafe for me to be sleeping in a tent or shelter. My 19 degrees sleeping bag with liner can't handle temperatures as low as 17 degrees. And, factor into the equation the wind chill with 20 - 25 mph winds, that will be brutal and can be deadly. So, I think the wise thing to do for me is to hunker down indoors until all the deadly weather has passed. It goes to show you that no matter what the weather people try to predict weather wise, only Mother Nature is in charge of the weather. I had followed the 30 day projected weather forecast from Springer Mountain up to the Tennessee state line. The weather was good for hiking, except a few places rain was expected. After getting here to GA and having hiked for several days now, I came to learn that these GA mountain have their own weather system that follow no rules. So, when you come to Ga at Springer Mountain, be prepared for anything weather wise and definitely be prepared to put your hiking plans on HOLD until it's safe to be out there over night. Good night.

The temperature is 21 degrees with a wind of 14 mph causing a windchill of 10 degrees (now that's brutal). However, the sun is shining with clear skies. I got up at 8:00am and walked to the local breakfast restaurant named ""Hole-in-the Wall"". Upon entering I immediately felt transformed back to the days of the old diners with red and white checkered table covering and metal chair with red cushions. There were booths along the wall with metal rimmed table and Formica surfaces. The walls decorated with small squared canvas paintings of two and three lines of words of wisdom and sarcasm. Very quiet quaint place. The folded Xerox paper menu listing breakfast and lunch items in black and white print with meal prices written in by hand. The wait staff were quick and efficient and very pleasant. They're greeting to everyone was of southern styled ""what can I get for you Honey "", "" You ok Honey "", more coffee honey "" . Yes it was as that kind of a place and I was all good with that. The food was southern style cooking and it was great. I had coffee and the ""Moonshiner breakfast "" ( two over-easy eggs, 3 link sausages, and 2 biscuits smothered in white gravy. The people were friendly and pleasant. I paid my breakfast bill of $7.39 and departed to be transformed back into the millennial years once outside. What a great breakfast experience. Once outside, I was rudely reminded of just how brutal the weather was when the cold freezing wind struck my face and body at about 20 mph. I stepped out into the cold mountain air without zipping up my outer garments and pulling my skull cap over my head and ears. I walked over to the outfitters store but it was closed for the day (closed on Wednesday) ugh that's not good. I need to get fuel for my hiking stove before heading out to the trail on Thursday. I'm now in my room weighing my options for solving that issue. Well, I got that issue solved. I found another bike shop/outfitter they had fuel and electrolytes and, owner gave me some extra electrolytes (Cytomax powdered sports drink) that he had on hand that weren't selling. So, that was a blessing, I now have plenty of electrolytes for the warm hiking temperatures ahead. I ran into the D.C. Hikers I met earlier at Gooch Mountain Shelter, they were heading to the Hole in the Wall restaurant. I also ran into Purple Pony who was out walking about town checking out the boutiques and shops around the town square.

Eight of the 12 of us in the van got out at Hogpen gap and proceeded northbound on the Appalachian trail. Eventually we all started spreading out overtime based on everyone's walking pace. Purple pony and I were the last two in the line of eight people heading up the mountain. We were the slow ones and old ones. All the rest were in their 20s and full of piss and vinegar and running up the mountain. However, at the top of the mountain and where it leveled off we eventually caught up to some of them sitting taking a break, exhausted from the climb and sweating. And, now they're cold from the 20 mile an hour winds up on the top of the mountain. Purple pony and I just kept on moving while they rested. Eventually we traversed several more mountain tops sheet rock top, down into Lowgap shelter where we took a lunch break. After lunch break at Lowgap shelter, we took off went through cold Springs gap, Chattahoochee Gap before making the last climb up to BlueMountain shelter. The climb was about 3,000 over a 3 mile span. At the shelter I was the only one sleeping in the shelter until one lady decided to put her tent in the shelter to get out of the Highwinds her name was Addaleen no trail name yet. The other guy that came along I don't remember his name but he look like a mountain man wearing is buckskins and Davy Crockett hat and Jim buoy knife, no sleeping bag, no pack, he carried everything across his shoulder in a sack. He slept in the shelter with his back on the wall sitting on his butt with his Indian looking blanket wrapped around him. The temperature was 29Â°. I don't know how he did it but he did it. At 6 o'clock in the morning he was roaming around packing his stuff and ate his breakfast at the same time and he was gone up before 7:00 AM.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556772,"3/17/17 Friday miles hiked 7.2 miles. I woke up around 830 made my breakfast packed my pack and headed out northbound from the BlueMountain shelter. On my way out from the BlueMountain shelter I said my goodbyes to Dave, the ATC ridge runner who did an excellent job last night talking about leave no trace to the hikers that were there. It was about 17 to 20 people camped there overnight. David the ridge runner did a great job informing people of things, so kudos to ATC and the ridge runners. I left the shelter and did a slight downhill decent and then made the 500 feet or more climb to the top with blue Mountain. From the top of BlueMountain, the views were beautiful as I descended down to Unicoi gap, which was a 1000 foot decent. Obviously, where there is a 1000 foot decent there is a 1000 foot ascent. Yep, so when I got down to Unicoi gap I had to make the 1000 foot climb up rock mountain. I got to the top of rock mountain and view was beautiful. I made a 1000 foot decent down to Indian grave gap. There were some people there that were out day hiking. I Met several thru-hikers coming down off the mountain going northbound and making the climb up out of Indian gap. So, that's where I took a break. Purple Pony took a break. I had a quick snack. It was real funny watching this one guy in a group of three when he got to the forest service road he took his pack off and threw it as far as he could throw it, Which wasn't very far and he threw his hiking poles and shouted ""I have enough"". So, he was clearly frustrated with that thousand foot up thousand foot down thousand foot up thousand foot down climbing his buddies were laughing at him. Well I left Indian Grave Gap and started my 1500 foot ascent to Trey mountain. When I got to Trey gap and the US Forest Service Rd., #79 and Trey Mountain Road, purple pony said she couldn't take it anymore she couldn't make that lasts six 600 foot climb. She was exhausted and we had about a mile to go to get to the shelter. The weather was changing and getting colder, the rain clouds are moving in. So we contacted trail angel miss Janet to come pick up purple pony. Miss Janet indicated she was an hour or so away but was on her way. Looking at the impending weather and the time of the evening I decided to stay with purple pony until the shuttle got there. I didn't want to leave her alone on the side of a rarely traveled dirt US Forest Service with bad weather moving in along with darkness. By the time the shuttle got to our location, it was too late for me to try to make the mile hike up the mountain and over the other side to the shelter before dark and the rain. I took the shuttle ride to Hiawassee and that's where I'm staying for the night. Trail Angel Miss Janet will pick me up in the morning and take me back to Forest service Road 79 Trey Mountain Road and I'll finish the hike up the mountain to the shelter and continue on to my next destination from there. Purple pony I think is heading home tomorrow. Mentally she is very tough. I think it's more of an equipment issue being uncomfortable and hauling a lot of weight, along with improper equipment. Once she get the equipment issues taken care of, I think she'll be back on trail before you can blink and eye. Let's wish her luck and look forward to seeing her out on the trail again, real soon. Purple pony is a good hiking partner and I'm glad I have had the privilege to hike with her for the couple days I have, and I look forward to seeing her back out on the trail sooner than later.

Also on the shuttle were ""Preacher"", Audidas"" who got off at Neels Gap. The guy ""Peaches"" was just hanging out with Ms Janet. I finally got to my drop off location and then I made the 1,000 foot climb to the top of Tray Mountain. The howling winds were up to 40 mph gusts. The sun was out and it rained slightly off and on. I finally arrived at the Tray Mountain Shelter and there were 3 other hikers already set up in the Shelter. Also, ""Snail Pace"" was there but was camping further down the mountain. I immediately set out my gear to claim a spot. The thru-hiker Chiclet had blisters that needed caring for. He had no idea how to relieve the pressure. Myself, Tortoise and Hodgepodge talked him through it. I gave him the needle and alcohol prep to use.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556983,"3/19/17 Sunday, Hiked 11.6 miles. Yesterday, I got a very late start so I only hiked 2 miles to get up to the top of Trey mountain. At which point, I decided to camp there last night because it was just too cold and Windy with impending rain. Based on that, I decided to stay at the Shelter and not risk making a steep down hill hike to a primitive campsite. If you see my last journal posting, you will know why I arrived so late. Anyway, I got up this morning at Trey mountain and it was about 29Â°, everything was freezing cold. The water in my water bladder was pretty much frozen anyway. I left out of there and started my down hill hike. I started my dissent off of Trey mountain and along the way, I saw several other hikers that were in the Shelter with me. I pass them they passed me. On the descent I went into wolf pen gap, steel trap gap and went over Young Lick Knob and then down into the Sawg-of-the-Blue Ridge. After clearing that hurdle, I went down into the Sassafras Gap where I got water from a puddle. To get to the water, I had to walk a quarter of a mile down a steep hillside. I got down the hillside and found it was just a trickle of water dripping into a puddle from the ground. I left my pack up near the trail once I realize how steep of a down hill hike it was. I got my water and replenished my water bottle. While I was there ""Mile-Back"" and his partner showed up. They went down to get water as well. I told him it's as if someone played a cruel joke on us about getting water. When Mile-Back and his partner got back up to the trail where I was they were really frustrated. They were tired and they could not believe they went all the way down there to a puddle of water. So the three of us just sat there and took a break for about 20 minutes. Eventually they left before me. I was packing up to leave when a lady thru-hiker come through name ""Impramda"", she asked about the water situation. I told her what the situation was and she decided not to go for the water. I also let her know the next water source was 3 miles away and if she had enough water. She said she had enough water to make it. Well, I climbed out of sassafras gap and down into Adidas Gap, where I took another break. I had a piece of chocolate I had a full bottle of electrolyte and I had a Reesie's peanut butter cup. I knew leaving Adidas gap I had a 1000+ foot climb to Kelly's Knob. I knew the climb was going to be a long slow and brutal one. And, I was not disappointed, it was a brutal climb. It got hot from the sun beaming on me. However, I made it to the top of Kelley's knob and the view there was just simply beautiful. I made a video I posted on Facebook for my friend TJ Jones who's in Rehab letting him know every step he takes in rehab for his recovery I'm taking 10 steps for him. Well, I continued on my way and descended-down to Deep Creek Shelter. However, I decided to by pass the Shelter and continued up Powell Mountain. At or near the top of Powell Mountain, I saw my friends Mark & Debby. Since I'll be staying with them tonight, The two came out to hike the last couple of miles with me to Dick's Creek Gap. Wow, what a special group of friends they are, kudos to both of them (love you guys). I was so happy to see Marks jeep that I blurted out ""Halilouyah"". We rode to their home where I took a shower and had a nice cold beer served in a real beer Jug handle type glass. I stared out the large windows at the sun setting behind the multiple layers of the mountain ranges in view. A great view absolutely fabulous view. We sat and had dinner and talked about various things dinner was a sweet potato casserole pork-loin, carrots and lima beans absolutely delicious delicious.

We had a very good home cooked meal of pork loin, Lima beans, sweet potato casserole and grilled pineapple with whipped cream for desert. I must say it was another fabulous meal of many they have treated me to. I got up at 8:00 and packed my pack then went upstairs for breakfast. Mark made me coffee while Debby whipped up some grits, county ham, crusoints and over easy eggs. Wow what a fantastic breakfast to start the morning. After breakfast we loaded up the jeep and headed to Dicks Creek Gap. Once there, we started hiking N/B on the AT. We stopped after about 2-1/2 hours and ate lunch. They hiked with me to the trail junction with the Plumorchard Shelter. At that point, Mark & Debby headed back to Dicks Creek Gap. Wow, it was a pleasure hiking with the two of them again ( great people they are). I took a short break and continued up the mountain. Along the way I met several thru-hikers I had been moving with for the last 3 days. The weather was good and the hiking was great. The climb up the mountains was good and not to grueling even though it was all up hill hiking. I made it to the GA/NC border, a non-discript site with a wooden marker nailed to a tree. Nevertheless, it was a beautiful thing to see. I knew I had made it to NC. I knew I was close to the campsite because I could hear the voices of other people. I got in to camp and set up my Six Moon tent and rehydrated my black beans and rice and made tea. I ate my dinner by the campfire with several other hikers (Immora, Snail Pace, 25 Steps Back and his grandson). I can't remember the other names right now (lol), it'll come to me tomorrow. Also, I got a text message from Mark letting me know he saw Purple Pony at Dicks Gap. He sent me a picture of her at her tent and that she said hi for me.

I made the grueling 1200 foot climb up Albert Mountain and Took a half hour break. Met Jason while taking my break. He was low on water and I offered him my 16 oz bottle. He refused it thinking the next water source was only a few miles away. I met him again at the trickle of a water source and he was having trouble getting it to flow to fill his bottle. So,I pulled a leaf from the overhanging mountain laurel bush and placed it on a flat are were water was moving with the leading edge of the leaf overhanging the rock. The water flowed over the leaf and off it's edge creating a full stream of water flowing. Jason thanked me and continued filling up his bottle. I asked that he passed the water trick on to the next person. I continued on up the trail. I passed through Sassafras Gap and to the Muskrat Shelter where I saw Brice and his friend taking a lunch break. I stopped in and took a half hour snack break and filled up with water, cranked some electrolyte and peanut butter and a breakfast bar. I left the two of them and continued up the trail. I signed the log book at White Stamp and continued on my way to White Oak Gap. I stopped at Chunky Lady Trail and had a snack and then continued on down the mountain to USFS Rd 71 at the Kimsey Creek Trail and camping area. I paused for a moment and spoke with Jason and two other day hikers before starting the 500 foot climb up to Standing Indian Shelter. At about 300 feet into the climb, I took a picture next to the sign letting you know you were now entering the Southern Nantahala Wilderness. I made the final push up the mountain to the Shelter and found only one other thru-hiker there. I was surprised but pleased because there was an impending thunderstorm heading my way. I quickly claimed me a corner spot. The other hiker is ""Five-O"" and he's from Florida. We had a good conversation while we made our dinner. Brice and his friend showed up and claimed themselves a spot. Afterward, Jason and another hiker showed up but they chose to setup their tent and hammock. I'm not sure if they knew of the approaching storm. Well they know now because all hell has broken loose with this storm. High winds, lightning, thunder and a ton of rain is falling right now at 8:30 PM. There is room in the Shelter for them if they decide to come into it. I'll say my day was long and grueling and very hot. I took off my hiking trousers and put on my thin long- John's and hiked in the it was so warm.

I made several calls to arrange my shuttle into Franklin, NC to resupply and take a Zero day to rest my right knee. I made arrangements to meet the shuttle at 12 noon. So, myself and Five-O left camp and hiked up the mountains and down on the other side into Betty Creek Gap (which is also the south entry into the Nantahala Wilderness). Along the way I saw plenty of hikers who were also at the Carter Gap Shelter last night. Five-O and I continued up the trail until we reached USFS Rd 86 /Mooney Gap. Well, the shuttle was way late like an hour late. Due to bad cell service, communication with driver (Zen) was difficult at the least. While waiting at Mooney Gap, several other thru-hikers stopped and chatted (Mile Back, The German, Pacer and two other. Well, the shuttle showed up and we loaded up the car ( not a van or SUV mind you). But, a KIA 5 passenger car. The driver had to pickup 3 more hikers with packs. I was thinking how he was going to do that in this tiny ass tight car with a big ass old and lazy but friendly dog (lol). The hatch back area was filled with three packs already. We, we stopped and picked up Forest (after driving around 15 minutes). Then, Lucky and Gypsy. Gypsy, after we took 2 packs out of the cargo area, sat in the cargo area. I was holding my pack and so was Five-O. I'm really thinking now he can't be charging us the full amount for this shuttle to his hostel ($40 for the two of us Five-O and me). The dog was a cross breed of pit bull and something else and was brown with tiger like black stripes. Yes I was sitting in her seat (front passenger seat) and she wanted to be in it. So, she sat with her upper body on the console and the the rest of her body on the back seat passengers ( kept trying to lick my face and using her big head to nudge and move my head . She was a friendly dog and maybe a little too friendly. The dog weighs about 100 lbs. and every time we hit a curve, her ass leaned into me (squishing me onto the door). What a ride it was. On those curves, her real ass end was in Forests face. By the way, Forest was the main music attraction at the restaurant/Bar named ""The Lazy Hiker Brewery in downtown Franklin. He had a pretty big crowd and the women loved him. He's a cool young version of the 60's hippie type that you would have seen at a Jimmy Hendricks or Grateful Dead concert. He's staying here at the hostel as well ( he's a good friend of Zen the owner) he has a rainbow colored harem style tent. We finally made it to the hostel and got checked in for the day. After seeing the bunkhouse area, I decided on a private room (great choice). The bunks were a little too close to each other and if anyone snores, that's it you're up the rest of the night. After settling in, I went out to dinner at a Mexican restaurant called Mi Casa. I had a Mi Casa Fajita (beef, chicken and Shrimp). The food was great. Oh, on the way to Mi Casa I ran into Snail Pace. I thought he was a day ahead of me but he wasn't. He's staying at the same hostel I at Gooder Grove Guest House in Franklin, NC. Also, Pacer ( bests real talker that you try to get as far away from as possible) is staying here as well. I thought he said he was going to stay at the Budget Inn. I me Sherpa from Germany and Sparrow from Roanoke, Va. Five-O and I ordered a large Dominos meat lover pizza and washed it down with some Jim Beam whiskey on the rocks. Beast the hostel overseer dranked with us but had no pizza. He then joined some other hikers outside at the fire pit (all ill say is there was a lot of smoke in the air with a funny smell. I went inside and had a paint of Rocky Road ice cream and a snickers candy bar and washed it down with a 12 oz Coke. I had a great day of hiking. The weather was good (after the 30 degrees start) and the trail was forgiving and lined with rohadendrems and charmed hardwood trees from a previous forest fire. .

Afterward, I walked up to the ""Outdoor 76"" outfitters store and purchased some protein drink, electrolyte drink and a small fuel canister. When I got to the outfitters store, Sherpa was sitting on the bench outside people watching. I chatted with him for about 10 minutes and then went into the store and made my purchase. I returned outside and sat on the bench. We talked for about a half hour about a wide range of subjects from Wars, various countries, pay & retirement to school systems and discipline issues with students today. While on the topic of schools, he brought up the name of the shuttle van driver ""Short Bus"". I asked what are you trying know about him? He said he was trying to figure out what the different trail names meant and how people come to use them. So I asked, have you ever heard the American phrase ""He rode on the short bus to school? Or ""Oh, he rode the short bus? Well, after I told him about the short bus and it's negative connotations, he fell off the bench onto the ground laughing hysterically. Once he regained his composure, he said ""oh my, I guess I won't be asking him why they call him Short Bus. I agreed with that (lmao).

I Passed through Wayah Gap and made the two mile climb up to the Wayah Bald summit and fire tower. The tower was damaged from last year forest fires. I walked to the top of the tower and the view was magnificent and gorgeous. I departed the mountain top and descended 500 feet thinking the Shelter was close. I was wrong. I had another half mile down hill decent. Well, I made it to the d Shelter just a few minutes after the rain down pouring. The rain most of the day was off and on but no heavy down pours. I nearly fell several times on the decent from stepping on the wet tree roots. I was lucky today. After I got into camp at the Wayah Mountain Shelter, I quickly claimed the last spot in the Shelter. I made my dinner and just cooled out. While talking to another hiker (who I met at the Siler Bald Shelter), she told me about a woman and man couple who ran out of food. I realized who they were and gave them some of my food (one days worth and a few snack bars). I had been hiking with them off and on for a few days. They were very appreciative of my help. They run out of food because the extra day lost to hiking due to bad weather conditions did not allow them to make it to their resupply point. Another hiker gave them each a dinner for today. With that and what I gave them, they have enough food to make it to their resupply point. Several people tried getting a fire going but it was to no avail. The rain just keeps coming about every 20 minutes or so and stops for about 15 minutes. I sat under the canopy of the Shelter talking with Poppa Smurf, Nature Boy, Cashews, Hot Mess and a few others while the rain come and go.

I got up at 7:00 and made my breakfast and filled my water bladder and had a protein drink. I left the Shelter at 9:00 AM an hour later than I wanted to leave. Once I cleared the camping area, I turned left onto the trail and hiked about a half mile up hill. I began to realize I had already passed through that area before. Yes you got it, I was hiking in the wrong direction (damn it). I'm glad it was uphill in the wrong direction than down hill. I eventually got it together and headed in the right direction. After about a two mile trail of easygoing, I hit the first climb at Licklog Gap of about 400 feet. Then up and over the mountain and down into Burningtown Gap. The climb out of the gap to the Cold Spring Shelter was muddy, slippery and wet. The rain was off and on every twenty minutes or so. I made it to the Shelter just in time before the major downpour of rain. The Shelter was nearly full from all the hikers seeking refuge from the rain. I got a spot in the Shelter and changed into my rain gear (rain pants, grocery, grocery store plastic bags for my feet and rain jacket) got back on trail. I continued up the mountain to the view point at Copper Ridge Bald. The rain had stopped briefly to get a picture of the cascading mountain ridges. It was a beautiful view. I left the view point and continued up and down the small mountain ridges. After about a mile, I reached the Rocky Bald view point. The view point was fogged in and there were no visible views. From there it's all down hill into Tellico Gap. The rain came again and made the trail even muddier. It was a grueling, slipping and sliding hike down the mountain. Poppa Smurf who was behind me took a nasty fall on the mud slick trail. The positive thing is that he was not hurt (just his ego was bruised). I was moving super slow. I passed two other hikers, one was a woman who took a nasty fall and injured her knee. It was a steep, grueling white knuckles climb off the mountain. As I got closer to the bottom and could see the fire road, I was never so happy. I could also hear music and lots of people having fun. Once I cleared the trail and got onto the fire road, I instantly realized it was Trail Magic being served. I was so happy I could've cried. I was tired, hungry, nerves shot from the down hill decent and all muddy. I was welcome by the two men who made it all happen and the hikers that got there ahead of me. I had to Hot Dogs, cookies, salami wrapped around cheese, a beer, Cheetos and a host of other goodies. This was also my pick up point by the shuttle driver who would take me and Poppa Smurf to the Nantahala Lodge. The driver showed up after about a half hour and I thanked the people for the Trail Magic and left. When I got there last year we went into the mud room and put our packs and they're in our shoes. We were given a laundry bag took a shower put the dirty clothes in the laundry bag make it was close to where. We sat around for about a half hour and then we had dinner served. Dinner was mashed potatoes, meatloaf with gravy broccoli and Collie flower, water and Gatorade. Dessert was apple pie with whipped cream. We had a salad also. The food was great. I'm sitting on the sun porch listening to the rain downpour and the lightning outside. Fat Boy and Ginger just came in from Franklin, NC where they picked up their new hiking shoes.

The weather was cool and foggy but changed to warm and balmy and partly sunny. The temperature was 65 degrees. I got dropped off at Tellico Gap by the shuttle driver. The view looking north was good but not great due to the low cloud ceiling. However, I could see the southern end of the Smoky Mountains of which I took a picture. I made the 700 foot climb to the top of the Wesser Bald Mountain. There was no good views because of the fog. I continued down the mountain to the Wester Bald shelter where I had a snack break and met A through hiker from South Carolina, we talked for a few minutes and he continued on. After my snack, I continued down the mountain into what can be described as a dip. Because you went right back up hill again, Where the mountain went like a roller coaster up-and-down short hills. Shortly after that, I reached a point called ""The Jump Off"". The views from there were absolutely gorgeous. They could have been better had it not been for the low cloud ceiling. But it was that type of view that makes it all worth the hard work it takes to climb these mountains. I sat there for about twenty minutes just gazing out over the mountains and valleys. My thoughts were all over the place from my time in the Marines and Viet Nam and to now sitting on a rock with my feet dangling over the abyss (at least a 1,000 feet below me) in North Carolina on the Appalachian Trail. What a powerful feeling and emotional high. It was like a healing of the mind and soul from years of suppressed memories. My moment of solitude was interrupted by a passing thru-hiker. From my precarious position, I got up and gathered my thoughts. I started the descent of 1,500 feet that would cover over three miles to the bottom and the Nantahala Outdoor Center. A mile after leaving the jump off point, I came upon Five-O who was taking a break. We talked for a few minutes about were he disappeared to and that several other hikers were concerned about him when he didn't show up at the Wayah Bald Shelter. Everyone was concerned because we all knew he was having knee issues. He indicated he just pushed on to the next Shelter. I hiked with him for a few minutes and could tell his knee was still bothering him. I pushed on to the A. Rufus Morgan Shelter and the last campsite. There, I saw Mike (the Fed Agent) and his brother -in-law setting up their tents and camp for the night. We talked for a few minutes and I continued up the trail for the last mile to the NOC where my shuttle was waiting. Before getting into the shuttle, I went into the NOC General store and got a pop tart and gator aid for the ride back to the lodge. Once at the lodge, I changed clothes and showered. At 5:30 on the nose, dinner was ready. Dinner was noodles soup, baked chicken breast, broccoli and carrots, and sweet potatoes. Desert was chocolate cake with white icing. Dinner was delicious. After dinner, me and Popa Smurf, Ginger and Fat Boy talked about our day and other hikers and things. I had a great day on the Appalachian Trail today. I have a 13 mile day ahead of me tomorrow. Good night Viet Nam Vet","Tellico Gap

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558198,"3/29/17 Wednesday hiked 13.4 miles. I got dropped off at the Geo gap parking area. At the parking area, there was a lady handing out trail magic to the hikers coming off the mountain. I was full and could not eat anymore so, I did not except anything. I later found out that her husband Big Jim's Walking was on the trail coming in my direction. I later met him about two miles into my hike. We talked for a few minutes and moved on. Where I started my hike up the mountain on the switchbacks. The first climb was about 500 feet and sort of sleep and then it leveled off into a gradual climb. On my way up the mountain I passed by Snail Pace and a few other hikers I had been either trailing or moving with over the last few days. I made it to the place I had planned to take a break and eat a snack (Simp Gap). While having my snack, several hikers passed through, some stopping for water and a short break while others kept on moving. I saw (I heard his voice first lol) Chiclets coming down the trail with The Professor. They both stopped and called out to me. I acknowledged their presence. Chicklets came over to were I was sitting and began a conversation. The ""The Professor "" moved on after a short break. I asked Chicklets about his blistering and he said they were doing well since we last saw each other at Tray Mountain. He thanked me again for my help on that. After a while, we moved on. I made the climb up and over the mountain to to Locust Grove Gap where I got water and continued up the next mountain towards Cheoah Bald. The climb up was a brutal unrelenting steep and sometimes rough and rocky climb with the sun beaming down on me forever (felt like I had lost ten pounds on that climb). I met many hikers that were on their down the mountain. I sat for a half hour and ate a snack enjoying the beauty my eyes had the pleasure of taking in. I took off my trail shoes and socks and just relaxed sitting on a log. I felt like I was on top of the world. I had the whole Cheoah Bald to myself, no one else was there. Wow, what a feeling of peace and serenity. I let loose of all my worries and woes and just let my mind wander. I thought about all the Viet Nam warriors (who are gone and those who are unable to be here) who were not here to share in this wonderful moment and, wished they could be here to see what they and I had sacrificed for this country. Powerful, so very powerful. I thought about all my brothers and sisters in Blue who gave their lives in the line of duty to protect the weak and the meek in our society that couldn't be here for this awe inspiring moment. Oh god how I feel so lucky and blessed to be here to represent on behalf of my family of Veterans and Law Enforcement Officers who have sacrificed so much for others. I thought back to my MPDC days when I attached a sticker on the back of my motorcycle/riot helmet (even though it was against MPDC policy) that read "" For Those who fought for it, FREEDOM has a flavor the PROTECTED will never know"". As a part of that, there was the POW/MIA symbol. I can still (to this day) vividly remember an MPD/SOD/SEB Lieutenant in June 1988 telling me to remove the sticker. I out right refused, knowing I could be disciplined for refusing. (the same Lieutenant that tried to write me up for disciplinary action by the Police Trial Board in October 1986) I didn't care then nor now. My response to him and his order was simple and direct. I replied with ""those words you see and read have more power than your ranking of Lieutenant and in fact, you are enjoying your freedom today because of warriors like me"". I then turned and walked away. That was the first and last time anyone on the MPDC challenged me on the issue. The top of Cheoah Bald was spectacular and indescribable. Simply beautiful and awe inspiring. Just as I was leaving, I met Montana who heading N/B. The two of us talked for a moment and moved on. I descended the Bald thinking wow what a view and wishing I could stay longer. I continued down the mountain to the Sassafras Mountain Shelter where I got water. I saw Mike & Dave who were setting up their tents for the night. We talked for a few minutes about their ascent from NOC to the Shelter and they wished they had Slacked Packed the climb. I also had a brief conversation with Sparky and Bushy (husband and wife retired from the USAF). I spoke with several other hikers who were at the Shelter that I had been moving along the trail with for the last several days. Finally, I was back on the trail making the climb up the back side of Sassafras Mountain. I can honestly tell you, it was a brutal butt kicking. The weather being hot with the sun shining on me didn't help. I think GA and NC got together and named the mountains and designed the trail to teach hikers a lesson. What the lessons are, I don't know but never ever want to see another Sassafras anything anymore. I got to the top of Sassafras and took off my pack and laid out on the bare ground. I felt like I had been kicked by a team of mules, dragged by a buffalo at full gallop and slung around like a wet rag in the vortex of a cyclone. Yes, Sassafras kick my ass. I think I laid there for at least a half hour. Eventually, I got it together and headed down Sassafras hoping never to see another Sassafras of any kind again. A third of the way down I reached the viewing point of ""The Jump Up"". The view of the Nantahala Gorge was beautiful to see. I continued down and stopped to get water and met some hikers who stayed at the Gooder Grove Hostel with me. They had two Siberian huskies that greeted me and I played with them for a few minutes. The huskies were full of energy and fun to play with. I talked with the owners and the other hikers for a few minutes and continued on (you just love the people and their dogs and the comraderie the trail brings out of people. Further down the trail I came upon the Memorial Plaque for USFS Ranger Wade Sutton who sacrificed his life protecting the Appalachian Trail during a forest fire in 1968. I stopped for a few minutes to pray for his family and pay homage to his sacrifice. I continued down the last two miles passing through Grassy Gap and Wright Gap respectively. I made it to the railroad tracks crossing and into the NOC restaurant and bar where Poppa Smurf was dining. I sat down and ordered the hikers special two paddy quarter pound beef burger with pepper jack cheese, county bacon, lettuce and tomatoes (yes, it had two big quarter pounds burgers on it. I had huge French fries, a Yengling dark stout beer and a St. Louis ginger-ale (half Coke & half sprite). Popa Smurf and I talked while eating and waiting on our shuttle driver Steve to pick us up. I finished my meal just as he arrived. We got back to the Nantahala Mountain Lodge and I got cleaned up and relaxed with a cup of vanilla spice flavored tea. Well it's past hikers midnight so on that note, Good Night Viet Nam Vet","Cheoah Gap

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558574,"4/1/17 hiked 6.5 miles to Fontana Dam/Fontana Crossings. I got to the Fontana Crossings at 12:30 am. The Fontana Resorts Lodge shuttle van pick me and Popa Smurf up and transported us to the Resort. I was happy to see the shuttle van because my right knee IT ban flared up again. It was somewhat painful on the two mile down hill hike to the shuttle pickup point. After getting settled into my room and getting cleaned up, I iced it down and elevated my leg for about a half hour. Afterward, Popa Smurf and I went to the bar & grill to eat. We Sat and ate, I had a cheese burger with onion rings and a beer. Later, I went to the General store and sat on the porch and had a beer or two with Neapolitan, Bisquit, Lucky, Sparrow, Terridackle and a woman with no trail name yet. After a few brews, I made it up the hill to my room with a view. Well, I took a brief nap and sorted through my gear (why?, I don't know why). After a while, I went to the Wild Wood Bar & Grill and had a chicken cassadia and a Yengling beer. I left the restaurant section and went into the bar where I was greeted by the crew from earlier at the General store. You got it right, I sat down with the crew and had a few more brews. Yes we got a little loud and laughing even harder with each and every trail mishap story. I had a great time and then they closed the bar on us. Oh well, it was a great time while it lasted. We all walked up the hill to our rooms saying good night to all. I got in my room and into bed and watched the last two minutes of the NCAA games (Gonzaga beating SC and NC beating Oregon). Both games were nail biters to the end. After that, I went off into la la land for the night. I had a great day on the Appalachian Trail in North Carolina today. The weather was great, the people were super and the hiking was tuff but better than being at work somewhere ??????. I'll be getting off trail soon so I can return home for my scheduled surgery on April 12th. I'll miss the hiking and great trail people and family. But it's only for a short while and I will be back on trail. Good nite Viet Nam Vet","Cable Gap Shelter

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558856,"4/2/17 hiked (Zero day). Taking the day off at Fontana dam resort. I'm going to rest my knee and hope it gets better with rest. Papa Smurf and I both are suffering with Knee injuries. His knee injuries more severe than mine. At Fontana Village resort, I just rested most of the day & hung out with some of the other through hikers. I ran into a 2016 thru-hiker I met in NY name ""Hail"". His new trail name for 2017 is ""Fifty-Cent"". We talked for a few minutes and I introduced him to the other hikers I was with. The other hikers then realized that I had in fact done a great portion of the trail last year. I Had lunch at the wild wood bar restaurant that's located on the premises. Drink a few beers later that evening had some great conversation with the other hikers. Eventually, made it to my room got cleaned up and hit the bed for the night. Today was a good day in Fontana Village. Had lots of fun, however my knee still bothers me a little bit. I'm ending my hiking here in Fontana Dam. Now, I have to figure out transportation from Fontana to home. There is no transportation hub in Gatlinburg Tennessee and not sure if I can make it to Gatlinburg due to the impending storms coming in tonight and tomorrow through Wednesday. For Fontana dam they're calling for severe storms Sunday night through Tuesday, In Franklin NC, they're calling for snow. The smoky mountains, based on the Appalachian trail weather, is calling for freezing rain and possibility of snow. Not good weather to be trying to get through the smoky mountains. The last thing I need is to get stranded in the Smoky Mountain by bad weather and be delayed reaching a destination where I can get reliable transportation out of the area to get home. I think I will have to figure out my next move over the next 24 hours. I have learned that transportation from Fontana and from Gatlinburg is very difficult to obtain. Oh well, I'll have to work something out. Papa Smurf is also trying to get off trail and we both need to get to a major transportation hub to get home. So, we will put our heads together and figure out how to get to a major transportation hub from Fontana dam. Tomorrow is another day and I'll figure out my next step then.

I had my surgery to replace my lower right mandible (jaw) with a flap (skin and bone grafting and a blood vessel). I left the ICU on on and am now in a regular shared room. The surgery went well so says the doctor. There is still lots of swelling but it's going down. I'm comfortable and no major issues or pain. I haven't had much pain medicine because I'm not in any constant pain. The physical therapist came by and asked a lot of questions. She then had me walking by using a walker. I'm sitting up in the chair next to the window. I can't see much of anything other than the hospital walls. Well that's all for now. I'll see you back on the trail in June. Viet Nam Vet,"None

No wild animals to see that's a good thing. I saw some blooming flowers and little small critters. Nice long rocky trail as usual what can be expected for Pennsylvania.

They are only out for a few days and today is the last camping day for them. I got an emergency flash flood warning on my phone for this location. Glad this shelter is on high ground. The camping group had to come up to the shelter due to the lightning and heavy rain. They were afraid of ground strikes where the lightning hits close by and traveling via the ground to their tents. The lightning was definitely intense and I understand why they were concerned. Another hiker name Evac showed up in the middle of the storm. I met him in NY just before entering Connecticut.

The loud noise woke everyone up when we were out for little while. I was never really able to get any good sleep because the rain hitting the 10 roof on the shelter sounded like somebody will just plan at 10 can draw and all night long so I didn't get very much sleep. Got up at five start packing my stuff up and I was gone by seven. I hiked into the town Salisbury Connecticut and got me a breakfast sandwich. I went to the post office first then I got breakfast sandwich. Â While I was eating my sandwich, I saw several other hikers come out of the grocery store and one told me he brought my clothes line I had forgotten. It's a real thin string on a carabiner we use it for a clothesline last night. So I was glad to he remembered it was my rope with the carabiner. Left out of Salisbury and took shortcut through the cemetery to get back on trail. I stopped and I guess that breakfast sandwich got to me so I laid down on the bench Next to the shed and took a half hour nap. I Â probably needed a nap because I was tired from last night. After I left the Salisbury St Mary Cemetery I hit the 1500 mile mark and I just kept hiking. I went up the mountain and there's some beautiful views on top of Lions Head mountain.

So, I stayed at the Riga shelter. Glad I did no one's here but me right now good and it's got a gorgeous view from the Shelton looking out into the valley and area where you see two lakes they call them twin Lakes. The sun is setting behind me so I can't see it but I take it that in the morning I'll see the sunrise straight out the front of the shelter that's got to be beautiful. Well I made my dinner Ramen noodles mixed with beef bits, peas, carrots, corn and summer sausage and cheddar jack cheese. I'm washing it down with my Way protein drink. Bluebird and rocket just stop then we chatted for a few minutes and they went back down to where they were tenting. The tent sites are behind the shelter down the hill but they don't have the gorgeous view. Today went well my leg is holding out no real issues with it the weather is just stifling hot we got to stop frequently to just cool down then and hydrate. I stopped out in the creek and literally took a bath and wash my clothes at the same time LOL. I climbed over two mountains today and both of them were just out right rugged and the last one going up to the lions head look out was brutal it was rocks and I literally was crawling up the rocks handover hand. I hate that the heat did not help much. But the view was absolutely stunning. I made it up then down the other side to the shelter.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575070,"August 4, 2017 made it to the hemlocks shelter in the pouring rain. Came from the Rica shelter approximately 10 miles away. After I got to the shelter and secured my sleeping area within the shelter. A young kid came in from out of the rain soaking wet and cold his name was Drew. I immediately got a fire going stripping the park off of a Birch tree to use as a firestarter along with a lot of wet wood chips and twigs. I got the fire going (even though everything was wet from the rain) and I strong a clothesline so he could hang his clothes to try at the fire. He was very appreciative of it. Later three other hikers showed up one named Johnny, one name Vinny and one name Sharif. They are Former college classmates from 10 years or and they reunited to do a hike for the weekend. They came into the shelter area and was very happy to see the fire. They were jumping and yelling ""thank goodness we were hoping it would be a fire but we didn't think it would be because of the rain"". They congratulated me thank me and gave me praise for having a fire and they use the fire to warm them self up and dry out their wet clothes also. During the night they stayed up until around 130 in the morning. I had a lot of fun with them up until midnight and I went to bed. They had plenty to drink and plenty to eat we had a great time and listening to different music that Johnny had one his iPad. While we set around the fire that young kid Drew indicated he had blisters on his feet. I helped him to treat his blisters and put mole skin on them. I gave him the necessary items to protect the blisters and to keep them from getting infected. I also instructed him on how to care for them going forward. He had no idea how to burst a blister on his foot. I showed him and taught him how to cleaned his blisters and the area around them. I Gave him a few items to take with them to treat the blisters. The next morning he left around 5:30 AM but left a note on the table at the shelter for me. The note was very touching, he said ""thank you Viet Nam Vet for your service to your country and to us and thank you for the awesome fire and the medical advice and supplies, will see you up the trail"" and he signed the letter Drew. When the other three guys got up I showed them the letter and they all thought it was very touching and very sincere. They were there when I was treating the kids foot and gave him the medical supplies. While I think about it I'm glad I was able to help him and pass on some valuable knowledge to the young kid. I am sure he will remember this for the rest of his life. I know I will. The other three guys along with the young kid I taught them how to build a fire under those wet conditions in the Northeast. Especially where you have a lot of birch trees. I showed them how to strip the top layer of bark from the birch tree and to only take the bark that was already peeling and take it from various parts of the tree and not try to strip the tree of Â secondary layer of bark. Basically I wanted them to know only take the top layer of bark that's peeling from the tree and not the bottom layer. It's Â like in dermatology, you have two layers of skin. They are the dermis and epidermis layers of skin (only take the dermis/ top layer that's peeling from the tree.Â I left the shelter after breakfast and headed for Sheffield, MA to stay at a private home hostel.","Riga Shelter

I stopped at the roadside stand had lunch it's next to the cowpasture I'm walking across now but I went up and over bear mountain and ran into PO who I saw back in Virginia and he asked about my leg and how it doing. I had lunch with three other hikers I can't remember the names right now but we've been traveling and leap frogging with each other all day. I'm headed to upper Goosepond for the night about another 7 miles away weather's been holding up good I ran into some other hikers I knew just can't remember their names right now. I ran into music man, he was going southbound slack packing this morning aboutÂ 11 o'clock at Jerusalem RoadÂ where I took a short break (about 4 miles back). I have come onto a style and I got to go over the fence (A style is a wooden stairs that go up and over a fence usually in a cowpasture). I Continue my hike and made it to the Upper Goose Pond shelter. I had dinner with Sir Poops-A lot, teradactle, Stack and Cotton Hand. We laugh and talked for awhile aboutÂ Washington DCÂ and all the changes. Sir-Poop-alot worked there with the social service. And we laughed about his first year working there and how they always sent him to the hood areas. He talked about how he loved going to Horris & Dickies to get his fish sandwiches. I covered 14 1/2 mile not too bad but that was one brutal climb. Got past that when I got to be cabin upper Goose Pond. I passed an old chimney from back in The 1700s. I Saw an American chestnut tree which is very rare for the Northeast due to Emerald Ash Beetle that infested the trees years ago and wiped out the population in the mid Atlantic and in the south. It's very rare to run across one or two here and there in the mid-Atlantic states of the Northeast. There were a lot of people here at upper Goose Pond, about 25 to 30 through hikers quite a few of them going southbound. And quite a few going north now. A lot of the hikers swim in the lake there. A lot of them camp by the lake that night. The water was just a little too cold for me. Most all hikers want to stop at upper goose Pond cabin because they have a bunkhouse and you get free coffee and blueberry pancakes in the morning for breakfast. Also to cool off by taking a swim in the lake. The next morning the coffee was good the pancakes were good but a little small. I expected them to be much larger however it's free they only asked that you leave a donation. I had for pancakes 2 cups of coffee and I left a three dollar donation. I love opera girls porn at about 10:00 AM heading for October mountain shelter. I got a late start so I did not get in much mileage and I was starting to feel worn down.

So I'll head out probably around nine and only do about 10 miles today. Got up this morning had a good conversation with two-step whose father is a Vietnam vet and served at the same time as I did. We talked about the Vietnam war we talked about McNamara and his hundred thousand man plan for Viet Nam and a lot of different things. And to my surprise, Two-Step for his age (24) was well-versed on a lot of what happened during the Vietnam War and a lot of the policies that McNamara I had in place in reference to The fighting forces and how they recruited from the Appalachian areas and in southern states. And the recruiting was all about recruiting the poor and economically depressed men and women. And to get these men and women into the military (even though most would not have been eligible under the the existing guidelines) to use them as fodder for the Vietnam War. I Said goodbye to Teradactle, Stack stack and Sir-poops-alot.

My destination was the Kay Wood shelter. I arrived at the shelter early 330 then took a break and then cooked my dinner and Max Pack walked into camp and we had dinner together.

I went toÂ the ShamrockÂ in but they didn't have any vacancies. But the lady called a guy name Tom Levardy, who came down and pick me up and took me to his house and let me camp in his backyard. I talked with him for a while and then took a nap. The old saying ""Bo Brown walk into town had breakfast and laid down"" LOL. So after my nap I got up went to Angelina's and had me a sub sandwich and I met up with Mack Pack who is staying at the Shamrock Inn. After my cheese steak sub (BTW in this part of the country they call a sub sandwich a ""Grinder"")Â I had a big helping of mango vanilla ice cream. Now I'm waiting on the ITC bus so I can go to Walmart and get a set of Â tent stakes because somewhere along the way I lost one. Oh, yes I went to the post office and picked up my package and went back to Tom Levardy's house and got my self situated. So after that, I walked down to Angelina's where I met with Max pack we sat and talked and had ice cream and again I'm waiting on the bus to take me to Walmart. It's been a lazy day not much hiking my right ankle is starting to bother me so maybe it needs a day off or a day of rest. So I'll cut back on the mileage. While at Tom Levardy's house, I met a hiker from Hyattsville Maryland and a hiker from Olney, Maryland and I met turbo from the Bronx New York and Stoop from Webster Missouri. A lot of local people stop by this house dropping off snacks. The next-door neighbor brought food over another neighbor brought candy and sodas. A lot of people in the community have done a lot of trail magic for us hikers. It's a great place nice quaint little town. I love the style of wood frame housing in this community with the wraparound front porch it almost reminds you of some of the Southern homes with the wraparound porches. There are about nine or 10 hikers here tonight. The rain has started. It's raining pretty hard and a little bit of thunder but no lightning and that's good. I hear the lady in the tent next to me complaining about the water getting inside her dad. She went to sleep without putting a rain cover over her tap what does she expect wow. Some of the high grades that were sleeping on the porch have now put up the accounts because of the rain with getting to them. A skunk passed by my tent. I guess it was foraging in the bushes looking for mice. The property owner Tom had mentioned about a skunk and raccoons foraging in the bushes around the yard looking for mice. So when I peeked from under my rain cover and saw it, it didn't scare me. But you could smell it LOL. During the night several people can't got flooded from the rain. My tent held up very well thank goodness. In the morning, Tom the property owner brought out coffee donuts snacks bananas oranges apples danish and served to the hikers. It was a great family style sitting at the picnic table for breakfast. Life is good at Tom Levardy's house for hikers. I really appreciate all he did for us.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575117,"8/12/17 I spent the night in my tent in the backyard at Tom Levardy's house and it rained all night but I stayed dry. A skunk went past my tent and moseyed on about himself and into the bushes. I guess it was looking for some mice. The guy from Prince Georges County Set by me and cookies for breakfast. We ate around the picnic table like a big family gathering it was a very nice breakfast. The sun is out and everyone's drying out their wet tents and sleeping bag that got wet from the storm. I got a full stomach and ready to hit the trail. Feels nice out today. Tom shuttled me to Cheshire, MA to pick up my mail and after repacking my Pack, he took me back to the trail head in Dalton. I then headed to the next shelter 14 miles away (Mark Noepel Shelter). The cat digit slept in my tent vestibule area to get out of the rain. He was nice and comfortable. Oh, while at the post office in Cheshire I Had a very good conversation with a lady that asked about my hike. The lady was surprised to find that I was hiking with no fibula bone in my left leg. She wished me well and to have a good hike. She also asked if I had a blog page or a journal page. So I gave her my journal page information and she said she would gladly read it.Â I got about a mile down rail outside of Cheshire and stopped at the Shell gas station which also has a Dunkin' Donuts in it. I got me a sausage egg and cheese sandwich, water and a muscle milk protein drink. I Made it up the 1,900 foot climb towards Mt Greylock. Due to the impending storms rolling in, I decided to call it a day at the Mark Nopel shelter (I didn't want to take a chance on trying to make it another 1500 feet of the mountain over at 3 mile stretch and get caught in the thunderstorm). I got to the shelter just ahead of the storm. Shortly thereafter, other hikers started showing up trying to beat the storm. In the end, I was in the shelterÂ with Mona, Monarch, Cuban, Huff and Wolf Dog. There is another lady but I don't remember her name, she set up her hammock and after hearing the thunder, she decided to take the hammock down and come inside the shelter. I told her that was a wise decision to be inside the shelter because of possible lightning strikes she laughed and agreed with me and said she don't know what she was thinking and knew it would thunder.Â Its Raining, thundering and lightning hard and scary outside right now at 8:09 PM. The other hikers are looking for their friend who hasn't showed up at the shelter thus far. They said she was a few minutes behind them and thought she would come to the shelter instead of going another mile to the campground or three miles to the lodge at Mt Greylock. I think she went to the campsite just passed this location. If she went all the way to the lodge at Mount Greylock, she would be crazy with the way the lightning was striking. But, you don't know what things or chances people take or do in bad weather situations. The storm went on for about four hours well past midnight. I heard a tree or two for somewhere nearby. Sometimes the lightning was so bright it was as if someone flash a camera strobe light in your face. The thunder was so loud it sounded like cannons firing next to you. The time between the thunder and the lightning strikes was literally seconds and they were powerful. On that note good night Viet Nam Vet.","Dalton, MA

After I had breakfast, I left the shelterÂ atÂ 7:50Â amÂ and started my ascent up the mountain to the Massachusetts War Memorial onÂ Mount Greylock. It was a tuff climb and I'm glad I didn't try to do it yesterday before the storm hit. I met several other hikers going southbound along the way. I made it to the top in about two hours. The climb was about 3,075 ft in all from the bottom of the mountain to the top of the mountain. While at the top, IÂ met a Navy nurse who served in Vietnam in 1967, she was from Virginia. We had a great conversation about the Navy Nurses and Corpsman who served in Viet Nam. I went into the snack bar and had a sirloin burger with coleslaw and potato salad and a coke cola. I talked with other hikers and ate lunch with them. I went inside the war Memorial tower and walked to the top to see the view. However the fog had not lifted, so I didn't have much of a view. I hung around a little longer and the skies cleared up so I got pictures of the view from the viewing points around the war Memorial Tower. Â At about 1230 orÂ 1 o'clock, I started my decent off the mountain. The decent wasn't too bad just a little rocky and slick from the mud and the wet rocks due to the rain last night.Â Along the trail going down, I met a guy (Sparky) who I had hiked with last year in Pennsylvania. Â Sparky was hiking with his son and their friends because they wanted to hike the highest mountain in Massachusetts. So they were hiking upÂ Mount GreylockÂ coming from the north. Sparky and I had a great conversation about our experience last year in PA. We had a good conversation and was glad to see each other since Pennsylvania in May 2016. I got down off ofÂ Mount GreylockÂ and started my climb upÂ mount Williams and met three other hikers, a pair that I been trailing for the past couple days. The view from Mount Williams is not that great unless you're 8 feet tall and you look over the trees LOL. So no pictures from Mount Williams. Well I made it off the mountain without injury or falling. It was a really rocky gnarly, steep and slippery decent. Everything was wet (the rocks and tree roots). The tree roots are an infamous tripping artist. They just out of nowhere reach up and grab you when and wherever they want. Step on a tree root with your feet at the wrong angle and you find yourself face down in the mud. The same goes for all the slick rocks too. That's why they call this state ""Massa-a-rootsus"". The first thing that happened to me when I crossed into Massachusetts was that I tripped and fell because of a tree root. After descending Mt Williams, I reached a road named ""Notch Rd"". Where I called a shuttle but the shuttle person taking me to the motel couldn't figure out where I was at and we kept loosing cell service. Well as luck would have it, I ran into two people doing trail magic on the trail near the Wilber Clearing Shelter and Notch Road. They were walking from the trail and they offered me drinks. I told them I needed a ride to Williamstown and they happily obliged me. They were Maddie and Jake. Â Super huge Thank you to Maddie and Jake for giving me a ride to Williamstown. Spent the night at the Willow motel in Williamstown Massachusetts. I checked in at the motel office and got my room key, then I went to the room and got a nice long hot shower. There is a swimming pool here but it was getting cool and late into the evening so I did not swim.Â I went to the Olympia pizza restaurant next door to the motel. At the restaurant, they gave me a 10% discount on my food. I ordered a small pepperoni and sausage pizza and 10 plain chicken wings. After I had dinner, I sorted through my things to get rid of the trash and re-organize. I stayed up late last night to catch up on my trail journal entries, so forgive me if I missed a few days.Â I have a maildrop to pick up tomorrow from the post office with my food supply.

The motel has a great continental breakfast for a small motel. The staff is nice and friendly. The accommodation and room is very nice and cozy. Had a good day of moving around with my newfound friend, her name is Carol she's from Ohio. I met her on the trail hiking upÂ Mount Greylock. Yesterday she took me to the post office to get my resupply package and to the CVS drugstore and to the laundry mat to do my clothes. Because she is section hiking, she parked her car atÂ Mount GreylockÂ and drove down to this motel where I met her again. That's how I was able to get around yesterday to run my errands and she was doing her errands as well. How lucky I was to run into her and she had a car LOL. Otherwise I would've walked a mile and a half to the post office and back and another half mile to the CVS. So her having a car was a blessing and I thank her very much for her generosity and kindness in taking me around to do my errands (the trail will provide, as we hikers say). The continental breakfast here at this hotel is out of this world, they have some of everything here and I mean some of everything. I had bagels with cream cheese, an Â orange, banana, cherries, blueberries BlackBerries, and orange juice that's what I had for my breakfast. The coffee was very good. It was just an amazing continental breakfast I have never seen one like that even in the big hotels. They had cereal's nuts and all kinds of fruit, tea, coffee several types of juices, bread, muffins, cake and just a whole lot of things. I spent the day organizing my stuff and just relaxing. I took a swim in the swimming pool and sat by the pool just relaxing. Later in the evening to other hikers, one name ""Heath Bar"" (I can't remember the other hikers name)Â and we sat around and talked they came off the trail because of the impending storms. They too love the motel here and thought the continental breakfast was the best they ever seen.Â I went to dinner at the Olympia pizza Italian restaurant next door. I had the baked ziti with sausage and a bowl of soup and a cold Yingling beer. The food was excellent and the wait staff was very very nice I had a good dinner.

Made my breakfast packed up my pack and just before heading out, The rain started and it came down with a vengeance. I tried waiting it out but it only slow down so I decided time to hit the trail about 830 this morning. My plan was to hike into Bennington Vermont which is a 9 mile hike. Left the shelter in the rain the trail was muddy slippery and wet. The rocks were slippery the tree roots were slippery it was just a hard day of hiking. Halfway into the hike, I had to descend from the mountain. Just as I started my decent, the rain started pouring with a vengeance (as if a fire hose was pointed at me on full blast) so I stopped and found a stand of spruce trees. I set up my Six Moon Gatewood Cape as a temporary shelter and sat out the rain for about a half hour until it slowed down. After it slowed down, I got back on trail and continue my hike to come down the mountain. Coming down the mountain, the trail was muddy slippery and very rocky all the way to the bottom which is about a mile and a half downhill. It was brutal and I mean really brutal on my leg and I ankles and the slippery rocks and the muddy foot path did me no justice. Several times I slipped but did not fall but they were close calls. It was just brutal, the worse downhill I have ever experienced thus far on the trail. Eventually I made it to the bottom of the mountain and Vermont Route 9. Before getting to the bottom I could see the road and the traffic on the road but getting to the road was still a half mile away. I was hiking with Kettering Strider, doc, general Hendrix, and several other hikers. Several of them slipped and fell but was not injured. We all made it down to the road safely, a few bumps and bruises and rolled ankle's but we were all OK. I rolled my ankle twice and banged my knee several times on the rocks. We tried hitching a ride into Bennington but had no luck. So we walked in the rain to Bennington. Most of them stopped in the downtown area and the local restaurants and post office. I went to the catamount motel and got a room for the night. It felt so good to get into the room and get out of the wet clothes and get a hot shower. After getting settled in, I went next-door to the gas station and got some hot pockets, a ginger-ale soda, Coca-Cola, a bear claw apple strudel, and a chocolate milk. I then ordered from A Italian restaurant that delivers food. I ordered the 10 Large teriyaki chicken wings and french fries. So, I had all of that for dinner. I topped it off with a snickers candy bar and a pint Jerry's mint chocolate chip ice cream. I then drink a 12 ounce bottle of electrolyte and a 12 ounce bottle of whey protein. My stomach is full and I feel good. Watching sports center and now it's passed hiker midnight so, I am saying good night from the Vietnam vet in Bennington Vermont.

It was a hard climb but it wasn't a brutal, it was difficult but not brutal. If your know what I mean, difficult but not brutal easy in some sections difficult another's steep and some switchbacks which made it a lot better. Before going up the mountain, someone had a trail magic container with oranges and it so I got two oranges to carry with me. I met Google who was southbound on the AT. I met ""Poops"" who is northbound and went past me. I hadn't seen poops cents the Delaware water gap. And then, A half hour later I saw Sir Poops-A-Lot, who I had not seen sense Goose-pond cabin. He's going up to Shelter to have lunch. I decided to stop here and sit on the rock where the powerline cables run through the valley and have my lunch. Â From the rock looking east you could see the pico ski resort ski runs very pretty very pretty big mountains and with very long sky runs. Sky lovers would have a great time there on the long sky slopes. While sitting on the rock aquamarine mountain Sarah and Lily both southbound, stopped and we talked for a while. I gave them information about the trail and the waterfall and the town of Killington and the best way to go into it using the side trail to the base camp outfitters store.

Got to the motel and got myself together, showered and clean myself up and walked a half mile back up the road to the country Farms gas station (where they sell chicken wings and sandwiches). Got dinner and walk back to the motel. After dinner I washed my clothes in the tub. Let my clothes dry in the sun on the lawn on the side of the building. When my clothes got dry, I took him inside. I got my clothes just in time because thunderstorm came and it rained hard for several hours. I watch TV and caught up on my emails and Facebook postings because I have been without service for three days. However, the internet and cell service was very spotty. They tell me the service in this area is lousy and yes it is very lousy. I went to bed for the night after posting on Facebook and in my journal.Â I got up this morning and had the continental breakfast. I took the day off and called a shuttle to take me to Norwich Vermont and from there I went to the library where I have good Internet service and get my plan together for my next move. I went to Dan and Wits grocery store to resupply for four days worth of food. Seems like the pack got heavier since I got the food LOL. I then rode the bus from Norwich into Hanover where I will passed Dartmouth university and they have aÂ farmers market going on across the street from the Hanover Inn. I caught the Brown bus from Norwich to the Handover Inn and then I caught the orange bus to where I stayed tonight, which is the Roadside Inn. The Roadside Inn is OK for Â the price. Teradactle, Stack, and Sir-Poops-A lot were all here at the motel. We stayed outside talking for a while and then I had to repack my pack before the next day. Again cell service not the best and the Internet is somewhat lousy. so I wasn't able to post on the Facebook from this location. After packing up my pack and getting ready to catch the bus, I saw root beer who I had not seen since Harpers Ferry West Virginia. I gave him and the German hiker and a Scottish hiker a ride back then. I gave them a ride in Harpers Ferry to the bed and breakfast they were staying at. I also took them around to do their resupply at the store. While talking to him, he offered to let me ride with him in the Uber to get back up to Dartmouth College. Where I will catch the Brown bus to go to Norwich, VT. From there I hike back into NH and through the town of Hanover (yeah sounds like I'm back tracking and i am, I want to hike into the state of NH and see the welcome to NH sign). I know it may not make sense to some of you but it makes perfectly good sense to us through-hikers.","

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576318,"8/24/17 I got up this morning went to their office and had continental breakfast. The wahoo machine wasn't working well. I take that back the wahoo machines working the wall mix was runny like milk so it didn't make. So, I had a bagel with cream cheese eggs, sausage links, and coffee. After breakfast I rode in the Uber car with pterodactyl into the town of Hanover. From there I caught the bus back to Norwich and then high back to Hanover. I did that so I would not but to mow hiking into the state of New Hampshire from Vermont. I also want to physically walk across the state line and get a picture of it as well. Therefore I don't know which to Hanover and got my picture on the bridge at The state line of Vermont and New Hampshire. I hung around in handover most of the day stopping in and browsing about. Stopping for lunch and a snack. And eventually I headed out of town about 130 in the afternoon. At that time, it's too late to do any serious hiking. So, I decided to hike to the first shelter outside handle which is the velvet rock shelter. On my hike up the mountain to the shelter, there were a group of about 12 students from.month college who were freshmen led by to sing this one near weeklong camping trip. After I got to the shelter and set my stuff up in the shelter, bass Brae and roll over and deacon came into the shelter or the camp area. I saw them earlier at the edge of town by the co-op. Come to find out, Deacon and I met in North Carolina and we missed Janet because we both rode in her band together. Also, rollover and Bear Spray are brothers they are about two years apart in age and they're from Pennsylvania. They are funny as all get out. They will keep you laughing. The two are a little chubby but they're working on getting the weight down through hiking. I'm glad to see them out here doing it their way and enjoying the moment. They are really super good young people.Â Later on two more hikers came in to camp that I had hiked with in North Carolina and Georgia. They are a husband and wife team. And after that, two more walked into camp. They are seniors like me lol, but they are just doing a section hike for two weeks and they are from Virginia (Roanoke and Charlottesville area). The two hikers from Virginia are retired recently and now they're out doing a section of New Hampshire. I got a good fire going. Everyone pretty much set around the farm and the shelter and just talk. College kids have their own area where they were mingling and talking. Everyone was having a good time and asked night begin to fall everyone going to their tents. College did not know what to do with their bags so two hikers from Virginia and I raked up a system and your food from the tree. They were unprepared for hanging their food bags so we assisted them and gave them additional rope to attach to the short rope the had. In the end, their food bags got hung properly. They thanked us and went to their tenting area. For a while they were a little loud but quieted Down and went to bed (hikers midnight cone early out here in the wilderness). Deacon were curious as to where Miss Janet was earlier today. So, I sent her a text message to see what state she was in. I just got a reply from her and she is in the Vermont New Hampshire area. She wanted to know why I explained that I might want to do some slack packing when I get in the area of Glenncliff, Â Hampshire if she would be available in that area next week. This Janet indicated that she would be in the area and want me to keep in touch. Well this will pass hiker midnight so Viet Nam Vet is going to bed good night everyone.","Woodstock, VT

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576320,"8/26/17 Â got up this morning had my breakfast, I stayed at the Moose Mountain shelter. It was a small shelter but nice. I was in there with the young lady named Emily who just finished high school and didn't know how to hang a bear bag so I showed her how to hang her food. That night I showed her how to hang the food bag and the next morning, I showed her how to retrieve it. we sat and had breakfast and talk I talked to her about a few trail tricks and wilderness. I told her about things to watch out for and to trust her instincts. She's section hiking to New York. Well I headed out on my 15 mile hike to the fire warden tower and cabin. I met many hikers along the way but most were south bounders and plenty of locals out for a day hike. I ran into fireproof who is going north in the same direction. I caught up to stovetop and Lee (there from Virginia) the two guys that I've been hiking with for the past several days. We stop at a couple places the brakes stopped and had lunch on top of smart mountain or part of smart mountain that is. And the climb up to the fire tower and Warden cabin was brutal brutal 5 mile climb at the end of the day. Don my client I had to climb some metal wrongs that were in the room with in the rocks I had work on rock slabs brutal brutal brutal uphill 5 miles. Made it to the fire tower and decided not to go to the top. I wanted to go and see the sunset but I was too tired to make the 80 foot climb to the top maybe I'll catch the sunrise in the morning. So it's dark now and I'm cooking my food and I think I will lay down and go to sleep after that. Tomorrow head out for the next shelter. But tonight I think I'm going to bed early. Haven't been able to post to my journal because no Wi-Fi and hardly any cell service since I entered the white national Forest. Oh well, I can't sleep because Stove Top and Lee are snoring in sync with each other lol. So, I'm starring out the cabin window from my sleeping bag at the beautiful bright stars in the night sky. The stars are so bright and the sky so dark, oh what a wonderful sight to behold right now. There is no glare from any city lights so I'm being treated to a pure natural night sky of stars ( damn it's absolutely beautiful and amazing). I only wish the more than 57,000 men and women who served in Viet Nam and the more than 300,000 post war casualties that lost their lives could witness what I'm seeing tonight in the night sky. May your patriotic warrior souls Rest In Peace in the comfort of the lords home, Amen.","Velvet Rocks Shelter

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576325,"8/27/17 stayed at the Fire Warden cabin on top of smart Mountain with Lee and Stove Top. Got up and had breakfast then left heading for Ore Mill campground. The climb up Smart Mountain was brutal. It was long, rocky and steep. I was rock climbing hand over hand. The climb was 5 miles long going up and 5 miles down hill. The downhill was just as brutal and horrendous on the knees and my left leg. However the views were magnificent. Before I left the mountain, I had lunch and soaked up the sun rays. On my decent, I called the Hiker Welcome Hostel for a shuttle pick up NH Rt 25A. It was 3:30 pm and the shuttle was scheduled to pick me up at 6:00 pm. I was 3.5 miles from the road. The down hill hike was so brutal that it took me Â three and a half hours to make it to the road. I fell twice and tripped multiple times due to the brutality of the decent. The shuttle driver ""Tricks"" picked me up and dropped me off at the Roadside Grill where I met ""Dickspatcher"" a retired fire fighter from Ohio. I had a coke, cheeseburger and fries. While eating and sitting around the fire pit, two out of state guys with their kids came over and engaged us in conversation. We had a good conversation with them but had to leave because Tricks had returned to pick us up to go to theÂ hostel. At the hostel, I saw Wonder Boy, Post Card, Mandy (the mutt dog) traveling with ""Life Raft"", all of whom I have been traveling with or trailing for the past week. Also, there were other NOBO's (North Â Bounders) at the hostel. There where two SOBS's, Sun Dog and She-Wolf. I had a beer, ice cream, pizza and coke while at the hostel. I took a shower (it's located outside with no roof but it was a good hot shower). After my shower, I sat in the lounge area and watched a movie and talked with the other hikers. I think Stove Top and Lee camped at the Ore Mill campground. I guess I'll see them tomorrow at the hostel. Well it's past hiker midnight so I will say good night.","Fire Warden Cabin on Smart Mountain (NH)

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577022,"8/29/17 woke upÂ at 6 AMÂ and begin packing for my hike over Mount Moossalauke ( 4,000 ft climb over a three mile stretch on the northern side and a 5 mile climb on the southern side.Â 6:45 AMÂ I went to breakfast and had pancakes, eggs, bacon, and coffee. Last night I met up with wondering Jay ( a Afghanistan war Vet U.S. Army who is hiking for comfort),Â Mud and Sludge, Bag of Tricks (who is the shuttle driver), Post Card, along with Life Raft and her dog Manny. Also No- Beard and Fire Proof and J-Swag were there. During the night some other hikers came in who I had hiked with in NC & GA (can't remember their names right now). The HostelÂ was being run by Legion, a through-hiker hiker from 2015. This really cool people running the place and some really good hydros coming through the place. The breakfast was just fabulous. Only drawback was the bunkhouse had no electricity or heat. The main house bunk area above the lounge area had no heat but it did have electricity. However, the bunk room did have mattresses and a pillow. So you got to sleep in your sleeping bag which is nice and comfortable. At least you're not out in the wind and elements (lol) and it was cold out. After breakfast, the shuttle driver picked up six of us and took us to mount Mousseau and we began our hike up the mountain. Trail is not marked with white blazes normal for the Appalachian trail. The trail was poorly more and poorly maintained in some areas. There were lots of side trails that were not marked. Some of the side trails were also a part of the Appalachian trail. But you did not know that unless you had a map from the Dartmouth outdoor club who owns that stretch ofÂ trail. As a result, people are always missing the turn off for the Dartmouth trail that a part of the trail because there is no white blaze or marker to let you know it's a part of the AT. Well here is my story and I am sticking to it LOL. I missed the turn for the AT but didn't know it and continued going southwesterly down the mountain until I passed a cut off trail (The Snapper Trail). I did not see a white blaze and I did not see the Appalachian trail symbol on the sign for the snapper trail so I bypassed it. AboutÂ 9/10Â of a mile down the trail and I realize the trail was not a trail. I had now come to a dead end. At that point I had to walkÂ 9/10Â of a mile back up the mountain to the last bypass trail I passed (The Snapper Trail). After getting back to the snapper trail, I saw no indication on the sign that it was part of the AT. The sign read (Snapper Trail 1.7 miles to the Moosalauke lodge). I then check my Guthook App to see where I was located on the mountain. But, that did not show my GPS position on the mountain because I was too far off the AT. So, I knew I had to make a decision based on the time of evening it was (4:30 pm), impending weather conditions (temperatures dropping into the 40's with 25% chance of rain), my physical condition at the time (I had already hiked 13 miles and most of it was uphill, so I was tired) and I had to take inventory of what I had available in my day Pack for use in the unlikely event I would be unexpectedly spending the night in the wilderness (and inventory of my pack revealed I had an emergency baby sack, a means to start a fire, enough snacks to last me a day, accomplice, a sawyer water purification filter and a first aid kit). The were the essential items I needed to spend the night in the wilderness. At that pout, I was not worried about sleeping out in the woods.Â Also, my cell phone battery was in the RED and dying and cell service for the trail was nonexistent. Realizing that, I still tried to call the hostel but with negative results. I thenÂ checked my phone to make sure nothing was running in the background and that I put the phone in airplane mode to prevent it from searching for cell service or Internet that did not exist in the area. I made it to the lodge but to my dismay, it was a construction work site. The only people their were construction workers (they were all from out of town and living in the on sight bunkhouse). I asked if any of them knew where the nearest paved road was located and they told me it was two miles away down the dirt construction road. Well, I started walking and made it to the road (which was NH Rt 118). I pulled out my compass and got my bearings. I knew I had to go in a westerly direction to get around to the front of Mt Moosalauke (were it would connect to the road to the hostel). The road was a deselect road and after a mile of walking on it, a car came from the opposite direction. I flagged the car down (it had PA tags with a woman and man). Turns out, they had just turned off of NH Rt 25 atÂ 118 the roadÂ I was trying to get to. They we two hikers on their way toÂ Lincoln, NHÂ (20 miles in the opposite direction I wanted to go) to drop off their resupply boxes for their southbound hike from Mt Katahdin in Maine. I explained my situation and asked it they'd mind going back 3 mikes to the road junction they just came from and drop me off. We had a conversation about where I was located (using an Atlas map and the ""AWOL"" guide book)). So, 15 minutes of conversation, The lady (who was about 30 and the man about the same age) said the weren't going in that direction and the didn't want to confit their On-board GPS system directions if they went in the opposite direction it was sending them. He said sorry wish we could help but we're going in the opposite direction. I was a little dismayed at first (especially about the cockamamie story of the GPS) but then I accepted the fact that they were just assholes and KARMA will deal with them. So, I simply said no worries and started walking down he road. After about ten minutes of walking, another car came going in the direction I was walking. I flagged them Dow and it was a couple in their 80's. I explained my situation and they said get in we will give you a ride. They told me it was out of their way but they had nothing but time and was out for their daily drive. When we got to the junction I was trying to get to, I got cell cell service and called the hostel to pick me up. The elderly couple said they'd to me to the gas station two miles further ahead and it would be easier for the hostel driver to get me. During the ride, they informed me that they were once avid hikers and knows what it's like when you need a ride. They dropped me off and I tried to give the money for the ride but they would not accept it. I thanked them and they drove off. The hostel driver picked me up and took me to the hostel. I told the other hikers of the story and they got pissed that other hikers left a hiker stranded. We'll, I had a beer and food and enjoyed the rest of the evening around the fire pit with the other hikers as we talked and watched Hiker-TV. After a shower, I went to bed.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577178,"9/6/17 hiked 15 miles in the 100 Mile Wilderness of Maine. I got up this morning at 6 o'clock at 6:30 we had breakfast at the hostel. Breakfast was blueberry pancakes, home fries, bacon, and eggs (they cooked them to your liking). I had three over easy eggs. While at the hospital I met graybeard who I hiked with in Georgia and North Carolina. I also hiked with another guy don't remember the name right now but I hiked with him, Â his father (Big Orange) and two brothers (one was called Flash) back in Georgia and North Carolina also. I also hiked with the girl name color and she's at the hostel as well. Unfortunately yesterday she fell and broke her right arm while hiking the trail so she's going to be off the trail for a few days or weeks. It's unfortunate because she's only 110 miles from the finish point which is Mount Katahdin the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. I hiked 15 miles today day in the rain pouring down stop then pours again. I crossed God knows how many Stream and two Rivers. At the one river which is about 100 yards wide, I slipped on the slick riverbed rocks in the water. Before crossing, I Took my socks and things off and put everything in the pack. The river bed rocks were just too slick. The rock was so slick as if someone poured oil on them. Well, I fell and got soaked all the way up to my neck. However, my pack stayed dry so that was good. Another hiker standing on a rock at the rivers edge was talking to his hike partner about a strategy to ford the Â river, suddenly and unexpectedly fell in the river. There's a rope that is used to stretch all the way across the river, so we pulled the rope all the way over to the other side but the rope was about 20 feet too short LOL life on the Appalachian trail. When I got on the other side I put my dry socks even though my shoes were wet ( I didn't want to get any blisters). I didn't have a change of pants so they were wet but they will dry out eventually. I check myself to make sure I didn't have any leeches hanging on me anywhere. After that I hit the trail again. Made several climbs not very big ones only about 500 to 800 feet but they were on a rock face (they were really slick so that slowed my progress) The first half of the 15 miles was just mud and tree roots and that was horrible. The middle part was somewhat OK until I hit the river and fell in the water. The last part of the trail was all rocks, it was just rocks rocks rocks and tree roots and rocks and rocks. I was just going very slow coming downhill and on the straightaways. Unfortunately today I fell 3 times. I fell in the bushes once, stepped wrong on a tree root. The other time I slipped off of a rock and fell into a pile of rocks. The last time I fell in the river and got soaking wet. Also after falling in the river and getting back on trail, I stopped at the shelter/lean-to and a wrong out my shirt, took my shirt off and put my down jacket on and then my raincoat over that and my pants, I put on the back of my pack and hiked in my underwear. I put on my down jacket to warm up and to get my body's core temperature back up to normal. I didn't wat to get hyperthermic. The last large creek I crossover was really treacherous but, I made it without falling. I hiked on and made it to my pick up point, where a shuttle would pick me up and take me to the hostel. Once at the hostel, I immediately took a hot shower and put my wet clothes in the on-site clothes dryer. I made my dinner from my hiking food because I was too tired to walk to the restaurant. Well it's past hiker midnight and I got another 15 mile day tomorrow (in the rain again). Good night. Viet Nam Vet","South end of 100 mile wilderness

It felt weird putting the pack on again since most of the time I've been slack packing. So the pack Is a little Â heavier because I have seven days worth of food and I need usually only carrying four days of food. Because I have to go through the last 60 miles of the 100 mile wilderness, I'm carrying more food than normal. I'm also caring heavier clothing because of the weather. I have two streams to forf and one canoe travel across the Kennebec River. I settled up my lodging fees with the hostel. My total cost here came to $255 they gave me a Vietnam veterans discount of $100 so that was great. Now I'm waiting on the shuttle to take me to Logan Brook Road where I'll get back on trail. It's been great staying here all I can say is wonderful place to take a day off and do some slack packing or just take a zero day. The people here are super nice and very helpful. They are very knowledgeable about all the trails and all the logging roads that run through the hundred mile wilderness. They would do A food drop for you if you want one. I chose not to do the food drop because of the cost and it's easier for me to carry seven days worth of food then to stop in the next three days and pick up a supply. The weather today is really nice sunny and in the 60s. I hiked 12 miles to Cooper Brook Lean-To. The trail was relatively nice after coming off Broadman mountain. I was able to move at a faster pace. I made it to the Lean-To and saw Doc was there. There was a couple there also who were celebrating the husband 50th birthday. There names are Penny and JB a US Naval Officer stationed in Norfolk, VA.

Wow, it was right on time and at the right spot because I had planned that to be my rest and snack spot. There were lots of hiker there, some I hadn't seen in a while like Wombat from Australia. I left there and continued up Trail a few miles to the Lower Jo-Mary lake. Wow what a beautiful camping and lake area. Met One-Night -Stand here at the lake, he camping here tonight and planing to do some fishing. Nice spot to fish too. I stopped to have lunch and then to hike on another three miles to the Potaywadjo Spring Lean-To. I had a nice one hour break now it's time to move on. I got to the Beach area a quarter of a mile away at Lower Mary Jo lake and saw giggles and scalawag. Giggles laid her hiking poles down on the beach area and couldn't remember where. So I helped her look for them for about 15 minutes and then I moved on. I got to the shelter and set up my sleeping area inside the shelter and started my food rehydrating. I then set out to collect fire wood to make fire. While eating my dinner I was joined by knuckles who is tenting and we talked for a few minutes in reference to the Harricane situation. He's currently living in the Virgin Islands but is from Maine. Also knuckles is only doing the hundred mile wilderness and that's it. I was up late last night watching the fire Â thinking about the end of this journey and all the military men and women that are not here to see this. I watch the moon and its bright glow settling into the wilderness. I had the shelter all to myself and lots of time to think and it was nice. I could hear moose in the distance calling probably another moose. I was awakened by the sound of a large animal in the stream (20 yards away). I wasn't sure what it was but I believe it may have been a Moose. I went back to sleep after a few minutes and the next time I awaken it was daylight.","Cooper Brook Falls Lean-To

Giggles found her hiking poles that she lost on the beach yesterday. A southbound picked them up and went to The next camping area so she had to go a mile and a half back to find them but she ended up with them anyway, that's good. I run into several other hikers I just don't remember the name right now. Trail was rugged in some areas and easy and others to climb over the mountain wasn't too bad. I got used to walking on level ground so long that climbing a mountain seem like it was a little difficult LOL. Along the way I stopped at the beach and cooled out for about a half hour. Nice scenery along the route because you're walking along the beach all it's a lake. The lake name is Nahmakanta. It's a beautiful lake, the trail goes actually down onto the beach area and some locations where you can wade in the water or fish. I just lay on the shore and watch the Waze like I did. Well I made it to the Â Wadleigh Stream Lean-To. I got to the shelter and took a short 45 minute nap. After I woke up several of the northbound hikers had passed me stop at the lake and cooled out for a while and then they came by the shelter on their way north. After my nap, I was on my way again. Finally I made it to the Hurd Brook Lean-to. It was a long day and I got into camp just before dark. Once in camp, I started gathering firewood to build a fire and cook my dinner. While gathering firewood a section hiker name steel hat came in. Steel Pot is 69 and retired military from Cleveland Ohio. Steel Pot is only doing the hundred mile wilderness. We both ate dinner together around the fire and he turned in early because he said he was bone tired LOL. I can understand that because I'm bone tired myself LOL. No wild animals to see today everything went OK had a good day in hundred mile wilderness. The weather has been Great and the trail has been forgiving, but I don't know how long that's going to last.

I could see the relief on his face that now having a filter to filter his water made a big difference to him. I'm glad I was able to help them out and had the extra filter with me. We said our goodbyesÂ and I started my long hike 13 miles to The Birches Lean-to's & Campsite in Baxter State Park. Once there, I called for the shuttle from the Appalachian trail lodge. The shuttle pick me up and took me to the lodge where I got settled in. The shadow cost me $90 but it was well worth it considering how bone tired I was. The hostel is OK not a bad place. The bunk beds have mattresses and you get sheet and pillow. They have several bathrooms throughout the place and showers. Overall it's a nice hostel and the owner a Purple Heart winner from Vietnam war and a veteran. He and I had plenty to talk about on the ride to the hostel really good guy. His daughter hippie chick is co-owner of Shaws hiker hostel in Monson Maine. After settling in, I saw plenty of other hikers I had seen on the trail since Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine. I talked with a lot of them and all of us are excited about summating Mount Katahdin tomorrow on 14 September. We talked about our journey, the long weeks and months on the trail, sleeping in the shelters and tenting, the hostels we stayed in and the towns we've gone through along the way. We asked each other about other hikers we had not seen and what happened to them or where they might be and who has summated Katahdin already. It was a good day and beautiful weather. I mean simply gorgeous weather 70Â° sunshine perfectly clear skies just a slight breeze. Absolutely perfect weather. Maine is a beautiful state with lots of wilderness pure unadulterated wilderness. Unfortunately, I did not see any moose or bear is a good thing not seeing a beat, but I really was hoping to see a moose. I was told by the shuttle driver that the moose I have been disappearing due to several factors. One of the main factors for the moose disappearing in this area is global warming, ticks have decimated the Moose population over the past several years and those left has moved further north because of the cooler temperatures. Gee I wish I could've seen a moose. I have seen plenty of moose droppings on the trail in the hundred mile wilderness but no moose. Well, I went to Angelenos Italian pizza cafÃ© and had pizza Coke and a cheeseburger for dinner. I return to the hostel and called it a night. I have an early day tomorrow. I will get shuttled at 6:30 AM to Baxter State Park where I will start my 5267 foot climb up to the summit of Mount Katahdin and end my Georgia to Maine Appalachian trail hike. Good night it is past hikers midnight. Viet Nam Vet.","Hurd Brook Lean-to

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578355,"9/14/17 I woke up this morning at 5 AM and cook my breakfast in the hostels kitchen I had grits with ham bits and, I drank a muscle milk, a protein drink and, had coffee. I finished getting my day pack together with snacks and energy gels for the long arduous climb up the mountain. The shuttle ride to Baxter State Park and the Hutt Trail which is also the Appalachian trail was quiet and somber. I, along with everyone else, in the van were probably thinking about todays adventure. The ride also allow you time to reflect on what you've gone through to reach this point. The shuttle driver as he rounded the corner on the highway and showed everyone the monster in front of us known as Mount Katahdin. It was an eye-opening, heart thumping, humbling and scary feeling looking at the enormous size of that mountain. To lighten up the moment, the shuttle driver turned on the radio in the truck and played the song ""Eye of the Tiger"" to pump everyone up and get you motivated for that climb. The song was just what we all needed at that moment. However for me it was my mental humming of the Marine Corps Hym. That was my motivation because I am a Marine. It was going to be me or Mt Katahdin. I was on a Marine Corps mission to fly the flag of the ""POW-MIA"" and nothing at this point was going to stop me from making the 5,267 foot climb to the summit of Mt Katahdin. After entering the park and getting dropped off at the Hunt Trail which is also the Appalachian trail, the driver gave us instructions on where the shuttle would be and what time the shuttle would be there to pick us up and take us back to the hostel. The endpoint for pick up would be The Abol bridge campground and that the times would be 3:30 PM and the last shuttle leaving at 4:30 PM for the hostel. The shuttle driver also let us know that if we were going to be late getting to the pick up point to contact them to let them know. I was concerned about the short window of time to make that 5000+ foot climb and then come down the backside of that mountain within such a small window of time (8 -1/2 hours). The small window of time that did not allow you to linger at the summit and enjoy the moment of your journey victory. The younger hikers would do that entire hike in about 6 to 7 hours. Older hikers 50+ takes about 8 to 9 hours to do that type of a strenuous hike. It is a 5267 foot climb most of the way up is over rocks and boulders which slow your time down to about half a mile to a mile an hour. The younger hikers do about a mile an hour making that climb. Older hikers like myself and especially with a bad leg is only doing about a half mile an hour climbing over and pulling yourself up over the boulders and rocks. The climb up is 5.2 miles to the summit and 5.1 miles to get down off the mountain and again over rocks and boulders. So, as you can see I was concerned about making that cut off time for the shuttle. There was no doubt I probably would miss the shuttle cut off time due to my handicap of having no fibula bone in my left leg. I started my climb up Mount Katahdin and I moved as swiftly as I could which was very slow and about half mile an hour. The climb up was brutal after the 1stÂ 1/2 mile and after passing the Katahdin stream waterfall, the trail got very rugged and I was rock hopping and rock climbing the rest of the way. Most of the young hikers, had already passed me and a few older but younger than me hikers were moving out about my same pace and some eventually pulled away and continue up. When I reach the area that was boulders that I had to climb over, I was having a difficult time pulling myself up on things because there were no points in which to grip the rock. This section of the trail was called the gateway. This is where the trail is nearly Technical climbing and very very steep all the way up to the Hunt Trail and able Bridge Trail spur.Â Â Having short legs didn't help much either. In some places they had steel rebar sticking out of the rock that you could use to assist in pulling yourself up. It was a brutal gnarly climb up to 3000 feet and above tree line. It was an on adulterated hand over hand, crawling on your knees and squeeze in between boulders relentless walking on slick table rock with narrow edges climb. Every step and every place you place your hands or feet had to be strategically planned before you made the move. Otherwise, it Â could result in a catastrophic fall.Â Once I got up above tree line 3,333 feet, I was able to see the awesome view of the valley below (The Great Basin valley and Chimney Pond). I knew I could not linger long at this position because the clock was ticking to get up the mountain and off the mountain in time to catch a shuttle. I knew Without a doubt, felt I probably would miss the shuttle. However, I decided I wasn't going to worry about catching the shuttle because in my mind, I knew the trail would provide. I lived by that slogan doing my entire hike that whatever came up and whatever I may need the trail would provide. I continued my climb to what is known as the ""Tablelands, a flat rocky section of the trail that follows the spine of the mountain. Until I reach that section,Â the trail got very gnarly and rugged and it just continued on and on. But, I was relentless in my belief. I knew nothing could stop me short of a catastrophic fall. Walking along some of the tight/narrow edges and slippery ball face boulders and rocks that a catastrophic fall was a possibility. However, in my eyes to complete my mission I knew I could no longer think about a catastrophic fall and only think about reaching the summit. I reach the point where what I thought was the spine of the mountain and yes it was the spine of the mountain and Tableland. I'd climb that and realize I still had a mile and 2/10 to go. The trail was very rocky and there was a sign telling hikers to stay on the trail because of the regrowth revegetation project in progress and to stay within the roped off area of the trail. I reach the split in the trail (AT & Abol Bridge Trail) where the Thoreau spring was located. I figured I could get water on the way back down. I still had a liter of water to make it to the summit. At that point, I met a former Marine Afghanistan war veteran by the name of Todd and his wife. I hiked the rest of the way to the summit with the two of them and we had good conversations up to the summit. He was amazed at my agility and ability to move with the pace I did and not having a fibula bone in my left leg. Hey said to me ""dude you are a beast of a marine, your a bad ass for sure and I'd go into combat with you any day"". I thanked him for the compliment and continued to climb the beast of a mountain that was draining me dry of my physical strength but not my mental tenacity.Â The sun was relentless and there was no breeze blowing until we made the final push up the last part of the spine of the mountain to the summit. Once we reached the very top and walk towards the iconic Mount Katahdin sign the breeze picked up. The temperature was slightly cooler but, the sky was very clear and beautiful and the sun was still shining and warm. It was A beautiful day for a hike and a beautiful day to be on the summit of Mount Katahdin. I reach the sign and touched it and felt total relief. I then pulled out my POW MIA flag and let it unfurled in the breeze on Mount Katahdin in respect for those who served and are still missing and those who have been repatriated back to American soil. It was a glorious day to fly the POWMIA flag. A flag I carried every step of the way on the trail. I then celebrated with Todd and he held the American flag and I held the Marine Corps flag at the iconic sign Â on Mount Katahdin. After spending a half an hour at the summit, I noticed the rain clouds moving in and I decided it was time to get off the mountain. I started my hike down the mountain along with Todd and his wife and a few other hikers. At the spring I filled up my 1 L water bladder and my one later smart water bottle. I continue down the Abol bridge trail and it was a gnarly downhill decent after coming off the spine of the mountain. There are areas where I had to hang up at one Boulder and slide down to the next. The loose rock scree was treacherous and slippery. That was the condition for the first half mile down the mountain. Once I reached the switchbacks the trail was a lot better but still rocky with tree roots and slick muddy spots. So I still had to be cautious as to where I place my feet. The downhill dissent was tiring I stopped and took a break on two occasions my legs were feeling the effects of the downhill pressure on my ankle and knees. As I continue down the mountain, I noticed another hike name Steve who looked to be slightly disoriented. He was wobbly and stumbling and swaying side to side. I asked him if he was OK and he stated he was tired and his legs felt like rubber. I found a tree branch that I fashioned to a Walkingstick for him and asked him to use it to help stabilize himself. He used the stick to help stabilize himself and continued walking but still he was wobbly. I asked him if he was diabetic and if he needed some hard candy to boost his sugar levels. He indicated he was not diabetic but he was just tired. After a few more minutes, I asked him if he had water. Steve stated he ran out of water and hour ago and needed a drink. We then stopped and I filtered a liter of water from my smart water bottle into his water bottle. He was very appreciative. I told him to just sit down and drink as much water as he could because I still had another liter of water and I was doing OK. He drink the water and rested for moment and felt a lot better. We got up and I walked slowly with him the rest of the way down The mountain. We chatted along the way and I told him I am sure I have missed my shuttle ride back to the hostel in Millinocket. He indicated he had his truck there at the campground. I asked if he could give me a ride to Millinocket and the hostel. He stated yes he would give me a ride and that he too was staying at the AT Lodge hostile. Once read reach the able campground and the ranger station, a camper who drove to the ranger station to buy wood, I asked him if he would give Steve a ride to his car at the at Katahdin Stream Campground. The driver said yes he would. The walk to the campground would have been a 2 mile walk that I am sure Stevie would not have made it before dark fell. Steve left his pack with me and said he would pick me up on the way back with his truck. Steve pick me up with his truck as promised and we drove to Millinocket in the hospital. We had a great conversation on our way there. Steve is from New Jersey and was only going to do Mount Katahdin and the hundred mile wilderness going southbound. When I was coming down the mountain, I got a cell service and I call the hostel to try and make arrangements to be picked up. The lady answering the phone told me to check with the ranger station and see what my options were to get a ride out of the Baxter State Park. I tried to explain to her that my equipment and I were staying there at the hostel and she just told me to check with the Ranger to see what my options were. I was thinking why do I need to check with the Ranger he's not going to give me a ride. I wanted them to give me a ride and I was willing to pay for the shuttle. The next morning I spoke with the hostel owner about the situation of not being able to get the lady to send a shuttle to pick me up. He was apologetic but that was not what I expected. He asked if I hitch a ride and I told him no I was fortunate enough to find another hiker Who I had helped that had his truck there at the park. The hikers Steve that gave me a ride to the hostel. I realize it was fruitless to try to argue the point and just said to him, no worries the trail provided for me. I then waited on my shuttle to take me to Monson and Shaws hiker hostel where I headed towards the presidential mountains to knock out the section I jumped over so I would make Katahdin before the weather got bad.","Katahdin Stream Campground

He started in March on Springer Mountain and stopped here for the night (6 months Â ago). Yep, heâs still here and working as the go to guy for the owner. He says heâll get back on trail in March and continue his hike north. I Got me a bunk space in a semi-private room. Iâm sharing the room with a SOBS thru-hike from Rockville, Maryland name âcounselorâ. Great guy. He started his thru-hike in June going southbound from Katahdin. We talked about the trail and about the good vs bad hostels, mainly those south of here. I have been/hiked the trail South of the smokies but not hi. I shared what I know of the trail and hostel along the way. The weather here changed over the past 2 days from what was forecast. Itâs in the low fifties compared to mid seventies. Also it rained and that to contributed to the low temperatures. Iâm hoping it will warm up tomorrow to the mid seventies as forecasted for the rest of the week.

I had my breakfast and then I gave the dog one of my breakfast grits and chicken bits and use my stove container to get water for the dog. I found an old large piece of tent spread on the ground so the dog could lay on it to stay warm. Iâve contacted the owner this morning and talk with him he wanted me to tie her to a tree until his friend got here. I decided to stay with the dog while she was tied to the tree. I decided to stay with the dog because I was concerned that she would not be able to defend herself if a predatory animal showed up. So I guess I wonât be able to catch up to Morocco mobile and Bill Wolf. Iâll probably catch up with them in the next couple of days. Hopefully the owner will show up or his friend shall I say in the next hour it is 10:27 AM. I heard back from the owner and the pick person canât find the shelter. I told him to have the pickup person to meet me at Greasy Creek which is 2 miles from my current location. The owner agreed so off I went with the dog on a rope leash. The good thing is the dog was pulling me faster than I walked lol. Well, we made it to the pickup point and the driver was happy and so was I. The driver then offered to take me to my location which was the Greasy Creek Hostel. He offered me money but I wouldnât take it. I told him to pay it forward to someone in need. I checked into the hostel (a typical country farm house from the 30âs). The rickety front porch with willow tree guard and hand rail and pine tree supports for the porch tin roof. They have 3 dogs that were very friendly and like nudging up next to you. Inside the house was as old as the outside but it was very neat and clean. The heat source for the house is a wood stove. However, the house has indoor plumbing and electricity. The owner and helper are great people. There were three other southbound hikers there when I got there. The hikers had been at the shelter with me last night (Tuesday night). There was a hiker there that was a section hiker who was now ending his hike and going home to Florida (he said it was to cold for him to continue).

Apparently no one stoked The far to keep it going last night so it was a little chilly. Got a late start because the hospital owner had to do a early morning shuttle. I finally got on trail aboutÂ 11 oâclock. I hiked 3 miles to Cherry gap shelter where I saw Suraci andÂ 2 AMÂ taking a lunch break. On the trail up here Suraci andÂ 2 AMÂ pass me but the girl sweet blood did not. When I got to the shelter and saw the other two they told me sweet blood had not gotten here. So I got water and mix my protein drink and drank it and and ate a protein bar and some corn bugles. I also drink half a liter of water and a electrolyte drink. Sweet blood still has not shown up. I told Suraci I would wait here with his gear while he go back to try and find her.Â 2 AMÂ continued on his hike. Suraci return to the shelter and hour later. He informed me that he may contact with sweet blood and that she hitch hike a ride into Erwin because she wasnât feeling better. Her Suraci andÂ 2 AMÂ all three came down with a Nuro virus and were quarantined at the greasy Creek house. After Suraci return I then took off on my hike an hour later than I wanted but thatâs OK. I made the 3000 foot climb up Unaka mountain and down the other side. On my way down the north side of the mountain. There was a Christmas tree with ornaments and decorations at about 500 feet from the summit of the mountain. It was pretty neat. Someone apparently is taking care of the tree because they have solar lighting around the base of the tree. I continued my journey down the mountain and came to the US Forest Service Rd., #230. I then met Rodney who is a forest service employee and he asked if I needed water. He gave me two bottles of water. We talked for a few minutes while I set up my camp. He gave me some paper towel roll inserts to start my fire. I am camped just 10 yards from the forest service road. I gathered up firewood and then set up my tent and started my dinner. I ate dinner while tending to the fire. Now, Iâm watching the sparkling stars in the sky. Occasionally I see a planeâs blinking lights across the skyline. The green light and red light from the Planes are really beautiful against the night sky. The stars remind me of sparkling water that glisten and are so bright. They remind me of the sparkling water in Georgia. That water was the clearest water I have seen and it tasted good LOL. Working my way to Georgia to get that sparkling water (lol). Itâs really a beautiful night and the sky is clear and sparkling with stars.

The one saving grace about the trail is that its forgiving and the switchbacks are great. The climbs are not steep and knarly but gradual and semi-smooth. That alone made the climb easier and much better. It also made for making good time and distance. Thank god for the switchbacks in TN/NC. I made it to the shelter and got a fire going and set up my sleeping spot in the shelter. Got my food soaking so it can rehydrate and be ready to heat up by the time the fire gets going well. I fetched me some water from the water source (enough to have some for the next morning's breakfast and to top off my water bottles). I was the only hiker at the shelter and that was ok with me. I was tired and beat but feeling good that I made it to the shelter before dark. After dinner, I got into my sleeping bag and just looked at the stars and listened to the sounds of the wilderness. Oh how wonderful it feels to be out here and enjoying nature and all she has to offer. Well, its past hiker midnight so good night Viet Nam Vet","Hot Springs, NC

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580102,"10/23/17 Woke up and made breakfast and hit the trail. I hiked out with most of the hike being downhill on switchbacks (god I love theses TN/NC switchbacks lol). I met several day hikers along the way and just one or two southbound thru-hikers. The views from atop ""Big Stamp saddle"" was great. the Views from Meadow Mountain were just as fabulous. Wow, just some wonderful views no matter what mountain top you're on. I made it to Sam's Gap and US 23 and I-26. A driver stopped while I was making a road crossing and he asked where was I going or trying to het to? After checking out his car and seeing his back pack and the AT stickers on the car and his hat, I asked him were was he heading and he said Hot Springs to the Elmers Sunnybank Inn. I told him that Hot Springs Laughing Heart Hostel is were I was headed. He said get in and I'll drop you off there. I got in and we drove off to hot springs. Come to find out he lived in Fairfax VA and was out doing his section hiking before it got to cold. We had a good conversation all the way to Hot Springs, NC. he dropped me off and on down the road he went. I went into the Hostel and met Jeff the care taker and Frank a hiker who walking in a month ago and haven't left but stayed on as a helper for free bunk stay.Â Jeff gave me the run down on how things work at the Hostel. Afterwards, I claimed me a bunk space and went about exploring the facilities and the lodge that was across the lawn from the hostel. The Lodge was built in 1840 and was a Jesuit retreat back when it was built. The lodge is well appointed with hardwood flooring and oak wood trim. Its simply gorgeous inside. While I was there the Lodge was housing students who were attending a massage school training in town (Hot Springs). I saw ""2 AM"", Counselor, Ash and her crew of six, and three ATC volunteer trail crew members. The hostel was almost filled due to the heavy rain that had moved in from the south. I met Laura a want-to-be-thru hiker in 2018. We had a good conversation about gear, the trail, the trail community and the camaraderie the trail offers. She stopped in for a few days on her way to family in NC and her mini van was setup comfortably for camping along the way. She is a retired CPA who wanted to travel the trail to see and get a feel for what she wanted to do in 2018. Jeff, the care taker had gone out earlier and bought steaks, potatoes, salad, shrimp, sushi and beer for everyone. He cooked up the food with the help of Frank and another hiker and served everyone. That was one great steak meal. Wow, who would have suspected such a great trail magic hiker feed at the hostel (not me but it was great). Later, I sat and talked with Frank and Jeff while drinking a few beers. We had a great conversation and plenty of laughs about the trail and about our childhood growing up. It was a great time to be had by all. Well, its past hiker midnight so good night, Viet Nam Vet","Bald Mountain Shelter

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580105,"10/24/17 I woke up and made my breakfast in the kitchen area of the hostel. I packed up and headed out just at the crack of dawn to get an early start knowing I had a lot of climbing to do before the day was over. As I headed out, I said my good bye's to everyone and hit the trail that's right behind the hostel. I started my 1,500 foot climb on the switchbacks to the deer Park Shelter. I got to the shelter and had a quick snack and an electrolyte drink to keep up my energy for the 2,500 foot climb I would have to make to the summit of Bluff Mountain. As I climbed towards the summit ofÂ Bluff Mountain, several other hikers I had stayed with at the hostel passed me by on their climb up the mountain. Thank god for the switchbacks because they made the climb more doable and easier on the legs. The trail was in good condition with a few muddy spots here and there but otherwise good. I stopped again at a spring about 2/3 the way up and rehydrated and topped off my water bladder. When I reached the summit, the views were simply beautiful, beyond words. As I surveyed the distant this point,Â mountain ranges and valleys, I couldn't help but think about the Old Glory and the song America The Beautiful when it says ""Purple Mountains"". The hues of the distant mountain ranges actually appear purple on ones eyes. There were several other hikers up on the summit that were out for day hikes and we spoke briefly on the beauty of the vistas before us. after about twenty-minutes on the summit, I headed down the mountain to where I would camp for the night. I wanted to reach the campsite before dark fell. I reached the camp site and started setting up my tent so it was positioned with the back wall into the wind as recommended (Six Moon Lunar Solo). I got my food prepped and in water to rehydrate while getting a fire going. I alsoÂ strung a line for my food bag when I finished eating and cleaning up my cooking gear. As the fire got going good, the temperature starting dropping rather quickly as the sun faded behind the mountain. At this point, the temperature was around 32 degrees and winds of about 15 mph. I ate dinner in the dark sitting around the fire pitÂ watching hikerÂ TV (the fire is the Hiker's TV). After finishing my dinner and cleaning up, I hung my food bag. I sat at the Hiker TV until all the flames had died away and then I checked the security of my tent and stakes, due to the increase in the wind speed. When all was good, I got into my sleeping bag with bare minimum clothing on so that my body heat would be trapped by the down insulation in the bag. After about twenty minutes, I was warm and toasty. I could also hear that the intensity of the wind was so strong that the trees were creaking and limb crackling.Â The rear wall of my tent was taking the brunt of the wind forceÂ hitting it and it was shaking in a rippling affect. Glad I set it up as recommended, as I always do. I fell asleep and slept well until I had to get up and pee. Yes, it always happen when youre nice and warm andÂ cozy. Well, I went outside to do my business and it was freezing with the howling winds. I got back into my sleeping bag and checked my altimeter/barometer and the temperatures was 21 degrees. The wind mustÂ  haave been blowing at about 30 mph with gust up to 40 mph. I eventually went back to sleep. I woke up at 6:45 am and started packing up my gear. I decided not to make breakfast in the freezing cold. It was still dark out and the sun wouldn't rise until 7:46 AM.","Hot Springs

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580106,"Woke up at 6:30 Am. It was still dark outside and I packed up my stuff to get an early start at the crack of dawn. I decided not to try and cook a breakfast or make coffee in the brutal cold temperatures but instead would stop later and make breakfast when the sun was out. I packed up everything and poured the remaining extra water I had onto the warm ashes in the fire pit. And, down the trail I went. because It was all down hill, I picked up my pace to generate some body heat and that I did. I made it to the Walnut Mountain Shelter where I made and ate my breakfast in the sunshine. Yes, it was still cold as hell but the sun had a warming effect on the body, soul and mind. After eating, I got back on trail and make the 500 foot climb up and over Walnut Mountain. I continued on with a gradual climb of 1,000 feet over a 3.5 mile stretch to the Roaring Fork Shelter. I made it to the shelter and followed my routine of claiming a spot in the shelter, prepping my food and stringing a food bag line (at this shelter no need to string a line because they have a bear cabling system).Â After getting the fire going, a NOBO hiker shows up and was happy to see I had a fire going. We sat and talked (his trail name is Crap Shoot). I didn't want to know how he got that name lol. Shortly after that, Counselor shows up tired and cold after hiking 18 miles. he too was happy to see the fire. They both sat at the fire until warmed and then set out to gather more fire wood. I began to cook my dinner while talking with Crap Shoot and Counselor. They too made their dinner and we all sat around the hiker TV and ate and talked. The fire at this point was roaring and putting off some great heat. We all hung our food bags and eventually nestled into our sleeping bags with a full belly and warm body from the heat of the fire. once the flames died down to no flames, I fell asleep. I was awaken by the loud snoring of Counselor who by the way, woke himself up from his own loud snoring. Long day tomorrow so good night again Viet Nam Vet","Catpen Gap (Primitive campsite)

They both head out by 7:30 and I'm still in my sleeping bag waiting on the daylight to come in. I finally get up and moving when the sun rise and make my breakfast and pack up. I use the remaining extra water I have to pour over the warm ashes. I decided it was going to be a low mileage day to give my left leg a rest. I start my hike and the temperature has risen to about 50 degrees and that's great with me. most of my hike will be down hill except for a few short gradual climbs and the long climb up to Max Patch on Snowbird Mountain. I made it to Max Patch and enjoyed the 360 degree views the summit had to offer. There were several other people up on the Patch also enjoying the views and the warm sunshine. I sat on the concrete block that held the survey marker while taking pictures and posting them on Facebook. I walked around theÂ bald and continued to enjoy the views from all around the bald. I could see Snowbird Mountain with the FAA Tower on it.Â I could clearly see little villages inÂ between the mountains in the valleys below. I left the mountain going south down some steep areas with steps. there was someÂ gentle areasÂ in most places butÂ it was theÂ few steep sections that wore on my leg and I had to stop and rest the leg.Â After resting, I continued on down the mountain into a pine forest where I collected pine needles to make pine needle tea later with my dinner. After passing through the pine forest, I continued on down the mountain to Deep Gap where I got off the AT an onto the blue blazed trail for the Groundhog Creek Shelter. Once at the shelter, I claimed a spot inside the shelter and set about my routine of prepping my food and getting a fire going and collecting firewood. I saw that a Bear cabling system was present so there was no need to string a food bag line. As I collected firewood, a section hiker shows up and later a thru-hiker who I had seen at the laughing heart hostel. The two set up their sleeping areas in the shelter and went out to collect more firewood. as the evening wore on, we talked and ate dinner. The section hiker's name is Jay and he's from Calvert County Maryland and works at the Patuxent Naval facility. He told me he had met Counselor (who was southbound) at the last shelter he stopped in for lunch (Jay is hiking northbound). The thru hiker (I cant remember his name) is a high school grad and only 18 years old. he decided to hike the trail to decided what he wants to do in life. He's not considering college and really has no options to consider when talking with him. So Jay, a retired Marine talked to him about joining the military (any branch) just so he would at least have that as a starting point in his life. I spoke to him about going to a trade school (one that he felt he had the skills for). I explained to him how having a trade is something he could always fall back on should times get lean. by the end of the evening, he was asking a ton of questions about the military and life in the military. He also indicated he was interested in plumbing because that's a job he worked at during the last two summers of high school. Jay then suggested to him that the Navy CB's might be an option for him militarily and I suggested looking into a union plumbing trade school. I think by the time we all laid down for the night, the young man now had options he hadn't had before. As the fireÂ flames goÂ down and the flames disappear, it is way past hiker midnight.

Jay was just waking up as well and starting to make his breakfast. We both ate and talked about the younger hiker and wished him well in deciding what to do with his life. After breakfast, we both headed out with Jay going northbound and me going southbound. I knew I had a big climb ahead of me but I didn't know it was going to start right after leaving the shelter (lol). Well never the less, the climb was upon me and there was nothing to do but make the 1,500 foot climb to the summit of Snowbird Mountain. The climb was steep switchbacks in some area and gentle switchbacks in other sections. Overall, the climb was long and sometimes brutal. As I neared the summit, the trail showed signs of an early frost that was now being melted by the sun. The view at the summit was again, simply marvelous. Its the views one sees with the naked eye that makes all this hiking and climbing worth every ache and pain. The grassy bald was the perfect place to view the Great Smoky Mountains as theyÂ rolled along the skyline with its beautiful fall colors and the majestic purple hue, absolutely stunning.Â The grassy bald at the time was free of people other than myself. I had the whole bald to myself, oh what a wonderful feeling to feel as though you're all alone on top of the world eyeing gods great creation. Simply awesome my friend, simply awesome. As I hiked further up the mountain and just before reaching the bald of Snowbird mountain, The FAA tower came into view. It looked like something out of a sci-fi movie and as I got closer to the tower, I could hear a humming sound from the equipment that must be inside the tower. The fence around the tower bore its Federal Government warning signs to keep out. I walked around the tower to discover more stunning views of the valleys and mountain ranges. Wow is all I could say about the beauty this mountain beheld. After spending a good forty-five minutes on the summit and having a snack, I headed down the mountain towards Davenport Gap. I Spanish Oak Gap and took a break to rest my leg and to get in a snack. Afterwards, I continued on down the mountain towards I-40 and the Pigeon River Bridge. I made it to davenport shelter and realized I was low on fuel for my Alcohol stove and about 3 days short on rations for the Smokies. At that point I had to make a decision. Do I continue on and run out of food?Â You know the answer to that was a big fat NO. So, I decided to hike backÂ two miles and do a re-supply at the Standing Bear Farm Hostel. better safe than sorry I thought and the weather was turning funkier. Rain was in the forecast for Saturday and snow forÂ Sunday in theÂ Smokies. It was a no brainer to go to the Standing Bear Hostel and be out of the weather and re-supply at the same time and sleep in a real bunk bed in a room with heat :-).Â I made it to the hostel and met Morgan and John. John signed me in and gave me the run down on everything. I claimed me a bunk and wasÂ given clean linen and pillow case. I pulled out my sleeping bang just in case it would get cold as the wood burning stove died down (lack of someone stoking and adding wood to it).Â There were other hikers there that I had seen on the trail over the past few days. After I resupplied, I went to the kitchen area where everyone seems to gather and, made my diner and talked about the trail life and where we were all from. Morgan, the owners son made a food and beer run into the town of Hartford four miles away. I had him to pick up a six pack of beer (any kind). Just after I got to the shelter, John gave me a Fat Tire Beer as a welcome gift. That was a good beer. I wanted Morgan to get me some of that but he said they didn't sell it at the place he was going to. So, I told him to get whatever they had. He returned with the beer (two Hearted Ale) and it too was good and I shared the rest with the other hikers. Well its nice and toasty in here and the rain is coming down and its past hiker midnight.

Viet Nam Vet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580112,"10/28/17 Woke up and it was a little cool in the hostel, I packed up and had breakfast before heading out on the trail. Paid for my stay and said my good bye's and headed to the trail. I knew I had a long climb up out of the holler to reach Mt Cammerer summit and the look out tower on the summit. The weather was funky with the morning fog and low cloud ceiling with the expectation of snow. I was well prepared now with plenty of food and fuel to get me through the Smokies. The climb was tuff and brutal in the cold weather so I had to keep moving to keep up my core temperature and continually generate body heat. The 3,000 foot climb was brutal even though the switchbacks saved the day again. My hold focus was just on climbing, keeping my feet moving no matter howÂ long my walking gate was. Even if I could only step inches at a time, the focus was still on keeping my feet moving. Every so often look upÂ briefly to see what's ahead but just keep moving the feet.Â Along the way, I was passed by another thru hiker who was moving just a tad faster than me. he asked how was I doing and I stated ""I'm making it"". He said he was too but very slowly cause he was running out of steam after hiking ten miles to davenport gap and now this five mile up hill climb to the summit. He stated he was going to camp at the camping area just before the shelter. I said I'm going to try and make it to the shelter to get out of the weather. He moved on and I continued my slow pace up the mountain and to the summit with a light snow fall that continued to follow me to the summit and beyond. At the summit,Â the view was lousy so I continued on down the mountain to the shelter. I reached the shelter and went through my routine. I claimed a spot in the double decker shelter, prepped my food, gathered firewood and made a fire. IÂ am the only one at the shelter. I got a fire going ate dinner early. Four other hikers came in for the night that had been at the hostel.Â I talked with themÂ briefly and off to bed I go. The temperature was in the low 30's with a clear sky now that the snow had stopped. It wasn't much of any accumulation but just more of a nuisance snow. As I lay in my sleeping bag I can hear the others planning out their day for tomorrow and beyond. They're thinking of doing 20 miles to make up time due to yesterdays rain storm. Well I'm not thinking about any 20 milers going through these Smoky mountains. Well its past hiker midnight so good night Viet Nam Vet.","Standing Bear Farm Hostel

I laid in my bag until the daylight arrived. I made breakfast and packed up at the same time. After eating, I hit the trail. I know I have some climbing to do so I'm leaving out just a little earlier (8:30 AM). After leaving the shelter I made the climb up out of the holler onto the ridge and back down into another holler (Camel Gap)and up another climb to the summit of Deer Creek Gap. during the climb, I came across and old airplane wreckage site. From what I was told, the crash occurred over a decade ago. However, there are still some signs of the wreckage on the hill side that can't be accessed. Interesting is all I can say. As I continued on the views were nice but not all was visible because of the low cloud ceiling and it was mostly cloudy with spurts of sunshine here and there. I stopped several time to replenish my water and take snack breaks. I was wearing down from the long climbs up to and over 5,000 feet over the past several days. The climb to day was up to 5,500 feet. I'm at the shelter and the elevation is 4,900 feet according to my altimeter. I claimed a spot in the shelter and prepped my food and worked on gathering firewood to get a fire going. The wood is slim pickings up here. Not much wood to get a long sustaining fire going. I'm the only one at the shelter. I have plenty of me time right now. That's good because I'm tired and will be hitting the sack early.
