Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513157,"HelloI am a soon to be college graduate from metro Detroit, I plan to start my thru hike from Springer Mountians a few days after graduating next April. My current plan is to thru hike NOBO all the way, how ever this will be complicated by two factors. A) My late April start B) the fact that I will be stopping for 2.5 weeks in late July for a trip to Europe that's been in the works for 3 years. Because of these two challenges I will likely end up doing a flip flop to SOBO from Mt. Katahdin after returning from Europe, I will evaluate where I am at that point. I am also considering hiking at least some of the trail with my dog Manny, he is a 30 Lb black lab beagle mix (built like a lab but the size of a beagle). If anyone knows of any thru hike trail journals completed by people with their dogs please let me know. Manny has never been camping over night but has been on plenty of day hikes, so I'm not to sure I want to take him. I will probably try to take him on a weekend hike before it gets to cold.",,Pre Trip 1 About Me and Plans,"Sep 11, Fri",0
Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513158,"I decided to take this trip about 2.5 months ago after a long weekend with some friends backpacking Panther Creek in Georgia, and I have been loosly training ever sense. Over the last couple months I have tried to make time to do at least 15 miles a week with full trail weight. Unfortunately do to the constant chaos of life I have rarely been able to string together more than 3 hours of free time, so the most I have done in a single day is about 6.5 miles. Addtionally the chances of this improving are zero, since school started back up this week. Between a full time job, full time at school, and being the president of two student organizations it is unlikely that free time will do anything but vanish. For training purposes I usually carry 3 gallons of water jugs (24lbs) some blankets (to fill out the pack), full 3L water bladder, and some misc equipment for a total of about a 40 lb pack. I hope to have a pack lighter than this when I hit the trail, though I have not weighed all my gear together yet. I still need to obtain a few items the biggest of which is a new lighter more compact sleeping bag. I have been a camper my whole life although largly a car camper who just made day hikes from a base camp, as such much of my equipment was far to large and bulky for the AT. Over the summer I have purchased quite a bit of new equipment including a new large pack, new stove, hammock rain fly, water filter, cookset, and water bladder. I plan to hammock along the trail in my Enos Double Nest, however if I decide to take Manny with me I will likely get a small 2 two person tent since he is not a fan of the hammock.",,Pre Trip 2 Preperation,"Sep 11, Fri",0

I plan to graduate in April of 2016 and celebrate by taking a trip that hopefully be one of many highlight trips in my life. I have always loved to travel especially in the mountains, there is nothing I love more than a spontaneous road trip. At times I have literally just decided to go on a trip tomorrow, and been on the road without a set destination within 12 hours. I have spent time in pretty much ever state east of the Mississippi with the exceptionion of the states of the North East. Much of this traveling was done while working sports car races all over North America, my main hobby of the last 5-6 years.

This has provided me with endless knowledge and insight into both life on the trail and what to look for in gear and planning.

I have acquired all my major gear with the exception of new sleeping bag, the one I have is simply too bulky and heavy. I have also continued researching, reading many trail journals in my spare time. Haven't really had anytime to spend outdoors with work and school other than a long weekend hammocking in the rain in Georgia last month at a race. It was a really wet weekend but both my new hammock fly and my new hiking boots did great, check out my gear list. Now it's just a long wait for the day to come when I can head south to Springer, I spend most of my free time reading journals or looking at gear, it's a good thing I'm a broke college student I don't even want to think about the mountain of gear I would of bought if I actually had money.

I'm so ready to be done with school and start hiking. Next week is my winter break from school so I'll probably try to do some long walks with my pack, I haven't been very good at keeping up with those since school started back up. I'm also planning on going down to Georgia early next month for my first ""official"" shake down hike, plans are still really loose but probably 2-3 days on or near the AT. Later in April I will probably try to do at least 2 local weekend trips. There is a park only abut an hour from my house that has a 22 mile loop with on trail camping so I'll probably head up there. The only gear I really still need to get is a different sleeping bag and decide on an outer wear coat of some sort. I also haven't made a decision on whether or not to get an outer quilt for my hammock, I usually sleep pretty hot so I'm not sure I'll really need it and I may just wait and make it an on trail decision.

Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521866,"A couple weeks ago I realized my start date is only about 2 months away. With that realization I started trying to wrap my head around the idea that this is actually going to happen, along with the panic that there's still so much get ready. But most of all it made me excited to turn over a new page and start this great adventure. With this realization I also feel I have moved into a new phase of more urgent preparations. Last week I picked up an REI Stratocloud jacket on clearance half off, deals on coldweather gear are great right now because of the warm winter. Review of jacket still to come, but so far I've liked it and it fits into it's on pocket and will double as my pillow.I also have a little more solid plans now to do a shake down hike in early March, planning on just 2 day trip to do the AT approach trail and Amacalola Falls loop about 18 miles total. Hopefully this will give me a better feel for where I am with all the gear I have purchased over the last year and how ready I am for the trail. I'm also considering just continuing to use my old sleeping bag, it's heavy and bulky but I like it and it would save me money not to get a new one. If it becomes an issue on the trail I can pick up a different one, idk still undecided.

Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522803,"Over the weekend I was finally able to sit down with all my gear in one place and pack it all at once. While it all fit into my pack, the fact that this didn't include food brought me to the realization I have been dreading there is no way that I can make my huge car camping sleeping bag work. So I bit the bullet and ordered an REI Igneo Bag it should save me almost 3 lbs and about 10 liters of pack space. My final packed weight was at 32 lbs this weekend which included water but not food, I want to cut down to a base weight of 28 lbs. Next weekend I will head south to do my first official shake down hike. I was hoping to take my dog with me but the weather is looking pretty poor, which will make for good shake down conditions, but I'm not going to make Manny spend a weekend out in the weather. My new sleeping bag should be here Thursday and I will leave the house first thing Friday morning spending the night with some friends before hitting the trail Saturday morning.I had hoped to go for a short hike this weekend, since the weather is really getting pretty decent up here but instead I ended up getting a number of important items crossed off my seemingly endless to do list.

This slight push back in dates will allow me to attend a few family events and also provide me with adequate funding to finish the whole trail.

We got up to Amicalola Falls around 5:30 this evening and hiked together about 1.0 miles from the top of the falls. I already did the hike up the falls when I was down here in the spring so I chose to skip that part of the approach trail today. I am now about 6.5 miles from the start of the actual Appalachian trail and have already setup my site for the night, including hanging my food. I hope to get an early start in the morning with a goal of about 9.3 miles to Stove Creek Shelter, 2.8 miles past the start of the actual AT.

Once again lonely campsite, there was another couple here when I got here but as soon as I showed up they moved to a single site on the other side of the road. Not sure about the road traffic at this site either seems pretty constant and lots of military trucks hope it doesn't keep up all night. Got to talk to all my family tonight though so that's good and have decent cell service.

I have now completed 28.5 miles of the trail. Road traffic kept up all night, had a hard time hanging my food last night too, so I kind of woke up in a crappy mood. But met two guys first thing in the morning who are planning to stay in the same bunkhouse as me tonight so that made me a little happier, but still got off to a pretty late start. Climbed Justus first thing I don't think I'll plan on having climbs to start the day anymore that was a little rough. Crossed paths with the two friends a couple more times once at Justus creek which was a perfect rest spot, stopped and soaked my feet for a bit. Later at Gooch Gap I meet Sott, Jake, and Ben who are also planning to spend the night in Suches. They are hiking the Georgia section of the trail really good guys had with them at the top of Ramrock with a great view. I hiked with them most of the afternoon, and we caught a ride into town with some generous hikers who we had passed earlier in the day they had 3 generations hiking together. Once we got into town we were somewhat disappointed in the store, no beer and the washing machine wasn't working. We ended up getting a couple pizzas and camping at the Biker Campground instead.","Cooper Gap

Had a good but short hike from woody gap to Lance Creek, there was a beautiful view from the top of Preacher Rock. There was a lot of people out today both day and weekend hikers. The parking lot at the trail head was packed and all the campsites here are already full, so I'm set up on a hillside luckily that's not much of an issue since I'm in a hammock.

Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536013,"Had a great day, did 11 miles including Blood Mountain, Neel Gap, and Levelland Mountain. This has been my longest day so far and I felt strong the whole day, I can definitely feel the difference from when I started to now. The views from Blood Mountain were amazing, and the shelter up there was really cool can't imagine what it to build it back in the 1930's. Coming down from Blood I got an awesome pano from one of the lower balds I'll try to post it. Stopped at Neel Gap for awhile to rest and browse ended up buying some new super feet inserts for my boots, thanks to the store employees who helped me make sure I got the perfect ones. I also stuffed my self with multiple hot dogs and a candy bar. I pushed on from there doing another 3.6 to reach Wolf Laurel Top, there's an amazing site up here that has a great view of the mountains I heard about it from Clay at Red River Gorge. After leaving Neel I felt a little bloated but still strong, I haven't been able to find any water since Neel though which has me worried 4 springs in a row have been just mud. I'm a little worried about water I'm down to about half a liter and the next water is at Whitley Gap Shelter 3.1 away but then it's another 1.3 to the shelter, Hog Pen Gap is 3.3 and on the trail so I'll shoot for that in the morning. I'm camped with one other person tonight David I think he's good to hangout with doing big miles on a short vacation from work. As we were eating dinner it started to cloud up and drizzle so we scrambled to put up our flys on the hammocks. Of course it stopped 5 minutes later, not enough to feed the streams that much. Right as we were going to bed another hiker walked up and asked if we knew where Bull Creek was, it wasn't in my guide book but after comparing notes and looking at his map it should be about .5 down the trail from Wolf Laurel so maybe I'll find water early tomorrow after all. Oh yeah I forgot where it fits into the day but sometime this morning I saw what we decided must have been a wild hog, something big and brown got startled a couple hikers ahead of me and we all saw it disappearing into the brush.","Lance Creek

Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535798,"I want to start off by saying thank you to all the service members who have given their lives protecting our freedom. 
I Did 17.6 today including a brutal final 4, but made it to a hotel and good in Helen look for a barrage of posts tomorrow. Thank you everyone for all the guest book posts.
Had a long hard day, it feels good to know that I could push myself so hard, did 17.6 miles lots of elevations at the beginning and the end. Struck out for finding water in the morning, so I started the day in conservation mode summering Cowrock and Wildcat before finally getting water out of trickle of a stream at Hog Pen Gap. It took me half an hour to filter 3 liters because the stream was so low. 
I pushed on over Poor mountain and Sheep Rock Top, stopping for a long break at Low Gap Shelter. Low Gap had a great stream where I stocked up on water and soaked my feet. My left calf is getting a little sore I think it's a combination of breaking in the new shoe inserts and a little dehydration from this morning it's very hot out. I also have a small blister on the upper inside part of my right big toe. I took time at Low Gap to clean my feet, swap insoles back, put moleskin on the blister and powder my feet and shoes. I also talked for a little while to a family from Arkansas that I've been hopping with since I meet them on Big Cedar Mountain, 2 of them are hoping to do the whole trail in 60 days. 
Shortly after Low Gap the trail joins an old dirt road for about 5 miles. This was really nice walking even though the road is completely overgrown it's still makes for flat trail and relatively little elevation (I now consider anything less than 150' of change in a mile flat). Also had a short rain shower that made me put my pack cover on. 
At the Jack Gap Trail the AT splits with the road bed and becomes hell for the last 4 miles to Unichoi Gap. Tons of up and down on rough trail with lots of rock, in some places it was a scramble over old landslides. Climbing 400' in 1.5 over this to the Blue Mountain Shelter was terrible I just went into auto pilot and didn't stop once, I knew if I did it would be impossible to start again. When I finally got to the shelter I found that the water situation up there wasn't good either and I only had 1.5 liters left, I drank half of that while walking off the monster climb I had just finished. I had to decide if I was going on to Unichoi (2.4) or not. I had heard from Ben and Scott who are now headed south bound earlier in the day that they planned to stay at this shelter tonight, but they weren't here yet. After a breather I decided to head out. I had another 200' climb in the next .7 to the summit of Blue Mountain which had 3 false summits where I thought I was at the top only to round a corner and find the trail heading straight up again. At the top of the second false summit I called a few hotels in Hiawasse to see if any of them offered shuttles for guests, one of them gave me a couple numbers of locals they all went to machines. After finally summiting the trail plummets 1100' in 1.5 miles the trail was narrow and rocky I finally got to the bottom around 6:15 collapsing in a pile in a the parking area. There was also magic there as a there was jugs of water left for hikers. 
One of the shuttle guys called me back but the call kept dropping, I was worried I wasn't getting into town after putting in such a big day. About half an hour later the family from Arkansas walked in, and we all drank water and compared notes on how terrible the last section was. A little while later 3 guys came down off of blue who planned on camping at Unichoi. Followed a little later by Scott and Ben from the North side who informed us that the trial on that side of the road is much the same it will start with an 1100' climb in 1.5 miles but that's for another day. For now we were scouring our good books trying everything to find a ride into town. We resorted to trying hitchhiking at the same time. A very evil jeep driver slowed down pulled into the lot stopped waved to us and kept going. Nothing was working then more magic a taxi drove by and we flagged it down. We had tried calling Alpine Taxi out of Helen earlier but just got a voice mail. He already had a fare in the taxi but had room for one so I hopped in, and he said he would come back for the family from Arkansas. Big thanks to Alpine Taxi great service very knowledgable about the town and saved us. He dropped me at the Helendorf Inn, the guide books we had didn't say much about Helen other then a few hotels and Wendy's but it's a great town. Apparently the third most visited town in Georgia it has everything very touristy town reminds me a lot of Frankenmuth back home. 
The hotel room had an actual key, I don't know if I've ever been to a hotel with that. Great service at the Helendorf too I highly recommend both the Helendorf and Alpine taxi. After checking in the family from Arkansas and I went downstairs to the Mexican restaurant below our rooms. We had planned on the German restaurant across the street but they were closed by the time everyone got into town. The Mexican was also very good and we were all very hungry, afterwards I took an amazing shower and went to sleep in a bed.","Wolf laurel Gap

I've also gotten to the point that I'm comfortable enough with my pack to cut the straps down to save some weight. I'm starting to feel really good about where my pack is.

While these breaks do interrupt my progress it allows me to adjust my gear very easily, I have left a lot of gear in Atlanta and have another pile of stuff set aside to dump this time. After a busy day in town yesterday, we all headed to the country store this morning for a shuttle ride back to the trail head. We got to the trail head around 10:45 after spending some time talking to some locals in town. Talking to the locals is one of my favorite things to do, heard some great stories today about the man who made all the AT plaques in Georgia. He made them after completing a thru hiker but was apparently a real character who repaired chainsaws and was known for putting ""whimpy saws"" out their misery by putting a few rounds into them. The day was supposed to involve two big climbs first up Rocky Mountain and then Tray Mountain both are 1100'+ with a similar decent between. I only plan to do 4.4 miles up to Tray Gap halfway up Tray where I was going to get picked up this evening. It was a rough start with the mid heat and humidity really slowing us all down but we made it up Rocky. After stopping for lunch at Indian Grave Gap we headed up Tray with the sound of thunder in the distance we decided to put pack covers on (there is only a 20% chance of rain today). We made it up the to the Cheese Factory site just as it started sprinkling, as we got to Tray Gap it started pouring and I quickly waved to the family from Arkansas as they decided to make a dash for Tray shelter 1.3 ahead. I threw up my hammock fly only getting the center lines up before the sky just opened up with huge drops and almost zero visibility. I crouched under the fly as the rain just pounded down, looking out at the road for the first time I noticed that it was dirt not gravel like I expected and became skeptical that anyone I knew would have a vehicle to make it up there to pick me up today. I had good enough signal to pull up radar and realized it wasn't going to be a quick shower. After a few minutes I decided to try and make the situation a little better and reached out, dragged my pack under the fly to pull out my rain gear. Just as I got it an off-roader in a jeep pulled into the parking area to secure his soft top the rest of the way. He asked if I knew for sure which fork lead down the mountain, I told him I had no idea and asked him if there was anyway he could get me back to the main road. He said sure and I quickly rounded up my soaking wet gear and threw it in the back. It's a good thing I was able to grab the lift down the mountain because the road had really taken a beating with lots of craters and washed out areas it wasn't until we got to the Indian Grave Gap area that the road improved. Even after that there was still areas that were really rutted and right before we got to the main road there was a river raging across the road about 10' wide and probably 1.5-2' deep luckily the big Jeep had no problem. I knew that I definitely would have been stuck with out the lift so big thanks to the Jeep driver and his family who picked me up, sorry I didn't catch your name but definitely Trail Magic Flagging down an off-roader in the middle of nowhere on a Wednesday. As we got to the main road and turned to head back towards Helen the rain finally let up.After getting dropped off in Helen I stuffed my soaked fly into a dry sack and packed everything up heading over to pizza shop to wait. Got picked up by John and got a ride into Atlanta for the weekend. Also I was looking at the camp shoes that family from Arkansas had they're actually Sperry Top-Sider water shoes, I really like them lighter than my sandals and since they're closed toe they can be used on trail in a pinch. I'm going to look at getting a pair while I'm in town. Also heard today that Scott and Ben finished the Georgia section, congrats guys have a safe drive home.","Unichoi Gap

But I felt strong and pushed out 8.7 miles to Deep Gap Shelter, had quite a bit of company in the shelter and a good night of chatting with Cherish, Deisury, Kaitlin, and Paul.

Side note because this will become a story frequently retold later: I went and helped Dex hang her pack on the Bear cable tonight, I was lifting it from below while she pulled the cable and hooked it to the tree. She missed clipping it and the full pack fell from the top of the cable and hit me in the head.","Atlanta

Had trail magic of Ice cold coronas at Dicks Creek Gap, before saying good by to Dez and Cherish who are headed to the top of Georgia Hostel. before pushing on with Kaitlin and Paul. We crossed the border around 4:45 crossing the first state off the list! At the border we were joined by Anon, Brandon and Nipples, after taking the obligatory photos we headed on, I scrambled up the slope to get some pics of the border from above and nearly took an express ride to the bottom of the mountain lucky Paul caught me and I only scrapped up my arm a little. We had been warned by multiple sources that right after the border we would come to a knarled old tree that would signify the beginning of a massive climb. The tree was pretty cool but the climb was nasty 3 individual 500' foot climbs with 200-300' descents in between all in about 1.2 miles. But the view from the top was incredible and eventually we made it to the shelter which was crowded with boyscout troop taking up much of the good sites by the shelter so we ended up setting up on the other side of the trail along the creek. Brandon built a fire and we all had a good time hanging out and eating around the fire. But feels like it's going to long cold night.","Deep Gap Shelter

I really need to figure out some kind of hammock liner to keep my back warm, when I'm laying on my sleeping bag all the down gets compressed and air flow under my hammock freezes me.Paul had the same problem and actually moved up to the shelter during the night. Side note all the shelters in GA had these awesome beat cables which are steel cables suspended from trees for hanging food. We didn't expect them to all disappear in NC but I guess they do, as a result me and Kaitlin were trying to hang bear bags in the dark, Kaitlin showed me a trick of putting a couple rocks in a small bag on the end of your rope and we were able to get a line set on the first throw. We got a really late start because none of us wanted to get out of our sleeping bags me and Paul hit the trail at 9:30 headed for Betty Creek Gap 16.2 miles away. The rest of the group is planning to take a side trail cutting off about 15 miles so that they can get to Franklin sooner. The whole time I've been hiking with Paul he's been saying how he wishes he could have a Botanist and a geologist along to explain things along the trail. Well he got half his wish as we lunched on top of Standing Indian with a SB Boy Scout troop from Florida, two of the troop leaders are geologists and were explaining a lot of the rock formations. The views from Standing Indian were very impressive providing a new view of lake Burton, I've started using the Guthook app as much as the AWOL guide and its definitely worth the cost, but me and Paul came up with the idea that it needs to show a picture naming all the mountains at these overlooks and saying which ones are on the AT. All in all today was pretty easy terrain wise it was just the carry over soreness from Bly Gap yesterday that made it rough. We got into Betty Creek around 7:00 and meet Trapper a section hiker from Georgia headed to the NOC. We got set up near Trapper and walked down to the creek which had awesome flow and was deep enough to soak our feet, me and Paul are both dragging this evening. After watching Trapper try to hang his bear bag for about 10 minutes I walked over with my pack cover and rope to show him Kaitlin's trick, got both our bags hung on the first throws. Afterwards we all sat around eating and talking trapper is a middle school teacher and owns a BBQ joint outside of Atlanta. Sounds like we're going to try and get an early start and hike to Winding Stair Gap together in the morning. Paul is leaving from there to go help his daughter move and so his car is parked there, he said he'll give me and Trapper a ride into town if we want. As we were sitting talking just after dark we realized Paul's hammock was set up under a big widow maker (a dead tree that fell and got hung up in another tree), so we scrambled to move it in the dark a side effect of setting up so tired. It looks like it's going to be another cold night and we have a monster climb up Mount Albert first thing in the AM.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

After a bit of a rest we pushed on making it to Rocky gap around 11:30 where we found a retired sheriff just leaving and he offered us a ride to Paul's car. We gratefully accepted and after getting to Paul's car we all stuffed in and headed to the budget inn where I planned to spend the night. After getting a room we all showered and went to lunch and Kmart, then went back to the inn where we found that Anon, Bookbag, Brandon, and Kaitlin were also staying.

Siler bald is beautiful with nearly 360 views and a sunny pasture on top. It was a grueling climb to get up there and thank you to Dave for the shuttle ride to the trail with out people like you none of us would be able to hike. Everyone made it to the top of the bald early and set up makeshift shade shelters from the blistering sun we then spent the rest of the afternoon hanging out, napping and dragging fire wood up the mountain. We're ready to watch an awesome sunset over the Nantahala River in the distance. There is also a group of engineering students from Georgia tech up here they spent an hour building a shelter out of their hammock rain flys, it actually came out pretty good. Most of our group plans on just cowboy camping under the stars. The sunset was incredible colors, the fire and conversation were amazing and the company was unbeatable. One of the Sams gave a great ode to the night speech, just can't get over how great of a group this is. I also got an amazing timelapse of the sunset, hopefully the sunrise will be just as good.

I got up early and was really motivated so I set out at 7:15 with most of the crew still in their sleeping bags. I definitely didn't want to spend the day hiking alone though so after 5.5 miles I set up my hammock at the Wayah bald tower and took a 2 hour nap. While I was sitting there several day hikers stopped to ask me questions and take pictures of my hammock set up. The stone tower on Wayah bald shelter was very impressive and should definitely be a shelter. Eventually the rest of the crew caught up and we headed on toward Copper Ridge bald where we planned to spend another night unfortunately the bald was less then impressive in that Dez, Dexter, and I didn't even notice we walked past it. So we ended up on Rocky Bald which has another tough climb from the trail to the bald but is worth it with great view of the valley below and trees behind you with tent and hammock sites. We built a fire in the pit on the bald and had another great night of conversation, unfortunately Brandon didn't make it this far he is planning to leave at the NOC to go rafting with friends. But we were joined by Dancing Bear and Magic Hat. Magic hats immense knowledge on the topic of edible mushrooms added greatly to the conversation.

Running down hill with a full pack on a narrow trail sure is an adrenaline rush. Tats was ahead of us the whole day and the last couple miles into the NOC dragged on, when we got into the NOC the three of us tried to get ahold of Tats while we hung out outside he general store. We finally got ahold of her and sorted out housing the group reserved two full bunk houses. We all headed over to the BBQ place to eat some food I devoured a plate of nachos before running to jump in the river to cool off. I should of waited until I was in a little deeper water before I dove in because I ended up with chest full of scratches from the Rocky River bottom. 
There is a hiker kitchen and a grill here so some of the group went into town with a resupply list that included steaks for a cookout tonight. I had them get me two and I'll freeze one to carry to the top of Cheoah tomorrow. Later that evening Dez, tats, one of the SAMs and I were sitting on the rocks soaking our feet and a lady brought us pizza; trail magic!

Had a big climb out of the NOC, 4300' to the top of Cheoh Bald it was a slow start getting everything packed so most of the climb was in the heat of the day. We plan on staying on Cheoh Bald but all met up at Sassafrass Gap Shelter to discuss the plans the weather looks like it could be sketchy this evening. After about an hour of eating and talking we decide to go for it anyways. Dexter and I make it to the top first and meet a new Sam who Dez had been hiking with earlier. The bugs on Cheoh are terrible but the view is pretty impressive. As the rest of the group arrived we all got set up and started cooking. My frozen steak thawed nicely during the day and I cooked it on the fire and passed a piece to everyone on the bald. After eating we all sat by a great fire built by New Sam. Suddenly the wind started picking up and a storm was visible in the distance. The wind really whipped through the site and we all ran around battening down the hatches before taking shelter but after about half an hour it all let up with very little rain.

Allot of the group is having problems with their feet and Leroy ate some bad food last night and was up all night with stomach cramps. We got to the Gap we found magic in the form of Bananas and cold water in a cooler. Dez decided to hitch with the rest of the group, so it was just Dex and I hiking on. I'm definitely starting to feel the trail as well, I rolled my left ankle coming up Cheoah yesterday, it's an old injury that gets agitated on occasion when we stopped at the gap I pulled out my ankle brace. 
The climb out of the gap was the start of Jacobs Ladder 600' in .6 miles. The climb was pretty hard on my ankle, I ended up grabbing a shuttle into town out of Yellow Creek Gap 5.7 miles out of the shelter. In town I grabbed a burger and a couple beers at the tavern. Fontana is a huge tourist resort there are 200 rental cabins in town most of which date back to the work town from the building of the dam. Dexter and Anon are headed into town to resupply and pick up a package at the resort I'm going to ride back to the shelter with them. I also printed my pass for the Smokeys at the resort, in the smokeys thru hikers need to purchase a $20 pass. I picked up my supplies at the general and we headed to the shelter. It's pretty impressive; actual showers, solar charging station, a huge fire pit, and a huge new shelter. It was amazing to get a shower and I washed my clothes in the shower too.

Eventually some of us headed back and ended up swimming in the lagoon, Bookbag and I decided to build a raft out of the drift wood laying around. 
When the rest of the group got back we went down to the lagoon and decided to paddle our raft around the point to see the shelter. It was exhausting but fun.

Luckily we all made it into the shelter just before the skys opened up. Got a very early start with Dez, Dex, and New Sam, we picked up and headed towards Fontana Dam and the smokies. We are somewhat worried that Derrick Knob shelter may be closed due to bear activity. When we got to the entrance to the park we found a bulletin board that confirmed Derrick Knob is closed so we will likely aim for Spence Field instead. 20 minutes into the smokies we saw a bear in the distance, 20 minutes later we saw a cub by the side of the trail. I drifted back from the rest of the group feeling kind of sluggish today. I soon saw a third bear on an opposite hill, so far they have all paid us no mind. 
I went up into a watch tower that had a pretty great view but some of the stairs only had railing on one side and it was pretty windy up there. I had expected to cath up to the group at the watch tower but the side trail wasn't well marked so the my missed it. I would spend the rest of an uneventful day hiking alone about 20 minutes behind the group. When I got to Derrick Knob they were already there along with 5-6 other people. The shelter is a nice stone shelter with two levels of platforms and a large covered area for cooking and congregating.

If we make it to the top before the visitor center closes there is supposed to cold drinks available. I was the first on trail, also hoping to be able to stream at least some of Le Mans today. 
The first minor summit of the day was Rocky Top with incredible 360 deg views. New Sam caught up to me there and set his pack to enjoy the view unfortunately he set it in a pile of poop. People who don't bother to dig a cat hole disgust me especially if your going to poop on top of a mountain where lots of people are stopping. I ended up wasting a lot of the morning trying to get the Rlm feed to work but just didn't have a good enough cell signal and eventually gave up with a lot of the group ahead of me. 
We also meet our first Ridge Runner today she asked a lot of questions about a group of high school football players who came into the shelter late with there coach last night. She wanted to know if we know where they ended up staying since the shelter was full, sounds like the caused some problems with having an overloaded permit, not staying at shelters, and leaving trash behind them.
All day the group was flipping over each other the hiker hunger is starting to hit hard and we all made a lot of snack stops. Water was also sparse in some stretches. But there was an incredible point where the forest changed from all deciduous trees to all pines it was literally walking around a corner it changed over completely and the pine forest was incredibly green with mosses. It was an absolutely amazing sight that stopped me in my tracks.
Eventually though we all made it to the top and I found New Sam headed down from the visitor center who told me that there were no cold drinks, I refused to believe it and had to check for myself. But sure enough no cold drinks or cheap snacks gradually the group all arrived and we all gathered in the grass at theedge of the parking lot, the view is incredible but spirits are still low with no drinks. Plus the drive up view always takes a little away from the view, there's so many day hikers and tourists it's a little overwhelming.
We also met Finder a hiker from out west he shared some pickles with us that he had bought at the visitor center. We also got incredible Magic a man walked up and asked if anyone wanted cold drinks, he had a cooler full of pop and water on ice, amazing!!
As it got closer to the sunset we all went up to the tower to check out the view and scout out campsites. The view from the tower is incredible and we decided we would spend the night up there to enjoy the sunrise as well, we set up our stuff at the base of the tower cooking dinner.

Half an hour after I dumped the water the fire flared right back up again. Curly Q dropped off his pack last night and then disappeared back into town, there is no sign of him or Tats this morning so we hide it and Finder is going to tell them where to find it when he goes into town for his package.Me and Srgnt Pepper set out hiking together at the Lovers Leap we stopped to soak in the view of Hot Springs, and brush our teeth. Srgnt Pepper set his pack right near the edge of the cliff and I immediately commented that it was a brave place to put it, about 30 seconds later the open pack was at the bottom of a 40' cliff with a debris field of gear trailing behind it. If you can't laugh in that moment you won't survive the AT, and we definitely laughed for a while. Finally we made or way down the trail and scrambled over a rock field to retrieve items. The pack was more difficult to retrieve having to scramble around some trees and further down the slope but I was able to get down there with some para cord and work the pack up to slope while Sam pulled pulled and scrambled from above. At together we lost about 30-45 minutes and most of the items were recovered undamaged. We continued on and got to the top of the initial climb right around mid day after which it levels out a bit and there is a dammed creek that makes for a smelly pond. As me and Srgnt. Pepper skirted the pond I suddenly stopped in my tracks almost stepping on a massive rat snake in the long grass resulting in several expletives of surprise. As we kept climbing we moved through pockets of freshly charred forest from fires earlier this year. It was clear that many of these sections of trail had been completely rebuilt since the fire, incredible work by local trail crews thanks to all who are involved in maintaining the AT. At a side trail to the Rich Mountain Observation Tower we found a note Scout Master and Yukon saying the Village was lunching in the tower, part way up we found Dex and Dez headed back down. At the top we found the tower and a gravel road with some sight seers up parked up there. Srgnt Pepper and I headed up into a rickety looking watch tower with holes in the floor the size soccer balls. The view from the top was incredible and we found Scout Master and Yukon were sprawled out on the floor eating. Including a pie Scout Master had carried up there, Srgnt Pepper and I joined them it was a pretty hot day especially when we were hiking through the burned out section without any tree cover.We hoped that Tats and Curly Q would catch up with us but after about an hour we all moved on. Now out of the burn zone we moved through green forests. I was in the lead with Srgnt Pepper about 10-15 seconds behind me on the trail as we came over a small rise we both commented on a nice campsite off to the right. Suddenly there was a loud crack and I spun around to see what happened but Srgnt Pepper just shrugged, immediately followed by half a tree crashing to the ground right between us. Scout Master and Yukon yelled from behind to find out what happened. We soon got to Spring Mountain shelter and stopped to rest and talk with Dex and Dez we were also joined by Teddy a section hiker from Florida. Dex and Dez moved on while the four of us decided to stay and cook food, possibly for the night. Scout Master pulled out a cantaloupe that he cut up with his machete and passed around. We also cooked several courses of food as a group resulting in an awesome potluck. We were soon joined by Teddy's friend Kate and Otter. The shelter is definitely old and run down and the privey leaves quite a bit to be desired nearly overflowing and a stall to small close the door. So we all decided to stay at some one of the campsites near the shelter. Scout Master of course built a big fire and we were joined by the other people we had meet as well as mayhem and a SOBO. The SOBO warned us that a lot of the water sources ahead are dried up. Curly Q and Tats never showed up but late in the day a rare moment of LTE resulted in a small group of photo messages from Curly Q showing a truck in a ditch with Cherish in the backseat.

As we moved in the trail dropped off the ridge line for a bit and found blueberries that we spent a few minutes picking. The trail then came back up to the top of the ridge line and we found a completely different sight with storms moving in quickly, we were still 3 miles from the shelter so we started moving fast. It was a rock scramble following the ridge for about a mile the storm rumbled behind us the whole time including one point when the clouds hit the mountain and shot up over our heads.The last 2 days I've been listening to the Le Mans podcast on my phone and finished it about 15 minutes out of the shelter, wow that's all I can say.

Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541327,"6/29Everyone moving slow out of the shelter this morning Teddy and I headed our first soon passing some trail crews .5 out of the shelter, thanks to all the volunteers who maintain this trail. Dez decided to wait at Sam's Gap for Dexter while the rest of us moved on.We found incredible views on top of Big Bald, and the village decided to just hang until the sunsets and night hike another 6.Me and scout master went ahead for water while Yukon and Srgnt pepper cooked lunch. Teddy moved on she wants to meet Kate tomorrow in Erwin and be fresh to hang out with her. Dez sent random photo of her and baby deer while she waits for Dex at SAMs gap. It's absolutely beautiful up here the best view we've had on the trail yet, how could life get better than this freedom. We set up a tent fort to block some of the wind and started to cook food, we're soon joined by Mayhem, Nepala, Dex and Dez. Dez brought news that Curly Q and Tats hitched into Erwin trying to catch up with us, also Tats will be getting off the trail due to a family emergency. Looks like we're all spending the night up here to many rounds of food to move on. The sunset was absolutely beautiful and I got the best time lapse yet. The stars were also incredible we could see so many of them and off in the distance was a heat lightening storm. We all stayed up late into the night talking and playing games, before 5 of us crammed into the tent fort for a cold night on the mountain.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541328,"6/30It was actually surprisingly warm in the tent fort last night with so many people huddled together. Some of us decided to try and hitch into Erwin to get there before the all you can eat pizza ended the group included Scout Master Norris, Nepala, Mayhem, Srgnt Pepper, Yukon, and myself.The dirt road and parking lot on top of the mountain actually leads to a private summer resort not a main road. After walking about 4 miles we found or selves in a very high end resort with a private golf course, riding stables, ski runs, and more. It was clear by their looks that many of the residents weren't thrilled to see hiker trash walking around. Prospects for a hitch were looking pretty bleak especially when we found out it was another 4 miles just to the front gate of the property. Luckily one of the suspicious residents called security on us and a very nice guard named John ended up giving us a ride all the way into Erwin. John is a local and an awesome guy who gave up an hour of his time just to drive us into town we can't thank you enough.We also made it into town in time for the all you can eat pizza, and a pizza eating competition quickly ensued. Later we grabbed a shuttle to Uncle Johnnys after consuming 15 slices, 5 pieces of bread, and a large salad. Also me and Scout Master are planning to carry a duck out of Erwin. After getting set up at Uncle Johnnys and taking an amazing shower, Dex and Dez showed up and we all caught the dinner shuttle into town for Mexican. At dinner the village was joined by Leafs and Trips two teachers from Denver who are section hiking. After dinner we checked out Walmart, no duck. Cherish leaves at 1 tomorrow it will be sad to see her go. Most of the camp stayed up late drinking and watch movies on the front porch. Uncle Johnny really does have a great set up here.","Big Bald

Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541329,"7/1Went to Huddle Bouse for breakfast with the village and caught the shuttle back to the hostel. Roll aides, Dancin Bear, and Kevin made surprise visit Kevin is back from Florida and he brought his car with him. They are staying at standing Bear with Bookbag and magic Hat.We all said goodbye to Tats as we headed into town for lunch and resupply. Hit ayce pizza again after feast shopping with Yukon. Tonight's feast will include 6 lbs of Ribs, 5lbs of potatoes, corn, cheddar broccoli soup, fruit, and brownies cooked on the mountian.Back at the hostel we did laundry in the river and packed up all our gear. As I headed out on the trail ahead of everyone I saw a deer near the railroad tracks.Definitely felt those ribs coming up the mountain but was a good climb with lots of stream crossings many with actual fish in them. A Sobo reports no water at shelter so I loaded up about a mile before hand. Got to the shelter and found a good source. There was a section hiking couple Thurston and Shauna at the shelter who were wide eyed as we unpacked our feast. The ribs were amazing and so were the brownies. The feast was awesome, and the village had great team work getting all the food cooked.","Erwin, Tenn.

Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541330,"7/2 Stuffed from the feast got a late start, we hit the trail around 9:30. Packed up and headed up and up and up, lots of climbing early. Planning on a 17 today and a 19 tomorrow to spend the night in the barn Yukon saw 2 bears this morning within 20 minutes. Headed to iron gap this evening to meet Scout Masters cousin tonight. Hot day Kicked it into beast mode on 1800' climb, and promptly rolled my ankle hard on the way down. Dez and Dex moved on to the next shelter doing a 22 along with Mayhem. Nepala is having lots of foot problems again and is staying at Chery Gap Shelter, I fear we are seeing her for the last time.Sam squared are thinking about staying on all the way to demascus and just picking up SAMs brother in Hampton. Tri-SAMs, Yukon, and myself were waiting for Scout Master Norris's cousin on the side of the road and two awesome locals just stopped and gave us cold water and let us play with their dogsPlans to get home for my trip to Europe are starting to take shape, Scout Master will be off to boot camp soon and Yukon is going home for a friends wedding. Scout Master is getting picked up on the 10th probably in Damascus by his brother and going to Atlanta for a few days before heading home. So Yukon and I are going to tag along and crash at my friends house for a couple days before grabbing a bus to our destinations. Scout Master will be off to boot camp soon and Yukon is going home for a friends wedding.SAMs cousin arrives around 9:00 with her two dogs and beer, but she didn't stop to get food wanting to find the random road side crossing while it was still light out. She asks if we want to ride into town for food, obviously the answer is yes so we stash our packs in the bushes and cram 6 people and 2 dogs into her Prius. Of course on the way into Erwin there is a police checkpoint and we have to many people in the car, but luckily the cops were cool and just laughed it off letting us head into town. The only place we could find open at 10:15 was the Little Caesers so we sat on the curb and destroyed 3 hot and readys, 2 bags of crazy bread, 1 Italian cheese bread, and a 2 Liter. Laura is super cool she SOBO'd the upper 900 miles a couple years ago and has about 300 miles of the south end sectioned together now. We got back to the trail around 11:30 PM passing through the checkpoint again without incident. The 1.3 mile night hike to our campsite went off with out incident there is one other tent set up, I believe it is Ross (Tinkiwinkys) who I had meet the night before.","Curly Mountain Shelter

Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541017,"7/3 Late lazy start didn't go to bed until almost 2 am Laura is cool, lots of awesome trail stories and the stars were amazing. We're headed for the barn. 2 miles into the day I found zig zag asleep in his hammock he couldn't find us last night. when we got to the first shelter i found Dez, Dex, and Mayhem still there. Finigan took off and we all searched for a little while but Laura parted ways with us to go find him. We think he just got disoriented and went the wrong way down the trail. We made slow progress and on top of ------ summit we all chilled, Dex Dez, and Ross caught up, and we got word that finigan had been found and Laura was headed back to the group. We chilled for a while but eventually moved on. At the gap before Roan we found Leafs and Trip, Trip had fallen and was nursing a sore knee looking for a hitch to the top. Yukon, scout master and I sat to chat with them for awhile and Trip found a hitch to the top. The assent was not terribly steep but the switch backs were definitely over kill it took forever to get to the top. 1.6 below the summit the whole village minus curly q who no one had seen since like 11:30 congregated for snacks. At the top we found the site of the old hotel, built in the early 1900's it was only open for about 20 years and was accessed by small gauge rail. The building was situated on the state line providing the main banquet hall with the interesting feature being half in a dry state, resulting in a line being painted down the center of the room and through the main dining table delineating where you could drink alcohol. After 20 years the building was disassembled and sold off in pieces leaving just an empty field and a few fireplaces standing today.We also found Leafs who had hiked up on her own after Trip hitched, she informed us of the wild strawberries in the field, yum. There was also an actual bathroom. Ross said he had seen Curly Q, he went up to the Roan Shelter to take a nap, still no sign of Laura though. Most of us are considering calling it a day at Roan this has just been one of those days where it feels like absolutely no progress is being made. Plus Scout Master, Yukon and I are in no hurry only having to make it to Damascus by the 10thAt the shelter I found Sam Squared, Zigzag, Trip, and Leaves. We were soon joined by Yukon and thoughts turned to the fourth tomorrow and how we could celebrate. It was decided that we should do a feast at the barn and the are several balds near by that should provide a view of fireworks in a neighboring town. We quickly put together a list and Sam Squared and Zig Zag headed back to the parking lot to hitch into town. They hope to make it back tonight but I'm skeptical it's already 6:30 and hitching in is easy finding someone to bring you back is not. Scout Master is of course is working on a fire while me and Yukon cook food. Mayhem is near by looking at the guide book he is still shooting for the Barn tonight. We soon had a good fire going and good conversation with Trip and Leaves joining us. Laura must have missed our note and kept going to the barn.This is the highest shelter on the AT so it promises to be a cold night and there looks to be a storm rolling in. The shelter is also the first I've seen that is actually fully enclosed with four walls and a front door, no fire place though. Eventually it starts to sprinkle so Scout Master Yukon and I head to bed in the second floor of the shelter while Trip and Leaves head to their tent. Pretty soon the rain started coming down really hard on the tin roof of the shelter. Around 12:30 we are all surprisingly woken up by the Scouting party returning from their supply run. sounds like they had a very exciting town run and are all very soaked after a ride up the mountain in the back of a pickup truck. But they promise that a great feast is on hand that will challenge the villages cooking ingenuity like never before now we just have to carry it to the barn.","Unnamed campsite

Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541019,"7/4 Late start everyone wet and sleepy from last night storms and adventures. Took 3 attempts but got a fire going for everyone to dry gear out. The food run looks to have been a major success, now we just have to carry it 7 miles to overlook shelter. The group had carried it on a stick last night and so I just made up a better straight stick this morning, but Scout Master insisted he would just strap it to his pack. Right as scout master and I were about to leave Laura walked up with the dogs. So we hung out for a while talking, looks like zigzag is going to adopt Finigan. Me and Sam eventually moved on at 12:30 and we soon saw Nepala who is having increased foot problems and is looking to get off the trail for awhile. As we went down Roan and got to the scenic over look area it was crazy how many tourists and day hikers were out. The views there were pretty good, but at is point in my hike people being able to drive up to a view takes away from it somehow busting my ass on a climb makes an awesome view just that much more rewarding. It was also a drastic transition where the AT split off the main tourist scenic trail the trail went from a well maintained gravel path to a somewhat over grown rut. We saw Trip and Leafs at --- shelter and stopped for a quick snack with them. Clouds started rolling in though so Scout Master and I started booking it the last 3 miles to the barn, but after a short sprinkle the skies cleared up. we made it to the barn which has an awesome view of the mountains. The privy looks pretty new but has no roof or door, which would be perfectly fine if the trade off was a view of the mountains but there are bushes in the way. Scout master and I set about preparing to cook the feast and were soon joined by Leafs, Trip, and Yukon. Also found mayhem sleeping in the barn loft with a sore back and allergies acting up, he plans on moving up to the hump bald soon. Took me a bit to find the good water source but there is good flow out of a piped spring. After awhile we had most of the group collected and the cooking commenced, it was a great night with burgers, brats, and apple Pie that scout master glazed with a camp stove. We also got a view of some fireworks in the valley while we sat and played cards late into the night.","Roan Mountain Shelter

Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541020,"7/5 Planning an 18 today but woke up to a rainy morning at the barn. took awhile to pack up as everyone's gear got scattered hamhazardly in last nights activities. Ripped my pants on a screw sticking out of the platform and it started to rain while I was on the privy. Scout Master and I finally set off and had some amazing views from the Humps, the clouds were rolling in and out making for many false summits but once we finally got to the top the view cleared and was incredible reminded me of what New Zealand looks like. For the descent into Roan Mountain a part of the village all hiked together with music playing on my phone, made for a fun hike even though we got completely turned around at a campsite with 4 trails branching out of it. Once we found the trail again the forest was incredibly green and mystical looking with the fog and old growth trees. The trail was very wet and slippery from the rains with mud and wet roots, I would have smashed my face so many times if it wasn't for my trekking poles. Finally about 2 miles from the road the trail dried out a little to make for easier walking which of course resulted in me falling twice in 10 minutes, which resulted in a lot of laughter. If you can't laugh at the bad on the trail, you'll never survive. We finally made it to the road and hiked the .3 to the hostel hopping to get a hot pizza for lunch before moving on, unfortunately we found a limited selection and ended up hitching into town for food and supplies. Zig zag arrived with the news that he forgot his wallet at Roan Mountain shelter. Met an awesome couple known as Huff and Puff at Dollar General who gave us a lift to the pizza place. The SAMs, Yukon, Mayhem, and I all enjoyed pizza. Sam squared and mayhem are going to hitch to Hampton so that they can met Curly Q's mom and brother tomorrow, Scout Master, Yukon, and I are headed back to the hostel to get our gear and possibly join them. We hitched backed to the hostel and found Leafs, Trip and Zig zag headed into town. After sitting for awhile we decided to just tent at the hostel for a movie night and hitch to Hampton in the morning. Took an awesome shower and we settled into cooking and vegging out with Trip, Leafs, and ZigZag. We watched Enemy of the State and Jurassic Park before heading off to bed around 11:30.","Over Mountain Shelter

Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541023,"7/6 Wish I had put a little more effort into setting up my rain fly last night as I woke up to a downpour and my fly was quite covering my hammock. Didn't get too wet just dropped on but after half an hour I finally just made a dash for the hostel with my pack, leaving my fly set up. Found everyone vegging out watching the end of Jurassic Park so I joined right in. Around 12 the rain had stopped and we packed up to head out Trips is going to join us now and Zigzag plans to hitch to Hampton this afternoon, while Leafs heads back on the trail. Took us a bit but we did find a ride from a local named Charles, he only planned on dropping us in Roan but ended up just driving us all the way to Hampton. So many awesome people like him and the couple last night contribute to making a thru hike possible. In town we stopped at Dunken Donuts where we meet the Fairy Snack Mother who's husband and daughter are on the trail.

Chief 1600's,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542654,"Well I've been home for about a week now, it has been a difficult adjustment back to the real world. I'm happy to be home and to see my family but I really miss the trail. Theres so many people, and just a total different atmosphere in terms of how people interact. Most of all I'm just going stir crazy just sitting in one place for a whole week. But I leave for Europe on Wednesday so hopefully that will lessen the restlessness. It was great to get to do a real tear down of my pack complete with cleaning all my gear. I've been keeping up with the village as much as possible and trying to lock in plans to get back on the trail when I get back from Europe. Hoping to pick up a lot of the village and be back on trail at Katahdin by August 6th.","Home
