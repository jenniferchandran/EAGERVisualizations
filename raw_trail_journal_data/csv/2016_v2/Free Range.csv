There are a lot of details to tend to when planning a trip this long. Getting work covered for 2 jobs, paying bills, making sure there is food for kids and pets, emergency contact friends available........ I can't imagine what my sister had to do - her trip is much longer than mine! Needless to say I am getting there! I've had 2 fattening up dinners with friends, training hikes and lots of support from my church family and friends. I can't wait to start!
Since I was so excited to start I decided to put the 1st picture of Insect and I heading to the trail head in Fontana Dam. This is us leaving the hotel in Robinsville, NC.",,2 DAYS AND COUNTING,"Nov 08, Tue",0
Free Range,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552341,Today is the day! Left home with the kids and dog. The 3.37 hour drive took 5.5 hours. Sat on I-40 outside of Ashville because of the forest fires on the trail. We got into Robinsville and was quite smokey. Meeting up with my sister was great! Finally ready to start my trailcation - yay! Spent the night in Robinsville and will head to Fontana Dam in the morning.,"

Free Range,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552343,"The kids drove us to Fontana Dam, we walked around it and it is huge! No water running, there is a drought here now. We heard the person that started the fires was caught. Apparently this person was hanging tires in trees and burning them so it would be a while before the melted tire would hit the ground and said person would be away from the area. Why, why would someone do that? This is all what we heard and details of this tragedy are not confirmed at this point.We said goodbye to the kids and Maddie (dog) and hit the trail late morning. Within an hour I shed 2 layers of clothes. People back home were worried about me being cold - not so during the day! It was nice and sunny, only a little smokey.We hiked up out of Fontana Dam - approximately 2,000 feet. We met up with several hikers my sister (Insect) has hiked with off and on through out the whole trail. Sailor Moon, the Librarian, Piece by Piece and another guy she didn't know that we referred to as Eagle Scout - just cuz he said he was an eagle scout. Beautiful trail, funny looking trees, so many red leaves on the ground it looked like the red carpet....We are at Cable Gap Shelter - nice shelter (even has a privy - yes I very much appreciate that!) It is now 6:25 pm we've had dinner, hung up our food and are ready for bed - it's dark already......we are being serenaded by great horned owls.....7.1 miles today.","Fontana Dam

It's bow hunting season for bears - had quite a few ""puppies"" visit the shelter this morning. They wear tracker collars and tree the bear then the hunters go to the dog's once the tracking device shows they are not travelling anymore. Don't like it myself but it is a sport.....Anyways, we lounged around a bit before we hit the trail. Nice day, a little smokey in parts. We have to catch a shuttle in the morning at Stecoah Gap and go into Franklin, NC. 40 miles of the trail is now closed due to the fires. Sad, just so sad. Hopefully it will re-open next year and we will be able to hike it.We saw quite a few SOBO's fast hiking since they are near the end. We let them pass. I'm a little slow over the rocks. Now at the shelter getting ready for dinner chatting with 2 brother's that are hammocking - funny guys. I am quite hungry so will sign off and it will be dark soon.","Cable Gap Shelter

We are in Franklin, NC at the Gooder Grove Hosetl, currently the only guests. There is the owner ""Zen"" and ""Beast"" who is working for stay and us. Nice place. We arrived around lunch time, borrowed some clothes (it is common for hostels to have loaner clothes for hikers) so ours could get washed and walked to town. We ate in a very cool restaurant - 50's style, went to the grocery store to get dinner and breakfast items, we have full use of the kitchen, took a long shower and a long nap! It was nice to sleep in a bed","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

Free Range,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552346,"It is now noon. We've had breakfast, decided to go to another hostel in Hiawasee GA for tomorrow night, secured our ride and have a plan for 3 days to Helen, GA. It is a very cool German town - I highly recommend visiting if you have a chance to. Still in loaner clothes - will walk into town later.It's later.....we walked into town even tho Zen said it was a code purple day - which apparently means bad smoke day, stay inside. We wandered around town in borrowed shirts, we put on our hiking shorts and leggins so we looked a bit more normal, I thought anyways. First we went to the Outdoor 76 store & bought a pillow for me (I actually wrenched my back after 2 nights of shelter sleeping with no pillow) and a map that has the Benton MacKaye trail on it. This trail intersects with the AT in GA. Chatted with people in the store about the trail. People find it very cool that my sister is a SOBO and that I joined her for the last leg of the journey. SOBO simply means south bounder.Next we wandered around town, had lunch in the Frogtown deli, very good food, and wandered around a used bookstore. One thing about it getting dark so early is that it makes for a long night. We decided we needed a book to read to help pass the time. And it is to only be read on the trail...After all that we stopped in a local coffee/yogurt shop (odd & very popular) for coffee. So, there we were, just sipping coffee, playing the peg triangle game when a gentleman said ""HI, I'm from the local newspaper and I heard there were some AT hikers in town and figured it was the 2 of you. Can I interview you?"" Well of course you can, Dennis from the local paper! We were famous for a moment - people about town talking about us - WOW! Dennis asked about the logistics of getting around the fires and what we thought about them, where were we staying, things like that. I wonder what gave it away that we were the displaced hikers? The odd, mis-matched clothing? Crocs? Baseball caps? We finished the interview and came back to the cozy hostel and are now back in loaner jammies and fixing pancakes for dinner - yumm! Tomorrow Zen will drive is to the next hostel. We will stay one night and get back on the trail. This also means our ""tail only"" books we bought today cannot be started for 2 more days!!!!","Gooder Grove Hostel

It is a half mile from Dicks Creek Gap where we will get back on the trail......Well, our stay here was short. We were evacuated to the town of Hiawasee, the fire was 3.5 miles from the hostel. The owners decided to do a voluntary evac. Better safe than sorry. The owners drove us into town.

I was down to shorts and t-shirt within an hour. Took some pics along the way. Had lunch overlooking a vista on Powell Mountain. Got up from lunch and had to do some pack repair - the piece between the shoulder straps on the back broke - oops! Good thinking by my sister, the experienced hiker - she repaired it in no time with duct tape of course Went back to hiking. Hiked along for a while - la, la, la - then - SPLAT! I tripped over a rock. All is well, my first trail scar - woot! Good thing I'm not shaving my legs for a while - hahahaha.We are at the shelter now, the sun is getting ready to go behind the mountain so I predict we will be in jackets and many layers soon!

I think there were some giant rocks of marble popping out of the earth. I need to check into that. It was very pretty rock and looked like marble.Insect and I were wondering if we would see some people today and we did! 3 and a dog. The 2nd person we saw was a hiker named Marshall. My sister has hiked with him off and on through out her journey. It is pretty cool to see people that shout out ""Insect! How's it going?"" She has had quite a trip! Marshall did confess that he & fellow hikers thought maybe Insect didn't like her little sister and that was why I was on the trail, to get back at me or something - funny people - it was my idea to join her! A great adventure with my sis - how awesome is that? I am so glad I am able to do this! Even if I did get slightly annoyed at the never ending uphill climb today! All is good tho - time for dinner, sunset and reading by headlamp.

It was very, very windy and cold! I was warm and snug in my sleeping bag in the shelter. One thing with all that wind I didn't hear any owls I am getting used to hearing them....It didn't stop the dark eyed juncos in the morning though! We watched them flit around while we had our coffee. We were up & on our way by 9 am. Depending on which side of the mountain we were on it was either windy & cold or sunny & not so windy. We had lunch on the non-windy side. Good thing - we had a beautiful view while dining. Then in was cold again. Insect says I am getting my hiker legs. Going up is no problem - going down, well, not so much. I am getting more confident as the days go by.We are now in Helen. We need to restock our food. Helen is just a very cool German tourist town. When we checked into the hotel the front desk person was so amazed that Insect has hiked the whole trail and that I joined her that she made us a fresh pot of coffee and gave us each a yogurt and cinnamon bun. We wandered around the town - it is all decorated for Christmas. Very pretty. Had dinner at the Troll House Tavern - good food and there is a stream that runs through town along the restaurant. Tomorrow we are getting picked up at 9 am - early to bed tonight! Today we were on Tray Mountain & Rocky Mountain. Went through Tray Gap/The Cheese Site/Indian Grave Gap (yes, grave) and Unicoi Gap.","Tray Mountain Shelter

It took a while for my fingers and toes to warm up. The day did get warmer and soon I was taking off layers - not my thermoball jacket though! Well, not till mid afternoon and not for long. The day was very pretty and had some great views along the way. This is the longest hike day for me so far. My feet do hurt some. We are in a hostel tonight and tomorrow. I will admit I was beginning to think my sister and I were the only females on the trail. Lo and behold 2 hikers came into the hostel and one of them was a girl! She was happy to see 2 other girls also.This hostel is different than the last hostel. This is connected with the store next to it and has a room with 14 bunks, a kitchen area, lounging area and shower. A nice hot shower!

I just love hearing the stories of the people they catch up on when they get together. They really are their own family or tramily is what they call themselves.Let's see - slept off and on this morning. Had an awful headache. At first I thought it was because I didn't have my usual amount of coffee yesterday. More likely it was from hiking in the wind and cold and not drinking enough water. I'm fine now. RE-hydrated and rested. Pizza and klondike bars for dinner. Don't you just love what we eat?I did walk up and down 2 sets of stairs 3 times today to get from the hostel to the store. Mostly I just lounged in my sleeping bag on my bunk. 3 other hikers are here, yes, one is a girl! One Piece. She has been sleeping with a grapefruit for 2 nights so it wouldn't freeze. Funny.My phone is dead, dead. It was kind of working this morning but when I went to charge it - nothing.....Good thing my sisiter's is working I'm due for a new one anyways. Not much else to report.

We sang the Flintstones song for a while - walking over bed rock - get it? Haha. There were many day hikers going up and a couple on the way down the other side. Blood Mountain shelter is so cool! I could live there - built of stones, 2 rooms and a huge fireplace - very nice! We are not staying in this shelter - just visiting it.
