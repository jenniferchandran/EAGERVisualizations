Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501714,"Almost exactly 9 months ago my best friend told me she planned to hike the entire AT in about 1.5 yrs: which meant early 2016. She said she realized I probably couldn't get off 4-6 months for the trip, but wanted to know if I could plan to meet her and hike for a couple of days. I immediately concurred with her assumption that I couldn't hike the whole thing, but I was excited about the possibility of spending a week or two with her. Now, fast forward 9 months and the decision has been made for me to thru-hike with her after all! The road to this decision was quite complicated, but I am thrilled with the outcome, one that I just committed to it in the last 48 hours. I have already thrown myself into detailed lists and planning, which is quite exciting. 
I have spent 98% of my life following everybody else's rules and expectations: my parents', my teachers', my friends'. It has only been in the last 1-1.5 yrs that I've had the courage to break that mold and do what I want to do. 
In this case I want to completely escape from the daily demands and responsibilities projected onto me by everyone around me. I want to disconnect from social media, technology, my friends, and even my family. I want to fall off the grid and simply coexist with Christ in Christ's creation alongside one of the most important people in the world to me. It shall be epic and unforgettable.I am super excited about the new adventures we will have and no words can describe what it will be like to spend this much time with her again!",,Guess What I'm Doing,"Jun 21, Sun",0
Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501801,"Almost immediately after deciding that a thru-hike was definitely happening I also decided that my Malamute/Australian Shepherd mix Panda has to come too. I've had her since she was 6 weeks old and she turns 7 yrs old in January 2016. She has been my companion for trips 10 hrs home to South Alabama and 13 hours southwest to Humble, TX. She adores being outside with me and our favorite things to do in Kentucky include hiking at Land Between the Lakes and and playing in Clark's River.Once I cleared her addition with Kimmy I started adding dog gear to my list of supplies. Now that I've started researching high-quality gear I know that bringing her is going to add expenses larger than I originally thought. That does not deter me in the least, she is totally worth it. However, it does mean that I have to start finding sponsorships ASAP. I filled out two online Donation request forms for Ruffwear and Backcountry K-9. Over the next couple of weeks I will be researching other needed supplies and companies.",,The Search Begins,"Jun 22, Mon",0
Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501915,"I've always had a touch of OCD, usually pertaining to things like all the books on the book shelf facing the same direction, all the pictures on my walls being symmetrical, and having to read whatever sentence or billboard I've started and can't stop until I've read the whole thing. Here recently I've started more down the 'O' track of obsessing about this trip because it's been almost all I've been able to think about the last few days.I'm thinking about gear lists, sponsors, number of miles we may hike each day, gear I want to take, but don't know if its worth the weight. Heck, I'm even thinking about who is going to fit into the very, very, very small number of friends and family I want to stay in contact with during the trip and which books I want to haul around to read. Honestly, I'm not even sure this whole option to have Preparation journal entries is a good idea, lol. I foresee the possibility of many silly, odd, and possibly unimportant entries. Not to say that I won't post important things such as those previously mentioned lists and information about our plans, just that I have some OCD and some ADHD and some other random variations of capital letters so don't always read my posts looking for deep, intellectual insight or wisdom.",,OCD on a New Level,"Jun 23, Tue",0
Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503954,"5 months from now Kimmy and I can get our thru-hiker tags. 7 months from now we can get our permits to hike the Smokies. It's just over 8 months until we hike out NOBO. It seems like so far away and yet so close! 
Still so much prep work to be done, but I feel like that will keep flying by. I try to be organized. I love graphs and charts and columns. I love making checklists and marking things off so I'm making great headway in my preparation. I have extensive, comprehensive lists now: gear for myself, gear for Panda, sponsors and donors I have contacted, sponsor responses, sponsors to still contact, bills to pay before I leave so I have somewhere to come back to etc. Now it's time to make lists for drop boxes and places I know I want to have zero days at. Time for a list of important information concerning my house and other animals while I'm out on the trail and a list for the few I need to give it to before I leave. 
Kimmy and I have agreed we will need the first week or two to acclimate to the trail and get to a fairly consistent number of miles each day. We've agreed to go at our own pace according to how we feel instead of rushing it. Our permit for the Smokies is the only real deadline we have, except reaching Katahdin in October, but I'm not worried about that one at all.
Kimmy and I have begun planning a 3-5 day backpacking trip in January, less than 6 months from now, as a test run. Gear will be altered and supplemented as needed afterwards and I'm sure some lists will change, but I anticipate most of our prep work being done by then.

However, my energy level took a flying leap when I found a package on my doorstep. It was from my first sponsor: Ruffwear! I opened it immediately, expecting just the collapsible bowls agreed upon, but I was very excited to find the bowls and a trucker hat with their name on it and 4 stickers. For those of you who may not know me very well yet, I love baseball caps and beanies! And I love that they surprised me with it without even knowing that piece of information about me! I had been contemplating which hats and beanies to take on the trip with me and Ruffwear just made that decision much simpler! Now I need to decide on a water bottle and which journals I'm taking to put the stickers on!Bravo Ruffwear, for the support and for ending my day on such a positive note!

Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504572,"For most of the last 2 yrs I was waking up at 6:30a and going to bed between 9 & 10p.In the last month however, I have changed jobs and am settling pretty quickly into a second shift routine. I'm finding now that 10p has become my favorite time of day/night. The night before last I received my first sponsor package when I got home after work. Last night, per routine, I got off work and turned on the radio to go home. The radio is always set on the last station I was listening to before work, which flip flops between Christian, country, and some R&B. This time Kenny Chesney was crooning out his latest hit: Wild Child. I sang along to my favorite tune. It has only been on the radio for a few weeks, but I already know most of it word for word.

Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507406,"One of the first questions posed to thru-hikers is why? Why leave ""normal"" life to live out of a backpack and hike all day every day for 5-6 months? After reading many other blogs and trail journals and hearing stories of other thru-hikers, I've come across a variety of answers to this question, and come to the conclusion that most people have a primary reason followed by multiple secondary reasons. My decision to thru-hike is the result of a primary reason, and through following the suggestion of the book Appalachian Trials and making a list of whys I have discovered many, many secondary reasons, none any less important than the former.I believe at some point I will have the courage to collect my thoughts and become transparent enough to share the primary reason, but it is not today. Today, I share 10 other important reasons that this journey will take place. I will list them here, numbered not as a matter of importance, but as a matter of knowing I am listing 10:1. To give myself a new physical challenge2. To have an amazing story3. To meet and connect with new people4. To be happier with less5. To reconnect with my oldest, dearest friend6. To grow in my relationship with Christ7. To experience something a relatively small number of people get to experience8. To do something different from ""normal""9. To break from the endless cycle of excessive technology10. To complete an activity that has a 70% failure rateTo complete something such as this, something so mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and physically taxing, a person must know exactly why, and that why can only come from them. They may find an inspiring story, read a highly motivating book, and/or talk to an extremely excited person who's done it before, but they and they alone have to decide the reason(s) they are doing it.A person can't hike 2,189 miles without having that reason. It will be what keeps them going when they are soaked through to the skin in 30 degree weather, when they are out of food and 2 days away from their next resupply, when they get lost and spend half a day backtracking to get on the trail again. Because at that point ""being bad-ass"" or ""saying I wanted to"" isn't good enough. At that point, only the reason(s) you have contemplated before the trip ever began will be enough.I have my reasons and now I have shared some of them. I hope some of you reading this eventually decide to take all the whys to your dreams and goals and turn them into your own life-changing adventures.",,10 Reasons I'm Thru-Hiking the A.T.,"Jul 27, Mon",0
Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507879,"I have secured a second sponsor for my trip; one that may prove to be invaluable in the long run. Ticks are a rather large concern both here in Kentucky where I hike and along the Appalachian Trail. The diseases they carry have forced a number of people off the trail and have even left some with lifetime ailments, which is why I'm pleased to announce that Rid-A-Tick will be my next piece of gear.First aid and similar gear can often be overlooked or deemed unnecessary by hikers who are in good shape and/or think they can reach the next town when needed without a problem. This is true in many cases, but one thing I've learned about wilderness excursions and survival is to always have some sort of first aid kit with basic essentials if the shit hits the fan. In my case this will include Rid-A-Tick.",,Pack a First Aid Kit,"Jul 30, Thu",0
Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508253,"I try to be as independent as possible. As an adult I should be responsible and self-sufficient without needing anyone's help. However, I am guilty of needing my parents' help on multiple occasions over the years, which is a fact I hate. Independence is a never-ending battle it seems; something I work hard for though don't always succeed at.As a graduate student working full time taking 5-6 months away from daily life doesn't seem practical, and I guess in many ways it isn't. However, one valuable lesson I've learned in my 20's is that school and daily responsibilities will always be there. The chance to pursue your dreams may not be.I didn't make the decision to thru-hike lightly. I weighed the pros and cons and in the end deemed it important enough to pursue. This doesn't, however, make it easy to accomplish. I've read many blogs and journals and talked at great length with Kimmy about the details of this trip. My conclusion: it's going to be hard! It's going to have physical challenges and mental challenges and there will probably be times when I ask myself why I've decided to do. But in the end it's going to be worth it.Now, it may seem like the previous trains of thought didn't really go together, but they do. This trip will have many challenging aspects and a number of them will need to be overcome with help. As much as I wish I could be independent and hike 2,189 miles without needing anybody it's just not possible.One reason, which in a long round-a-bout way is the primary purpose of this post, is that it's not financially feasible right now, which is where sponsors come in. I have dedicated a page on this blog to sponsors for that very reason. The companies and organizations who are taking the time to invest in me deserve to be recognized; that's why they sponsored me! They believe in what I'm doing and invest their products in making this possible for me and in return I turn into a walking advertisement.I've heard it said that searching for sponsors is a long process that yields little success. I've heard it said that searching for sponsors is a waste of time unless you are famous or doing something to the ultimate extreme of crazy. And what I've learned in the last month is that it is a long process. It is difficult to sell what you want to do to complete strangers.But you know what? When you do get through to somebody it's worth it.I had two companies email me back today saying I can add them to my sponsor page, and when I read those emails I wasn't thinking about the 40 others I sent that I haven't gotten responses from yet. I didn't think about how long it took to write the emails. All I thought was ""wow, I sold myself and my dream to this company.""So, if you are chasing a dream or a goal and somebody says, ""it's not worth the time,"" or ""it's not worth the effort,"" or ""if you can't do it alone you shouldn't do it at all"" : ignore them! It really is as simple as that. Ignore them and do what you want to do and go after that dream however you can! Don't let anybody else's doubt make you doubt yourself. Nobody should have that power over you.",,Throwing Independence Out the Window,"Aug 02, Sun",0
Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508584,"It hit me today that my normal routine is going to change a lot in two weeks. Right now I enjoy getting up every day at my leisure, checking my email in my PJs, picking new sponsors to contact, staring at my kitchen until I decide what I want to make for breakfast and lunch, and browsing T.V. shows until work. In two weeks I start my second year of grad school. I will have to set a specific time to get up in the morning, homework for 2 classes, finishing a paper from this summer I should already have done, amped up training time for my upcoming Obstacle Course Racing World Championships, and 6-8 hr work days. To top that all off I have been asked to talk to a woman about working with her special needs son 3 hrs a day, 5 days a week during school hrs before my normal work schedule starts. Yikes! It sounds even busier when I write it out!On a positive note, in the last 48 hrs I bought a plastic tote to start collecting my thru-hike stuff in, I located the really nice (and expensive) rain pants and rain jacket I thought I had gotten rid of, one of my new sponsors said she shipped out my gear, and I found out my OCR trainer is going to be in Chicago for my next race Aug. 15th!

Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508905,"As an undergraduate non-profit major I learned the importance of networking. People need to know you are interested in them, their company, and/or their mission before they are willing to invest time, effort, money, or anything else into you. And if they would like to help, but don't have the answers or are not the correct fit for whatever it is you want to do, they are much more likely to recommend you to someone else or at least point you in the right direction.As I was working on emails and my social media accounts today I realized that networking has everything to do with sponsors too. Essentially its the same idea as fundraising for a nonprofit. You are selling yourself and your mission to another person or company. This hit even closer to home when I realized one of the secured sponsors for my thru-hike also offers products I can use for my OCR training and races. Not only could he tell me more about specific products, but he was willing to give me a discount on those items.As an introvert I struggled for many years to ""like"" people. Now, I certainly still have my moments of avoiding the world, but as I've worked on my character development and leadership development over the last few years I've come to accept and enjoy people a whole lot more. I still have many, many flaws to overcome and improve in myself to help me have healthier, more enjoyable relationships with those I come into contact with, but I am amazed at the changes God has helped me make already.This preparation for the A.T. hike has reminded me of the importance of my growth and development as a person and nonprofit professional.

Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510023,"I finally told my mom about my thru-hike, and even though I expected a million questions and a tone filled with reproach I was both surprised and excited when she asked me how far the trail is, where it starts, and where it ends and she repeated each answer back to me as she wrote it down. Then she said, ""Well, you're going to need a good camera and lots of sim cards. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and you'll want to take a lot of pictures."" She said it so matter of fact I wanted to give her a huge hug through the phone. My mom is the most important person in my life and her support means everything to me. I have set my mind on making this journey and I will not be deterred by lack of support from anyone or from the most difficult of obstacles that may arise, but I definitely sleep easier and worry less about all of it knowing my closest friends and my mom are rooting for me.

Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510444,"Different people choose different ways to prepare for the A.T. physically. Some like to just start walking more often around their neighborhood. Others like to hike short trails several times beforehand. I like to step outside the norm and do obstacle course racing. I spent this last weekend just outside of Chicago running a Spartan Super on Saturday and a Spartan Sprint on Sunday. For those of you not familiar with Spartan races, they are varying distances with obstacles including crawling under barbed wire, jumping 8' walls, throwing spears, carrying buckets of gravel, and scaling 15-20' ft ropes over muddy pits. You also must complete 30 burpees after every obstacle you can't complete. A burpee is standing straight up, jumping down into a plank, doing a pushup in which your chest touches the ground, and jumping back up with your feet totally leaving the ground and your arms raised above your shoulders. Call me crazy, but I love Spartan races! This weekend my two races meant 12+ miles, 45+ obstacles- mud and hills not withstanding, and 270 burpees. Now I'm back home sore and tired, but happy and gearing up for a new semester of school. I feel pretty confident that if I can handle a weekend like this last one I can handle backpacking a decent number of miles until my body acclimates to constant trail life.

Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512416,"Kimmy had a year of planning and several food sponsors under her belt when I decided to join her adventure. She told me she was focusing solely on healthy, organic companies due to the large volume of thru-hikers with reported nutritional deficiencies after leaving the trail. I immediately agreed with her decision.I have personally experienced the effects of overloading my system with greasy, fatty, sugary foods for days on end. I have felt bloated, sluggish, and unmotivated from those binges. On the flip side, I have also experienced a high-protein diet with fresh fruits and vegetables and complex carbs multiple days and weeks on end, which resulted in an overall increase of energy and a positive mood. As an athlete I strive for the latter and perform best under those circumstances. Carrying a pack up and down mountains for 5 continuous months means a huge increase in appetite, which in turn means a huge increase in necessary caloric intake. Most hikers battle this with high fat, high calorie foods that have little to no nutritional value; foods like ramen noodles and snickers. This diet is the cheapest, easiest way to survive the trail and I hold no judgment concerning anybody who adheres to it. However, in addition to being a health-conscious athlete I also suffer from PTSD and Bipolar II, which makes everything I consume a sensitive issue; I know that for me the aforementioned diet causes blood sugar spikes and drops and will cause serious problems both physically and mentally. Obviously, the most logical thing for me to do is take the extra time and money and plan a diet that minimizes the risk of negative mood swings due to nutritional deficiencies. Kimmy's selection of companies that provide natural, organic foods and snacks does just that.       Last week I received my first food sponsorship package from Perfect Bar. They are not adding to their roster of sponsored athletes, but they still graciously sent me 3 boxes of their bars. I also happened to win an Instagram giveaway from Health Warrior and their package is slated to arrive by the beginning of next week. Whatever they send will be squirreled away with my Perfect Bars and I look forward to adding more healthy bars and snacks in the coming months. Eating healthy on the trail for such an extended period of time may be difficult, but it is not impossible and it is well worth the investment of extra time and money.",,Avoiding Nutritional Deficiencies,"Sep 03, Thu",0
Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513529,"This weekend I accomplished two things: one night camping with 2 good friends, Daniel and Jacquelyn, and one night camping with just my dogs. While I went on dozens and dozens of camping trips growing up and in my early twenties, it had been 2 years since my last camping adventure and I had never been solo camping. 
I have never once questioned my physical ability to make the A.T. trip, but I was a bit rusty when it came to survival and multi-day camping, so this weekend was good prep time. It gave me the opportunity to refresh my knowledge of basic camping skills: starting a fire, cooking over an open fire, using a camp stove, and picking quick, easy meals for the trail.  Furthermore, camping solo had always been a daunting concept for me, but ended up being a huge success. Before I did it I was kind of afraid I would somehow fail; maybe I wouldn't be able to make a fire or I'd starve or I'd be afraid of the woods at night by myself and go home before the end of the night. As lame as they sound now, those were the thoughts running through my head when I thought about solo camping.
Thankfully my night was nowhere near terrifying or unpleasant and I reaffirmed my ability to be self-sufficient. I thoroughly enjoyed the quiet alone time with my dogs and I can't wait to do it again.Daniel, Jacquelyn, and I went to a group camping spot at Land Between the Lakes Saturday night. It was secluded and we enjoyed some great conversations and tasty meals. Daniel had to leave early Sunday morning, but Jacquelyn and I ended up hiking at Hematite Lake and having lunch before she headed back to Bowling Green. When she left I headed farther into LBL for some backcountry camping. I found the perfect spot right on the lake in the middle of nowhere and pitched camp. I made a roaring fire, hung my hammock, and enjoyed the peace of nature's sights and sounds. Over the course of the evening I watched dozens of fish jumping out of the water and eating bugs on the surface, saw the sky painted pink and purple with the sunset, and heard geese and coyotes. I contemplated my decision to hike 2,000+ miles and smiled. I stared at the stars and rocked gently in my hammock trying to imagine what it will be like to replay my current evening every day for 5 months and smiled again. In nature God speaks to me and touches my soul in ways He doesn't anywhere else.That night, also for the first time, I slept in a hammock the whole night through. My custom hammock hasn't come in yet so I borrowed Daniel's. It was comfortable and I felt less achy the next morning. Panda slept under the hammock the entire night, which was great. I was a little nervous about her being restless if she couldn't see me, but she took to it like a champ. I definitely felt the draft underneath the hammock, but that problem will be eliminated when my underquilt arrives. I am looking forward to longer solo trips (with hiking) this fall as I begin arranging gear in my pack and figuring out the weight of it all. I am both lucky and blessed to have LBL practically in my backyard to do those trips. I'm hoping by the time Kimmy and I do a trial run in January I will be much more prepared and ready to roll out in March.",,First Solo Camping Trip,"Sep 15, Tue",0
Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516123,"Oh, what a month it has been! I worked feverishly for several days to finish a long-overdue graduate paper, spent hours and hours in the library as I researched and wrote a paper for a ""group"" project that my group decided not to help me with, spent 3 days in Pulaski, TN for the Warrior Dash World Championship, and spent 4 days in Ohio for the OCR World Championships. Everyone in my household is tired of me being gone from the house so often, myself included.Of course by everyone I mean all my fur babies. My kitty Minute ran into the house Monday night when I got home from Ohio and after eating he jumped up on my bed and refused to get off until I rolled out of bed Tuesday morning. Sleeping on my bed is not a particularly unusual thing. However, he does not usually sleep on top of or next to me the entire night. Likewise, my dogs have been as needy as ever; last night Kylee (my 70 lb boxer/lab mix) decided that sleeping on my legs was the only way to keep me from floating away and Arlo, aka Old Man (my senior beagle mix with a lot of health problems), has only settled down at night this week if he is sleeping against my side.With so much going on I know more than a few things have gotten laid to the side; Unfortunately, one of those things is my planning for the A.T. Sponsorship emails, planning trip details, and making lists have all come to a halt this month. I may or may not be racing this weekend. If I do it will be my last race of the season. If I don't then I am done until Feb 2016. Either way, the next week and a half will be dedicated to catching up on school and housework with my normal training schedule.

Last I remembered it needed to be restocked, which is why I hadn't bothered unpacking it when I started putting my thru-hike supplies all together in a plastic tote. Tonight, I was pleasantly surprised to find several small items that will be definitely be going with me, including the headlamp I had about given up on finding. Knowing that the pack was low on supplies I had actually forgotten a lot of what was in there to begin with. Now I have an emergency blanket, an emergency poncho, a brand new magnesium fire starter, a light stick, my kerhsaw knife, some hand warmers, and other various odds and ends that may or may not go with me.

Even though I work tomorrow it is Sabbath and it reminds me that everything is going to be fine as long as I leave things in God's hands.I had an interview this afternoon for after my respite hours at my current position is over (approx 5 weeks). I had been praying for a callback on this job and was so relieved when I got it yesterday. Even with my current sponsors I am short of being financially stable during this trip. I'm not concerned about the actual trip so much as I'm worried about paying for my continued expenses while I'm gone. I'm making various arrangements for my animals I'm not taking and I have my regular monthly bills. I work daily on not being anxious about it. It has been made obvious that God sends us on this trip with His blessing, which means I have no reason to be anxious, but my human nature tries to fight logic sometimes. So I continue one step at a time.    Yesterday I made several small steps towards being more prepared for our journey. First, I received my sponsorship package from Adventure Medical Kits. They were gracious enough to include several products that come outside of their fully packaged kits, such as mosquito protection wipes, QuikClot Advanced Clotting Gauze, an emergency bivy, and an AfterBite Itch Eraser stick. While I obviously hope that many of these products don't require use, I am thankful to have them should the need arise. There is nothing scarier than being alone in the woods and having a freak accident. With the Adventure Medical Kit's gear I feel fully confident in our ability to take on whatever health challenges that may come up. And an added bonus: their medical kit is ultralight and watertight!!!Second, I received an email from GripSling welcoming me to their team. I am especially excited about partnering with them because their equipment is fairly light and easy to pack away. I will be shaving weight in some areas to make room for the GripSling training straps and my hand gripper. 5 months on the trail presents me with a chunk of time for focusing on myself and my well-being. It is my time to be selfish if you will. This includes bringing a new level of intensity to my training, which really is important to me.As I said before, I am confident with it all in God's hands.

Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517519,"Where are you going? That is the million-dollar question at any given time in your life: high school, your undergraduate program, your graduate program, starting your career. Everyone wants to know what you're doing with your life. And it's not just you, so don't feel like you're being put on the spot. Everyone wants to know what everyone else is doing with their life. Personally, I think that's usually less because they're actually interested and more because they want to compare it to their plans and be sure they don't feel ""outdone."" However, that is neither here nor there. People ask you what you're going to do and where you're going and expect a response.Do you have an answer? Many of you probably do and many of you probably don't, and that's OK. Something I've learned to be OK with is not ""having it all together"" all the time and certainly not expecting other people to either. I know there are many people in this world that want to ignore the ""messy"" or ""dark"" side of humanity and our every day lives, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist, and I've learned that many times in order to encourage other people to open up to you and be vulnerable you first have to be vulnerable to them. Show them that it's OK to not be perfect and that that's not what you expect from them. Now, it may seem like I sidetracked a little there from where are you going to being vulnerable to people, but I promise I will tie them together.In just under four months I will begin backpacking the 2,189 miles of the Appalachian Trail. That's where I'm going right now. And guess what? That isn't an accident. I know, that sentence is shocking to some of you, but I really do feel like I have to state it: me backpacking the Appalachian Trail is not an accident, it is a choice.Choice, it is the common thread in all of the things I've talked about so far. You choose how you will react to the questions people ask you about your life. You choose whether to be vulnerable and let people in or shut them out. You choose where you want to go in life, now and 10 or 20 or 30 years from now. Your life, your interactions with people, where you are going, none of those things are accidents! Whether you realize it or not, those are all choices that you make every day. And there's another choice, even more important than deciding where you want to go: how are you going to get to where you want to go? THAT should be the million dollar question. Anybody can dream. Anybody can talk about what kind of life they want and the things they want to do. But what about actually making it happen?Everything in your life is a choice. Yes, your choices one day will effect the choices you can make the next day and so on and so forth and you may eventually get to a point where you feel like you have no more choices in what's going on, but that's a lie. Every day you wake up and you choose what you are going to do that day. There are basic responsibilities that you need to get done like eating and taking your dog out, but then what? Then there are dozens of other things screaming for your attention. How do you choose? Do you just pick the most convenient ones to do? Or the ones that bug you the most? Which ones are going to help you get to where you want to go? Which ones seem important in the moment, but don't help you work towards your end goal?Every day we hear powerful and influential people say, ""dream big!"" and ""don't stop dreaming!"" I'm not saying they don't mean it because they really do. They want you to follow your dreams like they did and be successful, but they're leaving out the key ingredient: HOW? How are you going to achieve your goals and your dreams? What are you doing to reach them? You can't just sit on the couch at home or in an office chair at work and expect it all to just HAPPEN. The A.T. did not HAPPEN to me. I chose it. And every choice I make now determines whether I will achieve it and how successful I will be at it.Every day that is the choice life presents to you: fulfill your every-day, mundane responsibilities and dream about what you want to do and who you want to become, OR live deliberately and do something, however small, that helps you step towards achieving your dreams.",,The Million Dollar Question,"Nov 18, Wed",0

I love the stress relief I find at the gym, the rush of competing, and the physical results from an active lifestyle. I also love being able to eat just about anything I want because I really like food. I like fast food, home-cooked food, fatty food, healthy food, pretty much all food. I don't indulge in the unhealthy variety nearly as much as I used to because I feel the mental and physical difference from doing so often, but it definitely still does happen from time to time! I'm glad that me working out 4-6 days a week means my metabolism is extremely high. It means not gaining weight after a couple cheats meals. It also means my body won't have to work as hard to adjust to the increase in food on the trip, which makes it somewhat easier; However, by the same token, it will be much more challenging to keep the necessary caloric intake healthy.

My adventure will be documented while hopefully: 1. motivating more people to go out and chase their dreams and goals 2. stretching my writing material comfort zone and 3. providing me with a step into the professional writing world.Sunday was followed yesterday with the news that I now have the support of two wonderful companies, The New Primal and Ruby Bay Salmon Jerky. Both companies offer great nutritious snacks that I believe will serve me well on the trail and off, and I encourage all of my readers to go check them out.Tomorrow is Thanksgiving and I have an abundance of things to be thankful for, including God giving me the physical ability to make this trip and providing the way to do it.Now, I'm sharing my Appalachian Trials blog with you and I hope you read it, enjoy it, share it, follow it, and have a wonderful Thanksgiving!

Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517803,"In my preliminary research on taking a dog for a thru-hike I found more negativity than I first envisioned. There were a few comments about it being positive, but blog posts seemed to stay at ""things to remember when taking a dog"" and ""why taking a dog isn't a good idea."" I knew when I decided to take Panda that it was: 1. a non-negotiable decision and 2. possible without a doubt.I 100% agree that previous thru-hikers have a lot of experience and knowledge in this area, but I also recognize the fact that many of them commenting or posting didn't take dogs with them, but were merely discussing dogs they had run into once or twice. I try to be as much of a courteous and responsible dog owner as I can possibly be and I will definitely take those negative comments seriously and keep in mind how much of an impact Panda could have on other thru-hikers' experiences.All that being said, the first big hurdle I have to take Panda with me is to get her the appropriate gear. Her list is obviously not as extensive as mine, but just as critical. I am very excited to announce my newest partnership with Backcountry K-9. They have a very large selection of camping and outdoor gear for dogs as well as some of the best online customer service I've ever dealt with. I will share more about our partnership in the coming weeks.

When I get home we will head to Pinhoti National Recreation Trail for 48 hrs. I have a large percentage of my gear already and am sure several other pieces will be Christmas and birthday gifts.

In return they have asked me to write a guest blog for them at the end of the trip in addition to their social media coverage before and during! I can not even begin to express in words how important this is to me! I have been praying and praying for God to open doors and influence the right companies to help me make this trip and He has provided in tremendous ways! 5 months ago God answered a very specific prayer request to show me if this trip, something I desperately wanted, was something I really needed. He made His answer very clear and has continued to guide me in my preparations. I know a lot of people don't believe in God, but my faith is strong and I know He wants a close, personal relationship with us.

Today should have been it, but between plain old, good-fashioned procrastination and fighting several illnesses/injuries the last few weeks I have not finished my last two projects required to pass one of my classes. In case you were wondering, completing a semester of graduate school while working, training for obstacle course races, and planning a 6-month hiatus in the woods is extremely difficult, not to mention taxing. However, you can't accomplish goals and reach your dreams if you aren't willing to make some sacrifices along the way. Panda and I are now 3 months and 2 days away from our Appalachian Trail departure. That is both extremely exciting and nerve-wracking. I'm doing my best to focus on the gear I already have versus the gear I don't. I will purchase my pack in January and I will be using Kimmy's old pack or her husband's for our shakedown. This weekend I have to take Panda's measurements and send them to Backcountry K-9 for her gear. They will do their best to get it to me before Christmas so Panda can have a shakedown experience too and we can get some awesome pre-trail training pictures. Another exciting piece of news is my new partnership with CANIDAE. They are a grain-free, natural pet food company and will be supporting Panda throughout our trip. They will also feature Panda on their blog, which I find very exciting.CANIDAE is a good company. This year they sponsored a number of great events on the west coast, including the Golden Gate Kennel Club 113th and 114th Annual Blue Ribbon Dog shows held at the famous Cow Palace in Daly City (San Francisco), CA and America’s Family Pet Expo held in Costa Mesa, CA.

Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518399,"When you decide to hike or backpack there’s a good chance you don’t know who you’re going to see along the way, and the further away from your home or your comfort zone you get the greater your chance is of seeing people you don’t know. Now, take that information and apply it to a 2,189 miles trek across 14 states. An extrovert who can float from person to person and group to group making friends at the drop of a hat doesn’t see it as a problem. In fact, it probably seems like a wonderful idea. However, for those of us who are not extroverted social butterflies it seems a bit intimidating. I am not nearly as shy or awkward meeting new people as I was growing up, but I definitely still fall into the introvert category, and my best friend is so socially anxious she makes me look like an extrovert. In fact, said best friend and my dog Panda will begin thru-hiking those said 2,189 miles of the Appalachian Trail with me and Panda is most easily, and somewhat obviously, the most sociable being in our trio!When I meet someone for the first time I like to smile and nod, maybe shake hands, and then observe the other party for an extended period of time. How extended? Well, that is usually determined by what you’re wearing (how creepy do you look?) and how loud you’re being (how obnoxious are you?). I tend to subconsciously put both factors on a continuous scale and then grade them based on their intersecting point.On my scale, F is good and A is bad because F = you failed at being creepy and A = you were great at being obnoxious. Admittedly, I confused myself the first time I tried to write that sentence, but we’re good now.Example #1:You’re a young woman in her early twenties wearing brown convertible hiking pants, a purple shirt, and hiking boots. You smile and laugh a lot and seem to be at ease with everyone. You don’t look creepy or give off creepy vibes so on the creepy scale you’re an F. You’re also a college student traveling alone who appears to be interested in knowing a lot about all of your new, however brief, traveling companions and you ask a steady stream of questions the moment someone new is in sight. On the obnoxious scale you’re a B.Final verdict:I will answer your questions if they are directed specifically towards me, but I will not volunteer information and I will or will not avoid a shelter with you based on the kind of day I’m having and what my tolerance level is at that moment.Example #2:You are a young man in your late twenties-early thirties wearing brown hiking pants, a green shirt, and hiking boots. You smile often, but don’t initiate first contact. You don’t give off creepy vibes so on the creepy scale you’re an F. You quit your job as an office accountant to hike the trail and figure out what you really want to do with your life. You speak calmly and navigate through conversations based on how chatty your companion seems to be at the time. On the obnoxious scale you’re an F.Final Verdict:Are you single?Previous thru-hikers frequently discuss the changes the trail made to them: mentally, physically, and emotionally. Some changes were made and expected, others just seemed to creep up on them and happen subtly. For current hikers there’s probably a level of uncertainty about both. As I look towards my own thru-hike just a few months away I find myself making a list of changes I would like to see in myself, and I start wondering about unforeseeable things.Five or six months in the woods gives you plenty of time to turn yourself inside out; really get to know who you are, what you believe, why you believe what you do, how to understand yourself better, how to accept others in uncomfortable situations, and, probably most important, how to accept yourself in uncomfortable situations.Everyone who starts the trail has to deal with all of those whats, whys, and hows to a certain extent. Each person is at a different point in their life, which ultimately dictates what changes happen to them and within them. There are a lot of things I know about myself and a lot of things I still need to learn, and I have just under 3 months to get comfortable with being uncomfortable.",,Being Uncomfortable ,"Dec 14, Mon",0

Thankfully, I'm starting to feel like I'm almost ready to go.Kimmy and I were able to take our shakedown hike over Christmas weekend at Cheaha State Park, the highest point in Alabama, and it was very helpful. There were a lot of less-than-stellar moments, but we needed those as well as the great ones.Here's a quick run-down of both:1. Rain meant practice under less-than-ideal conditions. We were able to practice (rather unsuccessfully) trying to make a fire with everything soaked.2. Nights were chilly enough to warrant sleeping in cold-weather base layers, but day-time hiking was fairly warm and required shedding of a layer. That reaffirmed the need to choose layering carefully to avoid sweating and getting base layers wet unnecessarily.3. Backcountry K-9 gear is perfect for our trip.4. An underquilt is a non-negotiable piece of gear for hammock camping.5. A rain fly for hamoock camping is a must even in foggy and after-rain days and nights to avoid getting soaked.6. The pack I borrowed from Kimmy puts all of the weight on your shoulders, not hips so I cannot use it for the thru-hike. Also, its a 45L and 45L pack is NOT big enough for my stuff and Panda's. I will be going with a 65L or 70L.7. I learned how to hobo fish with just fishing line, a hook, and a stick from the woods, and cooking entire fish over an open fire is awesome. I'm taking fishing line and hooks to, hopefully, do the same thing on our thru-hike.8. There's nothing quite like clear, cold, rushing water down the side of a mountain.I learned many things over the weekend, but none more important than the affirmation that I need this trip more than anything else in my life right now.

I'm so glad it's over.After bouncing around shifts for training every week in Dec. and last month I'm finally a full-time third shift employee. Now, after it took them 5 weeks to get me trained I get to wait 2 weeks and then give them my 3-week notice. And I know that sounds terrible, but there are two important things to remember: 1) I was technically working for the company from May to November when I worked with Jonathan (the sweetest little 7-yr-old boy with autism you'll ever meet)I just had to change positions within the company when his respite hrs. ran out. 2) If I had told them I was leaving in March they would not have hired me for this new position and I would have been out of a job, eliminating the way for me to come up with enough money for my bills or my trip.I also started this new semester of grad school two weeks ago. Well, I actually had some financial aid difficulty and had to register late, but the semester started 2 weeks ago and now I've got a giant plate of projects and papers in front of me for the next 14 weeks or so. Kimmy and I leave just before my spring break starts, right in the middle of the semester, and it will be a huge challenge to complete, but I can and I will because I must. I have to finish grad school and I have to go on this trip and with God's grace and hands I will do it!My new Kamik boots arrived last week. The original pair I got several weeks ago were a size too small and I was waiting anxiously for the new ones. I wore them all evening and night Friday after they arrived on my stoop Friday afternoon. They are some of the most comfortable cold weather boots I have ever had; warm, waterproof, and lined. The insides are soft and they are rated for cold up to -40 deg. Fahrenheit. I'm kind of wishing for more snow here so I can go hike in them at LBL.I am still anxiously awaiting my hammock from one of my sponsors. He has gotten behind with orders and I pray he gets it done before time for us to leave. If he doesn't come through I will still use a hammock sleep system, it just means I'll have to find another company I like. I am hammock hunting now to be prepared for either way it goes.I have further narrowed down my needed gear and supplies this last weekend. A friend assisted me in purchasing everything for my drop boxes and distributing it into the boxes, except food. We also traveled to the nearest Gander Mountain where I purchased a water filter and spork. Both small, but necessary. It's nice to keep checking things off my list.The next two weekends will involve a short camping trip to use my new gear and a trip to REI in Nashville. I have two wonderful friends who are going to gift me a pack and food for my boxes. I am truly blessed with so much support.

Now I'm laughing....and searching for underwear. True, I have forgotten the need to get underwear specifically for this trip on several occasions, but the main reason it's still on my to-get list is simply that unless you're going completely without it for the whole trip it is an important piece of clothing and should not be chosen without at least some consideration. Like any other piece of clothing it should be comfy, moisture-wicking, and preferably anti-microbial, not exactly something you can find at your local Walmart (at least not middle-of-nowhere Kentucky Walmarts).Despite living so close to Land Between the Lakes, which is a huge recreational area, there is not a huge variety of outdoor stores where I live. The closest REI is in Nashville about 2 hrs. away and Gander mountain and Dick's Sporting Goods are both in Paducah, an hr.'s drive.

I'm currently working out plans to catch a ride forward into PA in the morning to meet a friend I haven't seen since almost high school.

Stitches and I are sitting here after devouring a bundle box of food and I'm feeling pretty good. I got my dropbox and Chris's package at the Doyle Hotel the day before yesterday. Now I have a full resupply, a knee brace, and pink KT tape. And my snack game is on point, lol. I've got more One Bars, chewy chocolate and nut bars, jerky sticks, fruit snacks, and all sorts of stuff. I'm definitely feeling much better by eating a snack every 1.5-2 hrs. Lots more energy and no hunger pains. 
That's one peice of advice that can't be stressed enough for thru-hikers: listen to your body if it's telling you it's hungry! You'll feel less drained and sore and better overall if you eat what your body needs, even if you don't really want to stop or eat that often. You can put snacks in your pack hip pockets or in your pants pockets to make them more accessible. I eat quite a few that way while I keep hiking. Anyway, I'm enjoying this Dr. Pepper and pretty soon we'll hitch back out. It's a short 20ish mile day because we have to hitch in to Pine Grove tomorrow for Stitches to pick up a package.Happy and safe hiking everyone!","

Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540870,"Stitches and I made it back to the trail and on to the William Penn Shelter yesterday. It rained on us the last 3 or so hrs of hiking and all night. I didn't feel like getting my gear wet so I slept in the shelter and really didn't sleep at all. Today has been mostly cloudy with a breeze so I'm hoping for nice weather tonight. Stitches, Big Spoon, and I shuttled into Pine Grove for showers, laundry, and food, which we're almost done with. No idea when we're actually getting out of here, but it's nice to be clean again (even if only for a short time) and we've already decided to make up some miles night hiking.I weighed Panda across the street at the Pine Grove Veterinary office. She's a healthy 43.7 lbs, which makes me very happy.Happy trails and safe hiking everyone!","

Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541640,"Yesterday was a long, wet, foggy day, but still cranked out 21.1 miles. I'm thankful for the cooler weather from the cloud coverage and rain. The only thing I wasn't too pleased with was 12 hrs of wet feet. Ranger made it to the shelter shortly after I did and we camped close to each other at the tent site area. Today we hiked together, went into Wind Gap for lunch, and hiked a few more miles to Kirkridge Shelter. Our original plan was to head on into Delaware Water Gap tonight, but there's an open field with a gorgeous view and Ranger pointed out it will be a gorgeous place to watch the sunrise if another storm doesn't roll in. We wouldn't get to town until around 9pm and it's a donation-based church hostel so chances are good I would have to tent outside with Panda anyway. So I decided to set up camp here at 6:30p instead with a plan to go to bed early, catch the sunrise, make a quick resupply in town early, and crank out some really big miles. My plans don't always work out, but I'll worry about that tomorrow. We'll be out of P.A. tomorrow!!! #excitedHappy hiking everyone!","

Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542941,"Hiked to Denning Hill last night after looking in AWOL's guide and seeing a camera next to it, which is supposed to mean a great view. Got there about a half hr before sundown and was disappointed to find a fire ring and no view. I suppose it wasn't a popular spot and got overgrown. I woke up a couple of times, but overall slept so well that I turned my alarm off this morning and slept in. Didn't leave camp until 9a and it felt great.I've been leap-frogging a group of other thru-hikers all day. Most of them I haven't seen since back in the beginning, others I haven't seen in the last few weeks. They're all fun to hang out with. We're actually all hanging out at the concession stand at Canopus Lake right now. They haven't decided if they're going to take the free tenting option here or move on. I haven't done many miles today at all, but my right ankle and my right knee started becoming achy the last couple miles to here so I don't know how far I want to push from here. I'm 34 miles from Connectict and I'm determined to be out of New York by tomorrow night. I may just do a really big day tomorrow and call it early tonight.Stay safe and have fun hiking everyone!","

Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546819,"This morning I find myself in a recliner in The White Birches Hostel. A lot has happened in the last week. Most notably, Chris got his vacation time approved and is flying to hike the 100 Mile Wilderness and summit Katahdin with me, Panda got hurt so she's taking at least a few days off from hiking, and I still have to summit by Sept 1st, but I have approx 320 miles left so I'll be skipping a small section of Maine this weekend.This journey has been full of surprises and has taught me so much about myself and perseverance and the things about myself I really want and need to work on. It's restored my faith in humanity, strengthened my bond with Panda, strengthened and renewed my relationship and faith in Christ, and given me the resolve to chase other dreams that seem just as far fetched now as living in the woods out of a backpack for 6 months before this trip did. I'm both nervous and excited about this trip ending in a week. I don't know what I'll get updated between now and then, but I will eventually fix the problems I'm having getting pictures uploaded and share more pictures of my journey.","

Wild Child,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606026,"I've written this post in my head a hundred times over since my last steps on the Appalachian Trail two years ago. Each time I started it was terrifying and anxiety-inducing the farther along I got, so I continued to put off writing it down.
But I'm not running away from that anymore. I don't believe any of you really know why I ran away to begin with so my hope is to start there and eventually share what finishing the trail meant to me and what it has led me to two years later.
My last trail journal post found Panda and I in Maine with just a week to finish the trail before my dad flew up to drive us home and Panda was injured. Thankfully, that all worked out right. Panda made a full recovery, Chris did indeed fly up and hike part of the 100 Mile Wilderness with me, and we summited Katahdin together on September 1st, 2016. I was glad to be done, not because I really wanted to rejoin civilization, but because somewhere in the last couple hundred miles or so my hiking had morphed from a delightfully determined march of forward progress into an agonizingly painful physical and mental stagger towards the finish line. My feet and knees had taken a beating and needed more than one or two days rest to recuperate. My self-imposed deadline became an anchor, dragging me down into feelings of guilt, anxiety, remorse, and self-loathing for skipping a section of Maine to finish on time, and to make things worse, on the day I summited and in the weeks that followed I received several texts messages from another hiker that included the following: 
""Congratulations, even if you didn't hike the whole trail."" 
""Pikey and I summited today. Unlike you, we are real thru-hikers.""
Needless to say, I was devastated mentally and emotionally. I had hiked 2,000 miles through snow and blazing heat, slept on picnic tables and rock outcroppings, walked 30 miles in crocs during a storm spawning tornadoes, sprinted to the riverbank in Hot Springs to evacuate my pack and hammock before a wildfire could reach them, and slept on the side of the trail in the Whites with no pack and no jacket during a slack-pack gone wrong. I had fought and conquered a myriad of personal demons, met amazing people on and off the trail, and in the end I didn't even feel like I could call myself a thru-hiker. I felt like a fraud. So, I retreated within a part of myself and I ran away from thinking about it anymore than I had to. When people asked me if I hiked the whole thing I found myself saying, ""no, just 2,000 miles"" or ""only 2,000 miles."" If someone called me a thru-hiker I felt a pang of guilt and the need to deny it. Really, I was ashamed. I was a ""yellow blazer"" and unworthy of the thru-hiker title.
Admittedly, two years later I still struggle with it sometimes. But I've come to terms with the fact that my choices led me to yellow-blaze a section of the trail in order to finish at a specific time that could not be changed by the time I realized it should be changed. There were too many factors in play, too many loved ones and plane tickets involved to change last minute. And I think now I've finally come to terms with that. I can't change it. All I can do is look forward to the next time I hike the A.T. and how I can avoid making the same mistakes.
The hiker that sent me the ugly texts when I finished, Stitches, finally stopped texting me and I haven't heard from him in two years, which is wonderful. He was really upset when I finished because we had hiked together for several weeks before I left him in town (partying and drinking and doing drugs) and hiked on; Then a few weeks later he decided he wanted to catch up to me, but Chris and I were already becoming more seriously involved at that point and I wasn't interested in anyone else. When Stitches did catch up we hiked together for just a few days before one of his drunken rants gave me a meltdown and a night bawling my eyes out at a trail angel's house, so I purposefully avoided him at all costs after that. However, for a long time I shouldered the responsibility for that situation too, even after I got off the trail, and bore its guilt and shame. 
Now I don't. I don't take responsibility for other people's emotions or behaviors. And I don't regret a single thing on the Appalachian Trail. Every single experience I had was important in shaping my life over the last two years and I wouldn't change a thing. I am happy and healthy and looking forward to many more long trails in the future.

P.S. Chris and I now live in Norfolk, VA together and Panda would still rather live in the woods than at home.",,View Entry,"Dec 26, Wed",0
