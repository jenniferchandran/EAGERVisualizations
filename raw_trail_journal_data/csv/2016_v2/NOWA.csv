The hostel was awesome but there was a guy snoring all night long in our bunk room of 6 that made sleeping very difficult. Not sure what the protocol in a hostel is - are you allowed to poke somebody in their side and grunt roll over...seems to work at home...on me of course in case Kim is reading this entry.Thre weather today turned cooler, foggy at times, and a few drizzles. Was perfect for hiking but couldn't see much. Left the Chattahoochee National Forest and am now in the Nantahala National Forest - but the big milestone today was crossing over from Ga to North Carolina - one state down, thirteen to go. Georgia was a lot like doing interval training for 8-9 hours per day - heart rate up, then down, then up, then down. Looks like I can expect some more of the same in NC and TN but the peaks will get higher and some of the climbs and descents a little longer...which is actually better on the knees.Cool characters on the trail today included ""Dawn"" who is just coming off of 2.5 years of Peace Corps duty, Conductor who is an ex-Navy Sr Chief and has hiked the trail before, and Spoons and Whistler, two teenagers from NYC.Some of my rookie mistakes so far include: 1) leaving my carabiner connected to a bear cable at Deep Gap Shelter after removing my food bag from the cable, 2) not remembering to look up before setting up my tent, and 3) leaving my tent in the middle of the night to pee and not taking my headlamp with me (coming back, several tents looked just like mine!).

The mountains were still dusted from last night's snow and the soft crunch under my feet quite peaceful. Many more streams crossing the trails in these first few days of NC compared to GA and so far I've only slipped once .

I needed to go to Franklin to replace the carabiner lost earlier in the week and so joined the hitchhiking effort. Within minutes, Ernie pulled over and took us to town. Ernie is a retired trucker who relocated from Yuma, AZ two years ago to get away from the heat. He dropped Roo of at a motel and then offered to drive me back to the trailhead after he waited outside while I shopped. He just needed to go to the post-office, the Walmart, and the dump first but promised it wouldn't be long...and it wasn't...while he got his weekly supply of Mountain Dew at Walmart, I ordered and ate half of a Subway sandwich...we then dropped off a package and stopped at the dump and I was back on the trail less than two hours after I left it. I said thankyou and he said that he planned on picking up more hikers in the future!At the trail-head going up to Panther Gap from where Ernie dropped me off was a cooler of bud-light...this is called ""trial magic"" typically left by former hikers. From there hiked to Wayah Gap and was picked up by Steve aka ""wiggy"", a 2010 thruhiker and former special services serviceman from the UK.

Not to be confused with ""slacker"". Donna, the retired RN who ran Cabin In the Woods, gave me a ""daypack"" for my snacks, water, iPad, and some emergency supplies and she shuttled the rest of my pack , full of my five day food resupply, over to where I am currently staying - the Fontana Lodge. This saved my knees about 35 pounds and allowed me to cover the 14 miles in a little over 6 hours. I soaked my feet in a tub full of ice water and have had an ice pack on my knee for a few hours. It's raining outside and I feel great being here.There is big dammed lake (and a big damn lake!) nearby which has connections to WWII. The authorization to build the Fontana Dam was made by Congress on December 17th, 1941 as part of the wartime emergency program for providing power for the manufacture of equipment and munitions. The dam was completed in under 36 months for something like $70 million, providing crucial energy for aluminum production in the closing months of WWII. IT is 480 feet tall and half a mile across - at the time it was the fourth largest dam in the world and remains today the largest dam east of the Mississippi, the lake it has formed has 238 miles of shoreline covering 10000 acres. Today Fontana lake is used for recreational purposes. I hope to get a picture of it tomorrow. I only passed one person all day on the trail today, but apparently there are over 20 people at the shelter one mile away, which is called the Fontana Hilton, because of its size.","Stecoah Gap

Sleeping side by side with ten other people in a shelter that's about 15x10 - the upside is that it will be warm as temperatures may dip into the 30's tonight. The downside is that unless you snore first, it's tough getting a good night's rest.

Had a lot of good advice, mostly on mind-set and philosophy. Hope I cross paths with him again.Tomorrow:Will hike about 11 miles to Newfound Gap where the AT crosses US 441 and get a ride into Gatlinburg, TN (15 miles west) for a meal not out of a bag and a cheap motel bed.

Got up early from the shelter I slept in last night with the hope of getting to a Gatlinburg, TN hotel by 1:00 pm. It rained most of the way with gusty winds. The trail turned into little streams in some places and in others the mud was thick and slippery. Visibility at Clingman's Dove, the highest point on the AT at 6,655 feet was about 100 yards. Compounding all of this, I took a wrong turn at a trail junction costing me about an hour of wasted travel. I finally got to my destination (Newfound Gap)!about 2 hours later than hoped for, - cold, wet, and tired...and then the magic began - as soon as I stuck my thumb out for a ride into Gatlinburg, ""Johnny"" and his three sons pulled over. They had been doing a hike themselves and were empathetic to my situation. While they didn't plan on going all the way into town, they did so anyway, calling a few motels along the way they thought would be reasonable. Incredible!

It included an ascent up to Mt Rogers, the highest peak in VA at 5729 feet, a beautiful stroll through the Jefferson National Forest, walking alongside wild ponies in Grayson Highlands State Park, and shimmying through ""Fatman Squeeze"" which is a rock tunnel just before Grayson Highlands. I will post more pictures on Facebook as this application only allows one picture. By the way, I took a very sharp knife out of my pack before going into the ""Squeeze"" as it looked strangely similar to the scene from 127'hours! 
Here is some Wikipedia info o the Jefferson National Forest and the ponies.  Washington and Jefferson National Forests are U.S. National Forests that combine to form one of the largest areas of public land in the Eastern United States. They cover 1.8 million acres (7,300 km2) of land in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky. Approximately 1 million acres (4,000 km2) of the forest are remote and undeveloped and 139,461 acres (564 km2)[3] have been designated as wilderness areas, which eliminates future development.The balds (by Mt Rogers)' are inhabited by a herd of introduced ponies allowed to run wild within the confines of the park. The ponies are very accustomed to humans and rarely halt their grazing as hikers pass close by. Many locals touch and feed the ponies, though this practice is frowned upon and against park policy. Each year, park officials round up the herd and check for health problems in addition to reducing the herd size if necessary; the excess colts are sold at auction.","Whitetop Mntn

Since leaving Hurricane Mntn on Thursday morning (4/14), I've walked 77 miles and am now at a cozy motel in Bland, Va, just a few miles from the trail at mile marker 590.1The last time i was in something other than a tent or AT shelter was Tuesday morning, leaving Damascus in the rain. It has not rained since, and starting Thursday morning, no evening has dropped below freezing. The weather has been great for hiking, as has the terrain. Virginia has its changes in elevation, but seems to have more switchbacks on the ascents and descents which makes the hiking easier on the lungs and knees. There are also a number of flat runs, sometimes through beautiful farmland, which is really nice on the eyes after being in so much forest. I have had 3 days of being nearly pain free which makes everything all the more enjoyable. The trail magic is thinning a bit as is the volume of hikers. I'll check the facts. But I think something like 75 percent of people who start with the intention of reaching Maine never make it. I've met a number of people already who had started in prior years and got knocked out, only to be back trying it again. Injuries have ranged from severe bronchitis, to Lyme disease, copperhead snake bite, torn ACL, broken ankle, and lots of broken spirits. I am thankful to not have any serious injuries yet (I'd say ""knock on wood"", but in the National Forest, it would seem redundant!)Highlights of the last few days have been many, including:1) Having lunch with Miles, a 2012 Chem Engineering graduate from the U of New Hampshire which is what and where I graduated from in 1983 - several,of my professors were his!2) The VA shelters and trails are incredibly well maintained, as are the privy's...particularly compared to TN - my guess is the State puts a good deal of money into this3) Meeting ""Old Man"" and sharing some food with him as he shared a beer with me. He is a 60 yr old first generation Chinese immigrant who looks like he is 40. He lives in Scranton Pa where his wife is a University Professor, but spends the week in Manhattan, writing for a Chinese newspaper. His closer connection to me is that he lives,in Flushimg, NY during the week which is in the neighborhood of where I was born and lived until First grade.4) Being given the cell phone number of Jim Sparks by the MOUNT Rogers visitors center who said if I needed a ride to or from town, Jim was liable to do it. I did call Jim and he picked me up within 10 minutes and refused to take anything other than a ""thank you"". Jim is a retired electrician and enjoys healing hikers!5) Saying hello to Louis on the trail outside of Damascus on Tuesday. He is a retired insurance professional from Southern Indiana who enjoys taking day hikes and bikes down here. Today, some five days and 120 hiking miles away, I'm having no luck hitch-hiking from the trail to the motel, and who stops to pick me up, but Louis! He wasn't going in my direction, but thought I looked familiar and he drove me right to the front office of the BIG WALKER MOTEL.6) Enjoying some conversation with Sub-man and his wife Suds (it's not what you think!).   He is a retired Navy Chief and spent time on two submarines in the same class (George Washington class boomers) as mine - the Simon Boliver and the Sam Rayburn. 7) Saying goodby to Rock, who I hope to see further up the trail. He was a Navy Seabbee who was in a Chinook helicopter that got shot down, woke up 3 days later, and spent 9 months in traction. He is now a chef and doing well. ,8)' Getting some great maildrops from my three favorite sisters with another one on the way from my friends at Kaiser Permanente9) Facetimimg with my wife Kim who has been with Liam out of the country for a week.

It was nearly a full moon and the temperature was quite comfortable, so I thought nothing of it. I had the entire shelter to myself and got the best night's sleep I've had since being on the trail.   Then, I had lunch today at another shelter who shared with me some news about the shelter that I was not aware of.

By my guide, it is on the Eastern Continental Divide. Because I couldn't remember what that really meant, I looked it up:: The Eastern Continental Divide, in conjunction with other continental divides of North America, demarcates two watersheds of the Atlantic Ocean: the Gulf of Mexico watershed and the Atlantic Seaboard watershed. Prior to 1760, the divide represented the boundary between British and French colonial possessions in North America. The weather has turned pretty quickly from unseasonably cold, to warm and humid., A thunderstorm is predicted for tonight. Several of the streams where hikers typically can get water are dry as there has not been much rain to date.   That said, the warmer weather and perhaps lower elevations have seemingly brought more wildlife out. Have seen several deer each day for the past several days, the skies are full of Hawks, and I darn near stepped on a 4+ foot black snake yesterday. Coyotes can be heard howling at night and grouse rumble out of rhododendrons periodically spooking me out. No bear yet but plenty of posted warning signs.Met a hiker last night whose trail name was Big O. I was thrilled because I thought he might have been named after the legendary Oscar Robertson whose nickname was the Big O. The hiker was about the same size as Oscar, but Korean.   When asked he said he had never heard of Oscar Robertson. Turns out he was shopping for supplies early in the trip and an older man came up to him and said something like, ""You are about the biggest Oriental I have ever seen!""

It rained much of today which was greatly needed in the forest. It made for some slippery footing, but such is hiking. There was one section of trial around Cove Mountain that was the most dangerous of the trip so far. I would have taken pictures but it was raining pretty steadily at the time and my I-pad prefers being dry. There were sections where I just sat down and slid down a rock-face. There were other sections where I had no idea where to step next. There were some steel steps inserted into the rock face in several sections, but even they didn't always seem lime the safest path down. Funny enough, for the Southbound hikers there were several signs further up the trail notifying how steep,and challenging this section was...not for the Northbounders...either the sign people ran out of funds, or we are just a heartier breed.

The day started with a long stare-down with a big bovine (picture above). I blinked first and so made a big loop around he and his friends. After that, it was clear sailing! The weather was partly cloudy with a soft breeze, little humidity, and I'm guessing low 70's - great for hiking. Because of the proximity to VA Tech, there were numerous college students on the trail today. There were also at least three different Boy Scout contingents and lots of small groups of friends as well as solo hikers. When they recognize you are a thru-hiker (maybe by the smell?) they gladly step aside and wish you well.Posted a number of pictures on Facebook showing the diversity of the day. One that I did not get because I wasn't quick enough was two cardinals which are my favorite birds...mostly because they were my father's favorite.

Shortly later, after not really enjoying the one pole climb, I came across a hiking stick someone had left behind...then it hit me, I'm in a freekin' forest, there's an abundance of solutions to my broken ""stick""!

The AT conservancy was crediting Thru hikers with this portion of the trail as the fire was something no one could do anything about.

After Walking about 4 miles to the Front Royal Terrapin Station Hostel on Tuesday, I took a shower, did some laundry, rented a car (Enterprise was on my side), and then drove to Maine where I am picked up Kim Wednesday at the airport ( it was a surprise). We are now in Boston and meeting up with Grace, Liam, and Kyle to watch to Alex graduate from Northeastern University ( he also thinks I'm still on the trail).. I don't usually like surprises, but this is fun! Will be back in VA on Saturday with a plan to complete the previously missed section I talked about by end of day Sunday....then, will restart at Front Royal on Monday, moving North.

This will compete the section I bypassed earlier. While I have been off the trail for a few days, this apparently is the first day in a long while without any rain. The trail was very wet and slippery in the morning, but by the afternoon relatively dry. My legs were achy all day and my feet swollen...probably should have been stretching the last several days while not hiking and trying to keep feet elevated. The trail crossed Skyline Drive numerous times today and there were plenty of hikers who were just out for a short stroll. This section of the trail, more than any other to date, is welcoming to all. Saw few critters but for,the first time got within about 10 yards of a deer who just stared at me for the longest time - until I tried to get my IPad out of my pack for a picture...then she ran away.The picture above is from Black Run Gap. Apparently, this area was pretty active millions of years go with the earth's plates shifting and lava oozing out.

His command, the 43rd Battalion, 1st Virginia Cavalry, known as Mosby's Rangers or Mosby's Raiders, was a partisan ranger unit noted for its lightning quick raids and its ability to elude Union Army pursuers and disappear, blending in with local farmers and townsmen. The area of northern central Virginia in which Mosby operated with impunity was known during the war and ever since as Mosby's Confederacy. After the war, Mosby became a Republican and worked as an attorney and supported his former enemy's commander, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant. He also served as the American consul to Hong Kong and in the U.S. Department of Justice.Good to know I was operating in Mosby's Confederacy"" all day today!

""The Roller Coaster is the A.T.’s swan song in Virginia, offering the last memorable piece of trail before reaching the “psychological half-way point” at Harper’s Ferry, W.Va. Known for its constant elevation change, you’ll climb more than a dozen significant hills for a total of 5,000 feet of gain as you make your way toward West Virginia. The tread is rocky, and the climbing is short but steep without a switchback in sight thanks to an unusually narrow right of way for the trail.Well that description is pretty darn accurate but what's left out is that when it rains for days on end, parts of roller coaster are underwater and other parts are a muddy mess (see other pictures posted in this journal). I plodded along at about 2 mph with my most significant accomplishment being that I didn't fall!

One of the functions of the ATC, as the lead organization in managing and protecting the A.T., is to maintain the official 2,000-miler registry of all those who have completed the A.T. Another, less official function, is the documentation of hikers who reach the halfway point. These hikers, whether hiking Northbound, Southbound, or Section hiking (completing portions in multiple trips) almost universally stop by the ATC headquarters for a few minutes. Having a simple Polaroid under the ATC sign after hiking 1,000 miles is a milestone anticipated by many hikers. The pictures are signed and numbered in the order the hikers arrive.

I spent the whole time looking down where to plant my feet and made sure I had a good grip on my poles. One bright spot of having my eyes down much of the day was that I spotted several Lady Slippers. My new friends, the Old Friends of the 2065 club I wrote about earlier this week will be happy. One member of the club had marked the position of a Lady Slipper with what looked like lime so the rest of the members would take note...when they asked me if I saw the flower, I had to admit that I saw the lime but didn't glance any further. They showed me a photo and told me to be on the lookout...and stop being in such a hurry.

We want to share with the public this diverse, and frankly, awe-inspiring national treasure. Shy and pale, or flaunting in glorious color, they can be found under trees, in small openings, grassy meadows or prairies. Some are rare or becoming rare, but with quality management and the help of our partners we can reverse that trend. To that end we practice conservation and manage their habitats so that future generations will also be able to enjoy their many benefits.It is our hope that you too will be struck by their beauty and complexity as you meet here the elegant “ladies” of our National Forests and Grasslands and help us in our efforts to protect them.Lady’s slipper orchids are in the genus Cypripedium in the Orchidaceae familyThe genus name Cypripedium is derived from the Greek words ""Cypris"" an early reference in Greek myth to Aphrodite, and “pedilon” for sandal. This is because the fused petals that form the orchid’s pouch or modified lip (labellum) resemble a slipper or shoe. The staminode (sterile stamen) is often showy and seems to welcome the insect into the pouch where it makes its way to a back-door exit and in so doing transfers pollen to the stigma.There are about 50 species that are widespread throughout boreal, temperate, and tropical regions of the European, Asian, and North American continents. More than 30 species are distributed in the Northern Hemisphere. Twelve species occur in the US and eleven are represented on National Forest System.""Duncannon is one of about 12 towns that the AT passes right through. It was welcoming but looks like it has seen its better days. A number of storefronts were closed as was a one time major manufacturer of snow sleds. I stopped at the Doyle Hotel for a cheeseburger and fries at about 3:00 pm. It came with many recommendations of other hikers and they were spot on.

It turns out that this area was rich with Antrhacite Coal - see this from Wikipedia: ""Coal deposits are scattered around the globe, but the coal from a 500 square mile region of northeastern Pennsylvania is special. During the Paleozoic era, 300 million years ago, what is now rugged and mountainous terrain was a steamy plain filled with swamps. Tropical plants grew and died here, and as decaying matter, sank to the bottom of these swamps to form a dense organic substance known as peat. Over millions of years, shifts in the earth's plates and other landscape changes compressed prehistoric peat deposits into mineral layers known as coal. In northeastern Pennsylvania, however, the ordinary process of coal formation was accelerated by a violent upheaval known as the Appalachian Revolution. In this ""revolution,"" rising mountains literally folded over, splitting open and thrusting up rock and peat formations from deep inside the earth. The extra pressure from this process yielded coal that was more pure, harder, and of higher carbon content than other types of coal. This coal is anthracite and over 95 percent of the Western Hemisphere's supply comes from this special region in northeastern Pennsylvania."" Also learned a little bit about Port Clinton as I was coming into town. The Schuylkill River flows through it and apparently during the revolutionary war logs were floated down it to Philadelphia for shipbuilding and later coal was moved through the Schuylkill Canal. The town is cute, but much like those that relied on a big industry like coal, seems to be a bit economically depressed. The forest in this area is anything but ""old growth"" - am guessing between shipbuilding and coal mining, a lot of this had been clear cut in the past.

I filled up at a reliable piped spring 0.1 miles north of the George Outerbridge Shelter.

My relatively new ALTRA shoes are quickly getting torn up and I will need to switch to something more sturdy very shortly. After crossing the Lehigh River, the trail went up 900 feet in a mile. From some prep hiking I had done at home in the Claremont Canyon in Berkeley Ca, I knew that anything greater than about 600 - 700 feet elevation change in a mile is really significant. Parts of this trail involved digging your toes and fingers in rocks and just pulling yourself up to the next level. While it wasn't long, it was the steepest and most challenging mile on the trail to date. Some hikers were taking their pack off, pushing it up a few feet, and then pulling their bodies up. The trail next went through a deforested ridge for about 3 miles, deforested,due to,zinc smelting from 1898 to 1980. The area around it is known as the Palmerton Superfund site.While I wasn't planning on it, after getting a bit beat up on the trail and climbing the rocky steep trail from Lehigh gap, I decided to check into a B&B. It was a very wise move.Some info I pulled,from the web on the B&B and zinc smelting follow:In 1912, the New Jersey Zinc Company located a zinc smelting operation (what is now the West Plant) here, in order to take advantage of the anthracite coal being mined just north of Palmerton and the zinc mines in Franklin, New Jersey. The town was named after New Jersey Zinc's then-President, Stephen S. Palmer, though Palmer was reportedly not pleased with having his name on the town.A second location, the East Plant, was established on the other side of town in 1911. Zinc smelting was ended in 1980 due to a poor zinc market and environmental regulation. The West Plant was demolished in 2010. The East Plant continues to operate at reduced capacity, processing electric arc furnace dust into zinc calcine.

As the temperature and humidity rises, this is a great opportunity to continue moving north while getting a break from carrying the full pack and adjusting to the climate. It is also a real treat to visit with family while on the trail.Today was an exciting one on the trail for me. Crossing into New Jersey was one of the highlights as it is where I grew up and hold many found memories. The trail softened quite a bit from the last several days in PA, and the views opened up considerably. While the Delaware River was certainly the most well known body of water I walked by today, Sunfish Pond really stole the show. It is a 41 acre glacial pond and is one of the seven natural wonders of New Jersey. Due to its natural acidity, only a few species of fish can survive in the Pond including the pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow perch. I also caught a snake catching a nap on a rock in the pond, and worked hard not to wake him! 150 feet or so above the pond was the summit of Kittatinny Mountain offering great views of the Delaware River Valley and nearby Reservoir. On my way down the Kittatinny, I photographed a toad that was orange...had never seen anything like it before.

Two of my sisters from upstate New York (Berh and Lymn) surprised me by joining the party. A great way to end a great day.After being dropped off at the Sumrise Mountain trailhead by my cousin Eileen, slack packed 20.2 miles to where the AT crosses the Wallkill River. The trail crossed a number of both paved and gravel roads today, as well as traveling alongside / through a number of open fields, several streams, ponds, and stone fences. The changes in elevation were moderate and the trail well maintained. Time passed quickly as both the scenery and temperature were conducive to getting into and maintaining a good rhythm. There are more rocks than I had anticipated, but that is probably because PA gets so much hype on the subject.   More on rocks later!Just past the High Point State Park Headquarters there is a 220 foot tower that sits atop the highest point in NJ. There was a green-blazed trail to the tower but I did not take it.A personal highlight for me today was coming across ""After"",   He has volunteered his time for the last five years to help maintain the trail and had just completed some serious cutting back of thick grass along the trail with a monster ""weed-whacker"". ""After"" is also a section hiker who started the AT in 2005 and will complete the entire trail later this year. It is people like him that make the experience for the rest of us both possible and safer.   Another highlight was seeing so many stone walls that are popular in New England. A little research on them revealed the following: ""WHEN WERE MOST BUILT ?New England’s stone walls span nearly four hundred years of construction history, during which many walls have been built, rebuilt, taken apart,and rebuilt multiple times. Most walls however, accumulated as residue along fencelines during the century between 1750 and 1850 when southern, interior, and coastal New England was then a landscape of agricultural villages and family farms, carved from what had previously been a forested wilderness. The half-century between the onset of the American Revolution in 1775 and the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 was the time of most rapid construction, during which many of these earlier, haphazard walls, were rebuilt. HOW MANY WALLS ARE THERE ?In 1939 the mining engineer Oliver Bowles estimated that there were probably more than 259,000 miles of stone walls in the northeastern U.S., most of which is in New England. Many walls have since been destroyed, but probably more than half of these remain. WHY SO MANY IN NEW ENGLAND ?Traditionally, New England is considered as the six states of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Geologically, New England also includes the adjacent parts of New York (Long Island and the land east of the Hudson River) and adjacent parts of maritime Canada. Within this region, many walls survive because the farms were abandoned to forest, rather than converted to other uses. And they were common in the first place because the agricultural culture was broadly distributed, and required nearly wholescale deforestation (which exposed the stony subsoils to frost heaving and erosion). WHY SO FEW WALLS ELSEWHERE?The southern limit of widely distributed field stone walls — Northern New Jersey has them whereas the southern part of the state does not — coincides to the south with the limit of ice sheet glaciation and to the west with a transition from generally hard irregular bedrock to softer flat-lying bedrock. The transition to the north is from a tillage/pasture land use to wild lands.""","Sunrise Mntn - then Eileen's B&B!

The highlight of the day was a walk about 5 miles later through a swamp near the Pochuck Creek that included a boardwalk nearly a mile long.   This part of the AT was populated by families and friends walking dogs, reading books, taking pictures, and just having a good time.I believe the temperature got close to 90 and by early afternoon the day was quite humid.

The temperature and humidity continued to make the hiking a bit more challenging than expected from just the terrain, although the first part of the day, in particular, was rocky with abrupt ups and downs making it difficult to get into a flow. I drank over 2 gallons of water and still felt like I wasn't gettimg quite enough. A bit of heat rash and some blisters from new shoes added a nice touch to the challenge.Along the way, went through the Lemon Squeezer (picture in journal) which I had to take my pack off to, well, sque eze through! Later, Views of the Hudson River Valley from the ridge of West Mountain, and then of Bear Mountain, were spectacular. Because of the Holiday Weekend, the trail was densely populated with both large and small groups of friends, as well as individuals. New Yorkers, especially closer to the city, can have a reputation of being a little ""distant"", perhaps even abrupt. Fahgettaboudit! That is not what my experience was yesterday. I got a lot of questions about my journey, and offers for everything from oranges, to water, to ""anything you need"", to my favorite offer of the day which was bagels - At the summit of West Mountain, a middle-aged couple from New Rochelle, their son, and his girlfriend were resting. When they found out I was a Thruhiker, they welcomed me to New York and said that part of my experience had to be eating a good bagel...""nothing like a New York bagel"" said the mom as she reached into her pack and pulled out a bag for me to choose from - I couldn't decide between cinnamon-raisen and sesame, so had to take one of each!The bagels helped fuel the final 2.5 miles of the day which had started at 6:45 am and was closing in on 5:00 pm. Awaiting me at Hessian Lake in Bear Mountain Recreation Area was my high school friend and college roommate for 4 years, Chip Dean. Chip had packed a cooler with ice tea, a couple of beers, two sandwiches, grapes, and a box of Entenmanns Donuts from his daughter Rebecca (chocolate frosted, my favorite). He drove all the way up from Long Island, and even hiked in nearly seven miles to try to find me, before turning back and getting ready to great me at the end of the day. I consumed all of the above in a Block Island Beach Chair that Chip specially packed for me, and then we went out later for som BBQ.

The temperature was in the mid 70s and while the sun was out all day, the trail was heavily shaded. The water sources were plentiful and the changes in elevation ongoing but quite manageable. The scenery included everything from ponds and streams to beautiful swamps, densely forested woods to open farmland, several railroad crosses as well as major highway crossings (Tacomic Parkway and I-84). While I griped about graffiti a week,or so ago, there was a memorable painting of the US flag memorializimg 9-11 atop Shenandoah Mountain, just north of the State Park I started in.The two major highlights were seeing a ""Dover Oak"" tree on the trail that is estimated to be over 300 years old and has a girth of 20' 6"" and passing by a beautiful lake whose history and name I learned at the end of the day and will share below from info found on the web.

But in the middle is Tony's which is great and open 20 hours a day, if for some reason, I can't sleep later.Here's some info on Nuclear Lake I hope you find interesting - ""In 1958, an experimental nuclear fuel research lab was set up on the shores of a lake in Pawling, NY, by Nuclear Development Associates. According to this 1955 NY Times article, the remote site was chosen because “it was the largest convenient and available tract that was not crossed by public roads and could be adequately guarded for secret experiments,” which would involve “uranium and other radioactive materials.” All was apparently fissioning along just fine until the early 1970s, when two serious accidents occurred at the site. First, in 1971, a rubber stopper came off of a plutonium powder container, contaminating a lab room with radioactive material. Then, in 1972, a chemical explosion occurred in the building adjacent to the lake,,causing an unknown amount of plutonium powder to spew out into the air and presumably onto the surrounding grounds. Nuclear Lake had earned its name.Little seems to be known about the accident, though local legend has it that at least one person died, and that there was a cover-up. In the comments left to this Nuclear Lake post, one local recalls his mother, a nurse, saying that one of the victims came into the hospital with his watch melted down to his bone; another rumor has it that the ambulance he was transported in is buried on the site (you can read about a horrifying accident at a similar facility here).A clean-up commenced at a cost of $3,000,000, and the land was deemed safe for “unrestricted use.” The company closed down the plant shortly after, and the land was sold to the National Park Service for inclusion into the Appalachian Trail. Though documents were found that suggested the company may have also been dumping radioactive waste water into the lake, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission study gave it a clean bill of health in 1994.""All I can say is that it was one of the prettier water bodies I have seen on the entire AT!","Clarence Fahnestock State Park

While there were only a few significant changes in elevation, there was very little flat traveling throughout the day adding a degree of difficulty I was not expecting from the Guidebook. The temperature remained warm but again not as humid as over the weekend.

The Appalchian Trail Conservancy was promoting such an approach earlier this years to help even out some of the foot traffic on the trail which is growing each year and was expected to surge in 2016 as a result of the several recent hiking movies, one with Reese and one with what's his name...

Streams for refilling water were plentiful although with a little drizzle during most of the morning and cooler temps, need to hydrate was less than its been. 
For anyone mildly interested in the River - here's some Wikipedia info:
Indigenous people began using the river area for fishing and hunting at least 6,000 years ago. By 1600, the inhabitants were mostly Mohicans and may have numbered 30,000.[7]
The river's name is derived from the Mohican phrase ""usi-a-di-en-uk"", translated as ""beyond the mountain place"" or ""river of the mountain place"".[7][8] It is referred to in the deed by which a group of twelve colonists called ""The Proprietors"" captured the land now called Shermanand New Fairfield as ""Ousetonack"".[9] It was referred to by Samuel Orcutt as ""more properly the Howsatunnuck"" and an early name of ""Oweantinock"" is also mentioned.[10] The river was also known as the Potatuck or the ""river of the falls"" until the 18th century.[8][11]
The river passes through land that was formerly occupied primarily by native people of Algonquian lineage, typically living in villages of two to three hundred families housed in hide wigwams.[11][12] These native inhabitants burned the forests along the Housatonic Valley in the autumn to keep the underbrush down, a practice which was customary throughout Connecticut prior to European settlement.[13]
One notable native was Chief Squantz of the Schaghticoke tribe, who still hold a portion of the former reservation on the west side of the Housatonic River, in what is now called the town of Kent.[9]","Mt Argo Shelter

Although farmers took up arms in states from New Hampshire to South Carolina, the rebellion was most serious in Massachusetts, where bad harvests, economic depression, and high taxes threatened farmers with the loss of their farms. The rebellion took its name from its symbolic leader, Daniel Shays of Massachusetts, a former captain in the Continental army.The uprising in Massachusetts began in the summer of 1786. The rebels tried to capture the federal arsenal at Springfield and harassed leading merchants, lawyers, and supporters of the state government. The state militia, commanded by Gen. Benjamin Lincoln, crushed the rebels in several engagements in the winter of 1787. Shays and the other principal figures of the rebellion fled first to Rhode Island and then to Vermont.Although it never seriously threatened the stability of the United States, Shays’ Rebellion greatly alarmed politicians throughout the nation. Proponents of constitutional reform at the national level cited the rebellion as justification for revision or replacement of the Articles of Confederation, and Shays’ Rebellion figured prominently in the debates over the framing and ratification of the Constitution""Sent from my iPad","Salisbury amd then Bearded Woods

Finished the day at ""Shaker Campsite"" where there is just one other hiker staying tonight - a woman whose trail name is ""Merry Christmas"" from PA. Merry Christmas takes a week each year to hike a section of the AT. The trail was relatively bland today which is not a bad thing after picking up a large resupply. The weather was mid-70s with a slight breeze. Plenty of water along the trail as there has been for several days. The two highlights of the day involved Beavers and Shakers.1) Beavers - At mile 1533.7 I came upon a pond which had a number of old, dead trees standing in it, and a number of old dead trees laying in its south end. As I glanced back toward the pond's edge along the trail, I spotted the biggest beaver I had ever seen. By the time I got my mini-IPad out of my pack, the beaver had slid into the water...so all I can give you is a head shot and then an image I found on the web which approximates his/her size. I was amazed at how big a number of the fallen trees were and how precise their trunks had been cut.Some fun facts about beavers you may not have known from Wikipedia - Beaver (genus Castor) is a primarily nocturnal, large, semiaquatic rodent. Beavers are known for building dams, canals, and lodges (homes). They are the second-largest rodent in the world (after the capybara). Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material. The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6–12 million. This population decline is the result of extensive hunting for fur, for glands used as medicine and perfume, and because the beavers' harvesting of trees and flooding of waterways may interfere with other land uses.   They use powerful front teeth to cut trees and other plants that they use both for building and for food. In the absence of existing ponds, beavers must construct dams before building their lodges. First they place vertical poles, then fill between the poles with a crisscross of horizontally placed branches. They fill in the gaps between the branches with a combination of weeds and mud until the dam impounds sufficient water to surround the lodge.2) Shakers - I am camping just above what is believed to be the ruins of a small barn that was part of a Shaker Village that existed here for about 100 years beginning in the late 1700's. See picture in photo journal. Shakers lived communally in dormitories and their worship involved dancing...you might guess that they weren't greeted with open arms in these parts at that time.   They were primarily farmers, but also produced maple syrup. While their demise is not well recorded, they were completely out of this area by 1876.Sent from my iPad","US 7, then Jess Treat Hostel

Heavily forested, so even when the sun shown, it was cool and shady. Highlights of the day included a walk along what I imagine Walden Pond looked like, crossing over the Mass Pike and seeing the AT sign - this time from the trail, and seeing more beaver works of art on trees by ponds that use to be streams. The Mass Pike sign was particularly moving as it is the one I would pass traveling from Boston to visit my dad in Upstate New York in his last years of life.Sent from my iPad","Shaker Campsite,

It was interesting to see a number of very old but well-kept homes as well as an old mill building which looked like it still had some type of ongoing manufacturing. The Moumtains in this section of the AT are known as The Berkshires.

There may actually be some frost on the Bershires tomorro ,as the temperature is dropping rapidly due to a cold fromt moving through.   Wikepedia has this to say about these mountains:""The Berkshires is a highland geologic region located in the western parts of Massachusetts and Connecticut. The term ""Berkshires"" is normally used by locals in reference to the portion of the mountain range that lies within Massachusetts. The portion of the Berkshires that extends into Connecticut is commonly referred to by locals as either the Northwest Hills or Litchfield HillDuring the American Revolution a Continental Army force under Henry Knox brought captured cannons from Fort Ticonderoga by ox-drawn sleds south along the west bank of the Hudson River from the fort to Albany where he then crossed the Hudson. Knox and his men continued east through the Berkshires and finally arrived in Boston. This feat, known as the ""Noble train of artillery"", was accomplished in the dead of winter, 1775-1776.""After reading that American Revolution story, I promise not to whine tomorrow after climbing Mount Greylock, which at 3491 feet is the highest peak in MA.One of my favorite things about this part of the trail are the Birch Trees.

I have been taking pictures of mushrooms lately as it seemed the right thing to do with all the rain and mushy conditions. Am currently having challenges uploading them and will try again tomorrow. A little Wikipedia on these creatures follows. Let's call this piece the Fungus Among-us!fungus (/'f??g?s/; plural: fungi[3] or funguses[4]) is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes unicellular microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as multicellular fungi that produce familiar fruiting forms such as mushrooms. Similar to animals, fungi are heterotrophs, that is, they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment. Growth is their means of mobility, except for spores, which may travel through the air or water (a few of which are flagellated). Fungi are principal decomposers and are genetically more closely related to animals than to plants.Abundant worldwide, most fungi are inconspicuous because of the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil, on dead matter. They are both symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles, as a leavening agent for bread, in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.","Cooper Lodge Shelter, Mount Kiilington

Modeled after similar huts in the Alps, they are positioned at intervals along the Appalachian Trail, allowing ""thru-hikers"" (those who hike the entire Appalachian Trail) to benefit from their services. They are generally separated by six to eight miles, about a day's hike.Hikers can reserve overnight bunks at the huts, which hold from 36 to 96 people each. In summer season (June through mid-September) the huts are ""full service"", serving dinner and breakfast. Three huts stay open the rest of the year as ""self service"", allowing guests to cook their own food in the kitchen.The huts are staffed by a team of five to nine caretakers - often called ""the croo,"" using that spelling[1] - during full-service season. Each crew member works for eleven days on, three days off. During the eleven working days, they must make four trips back down the mountain to get perishable food and other supplies, carrying heavy loads. At the beginning of each season, fuel and supplies are flown into the huts by helicopter. The huts were built and are maintained by the Appalachian Mountain Club's construction crew.The huts are very popular, having handled thousands of hikers entering the back woods and environmentally sensitive areas above tree line. Four years and an environmental impact statement were required to get the huts' permits renewed by the U.S. Forest Service in 1999.[2]Sent from my iPhone","Lakes of Clouds Hut

Hiked 12.3 miles from Gentian Pond Shelter to the north end of the Mahoosuc Notch where I am camping. The Notch is described as the most difficult or fun mile of the AT as you make your way through a jumbled pit of boulders. I think it was both - most difficult and most fun. It took me about 90 minutes to get through. Three times I had to take off my pack and push it through a tiny opening between boulders before pulling myself through. There was lots of boulder-hopping and some swinging on branches. Tarzan would have had a blast here! There was still ice in a number of the crevices between the boulders which was surprising to see this late in the year. The cold air around it was quite refreshing. One very big milestone today was crossing into Maine from NH. Maine is the last of 14 states for Northbounders on the AT, covering 282 miles, including something called the 100 mile wilderness which precedes the 4000 foot finale up Mount Katahdin.

Kim also hiked a few hours with me near Dunn Notch and Falls outside of Andover. The early morning 2600 foot climb from Grafton Notch to the summits of Baldplate east and west was done in a light drizzle. By the time I got to The top of Baldplate, the wind was gusting in excess of 25 knots and the rain was seemingly coming down sideways. Visibility along the granite summit dropped to about 50 yards, enough to see from one cairn to the next, but that's about it. The temperature with wind chill felt like it was in the 40's - tough stuff! On a clear day, I imagine the views are beautiful, but that's all I could do today - imagine. Coming down from the summit, the granite trail sloped steeply and at a sideways angle. Water was flowing over the stone and I had to do everything not to fall. The afternoon was dry, more gradually sloped, and a bit less windy.

Today's quotes 
1. Does anything in nature despair except man? An animal with a foot caught in a trap does not seem to despair. It is too busy trying to survive. It is all closed in, to a kind of still, intense waiting. Is this a key? Keep busy with survival. Imitate the trees. Learn to lose in order to recover, and remember that nothing stays the same for long, not even pain, psychic pain. Sit it out. Let it all pass. Let it go. May Sarton, Journal of a Solitude
2. We shall never achieve harmony with the land, anymore than we shall achieve absolute justice or liberty for people. In these higher aspirations the important thing is not to achieve but to strive. Aldo Leopold

Some of these ""ponds"" seemed pretty big to me so I went to ""Mr. Lakefront.net"" which is a Maine lakefront property site to learn the following:Q.What the difference between a pond and a lake?A.Folks ""from away"" mistakenly believe that ponds are small and shallow and lakes are big and deep. The truth is that here in Maine the words pond and lake are used synonymously. So don't discriminate against ponds. Ponds can often be larger than some lakes. For example, Panther Pond in Raymond is 1,439 acres which is larger than Pleasant Lake of 1,077 acres, Highland Lake in Bridgton of 1,401 acres or Crescent Lake of 716 acres. Long Lake, the region's 2nd largest lake with 4,867 acres is only 59 feet deep while Coffee Pond with only 137 acres is 70 feet deep.By the way, I think you either have to be born in Maine or live her for 50 years to not be labeled ""From away.""

For those interested I some AT fun facts:  Fascinating Appalachian Trail FactsPosted by: Kenny Howell April 10, 2014 Source is Kenny Howell1. The Appalachian Trail is……a nearly 2,200 mile hiking trail through the Appalachian Mountain Range in the Eastern United States.2. It is the longest “hiking-only” footpath in the world.It is also among the longest continuously marked trails. The AT is marked with approximately 165,000 2 x 6 inch white blazes along the trail guiding hikers all 2,186 miles.1,23. The Trail travels through 14 different states:1. Georgia2. North Carolina 3. Tennessee 4. Virginia 5. West Virginia  6. Maryland 7. Pennsylvania8. New Jersey9. New York10Connecticut11 Massachusetts12Vermont13New Hampshire14 Maine 4. The Appalachian Trail is the largest AND longest running volunteer conservation project in the world. The entirety of the trail is maintained by an army of volunteers organized into 31 distinct maintenance clubs. Clubs do everything from maintaining existing trails and painting blazes to excavating trail reroutes and building new shelters. Each club is responsible for maintaining specific sections of trail as small as the Wilmingtons Trail Club’s 7.2 miles and as large as the Maine Appalachian Trail Club’s 266.8 miles.5. The elevation gain/loss of hiking the entire Appalachian Trail is the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest 16 times. The summit of Mount Everest sits at 29,029 feet. Doing a little math that means that the elevation changes hikers traverse along the AT totals up to an approximate 464,464 feet!56. Less than 15,000 people have completed a successful thru-hike. According to the records kept by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) as of this writing there have been 14,485 successful thru-hikes of the Appalachian Trail since its creation. That’s 14,485 people out of all people that have ever existed. Ever. Even if you throw in estimates of how many people may have completed a hike without reporting it to the ATC it still makes for quite the impressive figure 7. It’s estimated that about 99% of the entire trail has been either relocated or rebuilt since its completion.Many of the most scenic sections of trail we enjoy today were not originally a part of the trail. This includes Tennessee’s Roan Mountain, Virginia’s Grayson Highlands, New Jersey’s Pochuck Creek swamp, and Maine’s Saddleback Mountain.8. The AT cuts through the oldest mountain range on the planet. While it is fairly difficult to prove that it is, in fact, the “oldest” it is at least considered one of the oldest mountain ranges in the world. How old? Well it is believed the the Appalachian Mountain Range predatesthe creation of the North American continent! In its early years The Appalachian Mountains were likely stunning peaks reminiscent of the Rocky Mountains. However, centuries upon centuries of weather, ice, and erosion have rounded the peaks giving us the mountains we know and love today.99. No one seems to actually know why the southern Appalachian bald mountains existThe grassy balds of the southern Appalachian Mountains are some of the most exciting destinations along the early parts of the Appalachian Trail. A “bald” essentially describes a high-elevation area that is devoid of prominent vegetation such as trees. The Roan Highlands, Big Bald, and the Grayson Highlands are all included in this category. Balds such as these are considered oddities.Up north bald mountains such as those found in the White Mountains are not uncommon. The colder, harsher climates of New Hampshire and Maine create an alpine environment that commonly causes the effect. Yet in the warmer climate of the South this result is abnormal. Theories abound about how these famous mountain tops may have been cleared. Some believe they were high enough to be susceptible to lightning strikes and fires. Others believe overgrazing of livestock inhibited growth. Still others say logging is to blame. The truth is there is apparently little evidence to support any of these claims to eliminate the idea that it may actually be a naturally occurring phenomenon.101110. The idea for the Appalachian Trail and the Long Trail were conceived atop the same mountainIt was atop Stratton Mountain in Vermont that these two famous scenic trails got their start. In 1909 James P. Taylorfound himself on the mountain when he birthed the idea of a trail stretching from Massachusetts to Canada. This would later become The Long Trail in Vermont. It was during the construction of the Long Trail that Benton Mackaye stood atop the very same mountain finding the inspiration for the beginnings of the Appalachian Trail. The two trails are contiguous for about 100 miles. Stratton Mountain may not be the most awe-inspiring view along the trail, but it is certainly one of the most significant.14Nature Quotes for todayThe tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing that stands in the way. Some see nature all ridicule and deformity... and some scarce see nature at all. But to the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself.

When an Indian village became too deep in its own filth, the inhabitants moved. And we have no place to which to move.""John Steinbeck   If you are interested in learning a bit more about Moxie, the name of the shelter I'm in and the nearby pond, see this from Wikipedia:Moxie a brand of carbonated beverage that was among the first mass-produced soft drinksin the United States. It continues to be regionally popular today. It is produced by the Moxie Beverage Company of Bedford, New Hampshire, which (through several levels of wholly owned subsidiaries) is part of the Kirin Holdings Company of Tokyo, Japan. As a result of widespread brand advertising, the brand name has become the word ""moxie"" in the English language, meaning ""courage, daring, or spirit"".Moxie's flavor is unique, as it is not as sweet as most modern soft drinks and is described by some as bitter. Moxie is flavored with gentian root extract, an extremely bitter substance which was reputed to possess medicinal properties. It originated around 1876 as a patent medicine called ""Moxie Nerve Food"".[2]Moxie is closely associated with the state of Maine and was designated the official soft drink of Maine on May 10, 2005.[3] Its creator, Dr. Augustin Thompson, was born in Union, Maine, but Moxie was created and first produced in Lowell, Massachusetts.[4]Moxie originated as a patent medicine called ""Moxie Nerve Food"",[2] which was created around 1876 by Dr. Augustin Thompson in Lowell, Massachusetts.[4] Thompson claimed that it contained an extract from a rare, unnamed South American plant. Moxie, he claimed, was especially effective against ""paralysis, softening of the brain, nervousness, and insomnia"".[2]Thompson claimed that he named the beverage after a Lieutenant Moxie,[2] a purported friend of his, who he claimed had discovered the plant and used it as a panacea, and the company he created continued to promulgate legendary stories about the word's origin. It likely derives from an Abenaki word that means ""dark water"" and which is found in lake and river names in Maine, where Thompson was born and raised.[5]After a few years, Thompson added soda waterto the formula and changed the product's name to ""Beverage Moxie Nerve Food"". By 1884 he was selling Moxie both in bottles and in bulk as a soda fountain syrup. In 1885, he received a trade mark for the term. He marketed it as ""a delicious blend of bitter and sweet, a drink to satisfy everyone's taste"".[6] Thompson died in 1903.[7]","Caratunk Maine

His study is limited to north bound thru-hikers (NOBOs) who completed their hike in one hiking season.""1. The mean number of days for these thruhikers was 168.18 days while the median number was 171.   Mine - Counting next Saturday's hike up Mount Katahdin, my trip lasted 126 days. Counting my five zero's, I averaged 17.37 miles per day. Taking the zero's out, I averaged 18.09 miles per day. Not bad on a tank of 5000 calories per day.2. Here's the distribution of hikers grouped by the month they left Springer mountain in Georgia and the month they reached Mount Katahdin: 2 hikers in this study left Springer in January 30 in February144 in March (60%)57 in April7 in May Me - I left March 143. Steve looked at the journals for the hikers in his study to see if He could determine how old each hiker was. In the end, here is what he estimated:45% were under 3026% were age 30-4929% were 50 and olderMe - I am 55 (ssshhhhh!)4. Here are the average (mean) times, and number of mean zero days, it took these various age groups to finish their thru-hikes:Under 30 -- 167 days to complete and 20 zero days30-49 -- 170 days to complete and 21 zero days50 and over -- 174 days to complete and 21 zero daysMe - I took 5 zero days, three to watch Alex graduate and see Kim for Mother's Day which involved driving to Boston from VA and back, one on Memorial Day as I had bad heat rash, and one on Father's Day with Kim in Hanover, NH5. Fewer than 10 percent of the hikers in his study completed the traiI in under 130 days. Here are how the numbers for ""quick"" hikers in the study broke down:52% were in the younger age group (under 30)29% were in the middle age group (30-49)19% were in the older age group (50 and over)Me - No one has ever called me quick before, especially on the basketball court..6. The mean number of nights that hikers in the study spent in various places broke down like this:Shelters: 62 nightsTents or Hammocks: 53 nightsMotels: 23 nightsHostels: 21 nightsPrivate Homes: 9 nightsMine looks like this - Shelters and tents: 67 nights or 53 percent Motels: 18 nights or 14 percent (I included B&B's here)Hostels:   31 nights or 25 percentPrivate Homes: 10 nights or 8 percent","Katahdin Stream Campground, them hostrl

NOWA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542774,"51 questions with NOWA: While I was hoping this next piece would have some of the spontaneity and spunk of Vogue's ""73 Questions with Taylor Swift"" (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XnbCSboujF4), I'm no T Swizzle and some of these questions deserve more than a pithy response. Sorry for the length but it covers about 4 months of walking in the woods...Leslie Bonacum is the interviewer.1. NOAH like the biblical figure? No, NOWA like No One Walks Alone. My trail name, which just about everyone on the AT has, represents the community of family, friends, and healthcare professionals that walk with the Alzheimer's patient on their journey during their last phases of life. My dad passed away from this terrible disease and I coupled my walk with raising money for the Alzheimer's Association to support their mission. Friends and family also gave me the names of over 125 people they knew who have the disease or who have died from it. It was an honor and an inspiration to carry these names in my backpack from GA to ME. 2. What surprised you most about the journey? How quickly people from all walks of life adopt the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of the tribe they are suddenly part of. One of the strongest beliefs of the trail culture is that you should ""hike your own hike."" It's a good metaphor for life.3. Most valuable piece of advice given to you before or after the trip? ""Hike your hike"" meaning it's your journey - experience it in a way that is respectful of others and of the environment, while enjoying the trail in a way that best suits you and your purpose for hiking. 4. Most valuable piece of gear? My hiking poles! They helped propel me up hills and soften the impact on my knees during downhills. I was also prepared to fend off an overly aggressive Ruffed Grouse if she took one step closer to me. Can't imagine hiking without them. 5. How many pairs of shoes did you go through? Five. The hiking experience may be priceless but it's not cheap.6. How much weight did you lose? I had lost about 17 pounds in the first month before bouncing back with changes to my diet, and the assistance of family and friends who were genuinely concerned about me. I am now down about 10 pounds which I'd like to figure out how to maintain without exercising 10-12 hours a day! My waist size is the smallest it's been since high school!7. Were you lonely? I was alone much of the time, but never lonely. There's a quote by Anne Frank that I think help explains that and it goes, ""The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be."" I wasn't afraid, lonely, or unhappy before the hike, but being ""...quiet, alone with the heavens, nature, and God"" made things feel even more ""...as they should be.""8. How much money did you raise for the Alzheimer's Association? As of July 18, just over $30,000 with more donations coming in. Go to dougswalk.com if you are interested in donating. 9. What advice would you give to would be hikers? Know yourself. And put away your ear buds - the sounds of nature are as peaceful as the sights. 10. Your favorite trail angel? My sister Beth! She drove to Hanover NH from upstate NY to join me and my wife Kim for a day on the trail and to leave some great home-baked trail magic at the trailhead out of Hanover for others to enjoy. I also want to give a shout-out to the Russian immigrants Leo and Anna who I met in early June on the trail and enjoyed their trail magic only to find they later placed a huge stash of magic with my name on it about 100 miles up the trail. I was very popular on the trail that day. 11. Hardest moment? Suffering heat rash all over my body and chafing in some areas so badly I was bleeding, followed closely by being so cold in a shelter one night in The Smokey Mountains during a snow storm that the thought of becoming hyperthermic became a little too real. These were the hardest in a physical way. Mentally and emotionally, it's the ""tranquil tedium"" of walking miles and miles a day, day after day, after day, that makes or breaks you. 12. Favorite moment on the trail? Anytime I read a word of encouragement from friends and family who were following my hike on Facebook or TrailJournals. I also used a meditative phrase throughout the trip that went like this: ""Present moment, beautiful moment. Present moment, beautiful moment. Present moment, what a moment."" So I got to the point, no matter how spectacular or bad things seemed to get, the present moment was in fact my favorite, because it's all I had. 13. Favorite moment off the trail? Surprising my son Alex and wife Kim by having Enterprise Car Rental pick me up from the trail in Front Royal VA and me then driving to Alex's college graduation in Boston. My favorite moment Somewhere between off and on the trail was getting an $8 haircut by a 90 year old barber in Port Clinton, PA. I also want to give a shout-out to my college roommate, Chip Dean, who drove and walked hours to find me, and had two of my favorite foods - IPA and Chocolate frosted Entenmann's donuts.    14. Most emotional moment? Walking the footbridge over the MA turnpike that I would drive under to visit my father in his last years of life. I cried like a baby.15. Most beautiful spot? Well, the present moment of course, wherever that was, but in terms of ""Kodak"" moments I'd say there's no one spot that stands so clearly above the others. For me, some of the more beautiful included the first time I saw Mount Katahdin, the summit of Mount Lafayette in NH with incredible panoramic views of the White Mountains, Sages Ravine along the CT-MA border, Sunfish Pond in NJ, Grayson Highlands State Park in VA, many of the reclaimed pastures that the ATC has established, and anywhere I was when I saw a white trail blaze on a tree after an uncomfortably long time of not seeing one! That was always met with me saying to the blaze, ""there you are my friend."" Is that weird?16. Did you think about stopping? Probably every day between the middle of Virginia up to descending Mount Madison in NH which was brutal - big crooked boulders, stupidly steep, and strides that often involved both feet off the ground at the same time. Hiking the AT is absolutely no ""walk in the woods."" It's by far the hardest thing I've ever done including struggling 4 years through Chemical Engineering in college, bicycling across the US, and being under water in a submarine for 90 days at a time going 4 knots to nowhere in the North Atlantic during the Cold War. Here's an extract from a book by through-hiker Zach Davis that provides some perspective: ""It’s the thick, sweltering heat while scaling a shadeless, rock-face mountain. It’s trying to sleep through sub-freezing temperatures, hoping that wearing every damn article of clothing in your pack and wrapping your sleeping bag over your head will provide enough warmth to grant a few hours of sleep. It’s the constant swarm of mosquitoes, flies, and gnats. It’s the boredom that comes from another day of walking through lackluster terrain. It’s the pain that strangleholds every muscle of your body upon waking. It’s putting on sweat soaked clothes for the fifth morning in a row. It’s trying to sleep next to that snoring asshole six inches from your face. It’s waking up in a shelter to sound of a mouse eating his way through your backpack. It’s pooping in the rain; have fun trying to wipe. It’s drinking discolored stream water. It’s wandering a mile off trail before realizing you have no idea where you are. It’s checking your nether regions for parasitic and disease carrying ticks at the end of an exhausting day. It’s living in a constant coat of filth. It’s walking consecutive days with a set of throbbing blisters between your toes and on the sides of your heals. It’s veering off trail to go to the bathroom, only to look down and notice that you’re standing in poison ivy. It’s rocks eating through your boots and insoles, making it feel as though you’re hiking barefoot. It’s running through a storm while hearing lighting crash down on every side of you. It’s the rustling of an animal prowling outside of your tent just moments before you were going to fall asleep. These are the reasons people throw in the towel, not because a climb is too daunting...""17. Did you pray. For what? Everyday, after I got settled in to the rhythm and flow of the trail which probably took me about two weeks. It was always in the morning as I began hiking and always went something like this - ""Open my eyes to what they have been blind to; My ears to what and who they have been deaf to; My mouth to what it will not or can not say; My heart to love in new ways; and My Spirit to believe more richly and deeply.""18. Were you ever scared? Once when I met a young man in fatigues in the middle of nowhere who had nothing but the clothes on his back with him. He was just so out of place that it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up; and several times when I was so wet and cold that my hands stopped being able to do things like zipper my jacket. 19. Secret to your success? Three things -   A. Good luck;B. Having a purpose bigger than just myself to hike for (supporting the mission of the Alzheimer's Association); and, C. Having such a supportive group of family and friends. To that end, let me give a special shout out to my wife Kim who was behind me all the way, ensured my mail-drops always showed up where and when they were suppose to be, joined me on the trail several days, and took me off the trail several days when I really needed it; and to my three sisters (Lynn, Leslie, and Beth) who sent me great snacks via maildrops with inspiring letters and cards; to my cousin Eileen who slack-packed me across the entire Garden State; and to my friend Carol who did the same in Vermont. And finally, to Kristin at Kaiser Permanente where I worked until March 11th, for all the technical support she gave me in advance of the hike and for her linking me to The Alzheimer's Association.I also had three simple rules to guide me:Stay safeStay dryStay hydrated.All rules actually follow from ""stay safe.""20. What did you think about? Most often, nothing, for long periods of time actually, which I quite enjoyed! In the words of Bill Bryson, ""...you exist in a kind of mobile Zen mode, your brain like a balloon tethered with string, accompanying but not actually part of the body below. Walking for hours and miles becomes as automatic, as unremarkable, as breathing.”When faced with physically challenging parts of the trail, I'd think about the next micro-goal or hurdle in front of me and nothing else. When emotionally challenged, I used the ""at least"" principle - if it were raining cats and dogs I'd say something like ""well at least there's no lightening"", or ""at least there will be plenty of water in the springs and streams to drink;"" or if I mistakingly got off the trail, ""well at least I know I'm lost and just need to retrace my steps"", or if an ascent up a mountain was ridiculously steep, ""well at least it's only for another mile."" When I purposefully and proactively thought, which was more in the last quarter of my adventure, it was about things like what kind of school teacher I wanted to become, what I had to be grateful for, and what I had learned on the trail.21. What surprised you in a good way? The generosity of complete strangers, the incredible simplicity of life on the trail, and how positive, positive self talk can be. 22. What surprised you in a negative /neutral way? People leaving trash in shelters and writing offensive stuff on the walls inside of privies. 23. What would you have done differently? Incorporated down hill work-outs more in my training. Knee problems almost did me in during the first 45 days on the trail and it was all related to descending steep gradients. I would have also liked to have taken a photography class and spent a little time learning what birds, plants, and trees I was going to see so that I could name them when I did finally see them.24. Did the experience change you? It certainly has impacted me. Whether it changes me is left to be determined as I re-enter the world I largely left for 126 days. Later this week I'll share what I think I've learned and what I hope to do with it. 25. Mental or physical strength - which was more important? To the people who leave the trail because of Lyme disease, a fall which dislocates a shoulder, shin splints, knee / foot problems and the like, it's clearly physical. That said, for me, and for most through hikers, it's mental strength and resilience which gets you through the hike. 26. Who were the most memorable people you met? Every single trail angel I had the pleasure of seeing face to face and every single person who picked me up while hitchhiking. Memorable because they made me feel like I mattered to them and they cared about me even though I was a complete stranger. I hope to find that same place in my heart and spirit for others. 27. What do you wish someone had told you before you hit the trail? A mouse will eventually crawl on your face in a shelter, so tent whenever you can..and don't scream like a child when it does happen - they're harmless and you are a big boy.28. Would you do it again? No. It was an awesome experience but there are far too many things I have never done to spend another 4 months of my life re-walking the AT.29. How many thru hikers are there in any given year? I believe the Appalachian trail conservancy was expecting between 3 and 4 thousand this year. About 20 percent will complete what they started. 30. Most interesting animal you saw or experienced? The ruffed grouse which chased me numerous times in numerous States in protection of her chicks and the orange salamanders which made me smile every time I saw one. I also really enjoyed the wood-carving of beavers and getting to see one for the first time. 31. Scariest animal experience? Coming inches away from stepping on a snake and meeting a porcupine face to face.32. Did you ever ask yourself - why did I think this was a good idea? Often33. An ideal day would end with...a shower, clean laundry, and something other than freeze-dried food eaten directly out of the bag.34. What time would you usually start / stop hiking. That changed as Spring turned into Summer, but most recently I'd say I was hiking by 6:00 a.m. and finishing between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m.35. Why are Snickers bars a trail favorite? High content, fat, and protein; both sweet and a little salty; a near perfect food for the weight!36. Favorite trail food / Worst trail food? My favorite snack were Dream Bars that were mail-dropped to me by my sister Leslie. The first three ingredients are butter, wheat flour, and brown sugar. 400 calories of pure deliciousness. They also have rolled oats, chocolate, coconut, and a gewy caramel in them. My Favorite trail dinner was a tie between a freeze-dried Cuban Beans and Rice dish and freeze- dried Pad Thai. My least favorite was trying to down powdered milk mixed in water to boost my fat intake. Yuck. 37. Did you ever hike for long distances with someone you met on the trail? No, although this is rather common on the trail. Not my style. What did happen however, was often going days, weeks, and even months without seeing someone whose company I enjoyed, only to see them again when least expected. That was always very nice.38. In one word, how would you describe the experience? Life-changing. Is hyphenating cheating the one word aspect of the question?39. Did you talk to yourself out-loud a lot? Only under two circumstances. When I finally saw a white trail blaze after an uncomfortably long time of not seeing one (""There you are my friend"") and several times after a hard fall (It always began with an ""F"").   I silently talked to myself positively in the White Mountains after having several difficult days going down tortuous hills and whining to myself and others. It very much helped me stay positive and focused. Warren Doyle who has hiked the trail 17 times advises:- Don’t expect the Trail to respect or to be sensitive to your man-made comfort level and desire to control your environment. In your avoidance of discomfort, you may become more uncomfortable. You can’t make a mountain any less steep; a hot summer afternoon any cooler; a cold morning any warmer; and, daylight any longer. - Time, distance, terrain, weather, and the Trail itself cannot be changed. You have to change. Don’t waste any of your energy complaining over things you have no control over. Instead, look to yourself and adapt your mind, heart, body and soul to the Trail.- The Trail knows neither prejudice nor discrimination. Don’t expect any favors from the Trail. The Trail is inherently hard.40. How many times did you fall / walking poles did you break? I probably fell about 25 times which I still haven't quite figured out other than my pack's weight didn't help. I never tripped and fell, so my mom would be proud that at least I was lifting my feet. I broke 3 carbon poles, all while trying to stop falls, before switching to metal poles in Rangeley, Maine. I still fell but my poles are in one piece.41. Biggest rookie error? Countless. My longest and only overnight hike before this undertaking was around a Lake near Oakland CA where I hiked about 10 miles. That was big mistake. On the trail, my most laughable error was leaving my tent in a densely packed campsite to find a place to pee away from the other hikers. When I turned back to crawl into my tent, all of them looked very similar and it took about 15 minutes to find mine, waking up a few hikers in the process.42. Luckiest moment? Everyday I had the opportunity to walk because I was physically and emotionally able to, I thought about how incredibly lucky I was. Every time I fell and got up, I thought how lucky I was. Every time I picked up a maildrop from family, read a note of encouragement from friends on Facebook, or experienced trail magic, I thought about how lucky I was. When my cousin Eileen slack-packed me throughout NJ and my friend Carol throughout VT I thought about how lucky I was. I think I'll go play the Lottery!43. How long did it take you? 126 days.44. Was that shorter or longer than you thought? Shorter. I originally thought I'd be ending the second week in August, somewhere around day 145 - 150. 45. Woods or outhouse? Both are equally comfortable now for me...and that took awhile. Growing up, I'd be the type of kid who's go away to camp and not poop for a week. Give me good tree to scootch behind now or a privy with at least 3 walls, and all is good.46. Biggest thrill - Finally admitting to myself that I was going to make it, which oddly enough didn't happen until I was half-way through Maine.47. Biggest disappointment - missing the side-trail to McAfee Knob which is one of the most photographed spots on the Appalachian Trail. 48. What weren't you ready for? How much pain and discomfort I was in for the first month and a half of the trip. My feet ached and were heavily blistered, my knees were swollen and incredibly sore everyday. I had sprained my ankles several times and had several bouts of significant diarrhea. I don't think it necessarily has to be that way, but it did help validate the slogan, ""No pain, No rain, No Maine."" 49. What did you miss most on the trail about your (other) life? My family. 50. What did you look forward to most upon finishing? Besides having feeling return to my toes, I look forward to the challenge of turning some of my ""learnings"" into action, becoming a better person in the process, and having a more meaningful and positive impact on the lives of others. 51. My first day off the trail, I...did absolutely nothing, and it felt very good. I think I'll try it again tomorrow.","Camp...

NOWA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542997,"If this post interests anyone, it's probably just long distance hikers...Tomorrow I'll post on the hiker culture and Friday on my lessons learned from the last four months. I had no backpacking experience prior to my 2016 Through Hike and so anything I can offer here may not be of value to those who do. I just greatly benefitted last summer from reading the Trail Journals of other through hikers and wanted to give back something in return. So here are some points of view for those thinking of hiking the AT (or doing other long-distance hiking) in the future that are from my experience over the last four months.1. Get physically ready - I put beans and rice in my pack (uncooked of course!) and hiked up and down the stairwell in my 27 floor office building for months before hitting the trail. In addition to weight training for my legs and glutes, I also did interval training on a variety of cardio-machines. Until my first ""Near-0"" in Hiawassee I was averaging about 17 mpd. While that's not really the point, you don't want to get hurt or frustrated because you're not in shape. That said, of those suffering knee problems early in their hike, including me, most attributed it to downhill hiking which I had not adequately prepared my body for. 2. Get your personal life in order - As early as Hiawassee, GA, day 5 for me, I heard other hikers my age talk about issues back home that were left unresolved when they started their hike and left me convinced they were not going to finish their hike.3. Put your ear buds down while you are walking. It's not safe and you are missing nature's symphony. I live in Oakland, CA where street noise is rather prevalent, but to give up the cry of a loon, the drum of a woodpecker, the roar of a waterfall, or the sound of wind through the trees, is to give up a lot.   4. You are most likely to wander off the trail when their is an interruption or distraction. For me, the top two contributing factors were meeting and greeting other people at a junction in the trail, or getting tunnel vision on something that looked like the trail only to miss the more obvious marking or route. When that happens, retrace your path back to a white blaze, shake it off, and keep moving. 5. Don't hold on to your mistakes. The trail is tough enough without the added burden of self-induced negativity6. I broke 3 carbon hiking poles prior to buying metal. All were involved in falls where I went one way and the pole was jammed between rocks or roots and it went another way. I won't buy them again.7. I went through two pairs of Altra trail shoes and one pair of LaSportivia's in under 600 miles. Loved the look and feel...hated the cost, and while I may go back for day / short section hiking, I'd never buy them again for long distance longevity. 8. I tried to be guided by 3 rules - stay safe; stay dry (especially feet); and stay hydrated. These worked fairly well for me in terms of focusing on some critical success factors.9. I used a Jet Boil the entire trip which I'd do again. It did though, get just enough rust, to make it difficult to properly secure the main ""pot"" to the heating mechanism.10. My wife Kim coordinated maildrops for me that provided 3 - 5 days of food at a time. All but one was sent to a hostel I planned to stay at. This allowed my diet to be stable and minimized down time hitchhiking into and out of towns where I had no plans of staying. This approach fit my personality / preferences and is clearly not for everyone. 11. In terms of clothes, I had 2 pairs of underwear, 2 pairs of running shorts, 2 short sleeve shirts (fast-drying), 2 pairs of wool socks and a rain jacket. During the cooler months and through the Whites, I also had a down jacket,   Long underwear, a wool hat, and gloves, swopping out a short sleeve shirt for a long sleeve shirt. 12. I began the trip using a Sawyer Squeeze Filter and ended with Aqua-Mira. 3 of my filter bags developed leaks and I was tired of it. I think the larger size filter would have also remedied the problem.13. My medical kit includes prescriptions for poison ivy, giardia, Lyme disease, and a strong topical anti-biotic. I only had to use the anti-biotic but would carry the rest again except perhaps the poison ivy Creme. I also carried a small tube of sun-block and the strongest DEET available on the market. Would carry both again. 14. Mice / chipmunks may be a bigger threat to your food-bag then bears, but you should bring and hang a bear bag. 15. Snoring is a problem both in hostels and shelters. Ear plugs help but distance is probably your greatest weapon if you are a light sleeper.   For that reason, and others, consider tenting over sheltering. 16. Early on in your trip, eat even when you are not hungry. Your body is getting its energy from itself if you are not feeding the fire!17. Invest in a titanium spoon, fork, or spork - you run the risk of breaking with plastic.18. Break big challenges up into small, achievable steps. Sometimes that's just getting to the next blaze, or the tree or rock before the next bend. When you reach it, set your sights on the next small step and repeat. 19. Reward yourself at the end of a big day or a big climb. Lengthen the time between rewards as you get physically stronger and more emotionally resilient. 20. When you slack pack (which I highly recommend doing when feasible), take what you need for bad weather even if it means a little extra weight. 21. How nice the weather is at the bottom of a big mountain has nothing to do with the weather you'll be greeted with when you reach the top!22. If you leave the trail to go the bathroom, make sure you can easily see where you came from. Better to risk ""getting caught in the act"" than not being able to find your way back to the trail. Shxx does in fact happen.  Above all else, know and trust yourself!","camp

NOWA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543002,"Hiker Culture - for anyone reading my posts, War and Peace might have provided a quicker read. This one is what I observed about the hiker culture on the AT.The Cambridge Dictionary defines culture as the way of life of a particular people, esp. as shown in their ordinary behavior and habits, their attitudes toward each other, and their beliefs. Culture ""...developed during the group's history of handling problems ...It determines what is acceptable or unacceptable, important or unimportant, right or wrong, workable or unworkable. (Business Dictionary). One thing that amazed me about the culture on the AT is just how quickly I (and other hikers) adopted it. It became mine and I felt privileged to be part of it. Within days, I recognized what was ""acceptable or unacceptable, important or unimportant, ""right"" or ""wrong"", workable or unworkable."" And it's now easy to see how productive the culture is in handling the types of problems that have emerged for AT hikers and how healthy it is towards having a great hiking experience. Here are 12 of its attributes I saw:1. ""Hike your own Hike."" ""Hike your hike"" means it's your journey - experience it in a way that is respectful of others and of the environment, while enjoying the trail in a way that best suits you and your purpose for hiking. It is a core foundational belief of the community and a great metaphor for life. 2. Inclusive - Everyone is immediately embraced as part of the community. You are ""in"" unless one of two things happen - a) you self select out or b) you exhibit such aberrant behavior as to actually frighten people and they distance themselves from you. 3. Respectful - Regardless of age, sex, race, religion...there is a fundamental level of respect hikers have for each other and the world around them. You see this at ""hiker midnight"" (8:00 pm) in a shelter or hostel bunkhouse when talk suddenly becomes a whisper and then extinguishes altogether, when hikers pass and greet each other on the trail, and when hikers abide each day by the core principles of ""Leave No Trace."" (Leave No Trace refers to a set of outdoor ethics promoting conservation in the outdoors. It is built on seven principles including elements like travel and camp on durable surfaces, dispose of waste properly, leave what you find, and respect wildlife).4. Communal - Besides sharing common interests, attitudes, beliefs, and values, hiker's freely share property and space. Almost every hostel and many (hiker) motels you stay at have a ""hiker box"" where hikers leave or take supplies - food, gear, clothing that one hiker didn't want or need is rapidly consumed by another. Within hostels, complete strangers sleep within feet of each other and congregate to talk in a common living areas; within shelters, the feet that separate strangers who are slumbering together become inches. The motto is that there really are no strangers, just people you haven't met yet! After showering and while doing your laundry in a hostel, you change into ""hiker clothes"" which are typically in a closet or box the hostel owner filled with clothes from a local thrift store. These get laundered after you leave but will get used again and again and again. Oh, and you will often combine your laundry with another hiker(s) to save money, time, and the environment, or pool money in a hostel to share a meal together. 5. Trusting and Trustworthy. Your means of existence resides almost entirely in your backpack - food, clothing, water, gear, and money, and yet you are willing to leave it as you go off trail for water, as you take a sponge (bandanna) bath in a nearby stream, or as you go into a store while the stranger who picked you up waits for you in the parking lot with your pack in their trunk. You will even leave your pack outside of the Barber Shop in Port Clinton PA as you go for a beer down the road at the Firehouse because you've been assured by the Frank and Rocky that ""no one will touch it...trust us. "" And at the EMS Store in Manchester Center VT, you will be asked to leave your pack in the store's vestibule while shopping, but if you want to leave it there rest of the day while eating or shopping elsewhere in town, please do because ""no one will touch it.""6. Simplicity - hikers value the simplicity of their lifestyle. They quickly learn how little they need to survive and be happy. And how seemingly small all of the ""big"" problems they had in their life before hitting the trail now seem to be. The simplicity of trail life is one of its biggest draws. 7. Hikers are comfortable in their own skin, even when it's dirty and smells...which is most of the time. 8 One's socio-economic status is irrelevant on the trail and everyone is treated as equal.  9. Hikers live in the present. One hiker summed it up best when he quoted Seneca verbatim - ""True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he had not.""   10. Honor. Hikers are an honorable lot. They want you to hike your own hike, but if you take a shortcut and don't admit it, there's a good deal of bristling. 11. Optimistic. Hikers do commiserate with one another particularly after a long, hard, wet, cold day, but they are inherently optimistic, and quickly move on from setbacks and struggles. They appreciate that things could have been worse and they know that that matter how bad things get, they will get better.  12. Hard workers - Hiking the entire AT is ultimately more mental than it is physical, but it's really, really physical! AT hikers embrace this aspect of the Trail and repeat it day after day after day. I have no idea whether or not other hikers brought this same work ethic to the jobs they left behind, but when you tap into someone's passion, you see them moving mountains.","Camp

NOWA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543098,"In some ways, what the trail allows one is to see the change they want to be in the world. Here are some things that I saw or experienced on the Appalachian Trail that I hope to integrate into my life moving forward.   Some may resonate with you as well. 1. Capability - No matter what our parents told us, the truth is you can't be anything you want to be (or I would have had a brilliant career in the NBA). That said, we are capable of achieving far more than we think we can. ""What would you do if you knew you could not fail?"" is a question that may help push us beyond belief. 2. Simplicity - Life is very simple on the trail. Your day consists of walking, eating, and sleeping. Your concerns are largely related to meeting your basic physiological needs and staying safe. And what you quickly learn is that you don't need anything else to be happy. What you thought was important off the trail or what kept you up at night isn't even on your radar screen. In this regard, your parents and the Beatles were right, money can't buy you love...or happiness. Simplify your life. 3. Generosity - I was the recipient of countless acts of kindness and generosity I will never forget. A man pulling his car over to give me a ride into town on his way to seeing his wife in a nursing home where she was dying from Alzheimer's. Trail angels who didn't always have a lot of their own resources, unconditionally giving you what they did have. Hostel owners who charged just enough to survive, but whose primary motive was to serve and support you.   Of everything that I experienced on the Trail, becoming more generous may be the hardest for me off the trail, but I couldn't have asked for better role models to begin to stretch myself in this area.    4. Encouragement - I was also the recipient of something I never thought I needed or even wanted and that was words of encouragement. And it made all of the difference in the world. ""You got this""; ""You can do it""; ""You are doing great."" I doubted myself way more than my friends and family did until their words of encouragement became mine. Their encouragement turned into my positive self talk - ""I got this""; ""I'm doing great;""Keep it up...I am going to make it."" As a father, husband, basketball coach, and soon to be school teacher, becoming more encouraging may be the most important lesson I learned on the trail. It may not move mountains, but it does move you up, down, and around them!   5. Goals - The power of small goals in achieving great ones. Even though I was in relatively good shape at the start of my hike, there were times during the first several weeks where I was doubled over, gasping for air, wondering how I was going to do this everyday. What I soon found was that by breaking up the 2,000 mile trip in small achievable goals was the only way to go. A week was broken into days; a day was broken into hours; a long ascent up a mountain was shortened by just telling myself I needed to get to the next blaze, and once there, the blaze after that. If the blazes were too far apart, I'd pick out a specific tree or rock and tell myself I would rest there, only to pick out the next one after that and repeat. Sometime I would count silently in my head, ""I just need to get to 100."" And again, once there, ""now 200."" 5. Rewards - Linked to number 5 above (the power of small goals), rewards help fuel the fire to meet the next challenge. Sometimes these rewards are given by the trail, like a magnificent view after a long, hard climb, or icy-cold spring water on a hot, humid day. But often these rewards are self-given, like a piece of candy after walking for hours in a row, a short nap in the middle of the afternoon, or a reservation at the next hostel where a shower, clean clothes, and good food awaits. Not every big challenge needs to be met with a reward, but every reward seems to help get you ready for the next big challenge.6. Resilience -The ability to bend but not break, to recover from misfortune, and to adjust to unforeseen circumstances is a critical success factor for through hikers. If there is a formula for it, it might be (Optimism + Gratitude + Purpose = Resilience). I saw a hiking community that believed no matter how bad things were, they were going to get better; that was grateful for what they had, even when it wasn't a lot ; and that had a sense of purpose for being on the trail. This combination of attributes seems to carry hikers a long way - as far as Georgia. May the sun bring you new energy by day, may the moon softly restore you by night, may the rain wash away your worries, may the breeze blow new strength into your being, may you walk gently through the world and know it's beauty all the days of your life.
