Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480365,"I guess it's about time to put this out on the World Wide Web to make it ""internet official""...I'm going to attempt a thru hike of the Appalachian Trail!I've set a fairly arbitrary start date of March 7, 2016, and I'll finish when I'm done. 413 days might seem like an awful lot of time, but golly it's coming fast! There will be more technical posts in the future, but this will serve as a basic introduction to my hike.I think the big question that most aspiring thru hikers get is ""Why?"" I think this is also the most hated question from a hiker's perspective. There's no simple answer. If you get it, you get it. If you don't, you probably never will. There are a lot of responses that might be true: self discovery, personal challenge, a love of the outdoors, a disdain for society, transition, general dissatisfaction with one's current situation, etc. Some of these apply to me, some do not. But the answer to this overly simplified question is not in this list. The answer, for me at least, is that it's just meant to be.I am fortunate to have a whole heap of support. My family and friends are behind me 100%. Even those who do not understand it still have my back and respect what I am doing.I've made a lot of gear decisions recently, and I have a few more to make. The biggest hurdle for me right now is getting my daily life in order, or rather doing away with my daily life. I hope to liquidate most of my material life over the next year and that will be quite an undertaking. One thing that I am kicking off right now that I'm super excited about is making this hike about more than just myself. Don't get me wrong, I'm hiking the trail for myself, but I want to do some good while I'm at it. I am collecting per-mile pledges for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Pledges are accepted through HikeFor. The page for my hike is http://www.hikefor.com/Spice/AT/2016. The way it works is you make a per-mile pledge through the site, HikeFor tracks my progress, and when I complete my hike they will send you a reminder about the pledged donation to be sent to St. Jude's. The money does not go through me or through HikeFor, 100% of it goes to the cause. So go have a look and make a pledge if you can, even a penny a mile is awesome! I'm totally stoked!",,413 Days!,"Jan 19, Mon",0

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524288,"So... It's been a while. It's been AGES since I've updated, and there are a number of reasons for that. The main reason is that everything has kind of been up in the air for a while. I never planned to not do the trail in 2016, but I lost a lot of the finalized plans I had made... A lot has changed in my planning since my last update. One of the big changes is obvious, since I am not writing this post from the trail... I had to scrape my 3/7/16 start date.On September 1st, while playing rugby, I blew out my left knee. Tore my ACL, MCL, and meniscus. On October 1st I had surgery to reconstruct the ACL and repair the meniscus, followed by six weeks on crutches, fully non-weight bearing. I will be medically cleared to hike the trail in July.I'm not waiting until July! I can't do anything with a July start date! I don't want to start my thru hike off with the 100 Mile Wilderness, and a SOBO hike would be about my only option starting in July (and that would still be a late start I think). Much to my surgeon's chagrin, I am planning to start my flip flop in mid May. I haven't really hammered out the deets yet. Perhaps I'll end up going for a Cool Breeze. Starting in Harper's Ferry NOBO doesn't give me a whole lot of time on the trail before I hit the infamous rock scrambles of PA. I'd like to have a little more trail experience and be a bit closer to my medical clear date before I find myself there, but we'll see what happens!I am getting rid of all of my stuff, today I gave my property manager my notice to vacate at the end of April, and I'll give my two weeks notice at work next Friday. I am giving my notice at work on April Fool's day, but this is no joke!I'm not nearly as ready as I had hoped to be. I'm not nearly as ready as I was this time last year. Damn knees. Well, at least I have a matching set now! I'm nervous, scared, and out of my mind excited!! I can't wait to ditch my material life and set out on this adventure. I refuse to let a good, comfortable job and a good, comfortable life get between me and my dreams!",,Long Overdue Update,"Mar 21, Mon",0
Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525154,"Alright! I registered my thru hike with the ATC this morning! I have set a start date of 5/16 from Harper's Ferry. I'm still not certain how all of that is going to shake out, but it seemed like a good option. Trail Days is 5/13-5/15, so I figure if I decide to go, I should be able to find a hitch up to HF fairly easily!",,Making It ATC Official,"Mar 28, Mon",0
Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528539,"Well, this is day three of unemployment, and I think it suits me nicely! Everyone has been assuming that I am just going to be hanging out for a month before I start my hike, and how I wish that was true! I have to be out of my house by the end of next week, and I have put off everything until I could work full time on it. Now I am facing a looming deadline with the house and trying to work out how I am going to get it all done! I am meant to be heading to Louisiana on Thursday for the weekend, but I don't know if I am going to get enough done to be able to do that. But enough about that...I was in ATL Saturday for the Columbia Bombshells vs. Atlanta Harlequins Rugby match, and I found out one of the Atlanta players is starting her SOBO (Southbound) thru hike in June! I spent a little time talking with her about it, and I look forward to passing her on the trail. The world just keeps getting smaller and smaller!It hits me sometimes that I will be living out of my pack on the trail a month from now, and I get completely giddy!",,Unemployed But Oh So Busy!,"Apr 18, Mon",0
Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534878,"Whelp, some folks have informed me that they have noticed my lack of diligence with updating my journal, and for anyone still expecting a May 16th start that might have been a little disappointing. But, rest assured, I have not abandoned this journal! Some things came up, and I am really glad that I had this flexibility available in my schedule to be able to take care of things the way I wanted to.So, new start date, May 27th! Just a couple of days away! We will be heading up to Harper's Ferry on Thursday, and I plan to hit the trail Friday! Yes!!I am super apprehensive about my knee, but I am going to get out there with plans to take things nice and easy, and I mean really take my time, for the first several weeks. I'll do what I can for as long as I can. I am not afraid of taking a little risk with this (obviously), but if I get to a point where I feel like the risks is too great, I will reassess.I have been living with limited material resources for the last few week, and it's been going great. I am looking forward to letting go of even more of that! My pack is loaded. I met up with my sister, Sarah, yesterday at Walmart to shop for the first few days on the trail and discuss/explore menu options as she will be my primary source of mail drops. I have taken the obligatory gear pics and food pics. I'm not really sure right now what my pack weighs, though I will find out before I hit the trail. It's around 30 lbs though, far from light, but not a terrible weight. I expect that to drop a bit as I get my routine figured out, send home things I won't be using, and learn to be more efficient with my food choices and mileage planning.

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535036,"Anticipation is building! We leave in the morning for West Virginia, I hit the trail the next day.Today was pretty chill. Went through my pack again, and I have been trying to workout my desired distribution for guide book pages. I'm thinking I will get my next installment of pages at Delaware Water Gap. These stops that I select will be my first real commitment to any type of mail drop, so naturally I am selecting them by finding the towns in which the trail goes by the post office!Was able to get in some quality time with some good folks, as well as squeeze in quick visits with equally amazing people! Spent some time working on lingering logistics, and I have a couple of things to work through tomorrow.Looking forward to a beautiful drive!",,Last Night in Columbia,"May 25, Wed",0
Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535201,"Well, I have found a most excellent road trip partner in Piper. Somehow our 7.5 hour trip turned into a 12.5 hour epic journey! Too much ADHD in the car might have contributed.We had some initial struggles with the rental car, but we got that worked out easily enough and we have very much enjoyed The Silver Bullet. We aren't really sure what happened or where the time went. But, our side trip through Shenendoah National Park and our late night stop off at Dinosaurland were totally with it! We could have done without the traffic though. We are settled into a motel in Charles Town, WV, very near Harpers Ferry. Tomorrow we will hit the post office, stop by the ATC, then the journey begins. Pips will hike out with me a little ways then leave me on my own. Several times throughout the day I've looked over at Piper with a goofy grin exclaiming ""Holy shit! I can't believe I'm actually doing this!"" It is sure to an amazing adventure, whatever happens!",,Road Trip to Harpers Ferry!,"May 27, Fri",0
Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535320,"So... Day 1!As with most backpacking trips I spent a fair part of the day trying to remember why this is supposed to be fun. But, as always happens, the struggles are quickly wiped from my memory! After checking out of the hotel Piper and I made the planned stops at the Post Office in Harpers Ferry and the ATC. I bought my AT Passport, and as a registered hiker with a passport, I got a free Flip-Flopper pin! Check it out in my photos.We then set off for the trail down a .2 mile blue blaze (side trail) from the ATC. The first .3 miles was fairly rocky with uneven, steep steps here and there, and I was a little shaky on my knees, but that settled down pretty quickly. Piper hiked with me for a few miles alone a (flat) section of the Patomic River. She then promptly ditched my to drive back to Columbia just in time to miss the climb! That climb was quite the struggle! 1000 feet in two miles with some very steep sections. But I took my sweet time and made it through. Then the trail continued to undulate for s couple more miles to the shelter. I haven't taken any pics in camp, but I'm at the Ed Garvey shelter tonight, though I decided to set up the hammock. Do a google image search for the Ed Garvey shelter, it's one of the nicer ones on the trail. Fairly crowded here with it being Memorial Day weekend. The shelter is bit full but there are a good number of tents and a couple of hammocks.The spring here isn't my favorite thing in the world. It's just a trickle spring, and it's a half mile hike down a very steep slope with several switch backs. I probably drank a liter hiking back up!! But I was nearly out, and that was after a day hiker gave me about 15 oz. I brought four liters initially, but it was a hot day, and I drink a lot of water, especially trekking uphill! Used a liter for dinner and to drink through the night, I should have at least another three liters. It's hard to estimate with the camelback reservoir without digging that our of my pack. I'll hit a campground three or four miles in and will top off, the water source at the next shelter is unreliable.It's supposed to rain tonight. Hopefully all of my gear is sufficiently protected under my rain fly!Bedtime.","Harpers Ferry
",Ed Garvey Shelter,"May 27, Fri",6.30
Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535493,"A nice, easy, short day today. I took my time getting out of camp this morning. The hike was really nice. I would have pushed on to the next shelter if I had more flexibility, but in Maryland you can only camp at designated spots. I didn't want to push things too early and be pressured by having to get to a shelter.Blisters are definitely a thing. They were a thing yesterday too. But, they are very tolorable. Though lancing the one that was under a callous on the back of my heel hurt like a bitch! I've already figured out which toenail will be the first to go, but again, it's tolorable. I am not yet able to eat all of the food I prep for dinner (e.g., pack of Lipton noodles or rice at mashed potatoes), not to I particularly want to. Unfortunately whatever I don't eat must be buried or packed out. I think I'll start just making half tomorrow.Spent about a hour and a half at Gapland park (where I was pleased to find running water and trash cans!) and arrived at Crampton Gap around 2. Had a leisurely afternoon of reading as the various available campsites and other semi flat areas filled up with hikers. Being Memorial Day weekend we get not only the usual weekenders, but the holidayers as well. One young (early 20s) guy, Bashful, who is camping very near me with his wife and friends is here for a bit of adventure before starting chemo next Wednesday. Bashful and his crew started a campfire tonight that drew in several people. Met Butter Foot who is here hiking with his mom, Addie, and will be starting his southbound thru in July, so I will run into him again up the trail.","Ed Garvey Shelter
",Crampton Gap Shelter,"May 28, Sat",4.20
Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535608,"Good day today. I spent some time in camp this morning hanging out with the crew from last night. Hiked with them for a show ways, but they were pushing a long day to get to Pibe Knob shelter tonight, and when I felt myself going faster than I should over the rocks I backed off and let them go. Parts of the trail were very rocky today, and my feet are definitely sore, but all in all it was a good hike. I ran into a family of five that have been doing day hikes on the trail for a while. They will finish the Maryland section tomorrow. It's great to see how many families are getting their kids out here. They gave me an awesome sandwich with cucumbers and I'm pretty sure I will continue to crave cucumbers throughout this trip. The various food thoughts and cravings kicked in today. The hunger hasn't set in yet, but the limited menu certainly has!I'm hanging in the Dahlgren backpacking campsite. It's closer to the road than I would generally be comfortable with, but there are nine people here that I have gotten to know, plus a couple others, so I feel pretty safe. It's a great campground with tent pads, a bear pole, and bathroom facilities with soap and hot showers!!I ran into a brother-sister duo the last couple of miles who are finishing up a few days on the trail tomorrow. Turns out they had a dinner reservation at the South Mountain Inn just about a quarter mile up the trail. So naturally, I crashed the party! Actually they were happy for the company, and a couple of older gentlemen hiking together (who I have been at every campsite with but had not spoken to until today) honed us as well. We were slightly concerned about our attire, as this was quite the fancy place, but they are used to hikers. For a little over $50 I got an amazing duck something or another with all the fixings, lobster bisque that was to die for, a refreshing Moscow mule, and a coke. We had a good time relaxing for a couple of hours, sampling each other's meals, and enjoying pleasant company.It's weird, I keep thinks by ""I'll need to remember this for when I do my thru hike"". Then I remember that I am doing it RIGHT NOW! So surreal. I am going to bed with aching feet and sore muscles, but I'm relatively clean, my clothes (freshly washed in the shower) are drying on the ridgeline above my head, I'm thoroughly stuffed, and the pitter patter of raindrops on my fly is a beautiful sound to fall asleep to.","Crampton Gap Shelter
",Dahlgren Backpacking Campground,"May 29, Sun",6.70
Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535779,"Good day. Some tough climbs, but all is well and the view this evening was totally worth it. We saw the Washington Monument, and that was pretty damn cool. It was a good day of hiking. Ran into Ed and Lyle (the two gentlemen that joined us for dinner last night) a lot today. So far I have been at every campsite with them, but yesterday was the first time we spoke. We all went out onto the rocks together, then had dinner, then went back out to the rocks for sunset. We spent some time hanging out with Robin, the caretaker/ridge runner stationed here, trail name Miss America. Blisters still exist, but I'm still mostly ignoring them. Ibuprofen is a Godsend! New thing today though... Both of my big toe tips are numb... Probs not good. The textbook answer is probably that my boots are too small, but I bought the largest size I could comfortably walk in. We'll see what the next couple of days bring.Lounging in my hang for the night, not far from falling asleep. I think I'll go back out to the rocks in a couple hours to view the stars and the distant city lights, if it's clear enough anyway. I think the idea of a thru hike is finally starting to sink in. This is amazing!I've got nowhere to be and all day to get there.","Dahlgren Backpacking Campground
",Annapolis Rocks Campground,"May 30, Mon",7.40
Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535988,"Time moves weird out here. This morning was soooo long ago, but the day kinda flew by. Doesn't quite make sense. I would have no idea what the events of the day where and in what order were in not for the pictures I have taken. (Keep in mind, one pic is displayed in each post, but others are available via the photos link on the left.)I woke up at 7 this morning. Well, got out of the hammock at 7. Took my time making breakfast and breaking camp. Cute little spring at Annapolis Rocks, and I swung by the rocks on my way back to camp. (Because I ended up on the wrong trail but it's all one big loop. Explains why Ed made the loop last night after his trip to the spring, which he confirmed.)When I was finally ready to head out at 830 and was getting on my way I ran into Robin. I stopped by her tent and she made us coffee. It ended up being well after 10 but the time I got out of there, but that's okay...it was good company, decent coffee, and I left with a bag of Doritos which I had been craving. Not long after setting off I took a blue blaze (side trail) to Black Rock. This was the most amazing vista. I climbed out onto the rocks where I met Trooper, a chick from Scotland who is they hiking. For some reason I want to say that it overlooked the Cumberland valley. It was hazy, as it has been since I started, but really beautiful.The rest of the day kinda passed in a blur. There were some ups and downs, but the trail mostly just stayed along the ridgeline. I am getting into rockier terrain. There was one long scramble that was blazeless as far as I could tell, but I kept going and eventually saw that swatch of white that confirmed I was still on the trail. Phew! A rock scramble, by the way, is a field of rocks that are too small and condensed to stroll around, but too large to breeze over. It's pretty technical as each step must be calculated, searching out the safest path from rock to rock, keeping in my the potential for slippage and rock shifts. It takes a lot of energy both mentally and physically. Unfortunately this type of terrain leaves little opportunity for looking up!The rock scramble was followed by a very short, very steep climb, then a long, very steep decent. But, I made it in to Ensign Cowell without incident and net up with Ed and Lyle. There are a few other thru hikers here as well as one guy who, I think, just hangs out on the trail. He's a great source of info as he knows the trail and be area very well. But the man won't shut up! Nice guy though. The shelter is .2 miles from the road and a parking lot is not far from there. A number of people hitched into town today for resumption and/or treats. One guy packed in several beers which he shared around, though I declined. A thru hiking couple ordered pizzas and salads to be delivered to the parting lot. I was strongly considering doing the same, but I couldn't really be bothered. I had pretty much decided that I was just going to have Robin's Doritos for dinner. But there ended up being more pizza than they could handle and they shared a slice with each of the hikers that were around at the time. That sufficed for my dinner!I really need to figure out that I am going to eat out here. Oatmeal for breakfast is awesome, especially with my coffe/hot chocolate combo I had this morning! Lunch so far has been tuna on English muffins. So much better with Doritos! I can keep going similar to that for now. But dinner...I am not going to be able to eat mashed potatoes. A spoon or two of the flakes as a side dish might be decent, but not as a whole meal. Honestly I am not sure if I want to continue bothering to cook for dinner. Though last night I made a Bear Creek minestrone soup a weekender had left behind in a previous shelter, and it was amazing. Still have half of that left to cook for dinner tomorrow. I am going to have to explore my options when I get into Waynesboro the day after tomorrow.Yay! Town day in two days! We will have a very short day tomorrow, but it's supposed to be really rocky so that's good, then a town day the next! We will still have a few miles to hike, then I will hitchhike into town with Ed and Lyle. A hotel, a nice shower, a laundry mat, hopefully an amazing burger! Yes!!Well, long day and the kids are heavy. Good night!","Annapolis Rocks Campground

I feel like I am starting to get my trail legs. I'm enjoying the daily hikes and I don't dread the steep climbs or descents. I just take my time and break when I need to which is less and less. Had a real doosey of a climb today, but it was good. Took a blue blaze out to Raven Rock which was an amazing view. Even had to FaceTime with my bro to rub it in a little! ??I think we have about ten or so people here at the shelter tonight with three sleeping in the shelter itself.

",Raven Rock Shelter,"Jun 01, Wed",4.80
Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536274,"Howdy all! I'm coming to you this evening from a laundromat in Waynesboro, PA! Actually ran into Bombadil and Goldberry here. They are over in the corner blogging and reading newspapers or something. Started the day at my usual leisurely pace in camp. Was a nice hike out of Raven Rock shelter for a couple of miles, then Ed and Lyle caught up with me at High Rock Ledges. What a beautiful place. It's been graffitied pretty good, but that kind of adds to the character. (By NO means do I condone spray painting our natural resources!) I did appreciate the ""Bernie Sanders 2016 F*ck Trump tag though.   The view here was amazing. This is an official take off platform (?) for hang gliders. I could just imagine running and leaping of the edge with the valley below you! What a rush that must be! After piddling about on the ledge for a few minutes it started misting a little. We knew we had some touch scrambling ahead of us, and no desire to do so on slippery rocks, so we made our way on. Wow. Just wow.The decent that followed was pretty nasty. Very steep, very rocky. I don't think I even stopped to get any pics of it. I suppose this was good practice for PA (aka, Rocksylvania). A couple of times I used my hands to lower myself down rather than my trekking poles, and at one point I even plopped down on my butt and scooted down the rock! I've decided that the key to dealing with that type of terrain is to go slow, not be too proud to butt slide, and take breaks if you start to fatigue. After that decent there were some scrambles to contend with, but they weren't too bad, then it was smooth sailing into Pen Mar State Park. I decided to drop my pack and continue on to the state line another quarter mile down. I know it might be silly, but we were able to catch a ride into Waynesboro, and I wanted my first time in Pennsylvania to be by foot. So, I hit the state line, hit the Mason Dixion line, then headed back to the park to catch a ride.We were shuttled to the hotel by a guy who has been driving hikers around for decades. He was very loquacious, and the ride came with an unsolicited tour of the town and historical discussion. Once checked in I parted ways with the guys to get cleaned up. Then dressed in our least stinky clothes, we headed out on foot in search of lunch. I finally got my cheeseburger and fries! A Waynesburger to be precise! Definitely hit the spot. Resupply at Dollar General, then back to the hotel. I volunteered to do laundry. No sense in the three of us sitting around a laundromat waiting for what barely amounted to a full load in total. Since starting this post the laundry has been completed and I have made it back to the hotel. Goldberry had half a bottle of permethrin (hardcore bug/tick repellent for fabrics) left over with she dropped off for me, so now my hiking clothes have been treated and are drying. I treated my hammock and sleeping bag before the trip, so I didn't bother with my sleep clothes. I'll get back together with Ed and Lyle in an hour or two for dinner, and that pretty much brings you up to right now. :-)I am planning to start upping my mileage a bit. I am not a terribly fast hiker, and I don't want to push that and hurt myself, so I will likely be doing earlier starts and later days. Stealth camping (camping somewhere other than a designated shelter or campground) is more accepted in PA that's in MD where it isn't allowed at all, so I will have more flexibility with my timing. Should see some longer days in this next leg, if the rocks allow at least!I'd like to dedicate this post to Laura Wilkerson who has apparently been anxiously waiting for an update. :-)","Raven Rock Shelter

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536471,"So a lot of things came into play this morning that interfered with my plans to hit the trail this afternoon... Nothing big, just a bunch of little things...Last night Ed and Lyle decided to spend another night in town. Last night I also lost a toenail and realized that one of my blisters was trying really hard to get infected. I woke up this morning and started packing my gear. But I was so clean. And the bed was so soft. And the weather was supposed to be crummy. And I wanted my toe to heal a little. And Ed and Lyle were staying. I decided to pack up, have some breakfast, and see how I felt. After breakfast I went to the hotel office and extended my stay another night. So there you have it, my first zero day (a zero mileage day, usually taken in town, but also an option at a shelter). It's really too early for a zero, but I'm okay with it. And I'm pleased to say that I'm ready to get back on the trail!Not much was accomplished today, though I did find a new shirt on sale at a little shop down the way. I don't know what I was thinking when I threw a WHITE shirt into my pack for a thru hike! I've been cleaning and organizing my gear, reading, and walking about town. We have a shuttle picking us up at 830 tomorrow morning to take us back to Pen Mar where the adventures will continue! I'll have to take special care to keep my feet clean and my wee injuries infection free. Will need to find an Outfitter soon I guess for a new pair of shoes. On top of the missing toenail, both of my big toes are still numb after a day of rest. Nothing too painful, but I want to head off any future problems and make my feet as happy as I can. I'm asking an awful lot of them after all!","Days Inn - Waynesboro, PA

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536626,"This morning after breakfast at the hotel we caught our prearranged shuttle back to Pen Mar to continue our hike. It started off with a nice climb, and I gotta say, my knee felt a little shaky. But, as with Day 1, after a mile or two it was back to feeling strong. It was a nice hike today. I laced my boots a little differently and all my toes are feeling good! We ran into some trail maintainers this morning and they warned us about the approaching squall line that is meant to hit tomorrow afternoon. I has read an article about the expectations of this ""dangerous, long-lived"" storm over breakfast. Apparently we took our zero day too soon! The folks we ran into suggested we find a shelter this evening and hunker down tomorrow to wait it out. If we are going to be stuck in a shelter all day, we want it to be a nice one, so we made good time getting to Tumbling Run, passing two other shelters in the way. This place is pretty nice. There's a snoring shelter and a non-snoring shelter. Picnic tables, fire pits, clothes lines, and a pavilion! Pretty awesome as far a shelters go! And the privy is fabulous. It's stocked with TP and hand sanitizer, and has a doorbell and a light switch (both non-functioning).We got here about three, and while I did put my hammock up for a while by the creek to lounge, with the potential for bad weather, I decided to spend my first night in a shelter. The evening has been spent hanging out. Ed tried the hammock and fell in love with it. I introduced Ed to the wonders of SnapChat. He got his first smart phone a month or so ago so ice been helping him get acquainted with it. Lyle and I played a few rounds of Rummy with a coupe of thru hikers staying here, Sway and Mr. Wizard. And now everyone is settled in for the night. Well as settled as can be given that Sway and I just shared an unexplainable giggle fit in the middle of the shelter while she was blowing up her sleeping pad. I'm not sure what was happening, but whatever it was it was hilarious apparently.The weather that was supposed to show up this afternoon never hit, and I will play it by ear tomorrow as to whether to stay here or move on. But, unless the weather turns some hiking is probably in the cards!It's pretty beautiful as I lie here looking out of the shelter. You sleep with your feet to the back of the shelter, your head by the entrance. This decreases the risk of mice running over your face as you sleep. Better they run over your feet! There's a nice flow coming from the sky outlining the trees. Actually I can't see it right this moment as my head and my phone are buried beneath my fleece so as not to disturb anyone with the light from my screen. I am ready to enjoy the night, hoping to get some rain to appreciate from the dry shelter as I snooze!Nowhere to go, all day to get there.","Pen Mar State Park - Waynesboro, PA

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536727,"We decided to heed the advice given us yesterday and took a zero at the shelter. We waited all day for the rain to show, and when it finally did, several hours late, the storm was underwhelming.So it's been a day of hanging around and reading. I had the hammock up until the rain hit, so that was nice. I'm inclined to say that we are better of being in a ""we should have hiked"" situation than a ""we shouldn't have hiked"" situation, but I'm also not one to sit around and wait out storms. I don't know that I would make this call again unless the storm is a bit more imminent.On a brighter note, I think I might be setting a record! For the slowest start on a thru hike! Ah well, as I keep saying we aren't out here to get to Maine (or wherever); if that were the case it would be easier to drive! We are here to be on the trail! No where to be and all day to get there!","Tumbling Run Shelters

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537039,"I left the shelter at about 830 this morning. Ed and Lyle took a blue blaze trail for an easier route to Chimney Rock while I started my day with a 900 ft climb. That little stretch was gorgeous! It was steep, but not too rocky. It was cool with a nice breeze and there was mountain laurel everywhere! It was one of those times when I take a deep breath and say to myself, ""yes! This is why I am out here!"" The guys were on the trail side taking a break when I finished the climb. Ed had said there wasn't much to see without a bunch of rock climbing, but I learned my lesson when I bypassed Waverly Cliffs on day one and missed an awesome view of the Patomic. I left my pack and took the blue blaze trail up to Chimney Rock. The rock climbing wasn't all that treacherous, and the view was amazing! It was a great opportunity to FaceTime my brother David to rub it in a little. ;-) I also FaceTimed my granny to see how she was recovering from her first chemo treatment last week. She was all smiles!Continuing on the trail got rockier. Man, that is hard in the feet! But the blisters and missing toenail have all resolved themselves so I'm very grateful for that! We had some pretty good rock scrambles today. The kind where you're not quite sure where the trail is so you just climb to the top of the rock pile and search for a white blaze. We played leap frog throughout the day with a young man called Kritter who stayed at Tumbling Run with us last night. Sounds like when this guy isn't hiking he is hoping freight trains from one place to the next. He is walking up to Vermont for a Rainbow Gathering. When we made it to Route 30 we called the hostel and they sent a driver to come pick us up. The hostel is only about .8 miles from the trail, but those miles don't count and road walking can be a crummy business. The shuttle kept us from having to hitch. When we got to the hostel they showed us around, then we got showers and I went to the community center next door to see if I could help with dinner. Queen Diva and Sherlock were preparing our meal and they put me to work, but I didn't really do much. It was just the two of them and the three of us. We had fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, apple sauce, watermelon, and a brownie/frosting/chocolate ice cream Mississippi mud dessert. Halfway through dinner a thru hike, Jesse, showed up. He grabbed a plate and tucked in. He starts at springer on April 10, so he's making pretty good time. After dinner, Queen Diva took us to Dollar General and Walmart to resupply. We had stocked up for about five days while in Waynesboro, so we really didn't need much. I picked up some pop tarts to sublime the my breakfasts (apparently dollar general boxes only have three packs in them). We were also told that there were loads of eggs that we were welcome to, so we picked up some bread and bacon for breakfast tomorrow. We are all settled in for the night. We have beds to throw our sleeping bags on and pillows. We are clean, well fed (and we didn't even have to clean out any pots after dinner) and generally feeling pretty good. Today wasn't bad, and a top mileage day so far. We have a 10 mile hike planned for tomorrow. Queen Diva will take us back to the trail at 8am. I forget what the hike tomorrow looks like. I think there are a couple of climbs and maybe a section or two that looks like they could hold some rock scrambles. The elevation profile gives you a good idea of how strenuous a day it will be, but I wish they had some kind of ranking for how rocky it will be. Or how muddy, or whatever else might slow you down and/or exhaust you early. I was definitely ready to be finished with the hike today!I had originally thought that I would skip the hostel and go on the the next shelter, 2.4 miles up I think. But I wanted to get my phone and external charger juiced up. The phone got a lot of use lounging around the shelter yesterday. So I thought maybe I would just camp outside the hostel for $12. But then a bed was only $10 more and I decided that would be worth not having to set up and break down camp. I'm glad I went with the bed. Being in a dorm can make a hostel lose its value sometimes, but I am in a room with two single beds, and I'm the only one in here. Ed and Lyle are in another two person room, and Jesse is sleeping along in a room with two sets of bunk beds. A good nights sleep will serve me well. The highway is buzzing by, a few feet from the building, but I think I'll be able to sleep through it pretty well.'I discovered today that I can live stream through Facebook. I did a couple of test streams, then after dinner and errands I set up another stream. I had 20 people login throughout. It was pretty darn cool to interact with everyone that way. I will continue rondo these live streams. I will try to plan better so I can actually schedule them and let everyone on Facebook know, though apparently you get a push notification when I start one. So if you are interested in seeing these live streams, make sure we are Facebook friends. Let me know who you are and why you are friend requesting me because if I don't know you I will not accept your friend invite.I continue to be astounded my how many people are reading this journal.

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537217,"Started this morning as I start most morning... Packing up Peri. Peri, that's my pack. It's short for Peripeteia, usually used as a literary term meaning a reversal of circumstances or turning point. Anyway, packed up Peri and took all of my gear downstairs. We bought some bacon and bread last night to go with the eggs available at the hostel, and Ed got crackin on breakfast. While he was working on that, I was outside talking with Junker, who runs the hostel, and he suggested slack packing. Slack packing is basically when you store your pack somewhere and hike a section of the trail using only a daypack. Sounded like a great idea to me! I made that decision, then Ed and Lyle decided to slack as well. So, after a leisurely breakfast and after transferring the essentials (ID, water, snacks, map) into a daypack borrowed from the hostel, we set out in the shuttle for the trail.Junker dropped us off at Shippensburg Rd. There in the parking lot by the trail a couple was set up doing trail magic. They had sodas and fruit and we're cooking burgers and whatnot. Figures! My first good trail magic and I had just stuffed myself with a great breakfast! Ah well, we sent many hikers their way throughout the day. From Shippensburg Rd we hiked 11.4 miles back to Route 30 where we ended our hike yesterday. It was another beautiful day.   A thunderstorm came through midday. It didn't last very long, and the rain wasn't too heavy. Passing a thru hiker in the middle of the storm I offered up my general ""how's it going?"" I really enjoyed his response... ""Even when it hails on the Appalachian Trail it's still a beautiful day!"" And he is so right! So yes, we got a bit of hail, but it was a bit smaller than pea size and was short lived. It's neat watching it bounce all over the trail though!Much of the trail went through pine groves, so the trail was a nice soft bed of pine needles for a good bit. And there were some nice long flat stretches. At least they felt flat. Maybe a slight down hill. Had a couple of steep climbs, but they were short, and had a couple of really steep descents. Really steep, especially hiking into Caledonia State Park. I was glad to be hiking packless (more or less) and to be hiking southbound. Though in it necessarily sure that I prefer downhill to uphill. I might be taking a lot of breaks and sucking wind on the uphills, but those downhills are hard on the feet and can be pretty technical with a bad knee (or two). I passed a couple of shelters, including the amazing Quarry Gap Shelter. This thing was complete with tenting platforms, a swing, multiple picnic tables, a sun dial, even hanging flower baskets! I'm sure if I had checked out the privy there would have been TP and hand sanitizer! Seriously, check out the photos I posted of it. Once in Caledonia SP I set off down the road in search of the park office to get my AT passport stamped, effectively adding a mile to my hike!! But I got my stamp, the first since Harper's Ferry. From the park it was just a half mile to where we were meeting the shuttle.As we were waiting for the shuttle a couple of hikers came out of the woods across the street and started walking down the highway. I hollered at them and turned out they were going to the hostel, so we were able to hook them up with a ride. Beats walking down the road for a mile. It's a big joke that hikers, thru hikers in particular, will walk for miles and miles in the woods but will hitch a ride across a parking lot. But man, when you hike all day another mile or two is still a big deal! Especially on hot blacktop! Especially when those miles ""don't count""!Anyway, back at the hostel we all got cleaned up and Queen Diva sent me to the store to pick up butter for dinner. We had leftovers from last night, plus her awesome homemade mac and cheese! It was fabulous. After dinner we went to the ice cream shop where I conducted my live Facebook video thingy. Had about 40 people login. I was slow with the ice cream and coffee, so they left me. QD took the new hikers (Andrew and his mom whom I've taken to calling Magma because apparently she's slow moving with bursts of energy) back to the hostel. She picked up Ed and Lyle and came back for me about a half hour later and we made a trip to the ATM. And that pretty much rounds out the day. Fun story... Andrew and Magma stayed at Tumbling Run last night, the shelter that I spent two nights at. Andrew, who was hammock camping, woke up in the middle of the night to a bear sniffing his head. Apparently this thing nose bumped the back of his head a few times while poking around looking for tasty morsels! Yikes! I'm not scared of bears, but that would have shaken me up pretty good! He said it was pretty petrifying and it took him an hour to get back to sleep. Ha! I would have hightailed it into the shelter!! Geez!","Shippensburg Rd

After dropping us off he headed up to Pine Furnace State Park to drop off our bags, so we got to slack pack again!!It was a beautiful hike. Very easy walking today, mostly flat or a super gentle downhill all day with very few climbs and even those were almost negligible. We did get clobbered by a rain storm pretty early, but I just threw in my rain gear and kept trucking! Man it was windy today! It only rained for maybe half an hour, but I kept my rain jacket on for the warmth. Passed the midway point today! (Though not for me, of course.)I got into Pine Grove Furnace about 30-45 minutes before Ed and Lyle. After collecting my pack from the general store, I hung out for a bit with another flip flopper, Serena, while we both enjoyed the ""Best burgers on the AT"". Joe joined us shortly after we sat down, he is a LASHer (long add section hiker) who is doing the northern half of the trail. We had a few hours before the hostel was to open, so we enjoyed getting to know each other a bit. Moon Boots (thru hiker) showed up and took on the Half Gallon Challenge. A challenge to eat a half gallon of ice cream. He competed it in about 43 minutes. While that was going on Lyle and Ed showed up. Serena decided to push on, and we continued to wait until we could check in to the hostel. We went to the AT museum to kill some time, and eventually we headed over to the Ironmasters Mansion which is not a hostel. This is a great building with a lot of history. There is a trap door in a closet under the stairwell that served as access to the Underground Railroad. Very cool, check out the pics. We got settled into the hostel, the men's dorm on the first floor, the women's on the second. I'm the only chick here so ice got the dorm with about 8 or 9 sets of bunk beds to myself! After we got settled in, Joe, Ed, Lyke, and I headed back to the general store (right next door) so that I could participate in the half gallon challenge myself. I've pretty much always said that I wouldn't do the challenge, because how can that be a good idea. But, I guess I just got caught up! Man it was cold!! Not just the ice cream, but the weather. At some points I was shaking so bad I could barely get the spoon in my mouth! But I rose to the challenge and finished in about 47 minutes. I still feel very full, and while my teeth didn't start hurting until about a half hour after I was finished, they continued to hurt for a couple of days. It was all worth it though as I got a special teeny, wooden ice cream spoon.Back in the hostel for the night and looking forward to sleep. Dressed in long johns but still cold, looking forward to a warm bed.    Very much looking forward to proper sheets since the last hostel was our sleeping bags on the mattresses. Interesting thing... The proprietor of the hostel said that there were hikers in in the last week who were talking about me. I didn't recognize any names in the log book, but not everyone signs those.

After two nights in Waynesboro, two at Tumbling Run inside the shelter, Ateo are Trail of Hope Hostel, and one at the Ironmasters Mansion, I'm happy to be back in my hang!!Breakfast this morning at the mansion was waffles and bagels. I woke up pretty hungry at about 530 having skipped dinner last night in favor of the half gallon challenge. After food, packing, and saying my goodbyes to the innkeepers, I headed over to the general store to meet Dan and Jessie (grad school friends), who were coming out to hike with me a bit. When they arrived, I reluctantly shouldered Peri --- the last two days slack packing sure spoilt me! But I love my pack and it wasn't long until we were one with each other again. The trail started out with an easy, paved stroll, then climbed up to Pole Steeple where we took the blue blaze to check out the view for a while. After returning to the trail, Dan and Jessie headed back down the mountain and I pressed on. It was awesome having them out! Guys, your support means the world!The hiking today was pretty great! A couple of short climbs, but it all felt pretty good. I think I'm starting to get my trail legs. And this was my first double digit day with the full pack! As usual, my feet start aching a few miles in, but everything else feels amazing!I'm set up in an ""unofficial"" campsite next to a stream. Ed and Lyle had set up just across the trail.

We hung out for a while enjoying everyone's company, and about 815 a guy rolled in to camp. He, Jelly Dog) was just waiting to meet up with a couple of friends before continuing their 24 mile hike in the dark. Eventually all three guys made it to the camp and were sitting around the fire tearing into their food bags.

I don't know if it was the longer day yesterday, not sleeping great last night, or the five climbs! There was a really neat section called a rock maze that had me going through crevices and climbing four foot high boulders with basically no footholds. Would have been a lot more fun without a pack!But, I made it through and got to the backpacker campsite just south of Boiling Springs. I lounged in the hammock for about an hour and a half before setting up camp, listening to the trains go by 20 feet from my hang. As I'm lounging, Lyle walks up without a pack, carrying some red fountain drink. Apparently they had been waiting for me at the ATC office thinking I would go there for water. He let me know that they had someone from a new, local hostel coming to pick them up in an hour. $10 for dinner, a shower, a bunk, breakfast. Perfect! Glad I had not set up camp yet, I pulled my hammock and headed into town. This was great timing because after the hike today I was really considering taking it easy tonight in a hostel, but the only place anywhere near the area was $40 and required either a hitch or a road walk.Kritter was hanging at the ATC office as well and decide to join us at the hostel. Lisa came to pick us up at six and gave us the grand tour. I hit the shower immediately and gathered all of my dirty clothes which Lisa washed for me for an extra $3. Good deal. I hung out in my rain gear and we made hotdogs, had chips, pickles, and beer around the fire with Lisa's sister, Sue, and Lisa's husband. They have been extremely accommodating, and I saw my first Q-tips in two weeks!! It was amazing (and gross). The company and conversation have been great. It's been really neat to learn about Kritter's lifestyle as a ""traveler"" and his time in the rails.Lisa is taking us back to the trail at 6:15 tomorrow morning. It will be good to get an early start since there is not camping in the Cumberland Valley, so I'll have about a 15 mile day. But, it will be flat through private farmland until the end where I will have a 900 ft climb up to the shelter. Hopefully I will be Ina. Better mind frame for the hike tomorrow. I had been looking forward to hiking through the pasture lands, but after the mile or so through the fields today I'm not as enthused. The trail through the fields is basically a rut. Unfortunately my stride is a little wider than the rut, so I'm either walking on the sloped edge or through the rough grass. Of course, part of that might have been due to my short, exhausted steps! The last climb today was something. Not bad when you have your trail legs I'm sure. But I'm getting there!","Campsite in PA

My feet ache like crazy at the end of every day. Well, it usually starts just a few miles in. But other than that, my body is really holding up. Plus, I've dropped about 15 pounds since I started. The last couple of days I have noticed the hiker hunger starting to peek it's little head up, though I still don't really want to eat while I'm hiking, even when in hungry.??I survived my night in the top (third) bunk last night. Though it was awkward climbing up with only about two feet of room between the bunk and the rafters. I didn't want to deal with my sleeping bag, and the extra blankets provided were undersized, but I made it work. And the bunks were passed, but hard none the less. So, not my best night's sleep on the trail, but I was content with it. I did bang my head on the rafters when I got up, but all was well. I got up at 5am and got packed. We had farm fresh eggs that were collected yesterday cooked in the microwave. :-/ Too bad. But they weren't awful. Lisa ran us back to the ATC office to continue our journey, and we decided to leave our packs and go to Cafe 101 for coffee. We got there at 6:30. They opened at 7. We decided to wait. Eventually we did get our coffee, then sat around for a bit before heading back to the ATC. While getting ready, Ed noticed the scale on the front porch and weighed his pack, so of course we all had to do the same. I had not yet weighted my pack. With (too much) food and three liters of water I was at 38 pounds!!! Way too much! A quick shakedown was in order, so I went through all of my gear. Now, I actually have used everything that I'm carrying so far, except for the emergency gear/first aid stuff. But, I was still able to pull out a few clothing items that I don't absolutely need, and about half of my food. The food and a couple of other items went into the hiker box. [Hiker boxes can be found at various places including hostels, outfitters, some post offices, and some shelters. Basically it is somewhere to discard items that someone else might have use of. And they are great to check out before you resupply. You can find various food and clothing items, half full fuel canisters, bits of gear, you never know.]. Everything else was going to be shipped back to Louisiana, and much of it I will get back with my winter gear. Got my pack weight down to a reasonable 32 pounds with three liters of water and about three days worth of food. I had to keep all of the poor arts because I think one of the packs is watermelon (awesomeness!!) but they aren't marked.I headed over to the post office directly across the street at 8:30 to find that they didn't open until 9! Geez! So I sent Ed, Lyle, and Kritter on their way and I waited for them to open. I was on the trail by 9:05. If you read my post yesterday you might have picked up that I wasn't sure if I was looking forward to all of the field crossings or dreading them. At this point I was kind of dreading them. But it all ended up being amazing. I had pictured walking through nothing but fields for miles and miles. But most of my time was spent in the stands of trees between fields. Occasionally the trail would follow along the side of a field, and a few were crossed over. It was a hot day, but there was enough intermittent shade and water sources that it was very manageable. As I was walking alongside one of the wheat fields this morning, I hear a bleating sound. I pulled out my earbuds to get a better listen, trying to figure out if it was some kind of bird because surely there wouldn't be a lamb in the middle of a wheat field. A few seconds later a tiny, shaky legged fawn wobbled into a rocky clearing. It couldn't have been more than a couple of days old. When it saw me it just crouched down and stayed very still. I expect I could have approached it without it fleeing. But, I didn't want to stress it out any more, and I wanted to respect the farmland, so after a couple of photos I was on my way. I never did see mom.  I was chastised by a trail angel who fed me hotdogs, deviled eggs (I could gobble up a couple more of those right now!) and cupcakes about carrying too much water. According to her there isn't really anywhere that I would need to carry more than two liters. Ah well, I'm getting the hang of it and I started with much less water than I would have two weeks ago. In fact, I started the last big climb with only two liters, and I could have done it with one. It's really a bit of a science, and a bit of an art. Ideally I would get to a water source with no more than half a liter left. But, I'm still a bit afraid of being thirsty.Ed and Lyle got off the trail at a road crossing today. Ed was pretty caught up in hiking and went a couple of miles too far, but Lyle found him and picked him up on the way back out to drop off Kritter who he had shuttled into town to run an errand. They are going to meet us about 2.5 miles up the trail tomorrow morning, pick up our packs, and slack pack is to the Doyle in Duncannon. I had planned to take two days for this 11+ mile stretch, especially after the long day today. But you just can't say no to someone willing to help you hike rock scrambles without a pack!Throughout all of this I was concerned about the climb at the end of the day. Sure, the first 13 miles were relatively flat, but that's a long day, and that last mile and a half was far from flat with about 800 foot elevation gain. Eventually I realized I was being pretty silly. I've done plenty of climbs thus far, and if worse came to worse, I have a head lamp and can night hike. Near the top of the climb there was an epic view point right on the trail. It was the golden hour and the valley below was beautiful! Really helped to settle the mind for the last half hour.There were several times when the trail would climb a bit, just to go back down. A couple of these times I thought to myself how I could be really perturbed about loosing the elevation I had just gained, especially considering how far up I knew I had to go. But I just didn't have it in me to be bothered by it. I'm pleased that it's still so easy for me most of the time to remember why I'm out here and that it's not just about getting where I'm going for the night. It's not really about that at all. Now I'm lying in my hammock, spent, and thoroughly satisfied by the day. The wind is singing through the trees. The temp is perfect. And it's not supposed to rain tonight.I've got quite an early morning tomorrow, and I'm pooped!""I don't want a never-ending life.

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537954,"Up early today and on the trail by 7. Started with a good downhill, then back into some field walking. I stopped 2.3 miles in to wait for Kritter and meet up with Ed and Lyle. They showed up in the truck shortly after Kritter caught up with me. They brought us coffee and breakfast sandwiches which was totally awesome. Also totally awesome, they bought a couple of basic, lightweight day packs. I wouldn't really even call them day packs, but they are perfect for slack packing and light enough to hang on to.We transferee the essentials into the slack packs, then Kritter decided to just ride into Duncannon with the guys. He had beer on his mind! They took Peri (my pack) and we said our goodbyes as they would be on their way back to Michigan before I made it to town. Was great hiking with those two for the last couple of weeks!Then the work began. I had another 8.7 miles to hike, starting with a nice 1000 ft climb, then several miles along the rocky, windy ridgeline. It actually wasn't as rocky as I had expected, but it went on for more than 4 miles and was very tedious trekking. I tweaked my knee when a rock or stick or something slid out from under my foot. It wasn't bad, but definitely enough to remind me to be careful. Resting it tomorrow will be good. It was another hot day, but I was under a dappled canopy almost the entire time, and the wind was strong, keeping the harshness of the summer rays from draining me too much.But man! After the long day yesterday and the fairly technical hike today, I am whipped! I can really feel the effects of longer miles and can tell when my body is getting tired. It's not so much in the way I feel as it is in how often I trip and/or stumble. I will have to watch that and maybe plan shorter days as Pensylvania gets rockier and rockier. It's one thing to trip on a nicely graded, mostly smooth section. It's a whole other thing to recover from a trip when you are scrambling over rocks!There was a truly amazing view of the valley at the end of the ridgeline, but apparently it's popular with the locals and it is a Sunday. There were a lot of folks out and I didn't bother to try to get a decent picture. The mile long, steep decent off the ridgeline got me pretty good. Toward the end of the decent I was coming up to a road and noticed I hadn't gone over the last little 200 ft hill. I pulled out my Guthook app to check the map, and sure enough, I was on the wrong trail! But I wasn't going to go back up the damn mountain to find the trail when the one I was on was about to meet back up with the AT! The route I took was probably 0.1 miles shorter. So, the those hardcore purists, my hike won't be a thru hike unless I go back and pick up that extra 0.1 miles. Come to think of it, maybe I will tomorrow if I need something to do. Would probably be a much more pleasant stroll that it would have been this afternoon.Anyway, I got the the Doyle and Kritter was on the corner with a case of beer waiting for me. We were going to get a double room, and I was just going to have him pay the $10 difference for the upgrade from single since I know he's pretty strapped. But, turns out you can't stay at the Doyle without some form of photo ID. So he moved on. I mentioned a campsite at the edge of town, but he said he had a spot. With my zero tomorrow I don't know if I'll see him again, but I wish him well.I went up to my room (on the fourth floor, what kind of sick joke is that?!?) to deposit my stuff (my pack was waiting for me by the front door when I got here), and noticed that the sheets in the bed were totally filthy. Like grimy filthy. On top and under the top sheet. Now, I've heard the stories about the Doyle. I know it's a shithole, but it's a historic building and a very strong part of AT culture. I don't need much, so I'm okay with the spider webs and bare bulbs dangling from the ceiling, though I think they charge way too much for what you get. But in this case, I wouldn't have even put my sleeping bag on the bed. Still, I have my priorities, and all I really wanted was a coke! So I headed downstairs.I got a chance to ask if I could get a set of clean sheets so I could change them myself before I got a chance to ask for a coke. The guy questioned one of his staff, then gave me a key to a different room. Sooo... Still no coke, and I was hiking back up to the fourth floor to move my gear. The sheets were cleaner, and this room came with a few slider friends in the ceiling corners. Satisfied enough, I headed back down to the bar for my coke (which turned out to be Pepsi) and dinner --- an oyster poboy with fries. It was a little after 4, and I was disappointed to leave that they close the kitchen at 6, because really, this was lunch and I was famished! By the time I finished my food I was painfully stuffed! Of course now, two hours later, I'm starting to get hungry again. Guess that's the way the Hunger comes on.After a shower and some time lounging on the bed trying to decide it I was going to take a nap, I went back down to the bar for a quick drink. A refreshing gin and ginger, because there was no tonic to be had. The sun has just dipped behind the mountains, and the mountain breeze is blowing through my room windows smelling amazing, and an awful lot like the smell of the air in Whitefish. I'm looking forward to sleeping well tonight. I was fitful for a couple of hours last night because it was too hot. I shed all of my clothes, and that still didn't help. Eventually it occurred to my half asleep brain to remove my sleeping pad from my hammock, and that did the trick, but I only got a few hours of decent sleep. I think I might have a bit of a lie in tomorrow!","Darlington Shelter

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538052,"So much for a lie in, I still got up at 6am. But, I slept great and I did take two naps today!No breakfast options around here really, so I picked up a chicken salad sandwich at the quicky mart and had breakfast in the balcony with Jelly Dog and Panda. After breakfast and hanging around a bit I went back to my room for my first nap! ??Woke to a knock on my door and offered reassurance that I would be down to pay for another night. Had an early lunch and then spent a while hanging out with Otey, the creator of the hiker yearbook. He lives out of a converted short school bus. It's pretty sweet, all paneled in cedar, queen size bed, cabin kinda feel. He's been traveling along the trail visiting towns and festivals doing PR and getting material for this year's book, and is about to start a four week section hike.I then went up to my room for another nap and some reading. Figured out my resupply, and headed downstairs to hang out until the 4pm shuttle to the grocery store. Went I got back Andrew and Magma were here. They got settled into their room, then we had dinner and walked down to an ice cream shop about a half mile away. Have been relaxing since then, and will hit the sack pretty soon.

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538211,"I'm stuck in the town vortex!!! Ahhhh!!!So... This morning Andrew, Magma and I went across the street for breakfast where we were joined briefly by Hornet. This was the first time I've ever seen scrapple on a menu, and that holds strong camping memories for me, so I had to get it! It wasn't as good as I remember it cooked in a pie iron over a fire in Curtis Creek Campground in Pisgah National Forest, but it was decent.After breakfast I headed up to my room, packed up and checked out. Magma had been feeling pretty dizzy and had a weird knot on the back of her neck, so Otey shuttled her and Andrew into Harrisburg to visit the ER. Meanwhile, I decided to stick around for a bit until the hotel opened so I could get my passport stamped. The AT passport has been around for a couple of years, and you are able to collect stamps from various places and people along the trail. The Doyle is an iconic part of the trail culture, so this had to be done. While I was waiting, I went down the road for a haircut, but ended up having to make an appointment for about an hour out. I hung out with Horent for a while, got my stamp, then got my haircut. At that point, Hornet and I were going back and forth about whether to hit the trail or stay another night. I got a quick bite to eat, and the next thing I knew it was 1pm. I was still waiting to hear back from Magma, so I went to Vicky and demanded the best room in the hotel! And it worked! I got the corner turret room with three windows and a great view of the street and the mountains. I tossed my pack in the room and Hornet and I went for a little field trip.We went down the street a couple of blocks to visit Trail Angel Mary. He wanted to talk to her about slack packing, and I just wanted to meet her and get her to stamp my passport. A few other hikers were there helping her build bunks. While we were chatting with her three hikers came through to say hey and find out about a shuttle to the grocery store. These kids had been there all of three minutes and she gave them the keys to her van to go to the store. I went along for the ride.When we got back I met up with Hornet again before going to chill in my room for a while. Eventually he and I went down the road to a pizza/sub joint for dinner, we had both had enough of the Doyle's pub fare, as awesome as it is. Eventually we heard from Magma. Otey and I had both been trying to get in touch with them because he had been waiting for about seven hours with no word. Finally he had to leave. She got out not long after he left, and he went back to pick them up. But, on their way back to the Doyle the bus over heated and they were stuck on the side of the freeway with the state troopers showing up! He managed to pull enough water from his toilet system to cool the engine and they made it back to the hotel.Unfortunately Magma is having to get off the trail. Her sister will be in from Rochester tomorrow to pick them up. I'm pretty bummed for them. They had several more weeks planned. I hung out with Indian for a while before heading up to bed. He came through a few months ago when he pulled his hamstring coming down off the last ridgeline. He had planned to recover for a couple of days and wait for a package to come one. Things got screwed up and it took his package two and a half weeks to get here, but in that time he made himself useful to Pat and Vicki, and he has been here helping them out ever since.   After socializing a bit I headed upstairs, took a shower, and got ready to settle in for the night. I had counted thirteen spiders in my room. Now, if you know me you probably know that spiders kinda give me the creeps, but I don't like to kill them. So I decided to just ignore them. That is, until a huge one decided to drop down almost on my head while I was taking a selfie to show off my new haircut!! AHHHH!!!! Still not wanting to kill it, but not wanting it to end up in bed with me either, I used my trekking pole to swipe at the line of web it was dangling from so I could put it out in the hallway. I don't know what was going on with this thing's web, but somehow it ended up coming right for me!!! I barely escaped and it scurried back up to the fan. Now I'm a little unsettled, but I don't know what to do about it, so I escaped back out to the porch hoping the problem would go away if I ignored it.Back outside with Indian we talked a while, then he decided to take me down to the river to see the best view in Duncannon. It was beautiful. You could see the ridge I came in on, and the ridge I would leave on, and the stars were gorgeous. When we got back to the hotel I had resolved myself to initiating the Great Spide Massacre of 2016. I was sad about it, but it had to be done. However, when I got here, I found that the most offending soider had settled itself on the ceiling and seemed pretty content to be there. So I have decided that they will be spared for the time being. Hopefully I will not have any spider stories to relay tomorrow...","The Doyle Hotel - Duncannon, PA

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538331,"I finally escaped the town vortex! I said my goodbyes to Andrew and Magma and then hit the trail. The first two miles was a leisurely, flat stroll through town, leading to crossing the Juniata River and the Susquehanna River. Crossed a couple of railroad tracks, then headed up the ridge that I've been looking at for two days. It was a nice climb of about 1000 ft, then ROCKS!! The first mile or so along the ridgeline was very rocky. I was using hands and poles, climbing over rocks from one side of the ridge to the other, practically bouldering a couple of times! I got to the first shelter 4.5 miles in and stopped for lunch. I also reupped my water because the only water source for the next 13 miles was a seasonal spring at the next shelter about 7 miles further up the trail. I debated staying at that first shelter for a while. It was only 1pm, but I wasn't going to make it 7 miles in any kind of reasonable time if the terrain continued as it had been. Finally I decided to press on, and I would find a place to stop and camp early if I needed to. Fortunately, the terrain really tamed up after that first shelter and it was pretty smooth going. Though at the end of another eleven and a half mile day I was glad to arrive at Peters Mountain Shelter. There were at least 11 other people here when I arrived, but it's a big, two story shelter, so there was plenty of room. We all sat around doing the dinner thing. I wasn't about to waste water cooking and cleaning pots because, although the seasonal spring is running well, it's a 300 ft elevation drop to get to it!Some of the guys got a fire going and we hung out for a while chatting and sharing trail stories. I'm here with Mango, Gulp, Salty, Yeti, Kritter, and a bunch of other people who's names I don't know. The next shelter is 18 miles up the trail, so I'll be camping somewhere between here and there tomorrow night. Unfortunate since it is supposed to rain tomorrow night. I have not yet had to deal with wet gear on this trip and I'm not looking forward to it. There's a nice rain coming down now, but we are all dry in the shelter.It was a good day. My feet are doing good. I've readjusted my laces again and the toe numbness isn't as bad. I'm not sure if they are still goingbablittke numb or if that's just residual even after two zero days. I was pretty damn worried about the rocks after that first mile on the ridgeline, but the rest of the trail was beautiful. Though, part of that is me just getting used to the smaller rocks EVERYWHERE! Lots of great views today. If Pensylvania keeps up like this where it's really rocky for a mile or so, then not so bad for a while, I will be a happy camper.Town was great, but I'm happy to be back on the trail and back in the woods and mountains.

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538452,"Pretty uneventful hiking day. Woke to a foggy morning after last night's rain. That continued into a foggy day with showers here and there. Saw very few people on the trail. The last few miles were rough, though not so much because of the trail. When I noticed the 3.5 mile climb that I would be ending my day with it just kinda put me in a ""meh"" mood. But, the climb wasn't bad. I took too many breaks mostly because I was dreading such a long climb, but it ended up being a pretty hike. I'm on another ridgeline now.I got into camp and got set up. I love hammock camping, and I love listening to the rain while I'm sleeping in my hammock. But, killing time or doing various camp chores (like eating) in a hammock in the rain is a bit of a pain. I'm the only one here tonight. I got settled in around 630 because I didn't have anything better (or dryer) to do, and I read for a bit. Still plenty of light out, but I think I'm going to call it a night. The rain should pick up in earnest this evening, but should be over by about 5 tomorrow morning. No one likes to deal with wet gear, but I'll be happy if I don't have to deal with wet gear in the rain. And if I don't have to get up in the middle of the rainy night to pee! :-)Did meet a couple of cool folks at the shelter this morning as I was heading out. Groceries and Boy Floyd are doing a 600 mile section southbound. They are a super sweet couple, and he and I got to geek out a bit as he is a mathematician as well, teaching college freshmen out in Arizona. Too bad they were going to other way, they would have been fun to camp with for a couple nights.Everything is kind of damp, and I'm a bit chilled.

It never did rain properly, but everything was a little damp so I let it all dry out. The hiking today was about the same as yesterday, though no real elevation changes. I stopped for lunch for about an hour and relaxed with some reading. Not too many people on the trail the last couple of days, mostly thru hikers, a section hiker here and there. I only had eight miles planned. About a mile from the shelter I felt a weird sensation in my left hamstring, seemly in one of the large tendons. It was like a sudden, mild stinging feeling that kind of radiated. It happened mid-stride on pretty level ground. I continued to feel it every now and then as I would stride forward with that leg. Not bad, but a little disconcerting. Settled into the shelter with Grub, Sunny Side Up, Bigfoot and Sacagawea.    Several others are tent camping, Emerald, Taco, Doubtfire, Moonshine, Chestnut, maybe others. This is a pretty sweet shelter with a large fire pit, a table built around an old tree stump, and a pipe spring right out front. I'm listening to the water trickle as I lie in my sleeping bag. Would like to do 13 tomorrow to get to the next shelter, but that might be a little too ambitious right now. Will see how it goes. I will have to decide if I want to go into town tomorrow to resupply, wait another day, or try to make it 40 miles into Port Clinton on what I have.

That's the good news...Hung around the shelter fairly late with Grub (and her pup Medusa), Sacagawea, Sunny Side Up, and Baby Face. Hit the trail at about 9:15. It was an eventful night in the shelter apparently. Sometime during the night there was a loud scream back behind the shelter that was described as sounding like someone screaming ""no"" at the top of their lungs. I didn't hear this, guess I slept pretty soundly. Also had a couple of late hikers come in. I remember hearing someone walk up to the shelter, but I didn't pay any attention to it. I guess with four other people and a pit bull I wasn't too worried. And, at one point, Medusa sat at the edge of the shelter and growled at something in the night for about 10 minutes. I missed that too.We noticed this morning that there was someone tucked in a sleeping bag along the side of the shelter under the eaves. Guess he didn't feel like pitching his tend when he got in late.Had a beautiful hike this morning. Decent climb early on that went great, great weather, interesting scenery. Then, about six miles in, that hamstring twinge that I had yesterday returned with a vengeance! I was in a pretty populated area of a state park, and was about to start a 1000 ft, one mile climb up to the next ridgeline. I decided to just go with it and see how things turned out. By the way, I'm a little over ridgelines...The next seven miles were not my favorite on the AT. There were a couple of areas of legit rock scrambles, but the trail was mostly pretty great, thank God. I kept trying to calculate my pace, trying to figure out if I would make it to the shelter before dark. My headlamp has been rather unreliable, and I expect I will need to replace it.Made it to the shelter with plenty of time, and ended up setting up my hang next to Emerald. I had planned to stay in the shelter, but word is there are kids down there, so decided to stay close to the trail. Jen and Tim are a couple of weekenders who are out just for tonight and were already setup in the campsite as well as thru hiker, Hopper.As we were eating dinner and hanging around the fire (Jen and Tim shared some red wine and some chicken sausage with us) Grub and Medusa showed up, followed shortly by Trix. Trix had some Cecilian pizza that she had carried out from town today that she shared with me. This was all great because I couldn't be bothered to cook anything (even if doing so wouldn't require a trip to the spring), so I had had a pepperoni stick and a pack of tuna for dinner.As we were talking I discovered Jen and Tim are rugby players, so we had plenty to talk about. It's a beautiful night and I decided to hang without the rain fly tonight.Tomorrow I will hike up the trail two miles to a road crossing where I will get a hitch into town. I'm worried about my hamstring and want to at least give it a day off, maybe try to find a doctor. The pain is tolorable, but my concern is that I might have a partial tear or something and that continuing to hike on it could do some serious damage. I'm not pleased. I was feeling really great today, and am ready to start upping the miles again.I wonder if my knee brace isn't putting some kind of weird strain on that tendon. I think I'll hike the two miles out tomorrow without the brace. Yesterday it felt fine around camp, and those first six miles today were awesome. It's a little sore around camp tonight, but barely noticeable. Here's hoping a day of rest and maybe limiting my brace time will help.","Rausch Gap Shelter

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538996,"Uneventful day. Rested up in the hotel room all day. Picked up lunch from McDonalds next door and resupply from Dollar General, also next door.Can't really say much about how the leg is doing since it has been mostly fine until a few miles in. Even then, when it acts up, it's easy enough to hike through. My concern is that if I have a partial tear in my hamstring tendon and I continue to push it I will risk rupturing it fully. That would be extremely painful, would require surgical repair, and I don't know how well I would be able to hike out with that injury.Something that most of you may not realize that feeds this concern is that last fall when I had my ACL reconstructed, they took the graph from my hamstring tendon. A little research today confirmed that the graft was indeed taken from the area that is giving me problems. When they take such a graft they do so by removing the middle third of the tendon. So the problems I'm having now are probably because that little bit of me was already compromised.I would like to push on the next 28 miles to Port Clinton and see how it does. I would be even more comfortable with this if there had been some precipitating event that had caused the pain I'm having now, maybe some kind of over extension, or a fall, or a weird twist. Since it simply happened while walking on a fairly level section of trail I'm guessing that it's an over-use type of injury. That being the case, I don't know what to try to protect it from or how.One option that I'm looking at is just taking things super slow if it continues to act up, doing very low mileage days. So I've picked up resupply for about five days, usually WAY too much for 28 miles. But, even between here and Port Clinton the terrain is supposed to start getting rockier. Not much in the way of elevation changes, but I hear tell of some worthy rock scrambles. Another option is to head home, get my passport renewed, then jet off to the Virgin Islands for a couple of weeks, then Australia for a couple months! Pretty decent consolation, but I'm not ready to leave the trail yet.I don't know what I will do yet. I might try to get my surgeon on the phone tomorrow.

There were some really great views of the valley. Stopped for a bit to enjoy an apple and the sun on a rocky overlook. Got to the shelter early where I found three thru hikers including Hawk and Yard Sale who were just stopping in after a resupply trip to town. They went on their way after a while, and before long a few more people came by. There were a couple of guys from Germany who stopped in to use the solar shower, and Dueces and another guy stopped to relax a bit, while Sweets stopped just love my enough for lunch.I put off ordering pizza as long as I could, thinking if other hikers showed then the delivery guy might not have to make so many trips. Finally at 6:30 I gave in and placed my order. Another couple, Carter and Caitlin, rocked up around 8. They had picked up dinner in town, but managed a couple of slices of pizza since I way over ordered. We hung around for a while talking about our hikes, gear, people we know on the trail, and various other things before hitting the sac.This shelter is pretty great. It's a proper building with doors and bunks for 12, solar shower, picnic tables, a power outlet on the front porch of the caretaker's house next door, games, books, pizza delivered, a sky light that would be amazing during a thunderstorm.

Can't say yet how my hammie is going to do, but I'm ready to find out. While laying around the hotel the other day I almost went ahead and bought a one way ticket to Australia.

",501 Shelter,"Jun 22, Wed",1.80
Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539469,"From my limited (near 200 miles) experience, there are four types of rocks on the trail that are worthy of your consideration...First, we have what I this morning heard referee to as ""baby head"" rocks. Though I would say that the size ranges from infant to adult. I have talked about these before. Hiking over them is like trying to walk over a ton of semi-stable softballs, except with more pointy edges. These are also referred to as ankle-breakers. They aren't usually a whole lot of fun.Then we have what we might refer to as rock scrambles, but on the more take side. Boulder field is also a common term, though they usually aren't huge boulders. These can range in side from an iPad to a small dining table. These are kinda fun, though not for prolonged periods of time. One traverses these by rock hopping (or just rock stepping). Staying on the rocks conserves energy, and if you ever have need of stepping between rocks it's a good idea to watch for snakes and have a plan B. Watch for snakes because PA rattle snakes like to sun in these rocky areas and aren't as apparent if they are between rocks. Have a plan B because sometimes you are thinking that you are stepping down into hard ground or dirt covered rock between boulders, but you discover that you are merely stepping onto a this layer of leaves and dirt being helped up in the crevice between the boulders. Good way to break a leg or an ankle. Keeping that in mind, finding the right rocks to step on is kind of like a video game. I imagine the Mario castle lever music going on... Duna Duna Duna, Dunt Duna Duna Duna... You learn to read these Boulder fields. You can figure out my the general shape and angle of the rock, the position of the rock with respect to those around it, and the sound achieved when tapped with a trekking pole if a rock is likely to move under foot and what the nature of that movement will be as you shift your weight across the boulder. Again, fun for limited periods of time.Then there is the bouldering rocks. This is when you have to use your hands and you are climbing over large boulders, hefting yourself up or lowering yourself down. These are fun also, but can be exhausting quickly and often are not well blazed.Finally we come to the fourth kind. This is my least favorite. In fact, I kinda hate this type of rock... These are the rocks that are mostly buried except for the pointy corner bits that stick up a bit from the ground. You won't always see these because they are often covered with a later of duff or leaves.! But it doesn't really matter anyway. These tend to be so prevalent in the area where they exist that even if you can see them, you still have no choice but to walk right over top of them. Yeah yeah, not a big deal...for a few steps! Do this for a couple of miles and see how you feel. These kill the feet, but there's not really anything to be done about it. You just resign yourself to the ache and pain...I got to spend time with all but the bouldering rocks today.Late start today. Caitlyn and Carter (AKA, Add Coffe and Welcome Back) are bad influences and we hung around the shelter until after 11. Just before we left a southbound section hiking couple came up and we chatted with them for a bit. Turns out they are caretakers for Tumbling Run Shelter, and I had met him when I was staying there.I left out just after the others. It was a slow day on the trail people wise. I only saw three hikers and one trail runner all day. There were a couple of nice views, and I made a few video calls to some folks to rub it in! :-)I had been told of a swimming hole near the Hertline campsite and took the blue blaze to check it out. The creek had been dammed, and it be rested a great, deep reservoir on one side of the dam and a small waterfall on the other. I soaked my feet for a while and had some lunch. Too bad it wasn't hotter, would be a great place to cool off, especially with that rope swing! This was almost six miles into my day, and I considered setting up camp. I AM taking it easy after all...I decided to press on and left the campsite at 5 with 3.3 miles to go to get to the campsite I had picked out. Starting to feel like a thru hiker, pressing on into the early evening.I was trucking along pretty well and was about two miles from the campsite. Then, everything happened so fast! I took my first real spill, thwarted by a couple of large sticks in the trail! What I think happened was that one of my trekking poles caught the stick then I tripped over the trekking pole! I went down hard. Hit my right knee, barely got my hands up, though tangled in my trekking poles.! I did manage to get my hands up enough to break my fall sufficiently that I barely felt the rock that I hit my head on. The wind was knocked out of me and my legs were a jumble of legs, large trippy sticks, and trekking poles. My hands were attached to the trekking poles making maneuverability difficult. I eventually disentangled myself and decided that it would be a good time for a break. So I sat in the ferns on the side of the trail catching my breath and assessing a tender wrist. I was worried I might have sprained it which would make using the trekking poles very difficult. Fortunately, after a few minutes it was good to go. No remaining pain now.Back on the trail, I knew I had to stop at a spring a quarter mile before the campsite as I was down to about a quarter liter of water. The trail turned right, the blue blaze for the spring turned left. As I went to turn left my eyes caught a glimps of a cooler and I headed right. Score! Trail magic! And it wasn't empty! I had hoped for water so I wouldn't have to go to the spring, but found none. Was still happy for a Starbucks via refresher! As I read the note (can be seen in the pics) I considered my options. I was ready to camp, I was less that a quarter mile from my site. Why bother doing anything else when I was ready to camp? Ya see, the trail magic letter also had a phone number and an offer of a bed, shower, laundry, etc for $5. I finally decided that the trail is about the experience and interacting with various people. I will have plenty of time to camp by myself! So I called him up and got directions. While he did make it clear that I could go in and make myself comfortable, I chose to wait in the yard by the pond, lying on my back looking into a beautiful sky. When the guy, Breath Easy made it home I got the grand tour and we sat straight down for dinner. A lady from his church had sent him home with two plates of shepherd's pie and pasta salad, as well as a half gallon of ice cream. After dinner we got laundry started and I grabbed a shower while Breath Easy hiked Dian to his trail magic to refresh it for tomorrow. While there he ran into mint and pepper who had already set up camp, but will be joining us for breakfast.

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539571,"Lovely day. Mint and Peper showed up at the house at about 615 to join us for breakfast. Good food and good conversation with good people, then we went out so Mint could have a go on Breath Easy's epic swing.Back on the trail, I was feeling pretty sleepy despite the early trail magic we came upon. Sir, who thru hiked with his wife last year, had oranges and bananas and watermelon and chocolate milk and hot dogs and beer! I stuck with some fruit and some chocolate milk. Back on the trail (again), I had been planning to camp past the next shelter, before town. Then I decided I could go ahead and make it into town. Grub is in Port Clinton and last I talked to her she hadn't decided when she was headed out. I was calculating mileage and pace in my head, comparing with daylight hours, etc. then, I decided I didn't want to stress about all of that and I would just plan to make it into town tomorrow. That decide, and given my sleepy state, about 11 I put my hammock up along the side of the trail to relax. I ended up chilling and reading for almost an hour and a half before Yard Sale (a different one than he who I met at the 501 shelter a couple of days ago) released a startled cry shortly after passing me. I didn't hear that followed up by the thud of a falling body, so I ignored it. That was, until he hollered out, ""Hey, has anyone told you about this big rattlesnake yet?"" WHAT?!? I slipped my bare feet into my boots and tromped over to take a gander. Yep. A big, fat, rattling rattlesnake was on the side of the trail expressing its disapproval of our presence. Yard Sale kind of gave a nervous giggle when it wouldn't move, and he was worried he would have to jump over it. Eventually he was able to skirt around it. I decided it was time to pack up and get out of there while I knew where the snake was rather than waiting for it to hide itself in the ferns right along the edge of the trail. I actually wasn't sure it would still be in sight when I passed, but I thought it best to press on. Welp, when I stepped back on the trail there it was. Stretched out along the middle of the trail and kind of coming in my direction... I took a couple steps back. After a few minutes it slunk far enough into the bushes that I felt safe skirting around. It's tail was still out in the trail, but I had a pretty good bead on its head.As I set off again down the trail I mostly just wanted to chill and read, so I decide that not only would I not try to make it into town, but I was going to stop at the shelter to chill for the evening! A couple miles up the trail I took a bit of a break to continue enjoyed the day and reading for another half hour or so.Eventually I did make it to the shelter. I spent the evening going back and forth between being social at the shelter and chilling in my hang reading. I found a sign with a lookout marked, so I followed the trail back behind the shelter. It led to a little window break in the trees that gave a nice view of the mountains across the way. I'm settled nicely into my hammock and looking forward to a nice sleep.Here tonight we have One Feather, Torch, Data, Beefcake, Yard Sale, and a few others.","Trail angel's house

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539710,"So much for getting out of camp early!By the time I filtered water from the trickling spring it was 9:45.Started out feeling great with some nice stretches of trail. Did 2.5 miles in the first hour! (BTW, that's a pretty decent pace.) After a 30 minute lunch break, the trail got rockier. And rockier. And ROCKIER!! I'm sure y'all are tired of reading my whining about the rocks, but man! Ouch!!I just kept my head down and plugged away at it. Those nice stretches early on where awesome! It was nice to be able to look up rather than staring at the rocks under my feet all day, but this afternoon that's all I could muster. Had one really steep climb. It was only about 250 ft gain, but steep! I spent most of the afternoon dreading the drop into town. As I have said before I don't really dread the climbs or descents, usually. But I knew this one would be a beast! Dropping 1000ft in about .75 miles. The elevation profile practically looked vertical! Drops like that really tend to hurt. They go quicker than climbs, but they are hard on the body and are exhausting because I'm totally tense fighting gravity's pull. It was just as bad as expected! And the rocks the second half of the day really neat up my feet before I even got to the drop! But I made it down and into town. The barber shop here is supposed to be super hiker friendly, even for just hanging out, so That's where I planned to head. Unfortunately they were closed for the day! There is a pavilion .2 miles from the trail (which goes through town) where they allow hikers to camp. I had planned to stay there tonight, but it was hot and I was beat, so I headed to the Port Clinton Hotel.I got a room, took a shower, and headed down to get some food. While waiting for my burger and fries I started talking to and joined Shadow Fox, Yukon, Little Red, and Tumbleweed. The trail is such an amazing community. It's very social, and you basically have instant friends whenever another hiker is around. Turns out this gang was at the shelter last night, but they showed up after I had tucked away for the night.Eventually we decided to head to the Fire Company, a hiker friendly, members only club. A couple of the members that were there signed us in. We enjoyed our time hanging with the locals, playing pool and darts, and drinking $1.25 drafts. Around 10 we left and parted ways when I headed for the hotel and they headed to the pavilion. I really should have stayed at the pavilion, though the shower was nice. The hotel is decent, but more of a private room hostel than what one would expect a hotel to be, and way to expensive for what it is. Ah well, I'll get a good night's sleep. If I stay in town another night, which I might because I really need to hit the post office to ship some stuff home, I will stay at the pavilion.A side note about PA... I am a member of an Appalachian Trail women's group on Facebook. The other day someone posted about their thru hike that started in Harper's Ferry and ended 200 miles later here in Port Clinton. She wasn't having fun and was miserable on the trail. It's a very supportive group and everyone had really positive things to say. I mean, 200 miles is no little thing. I found a lot of the comments interesting... Many of them basically said hat this is the most hated part of the trail for most thru hikers. PA is tough. I've even heard people comment on how they feel sorry for flip floppers because they have to start with this. That was all very reassuring! There are times that really suck for sure! These days there are even times I am cursing this state as I trek along (usually very slowly). But I'm still not ready to give up the trail life! Still being able to enjoy myself despite how much most people hate this section (I don't have much to compare it to) makes me happy! I can't wait for New Jersey! I'll keep taking it easy over the rocks as needed. If long miles make me miserable, then I'll hike shorter miles for as long as I want to. Though I am hopeful that things will speed up after the rocks. 78 miles to get out of PA! But I have enjoyed this state. The people are great, the few views are nice, and it's best to experience a new state on the trail!","Eagle's Nest Shelter

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539874,"9 am checkout at the hotel. Blah. I caught a ride into the World's Largest Cabella's with a hiking couple that was at the hotel last night and at the shelter the night before that, T-ore and Data. I had a few things on my list, but ended up only purchasing a new midweight layer. I then trekked over the parking lots and roads to the nearby Walmart for resupply. I hit up the Subway in Walmart, saving the other half of my sandwich for dinner. I met Wind Walker and a couple of other hikers just outside of the store as we repackaged our resupply. Packaging is often bulky and redundant so everything usually needs to be broken down and replaced into the food bag. This also gives other people a chance to see you. Wind Waljer commented that he often feels like he is on display like an zoo exhibit. But, this is a great way to get a ride back to the trail. Often times someone will stop to chat then offer a ride.I really didn't want to do the 1.7 mile road walk along the highway back to Port Clinton, especially with a full resupply and a couple of redundant items from my new purchases weighing my pack down. I sat outside of Walmart for a while, even asking a couple of people if they were heading into Port Clinton, but had no luck. Finally I decided to get it over with and hit the pavement. I didn't get too far with my thumb out before a woman and her teenage daughter pulled up behind me on the highway to give me a quick lift. My first hitch hike with my thumb and everything and I didn't even die!!! Yay!!! Check that one off the bucket list!Back at the Port Clinton hotel I ordered an appetizer and hung around for a couple of hours reading before deciding to go on down to the Pavilion. There I met Duct Tape and Dweller who had gotten in last night and were staying another night with their tent set up under the cover. I hung my hammock and pretty much spent the rest of the day reading. It was glorious! Tomorrow I will head to the post office which unfortunately doesn't open until 12:30 to send home the items that today's purchases made redundant and a few things I haven't been using enough or have decided I can live without. Dropping weight little by little!","Port Clinton Hotel

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540006,"Woke up fairly early considering I had to wait around for the PO to open at 12:30. Walked down the road the the 3C's Family Restaurant for breakfast which was great. Walking back to the pavilion, all I really wanted to do was lounge around and read, so I made a decision... My plan had been to get 5 miles up the trail this afternoon to the first shelter, then push on the the next tomorrow. Well, the second shelter is only 15 miles up the trail, so i decided I could get an early start tomorrow and do the 15 miles to the Eckville shelter. So, a day for reading and still make the same mileage!At the pavilion tonight we have an older German couple, Firefly, Arrow, Fish, Giggles, and sole guy who's name I didn't get. Q-Tip was in earlier today, but then decided to push on after all.Maybe after the trail I can find a way to get paid to hike a little and hang around in my hammock and read a lot. I don't want to review books or even discuss them necessarily. I just want to read them. Think someone will pay me to do that?I'm very glad I brought my Kindle, even though most people end up sending theirs home.Speaking of sending home... Today I sent home my 2L hydration bladder, rain paints, base layer top, fleece, and MY STOVE! Yep! I've decided to be one of the stoveless on the trail. In the last two weeks I think I have only used it twice. I don't really want the pasta and rice sides that most people cook on them. I've been carrying around the same ones for a couple weeks because I never want to eat them! And I don't want to have to deal with cleaning my lot. So, by giving up the stove I also got rid of my pot and fuel canisters, so that should save me a little weight. I'll probably have it sent back with my cold weather gear when a hot meal will be more appreciated.","Port Clinton Pavilion

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540176,"Went back to 3Cs for breakfast this morning, then packed up and headed into downtown. The server at the restaurant warned me of really bad weather with ""line winds"" (whatever that means) expected for the afternoon, so that was in the back of my mind all morning. As I headed into town I decided to go for, I was going to get a haircut. A serious haircut. I stopped at the barbershop and spent a little while enjoying good company and good music. A local, Tex, came in to jam. He played a bunch of old songs, told a bunch of corny jokes, and entertained us with all the gusto he could manage! He was adamantly against me getting my head shaved, but as is my standard, I completely ignored him. The Shepherd came in with Sequoia, and tried to convince me to keep some of the color by getting a Mohawk. When that didn't work he tried to convince me to get the AT symbol shaved into the back of my head. I ignored him too. But, Sequoia decided to go with the shaved in AT. I was worried about the shape of my head, that it might be lumpy or excessively pointy. But I've got to say, I have a great shaped head! I had it shaved not quite to the skin, and I absolutely love it!Arrow and Firefly came in after their trip to Cabella's and they, along with Sequoia and The Shepherd caught a shuttle up to Blue Rocks Campground to get a cabin and wait out the storm. Meanwhile, Skibo came in off the trail and while we were hanging out Denim showed up as well. Skibo and I were debating the weather issue and settled in splitting a room at the hotel. But, his finances fell through, so we headed back down to the pavilion to wait out the storm.It was another lovely afternoon of hanging out and reading. Throughout the afternoon and evening people trickled in and we ended up with about 15 in and around the pavilion. What didn't show up was the bad weather!!! Argh!!It did rain a bit later in the evening, but it definitely wouldn't have been an issue with hiking. Oh well, at least I've got a badass haircut!","Port Clinton Pavilion

Steve, who hangs out at the barber shop and shuttles hikes for a very low rate, pulled up as I was starting down the road. ""Get in the front seat and I'll take you to the barber shop."" Well, I wasn't going to the barber shop Steve, I was going to the trail! Oh well, coffee and donuts is a good idea, I haven't eaten breakfast.So there I was, back at the barbershop hanging with Steve. Tex showed up again to play for us including some original songs. What a hoot! He played City of New Orleans at my request, and that was a real treat. One of the guys we camped with whose name I never got along with Skibo came in. Nameless waited around for a haircut, then about 1030 announced he was going to make the two mike walk to Walmart, so I hooked him up with a shuttle from Steve. I had decided to wait for the hotel to open and leave town after I grabbed a salad there for lunch. Well, Steve invited me to ride along, and of course I agreed. He took us around Hamburg to Walmart, Cabella's, and a couple of other places. Once back in Port Clinton, I did get my salad. Keeping the scurvy at bay! Then back to the barber shop to let my food settle. When I went in to say goodbye, the father of the father son barber duo started chatting me up about how I should join the service, how his niece joined and found a husband. Haha, wow! When he found out I was hiking (really dude, I'm sure you know everyone in this town, what did you think I was doing here?!?!) he was kind enough to inform me that I shouldn't be hiking alone. Then he let me know I should have a weapon, a machete would be good. He bought three machetes in Mexico for $10, gave two to his sons... It was an aground interesting conversation! I nodded, smiled politely... Wait, no, that's not how I roll. I told him it is what it is and things would go down as they would. And p.s. I don't want or need a man, but I still might join the service! Haha!Anyway, I finally got out of there with concerned well wishes from all of the men and a big hug from Steve. I was back on the trail! Finally! I really enjoyed my time in Port Clinton though. I don't regret the time I took off the hang there. The guys were a real trip!I didn't get out until 2, so I headed for the next shelter 6 miles up. I even debated just going a couple of miles to finiah the big climb out of town, then setting up camp early to relax and read. But no, I needed to keep making progress! Plus, I've got someone who I planning to pick me up from Wind Gap 60 miles or so up the trail.The hike today was pleasant enough, and the big climb was definitely a climb!! As I rolled into the shelter I hit 200 miles! Now, it should be at least 300, but y'all know how much I apparently like my zero days!We are expecting good weather tonight and fir the next day or so.

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540326,"Woke up to a couple of people chatting it up right outside my hammock. I didn't want to be social first thing in the morning, so I just snuggled down until they left. Once up I got packed up pretty quick then spent a little while hanging with Shaggy and Wanderer. Left the shelter at about 9:30 and headed right into a climb. It was about 800 ft, steep in some places, and pretty darn rocky. But, I was rewarded with views from John's Pulpit right at the top of the climb. Caught up with Thin Mint and Pyro here, along with a few of their friends day hiking with them. Also found Tree (Nameless from yesterday's post) and Skibo who had camped there last night. Must have been beautiful! After hanging there soaking in the view for a while I pressed on. A couple miles up the (ugh, rocky) trail I reached the Pinnacle. Supposed to be the best view in PA, and I believe it! Nice 270(ish) degree view. Hung out there and enjoyed a lunch of lemon pepper salmon and ritz. Was not looking forward to another five miles of rocky trail!It was nice to find that not far past the Pinnacle the trail coincided with a nice, mostly flat, relatively rockless, shaded roadbed. I kept holding my breath, trying to enjoy it while it lasted. Guys! This went on for almost four and a half miles! It was a great break from all of the rocks. There were still some small rocks, still had to pay attention to my foot placement, but it was a nice change. Though, different terrain, eventually my feet weren't necessarily loving it. Had it been much longer I might have been at risk for some blisters. It was also a little more boring than most of the trail. And I was constantly worried that the trail would split off from the roadbed and I wouldn't notice! I ended up back in the woods for the last .7 miles.Just as I got to the road crossing that would take me to the shelter, there were two women setting up camp and preparing to do trail magic. Apparently Miss Janet is ill and they were there on her behalf. I chugged a root beer while kicking it with Skibo who was pressing on further down the trail and took a coke to go for dinner. Thin Mint and Pyro's friends were picking them up at the shelter and taking them to Chipotle and I was going to pass my order along with them to be brought back to the shelter!This is a pretty nice shelter. Tricks, who I had seen in Duncannon and who saw me though we never spoke, was here when I arrived. He sent me out to the cooler at his truck for yet another coke. I got set up in the 6 person bunkhouse then hit the solar shower! Cold (solar, ha!) but refreshing! It was nice to get a little of the stink out. I then learned that Chipotle had fallen through, and we were contemplating sweet talking Tricks into a pizza run. About that time a car pulled up, and FOB, another thru hiker, and his wife got out carrying a pizza, breadsticks, a 2 liter, and a bunch of cookies. Amazing! Us nonvegitarians each got two pieces of pizza while the herbavoirs split the breadsticks. It was perfect! Several people went to set up their tents in the nice little camping area across the street while I hung around the shelter chatting with Tricks and Crow (who I camped next to but didn't meet last night). We told stories and jokes back and forth. The caretaker came out with Popsicles for all of the hikers, and I scored a donut and a few chips from Tricks. I'm settled into the bunkhouse now with Sunshine and Crow. Thin Mint, Pyro, Tree, and Wanderer are camping across the street.I have been a little apprehensive about tomorrow's rocky hike over Knife's Edge in the rain, but turns out Knife's Edge is 14 miles up, so I will hit it on Saturday, which should be nice and sunny. The next shelter is about 7 miles up, so I should really push past that. We will see what the terrain is like and how I'm feeling.","Windsor Furnace Shelter

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540451,"Nice morning around Eckville. Sunshine took off early and when I woke up properly Crow and Tricks were gone as was Tricks' car, all there gear was still there though. Took my time getting off as usual. Tricks had left some donuts and bananas. They showed back up eventually, they had gone down to the 3Cs restaurant and would have had me come but I was out to the world. I've spent enough time there though, I didn't feel like I had missed out. I ran down to the tent site to chat with Pyro and Thin Mint who were being picked up by a friend later in the morning. Tree headed out planning 12 miles while I was there.When I got back to the bunkhouse Crow was gone, and I saw no sign of Tricks so I headed out. I stopped in at the trail magic set up that was right on the trail. They were setting up when I came in yesterday afternoon and I got a coke. This morning I got some coffee, cheese, sausage, and a muffin. Perfect, cause I wasn't really into the donuts.Big climb early today. I've noticed a bit of a trend with that. Often the day starts with a 1000 ft climb. I've got to stop psyching myself out over those. It's not a big deal, and I know I can do them without much problem, but I get kind of grumpy about it and take more breaks than I really need to. Crow had reported that the news at the restaurant was forecasting storms at 3:30, so we had both decided to stop at the next shelter. 7.4 miles up, no prob. The trail was rocky for sure, but not terrible. I think I might be getting used to it! Ugh! I am definitely getting better at navigating the boulder fields!It was getting fairly dark with the clouds rolling in, so I checked the weather... 2pm thunderstorms?!? That doesn't fit my plans!!! I hit up a spring on a side trail, but realized very quickly I should have just conserved water before I got to that point. This trail was steep AF! Fortunately it wasn't far. Still had to tuck my full water bottle into my bra and use my trekking poles in earnest on the climb back to the trail.I tried to pick up some speed, but it was 130 and I was still more than three miles from the shelter. But, I wanted to clear as many rocks as I could before the rain. It started out with a gentle pitter patter that had been preceded by rolling thunder. Checking the radar pulled up a dark red blob almost on top of me. Now, I don't mind hiking in the rain. In fact I rather enjoy it! I don't even mind the lightening if I'm not too exposed. But, I didn't know what was coming up and I was worried about scrambling around on slick rocks. As the storm really started in I came upon a great little campsite. 2.5 miles from the shelter I stood for a couple of minutes debating before deciding to throw up the tarp and hammock, break out the kindle adm wait out the weather. A reprieve was expected in about 40 minutes. By 3pm the forecast was looking good for a couple of hours so I packed up and headed back out. The rocks weren't bad. I had just had a conversation with Crow about how much easier it is if you walk along the top of the big boulders, stepping or hopping from one to the next. But, with everything being wet now, there were many times I chose a route that would allow me to step around and between the boulders. Better than risking the slippage! All went well and I rolled into the shelter to find Crow, Skibo, Tree, Shaggy (a different Shaggy), and another guy taking a nap. We set about with normal shelter life, chatting, collection wood and water, fiddling with gear, etc. I set my hammock and tarp out to dry which didn't take long. Skibo and Tree kept the fire going all evening and Skibo collected some sassafras root and made us sassafras tea that was actually quite good! I'm in the shelter tonight with Crow, Sojo, Lion Heart, and two other guys. Tree, Skibo, Shaggy, and two other guys are tenting/hammocking. Gunna do a little reading and call it a night.

BUT OH MY LORD THE ROCKS!!!Discussing upcoming water sources in camp this morning (water is starting to be an issue), and we realized that there was a restaurant 4.1 miles up the trail that is hiker friendly! I got out of camp at 8:30 and the trail was so nice I made it in 1.5 hours! I waited for Criw at the road crossing for about 15 minutes then we headed to the Blue Mountain Summit Restaurant and B&B. The website said they opened at 11, so we spent an hour hanging around their beautiful back lawn and Skibo, Tree and a few others showed up. Then, when the doors didn't open we noticed their posted hours had them opening at noon! So we waited around another hour. Salad, burger, fries, and lots of coke and I was a happy camper! Onward!The trail got and stayed pretty rocky, but I'm getting darn good at the boulder hopping and it's starting to be fun. I was glad for all of the recent practice I've had when I got to Knife's Edge. No way would I have done that traverse in bad weather!! It was pretty ridiculous at some points, and I highly recommend the butt slide technique for a couple of spots! But it was neat and the views were spectacular!Again the trail stayed rocky for a while, eventually giving way to about a mile of relative smoothness right before Bake Oven Knob Road. The holiday weekend brought out all of the day hikers, and Bake Oven Knob is popular because it offers great views a half mile and only a 160ft climb from the parking lot. Most of the people I ran into were nice. A few were obnoxious. But you can really tell the places that are easily accessible to the masses because of all the trash and often times graffiti. It's sad really. Hiking down from Bake Oven Knob got super, butt sliding rocky again. I have deemed one section there as ""Little Knife's Edge"". Louise, my trekking pole, literally saved my ass on Little Knife's Edge. I was teetering along the precarious traverse, and I lost my balance!! As I was falling back into the jumble of sharply angled rock slabs (fortunately I wasn't falling the other way into nothingness!) Louise was wedged between a couple of rocks and slowed my crash. My butt landed on a protruding slab corner. It was quite uncomfortable and rather painful, but not nearly as bad as it would have been had Louise not slowed my fall. As I'm sitting on this sharp rock corner trying to figure out the least painful way of dealing with this situation I look over and Louise is bent over like a bow, still holding me up. I managed to free myself and release some of that potential energy in my trekking pole. She straightened back almost fully, but does have a noticible curve to her. I'm a little worried about how effective she will continue to be in such a state, and I highly doubt I will be able to collapse her again. Maybe I can bend out the bow. At that point I was done with the rocks and just ready to get to the shelter!When I arrived at the shelter Sojo and Pirate were here alone with a couple of people just stopping in. Two guys came up the blue blaze and said they had gone at least .8 down the ridge and never did find the spring. I have been dreading this steep long climb down to get water. They gave up and pressed on. I was chatting with Pirate and he said a day hiker had just been in and confirmed it was a long, steep trail, but he came out with water. Pirate asked me how much water I needed to get to the next source. 2 liters. He motioned for my bottles and became my favorite person!!While he was getting water, a couple of LASHers finishing up the trail came in, Regina and Thomas. They stopped in to make dinner and decided to do without upping their water, but Pirate brought back a little extra that would get them through comfortably. In talking Regina and I learned that we were both members of the Appalachain Trail Women's Group on Facebook, so we took and posted a pic of the two of us. They headed out after dinner and it's just Pirate and I in the shelter tonight. I was going to hang, but there really isn't a good spot. There's not much tent space either, so I'm glad there's no crowd tonight. There are two other guys tenting with Sojo. The shelter is cool in that it is an original, so was constucted when or before the AT was completed in 1937. There's a great little clearing in from with a picnic table, fire pit, and bench. That's about all it has going for it... Small tent clearing, no hammock space, difficult water source, and no privy! But I plan to sleep well here tonight! A comment on the Guthook AT app informed us of a bear poking around about a month ago, so we have our bear bags hung, though I always hang mine.Tomorrow I will go on to the next shelter, then probably past it and try to get a room in town. I don't want to do the steep, bouldering climb out of Lehigh Gap at the end of the day. But we'll see how things go. The next shelter is supposed to be the last water source for about 20 miles. Will have to conserve. :-(","Allentown Hiking Club Shelter

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540932,"So I was pretty fed up after a couple of miles this morning. Pretty tired of dealing with the scrambles and going so slow over the rocks. Pretty tired of the trail because it was getting to me. I needed a break. I got in touch with the parents of a good friend of mine who were planning to pick me up in Wind Gap in a couple of days to see about the possibility of an early extraction! After some back and forth working out logistics, it was arranged that they would pick me up in Lehigh Gap at 5pm! I still had a few miles to go, but intentionally way over estimated how long it would take me since I didn't know what the terrain would be like, and I didn't want them to be waiting around for me. Besides, I don't mind waiting. I don't get bored!Not long after working all of that out I started to spot blueberries along the trail. I would pick a couple as the appeared here and there and pop them in my mouth. So sweet! Perfectly ripe! When I started to come across bigger patches of them I decided to pick some for Dave and Shirley. Guys, blueberry picking takes forever! And you can't gift just a few, that's weird... So I picked for about 45 minutes getting about a half litter. As I picked, Little Sister came along and was stoked to learn about the berries! She dropped her pack and started picking. Then Hey Girl came along, same thing. Eventually we had Pyro, Thin Mint, Tree, Pantry, and a few others all wandering through the brush picking berries, and there were plenty for everyone! I eventually had to press on because I now had an actual deadline and destination to keep in mind. The trail was really beautiful this afternoon. From the berry fields with amazing views to the mystical looking forests supported by low, soft, lush ferns! These ferny forests were pretty magical! Throughout the day as I would find myself in these areas I would stop and just take it in! Because there were hundreds of moths flitting about! I thought they were butterflies, but it was hard to distinguish because they would never lite on anything, just flit flit flit, here to there, kissing my cheek and my neck with their can't little wings. Eventually I spotted a couple on the trunk of a tree and got a photo. Maybe someone can tell me what they are.I stopped at a great flowing spring right on the trail just past the George W. Outerbridge shelter for water. I chugged a liter and bottled a liter. Then I put a few blueberries in the bottle with the ice cold spring water. What a nice treat that was!Made it down the last, rocky decent to wait for my ride. A few other guys that I had seen back and forth this afternoon came out not long after me. They were headed into town and were debating what kind of luck they would have hitchhiking. Eventually they decided to hire an Uber. What?!? You can Uber from the trail?? That just seems kind of lame to me, but to each his own! Hike your own hike!Dave and Shirley made it to pick me up, and I felt pretty bad stinking up their truck, especially since we were in there pretty close together!

She needed a couple of things, and I needed to resupply.After the store we stopped for lunch and split a cheese steak sandwich and onion rings. PA is know for their cheese steaks right? It had to be done. Then smear stopped by the AT in Wind Gap to scope it out. I pointed out the little stretch that went along the road and the white blazes and we chatted about how she could leave goodies for the hikers at the trail head there. It's kind of neat how subtle the AT can be. People drive past or along it all the time without realizing it!Back at the house I was getting ready to settle down with my Kindle when Dave out me on the gator to ""go for a drive"". I followed along behind him on the tractor out to one of their fields. He pointed to half of the field and told me to start digging holes, throw in som lime, fertilizer, water and pumpkin seeds then left me to it while he planted the other half with buckwheat! I was out there in my thin camp shoes and ""town clothes""! To be fair, I had offered to help several times, and I love this kind of work. I just wasn't expecting it when it happened! But it was a lot of fun. I miss getting out and working the land. After the field was planted I drove around exploring the property for a bit before going in to shower.For dinner we had steamed muscles and clams with potatoes, fresh corn, watermelon, and all kinds of awesomeness!

A package I had been waiting for arrived with my new set of guidebook pages and a new, smaller pair of shorts (I've lost about 30 pounds since starting the trail). Dave was headed into work, and Shirley left to get a workout in. I lounged about being lazy and ready pretty much all day. This afternoon Shirley went to the nursing home to help out with some events, so I continues to lounge and read. This evening we all headed out to a local state park where Shirley and I went on a monthly guided hike. It was lovely, though I'm glad I get to do most of my hiking alone these days. I can only listen to teenagers talk about Grey's Anatomy for so long...After the hike we went out for Chinese then headed back to the house to settle in for the evening. I'm on the back porch now watching the fireflies. They are awesome here. They stick to the trees, but go all the way up to the tree tops, and are much more frenetic than the fireflies I've been seeing in the trail. They blink fast and often, resembling blinking Christmas lights in the trees. Beautiful!

Ran into a couple of townies at a road crossing about a half mile from the shelter. They were carrying their coolers and oversized sleeping bags with plans to hike a gravel road to the shelter. I was a bit weary, but Flannel and Stardust had said they were staying at the shelter as well, so I wasn't worried. Back on the strain I met Blade and Bad Apple. They were at the shelter when I got there which was nice because apparently Flannel and Stardust had decided to hike on. They hung out long enough for me to be comfortable with the Townies, Jim and Dave. These guys were obviously planning a late night, so I set up my hammock, then went back down to the shelter to hang out. They shared a couple of beers with the promise to pack out the cans.

I passed a large family day hiking and spent some time chatting with them.Some great views of the Delaware River coming down into Delaware Water Gap, but I was so ready to be done! My last day hiking in PA!!! So excited to put these rocks behind me!! I got caught in a bit of a deluge for a while. It was a short storm, but enough to get me pretty soaked. The gear is dry though! I finally made it into DWG and the Church of the Mountain Hiker Hostel. This place is pretty great. Bunkhouse, high pressure shower, shelter in the back, lots of renting room. I got permission to hang my hammock under the deck, and it ended up being a pretty good spot!After getting set up and taking a shower, I visited Massage Bob who comes out on Thursdays to do free massages for the hikers. It was amazing! The Church of the Mountain also does a big hiker feed on Thursdays. The hitch members all being dishes, and they were celebrating the 40th anniversary of the hostel. They must have fed about 40 hikers! The Crow is here with me tonight, haven't seen him in a few days. In fact, most of the hikers that I have seen the last couple of days are here... Flannel and Stardust, Firestarter, Blade and Bade Apple, Wanderer, Tree, The Sheppard, and lots of new folks too. We ended up having to do some optimization under the deck to fit four hammocks as Fern, Daddy Long Legs, and Scorpion needed a place to hang as well. We all got a good giggle when scorpion's knot failed and she landed flat out on the ground. Fern helped her get it secure after that. Lots of time this evening spent hanging out, playing the guitar, etc around the hostel, then we headed to the Deer Head Inn next door to get some drinks and listen to some jazz.

Back to the hostel for a while where people continued to show up. I had already claimed my spot in the 8 person bunkhouse. I chatted with the area ridge runner, Kevin, and his opinion is that the rocks are mostly over in about 6 miles (we are a .3 mile road walk from NJ!). You get so much conflicting info. Some say the rocks end just a few miles into NJ, some say 40 miles in, and I've also hear 80 miles in. We'll see!More hanging out followed by a trip for pizza and beer, then to a local bar.

The rocks have followed me from PA!!!After a not to early breakfast at the Deer Head Inn, I dawdled around the hostel packing up my stuff. I finally set out at 11 knowing I would be in PA in .3 miles!! I-80 took me across the Delaware River and into my next state!Not far into NJ I stapled at one of the visitor centers for Dleaware Water Gap National Recreation Area to get my passport stamped, then continued on the tackle my 1000ft climb to start the day. The climb was actually pretty nice over about 2.5 miles. Fairly easy, consistent grade as I hiked into the clouds.The fog was actually pretty cool. I'm sure Sunfish Pond is beautiful on a clear day, but not being able to see across it for the fog was really beat. It Kent an ethereal, mystical quality to the view. Still lots of rocks though. I know I passed what would have been some amazing views because that's what the guidebook tells me. Oh well, I enjoyed the look of this section in the clouds.So the rocks. Still. I knew they would extend into NJ a little ways, but I've been looking forward to getting to this state to get my joy back!! There wasn't a whole lot of joy on most of the trail today. However, with a few miles left to go I started singing out loud to myself, and this really helped the whole experience. I need to keep that up in the future if I'm not listening to proper music.I finally got to the Mohican Outdoor Center run by the Apoalachian Mountain Club (AMC), and decided to get a bunk. I was quite damp from walking through the cloud, and storms were in the forecast. I also got a club sandwich, chips and a coke.The Crow was here and was in the same bunkhouse as I am. I was told that if another female hiker came through she might be put in the room with me. Each of the rooms sleep 2-3 people. The hot shower was amazing, and it was great to enjoy the storm from the cover of the back porch or the coziness of the bunkhouse! As it got later I was sure they wouldn't be putting anyone else in the room with me. Good thing too because I have my stuff spread all over the teeny tiny room to dry and the room definitely smells!Also in the bunkhouse tonight we have thru hikers Sign Post, Blue Turtle, and Limey, as well as a French woman not much younger than myself and a couple with their 3-4 year old son.

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541680,"Breakfast took a while. There were only two options at the outdoor center, one being an egg, bacon, and cheese sandwich, but they were out of eggs and bacon... The Crow and I both had the pancake breakfast with sausage subbed for the bacon and sausage subbed for the eggs... :-/Took at least 45 minutes for our food to come out, but I enjoyed it when it did. I was already packed before I left my room, so while Crow packed I stayed in the dining room with Meli who was having her breakfast. She's a pretty neat chick, and it was a Georgia's day. I was so tempted to stay another night and spend the day at the outdoor center reading, swimming in the lake, eating real food, etc. But Crow had other plans.When I got back to the bunk house he was bugging me to leave. Seems he decided that we were going to take a blue blaze trail that paralleled the AT for about three miles before meeting back up with it. This was a little weird, we've never hiked together, we've just ended up at several shelters together. We get along great, so it wasn't a problem, but still weird. It didn't take me long to figure out what was going on... The Crow has a very real fear of bear. NJ is very known for their dense bear population. He was using me!!!We finally set off about 1130 down the road, but the track we were walking let to a swimming beach on the lake. A sign!!! Crow wasn't having it. I tried to convince him that we should hang around for the day and enjoy the lake, but no, all these hikers want to hike. We ended up having to bushwhack to the trail. He didn't really believe that I knew where we were going until we got there. To be fair, it did take a while tracking our way through Rattlesnake Swamp, but what's an adventure without a little adventuring?!?The trail we took, Rattlesnake Trail, was actually very nice, and not too many rocks! We made good time the first few miles with me in the lead. At one point I surprised a little garder snake in the trail, and it surprised me right back! We both (the snake and I) jumped about a foot in the air with a scream. Well, I'm sure it was doing the snake equivalent of screaming. Crow got a big kick out of that.It was a pretty nice trail today. Still rocky, but not nearly as bad or as constant. This afternoon we had some weather come in on us and rushed to put up my rain fly to sit under and wait it out. It ended up only sprinkling for a few seconds, but the atmosphere sure felt like it wanted to do more. It was a nice break nonetheless, and gave me a chance to eat lunch which I had not bothered to do when we stopped at the previous spring.It's nice hiking with someone. We chat, we sing, we are silent. It helps me keep up my hike because I don't feel like I can take all my little, unnecessary stand up breaks where I stop and ask myself again ""Why am I doing this?""Some nice views today, but after the first 10 miles my feet were aching pretty good. We stopped at a campsite to assess. We considered camping there as we were another four miles to the shelter. The site was on a blue blaze to Buttermilk falls, the highest waterfall in NJ. Would have been cool to check out, but the campsite was hardly off the AT and the falls was another two miles down the blue blaze. Easy call, we weren't hiking 4 miles for that!Some kids came up during our break and reported a bear cub about a half mile down the blue blaze. I looked at Crow and told him we would find another place for him to camp. So we continued another 1.3 miles to a site near a small, low stream. We were joined by Uncle Spider, Reptar, Single Sally, Limey, and eventually Tree who had taken a couple of days to go to a Phish concert in MA. Hey Girl and her hiking partner as well as Herstory passed by heading for the next shelter.

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541887,"Every serious undertaking needs a three pronged attack. Thus, I have devised such a strategy to get myself back into this hike!!1) Music. I need to listen to music. I might go a day without every now and then, but extended stretches leave me trapped too much in my head. Several weeks back my headphone adaptor for my life proof case stopped working, and thinking a waterproof phone more important than tunes, I would usually go without music. If I did play it (out loud, rather quietly), I had no convenient way to control it without the headphones, so I was mostly stuck with whatever was playing. Well, yesterday in a conversation with a fellow thru hiker, I discovered that my headphones would work without the adaptor! It's just not fully waterproof while they are plugged in, no biggy. I have thousands of songs on my phone, many I have never really listened to. Many that I love, but never think to listen to. Now fully back in control I can shuffle my whole library and skip over the those that I am not into. Yay!2) Food. I have a bad habit of not eating on the trail. I'm damn good at eating in town though! Often times I would have a couple spoonfuls of Nutela for breakfast, then nothing until a dinner of pepperoni and crackers. Maybe a granola bar or a pack of fruit snacks thrown in. Despite not really wanting to eat, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that this practice has probably contributed to me feeling pretty beat down. So from now on I will make it a point to eat more.3) Caffinated water enhancer. I enjoy most of the spring water out here. It tastes good. Even the water I collected today that was full of Tannins tasted fine to me. But, most people out here use some type of water enhancer. I'm not sure how much of a difference this might make, but it could possibly be subtle but very important. So I'll try to use the stuff more often.With the three pronged approach initiated today, I had a great hike. The trail did its part by providing some great views, and what I would consider a resonable distribution of rocks that didn't destroy my feet! The plantar fasciitis that I was pretty sure I was developing didn't even bother me until maybe the last mile, and that wasn't really bad. I didn't see any thru hikers today between breaking camp this morning (9am) and getting settled into the shelter tonight (6pm). Must be between bubbles. I didn't get eaten by a bear last night stealth camping solo in NJ (know for its high bear population), so that was good. Had lunch at a fire tower that would have marked 300 miles if I hadn't skipped that 20 mile section in PA (that I plan to go back for), and the view from the top was amazing. FaceTimed my dear friend Michele from the top to rub it in while she was at work. :-)Also hit the summit of Sunrise Mountain today which had some great views all around. I spent a good bit of time relaxing there and catching up with a couple of other people via FaceTime. Was strange how deserted it was up there since there was a parking lot just .1 miles from the stone pavilion I was hanging out in. I did run into a couple of people in the parking lot (where I took advantage of the garbage bins and the pit toilets) though.The Mashipacong Shelter is pretty cool. Pretty old too. But it's set on a nice little clearing, has a bear box for our food, and has the best smelling privy I've experienced so far!! There is no water source here, the next one being another six miles north, but trail angels stock the bear box with water! It gets depleted quickly depending on how many hikers are coming through, but I noticed a new comment this morning in the Guthook app saying they had left 15 gallons. There were still about 8 when I got here. I had collected and carried four liters from the last source several miles back, but it's got a lot of tannins in it (check out the photo). Most people would dump that and refill with the bottled water, but what I have is potable, and every liter I don't take is a liter available to a thirsty hiker, so I only took one liter. I am in the shelter tonight with Line Cook, a section hiker. We are talking about him picking me up about 100 miles north of here and letting me shower and stow my stuff at his place song can go into NYC for a day or two unencumbered. Sweet! We'll see what works out with that. I figure I should see the city being so close.Wander is hanging in his hammock across the clearing, and four other hikers who didn't have much to say to us are camped just in the woods.

I went to sleep at 10:30 last night, then woke up at 12:30am (and noted someone setting up a tent in front of the shelter) and didn't get back to sleep properly. I tried deep breathing, listening to a book on tape, listening to my ""go to sleep album"", taking clothes out of my clothes sack to adjust my ""pillow"". Nothing worked. Eventually I must have drifted off about 4, and I woke at around 5:30-6. Caffeine has never really had a noticeable effect on me, so I'll have to play around and see if that was the issue, or if it was something else.When I woke, Line Cook was making breakfast for me!! Oatmeal with powdered milk, pecans, pumpkin seeds, dried apricots and peaches, and all kinds of goodness! I set a new record by leaving camp at 7:30, I had big plans for the day and was excited to get to High Point State Park where they hikers get a free coke from the park HQ and there's a lake with a beach and a concession with an extensive menu!When I got to the park head quarters I ran into several hikers including Little Bear, she was the one setting her tent up at 12:30 this morning after a 27 mile day! I got my free coke and chatted with her about the beach, concessions, and free showers available. All of that was still down the trail just a bit, but we decided to take a more direct route via the road. We found Wander sitting on the beach when we got there, and I headed in for food while she headed in for a shower. After a rather gluttonous lunch I went for a swim fully clothed. Laundry and a bath at the same time!! The three of us ended up hanging out there for a couple of hours before heading to the next shelter.I thought a more direct route along the side of the lake made more sense than backtracking down the road to catch the state park trail to the AT. The others were up for the adventure, so we headed off. It was quite the scramble in a couple of places, but it was a fun little side trip. Back on the AT we parted (baced on our respective paces) with plans to see Wander at the shelter and well wishes for Little Bear who was aiming for another 15 miles. About two miles down the trail I ran into Little Bear sitting along the side digging into her food bag. We chatted for a while, and she debated stopping with us at the next shelter. She has a really tight deadline because of school. We talked about where the shelter was, as it's not listed in the AWOL guidebook, then parted ways again.The rest of the hike was quite pleasant - easy trail, very brief shower, lovely pasture land. .2 miles from the shelter I came upon, once again, Little Bear and Wander hanging by a lovely beaver pond. He was chilling with his uke and she was waiting for me to make sure she found the shelter. We ended up spending a little while hanging there before hitting the last bit to the shelter.The Jim Murray Shelter is also called the Hidden Shelter because it is not an ""official"" ATC shelter, and as such is not in any of the official guides. Jim is a former thru hiker, and he has been letting hikers use this little, enclosed shelter on his property for twenty years. There's potable well water, a hot shower, a privy, charging outlets. And it's really quite beautiful. We made friends with the two donkeys when we walked up. One other hiker, John the Baptist, was there, and we started getting settled in.Jim had a note telling us not to have pizza delivered to his farm, so we were trying to figure out other creative ways of getting some good grub! We realized town was less that two miles away. We also discovered that there was a pizza place and a tavern with burgers and such. The wheels were really turning now! We tried uber, we looked up cabs, we though about calling Jim and asking for a shuttle. John the Baptist mentioned free camping in the Village Cebter park. That pretty much did it, Wander was already putting his socks back on! While we repairs everything Wildchild showed up after a long 24 mile day. She opted to stay at the shelter as did John the Baptist. We opted to walk the road into town. About the same distance, but likely fewer rocks. Hiking in, we crossed over into NY! We actually crossed over between the trail and the shelter but didn't notice. Once in town we set up camp. Lots of hikers here tonight. I ended up having to tie up the swings so I could hang on the swing set. Once we were set we headed to the tavern. Where we arrived just in time for the kitchen to close!!! The others had a couple of beers, I was happy with coke, then we went back down to the pizza place, Annabelle's, that was right across from the park. I am not hanging from the swing set with a single piece of left over pizza in the pizza box on the ground beneath me (having just eaten the second to last slice a moment ago while reading this) and expecting maybe a little bit of rain tonight. Though every time I check the weather the chances are decreasing and times being pushed back. I just want to stay sufficiently dry! But I'm exhausted! I could probably sleep through anything tonight!

When we got there we discussed and decided to get a couple of rooms at the Stony Point Center, a nearby multicultural community and retreat. One of there volunteers, Amira, was at bear mountain when we were dropped off, so we scheduled our shuttle and headed into the zoo.The Appalachian Trail goes directly through the Bear Mountain Zoo, and the lowest elevation on the trail is at the bear encloser.

I have never in my life been that dirty I think, and that's really saying something! After my shower I headed in to the dinning hall for lunch, then spend the rest of the day relaxing and reading. It was pretty great.","Stony Point Center

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542772,"I was dropped back off at the trail mid morning and set out on my way across the Hudson. Then right into a 450 foot climb basically straight up. The first few miles was definitely a trudge, I was not feeling it! I was headed to Graymoor and expected to get there before the forecasted storms at 6. The hike was uneventful and uninspiring for most of the day.A little before 3 I ran into Herstory and a friend of hers who was doing a section with her, Juno. The atmosphere seemed to be changing so I checked the weather again and they had bumped the storm time up to 3:15! We were still about two miles out, so they made tracks while I stopped to put my pack cover on. I was going to end up hiking in the rain either way, so I wasn't in much of a rush.  It started as the storms tend to do, with big heavy raindrops. Then the wind started with through horizontally. I was on top of the Ridgeline and decided just to push through, though I was trying to keep a close eye on what was going on around me. As the rain streaked and blurred my vision and trees started snapping in half around me I made the call to head off trail to take shelter behind some rocks. I found somewhere to hunker down like a turtle if I needed to and watched the storm. It looked like the susceptible trees nearby had already succumb, so I though it fairly safe. Keeping an eye on my weather app, which kindly told me several times that lightening had been detected 0 miles from my position, I soaked in the rain. After the worst had passed, I returned to the trail. Within the next tenth of a mile I came across three large blow downs blacking the trail. I think I made the right decision stopping to seek out shelter, it would have sucked to have been under one of those heaps of branches, leaves, and knarled trunks! I slogged through the river of a trail, completely soaked with my boots full of water off the ridgeline and down the hill to a road crossing where I reached the Appalachian Market. I chatted with John the Baptist, Shades and her group, and Herstory and Juno. After wringing out my socks and a dinner of egg salad sandwich, chips, and a coke, I hiked the last mile to Graymoor. I have my hammock set up in the backfield pavilion. There are several hikers here. We have five hammocks in the pavilion, a couple of people on the ground, and a couple of picnic tables, as well as a few tents in the field. This is a pretty neat place. Very peaceful, save for a few hikers who are harmless, though rather obnoxious. The porta potties are clean, and there's a water spigot. I continue to be impressed with the towns and communities that take hikers in.","Bear Mountain Zoo

Spice,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542854,"Wonderful, uneventful day. Some of the folks that I camped with last night were planning to head to what was to be my next destination, and I kind of wanted to distance myself from them, so I decided to stay at this lovely, peaceful place for the day. Besides, Junko was getting off trail today, so that gave me a chance to spend some time with her and Herstory.We ordered pizza for lunch, and I spent the day reading. Several new folks here tonight, including Uncle Spider and Reptar, Pineapple Express, and Good Talk. There was just one other person in the pavilion tonight, but I decided last minute that it was a great night and a great place to cowboy camp under the stars! So, I'm in my sleeping bag out in the middle of the baseball field enjoying the stars before the full moon crests the treetops and drowns them out. Come to think of it, there's s good chance the moon might keep me up!! But I can snuggle into my sleeping bag to block the light, or I can just go back to the pavilion where my hammock still hangs. :-)","Graymoor Spiritual Life Center
