Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544120,"Plans have been made for my 2016 trek on the AT. I will be hopefully hiking from the NOC (where I got off the trail at the end of last years section hike) through Great Smoky Mountain National Park all the way to Davenport Gap. I will be hiking again with Blister. We hit the trail at the end of October and are hoping to have good views and weather. I have been jogging and walking a lot again to get a little fitness going prior to the hike. Some changes I am going to try (maybe a mistake due to GSMNP camping regulations) will be using a hammock on this trip. That will be new for me.   I am hoping to have the shelters fill up in the park so I can hang near the shelters. If not, I will have my thermarest to sleep on in the shelter.This trip should be around 100 miles. I am counting down the days until I get to head to the ATL to hike on the AT again!TURK",,Plans Made...Countdown Begins!,"Jul 30, Sat",0
Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549836,"I have jumped the last hurdle (other than the hike itself) for my 2016 AT section hike going from the NOC to Standing Bear Farm at the end of the Smokies.Having been through the registration process in the west for back country permits at places like Yosemite and Grand Canyon, I was a bit concerned about getting my shelter permits for the Smokies. When you watch youtube videos of thru hikers, etc., it is not a big deal because they get thru hiker permits for the Smokies, essentially allowing them to stay at any shelter they want. If you are not a thru hiker, it is not so liberal. When you make your permit reservations, you have to select a specific shelter for specific nights. That requires guessing how far you can hike without ever seeing the terrain. I made my best guesses using AWOL's guide book and plan on making it through the Smokies in 6 nights. I hope I picked the right terrain for short days and longer days, but at this point it doesn't matter, because I have no choice but to stick with my selections. I stayed up until midnight of the 30th day before my first day in the Smokies to get on the website and register. I wanted to make sure I got a permit and as luck would have it, I was successful. I have been taking one or two day hikes on the weekends to get my hiking muscles firing again. I have carried my 2 year old a couple times for weight, which in all honesty, will weigh more than all my backpacking gear to include food and water. That is some good training for the muscles.I have received all of my food in the mail (mainly dinners) consisting of some Wise Emergency Preparation meals (cheap Mountain house basically) and some Mountain house meals. I will be adding some protein to the Wise meals via some tuna packets. I will have to pack and send a resupply box to the Fontana Lodge, and probably will do so within a week of leaving. I have been weighing out my gear and have been making adjustments. My mother made me a silnylon rain kilt which I will replace my rain pants with. I have not decided whether to take my Marmot rain coat or stick with another Frogg Togg rain top. My old one ripped during my last trip, but honestly, it lasted for several trips so I am considering replacing it since it is so light and cheap. I will be using a new ULA Circuit pack in lieu of my Catalyst. I want to try that out since it is a little lighter. I am contemplating some other luxury items, but have yet to pull the trigger on bringing them or not. I try to make something lighter, or not use it before adding another luxury item. This keeps my base weight around 19 lbs for the most part.I will probably do one updated gear list with my final items and weights if anyone is interested in the game ""What's in my Pack."" Well, I have been counting down the days until I leave and can not wait to be back on the AT. It is really a shame that I live so far from that wonderful trail and can only hike on it once or twice a year.I will probably post one more prep journal from the NOC to let you know if I had any snags in my travel plans. Until then, Happy Hiking.",,Lining the Ducks in a Row,"Sep 29, Thu",0
Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550728,"So far, in all of the miles of backpacking that I have done, I have experienced many things, to include scorching temperature, bad mosquitoes, high humidity, cold, wet and cold and wet. Through all of it, I rarely have had to hike without the basic essentials, food, shelter and water.That being said, it appears this trip will add a new wrinkle in my hiking; lack of water. I have hiked out of the Grand Canyon with 5 liters of water, knowing there was no water on the way out, or from Red's Meadow to Deer Creek (I think it is Deer or Duck creek prior to Purple Lake) without water, but that was for one day, knowing there was water at the end of the day. What I have not done, however is had to hike for two solid days without water, to include camping, eating, and climbing over 3500 feet. The beginning of the Smokey's is not supposed to have any water until Derek Knob shelter.I am hoping the rains they are supposed to get today will replenish the ground water somehow. As suggested I will try to find water a little further down the hill than the listed springs, however, I have to balance the likelihood of finding water with the energy and water wasted in sweat looking for it.Wish me luck and pray for rain in the Smokeys. I fly out Saturday! Through hell or low water, I will be on the AT pretty soon.",,Here's a new wrinkle,"Oct 20, Thu",0
Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551274,"10/22:  Going from ""civilization"" to life on the trail can be a shock to ones daily routines.  Today I woke up from my cozy bed, did he usual morning routines, got a ride to the airport, kissed my wife and baby goodbye and headed to Atlanta.  Blister picked me up, we stopped briefly at his house, and headed north to the Nantahala Outdoor Center aka the NOC.On the way, we stopped by an REI so Blister could pick up an additional water container so we would each have the capacity to carry 6 liters.  Why would we need that much capacity you ask?  Well, it turns out the Smokeys were in a drought, of the likes have not been seen for 50 years.  Anyway, back to easing from civilization to trail life, we arrived at the NOC at around 9:30 pm.  I looked in a wooden box near the general store's door, and sure enough, there was an envelope with my name on it and directions to our room on the ""campus"" map.  Our room was listed as Tsali 3amd we drove the car up the hill to the rooms.  We walked to the room wondering if there was a bathroom inside.  As we opened the door to Tsali 3, we started laughing out loud. The room was very modest to say the least.  It had two bunks on top of each other with a 2x4 crafted ladder.  There was a mirror, a bench, some hooks on the wall and a few outlets.  It also had a heater/air conditioning unit.   Under normal circumstances, this would get around a half star review in hotels.com.  Under a hiker's view, however, this room had everything one could need.We went up to the common area which was a dining hall with a few picnic tables and a kitchen that had all the pots and pans and utensils that anyone would need.    The bathroom was more like a locker room with showers, toilets and sinks.  I was impressed that it was actually really clean.We retired to Tsali 3 around 10:30 pm and layer on our prison issue like mattresses using our own sleeping bags to sleep in.  The big adventure for 2016 was about to start in the morning.  Since Blister is over 6 feet tall, for some reason we had him take the top bunk.  Let's just say if he had a nightmare and sat straight up, he could quite possibly be concussed by the ceiling of Tsali 3.   The rustic nature of this room was like the ""missing link"" between civilization and trail life.  It was was the perfect way to gradually turn from Joe Schmo to hiker trash..",,Tranform to a hiker,"Oct 22, Sat",0
Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551275,"10/23 Day 1:  I awoke after a not so great night's sleep.  I will be honest, after dropping into the NOC a year ago, I was not looking forward to the grueling climb that awaited us.  We ate in the common area, taking full advantage of the teapot and gas stove to heat our water.  Oh the conveniences of civilization.Once we were packed up and enjoyed the last flush toilet in our near futures, we walked over to the bridge that crosses the river at the NOC, took a picture at the white blaze that was painted on the tree where last year's section hike ended.  We entered the woods across the railroad tracks and suddenly Todd and Kenny were transformed into Blister and Turk.We started at 1749 feet of elevation and just started climbing and climbing.  While my pack only had 3 days of food in it, it was feeling heavy as I was once again trying to get my muscles and tendons used to the stresses of trail hiking and backpacking life.  As we climbed higher and higher, taking frequent breaks to catch our breath, we crossed paths with a few overnight hikers who relayed basically that there were a few puddles of water along the way, but no springs were flowing.  After a couple miles in, we took a break with our packs off.  We had climbed to 2990 feet by this point and has built up a good lather.  I could see water vapor evaporating off of my back looking like the steam that comes off an NFL players head on a cold day on the sideline.  After our break, we continued climbing and took another break at the Jump Up which is around 3805 feet.  We met a nice lady from the area and a cool gentleman from Texas.  I got some rally nice photographs of the gorge and all that was below, where we once were.  After pictures and some information exchanges about water and bears that were seen recently, we climbed around another 500 feet and decided to eat some lunch on a log.  Following lunch, we crossed 4400 feet at Swim Bald and then dropped into Sassafras Gap shelter.  At the shelter we saw how bad the water situation really was.  We had to use my titanium snow peak cup to scoop water from a puddle spring in order to get a couple liters of water to carry.  Following getting water, we continued to climb towards Cheoa Bald.  Somewhere up a steep section, Blister got a thigh cramp that would not release.  We stood there for around 5 minutes waiting for his leg muscle to finally let go.  We finally got to Cheoa Bald, which stands at a whopping 5062 feet, and took lots of photographs, and a break. At the end of the day, we did a long steep descent to a camping area located at mile 147.6 called Locust Cove Gap.  This was sitting at 3690 feet.  For the day, we climbed 3623 feet and dropped 1682 feet.Once we got to the gap, we had around an hour of daylight left to get set up, find water, hang our food, and eat, etc.  I searched pretty far down the hill for water and came up with nothing.  The water shortage situation was starting to get serious.  We had a couple liters left for dinner, breakfast and to hike to the next water source on the next day.  We were in conservation mode to say the least.  We set up our hammocks, and had a pretty good laugh as we both tried to throw Blister's rock bag over a branch that looked 30 feet in the air.  I am pretty sure there were approximately 20 unsuccessful attempts.   Hiker midnight had arrived and we were off to slumber.","NOC

Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551276,"10/24 Day 2:  We started the day with minimal water and the next water source was around five miles away.  Normally, I like to drink a liter of water throughout the night to recover from the day's previous sweat loss.  This was not an option on this night as water was becoming gold out here.   I misplaced my tent stakes in the morning and had to take 20 minutes retracing my steps until I finally found them hiding under the bag I keep my chargers and spare batteries in.  Err.  We finally got packed up and were on our way.  We hiked up and down various hills knowing full well that Jacob's Ladder would be on our agenda today.  Unfortunately, the water source we were attempting to get to was actually after the ladder.  For those who don't know, Jacob's Ladder is a pretty stout climb of 600 feet in 6/10ths of a mile. The cold spell from the last couple of days had left and it was starting to get a bit warm in the woods.As we dropped into Stecoah Gap, I noticed on AWOL’s guide that there was a hostel/B&B near the gap. I thought, perhaps when we get there, if it isn’t too far, the caretakers wouldn’t mind letting us fill up our water. Generally near road crossings, there are wooden signs on the trail giving you distances to various trails and shelters. As I was reading the sign just prior to Stecoah gap, Blister said, “Look at that.” I looked down and saw the wonderful sight of two cans of cold ginger ale that had been left by some kind hearted soul. They were propped against the sign. Ahhhh-Trail Magic! Happy enough over that, as I walked down the final steps towards the gap, I saw two gallons of water sitting on a picnic table with no names on them. I was sure someone knew the water situation out here was bad and kindly put them there for our use. Whoever did that, I say thank you, thank you, thank you. We filled up and got ready to move forward after a couple phone calls and a small break. While sitting there, we met “Durham” who was thru-hiking with his dog and slack packing from Fontana Dam to the NOC…in one day. Oh to be young. We also met a Joshua who was section hiking before going to EMT school. He had been a Hot Shot forest fire fighter in New Mexico in the recent past.We hiked on and the trail got pretty steep. I wasn’t sure if we were on Jacob’s ladder or not, only because I didn’t know how far we hiked, not because it was not difficult. It was a challenging climb, but at 6/10ths of a mile it was over pretty quickly. I think the climb up Albert Mountain was steeper, but also much shorter.After the ladder, weight to Brown Fork Gap Shelter for some rest and lunch. I walked down to the water source and (drumroll please)…you guessed it. It was dry. Had we not received that trail magic, we honestly would have been really having issues.Following lunch, we came across a freshly blazed blue blaze trail around 1/4 mile north of Brown Fork Gap shelter. Joshua told us he walked down that trail and was able to get water. It was good to know that at least all the water was not dry. The afternoon was filled with some nice trail walking with a gradual down hill towards Yellow Creek Mountain road. Near the bottom of the hill we hit an oasis in this desert; Yellow Creek Gap Stream. It was flowing nicely across the trail and we took the opportunity to fill up all of our water containers in case Cable Gap Shelter was dry. We finally got into Cable Gap shelter with around an hour left of daylight left. As luck would have it, there was a small seep of water coming out of the ground. We put the hammocks up above the shelter on some flatter ground, ate while perched on the porch of the shelter, and seriously contemplated what we were going to do regarding the Smokys. I really had reservations on whether or not we should continue. Blister had the same reservations. I told Blister we would check the map for side trails out of the Smokys in case we were stuck for a couple days with no water.Shortly after turning in for the night, we heard this loud, large, heavy aircraft seem to be flying just above tree line on the ridge to our south. When it went by, it was so loud, I started counting in my head waiting for the “boom” of a crash. When nothing happened, I thought perhaps it was just a military training operation. The plane went by another time around an hour later.","Locust Cove Gap

Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551277,"10/25 Day 3: We got packed up and were happy we had a short day to Fontana Lodge planned, where we had shipped our resupply boxes. After a “good morning” 800 foot climb out of Cable Gap Shelter, we did a fair amount of ridge walking and started to see Fontana Lake in the distance. As we descended, the trail got pretty steep with lots of rock steps. I did not envy the people who were going south that had to climb up this hill. Also as we walked, we saw and smelled a lot of smoke in the air. There was a haze that almost obstructed our view of the Smoky mountains across the lake. We came to find out later that there was a small forest fire near Ashville, NC and the wind had blown the smoke into this bowl of Fontana Lake. Also, somewhere coming down the hill, I realized we actually had to walk almost a couple extra miles to get to the Dam Visitor Center in lieu of the marina because we already had a 12 mile day going up into the Smokys set up for the next day and didn’t want to add 2 miles to that.When I got to the marina, I picked up the phone that is hooked to the wall of the first building to the right of the trail and dialed “0” like it said on the sign to reach the front desk. I asked about the shuttle and to my surprise, the lady on the other end said she would try to get us a shuttle, but they can’t guarantee it. Uh oh, I thought, with no shuttle, we might have to walk an additional 1.5 miles to the lodge on top of the other “addition” that day. The walk to the Dam Visitor center was on some wonderfully groomed trails. We got there in no time. I kind of regret not stopping in to see the Fontana Hilton, but we had things to do at the lodge with limited time. We made it to the visitor center and the volunteers called the lodge for us. My fears of no ride were subsided when the volunteer told me they would be here in 10 minutes to get us. Phew. Outside the visitor center, an Asian lady was talking with Blister and asked if she could lift his pack to see how heavy. When she tried, she started saying in a thick Asian accent, “Oh nooooo, way to heavy…” We all had a chuckle at that.The Fontana Lodge was nice, but probably a little pricey for a hiker, although they did have a walk up rate that was better. We got our resupply boxes and I immediately started paring down what I was going to bring. With all the water we were going to have to carry, there was no way I was going to carry this much food weight as well, not to mention, I think I really overpacked food anyway. I took out a bunch of trail mix (I forgot that I got sick of that pretty fast), tuna packets, and a few other items, making my next 7 days of food probably weigh 12 pounds. We next walked down the hill to the laundry mat, threw some clothes in and went to eat a giant super pork sandwich at the grill restaurant located on the property. Once back at our laundry, we started talking to a guy who was thru-hiking with his pit bull. Apparently, the dog had gotten a lot of poison ivy at a caretakers house that it had to stay at while this kid was hiking the Smokys, because they don’t allow dogs in the National Park.We bought a few items at the general store. The store was stocked sufficiently to get a hiker through the Smokys, and even though it was priced a little higher ($6.25 for a box of Triscuits), considering what it cost me to send my food box there, it might have been the smarter option. I will certainly consider that in the future, but this late in the hiking season, you never know what will still be stocked and open.The evening ended in a soft and comfy bed watching a few innings of the World Series.","Cable Gap Shelter

Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551278,"10/26 Day 4: Our shuttle ride that was supposed to be set up for 7:30 am was a no show. We needed to get onto the trail as soon as possible because it was going to take us a long time to get to Mollies Ridge Shelter. After filling up 6 liters of water each, and adding the 7 days of food, our packs were outrageously heavy. Blister’s had to be 50 pounds and mine had to be 44 pounds. That is 14 pounds more than I generally have to carry following a resupply.I asked a maintenance man if he would mind giving us a ride to the dam for $20 and he obliged. We stopped by the post office on the way and put all of our extra food into the hiker box located inside. Blister forgot his block of cheese in the refrigerator at the hotel.We got dropped off at the dam and the height of the Smokys hit us right in the face. You could see the fire tower at Shuckstack which loomed 2100 feet above us and 4.4 trail miles away. We crossed the dam and got some cool photos and then continued on a road walk, totaling almost a mile. We took the obligatory pictures at the Welcome to the Smokys sign, and finally entered the woods. So far, the climb into the Smokys was not as bad as the climb out of the NOC. We just slowly and methodically just kept putting one foot in front of the other and went up up up. There weren’t much for landmarks to gauge our progress so we just kept at it. The walk seemed to climb a bit over a shelf, skirt the shelf with a couple switch backs, only to reach another shelf to do it all over again. We finally reached a boulder jumble that looked like a throne. This put us 1.4 miles from Shuckstack fire tower. The trail started to flatten out a little bit, but still climbing. Just prior to the fire tower it really got steep, but only for a short period. There were some very nice views from a rock shelf that had to have been blasted or chipped out of the way to make room for the trail, kind of like what they do when building a freeway.We finally got the the fire tower and were happy to rest and eat lunch. I climbed up into the fire tower and got some amazing views of the lake, the dam and the mountains to come. The leaves were much more full of color than the section from the NOC to the dam. The fire tower was a bit rickety and really wobbled while I climbed it. While eating lunch, we met a local lady who decided to take a day hike with her AirBnB guest, Pierre, a guy from France. She corrected me by telling me the locals call the NOC the “En Oh See” when I was calling it the NOC “knock.” Pierre was a skinny guy who was hiking a lot of miles fast. I believe he was possibly going all the way Spence Field Shelter. Blister and I laughed later that he sounded like Sasha Baron Cohen’s french character in the movie Talladega Nights, “I will get you Wicky Bubby.” They left before we did from the fire tower and I got to say, “Au revoir Pierre.”Following lunch, and a nice rest, our afternoon consisted of mostly climbing, but and a few drops as well. We crossed paths with “Handmade” who had a unique homemade backpack that looked like it had sawed off wooden oars for supports. Apparently he was some Harvard kid who was out living life on the trail for a while. He had hiked from Harpers Ferry to Katahdin, turned around, and was going to hike to Springer and then back to Harpers Ferry, essentially doing the trail twice in one year. Amazing, especially hiking in jeans and Chaco sandals. On the way past the side trail for Birch Spring Gap tenting area, we saw a “Beware of Active Bears” kind of sign that we agreed was just put there to scare hikers into hanging their food properly. Hiking on, the top of the long climbs finally came upon us at Doe Knob, at around 4580 feet. We had climbed 2880 feet by this point over almost 8 miles. Around this point, we entered Tennessee for the first time, with much less fanfare than the GA/NC sign at the last state crossing. As a matter of fact, no sign existed at all. The only reason we knew we were in Tennessee was because AWOL’s guide indicated that. We dropped to Ekaneetlee Gap, where we were told there was water. Again, not knowing how far down the mountain the water picks up made going to look for it not a risk we wanted to take. I still had 4 liters to get me through the first night, and we were told there was water at Russell Field Shelter which would only be around 3 miles the next morning form Mollies Ridge.We started the climb up to Mollies Ridge shelter and were so happy to see it when we finally got there. This was a long hard day of climbing with heavy packs. We set up our spots in the shelter not knowing if anyone else was going to be there. While eating dinner, a heavier guy in his early twenties stopped by for a few minutes and related a story to us that he had been throwing up all day as he climbed out of the dam because he thinks he had a bad biscuit at McDonalds. I was very glad he was not staying in our shelter. The last thing I wanted was to get a virus or stomach ailment with 6 more days of hiking. For the day, we climbed 3,610 feet and dropped 708 feet.Hiker midnight was upon us and we climbed into our racks to go deep in slumber for the evening…around 8 pm. Around 11 pm, I saw a headlamp enter our shelter and what appeared to be a girl with a large mass of dreadlocks on top of her head set up her sleeping pad on the lower deck and went out and hung her food bag. I thought perhaps she was a thru hiker who was using all her waking hours to hike. More on my misperceptions in the morning.","Fontana Lodge (Dam Visitor Center)

Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551279,"10/27 Day 5: I did not get a good night’s sleep in the shelter. It just seems whenever I get comfortable, an arm falls asleep or something like that. I am probably just spoiled with too many pillows at home, almost making a gorilla nest to sleep in. Anyway, I guess what I saw the night before with the girl coming in late was not reality. Contrary to a fully dreadlocked thru hiker that I thought I saw, was a young short haired clean cut female section hiker named Crock Pot. Perceptions isn’t always reality. She told us what happened to her and why she came to the shelter so late. Remember the “Active Bear” sign we had seen at Birch Spring Gap? Well apparently, there were actually active bears there. She told a story about a bear sticking its nose in her tent. She said she blew her whistle so loud they were both deaf. She noticed the bear was not leaving and saw its eyes out in the dark. It got close again and she sprayed it with bear pepper spray. At that point, she decided to pack up and head north to our shelter…in her pajamas. That was a crazy story. I bet she was glad to see other hikers in the shelter when she got there.We bid Crock Pot adieu, and got a late start on our hike towards Derek Knob. Shortly into our day, after climbing over Devils Tater Patch, the skies opened up and we got a pretty good rain. We donned all of our rain gear, and I was kind of excited because I got to try out my new rain kilt that my mother had sewn for me. It worked great. I had lots of ventilation and no restrictions of movement. Maybe 20 minutes after it had started raining, we crossed paths with the kid who had been throwing up all day yesterday. I asked if he was feeling better. He replied with a grin, said he was not feeling better and proceeded to tell us he threw up all over Russell Field Shelter. That was where we were supposed to get water. We were told that all the shelters from this point on had water, so we decided not to risk stopping at Russel Field. Who knew if he threw up near the water puddle or not. On the way to Spence Field shelter, I saw 3 wild turkeys eating something on the trail and they scattered down the side of the hill as we approached. The Smokys were living up to their name as we were walking a lot in the fog, even though the rain had stopped. We ate lunch at Spence Field shelter and I went down the hill to look for water. When I came back empty handed, Blister had a huge look of disappointment. We were told there was water 1/2 mile down past the shelter on Eagle Creek trail, but there were two paths and we couldn’t tell which one was the trail. We were told time and time again that there was a good flow of water at Derek Knob shelter, which was our destination for the day, so rather than dropping a few hundred feet in elevation on what potentially was a wild goose chase, we decided to trudge on. I had 10 ounces of water left to go the next six miles. What looked on AWOL’s guide like a nice ridge walk with minimal elevation gain or loss from Spence Field to Derek’s Knob couldn’t have been further from the truth. There were some extremely steep, however short, hills as the trail decided to start going straight over the summits of mountains, in lieu of skirting them. There were some very pretty views, but each time we reached one summit, you could see the bald of the next summit in front of you, with a large drop in between. We finally got over the summit of Thunderhead Mountain at 5527 feet. With all the ups and downs that followed, and limited signage on the trail, I thought we were almost done for the day, when in actuality, we had a couple more big climbs ahead of us. I mistook Starkey Gap for Sugar Tree Gap. I was literally taking a small swig of water every mile, just to conserve what I had left. The last 1.1 mile was of course all up hill and relatively steep. I was very glad to see Derek Knob shelter. Earlier in the day I ran into a hike who was preparing for a 2017 thru hike and he said the spring at Derek Knob was flowing 2 liters per minute. I kept saying that in my head as I make the last 1.1 mile climb, “2 liters a minute, 2 liters a minute…” I finally made it to a full shelter and after saying hello, asked where the water was. I filled up my water at this beautifully flowing spring, filtered it and drank a liter in 30 seconds. After both getting water, we joined the people at the shelter and had some nice conversations about their thru-hikes. Towards the end of dinner, 3 guys who did not look unlike Native Americans arrived at the shelter. One started smoking and I thought I caught the whiff of booze. They were more dressed like hunters than hikers. I went and said hello and they told me they got dropped off at Clingmans Dome earlier in the day and they were hiking to Fontana Dam. I picked my spot against the wall of the lower deck of the shelter. Blister was originally next to me, but decided to hang his hammock outside since the shelter was full. Boy do I wish I made the same decision. Our permits said we have to stay in the shelters, but we had yet to see any ridge runner or ranger or anything related to anyone in authority.This turned out to be my worst night in a shelter…period…ever. The three late inebriated arrivers had their lantern placed on the end of the table that consequently shined right in on my head as I lay there trying to go to sleep. Around 9:30 pm, I got up to take a whiz and asked them if they could move the lantern to the left because it was lighting up the whole shelter. They said no problem and moved it. Maybe a couple hours later, they decided they were going to sleep in the shelter. One guy was kind of moaning a bit and the guy next to me was rolling all around trying to get comfortable. Mind you, this shelter was full and there was little room to be tossing and turning. An undetermined amount of time later, I feel this drunk guy roll up on me, like literally half on top of my body. Instinctually, I took both arms and pushed him off of me. He then started moaning again, tossing around and then I started to hear, “huck ptoooey,” “huuuuuck ptoooey.” One of these three was clearing his throat and actually spitting inside the shelter, over and over again. One time after the “tooey,” and I may have imagined this, but I felt something hit me in the back of my sleeping bag. I reached my hand back there to feel if I had been spit on, but it is hard to tell cold from wet when it is cold out. I was horrified/angry all at once. A couple more fend offs of the guy putting his head on my sleeping bag had done it for me. At 2:30 am, I grabbed all my stuff and set my hammock up outside near Blister. The two other people on the bottom bunks, two thru-hikers, decided to just get up and start hiking. It was that awful. In the morning, no one was left on that deck of the shelter other than the three drunk guys. I was polite to them in the morning, but inside I was disgusted by them. I never could find any sign of “ptooey"" on my bag, but I would almost rather not know.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551280,"10/28 Day 6: I was starting to have doubts this morning about the way I set up our trip through the Smokeys. Not being thru-hikers, we had to reserve spots at specific shelters. I set up for longer days at the beginning of the Smokeys, thinking that even though our bags would be heavier with food, we would be much fresher physically. This was done way in advance of knowing what the water situation was. After yesterday’s waterless walk to Derek Knob, Blister felt like he was somehow holding me up and started to contemplate finding a way to hike out and catch up to me. It was the usual mental ups and downs of a hike playing games in our heads, so recognizing this, we tried to say some things to lift our spirits a little; kind of fake it until you make it stuff. On this day for me, I had to goal of hitting 200 miles on the southern AT, we had the prospect of hitting the highest point on the AT, and we kept saying, well, our packs are getting lighter and lighter.Starting out in the morning, it was clear my legs were still feeling tired from the previous days steep ups and downs. We reached Silers Bald shelter mid morning and stopped for a pack break and a snack. We had to cover so many miles each day, we were really not stopping very frequently and taking the packs off to rest. Normally this coincides with getting water for me on a routine AT trek, however, obviously this was not happening on this trip. At Silers Bald, Blister talked to his wife on the phone and it appeared his spirits were much improved and all the talk about finding an exit had vanished like our morning snacks. After a short break, we continued to climb up towards Double Spring Gap Shelter, where we ate lunch…and low and behold, there was a trickle of water on the North Carolina side. It was slow and probably took me 15 minutes to fill 3 liters, but it was water!It was around this shelter that we started running into quite a few overnight hikers and day hikers who had started out at Clingmans Dome. Following lunch, we started the long climb towards the apex of the AT, elevation wise. We noticed the forest started changing a bit as we were hitting a section of nice pine trees. The climb towards Clingmans was very gradual up until we got to Mt. Buckley. Here the trail got quite steep and seemed to go on and on. There were some very beautiful views from Mt. Buckley, so the climbing did indeed have a payoff. Eventually, I could see the man-made ramp and lookout that sits atop Clingmans Dome. I knew we were close.We made it to a paved path and took that to the lookout at Clingmans Dome and were met by legions of people. They came from all walks of life…and they all drove there. While were were really lucky to have a clear day weather wise atop the tower, we didn’t get much of a clear day on the tower to look around and take photographs. I was hoping my hiker stench would move some people away, but considering the lands that some of these people had come from (I did watch Slumdog Millionaire), I probably smelled normal.After taking our turn on the perch, we sat at the bottom for a snack like museum pieces with people buzzing all around us. A very nice volunteer ranger seemed to take a liking to us, probably because he was more of a back country guy who only put up with the masses of people in order to protect this spot. He talked about Charlie’s Bunyon being one of his favorite places. I was also eager to see that as well. He gave us a 32 oz. Gatorade to split and took our trash for us. He was a true kind gentleman.   From the looks of the sun in the sky and knowing the miles we had left to go, we decided to start hiking on again. We made sure to put our headlamps somewhere handy, because it looked like at our pace, darkness was going to beat us to the shelter.We dropped the steep descent down the north side of Clingmans Dome, losing 891 feet while getting to Collins Gap. The trail and the road to the dome paralleled each other most of the way down. Halfway down the hill, I hit the 200 mile mark for the southern AT. There was no sign, but AWOL’s guide assured me of that. The sun set just after crossing Collins Gap and I knew we were going to be night hiking soon.The woods grew dark and a little eerie. I had never night hiked before, so this would be a first for me. As we reached the top, I kept thinking somehow we missed the sign for the Sugarland Mountain Trail which would bring us the half mile to Mt. Collins Shelter. I was getting frustrated, but soon realized on my guide book, there was a bit of a descent prior to reaching the trail. Man were the woods dark. There was no moon to speak of and we were walking through a fresh pine forest with thousands of arm width trees in massive groves. I periodically would wake a bird up that was perched just above the trail and would jump when it would fly off fast making noise in the quiet woods.At long last, after around an hour of night hiking, we reached the sign and then hiked the half mile to Mt. Collins. The shelter was full with many through hikers and some section hikers, so we were able to set up our hammocks in a beautifully soft pine needle carpeted floor. We did the usual at night, eating, conversing with the new hikers we met, hung our packs and food, and went off to sleep.This day seemed to be the turning point for our trip in terms of difficulty. Our packs got lighter, water became more available, and the difficulty of the climbs became a bit easier as our bodies got used to the physical challenges. We paid it forward, so to speak, by getting some big mile days out of the way so we could have some shorter days at the end. Including the half mile side trail to get to Mt. Collins Shelter, we did a total of 14.3 miles today and climbed around 2300 feet.","Derek Knob Shelter

Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551281,"10/29 Day 7: This was the 1 week on the trail mark! We took our time getting out of camp, knowing we had a relatively short day to Icewater Springs Shelter. We got water in the morning at the spring near the shelter which was flowing like a faucet. Yay! It was a really nice easy walk down hill most of the way towards Newfound Gap. It was a lot easier to converse going down hill than up hill. Midway down towards the gap, we ran across Bright Side. He started in Maine with his granddaughter and continued on after she quit following the 100 mile wilderness. He laughed and said he didn't even ask his wife. Later we came across two guys hiking to Mt. Collins Shelter. One guy appeared to be really struggling with a heavy pack and a heavier belly. I hope he made it.We got to a parking area at Road Prong Trail and took off our packs for a snack. We had cell reception, so I attempted to call my wife who was vacationing with my daughter at my sisters house. I was unsuccessful so I left a message. I was able to get in touch with my mother who promised to pass them a message that we were doing fine. I am a purist when it comes to hitting every white blaze on the AT, but not so much when it comes to not using any modern conveniences. I like to keep in touch with my loved ones, to share my experience, and just to get a touch of home.We climbed up over Mingus Ridge and crossed some anti-wild hog barriers. I had heard from the ranger on the dome that wild hogs can be a problem near Mt. Collins shelter, but I never saw any signs of them. At lunch we crossed into Newfound Gap and ran into what can only be described as a Disneyland like parking lot. Cars were lined up waiting to get spots and people were everywhere. We decided to sit on the wall for lunch. Again, we were like museum pieces that people would walk past and stare at. Parking was apparently such a commodity that two guys in their late sixties nearly had a fist fight over a spot. It was comical. We met “Kid” at the gap who was doing trail magic for through hikers. He asked if we came across “Pretty Boy” who was supposed to be in the Smokeys, but we hadn't yet. Following lunch, I got a photo at the gap sign that was the Tennessee/North Carolina border marker. Truth be told, I think we were walking on the border for much of our hike in the Smokeys already. We made the steady afternoon climb out of Newfound Gap towards our destination of Icewater Springs Shelter. We literally had to stop every 25 feet to step aside for day hikers coming down the trail. I guess many of them hiked the 4 miles to Charlie’s Bunyon and were now returning.The day had gotten warm, and when we arrived at the shelter, we had plenty of sunshine left to hang out our hiking clothes to dry. This shelter was also like a museum piece because it was the only shelter on the way to Charlies Bunyon and it was right on the trail. People would stop by to see what a shelter looked like and then move on. Unfortunately for me, one group of those people happened to stop by when I was inside changing out of my hiking clothes. I thought perhaps Blister would tell them I was inside, but to no avail. I was fortunately back to them as they walked by the gap in the tarp and peering in. I used my standard bathroom quote when someone comes a knocking, “Uh Occupied.” Oh well, that was embarrassing, but they soon left.There were some boys from a fraternity from Samford University in Alabama that were resting on the grass at the shelter. Later, we saw some guys we had spent the night near at Mt. Collins Shelter. They knew each other from being on the same dragon boat team in NC. I guess a dragon boat is like an oversized canoe and they race each other. To give you an idea of the diversity on the trail, our other shelter mates for the night were these two Phd research scientists from Tulane University who happened to be on the front lines of the ebola outbreak in Sierra Leon last year. One night spitting drunken people, one night medical geniuses. You never know who you will run into. We did a fair amount of stargazing after being rewarded with a beautiful sunset. One of the researchers sons, Cal, had never seen the sky so full of stars. His dad said there was so much light pollution in New Orleans that they never get to see the sky like this. That is sad. We pondered the universe a bit, to include talking about how some of the stars that we were looking at might not even be around anymore since it took the light so long to get to Earth. They were very nice people to talk to and I was glad to have met them.We got into our hammocks for the night after a shorter hiking day and looked forward to the next. For the record, there was a beautiful spring that crossed the trail 75 feet from the shelter that was flowing like a champ. Good times in the northern end of the Smokeys.","Mt. Collins Shelter

Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551282,"10/30 Day 8: Our goal for the day was to do another short day to Peck’s Corner Shelter. We broke camp and had a very easy walk towards Charlies Bunyon. We almost had the Bunyon to ourselves. It was great. The views were quite impressive under almost clear skies. You could see for miles. What was equally amazing was how the trail was perched on a cliff that, had you slipped and fallen, would certainly have ended your life. The sign says watch your children and that really can’t be understated. After some photos and video, we moved on. We got to Dry Sluice Trail in which the sign said 4.2 miles to Peck Corner Shelter. Somewhere along the way, we got confirmation that Pecks was dry with no water. This damaged our spirits a bit. We had such good luck with water the last couple days, we were not looking forward to another dry night. We were conserving our water on the way to Pecks and I was having the argument in my head over and over…do we stay at Pecks or move on to Tri-Corner Knob shelter where we knew there was water? Short day vs. a longer day. Well, by the time we got to the 1/2 mile trail that leads to Pecks, I was really dejected. It seemed to take forever to cover the 4.2 miles from that last sign. I had never really pulled out my AWOL guide, but apparently the signs was a bit off. We actually covered 6 miles since the sign, and 7.4 miles for the day, all by lunch. Knowing that, we sat down and made the decision to eat lunch, drink our water normally, and push on to Tri-Corner Knob shelter. The afternoon was filled with beautiful views from the sides of the mountains we were climbing. It seemed in the northern Smokeys the trails skirted the mountaintops in lieu of going over the top of them like further south.Dusk was upon us when we arrived at the shelter, but we felt we really made the right decision. While we had three pretty good afternoon climbs, we were able to stay well hydrated and knew there was water at the end. When we got to the shelter we met Red Cap and Lumberjack. Red Cap was a free spirit who worked in computer graphics and travelled all around the world, working when she needed to as a free lance to make money. She was a LASH’er (Long Ass Section Hiker) who started north and was doing around 500 miles. Lumberjack was a funny dude who had opinions about many of the other thru hikers we came across. Both seemed like really cool people. Blister fixed the spring pipe and we all had flowing water to fill our needs. Hiker midnight once again came and I went deep in slumber in my hammock that was perched on a hillside. When I say deep in slumber, I can’t really say I mean “deep.” I was still trying to perfect the hammock thing and actually was not getting great sleep. I was working on it, however.","Icewater Springs Shelter

Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551283,"10/31 Day 9: Happy Halloween! Since I was wearing a bright yellow shirt I was going to be Pikachu. Blister was wearing an orange shirt, so we agreed he was dressed as a road cone.    We awoke around 7:30 which is when the first light starts to brighten the dark woods. We had some nice breakfast conversation with Red Cap and Lumberjack. Lumberjack decided to pack out some other people’s trash that was left in the fireplace. Who leaves their trash? Honestly? Anyway, he needed a trash bag so I gave him a ziplock that had a Snickers in it. He was like, “You know there is a snickers in here, don’t you? I said yes, and happy halloween. With through hiker hunger, he was probably very happy to have that snickers.It was a pretty uneventful day hiking towards Cosby Knob shelter. We passed a lot of mossy covered forest and some good springs on the trail. Most of the day was a downhill walk losing much of the elevation we had gained during the first half of the trip. While coming down the hill, we passed remnants of the old plane crash site. Apparently in 1984 an F4 military plane crashed there which is what we thought because some of the metal was painted green.We got to the shelter pretty early in the day which gave us time to find a good spot to hang, wash up a bit, eat, and just relax. I went through my food bag and set up my stuff for the next day, to even include my water. Later in the evening a thru hiker named “Profit” (he said he was the real profit) came into the shelter area. I gave him all the water information which he took notes on. He then set up his tent and never really came around us again. He was nice, but I guess just looking to be alone. He did have some strong opinions on some other thru-hikers we had met, almost getting mad that they were calling themselves thru-hikes because of all the “yellow blazing and hotel rooms they had been staying in.” He seemed a little bitter about that but then ended it up with “well, hike your own hike I guess.” That is the trail equivalent of a saying that I use in daily life when I can’t explain peoples actions and I don’t want it to wear on me. I use what my mother always says, “Everybody is different.” A short time later, a young 21 year old kid named Johnathan who was from Pennsylvania showed up. He was a bit of a free spirit too, preferring to hike about in lieu of finishing his marketing degree. We had some nice conversation. He asked me if I smoked to which I replied no. As we went into our hammocks for the night, I think Johnathan and Prophet were toking up some herb over at Prophet’s camp site. They seemed to stay up way later than most hikers who had just climbed 3000 feet.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551284,"11/1 Day 10: Our last day was upon us. We had a longer hike than the two previous days to get to Standing Bear Farm hostel, but our packs were light and water was aplenty.   We dropped in elevation a ways in the morning and then made our last significant climb in the Smokeys, passing Mt. Cammerer Trail. For the rest of the day we were walking down down down down. Step after step we were losing elevation and gaining temperature. After almost dropping 2500 feet, we decided to take a break and eat lunch at Davenport Gap Shelter. I was able to talk to my wife on the phone and was very happy to hear her voice. The shelter had good water and we topped off a liter and headed further down the mountain. I was a little disappointed at the lack of signage/fanfare at the northern end of the Smokeys. There is a metal box for thru hikers to deposit their permits, and a road crossing, but nothing else. After realizing we had reached the northern boundary of the Smokeys, I fist bumped Blister and proclaimed we were Great Smoky Mountains thru-hikers! Ta daaaaa!We continued on up and down some hills and eventually passed a giant power line. You could hear all the traffic on I-40 that was getting close. The trail followed a stream down the mountain until we reached the Pigean River Bridge. Blister said, where was all this water a few days ago?? We crossed the bridge on a road walk and went under our first interstate, I-40. It was hard to believe I could hitch a ride with a trucker and be in Flagstaff, AZ in a couple days. Following the road walk, we were met by 36 straight up stone stairs that thrust us back into the woods up a steep hillside. The climb to Green Corner Road was the last kick in the pants that the AT wanted to give us, just to be sure not to forget her.At last, we reached mile 241.3, Green Corner Road. The AT miles for my 2016 hike had been completed. All in all, we did 104 AT miles on this trip. We walked up the road towards Standing Bear Farm and were greeted by a rustic looking set of buildings. When we entered the driveway, there was a gray haired skinny gentleman with a long ZZ Top kind of beard sitting in a rocking chair smoking a cigarette. He said, “What can I do for you?” I asked if we could spend the night and he proceeded to tell us the skinny about the place, bunk house, tent area, etc. I asked if there were any trees to hang our hammocks (I didn’t want to stay in the bunk house since this was my last time camping out for a while). He showed us some trees on the side of a hill in the driveway. In all honesty, there was really only one set of good trees for a hammock and I insisted Blister take those. I figured I would make do. We set up our camps and walked back to the main area of the hostel. The gentleman who greeted us was named Clark. He showed us where the shower was, the pantry where you could buy food and drinks, the fire pit area, the kitchen and the washer and electric dryer. I decided to take a shower, but of course there were no towels. The shower, under normal life circumstances would have been foul, however after 7 days without a shower, it’ll do donkey, it’ll do. One wall of the shower was made of empty beer bottles cemented in place to make a semi cement glass wall. I closed the moldy curtain to the shower and a praying mantis flew down to the bottom of the shower. Don’t get me wrong, I am wholly glad I stayed there to experience this unique place. As much as you have to embrace the suck on the AT at times, you have to also embrace the muck. I reached up high on a wooden shelf and found a motel sized bar of soap to scrub myself. The water turned from hot to cold several times, and was flowing out of a shower head that was placed in an old rusty metal pipe in the ceiling of the shower. Honestly, a shower never felt so good. There were no towels, and I forgot my drying cloth in my bag, so I had to dry off with my old sweaty wool undershirt! Yay! I got my night clothes on and did feel much cleaner. While Blister took a shower, I got a pack of chips from the pantry and Clark got me a $2 Pabst Blue Ribbon. I was in heaven. The cool thing about this place is you take an envelope, write everything you take out of the pantry on it with the price, and just settle up in the morning. They even take credit cards. When Blister was done, he came over to the common area and had Clark get him a Digiornio pizza. That looked so good, I got one as well. There were three thru hikers staying there and I shared my pizza with Stumbledwarf, Mojo and Pringles, who had just finished her through hike. Stumbledwarf was a very jovial Englishman who had raised nearly 10,000 pounds, donating 6,000 pounds towards the British Heart Foundation. Grizzly, another thru hiker showed up later in the evening. There was an odd couple from Ohio also staying at the hostel. This one lanky red haired guy was walking around in bare feet and wearing hiking pants. He bounced around like he was full of nervous energy. He and his girlfriend would take turns massaging each others backs as they sat around conversing. This wasn’t the usual massage on the traps, rather a full up and down the back, elbows and knuckles digging in massage. I nicknamed him the gargoyle because he never fully sat down. He would perch his feet up on the rock and crouch down like a frog like gargoyle. He was an odd ball for sure. I almost burst out laughing when his girlfriend was asking the thru-hikers questions while sounding like she was in a helicopter because the gargoyle had gotten to the karate chop on the back part of her massage. Following watching Mojo struggle to make a fire, something you would think he may have mastered over the last 6 months (although through hikers probably rarely have time for a fire) I went off to my hammock to get some sleep. My body was sore from 10 straight days of hiking and I needed to relax. Unfortunately for me, the trees from which I hung my hammock were far too close. I was shaped like a “V” trying to get comfortable all night to no avail. I think eating the Digiorno pizza and a whole sleeve of lays stackers so soon after eating trail food also took its toll on my stomach. I was fighting off having to get out of my hammock to hurl. I was afraid I had somehow come down with novo-virus. My ill feeling finally subsided and I think I got a couple hours of sleep.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Turk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551285,"11/2 Post Hike Day 1: Sometime around 6 am, I heard a rooster crowing at the hostel. It was still a couple hours from daylight, so I am not sure why he started so early. Eventually I heard people starting to stir and I walked over to the common area. I gave Grizzly my last summer sausage stick that he ate on the spot. One by one, we saw the hikers depart to continue on with their hikes. Stumbledwarf was going to catch a ride into Gatlinburg to take care of some visa issues he was having so he could finish his hike. We settled up our tabs with Clark and talked politics around the morning non burning fire pit. Around 9:30 am, our ride Ronnie McGaha arrived and we said goodbye to anyone that was left. As Ronnie drove us, he told us about the various parts of the country he has visited, hiked in and some of the volunteer work he had done in the Smokys. It was very clear that he cared deeply for this trail and the park. We took his business card for future use and he took a photo of us once we reached the NOC. All that was left was for us to travel via Blister’s car to Atlanta. We ate lunch at the NOC, hit the road and made it back to Atlanta mid afternoon. All in all, while this trip was tough due to water conditions, it was another successful trip on the Appalachian Trail. I thought the Smokeys were beautiful. We didn’t see a bear, but saw lots of squirrels, chipmunks, deer, birds and wild turkeys. Hopefully I will be back on the AT sometime in the future. I would love to get my wife into backpacking, but those chances are between slim and none. Happy hiking to everyone and thanks for reading my wordy journal.—Turk",,Its Over Johnny,"Nov 07, Mon",0
