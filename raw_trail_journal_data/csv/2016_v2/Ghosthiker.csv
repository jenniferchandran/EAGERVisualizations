Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538504,"Well then......I have decided to finish what I started! I have been asked, why? since I will not attain the distinguished ""thru hike"" status. Simple answer, to finish! Hope you are with me on my journey!Heading to Maine on Monday, June 20th and will start my hike where I left off in Caratunk on June 25th. Sooooooo excited! More to come soon.","

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539964,"What a morning! We drove pulling the trailer from Bar Harbor to Caratunk. Barely made it to be the very last person across the river at 5 minutes before 11 am. The ATC provides ferry service from 9 to 11 only before July 15th. Dave and Tessa saw me off. Poor Tessa (my dog) really wanted to come with me. Today's terrain wasn't too bad but it was kind of a long day due to the extreme heat. Met a couple hiking who live in Maine and they told me there is a drought here. Ugh. Coolest moment of the day was hearing a moose jumping out of a pond and catching a quick glimpse of it going up the hill! It was HUGE. It was a good day and I arrived at the shelter and set up my tent about 6:30 pm. A huge group of campers, 10 teenage girls, are hiking up to Katahdin. They were noisy but by 8:30 all was so quiet. The couple from Maine arrived, he goes by Bacon, his wife Kris does not have a trail name yet. Hoping for good sleep. Tomorrow is Little Bigelow mountain.","Caratunk, Maine

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539968,"Hot, hot, hot!!! Today was crazy hot! Am I in Maine? I got to East Flagstaff lake at 10 am and went skinny dipping! Amazing. Found a very private rocky cliff all to myself. I hiked on and got to Little Bigelow Lean-to at noon just soaked in sweat. Went over to ""the tubs"" and cleaned up and made lunch. Made the mistake of going barefoot and got sap all over my feet. Took forever to get it off. Met a man and 2 women day hiking and visited too long. Hiked on and got up to Little Bigelow Mountain. The heat took its toll on me. This little mountain was tough. Met Pace and his sister, Delightful, who started on March 4th. They must be so excited to be so near the finish. Also met Alpine Glow who is from Canada. Also a NOBO. Arrived at Safford Notch Camp at 5 pm. Found the water, ate dinner and crashed. Bacon and Kris came in at 7:30 looking hot and worn out too. Tomorrow has some big mountains. Sure hope it's cooler. Plan to get up early to beat the heat.","West Carry Pond Lean-to

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539969,"I was on the trail at 6 am. Nice morning so far. Stopped at Old Man Head for my first view today. It was spectacular. It was only 7:15 so the sun was still rising. Worth the 0.1 off trail. Avery peak was amazing. The breeze was so refreshing. So thankful for that. Also had some patchy cloud coverage! Running out of water I arrived at the spring just before Avery Memorial Campsite. The water, spring, stores up in a box. Must see my pics for this one. Again, thankful for my Guardian. It might be bulky but the extra pound is worth it. Oh, did I say my pack with all my food and water weighed in at 18 pounds! Continued on over Bigelow Mountain West peak and then the South Horn. There is a permanent residence, a tent under a canopy, up here. It belongs to the fire warden. There was a sweet view of the Horns Pond with a couple of small kayaks on it. I could see the people fishing. The terrain really changed as I got down the mountain. Lots of snakes. Stepped on one. Tons of little frogs. And lots of chipmunks and squirrels. When I arrived at the sign that said ME 27   0.9 miles I got so excited knowing Dave would be there. Why does it take soooooooo long to go 0.9 miles? It felt like forever. Right as I walked out on to the street the very first passerby asked if I needed a ride in to Stratton. Wow, that never happened last year. I guess it happens when you don't need it. Dave was sitting right there in the parking area! I sight for sore eyes, my very own Trail Angel.","Safford Notch Campsite

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540397,"Worst day of rain I have ever had on the trail. Things were going well before the storm hit. I saw Young Guns on the trail. He hiked the entire trail last year and was out for some sections. He works at Maine Huts and Trails. Others hiking NOBO were Tomahawk, Swiss Miss, Hairbear, Hoot and 38. Met them all before the major 2:30 pm storm hit. I sat up my tent a few feet off the trail just to get some cover. It wasn't just rain, it was a flash flood. The trail turned into a river and water came up under my tent. I got out, and quickly, with all my stuff still in the tent, found high ground. I was soaked but, hey, my boots were dry and everything in my pack was dry! Learned a lesson. I sat for about an hour and a half then hiked on. I had the most beautiful after storm views up there on Sugarloaf Mountain. You don't get the rainbow without the rain! God gave me my rainbow!","Stayed put

Lone Mountain 3260', Saddleback Junior 3655', The Horn 4032', and Saddleback 4120'. You don't just go up and walk a ridge, you go up and down all of them and they are rock scrambles at the top. The picture shows Saddleback from The Horn. You can see the trail up the mountain. It was spectacular. One of my absolutely favorites yet. So thankful the weather was so nice. Found a little stream just past Eddy Pond and set up my tent, totally wiped out.","Spaulding Mountain Lean-to

Hiked to the road and then to The Hiker Hut. This wasn't planned but I am just so tired. Steve brought 3 of us in to town and called The Farmhouse, no rooms. The town is full for 4th of July weekend. So we are all staying at the Hut.","Eddy Pond

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540687,"Wonderful breakfast by Katherine and Steve from the Hiker Hut! Wonderful place with a sweet outdoor shower. Said my goodbyes and got on the trail at 9 am. Sweet trail pretty much all day today. Didn't feel like Maine. Met many new hikers today. Taylor Swift who is doing Maine's 4000' peaks. Also met one of the Warrior Hikers, MamaGoose. She will finish this year and is getting ready for the CDT. Lots of tough hikers this year. I don't have my trail legs at all and feel tired a lot. It was a very, very windy day today and felt like rain was coming. I called Dave while on the highest peak today and asked if he would pick me up. He met me at ME 17. What an amazing view at this spot. Mooselookmeguntic Lake. So majestic. Wonderful day!","Rangeley

Met NOWA, no one walks alone. He is going north and will be finished soon. Also saw Heartattack again today. Met her a few shelters back. I know my destination shows South Arm but since I went north I ended at ME 17 again today. Dave picked me up and we went to camp and he grilled kielbasa tonight. Shower, washed clothes, and bed.

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540788,"I am a slack pack addict! This is the way to do the trail, I am convinced! Sweet, sweet, sweet! I hiked NOBO again. Went from East B Hill Rd to South Arm Rd. I saw several of the same SOBO hikers as yesterday. Had a nice conversation with Mr. Sunshine. Also saw Splash, Heartattack, Numbers and Bluegrass again. The first 5 or 6 miles went by so fast. Going the mile and a half down Hall Mountain wasn't too bad but the 1.1 mile up Moody Mountain was another story. I had a really hard time finding the trail. Then I saw the rebar! I knew I was still going the right way. It was hot today. Happy I had taken off my shirt and soaked it in the creek before that hike up. It was nice to see Dave waiting for me when I had to rock hop across the stream at the road. Went to the cute town of Bethel near our campground for a wonderful Independence Day dinner!","South Arm Rd

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541432,"Dave brought me back to East B Hill Rd this morning at 9:40 am. He hiked with me to Dunn Notch and Falls. It was such a pretty place. Grafton Notch State Park is very nice. Balpate is absolutely beautiful. One of my favorites on this hike yet. It was nice slack packing through this park. Dave met me at Grafton Notch at 3 pm with the rest of my gear and a pizza! I packed up my gear and left the notch at 4 pm. Not realizing Old Speck Mountain was such a beast.The elevation up on top is 4033'. Maybe it was harder because I had slacked the last 30 miles or so. Old Speck just kept going up and up. I got to the side trail to the tower about 6:30 pm and decided to take the short 0.3 to the tower. It was so worth it. Absolutely the most spectacular view. Guess what? My camera stopped working!!!!! Unbelievable!!!! So it is only in my head. I stayed up in the tower too long. It was the longest mile ever to Speck Pond Shelter. Very, very treacherous steep rocks almost all the way down. I did use my old phone to take some pics. So the quality of the pics from here to Gorham are not very good because of that fact but at least I got them. Arrived and paid the $10 to stay in the shelter. This is to offset the cost of all the work the AMC does to maintain several areas. It was worth it. Brandon was the caretaker here. He stays out here 10 days and then is off for 3. The pond is so beautiful and the shelter was so clean. Just a couple of section hikers in the shelter and a group of young men up the hill in tents. It was quiet. Well, a little snoring. I was so tired it didn't bother me much.","East B Hill Rd

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541435,"Left Speck Pond about 8 am and started my climb in the Mahoosuc Notch at 11 am. This area is talked about by every one. It is supposedly the most difficult mile on the AT. I disagree. It was hard, don't get me wrong, but not the most difficult. I really enjoyed it. The bottom of some of the cave areas had thick ice in them. The picture just does not do it justice. I loved how cool it was down in them. Air-conditioner! So nice. I had talked with a section hiker who was about 10 years older then me just before I started this part and she told me it took her 4 hours! Then I met Popeye and Olive Oil, cute names very befitting, who told me it was overrated and they did it in about 1 1/2 hours. So I timed it and it took me 1 hour and 40 minutes taking my time! I did take my pack off twice to crawl under some boulders. I am happy to be done with that area. I arrived at Full Goose Shelter at 2 pm or so and decided to continue on to the next shelter. Met Nana and her daughter, Big Red, who are hiking a section and thought I could easily get to the next shelter before dark. It was a little harder than I thought it was going to be. Several rocks and several peaks of Goose Eye Mountain. I think the Mahoosuc Notch made me a bit more tired than I want to admit. I arrived at Carlo Col Shelter at 7:40 pm. Captain America and Wee Gillis are two NOBO's here tonight. Also a section hiker, Strummy Stick, who is out in his tent. I am staying in the shelter because there just are no flat spots for my tent and the chance of rain.","Speck Pond Shelter

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541438,"That was the WORST night of sleep ever. I think I am going to get Noro Virus. I have never seen so many mice in a shelter. I didn't sleep at all with the mice running around. I would hit my head light at them and they would freeze like if they froze I wouldn't see them. UGH! Cute little disgusting critters. I was so hot at first I had my feet out of my bag but when they crawled on them I put them back in. Thumping little feet across the shelter floor ALL NIGHT LONG. I even had to sleep with my head covered up. Got up early and left since I couldn't sleep anyway. First mountain of the day, Mt. Success. What a name. First thing was the border sign!! Whoo hoo I am out of Maine! The first 5 miles or so to Gentian Pond were HARD. The next several miles were fairly nice. The weather took a turn and a storm was brewing hard and fast as I hiked up Wocket Ledge. Kind of scary sounding. I had to make a big decision when I got to the Trident Col campsite area since I was nearly out of food. I had 7 miles to go and didn't really want to sleep in my tent with rain looming. I decided to hoof it to Gorham. Up Cascade Mountain then down. Up Mt Hayes, then down. Long meandering through the woods. Then the long uncomfortable mile, half on the gravel road and then half on the paved road. Oh I was never so happy to see US 2. Happy my trail angel is still here since the White Mountains Hostel sign says ""No Vacancy"".That would have been a tough blow. Dave arrived at 7 or so. Camp is just a mile or so towards Gorham. He had burgers and hot dogs on the grill! SWEEEEEEET. A cold drink....you know what I mean....and then little pies he warmed on the grill topped with ice cream. It doesn't get any better than that!","Carlo Col Shelter

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541439,"I needed this zero day. I must say it is so wonderful having Dave and Tessa here on this part of the hike but you also have to deal with more issues. When Dave left me in the woods a few days ago Tessa had an ugly sore developing on her back. It might have been the size of a quarter or so in one spot and the size of a dime in another. Then when he picked me up last night it was huge with even more developing. We both thought she had mange. I found a vet 20 miles back in Maine who said bring her in now. Bethel Animal Hospital is the best Vet clinic I have ever taken Tessa to. To make the long story short, she is already healing. Amazing. It was the bite of the black fly. The bacteria spreads in dogs hair like wildfire. So anyway back to hiking. I have to say at this point I have not decided if I will go back on the trail yet. I am still just unbelievably tired. My knees are extremely sore. I will ride out the stormy weekend and make a decision soon. Will keep you posted.","Gorham, NH

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541941,"I decided to jump ahead to start today at Pinkham Notch so I would have beautiful weather going up to Mt. Washington tomorrow. I started at 10 am. It was a perfect weather day today. My first view was at Lowes Bald Spot where I got a great view of the Northern Presidential range that I would be hiking up. The Whites have so many trails throughout that you really have to pay attention to signs and the guide book. I had stopped to take a picture of the Peabody River and had turned around and noticed a footbridge. I continued hiking and stopped for a snack and read my guide again noticing I was suppose to hike over that footbridge. Good thing I happened to turn around to take that picture. I backtracked to the bridge and continued on. Once I passed Osgood tent site the terrain was mostly rocks all the way up and over Mt. Madison! It was so nice to see the hut come in to view from the top. Going down the rocks was just as treacherous. I got to the hut at 4:30 pm and asked if I could do work for stay. I may have been a little early but they were super nice. I had to sit outside in the cold waiting for all the paying quests to finish dinner and I got some delicious leftovers, beef strips, Mexican type rice, bread, spice cake and lemonade. A NOBO named T was also there for stay. After dinner we washed all the dishes and put them away. Then we waited until lights out at 9;30 pm and sat up a sleep space on the dining hall floor to try to get some sleep. Didn't happen. Too many folks walking around at night, stomping, to the bathroom and slamming the stall door. What a night.","Pinkham Notch

Ghosthiker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541945,"The crew started preparing breakfast around 4 am! I didn't stay for breakfast because I didn't want to wait around before hiking up to Mt. Washington. I left at 7 am and got to the summit at noon. It was ALL rocks. It was breathtaking though. Absolutely loved this trek even though I was totally wiped out when I got there. I found the summit sign and, unbelievably, there was a line to get a picture with it. So funny. The auto road and the cog train bring people up here all day long. It is a tourist trap. There are also lots of people that hike several of the routes up. Dave drove up here to meet me. We walked around the sites and went to the museum. Such a cool spot up here. There are signs that show this spot has recorded the worlds worst weather. While we were up at the Tip Top hut a lady fell face down on to the ragged rocks. Her face covered in blood. The medics ran up to help her. It was scary. She was hurt pretty badly. Now for the hard part here. I have decided to go home at this point. I find myself totally exhausted all the time. Not sure why I can't find my groove. Thank you for those who have been so awesome with the encouraging words. Thank you Truck! I am happy with my decision and Mt. Washington was a great one for my finale this year.","Madison spring Hut
