Chuck Reuben,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624584,"In 2016, my plans to return to the trail and complete what I started in 2015 was struck down with when I was dealt with unexpected health issue. As a result, my hiking was limited to just  96  miles. Funny, that was 20 miles more than last year. I got to get better at this! 
I hiked the 95 miles between Dicks Creek Gap in three different 3 day trips.  The first leg from Dicks Creek Gap to to Winding Stair Gap, 40.2 miles. An aquantance from home had introduced me to an individual that was interested in thru hiking the AT. I told him to come along with me on this short trip to get an idea of what he was thinking about doing. At the end of the trip, he was hooked. It was much more difficult than he had ever expected, but he was game to give it a go. He decided section hiking the AT might be a better idea and we discussed him joining me in 2017.   
The 109.4 miles posted above includes the 70.5 miles from 2015 and the 38.9 miles hiked on this trip. I have not figured out how to combine miles from different journal miles. I want to be able to show total miles hiked. thats just me","Dick's Creek Gap

Chuck Reuben,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624585,"Two weeks later, I went out for 2 hike day hike continuing my staggered journey from Winding Stair Gap to the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center.), 27.3 miles. It was a beautiful fall weekend with quite a few hikers out on the trail. I ran into a number of SOBO's who were near completion of their thru hike.","Winding Stair Gap

Chuck Reuben,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624586,"One more short 30 mile hike from the NOC to Fontana Dam ended my 2016 section hiking. Again, it was a beautiful fall weekend. The leaves were starting to change, SOBO's we getting closer to their ultimate goal and I was ready to get serious about finishing the AT. My plan was to section hike the remainder of the trail in 3-4 years. See you in the spring.","NOC
