Caribou And Dovetail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479963,"Dear Reader,It has been a quite a long time since my last journal entry. I think it has been well over a year. To catch you up on so much time would be difficult so here's a short little summary of hiking related events.I'll get the bad part out of the way. Last time I wrote I was busy with school and doing hikes. Since than the hikes have slowed down and my school work has continued. The cause of my lack of hiking is... well unknown. It seems that time has taken me away from something I love... Also adding to anti-hiking, Dovetail and I haven't hiked since our thru-hike. This has partly been my fault these past few months, but with no one to share a passion with, the fire of it can slowly fade... The last bit of bad is my foot is still a problem for me (I'll go into more detail than.).. There seems to be this downward spiral and I can't seem to pull my self out of this hole I have dug for myself. However, these past few weeks things have started to change and, now although the journey is a longer and more difficult than I've ever remembered, there seems to be light growing at the end of the tunnel.The good... I just set up my job for the summer of 2015. I will be able to work for two moths than leave in July to hike south. This was one of the most important parts to setting up my hike... My foot problem is finally diagnosed. It's quite complicated but to make it short, I have really really unflexable calf muscles which in turn means I have little movement and flexibility in my ankles. This means there is a lot of stress put on the balls of my feet, which makes them very sore and swollen. If you haven't read my previous journal this ended my hike in 2013 a 1600 miles short. This is good though because now I can prepare myself with the right training and footwear... Training is going well. I've kept myself in good shape since my last hike. I've been doing lots of running (when my foot can handle it), and have been getting into yoga. With less than a 180 days to go I'm kicking my training into high gear. This means six days a week I'm working out. Lately I've been doing lots of yoga and stretching for my foot problem. I usually get a run in and a strength building exercises. Two hours of my day go into training and I plan to continue becoming more intense as time passes... The last thing I want to talk about is my attitude. Any thru hiker knows that this is the biggest part of a hike. I can tell you mine has been bad at points but has only been getting better these past few months. There is a lot pushing me and lot I have to prove to some people in my life. And its not that I can thru hike. Its that I can make time to have a passion and a drive to do it. This hike is going to be about having an experience for me not about being a bad ass 2000 plus mile hiker (not that its a bad thing, any thru-hiker is a true bad ass haha). The goal is to finish the trail, but the purpose is way above and beyond that for me.Last few thoughts. I'm going to be all by myself hiking this time. No Dovetail there by my side. I can see both good and bad coming out of this. It's going to be lonely going south with no partner. I think most people couldn't handle it. I saw people finishing coming south while I went north in 2013. They had no one with them. They just had north bounders they ran into. It might be hard for me being more alone, but I do find a calmness and an openness to having less people around. I also have a feeling I'll make some awesome friends along the way. It just won't be as many as going north... My foot, I don't know how it will feel on this hike. It could go either way. That is why I'm looking more for the fun experience in this hike rather than the thru hike aspect. I'm going to soak up every moment of this hike and if means I only make it a hundred miles. Than fine I've still succeed as long as I have fun and learn a thing or two.Look for new journals to appear more frequently as the time gets closer and closer. I'm planning on July 1 as my starting date. I CANT WAIT!Caribou",,A little catch up on a lot of thinking,"Jan 08, Thu",0
Caribou And Dovetail,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502804,"Hello Kinfolk,Will its been a long time again since we've had a chat about thru hiking. I don't have a lot of time so I'm going to try and pack as much information as possible into a little amount of time...To start I will no longer be hiking southbound this summer. There are several reasons why. Most of these are personal and no interest to you (manly financial stuff and time issues). However, I'm very very happy to tell you about my biggest reason why. You may have read Caribou for the title of this log until today. Will take notice now!!! Yup Caribou and my brother Dovetail are hiking the trail again together!! This changes a lot folks.One, the hike is always better when you can do it with someone who loves to hike almost exactly the way you do. We're a team when it comes down to it. I think in 2013 we fell apart and it was a little bit of a blow to both of us. Now I'm not saying we need one another to do this, but hiking the trail is built on a lot of things including friendship. I think we held out some really tough nights of cold rain and snow because we had each others company and good spirits.Two, we have been talking a lot about the way were gonna hike. We're gonna be way more spontaneous... If you are going to ask us in the morning where we will end camping that night the answer will be a shrug of the shoulders. Last time I feel we would push ourselves to reach goals or be frustrated when we wouldn't. This time we will be listening to our bodies a lot more then listing to our not so smart brains haha.Three, our start time is not planned yet but I'm suspecting that it will be later than our 2013 hike. It was too cold, and I don't say that like we can't do it but you try sleeping with wet feet at well below freezing temperatures. Not fun at all.Okay like I said this is a fast updating blog there will be more exciting awesome journalism soon. I do suspect it will be at least a month until the next blog but they will become more frequent as we come closer to 2016!!Your hiker pal,CaRiBou","A lot of catching but in a little time
