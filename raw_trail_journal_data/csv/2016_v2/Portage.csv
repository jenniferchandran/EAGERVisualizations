Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522280,"So this is it. The culmination of a year of planning and many more of knowing I want to do this: I'm a day away from starting the Appalachian Trail. I've got all my gear together (ten pounds lighter than when I started the Long Trail this past summer, I might add) and am spending my final night in New Haven before i start my journey south. It's going to be an evening of celebration and sad goodbyes: I am having dinner with my girlfriend, Ali. We will see each other for the last time before parting for more than a month. Then, I'm off to a party; its Tap Night for the Yale Whiffenpoofs. They'll run around the campus grabbing their new members, among them me and two of my friends from my former a cappella group!Then I'll make my way back to my dad's apartment to catch a little shut-eye before heading to Laguardia bright and early tomorrow morning! I'm more anxious, stressed and excited about this than I've been about anything I can remember. Can't wait to get started.",,the Final Hours ,"Mar 02, Wed",0
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522463,"It's been a looooong day. Last night was one to remember. A lovely dinner and tearful goodbye to my girlfriend Ali, and then a full night of running across campus and partying with the current and future Whiffenpoofs. Aaaaaaand no sleep for Ben. After about three hours of shut-eye, I roused myself and packed up my backpack. My father was already up, ready to take me to New York. At 5:45, we headed out through the darkness, hedging our bets against traffic. I dozed and talked and soon we were in New York! I said my final goodbyes and headed off into the terminal. After a short snafu in which I forgot to put my Leatherman knife in my checked bag, I was off past security. Atlanta was uncharacteristically cold and wet today, but I knew I was going someplace warm and friendly: Sharon Bowman, the mother of one of the guys from my a cappella group, had offered to pick me up, feed me and shepherd me around Georgia for two days. I am so incredibly lucky to have such a wonderful and kind host! We made it to their house in Brookhaven, and I decided to take a much-needed nap before dinner. I woke up to the incredible smell of meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Mrs. Bowman thought I would want comfort food. She was right on the money. We drove to REI to pick up the only thing I needed, a gas canister (which I could not bring on the flight) and then headed home. I watched a bit of a few hockey games (the Bowmans are Canadian and have just about the best NHL TV package you'll ever encounter) and Facetimed for a few hours with Ali before heading off to bed. Tomorrow is the day. I cannot believe it's here! AT, here I come!",,Georgia Bound,"Mar 03, Thu",0
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522599,"Day 1 - Springer The day started bright and early with roofers arriving to fix the bowman's house. In addition to fixing me two bacon egg and cheese sandwiches, Mrs bowman had made me two Italian subs and a batch of cookies. Incredible snacks for later in the day. We drove the 75 minutes to Amicalola falls state park with butterflies in my stomach. As we arrived, Mrs bowman acted in loco parentis, asking me if I had my socks, and if I washed my hands after using my last bathroom. We weighed my pack (a round 35 with water and food!) and took the necessary pictures. I gave her the biggest hugs. Seriously, Sharon, if you're reading this, I cannot thank you enough for all the amazing help you've given me. And so it began. I laughed as I passed by all the landmarks I had seen so many pictures of. I admired the falls (they're way steeper and higher than I anticipated) and began the real woodsy hiking for the day. It had snowed 3 inches or so and the trail was one big slushie. But I was here. I couldn't believe it. A few bumps over mountains, one bacon egg and cheese and one run in with a group of dirt bikers later, I was on the final ascent to Springer. The summit had a decent view of the surrounding mountains but I was too elated to care. I yelled out and signed the register and took the necessary selfies with the first blaze. I met a number of other AT hikers, and one couple hiking the Benton Mackaye Trail. I nearly forgot but then remembered to pick up a pebble from the summit. I will be carrying this rock as far as I go: hopefully it ends up in Maine. The trail became far easier from the summit. It was a chill three miles down to Stover Creek shelter, my destination for the night. I began hiking with Andrew, a Mew Jersey native who keeps a fast pace and has already hiked the southern half of the trail but is trying to do it all in one shot. Stover Creek is huge and gorgeous. Many other hikers rolled in over the next few hours. I believe we have about 14, many of whom are renting nearby. I'll be sleeping in the shelter, not wanting to pitch my tent in the snow or on the wet ground if I don't have to. It seems like many of us will be keeping the same itinerary for the next few days: about 15 miles for two days to Neel Gap. Among them Andrew, Tyson (wild card) and his girlfriend Kendra from Maine, and Willard, a guy just about my age from Northern Virginia. It was a party tonight, with great talk around the fire (built by Andrew, Willard and yours truly). I can't believe it's actually happening.","Amicalola Falls Visitor Center

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522631,"Day 2 - Mountains and Magic Last night was just about the coldest temperatures I'll be expecting on this part of the trip, just about freezing. It's so early in the year that it got dark around 6:30, and even with our fire, none of us wanted to stay out. So we packed in at 7:30 in the pitch blackness. I was cold getting in my bag, but knew I would warm up as the down worked its magic. I woke up a few times in the night, Feelin toasty except for my legs (on which I should have put my rain pants). Getting up was a different story. When it first got light out, it was the coldest part of the night. My teeth chattered as I got out of my bag. 50 jumping jacks seemed to help. Only Andrew stayed in bed past 6:30 or so. Everyone seemed to have a similar end in mind: Gooch Mountain Shelter, about 13 miles away. I was second out of the shelter a few minutes after Willard, hat and gloves on. The trail down here is GORGEOUS. Wide, good tread, nicely graded. The trails tend to switchback up around mountains or glide across contours. It is different hiking than I have ever done. I keep a fast pace nearing three miles an hour and barely have to look down at my feet. I came upon Willard in a few minutes changing some clothes. He claims I would've seen his naked ass had I rounded the corner a minute earlier. We started walking together (the trail here was wide enough for two) and seemed to keep a similar pace. He pulled away from me somewhat but then stayed about 200 feet in front for a long while. Eventually we just collapsed together and we paced each other the whole day. Willard and I are very compatible. We both push each other, he on the flats and downs and I on the up hills (where my giant thighs serve me well). He is a few years older than me, and we have a similar sense of humor, and seem to want the same amount of talking on the trail. I can see myself hiking wlh him for many days to come. The morning was lovely and easy, gliding over mountains covered in a small layer of snow and down into warm valleys crowded with laurels. We passed by a number of other folks who must be on day 3. We seem to be among the most fit hikers for the moment. The hardest hike of the day was Sassafrass Mountain, which was just consistently uphill switchbacks for a mile. But then on the other side: TRAIL MAGIC! MacGuyver and No Name, two hikers from last year's class, were cooking up sausage and egg sandwiches, and had candy, fruit and water for everyone who passed by! It was a great first Magic for us and made our day much brighter. The trail around Justus creek might be the prettiest stretch of hiking I've ever done. But soon we were at Gooch Mountain Shelter for lunch. We have decided earlier in the day that rather than give ourselves a rough 15 miles ending with Blood Mountain tomorrow, we would push on through the gorgeous warm weather and camp later on. But our hard push that morning landed us in a new ""bubble:"" the people who started from Springer yesterday (i.e. Didn't do the approach). There were about ten or so people eating lunch there who began their day at Hawk Mountain Shelter. We are our lunch quick and headed on through a surprisingly taxing set of bumps, while the weather became warmer and warmer. When we got to Gooch Gap, another surprise: MORE MAGIC. Some local folks were giving away gatorades and nips of whiskey. I downed a Gatorade and grabbed a Fireball and headed out. Georgia woods are unlike what I've ever seen. The trees are old, tall and far apart, and with their leaves off, we can see the outlines of the surrounding mountains Even when the trees are in the way. The miles before Woody Gap were along a precipice down into a valley and were exhilarating. Willard pushed ahead of me for the first time since the morning. Apparently he got in the zone. The Woody Gap parking lot was packed with cars, dogs, people and hikers. Many hikers decided to spend the night here. After laying out in the sun for an hour with Willard I picked a spot for my tent set back from the road and up on a bluff. We met some of the hikers in our new bubble, James from DC and Hanna from Colorado Springs. Someone even left magic here, in the form of bread, water, fruit snacks, Ramen Noodles and hot dogs for hikers to enjoy. Willard and I guessed that Saturday is probably the most popular day for magic, but still: three in a day is quite a bit. Tomorrow will be spent almost entirely in approaching and climbing Blood Mountain, the first really serious peak of the trail, and the highest point on the Georgia AT. Then it'll be down into Neel Gal, where I'll buy some food, and decide whether to stay the night in the hostel. Gnight!","Stover Creek Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522719,"The wind howled through the gap last night. Everyone whom we talked to today commented on it. Willard and I were still up early and moving about. He commented to me that the chimney in the pit toilet was flowing backwards with the wind, creating what he called an ""air-bidet."" Not what you want. We headed out earlier than most everyone, and were soon greeted to the most spectacular morning views I've ever seen. Range upon range of foggy blue mountains to our east. I've never seen mountains quite so gentle, so peaceful, so neverending. The next miles were chill down and then up over a number of bumps approaching Blood Mountain, the AT's highest point in Georgia. We leapfrogged with a few folks we had seen the day before, among them Jason, who had to abort a thru-Hike he started on the 26th and just restarted on our day. (by the way, I forgot to mention. Kendra pointed out on day 1 that we began on an auspicious day for a hike: March 4th, aka March Forth.) The climb up Blood Mountain was not nearly as hard as I was expecting. The top looked like I expected Georgia to look: laurels crowding the trail, summery weather, rocks. But there was also snow, the first we'd seen in a day. We ate atop Blood Mountain and found Adam, one of the only hikers (we've seen) from the bubble we passed who is moving as fast as we are. The trail down to Neel Gap was flooded with day hikers and was the most technical terrain we've seen so far. Willard reprised his ability to zone out and motor right before a destination, and he arrived at the road crossing a minute or two before I did. Mountain Crossings was a zoo. Neel gap, as Willard informed me, finds itself along a motorcycle route known as The Dragon, and there must have been forty or more bikers and their bikes in the lot. A church group, to our joy, was making free burgers and offering to talk about Christ! We just took them up on the burgers. I went in and did a bit of restock. I didn't have quite enough to make it the three days I think it will take us to make it to Hiawassee. Unfortunately, the outfitter has not yet received my Leatherman, which I sent on Thursday. I will try and call them to see if they will ship it up further along the trail. Other hikers pulled in and seemed ready to stay for the evening. Willard and I snuck into the hostel bunk room and decided it looked far too junky to want to stay there rather than camp out in the perfect weather. After the longest round of pictures I've ever seen with the church group, Willard and I pushed on. I had started feeling pretty terrible when we got to Neel gap. I felt nauseated and tired and too hot. The mile climb up to Bull Gap was pretty miserable, and when I got here, I stripped to just my shorts and sat in the shade sipping water for a half hour. I thought it was mild heat stroke but soon I was cold and hydrated and still not feeling better. I set up my tent and lay down for quite a long time. When we arrived, four people were already here, Holly and BlisterJuice, sisters from southern Virginia, Massasoit, a loud mouth Patriot-fan from Massachusetts, and Rambo, who sported intricate back tattoos and a giant brown beard. Soon, a section hiker named Rock pulled up and set his stuff next to ours. He's a section hiker from Birmingham and is trying to make it to Franklin in four more days. We talked with him for most of the evening. I forced myself to get up and eat dinner around 5. My lymph node and sinuses on my right sides were swollen, and swallowing was a painful challenge. I choked down some dinner, and by the time it was done, I felt nearly better! I was so worried that I would have to abandon Willard and the trail to go get this checked out, but the Advil and the rest seemed to help. I had no doubt in my mind that I would have back on the trail as soon as I could. The night was warmer than the last, and Willard, Rock and I stood out and talked for a long time before heading to our tents. More good weather is in the cards, and the next three days should be pretty easy. Gnight!","Woody gap

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522928,"I slept pretty awfully last night. My congestion means i have to breathe through my mouth, which pushes saliva into my mouth, which I then had to swallow, which hurt terribly. It was the warmest night so far, though and the morning was clear and warm. Rock, Willard and I all got up around the same time, and though it seemed like Rock would pull ahead (because he's sectioning and has about a 10-pound pack), we stuck together the whole morning. The highlights of the morning include trail magic at Tesnatee gap right before the crazy steep hike up Wildcat Mountain and the view from the ledges at Cowrock. We dropped down to Low Gap and ate some lunch with a group of three other hikers, who seem like they'd be fun to fall in with. I only caught Jared's name. The next 7 miles were the most monotonous so far. The AT followed an old logging road, slightly uphill constantly, and as the sun rose higher and burned down, I became very tired physically and mentally. I fell behind Willard and Rock a few times while I took off pieces of gear in the heat. I knew I wanted to stop at Blue Mountain Shelter, but Willard wanted to push on to Rocky Mountain and camp with Rock, trying to make it to Hiawassee in two days. As I fell behind the last time, the two waited for me, then we walked on till Rock had to filter water. Willard and I headed up to the shelter. I finally made a phone call to my doctor and he told me what I had sounds like strep, but might be mono. Something just made me feel like I had to get it looked at, so about 30 minutes after arriving to stay the night, I was moving on. Rock walked past while we waited, and Willard, God bless him, waited for me the whole time. We walked down the steep mile and a half to Unicoi Gap and I began to stick my thumb out. Willard hung around to eat a snack and wanted to make sure I had a ride. Just as he left, a white truck pulled over and I was on my way. The driver was Ron, a building designer (not architect, apparently) from hiawassee. He said he picked up hikers a lot, and I was incredibly grateful to him. He dropped me off at the budget inn, where I'd had them hold a room for me. The Budget Inn is.... well, budget. But it doesn't have anything wrong with it, and after a shower and a change, I headed off to the hospital, fortunately right across the street. I was the only patient in the hospital at the time, and it took forever for anything to happen. I got strep, flu and mono tests, all negative, got shot full of penicillin, and finally a prescription for azithromycin and some decongestant cough syrup. The whole process took over two and a half hours. The pharmacist was closed when I got out, so I would have to wait til tomorrow to drop off my prescription. The only food that seemed open was Subway, so I got a sandwich. I Facetimed with Ali for quite a while while I slowly, painfully ate my sandwich and prepared for bed. Then I was out like a light.","Bull Gap

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522933,"I woke up not really sure what to do today. I had sleep wonderfully, and felt good to hike, but my throat had not improved whatsoever. I knew I couldn't make the 17 miles to Dicks Creek Gap with a full pack on, but I didn't want to waste the whole beautiful day doing nothing. Before starting the trail, I was pretty sure I wanted to stay self-sufficient on the whole trail, not slack-packing at all. But Good People told me that trail ethics are always subject to change. So rather than push myself beyond my limits or lose a whole day, I decided to slackpack. I caught the free shuttle up to Unicoi Gap from the Budget Inn with a pair of sisters from Florida. When we pulled up, a man was standing in the lot who looked like Rock. And to my disbelief, it was!! I got out and said hello. Unfortunately, the knee that had been bothering him in the weeks prior to his section hike had given out, and he didn't want to push on. I gave him my number and said goodbye, hoping to meet up with him tonight. He headed back to town in the same shuttle I came in. Today had a lot of climbing. This started with Rocky Mountain, which I pushed up and over quite quick, but then continued with Tray Mountain. Water was very scarce the whole day, and at the top of Tray mountain I shook my head at having to walk .3 miles downhill off the trail to water. The peaks kept coming, and I got more and more tired. I could feel that something was not right: I was getting more tired than I should have. I knew I was sick and the heat was slowing me down. Then there was Kelly Knob. Ugh, Kelly Knob. A mile of constant steep uphill that kept fooling me into thinking it was almost over. It's funny. My lack of a backpack immediately pegged me as not a trhu hiker. I explained to a few people my situation, and got understanding reactions from all but one, who replied that ""he thought it was the law to have a backpack."" It didn't make me happy to feel like a cheater or an outsider. As I began to climb up to Powell Mtn, I got a call from Willard. We had been texting all day, and now he was just in front of me! Half an hour later, I rounded a corner and found him there! The day had been just as brutal for him as for me, and he said that he never wanted to hike alone again. We leapfrogged a few times as I stopped for water and made our way down to Dicks Creek. The descent was tiring, and climbed up a few times. Willard decided that he couldn't push on anymore and would head to Hiawassee with me. Finally we made it down. The day was nice, and we began trying to hitch a ride. It took longer than it ever has for me, about half an hour. We spent our time sitting and making jokes. Willard pole danced on a sign to attract drivers. It didn't work. Finally, a white truck with a Georgia Bulldogs license plate pulled up to take us in. I couldn't believe it. It was Ron!!! This was about the biggest coincidence I have ever encountered on the trail and we laughed endlessly about it. It also came up that Ron - though he has a house in town - lives all but two nights of the year in a one-room cabin with his wife. Ron dropped us off at the Inn, and I showed Willard into the room. He rinsed off in the shower and I went and got my prescription at Rite Aid. God bless my prescription card, which saved me about 60 bucks! We had been in contact with Rock, who had just been sitting in his room in Hiawassee all day. He offered to buy us all dinner, so we decided to head to the buffet at Daniels steakhouse. I was amazed. 9 dollars for great endless fried chicken and other southern specialities. I also have never seen a restaurant with a religious motive. But everywhere you looked there was something about God. Huh. We headed back to the Inn and said goodbye to Rock, who will be getting picked up by his wife tomorrow or the next day. Willard and I spent the evening watching Tosh.0, soaking our feet and planning out our next days. We are planning on three easier days into Franklin, where we may take a day off! Gnight!","Hiawassee, via Unicoi Gap

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523168,"The shuttle from the Budget didn't leave til 9, but Willard and I were up at trail time, around 7:30. My throat swelling had gone down significantly and I was very un-congested! We putzed around, washed up, got a sandwich from Subway and headed out. The (10 person) shuttle was packed with 14 people going to dicks creek and Unicoi. We drove to our stop first and the passengers looked on enviously at Willard's sub. We piled out and I waited for Willard to finish his sandwich. We were the last ones to hit the trail. Pretty immediately, I knew something wasn't right. Willard wasn't keeping up with me the way he normally did and when I asked how he was doing, he only replied ""in pain."" He finally told me to go on ahead, that he would catch up, and I did that. I didn't see him again. He sent me a text later to the effect that he had returned to Hiawassee to take better care of the raw blisters on the back of his ankles. I don't know when or if I'll be able to find a hiking partner so compatible in pace and personality. I hope he gets back on the trail within a few days, so I can see him again. Most of the day was spent alone, but leapfrogging many other hikers from my and other shuttles. Georgia didn't let up without a fight and threw three serious mountains at us, but nothing was as challenging as the previous day. Then the trail flattened some and I saw a group of hikers up ahead and scattered shouts of joy: the Georgia-North Carolina line! I whooped with happiness and broke out lunch, and took the classic picture. It's funny seeing all these landmarks from the pictures in person. I've created their surrounding landscapes in my head, and so far none have looked anything like what I imagined. Mostly, there's just way less space than I thought. I had imagined he area next to the sign as a rolling knoll with trees or a gap, but it is in fact a very steep hillside. I filled up water and trailed behind a group of five hikers pushing for Standing Indian Shelter, like me. The first miles of North Carolina are brutal. Courthouse Bald was the single toughest hike for me so far on the trail. I passed by the group of five and soon the trail evened and I pushed a good pace. The trail was lovely all the way to Muskrat Creek shelter, and I considered just calling it a day: but I knew that wouldn't fly with my plan for Franklin. So I pushed on. I put on some music to help pass the time: I played the entire Fleet Foxes discography and only had to repeat one song before I found myself at Standing Indian, after a harder 5 miles than I expected (the grade was always easy but bad footing slowed me down). The shelter is smallish, with room only for about 6, and It faced directly into the wind. No thank you. The sites were taken mostly by older couples, but one younger couple had a very cute pit bull named Tulip. She was very angry that I did not share my dinner with her. Later on, the group of five rolled up. This had been their longest day and it seems to have been a failed experiment. They are going to slow up tomorrow. I talked mostly with Captain Chuckles (who is the first person to truly know what Portaging is) and Piglet, a guy about my age from New Orleans. We cooked and hung out as the sun went down then turned in. Tomorrow I am planning another 16 mile day, but this one's terrain will be significantly easier, with the exception of Albert Mountain. I'm sad to have lost Willard as a hiking buddy. Having someone looking out for me and keeping me on pace was lovely, and I'm going to miss him greatly. I really hope his problems improve quickly, because if love to see him back on the trail as soon as possible.","Hiawassee, via Dick's Creek Gap

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523169,"The morning started off misty and humid. I couldn't see more than 50 feet in front of me. It seemed to have rained lightly during the night, my tent was damp all over. I packed up and headed out before just about anyone else. The first 7 miles were very gentle rise and fall over standing Indian mountain and the surrounding area. It was pleasant hiking and the colder day made me happy. I ran into a ridge runner who asked me how many people were up at the shelter. I spent a pleasant morning alone and watched as the fog melted away. It's amazing to me just how much of the trail is on a ridge: very little of any hiking time has been on a ridge: mostly it's been climbing the sides of mountains. But so much of the time on the AT, the mountain slopes away on both sides and views are available whenever there is a break in the trees. After lunch, I started up the craziest climb of the day: Albert Mountain, 400 feet straight up in .3 miles. The views were lovely off the top and a good reward for a tough push. Then it was an easy 2.5 down to Long Branch shelter, the newest shelter I've ever seen, with two huge shelves of bunks. There were only four of us, Paul, whom I rode on the shuttle the first morning out from Hiawassee with, and a father son pair out on a 4-day hike. We hung around and ate dinner, I dried out my tent in the nice weather. Then the cavalry came. Ben and Derek (aka Statler and Waldorf) and MagicMan from Muskrat shelter pulled in and were followed closely by the four guys I met at Standing Indian. Then two more hikers I've been leapfrogging the past few days. I enjoy Statler and Waldorf and Magicmans company, but I could do without the four. They take up a lot of space. Everyone's packed in the shelter and my early arrival makes me feel like I should've pushed on 3.5 to Rock Gap to avoid the crowd. But whatever. It'll be nice to have company in the morning.","Standing Indian Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523299,"I forgot to turn off the alarm on my watch, so the morning started for me (and everyone else on the top bunk) at about 6:30. I began moving around and packed up. The morning was clear, good news on a day that was supposed to be rainy. I was about the second out of camp, just after Magic Man. The miles to Winding Stair were mostly lovely and gentle and had some nice views. I also ran into a kid named Nutella who had just started the day at Rock Gap. A former thru hiker had left cases of soda right near the trailhead and I picked up a Dr. Thunder. Magic man and I started trying to hitch into town. Statler and Waldorf showed up momentarily. Soon enough, out from a line of cars pulled three identical red pickups who beckoned us into the flatbeds. Soon enough, we were speeding down the highway at 60 miles an hour, holding on for dear life. The trucks dropped us off right off the highway, near three eagles outfitters but far from the actual town and the budget inn, where I was planning to spend the night. I went in and tried to find a fix for my poles (the tips of which have sheared off, making them less ""sticky"") but they had none. I waited for a while in a parking lot before setting off for town with the other three. We were picked up after a few minutes of walking by another former thru hiker who brought us to the budget inn. But I was having second thoughts. It was such a beautiful day and rain was called for for the next three. I didn't want to sit around. I asked him to drive me to Outdoor 76, a local outfitter. I asked there about my poles, and they told me to look online. Turns out Black Diamond has a very easy online form for warranty claims. I had a reply in only a few hours! I'm getting some new tips. A generous but somewhat creepy man at the store just offered to buy me new poles, but I declined. I said hi to Rob, whom I had sent pictures of my feet a month ago for advice, and told him I was happy with my boots and my new insoles. I foolishly forgot to buy freeze dried meals before heading to eat a burger at the local 50s cafe. I walked down to the ingles market to resupply. After buying my groceries I was offered a ride, amazingly, by the same creepy guy from Outdoor 76. He had brought another hiker down to buy groceries. I was not very happy to take it, but I was about to, and then another old man offered to bring me to Winding Stair. I had him drive me back to Outdoor 76, where i bought a couple meals, then headed back out through the sunny afternoon. I knew I had to push, but I really wanted to make it to Wayah Bald, one of the nicest views in North Carolina, before it got dark or I got rained on. But it was 10 miles away, and I'd already done 7.3 from Long Branch. But I began hiking and hiking quick. The terrain got progressively harder and I began to feel more and more exhausted, but I made it. With the stone observation tower behind me, I looked down into the valley and away to the mountain ranges in the distance. It was a glorious glorious view, and the falling sun made it that much more lovely (plus I only had a mile of hiking left!!) I threw on some Fleet Foxes and made my way down the mountain to Wayan Bald Shelter. The campsites and shelter were pretty full, but I snagged the last spot in the shelter, not wanting to get rained on. I had found myself among a slower moving bubble of hikers, among them Rusty, cheetah, turtle, Corncob, and jelly ankles. It was already about 6:30, so I made dinner quick and was busy the whole night before bed. The most memorable piece of the evening talk is a song from Corncob, which is subject to infinite variations: ""I got my crab hand,I got my normal hand,I'm bout to cut some stuff upWith my crab hand."" Corncob - ""Cob"" - and I traded back knock knock jokes while cheetah and jelly wrote in their journals before we all turned in. The night was warm and I was looking forward to a good sleep.","Long Branch Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523307,"Man did I sleep great last night. I really didn't wake up at all during the night, which is a first for me, and when I finally awoke rather abruptly, it was 7 o'clock, the sun was out, and people were already brushing their teeth! I was also amazed at the weather. They had been calling for rain for days, so I was surprised to see sunlight streaming into the shelter on a perfect partly cloudy day. The group of hikers I had spent the night with have a hilarious dynamic. If they all stick together I'm sure they'll all make it, because they seem really tight and fun. Makes me miss having a couple buddies to go out every day with, but frankly I'm enjoying improvising and setting my own pace for everything. Despite not being the first up, I was the first out from the shelter. I don't mess around in the mornings, I Spose. The hiking was as it had been, gentle to steep climbs and descents around and up decent sized mountains. I passed a group of four hikers I was amazed to see again: I had passed them last night at silers bald and was very skeptical when they said they were planning to make it to the next shelter. I also passed two hikers who, from their short shorts and big thighs, had to be former thru hikers doing a section. They had a tiny shiba dog named Katana. The highlight of the day was Wesser Bald, the last big climb before the long descent into the Nantahala Outdoor Center. The climb was a little tougher than normal, but only 1.5 miles. And at the top was an observation tower that I'd heard quite a bit about. I brought my whole pack up. Wow. The view is probably the greatest I've had in my life: endless ridges of wooded mountaintops in every direction, and the valley of Franklin below me. I could definitely pick out Standing Indian Mountain behind me, and certainly a few ranges of the Smokies (though I'm not sure what's what). I ate some lunch and had a long FaceTime session with Ali before heading out. Ali is leaving on a cruise this weekend, so I'll be without communication from her for the next week.  A very nice local day hiker couple came up just as I was packing up and asked me questions about my trip and wished me luck. The trail is known for dropping from Wesser Bald very steeply and unforgivingly down to the NOC, but the most remarkable parts for me were when the trail insisted on climbing back up a ridge and spitting us back out under the baking sun for no reason. Seriously, if this is one of the most steep parts of the trail, why make things worse? I only understood one of these climbs, which put me on top of a cliff called the Jumpoff looking out into the valley. It was neat. The trail was steep, but with the exception of a few short sections, was not nearly as bad as the descents off of Camels Hump, Mansfield or a number of other northern VT mountains. It was just long. Eventually, the NOC hove into sight. It is a whole complex of wooden buildings, but I first had to check in at the General Store. I picked up my room key, and soon went back in and perused their beer selection. I chose an Arrogant Bastard Ale and was surprised when the cashier offered to open it for me. I asked whether drinking outside was allowed and she looked confused that I even asked. I grinned and took my beer out and drank it in the sun, looking down into the Nantahala River. I decided to go check out my room, but was waylaid by the trail magic of burgers on the other side of the river. The room is more Hostel-like than I expected, just a couple of twin bunk beds and a heat/cool system with a big set of showers and toilets a short walk away in another building. I sat around for a long time massaging my feet before finally deciding to take a shower. I then brought my laundry down to the washers (back at the general store) before realizing they had no detergent. The outfitter had closed but I went up and knocked on the door and soon enough had some detergent to do the wash, as well as some for the man who traded me two bucks in quarters at the machines. I went in and had some dinner at the restaurant and ways joined by another hiker who is coming off of two zeroes here for his sprained ankle. I noted that the sprawling outdoor bbq restaurant hadn't even opened yet, and my companion said that this place is still in off-season and won't really get going til May, when huge rafting groups come through. All afternoon, I had watched kayakers play in the rapids and holes next to the outfitter, but now they were gone. I picked up my laundry and headed back to my room for the night.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523444,"It was time for a break. I hadn't taken a zero yet, my knees were feelin it on the descent from Wesser yesterday, and the pouring rain this morning all sealed it: I was going to take a zero here at the Nantahala Outdoor Center. After quite a process in order to book me in for another night (I did have to switch rooms, but they were right next door) but I got it. I was sort of angry today when I found out there was a bunkroom for about half of what I paid for the night, and I might have gotten to hang out with other hikers. I wish they had told me that when I asked what my options were when I called them up. Oh well. I Spose the privacy was nice. The morning started very slowly. I putzed about in my room, and had to clean up and move out because I was switching rooms. Then I got some breakfast at the restaurant (where I finally learned what homefries are supposed to taste like, damn!). I did a lot of sitting in the outfitter playing on my phone, and I talked to Ali for a while as she stood in line to get on her cruise ship. It was a pretty boring morning, but it wasn't active, so I Spose it was restful.Around noon, I began to see some folks I knew, and it soon became a parade of people I had passed in the last couple days. The first few to roll up were the ones I spent the night with at Wayah Bald Shelter: Cob, Rusty, Turtle, Jelly and Cheetah. We all went in to the restaurant and grabbed lunch with Turtle's father, who had come to meet him. Everyone got huge burgers except me, who was stilled mostly stuffed from breakfast, so I just got a few wings. We were joined by Ash, and then White Rabbit and her father Large, all of whom I met at the border. The next hours were filled with sun and beer and relaxation and were truly wonderful. Among the new hikers I saw were Shrink, a psychiatrist from Miami, and Rhodo, a sophomore at Haverford, who happens to be good friends with our family friend's son Noah Lifset. Magic Man (now styled just as Magic) showed up and we traded beers and talked with North Star, an older hiker from Vermont whom I had met at the NC/GA border who also keeps a Trailjournals log. We hung out in the laundry room and on the water just recapping the days so far. Statler and Waldorf also showed up later in the day and went to find a stealth camping spot down the railroad tracks. I went in for dinner with a similar crew as for lunch, talked a lot with Rusty and Jelly. Magic came in and told me that his buddy whom he'd planned to stealth with shoved off up the mountain. I told him he was free to come crash in the other bunk in my room! I finished dinner and Magic and I headed up to the room. He went to take a shower and I hung out in the common areas with the other hikers. We sang Bohemian Rhapsody and other hiker jams together before Magic and I headed off to bed. Back on the trail tomorrow!","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523525,"Magic and I set our alarms for 7 am, but for the first time it was dark out when I woke. I dozed a bit and then began to pack up and went up the bathroom building. I was ready a little before Magic was and decided to head out and just leave him the keycard. I believe I was the first one out of the NOC, as I had cobwebs over my face as I walked. The trail was just consistently up for about 7 miles. Nothing terribly challenging, and no real reasons to stop. It just took quite a while. I passed Casey Jones and The Brit, some hikers who camped up a bit out from the NOC last night. There were a few nice views down again into the valley on the way up. I was moving quickly, trying to not get rained on at all. I grabbed some water at Sassafrass Gap Shelter before making the final ascent up Cheoah Bald. The view from the top was spectacular. I've never encountered Balds before, but they really fascinate me. Instead of a rocky outcropping or split in the trees, there is just an area of short grass on top, like a field but more Ill-kept looking. The really wide balds are ahead of me, and I can't wait to see more of them. The weather had been clear and sunny all morning, and it stayed that way as I ate lunch at Locust Cove Gap. But when I finished up, the weather had turned. It was overcast and windy, and I pushed myself on, willing myself to beat the rain. I got sprinkled on at Simp Gap and then again right after Stecoah Gap, but nothing serious. At Stecoah Gap, two former thru hikers began to set up trail magic just as I arrived. Being the first hiker they had seen, they quickly handed me a Coke and two chocolate chip creme pies. They apparently set up for hot dogs, but I left before they could give me one. The section of trail from Stecoah to Sweetwater Gap is about the nicest cut and constructed trail I've ever seen. But as soon as I passed Sweetwater Gap, the trail just began climbing steeply. This was Jacob's Ladder, one of the most notorious climbs in the South. It wasn't anything special, it just went on being steep longer than almost any climb so far. I passed three older gentlemen on the way up. As I topped out from Jacobs Ladder, there was a serious short spurt of rain that made me get out my coat, but it wasn't long for this world. I quickly made my way down to Brown Fork Gap shelter, and who should be there but Lassie, whom I talked and ate dinner with my first night at NOC. He has been taking shorter days since he sprained his ankle. The three older gentlemen showed up momentarily. They are Journeyman and his friend Pete (who just joined at NOC) and Sojo, whom I soon figured out was a fellow Yalie. We talked for quite a while about Yale and the English Major. Sojo has a cute golden retriever named Theo. Soon the rain got bad, and the shelter was almost filled. Next to arrive was Mantis, whom i'd seen but not talked to at NOC. he's a native of Fairfield CT and a UVA graduate, and is planning to attend Yale's SOM in the fall. Honeybuns showed up briefly but decided to move on 5 miles to the next shelter. Then the rain got BAD. White Rabbit showed up next and claimed the last spot in the shelter. Then Magic and Greyhound showed up and unfortunately we had to turn them away. They are camped out in a gully next to the shelter. We ate dinner and the weather cleared and became sunny again. Large showed up and was greeted with White Rabbit making him dinner. But no shelter spot. The rest of the evening was spent sitting and journaling and also reading the Gospel according to John (someone left a pocket New Testament here that I have half a mind to take). Still not accustomed to the time change, we al headed to bed with it still light out.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523653,"The dawn broke clear and beautiful this morning, and I was among the first out, behind Sojo and Mantis. The first part of the hike took us over a long exposed ridge line, and we had beautiful views down to Fontana Lake and the surrounding valleys, where low hanging fog made an ocean of cloud throughout the morning. As I created the hill beyond Cable Gap Shelter, I saw the dam for the first time and whooped with joy. Nothing particularly exciting happened during the hiking. The section right above Fontana was the muddiest I have seen yet and was somewhat slow going. Soon enough I was at the Fontana Marina. I shrugged off my pack and headed to the bait shop, where Lassie claimed the best resupply was to be had. That was a lie. I picked up an apple fritter and a Coke only to remember on my walk back up that I was saving those 3 dollars for the shuttle ride into Fontana. When I got back up, Timeout (the only hiker who started after me whom I've yet seen) said he'd already called the shuttle and that they would be there within 15 minutes. Mantis showed up and we all waited. And waited. And then White Rabbit showed up. And magic. And Little Tree and Pots. And it had been about two hours. This was ridiculous. Magic managed to hitch in, but repeated calls to the hotel and still nothing happened. Finally, a van carrying linens came over and we all piled on amongst clean and dirty towels and headed to the lodge. White Rabbit stuck around and waited for her dad and later claimed that once he showed up, she had no trouble calling for a ride. I was going because I needed to resupply and get my permit for the Smokies. We arrived at the general store and I was disappointed to see no freeze-dried meals (as the guidebook claimed they had) and no Spam Singles left in the Spam Singles box. It is an iffy resupply option at best, but apparently only opened yesterday for business this year. The next day's through the smokies will be an experiment for me, food-wise. I went up and printed off my smokies permit in the lobby and the offer to split a room with White Rabbit and Large became too good to pass up. I put my stuff in their room before taking a shower and heading back down the general store. I bought some dinner /alternatives/ and a six pack of beer, which I proceeded to share with North Star and Greyhound on the porch of the store. Greyhound and I bonded over the Red Hot Chili Peppers before I went to find dinner. I got dinner at the hotel restaurant with White Rabbit and Large. Like the NOC, it seems to be very early in season for this place. The service was exceptionally slow with only one waitress working. Bed was soon after, with White Rabbit struggling to fix a problem with her phone. Tomorrow will find me crossing the Fontana Dam and then entering the smokies, and then following the NC/TN line, where I'll be for 200 or so miles! Fun to be here!","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523739,"I surprisingly didn't sleep all that well last night. Couldn't get to a comfortable temperature. Still, we all woke up at around 7:30. I ate a pop tart and packed up. I headed to the lobby to find that the first shuttle down to the marina wouldn't be til 8:30. I toyed with trying to hitch but then just sat around in the lobby. Decided it wouldn't be worth the walk down to the general store. The shuttle left on time, unlike yesterday, and soon I found myself back at the marina. Timeout and I hit the trail first and paced each other for quite a while. We passed the Fontana ""Hilton"" shelter, which was nearly abandoned thanks to the many warnings of the trail magic providers at Stecoah gap. It's a shame, because it looks like an amazing place to spend the night. Picnic tables and showers and everything. We began road walking down past the construction at the visitor center and met up with Handles, a friend of Lassie's who apparently spent last night in a secret storage closet at the resort. We all began the walk across the dam together. It was pretty impressive, and took more than 5 minutes to cross. I made sure to take lots of photos! Then it was up into the Smokies! I dropped off my permit at the box and began the long ascent to the ridges of the mountains on the Tennessee border. My pack was heavier than it's been in quite some time, and I seriously felt it on the climb up to Shuckstack. I filtered water from a stream on the way up and was amazed to see a little crawfish crawling right next to my bottle! First time seeing them in the wild. I took the side trail up to the Shuckstack Fire tower. It is a rickety thing and the wind was howling through a few empty window panes at the top. Timeout was up there with me. The view was pretty cool, we could see all the high ridges to come. Back at the trail junction I met White Rabbit and began pacing with her for the next miles. Right before Doe Knob we ran into Magic, who apparently got offered a night at the home of a local yesterday. I need to stick with him more. He just gets lucky. At the top of Doe Knob, we officially hit the Tennessee border! I was the most excited of anybody, never having been there. I ate lunch at the top and took advantage of the little bottle of olive oil Timeout gave me this morning. It was a few more drops and climbs to Mollies Ridge Shelter, a beautiful stone hut in a field. I hung out, filtered water and sat, talking with magic and white rabbit and timeout. White rabbit stuck around to wait for her dad, but magic and I pushed on to the next shelter three miles away. When I got there, I still had more in the tank and decided to go with timeout to Spence Field. It was a tougher three miles, but was still pretty easy. This was a longer day than I've had in a while, but the weather was great and I felt good. Spence Field looks just like the other shelters I've seen in the Smokies. They're all big and stone and have bunks for 12 or14 people.Timeout and I are here with two sets of section hikers, a family from Texas and a group of friends from nearby. I might've tented, but it is not allowed in the Park unless the shelter is full. The family was very inquisitive, sweet and have clearly done a lot of backpacking together already. I made dinner and set up my stuff in my preferred spot, lower level on the right against the wall. Tomorrow is supposed to be very beautiful as well, and I will probably end up finishing the day with Clingman's Dome, the highest point in Tennessee and the highest point on the AT. It'll be another long day, but I feel ready to up my miles.","Fontana Marina
",Spence Field Shelter ,"Mar 16, Wed",18.50
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523895,"Slept pretty wonderfully last night, had a lot of space to myself, what with five people in a 14-person shelter. The morning was clear and beautiful, and I could already tell I was about to have spectacular views all day. I would have to decided whether to do a shortish day to Double Spring Gap, or to push (as Timeout was planning) to Mount Collins Shelter, not only more than 6 miles further on, but also half a mile of the trail. The morning was full of tough, tough climbs, tons of up and down. The first big one took us up to Rocky Top. Yes, Rocky Top Tennessee, like the song. The view was beautiful. The AT goes through about the middle of the park, but you wouldn't know it from up here. To the north, there are only a few ridges before flat level plain around Gatlinburg. But to the south, the mountains extended forever, far beyond Fontana into Georgia. Timeout and I spent quite a bit of time just soaking in the view. Rocky Top is actually just a subsidiary peak of Thunderhead mountain, but has much better views (and also a better name for a song). The miles to Derrick Knob Shelter were very taxing, and I took a decent rest at the shelter. But the trail after the shelter was like night and day with what came before: the trail for the rest of the day until just before Clingman's was gorgeous. Wide and well graded. I was convinced I couldn't go on after Double Spring in the morning; this made me feel differently. I had been wanting to up my miles, and it seemed like I could make it. I ate some lunch just before the second shelter. There are only two miles between Silers Bald and Double Gap shelters, but they were very neat, heading along a knife edge ridge, one foot in TN and the other in NC! When I arrived at Double Spring, I found a whole clique of about 8 thru hikers. The only one I recognized was Honeybuns, whom I'd met at NOC. Most of my preconceptions about thru hikers have been incorrect, but these were just about the most stereotypical ones I'd met. They talked a lot about smoking weed, two were German, and one very long-haired, sunglasses-wearing hiker - appropriately named Dudeman - was giving Tai Chi lessons. They had been hiking together for a few days and clearly had a bunch of inside jokes, and didn't appear very welcoming. I talked to Honeybuns for a little and moved on. Apparently their plan was to catch the sunset off Clingman's Dome and then night hike to Mount Collins. Seemed like a bad idea to me. Four miles in the dark? The terrain got tough again after the shelter. The climb to Clingman's was serious, lots of steep steps. On a different note, there were suddenly evergreen trees for the first time on the trail! The tough, muddy trail, the rocks, the close trees and the water running down the trail made the whole thing feel like Vermont and the Long Trail. All the hardships were familiar and were comforting in some odd way. I spotted the observation deck from a while away, and soon I was right under it! I took the side trail up, deciding to bring my pack first because this is the highest it'll get on the whole trail and two because the wind was blowing hard and my back was soaked and I would've become even more frozen than I already was. There was a young couple up at the top who took my picture and asked me about my hike. She asked me whether I was cold, to which I responded, ""Freezing."" Out of the tree cover, it was cold cold cold. I Spose at more than 6600 feet, the warm sun can only do so much. Speaking of elevation, I think it probably made the hike even harder than it would've been. I was panting climbing Clingman's. The hike down to Collins Gap was very reminiscent of Vermont, and I sped over it. I turned on some music for the last climb of the day, and soon I found myself at the turnoff for the Mount Collins Shelter. I (and Timeout) had thought it would be abandoned, being half a mile off the trail, but when I arrived, it was already packed. A Ridgerunner asked me to take the last spot in the shelter, and having seen very few good tent spots, I was happy to oblige. There are two groups of section hikers here, and a number of thru hikers, including Thor and One Feather, whom I talked to while making my dinner. As the sun set, the crew from Double Spring showed up and made food and talked loudly. I stayed up and talked with Chloe the Ridgerunner (who hiked the trail last year with the name Vulture) and an older man known simply as The Natural. When I finally turned in, the shelter was packed tight and I felt like I might've been better off camping out. Oh well!","Spence Field Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524024,"Slept pretty poorly last night being surrounded by two people. I woke up abruptly to sunlight and everyone else getting packed up, and Thor and One Feather already gone (I wish I'd known, I would've spread out). I spoke more with Chloe, who was a French major. I packed up quick as I could, trying to beat the crowds out. Timeout wasn't around. He had been planning to stop in Gatlinburg to replace his shoes, which are falling apart. The morning was clear and the hiking was mostly downhill to Newfound Gap, and I motored. I took quite a long break at Newfound, because I had reception, so I posted my journal and texted my parents. The crew from Double Spring was there, about to head to Gatlinburg. Apparently they call themselves the Rat Turds. Hmm. I took a photo next to the NC/TN line sign and pushed on. It wasn't hard hiking but I struggled for some reason up the next miles to Icewater Shelter. I met a hiker named Butter who seems rather shy n reserved. The next bunch of miles were incredibly cool. First off there was Charlie's Bunion, a huge rock outcropping with great views of the surrounding cirque. The next set of miles is known as the Sawteeth, and weaves up over a narrow ridge falling away incredibly steeply on either side. It was only a two foot corridor at times and was super cool. When the wind blew from the sunny south side of the ridge, the air was sun baked and hot, but when it blew from the shady northern side, it was cold and fresh. This was the first day in a while I hiked in my leggings; the temp was low up at the peaks! I came up on a meadowy area, and who should I see but Timeout! Apparently his wife is coming to meet him in Hot Springs to bring him a new pair of shoes, so he called off the trip to Gatlinburg. I also ran into Hot Rabbit and Bald Eagle, a thru hiker son and his father who is meeting him from Newfound to Davenport Gaps. The trail wound up and down with great views almost the whole time. Eventually I came to the turnoff for Pecks Corner Shelter, and filled up water with Timeout, and Hot Rabbit and Bald Eagle. Another hiker also pulled up, Learning Curve, who had taken the photo of me at Newfound, and had caught up. He gave me some Sour Patch Kids. Whaddaguy. We pushed off for the final five miles and three hills of the day, and Learning Curve proved to be the first hiker that moves faster than Timeout and I do. The climbs were tough and long over to Tricorner Knob. We passed a large group of who must be Amish kids led by a man with a huge beard. They all had the same shirts, pants and hats. It was a bit surreal and was the subject of much later discussion. The shelter is much the same as the others in the smokies, with two wide shelves of bunks, but it also has a water source extremely close by. We loved that. Timeout and I arrived much the same time and found Learning Curve setting up his hammock. He is named that because he tried to hike the AT last year with no prior backpacking experience and had to be taught just about everything. We fixed dinner and soon more day hikers showed up, as well as Hot Rabbit and his father. Then the rest of the crew who has stayed in Gatlinburg with Learning Curve showed up. There was King Arthur, with whom I sang many show tunes (and the entirety of Bohemian Rhapsody, again), Judge, Seam, and Scum. It got very chilly and Judge made the first fire in the shelter chimneys that I've seen. It drew the fire far better than anyone had expected. Seam brought a huge amount of wood, that hero. Everyone hung out inside the shelter and while a few went to bed, Curve, Rabbit, Scum, Seam and I sat around tending the fire and keeping warm. It was a lovely way to end the day","Mount Collins Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524099,"I slept quite well, but the section hikers we stayed with need a lesson in morning courtesy. If you're waking up two hours before everyone else, it's best not to talk loudly and shine your headlamps in the eyes of those still trying to sleep. Alright, getting down off my high horse. So I was up a little earlier than I expected, but that was ok. Rain was called for later in the afternoon and it was nice to get a move on. The sectioners and Timeout were out quite a bit before I was, but I went before most of the crew who came in later last night. The trail was as we expected, almost entirely flat with a few uphills in the morning. The sections in dense spruce forest were wonderfully spooky, as the fog was reducing visibility to about a hundred feet. I had one moment of just about perfect serenity, as I exited the trees onto a bald area, and the clouds parted momentarily so I could see away down into the valleys of North Carolina with blue skies. There was only the little rush of wind, the occasional bird call and the soft crunch of dirt and gravel under my foot. With the exception of a few climbs, the day was entirely downhill, falling over 5000 feet from Mt Guyot down to the Pigeon River Bridge. It was not difficult hiking, but all the downhill gave me some shin splints in my left leg. I tried to nurse it on my way down, but it gave me pain throughout the afternoon. My experience with shin splints has always been short-lived, however, which is a good sign. Learning Curve passed me at the Mount Cammerer side trail, which I might have taken if the view weren't mostly obscured and it weren't more than half a mile off the trail. Some section hikers yesterday said it was worth it. Ah well. They had time to kill. Just after the intersection, a strange pole plant knocked my phone out of my hip belt pocket, which i must have left open; it landed face down, and when I picked it up, the screen was cracked to bits. I had kept my phone in a lifeproof case for the first week of my trip, but started taking it off because it blocked the microphones and I couldn't make calls anymore. I cursed myself that I didn't put it on today, that I didn't zip my pocket, that I didn't put it somewhere else, everything. The phone still works, but it's much harder to text, and the front-facing camera is useless, covered in shattered glass. The phone was giving me a lot of trouble already; it has a habit of being at 40 or 50 percent battery, then thinking its out of battery and turning off and not turning on without a charger. I knew it had to be replaced eventually, but this certainly hurried the process. I stopped in for lunch at Davenport Gap Shelter and showed Curve my phone. He's a really nice guy, and was very sympathetic. He was setting up his hammock even though it wasn't even 2 o'clock, because he knew the gang from last night was going to want to stay. I hope I see him later on, he's got a great pace but seems to want to try and keep up the social aspect of the trail and have a real group of friends instead of pushing miles. I continued down to Davenport Gap, where I took a picture showing me that I officially made it out of the Smokies! And more, someone left a few cans of beer by the sign! I happily drank a beer before pushing on. The trail followed a very pretty creek with lovely cascades, and a few tent sites I bet Curve wished he'd known about. I had been sprinkled rain on a few times in the morning, but as I bottomed out onto a roadwalk, it started to really rain. I made my way across a bridge and under Interstate 40, stopping to talk with a Sobo section hiker before making the final tough climb up to the road where Standing Bear Farm is. I arrived wet, but not soaked, and, after a short while of looking around, was given the ""Nickel Tour"" from Lumpy, who looks straight out of central casting for Duck Dynasty. He must have given the speech a thousand times, but seemed pleased when I caught the references to Alice's Restaurant (""a hiker kitchen with all the modern inconveniences and implements of Dee-struction). I laid my stuff out on a bunk, and was about to take a shower, but then I (and my dad, who has done more planning for this trip than I have) got to thinking: tomorrow is going to be ugly, I would love to get my phone replaced, and the veritable metropolis of Asheville is an hour away. I asked Lumpy about a shuttle, and he quoted me a pretty reasonable price. I called around to all the other shuttle services in the Awol guidebook (as well as the other one Lumpy whispered to me that I should try), who all said no or quoted me much higher prices. I waited around for quite a while for the shuttle driver to return, and he seemed a little disappointed that he was about to head back out for two hours. After a host of cell phone difficulties that have convinced me more and more that I need a new phone, I had a hotel reservation and a ride into Asheville. It was already about 7 o'clock, but I hopped into a truck with Morgan, my driver, a 26 year old self-proclaimed Tramp who has been working at the hostel for a year after a long period of world travel. His two Boston Terriers were in the cab with us, and they were very cute. Lulu liked putting her head on my leg and sleeping.Soon enough we were in Asheville. We passed through downtown before Morgan dropped me off at the Marriott in its strip-mall type location, surrounded by a few fast food joints (Waffle House is on the menu for breakfast). As I checked in, a man who was shepherding a lot of tweens in soccer jerseys asked me if I was an AT hiker and wished me luck on my journey. I Spose the short shorts, backpack, down jacket and poles gave me away. I took a very generous shower and started my laundry before heading down to the strip for some food. I was planning on going to Cook Out, a burger chain that I've never seen before, but Morgan swore by, but only the drive-thru was open. So I went on down to chili's and got a burger, some chips and guac and strawberry lemonade and watched some March Madness. I headed back up to the hotel and turned over and finished my laundry before heading to bed. Tomorrow I'll sleep in and grab some breakfast before heading out and trying to get a new phone. Then I'll run some more errands and then maybe head into Asheville proper before getting a pickup from Morgan and heading back to the trailhead.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

I was up at 7:30 and could not fall back asleep. I laid around in bed for a while before deciding it was time for a foray into a wilderness even greater than the Smokies. That's right. I was going to Waffle House. It was freezing outside and I made the descent to the nearby Waffle House as quickly as I could. I was greeted inside with a warm welcome and the smell of things fried and buttery. I stared at the menu and got called ""Hon"" many times before I even could decide what to get. I finally decided to try a bit of everything, eggs, bacon, toast, grits, a waffle, and, as the menu suggested, Hash browns, scattered, smothered and covered. For those of you who like me who have never heard of this phrase which is apparently known to all who live in the South, it referred to hash browns served loose in a fried bunch rather than a biscuit-shaped cake, smothered in diced onions and covered in melted cheese. Frankly, having had them, I don't want hash browns any other way for the rest of my life. The waffle was also delicious. All in all, my Waffle House experience was divine, and I will be returning as often as possible. I returned to my hotel room and organized myself, took a shower, checked out, and headed over to the AT&T store. Thanks to my father - who may be loving this trip even more than I am - I was greeted knowingly by Jason, who spoke with him on the phone yesterday. Soon enough, everything was squared away and I was in the possession of a new iPhone 6! However, it was going to take quite a while to transfer over information, so I crossed the street (I enjoyed being the only pedestrian in the entirety of the Asheville Mall and holding up traffic) and went to the Barnes and Noble. I got a drink and killed time reading a book of poetry by Yehuda Amichai (a book I very highly considered buying before finally putting it back). I stopped in at the food court (and noted that Chick-Fil-A was indeed closed on Sunday) and got some chicken teriyaki and fried rice. It had been over two hours by this point, so I returned to AT&T, where my loaded phone was waiting. I spent a few more hours there configuring email and other apps that needed re-registration before finally heading out just before 5. I wanted to go see downtown Asheville, but the situation was a bit dire; the rain had picked up and the wind was blowing, and I was three miles away, and didn't want to walk. I tried asking for a ride from a few cars and sticking my thumb out before giving up. Feeling somewhat depleted and unsure what to do, I stopped beneath an awning to put on my pack raincover and noticed that I was at a bus stop. They even had instructions for how to check when the next bus would be, and as I typed in the numbers, wouldn't you know it, a bus pulled right up! Overjoyed, I asked if he was going downtown, which he was, and a dollar later, I was riding public transit to exactly where I needed to be! I was soon in downtown Asheville, and after putzing about, I made my way over to the Asheville Brewery, where I ordered a beer and sat down outside on their patio - abandoned since it was so cold out. I knew I had a few hours at least to kill before Maria from Standing Bear came to pick me up. I facetimed Ali, who has just returned from her cruise to the Bahamas, for quite a long time, going through three glasses of beer and a chicken park sandwich. Unable to stand the cold much more, I eventually went inside and was chatted up by two folks from Wisconsin, decked out in full Badger paraphernalia, who were stopped in to watch the basketball game before finishing up their road trip to Hiltonhead. Near 8, I was picked up by Maria, the owner of the hostel, and Gator, another man who works there. We drove back through the darkness and the snow to the hostel, where a clean, dry bunk was waiting for me, and a wood stove was heating the bunkhouse. Tomorrow I'll be back on the trail, but I'm glad to have missed this cold and dreary day and to have gotten done what I needed to do!","Asheville via Standing Bear Farm

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524369,"This morning as I woke up I could hear a strange repetitive sound, muffled, but it sounded like an alarm clock, but too infrequent. I finally took out my earplugs and realized it was a rooster. A freakin rooster woke me up. Welcome to Standing Bear. I got my things together a little bit and went into the hostel's resupply room. I had been warned to check the expiration date. I pulled off two tuna packets off a shelf and checked. Yup. Expired in 2014... Fortunately there were fresh ones behind it but like still... You can't legally sell that to people. I picked up a pop tart and a few energy bars for breakfast and some Spam for later in the day. I didn't need much, as I had an extra dinner and would be hitting Hot Springs in two days. During my breakfast one of the work-for-stay workers brought in clementines and bananas and Elk jerky for us; it was a lovely gesture. Butter was there, as were a few other thru hikers I hadn't met yet. It was finally time to head out and settle up. As Lumpy tallied what I owed, he did not recall that I had had a ride to Asheville. I toyed with not reminding him for a moment before just telling him. He looked worried that he had forgotten and in his homely way said that my honesty was ""Both rare and refreshing."" I thought best not to abuse the trust of decent people. As the day went on and I thought more about the expired food I felt less and less sympathetic. Lumpy did knock a few dollars off the price of my stay, either because I was honest, or I was already paying a great deal for the rides into Asheville. I headed out and began the long ascent up Snowbird Mountain. I had heard that the smokies got quite a bit of snow last night, but it was something entirely more impressive to see the huge bulk of the mountains capped in white and wrapped in storm clouds behind me. The hike took quite a while and the snow slowly went from a little on the ground to hanging off the trees to three inches deep on the trail. The bald summit of Snowbird was a sight, the posts with blazes on them covered in rime ice and pockets of wind blown snow six inches deep, the wind pushing pretty solidly. The trail wound down and around a few peaks before beginning an assault on Max Patch, one of the absolute highlights of the Southern AT, the first real full bald with panoramic views for miles. I passed the troop of morose Boy Scouts who had been at Standing Bear when I arrived two nights ago. And soon enough, the trees vanished and all that was left was short grass and a trail leading up the side of a huge hill. Some blessed soul left bottles of mountain dew and Pepsi next to the first post (how they blaze the trail over the balds). I heard from a hiker later that the Boy Scouts took about two each and wiped out the rest of the supply that is clearly intended for thru hikers. The bald on Max Patch is amazing. It took about ten minutes to climb from the start of no trees to the top, that's how big it is. It had astounding views of the smokies, down to the plains to the northeast, the mountains of North Carolina and the peaks I'll be heading over in the next week, including (I think) Roan high knob and Unaka. There were numerous day hikers even in the crazy conditions (it was a bluebird day, just frigid and the ground was snowy). A few took my picture for me and asked me about my hike. I stood for a while alone at the summit and could have happily stayed longer, but I was getting cold. The AT had dug out a trough in the ground over the bald and the way the wind had worked had filled it six inches in snow, so I stood on the outside of the trough and walked down the bald. Right at the reentrance to the trees, I found Brit and Slug, two hikers I hadn't seen since Fontana whom I enjoy very much. Brit is, well, British and just around my age, and Slug is an excitable and lovably foul-mouthed 55-year old man. They had started at Groundhog Creek shelter, 7 miles into my day. Slug had many choice words for the Boy Scouts and their leader, who had apparently let them just throw trash everywhere. These choice words included ""dumbfucks"" and ""sad-sacks."" He's a fun guy. The next miles were gorgeous, nearly flat and roving around creeks and streams through rhododendron tunnels. I sped over them, now wanting to go one shelter further along because 1) I like slug and Brit and that's where they were headed 2) i passed my first shelter option at 3 o'clock and 3) the Boy Scouts were staying at my first shelter option. After one final push up Walnut Mountain, the shelter was there. It's quite small but comfortable, and conveniently right on the trail. I was the first to arrive. Brit came spin after, while Slug stuck around on the peak to take artsy photos. Soon, Ken showed up, an older hiker also from Standing Bear, as did Clean Skittle (who accidentally left a bag of skittles in his pants in the laundry) and Bolt. We had a lovely time at dinner, lots of fun. Lots of laughs. It started getting really cold. This is probably going to be the coldest night yet for me. Brit has Jerry-rigged his tarp across the shelter entrance to keep the warmth in. I'm wearing all my clothes essentially. But I'll survive. Tomorrow into Hot Springs!","Standing Bear Farm

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524548,"Brrrr. Last night was probably the coldest I've spent in my life. I love my sleeping bag a lot, but last night was the first time it truly wasn't warm enough. I was wearing two shirts, a down jacket, raincoat, hat, leggings, shorts, rain pants and two pairs of socks, and still I was shivering. It took me forever to even get to sleep, let alone stay asleep. I found the only way I stayed warm enough was to lay on my front, a very unnatural sleeping position for me; I woke up with my clothing bag (which I use as a pillow) covered in drool. Fortunately I made it through the night without having to boil water and keep a warm bottle in my sleeping bag or do jumping jacks. These were the thoughts I was having while I struggled to fall asleep. Ken was packing up and Brit hadn't even moved yet. With all my clothes on, I was more impervious to the chilly morning than I had been before, so I wasn't particularly cold eating breakfast and packing up. Trying to bite into my clif bar was a challenge, though. It was like a peanut butter popsicle. Bolt headed out just before me. I left with my raincoat on and took it off and put it on probably about five times over the course of the next hour as the terrain changed and the sun came out. There was only one real climb all day, and it was early, and not very challenging. As Bolt and I descended away from bluff mountain, the snow around us slowly gave way to pine needles and leaves again. I hit one major personal milestone today right about at Garenflo Gap: this has officially become my longest-mileage backpacking trip ever! Just as I passed the gap, I exceeded the 275 miles that I travelled last summer on Vermont's Long Trail, and in a day and a half less of hiking, I might add. I thought quite a bit about my Long Trail hike after passing Garenflo. The Long Trail is tougher than the AT has been so far, no doubt; the trails are cut so much more sharply and the maintenance is so much inferior on the LT. The Long Trail also seemed to take a lot longer than I've spent so far on the AT. I think with each day's hike being such a larger percentage of the trail, every day is imbued with more meaning. There was barely any middle ground between me still filled with wonder and amazement trying to figure it all out and me being nearly completed with the trail. Each day on the AT is barely a dent in the 2200 mile total, and the days seemed to have passed quicker. So much of my Long Trail hike was spent alone. I love having other people around me, ahead of me to catch up to, behind me to see when I take a zero, to talk things over and make jokes, tell stories and just see familiar faces. Everyone says it, but seriously. The people are making this trail experience so much richer for me. Tomorrow I'll hit 20 days, the length of time I actually took to complete the Long Trail. The terrain down here has been significantly easier, but I've also been feeling like I have more in the tank at the end of each day out here than on the Long Trail. I leave camp at 8, arrive at 5, and still feel like a human being. I'm thinking that my mileage is going to keep being consistently between 18-20 for the next week of so and may begin to exceed that once I hit Virginia. That would put me on track to complete the trail in just over 4 months. We'll see. I bounced over a few ups and downs and stopped briefly at Deer Park Mountain Gap before beginning the final descent into Hot Springs. The trail had the town in view for quite some time before reaching it. The valley of the French Broad River, which is only about wide enough for a railroad and highway, widens here into green pastures between two hulking mountain ridges. The town is tiny, laid out entirely along one street, Bridge Street, on which the AT passes. I paused where the first trail hits the town where a bulletin board featured an adorable note from an elementary school child about what to bring on an AT hike. He suggested fleece pants and ""maybe even a picture of your family if you are going to be gone for a while."" I stepped out on to the sidewalk and made my way towards town and the Sunnybank Inn where I planned to spend the night. Astoundingly, the first person I saw was Andrew, whom I haven't seen since literally Day 1. Chickenfoot, as he's now been dubbed, is doing the AT like no one else; he's taken five zero days to my two and is still in the same place. He cruises over the mountains but just loves hanging out in town. I was amazed to see him. He must have been right behind or ahead of me essentially my whole hike without our ever crossing paths. Without a sign or anything, it took me a minute to find the Sunnybank Inn, but soon I laid my things outside the door of an old Victorian-looking house and stepped inside as the sign bade me. I was met by Greg, a former thru hiker, who showed me around. The house was built in the mid-1800s and is wonderfully labyrinthine and ornate, with original fixtures and lots of cluttered art. It was built back when Hot Springs was a resort town where people would come to relax or to take health benefits from the ""waters."" My room (which I have to myself) has a queen bed and a ton of space, as well as a private bathroom. I was not expecting this for 20 bucks. It's an extremely cool house. Judge popped out just as I was settling in, and I said hello. I took a quick rinse in the ""50-year old shower as opposed to the 100-year old shower,"" as Greg put it, and then headed to the tavern for lunch. There I met Clean Skittle, who had just polished off the AT hiker burger, which I promptly ordered. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. It was three huge patties each covered in bacon and cheese. I got through about half and decided to wrap the rest up. I had been defeated. Next, I headed to the Post Office, where I hoped a care package sent by Debbie Hallbach, my girlfriend's mother, would be waiting for me. Once again, general delivery did not fail me, and I was soon ripping into the package. I'm so glad I opened it before I went shopping: she sent me enough snacks and chocolate for the next week, including peanut butter M&Ms, for which I have a soft spot! Seriously, Debbie, I can't thank you enough! It was so wonderful to have this present waiting for me, it was like Christmas! I went to the Dollar General and then to the local outfitter to do the rest of my shopping. Everything is on the same two blocks, including Sunnybank and the tavern. The outfitter has just about everything a hiker could possibly want, and they also happened to have a set of Black Diamond pole tips, just like the ones I had just had shipped to my home in Connecticut for free from a warranty claim. I was expecting a much higher price, but these tips only cost 11 bucks! I figured I might as well just replace them now for that cheap. I also picked up a pair of Dirty Girl Gaiters that I've been waiting to buy here, as well as some more Aquamira drops. I also did my laundry. Also across the street. Seriously. This town is tiny and has exactly what I needed. In the laundromat I found Slug, who lent me a dollar for quarters. He was about to head up to Sunnybank and see if they had any rooms left, which I'm sure they did. The man at the outfitter said he would help me remove the current tips of my poles that have been wearing down for weeks now, but I didn't note that the outfitter closed at 5, and I was too late when I returned with my poles. I looked on the internet and found that the trick seems to be to put the tips in boiling water to loosen the adhesive. I was surprised that there was no cast-and-die screwing involved. A project for later.I returned to the tavern and had a beer with Judge, who explained to me that Curve, Rabbit and Kings Arthur and Scum took a zero at Davenport Gap Shelter to wait out the snowstorm, and so are only today passing Standing Bear. I can't imagine how dreary a zero there must have been: it's a smaller shelter without the awning of all the others in the Smokies, and it has a chainlink fence across the front, a legacy from when all Smokies shelters had them. I hung around for quite a while there, facetimed Ali, switched my laundry.... Eventually Slug showed up and Judge left to check out the live music at the OTHER restaurant in town. I know. Slug and I talked for quite a while and soon other folks showed up; Bolt, Brit and Clean Skittle are all staying up at Laughing Heart Lodge. Still feeling full from lunch, I ordered a big house salad and relished all the fresh veggies. I nearly forgot my laundry and ran over to the laundromat. Judge came back and another two hikers I've seen but not met - Quick and AK - joined us. Slug once again expressed his distaste for the ""Boy Scouts,"" whom we are pretty sure aren't Boy Scouts. We all had beers and caught up and joked around until about 9:30, when I left. I headed back to the Inn and decided it was time to boil my poles. Elmer, the guy who owns the place, wouldn't let me use any of his pots for the purpose, but I found one in the hiker box that would do just fine. I soaked the tips in the water til it came to a boil, grabbed some paper towels and POP! Both tips slid right off. I was a bit discouraged to see that I had not only been eating into the tip of the pole, but also into the lower shaft of the pole itself; it meant that the bond with the new tips wouldn't be as strong as it could be if they weren't sheared off. But I popped the new tips on and pressed them down into the ground as hard as I could. They aren't quite as deeply on there as the previous ones, but I think they'll get the job done. And hey, if they come off, it's only ten bucks for a new set. With that, I retired to my room for the night, where I packed up my food bag and my laundry and got ready for bed! Most of the folks I was with are zeroing here tomorrow, but I'll grab the breakfast here (which has a big thumbs up from judge) and then head out, and make it as many miles as I feel like. I'll try to make it 70 miles to Erwin, the next resupply, in four days. Should be very doable. Gnight!","Walnut Mountain Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524685,"Slept like a dream last night in my queen bed, but as usual couldn't manage to sleep in at all. I was up around 7 though I really didn't have much to do until breakfast at 8:30. I packed up and ran across to the dollar general to pick up some more contact solution, of which I'm nearly out. Breakfast at Sunnybank was impressive! This morning I ate two homemade waffles with strawberries and real maple syrup, a bowl of granola and yogurt, two pieces of cantaloupe and a lovely spicy vegetable medley. I mean, I don't know if it compares to the crumbly pop tarts I've been eating every morning, but for six bucks, it was pretty damn good. The topic of the morning was bear attacks, apparently, one subject I dont contribute much to. Almost everyone I was with yesterday is zeroing, except for Judge, but he wants to take it easy and only do 11 miles today. Right as breakfast was wrapping up, Magic of all people walked in! I hope I see him again soon. It took me quite a while to leave Hot Springs. I had to repack my bag, run to the other side of town for an ATM because they didn't take card, try the other ATM because the first didn't work, come back, hang outside the public library to use their wifi to update my journal and text my parents, and only then did I finally walk down Bridge Street with my pack on ready to leave. It was after 10 by the time I started officially walking. I'm almost sorry I didn't zero there. It's a place I could see myself spending a week at. I really loved my time in Hot Springs. The trail crossed the river on the automobile bridge and then hopped the guardrail down the river's edge, which it followed for probably half a mile before switch backing up the ridge I had just been hiking below, and hit a number of impressive rock outcroppings with gorgeous views of the town. I wish I could bottle up how I felt this morning. Something about the perfect weather, the trail and my time in Hot Springs combined to make me feel like I was the luckiest man in the world to be doing what I'm doing right now. I know some people resent when the trail hits roads, or sees signs of civilization, but I've come to like road crossings and the like. Today the trail followed a gravel road next to a pond and through a gorgeous meadow before splitting off again. I made the hike up Rich Mountain and did the extra side trail to the tower. It was ehh, the least exciting one we've seen yet. I ate lunch up there and met Tesla and Grits, a couple hiking the trail together. The afternoon passed uneventfully. The trail became the border of a prescribed burn area for about 7 miles, which was strange and spooky. It was good to have tips back on my poles. My pack was heavy and a few short sections of the climbs up to Little Laurel Shelter were seriously steep! This was one of my latest arrivals, about 6:20, but considering I started 90 minutes or two hours after I normally do, it wasn't an above average day. Already at the shelter were two older gentlemen, Ghost (who is from Rutland VT) and Fast Eddy, who has a big gray beard, a voice shot from smoking and a real cowboy hat, as well as Bang Bang , whom I met earlier, who is travelling with two other hikers, Moonshine and Doubtfire, who together are working to make a documentary about the trail! Their bags apparently each weigh 60 pounds because of their camera equipment. They are also vegan. Two challenges I am glad not to have on the trail. The older folks turned in and I spoke to the three filmmakers as they made dinner. The tent spots did not appeal to me and Bang Bang is the only other one in the shelter, so I'm sheltering. Again. Jeez, I haven't set up my tent since frickin Standing Indian Mountain. Today marks 20 days on the trail, making this now the longest time I've spent backpacking! It was funny, someone asked me this morning how my hike was going, and I didn't know whether he meant this morning or in all, but my unconscious and immediate answer was a resounding ""Wonderful!"" Seriously. It's been a great time so far. It's amazing to me also that some people have now been out here for almost twice as long as I have. I move pretty quick, comparatively, and I'm still probably gonna get stronger and lose more weight. Tomorrow should continue the set of around 20-mile days. I'll have some beautiful views in the morning, it looks like, and I'll hit the 300-Mile mark! Gnight!","Sunnybank Inn, Hot Springs, NC
",Little Laurel Shelter,"Mar 23, Wed",19.60
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524744,"I woke up rather late this morning, with the sun already pouring in. I was surprised to see a giant sleeping bag that wasn't there when I arrived. I learned quickly that it held Tesla and Grits, whom I was sure weren't going to make it here last night. Bang Bang slept on as I packed up and broke camp. I left by about 8:30. I was considering trying to make it 22 miles to Hogback Ridge Shelter: the elevation profile looked extremely tame except for the first climb in the morning and the last climb at the end of the day. The trail had different ideas. The wind howled all day long from the South. Switchbacks be damned! The climb up to Camp Creek Bald went straight up the mountain, tough as can be, and my pack felt extremely heavy for some reason. After this climb was done, the trail putzed around a place called Jones Meadow, where who should I find lounging in his tent but Andrew, aka Chickenfoot. He apparently spent all morning and into the afternoon in Hot Springs and was planning to hike ""deep into the night but my knee gave out so I stopped here at 12:30 (AM)"". Hike your own hike. But I do NOT understand his hiking habits at ALL. The trail then headed over Big Firescald Knob, where a bad weather bypass cuts right below the trail for a mile and a half. I am getting that the bypass was the old AT and they cut a new trail to make it more challenging and give some views. The guide called the stretch ""rocky and strenuous,"" but I was skeptical, looking at the unimposing profile. Doooowee. The trail here kicked my ASS. It was rock staircases up and down and the profile couldn't quite get across the sudden leaps and drops that make the section hard. It took me about halfway to forever to finish the section and I felt drained having gone through it. To make things worse, I stumbled and got a huge prickly vine suck between my legs and lacerated the back of my left thigh and the front of my right. I was in just a pissy mood for the rest of the morning, and I wasn't going nearly as fast as I'd wanted. The trail improved over the course of the day. It became graded more nicely (with a few exceptions) and after Jerry Cabin Shelter passed through some lovely bald meadows that are probably my favorite stretch of trail so far. But I just felt off and foul. And worse, rain had suddenly become predicted for about 4:30, and I knew I couldn't risk a late arrival to Hogback in a thunderstorm. Plus, i definitely didn't have the energy for a 22-mile day. So I considered my options. I sat for a very long time next to a tree in Flint Gap and read the AWOL guide. I could find a campsite somewhere up on the hill before the shelter, but I didn't feel like camping (somewhere) in the rain. Then there was a hostel at Devil's Fork Gap, about 16 miles into my day, that looked promising. A market and restaurant with bunks and a shower, essentially. So that was the plan. Then I got to Flint Mountain Shelter, where a piece of paper advertised ""FOUR MILES NORTH OF HERE, A NEW HOSTEL, HIKER PARADISE! PIZZAS! MATTRESSES!"" I wrote down their number and as soon as I had reception, called them up. I received not the proprietor on the line but instead another hiker who introduced himself as Options and said that he arrived 20 minutes ago and it looked rather nice, especially for the 15 bucks he was quoted as a price for the night of stay. I kept that in mind, but was still leaning towards Laurel Trading Post, the first hostel. The trail descended easily towards Devils Fork Gap and I had reception the whole time, and I planned to call Laurel Trading Post for a pickup at the trailhead, because the store is almost 3 miles down the road. But when i got there. Suddenly, no reception. I thought I might hitch a ride, but the road was very sleepy in my direction. So I sat down on a stile that climbed a barbed wire fence and once again considered my options. I could hike back up til I had reception and then wait however long it took for a shuttle to come find me. Or I could push on a half mile and go to Hiker Paradise, a hostel I know essentially nothing about, which is only a half mile off the trail. I decided to keep going. The last half mile was easy, but the road walk to the hostel was loooong. I was expecting a house with an attached garage or something, but what the hostel is a very recently-built shack/building with everything hikers need in about a 25 by 25 foot space. It has a gravel floor, three sets of three bunks, a TV, picnic table and chairs, and a separate floored area with a very, well let's say cozy, shower and toilet room, and a hiker fridge and a huge resupply shelf. Four older hikers were already here, including Ghost whom I'd met last night. They joked that I was crashing the AARP meeting. I set my things down, with still no sign of the owner. I soon met George, who is the owner's ten year old son, and seems sugar-crazed and starved for attention. He was cute and fast-talking and would've been just fine company if he hadn't been bugging everybody about their phones, if they had any games, any chocolate or any knives. When I told him I was carrying my old iPhone, he unabashedly asked if he could have it, as he did with a few other of my possessions. Soon, Jerry, the owner came in. He's apparently been working on the building for a few years, but only opened for business on March 1. I told him as soon as he advertises in the AWOL guide, he'll be packed every night, and he said he was grateful not to be packed while he's still working out the kinks. We hung out and ate dinner (I passed on the frozen pizza in order to lighten my food bag a little). I took a shower and did what laundry I had. Despite having good wifi, i wasn't able to FaceTime with Ali, which made me pretty sad. It's been a rough day for me for some reason. Everything's just felt kinda off. I'm two days out from Erwin now, going to do 16 miles up to Big Bald tomorrow and then 17 down into Erwin the next day, hopefully. Here's hoping I feel better in the morning.","Little Laurel Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524921,"The lights were on early at Hiker Paradise. Happens when you've got older guys staying at the hostel. They don't like to sleep in as much as people my age. A few of the guys bought biscuits and gravy from the resupply at the hostel for breakfast, but I wanted to get rid of pack weight, so pop tarts and protein bars it was for me. Jerry did make us all free hash browns, though, which was nice of him. Jim once again joked that the hash browns were only for AARP members. Jerry and I chatted a bit. This was the second time he's had five people since opening on the first of March. He says he likes hosting the older guys ""because they go to bed earlier. And they're less demanding of beer."" I gave him the idea of getting surge protectors or splitters for the outlets, as hikers always need recharges. Jerry shuttled the three other guys back to the trailhead at about 8:30, and Ghost and I waited for his return. We watched George play more Need for Speed on the Xbox. It seems sort of rude to say, but the biggest change Jerry needs to make to the hostel is to get George out of the equation. When hikers get to a hostel, they want to sit and have silence, mostly. And George is a ten year old boy. Which means he's loud and inquisitive and a handful. Hikers can't be bothered to entertain a child at a hostel, especially when we're paying for stay. Anyways. Ghost and I were on the trail by about 8:45. The weather was supposed to get nice later but the morning began foggy, humid and chilly. The day started with a climb up Lick Rock, which was pretty serious, but I cruised up it pretty fast, passing Ghost and the other three pretty soon. The fog made me focus on the short stretch of trail in front of me. And I think having a more full breakfast helped too. I need to start eating more at breakfast. The top of Lick Rock was a more overgrown bald than we've seen and the fog gave it an eerie look, like a Scottish moor. The next section was short climbs and descents for quite some time, a type of hiking that I actually very much enjoy. I ran into Andrew, aka Chickenfoot, just at the turnoff for Hogback Ridgr Shelter, where I had thought about staying last night (thank god I did not do that). Yesterday kicked his ass, too, he said. I pushed on ahead of him for the moment and made my way down to Sam's Gap. Right before the highway at a little break area with logs and a fire pit, I saw a hiker and said hello, and he wished me good morning back and said he was taking a short break. Then I noticed the pistol laying on the log next to him. Aaand the camo pants and backpack. I pushed on without a word, but I'd been told about this hiker back at Mt. Collins shelter. He goes by Skeebo and apparently brandishes his gun whenever he can. He claims to be a veteran, and may well be, but apparently, according to the ex-army guy I met at Mt. Collins, he cannot possibly have been at about half the places he says he was. As Andrew noted when he passed me and I told him to be wary of Skeebo, he cannot possibly have a license for the weapon in every single state the trail goes through. And jeezis, who ""takes a break"" and decides to take out his pistol instead of, ya know, snacks, or water. I had half a mind to call the police just to check his permit or something. Apparently he made himself quite a nuisance in the smokies. The next part of the day was spent all in climbing towards Big Bald, the highest point between Hot Springs and Erwin. I could see it from quite far away. The trail climbed along a single ridge the whole time, essentially. The trail was graded such that there were only two modes of hiking: basically flat and darn steep. Andrew and I leapfrogged a few times, but he pulled ahead of me. He wants to hike all the way to Erwin tonight and get there at like 10 pm. Again. I do not understand. The last push up Big Bald was tough, but he payoff was great. I was soon standing in a meadow of straw-colored grass mounds, and pushing towards the top of the peak. Andrew was there, as were a couple, day hiking. It was lovely and warm and bright, and I lay in the sun for quite some time just relaxing. What I had planned to do yesterday was just to make it another mile and a bit to Bald Mountain Shelter. Soon I was alone up on the bald and I sang ""Soak up the Sun"" and danced around. A few other hikers showed up as I was lying down, two thru hikers and their two friends who joined them in Hot Springs. The thru hikers names are Jeremy and Mara. Apparently they don't have trail names yet. I took their picture and hung out a little longer before making my way across and down the bald. I stopped in at the shelter and signed the log before deciding to move on 3.5 more miles to the next campground. It was all downhill with the exception of a short jump up Little Bald, and soon I found myself in Whistling Gap. I was alone. The water source here is pretty dire, just a tiny trickle that lets out into a small pool into which you can dip a bottle, but I caught a lot of debris in mine. I had to wait for the silt to settle before getting any water. Anyway. I set up my tent and cooked dinner and hung a best bag and began to journal in my tent. Ghost came by around 7 pm and said he was heading on to Spivey gap, a few miles on. A late night for him, too. Soon, three other hikers showed up: two younger hikers, Wee Gillis and his Dutch friend whose name I forget, aaaand Skeebo. I hung around with them as they cooked. Skeebo I believe has a stove, but he is trying to save on fuel and built a fire to cook on, something I haven't seen yet. He seems alright in person but I am still weirded out by him. He tells a lot of stories that don't sound true. The two youngins are friends from an international school in New Mexico, but one lives five minute from Devil's Fork Gap. I turned in as they finished up cooking.","Hiker Paradise, via Rector Laurel Road

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525003,"I'm not sure what Skeebo was doing at 3 in the morning but he decided to light a fire and woke me up with his cracking sticks. Whatever. He also sleeps in a full snowsuit instead of a sleeping bag. Jeez he's weird. Anyways. I packed up quick as I can trying to get to Erwin nice and early. The boys were still cooking meals when I headed out around 8:15. The first part of the day was a climb up High Rocks, which had a .1 side trail to a peak. I took it and was disappointed when it basically had no view. I climbed down and was mildly annoyed when the AT decided to climb more right under the summit I just took a side trail to. The trail dropped down to Spivey Gap, where I'm sorry I didn't camp. There were a few lovely tent sites and a large creek that sure as hell beat the dribble at Whistling Gap. Ghost apparently got here yesterday night. I spose I've been overestimating the time it takes me to do things in camp. A 6 o'clock arrival is not entirely crazy when you're prepared to set up a tent rather than snag a space in a shelter. I met a couple of day hikers sectioning into Erwin at the gap and made my way up the only serious climb of the day. It followed a gorgeous creek before flattening out into a classic NC/TN follow the contour of the mountain type flat trail after a mile or so. The hiking was pretty easy, and I wanted to get into town, and I moved pretty quick. The trail moved up to Temple Hill Ridge, where I thought it'd be just downhill into Erwin all the way. No such luck. The ridge trail took me over every bump it could, but finally I was switch backing down to Erwin. I put on music, then decided to plug in my earbuds for the first time on the trail (new ones I picked up in Asheville). I also met a hiker who is finishing up a Southbound hike he began last summer. I've seen a couple of them so far. Jeez. I can't imagine committing eight months or more to this trail. From the ridge I could see the Nolichucky River and Erwin from very far away. It's amazing to me just how long it takes to drop the thousands of feet down into town; maybe it's most amazing how high up I am in the first place. After one and a half Sufjan Stevens albums, I made it down to the road, and a block away I found Uncle Johnny's Hostel. I was immediately welcomed in by the owner - Johnny - who has been running the place for almost forty years. He's clearly getting on, but has a way with hikers. He knows what they need. I immediately helped myself to a can of Dr Pepper from the vending machine and met Red Bear, who is hanging around Erwin all day and planning to night hike out. Another thing I am not familiar with. I had arrived around 1:30, too late for the afternoon shuttle to the all-you-can-eat pizza buffet and Dollar General. But I must have made some rumblings about lunch, because Jeff, another hostel employee, offered to drive me somewhere to get lunch together. I hopped in his truck and we settled on McDonalds. I had seen that Erwin was a long town, but I wasn't prepared for the reality of it. It's spread across four interstate exits in a valley along the Nolichucky River. McDonalds found itself on the way northern side of town, opposite from Uncle Johnny's. I ordered a Mcdouble and twenty McNuggets, and nearly ordered more before realizing that it was nearly 2:30 and there was still dinner to be had. Jeff drove me back and I ate my delicious lunch on the hostel deck as a number of other hikers prepared to set out after the morning spent in Erwin. I decided to spend the night here and settled up with Johnny and bought some freeze dried meals in his outfitter shop. I'm imagining that I'll do a similar four day, 70-mile stint into Hampton, TN out of here and then pick up a few days' worth of food there to get to Damascus in about two and a half days. II set out my tent to dry, because it was damp after last night with all the humidity in the air, and then took a shower and threw in some laundry with Ghost, who is also here after his short day from Spivey. I met Ribbit and Goose, two friends just out of college from Georgia hiking together, and the Roman Noodles, an older couple who've already done quite a bit of backpacking and mountaineering, including hiking Kilimanjaro. Wee Gillis and the Dutchman showed up, but decided to just hitch into town. Wee Gillis' mother is coming to pick them up later, as it is only a 20/30 minute drive from Devils Fork Gap to Erwin. I spose that I might have a similar situation happening when I get to eastern New York and the Kent area in Connecticut. Sounds great to me. Eventually it was time to head to dinner. We all piled into the van, and headed to a local Mexican restaurant where the staff had set up a 10-person table for us already. I imagine that Johnny and the gang of hikers are here most nights of the week and are a known quantity. I had chicken fajitas and a margarita, then paid my bill and headed to Walmart next door, where the van would pick us up in an hour. I got my groceries for the next stint of trail (as well as some beer for tonight) and checked out, and soon was back at the hostel. I facetimed for quite a while with Ali, and hung out with the Noodles and Ribbit and Goose. Red Bear, Doctor trails and Jeff and a few others were having a party out on the deck. I got my things a bit more organized for heading out tomorrow, and then headed to my bunk for the night. Tomorrow will all be spent in approaching the Roan Highlands, one of the highlights of the South, full of huge Balds, wild ponies, and the last time the trail hits 6000 feet before New Hampshire. I'm not sure how far I'll get, but I'll try to do a long day. I would LOVE to stay at Overmountain Shelter (aka the Barn) two nights from now, but that's 42 miles away, and I'm not sure whether I'll be able to push that much in just two days, especially with the weather being iffy as it's supposed to for the next couple days. No amount of planning is going to be able to tell me how many miles I'll feel like doing. So we'll just have to wait and see. Gnight!","Whistling Gap

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525160,"Happy Easter, everybody!Ghost was out crazy early this morning but the rest of us got up and shuffled about around 7:30. I packed up and got ready. It's always tough to get out of a hostel. Too much moving from place to place, too many things far away. The roman noodles and Ribbit and Goose waited around for the breakfast shuttle that would take them to Huddle House (apparently just like Waffle House) at 8:30, but I just ate my pop tart and protein bar and got ready to head out. I was on the road just before 8:30. The trail out of Erwin was pretty easy. I thought to myself that it would have made a lot of sense to hike out last night a few miles to cut down into my day today, as I was considering making it all the way to Greasy Creek Hostel, 24 miles away. The day was overcast and cool, nice hiking if you ask me. It got quite foggy up high, though, which detracted from any views I would've had. The only place I feel I missed out on was called the Beauty Spot, but I enjoyed the meadow just the same. I met up with Red Bear at Indian Grave Gap, but pushed on ahead of him. Today was the first day I really noticed my physical abilities having changed. I am able to make it up climbs faster and easier than I could've possibly imagined at the start of this trip. I've also lost almost 20 pounds of the scales at the hostels I've been staying at have been correct. The only real big climb today was Unaka Mountain, and having climbed up most of the way without a break, I decided it would be a challenge to myself to make it up and over without stopping. I did it just about no problem! It was a neat hike, the top was full of evergreens and one area of very old evergreen growth was wonderfully spooky. At the gap after Unaka I met Klaus, an Austrian man and his husky, Nanook. I asked him, ""oh, like Nanook of the North?"" To which he gave me a puzzled look and said ""yes, it's a Nordic name...."" I ran into Ghost and made it up to Cherry Gap Shelter, where I knew I at least wanted to make it today. Ghost and I sat around for a while and I rested before deciding I was prepared to push on 7 more miles to Greasy Creek, and do the most walking I've ever done in a single day. It was just about 3 o'clock and Ghost didn't look ready to quit either, and the next 7 miles didn't look too intimidating. I pushed off betting that Ghost would be close behind me. I also put on some Nickel Creek, the second time now I've actually used earbuds to listen to music on the trail. It occupies my mind for the somewhat monotonous miles. The last 7 miles weren't tough per se but they weren't easy. There were a few pretty brutal climbs near the end, and with rain sprinkling on me a few times, I was freaking out a little bit. As I came over the final crest before the gap I desperately tried to get reception to call the hostel for a pickup at the gap, only to be told a few minutes later that there is no road, only a half mile woods trail from the hostel up to the AT. The woods road down to the hostel made me appreciate just how much goes into good trail maintenance. Though the road was wide and flat, it had countless problems for hikers: piles of leaves that harbor loose rocks ready to twist an ankle, drainage issues that make the whole road a trail of mud. It felt like quite a bit more than a half mile down, but I was going slower than I do on the trail. Finally, a few houses started showing up, and I found the one with the Greasy Creek Friendly sign on it. It was about 6 (my previous record of 22 miles had taken me 12 hours, but it was also over far tougher terrain). I was met outside by the crew of hikers who left Uncle Johnny's yesterday afternoon, including Rain Man and Doctor Trails. They had stopped in for ice cream. I wonder if they looked in to see if it was worth the stay, because if it truly was just for ice cream I can't imagine walking .6 miles steeply downhill then uphill. Anyways. I was showed in by CeeCee, the owner, who is extremely talkative and meticulous (she credits both to formerly being a dental hygienist). I decided that the bunkhouse looked worth the 10 bucks for stay, and then took a shower and hung around. I talked with Highland Dave, a strange older hiker who just took a zero here. The only other thru hiker here is Oat, a very soft-spoken man from Tallahassee. Soon enough the hostel received a call, and I recognized the voice as Ghost's. He was asking for a pickup just like I did and was similarly disappointed. He pulled in a few minutes later. I cooked a Mountain House (using water boiled in a microwave, imagine that) and had a few sodas. The Ben and Jerry's in the freezer looked tempting, but my very mild lactose intolerance is set off worst by ice cream, so I thought better than it. I facetimed with Ali for quite a while and watched most of the Incredibles, which Dave had playing on the TV. CeeCee out everyone's laundry into one big load and showed me as a joke the result of the immediate submerging: water brown as mud. Gross. After a little more FaceTime, it was bedtime. I wanted to push myself today for a few reasons: I wanted to see whether I could do it; I wanted to get a jumpstart on this 76 mile section to Hampton, and now I have three reasonable 17 and 18 mile days in front of me. I think I'll try to stay at Kincora hostel when I get there. Jeez I've been making the grand tour of the NC/TN hostels this past week. Mostly I wanted to push so I could stay at Overmountain Shelter tomorrow. It is a converted barn that can sleep more than twenty people, and I've wanted to stay there since learning about the trail. I didn't think I could do it, but now it looks like tomorrow I'll make the climbs up to Roan high knob and then cruise down to the shelter!","Uncle Johnny's, Erwin, TN

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525280,"I was so thankful to be indoors - not just in a shelter but indoors - last night. I woke up at one point and the storm was raging and the drops on the roof were thunderous. The bunk room has no windows so I was able to sleep later than usual, about 7:45. Then Oat and I turned on the light and began getting our things together. He's been having foot problems and is taking a zero today. Unfortunately, he needs new shoes and unlike at other hostels, going into town is extremely difficult. He is probably going to be here a few days. CeeCee offered to make us all free grits, and I readily accepted. She put butter and salt and pepper on them. It was wonderful to start with a hot breakfast. I also forced myself to eat a pop tart and clif bar. I find that I am not very hungry at all in the mornings, but I know that the more I eat in the morning the better time I'll have. Ghost headed out a few minutes before me. I got all my things together and got a big hug from CeeCee (for someone so concerned about getting norovirus, she hugs a lot). She's kinda crazy. She wished me ""a splendid butterfly day. No rain, because butterflies can't fly in the rain."" I headed out and struggled up the woods road back up to Greasy Creek Gap. The miles after the gap were all very easy up and over Little Rock Knob. I passed ghost, who Was planning to stay at Roan High Knob shelter. I then found myself at Hughes Gap, had a snack, and started up the long hike up Roan High Knob. The fog had been clinging around the mountains all morning and it disappeared in front of me as I was climbing. The trail switchbacked over a single ridge probably about 40 times, it wasn't hard climbing but it was really long. Finally, I came out under blue skies at the site of the former Cloudland Resort, above 6000 feet for the last time until New Hampshire. The wind was blowing and made me pretty cold. I walked the short distance over to Roan High Knob Shelter. It was a bluebird day, but the wind was rushing and it was freezing. At the shelter were the crew I'd met at Uncle Johnny's, frost, rain man, seal tree, Doctor trails and Blaze. They'd come up from an earlier shelter and were also headed to the Barn, aka Overmountain Shelter, just over 7 miles away. I ate my lunch as they headed out and then headed down the mountain.I passed a day hiking couple and she asked me if I was a thru hiker. When I said yes, she dug around in her bag and pulled out a Reese's Egg and wished me a happy Easter! This was very funny to me as I had just been talking about Reese's Eggs with Ali last night. I made my way down to Carvers Gap, where the trees gave way to a giant grassy bald area. I made my way starting up Round Bald, and soon was greeted with just about the most spectacular view I've ever seen. The Roan Highlands are just a huge ridge of earth plunked down among other mountain ridges, but the Roan Highlands dwarf their surroundings. It was clear as could be and I could see forever away to the north and south. The Balds are just otherworldly, astounding places to hike. I took my time over the couple of mountains, knowing that it would be a long time before I would be back, and this was a special place. There were a number of groups of day hikers here, but they all hung around the summit of Round Bald. Past that, it was me and the mountains. Soon enough I was descending off of them down towards yellow mountain gap and Overmountain Shelter. Then I heard a little ""pop."" A piece of the front toe cap on my right boot debonded quite a long time ago, and there's been no change since. But it must've snagged something because the entire thing just kind of fell off, and my boot was suddenly a few layers of gore Tex and a loose piece of plastic. I tried to hike on it a little, but I felt like I was just doing more damage to the boot, so I took it off and put on my right croc, and hiked unevenly for the last 2.5 miles of the day. My parents were soon on the case, and I should have another pair of boots waiting for me at Kincora hostel when I get there on Wednesday afternoon. Soon enough I found myself at the side trail to Overmountain, which led down to a grassy knoll with a spectacular view and the giant red barn I've seen so many times in pictures. It's just a gorgeous place for a shelter, and this barn is no ordinary shelter, with bunks for about 10 on the lower floor and then a loft that could easily hold 20 hikers. The gang from Roan High Knob was here, as were five hikers who did the PCT last year out for a short reunion hike. I threw my stuff upstairs and hung around before cooking dinner. I really like the company of frost and rain man. Seal tree and Blaze had a long conversation about politics that bordered on conspiracy theories. Me frost and rain man all stayed quiet and then commiserated when blaze and seal tree left. I made myself some hot fruit punch because we could all tell the night to come was going to be a cooold one.","Greasy Creek Friendly Hostel

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525608,"Boy was it cold again last night. I prepared better than I have for any night in the cold: all my warm clothes were on, I drank a lot of hot liquid before bed and did a few sets of jumping jacks before getting into my sleeping bag. And I supposed it probably helped for the beginning. But I tossed and turned later in the night trying to get warm. Again, the warmest position seemed to be on my stomach, but I wasn't particularly happy. I slept til about 7:45 and got up with the morning light pouring through the slats in the barn walls. Ghost was long gone, as were Blaze and Dr. Trails. Ghost was planning on meeting some college buddies at the Mtn Harbor Hostel, whereas the other two wanted to put in a 28 mile day and have a very easy time getting to Hampton in the morning. I packed up all my stuff and was gone by about 8:30, as usual. The morning hike was tough. The Balds were absolutely astounding, just like yesterday. The views were spectacular, I had clear visibility for as many miles as I could comprehend. But the wind was howling. It was blowing consistently at probably 20 miles an hour and gusting way higher. My backpack hung off kilter, and multiple times, I got blown off the trail. It didn't help that the trail was muddy and slick. The wind died down in the few patches of woods on the Balds, but most of the hiking I was stuck between feeling amazed by my surroundings and absolutely crushed by the weather. Seal tree passed me and I paced him up Hump Mountain, probably the longest bald hike we've done yet on the trail. We passed rock outcroppings and fences and the wind bowled us over as we clambered up the steep trail through the brown grass mounds of the bald. The wind for some reason was lowest up at the top of mountain, probably because of a stand of trees that appeared under the northern side of the ridge. The view was gorgeous back over to the Balds where we've been, the mountains of North Carolina to our left, the plains of Middle Tennessee to our right, and ahead, the fields of the towns of Roan Mountain and Hampton. Seal tree pointed out two little figures moving along the trail in the col beneath us, Frost and Rain Man. The hike down was along a very long bald ridge called the Houston Ridge, and was gorgeous hiking. The wind had died down and it was almost warm in the sun (and my rain jacket, hat and gloves). After about 5 miles of being mostly out on the bald, the trail snuck back into the trees. The duct tape repair on my boots was not doing so hot. It had mostly come off on the sides and the top was not long for this world. The trail became a lot of rock jumbles and roots, which was exactly what I didn't need with my sole falling off. Still, it mostly held up, especially when I remembered I had picked up a single rubber band I found back in Hot Springs thinking it would be good for something. It held the front of my boot together most of the day. Soon enough I came upon a sign for Doll Flats, and then past a big field, another sign saying ""Leaving NC!"" After almost 250 miles of crossing back and forth over the NC/TN border, I passed into Tennessee for good. Seal tree was there over the border and we celebrated. I headed down a few more miles to TN 19E, where Ghost would've gotten off for the hostel. The next miles were in and out of civilization, hitting a lot of roads, plowed meadows, right by a church, up a jeep trail, next to a cemetery... It was tougher than I was expecting form the profile. Soon enough I was back in the woods, heading down to Jones Falls, the first in a series of waterfalls along this section of trail. I stopped to admire the stream falling down the ledges, spilling over giant faces of rock. I met Polar Bear, who is making a long day out this morning from the Mtn Harbor Hostel, as well as Zeke, who has done the section to Damascus many times but keeps stopping there, and Ski Slope, a man who fulfills a lot of stereotypes I have had about the south. I will say nothing more. The trail wound down among streams and finally hit an old woods road along the width of the Elk River. It was flat hiking and a very pretty day for it. A couple who were day hiking asked me what trail this was. The question took me sort of by surprise. When you've been following one trail for 400 miles, it just seems silly, but it was an honest question on their parts. I explained to them what the AT was and they wished me luck. I had noticed that I was about to hit the 400 mile mark on the trail. At 100 miles there had been a graffiti sign on Albert mountain, but at 200 or 300 there had been nothing. I had seen pictures before of sticks with the numbers laid on to the ground, and I thought I would've seen them (and considered making them) but had been disappointed. Today, I made a point to be very exact about where I was, and right as I passed the 400 miles mark, I dropped my pack and searched for sticks. Soon I had enough to crudely write ""400!"" on the ground. I took a picture of my handiwork and pushed on the remaining two miles to Mountaineer falls shelter. The falls are nothing to write home about, significantly smaller than Jones falls. Ski Slope was there when I arrived, and I explained to him that the shelter was still ahead and not up the crazy side trail next to the falls. The shelter is lovely, new-looking with two shelves of bunks (plus a small third-floor loft) with a great water source and benches around a big porch area. Polar Bear, a hiker I met earlier in the day, was here having a snack before his 10 mile push to the next shelter, as was Wild Card, a large man with a big gray beard, leggings, poncho and a beret. Ski Slope showed up a minute later, and Zeke was soon after. They met last year on the trail, but Ski Slope is pretty insistent that they were best friends, something that Zeke seems skeptical about. Wild Card made a big fire in order to cook up the hot dogs he had packed in from Erwin, and it was good to sit by the warmth. Frost and Rain Man showed up later than I expected: they had caught a ride into Town and gone to lunch. Frost paid me back with interest for the time I gave him a McNugget at Uncle Johnny's by giving me a fried Oreo from the dessert they'd gotten at lunch. We sat around the fire for a lot of the evening and told stories. Wild Card and Ski Slope played Uno. It's not going to be quite as cold tonight, but it'll be close.","Overmountain Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525609,"Fortunately the weather wasn't as cold as I was expecting last night. I even woke up too hot and had to take off my raincoat. Imagine that. My sleeping bag is a Katabatic Palisade, a quilt with an enclosed foot box: it essentially has no back, so my back has been right on my sleeping pad, and I'm pretty sure that's been where I lose most of my warmth at night. So last night I put down my rain pack cover under my back as an extra layer of rubbery insulation. I think the warmer weather was probably what helped most, but I think the pack cover helped some, too. I knew that new boots were going to be waiting for me at the end of the day, but I still had 16 miles with a blown out sole. I needed something better than duct tape to hold the shoe together and asked, not really expecting anything, if anyone had a rubber band. Rain Man said he thought he did and a minute later handed me the perfect rubber band for the job, wide and durable looking. I thanked him profusely and strapped the band around the shoe. It held pretty well, and lasted me all day, only popping off once. I was out before everyone in the shelter, and moved quickly over the easy miles to Hampton, reaching Moreland Gap shelter 9.6 miles away in just under three hours. A hiker named Stickman stopped me for a bit and asked if he could interview me. After thru hiking a number of years ago, he does a few section hikes each year and interviews thru hikers about their experiences. It took about 2 minutes, and come mid-April I will be part of a YouTube montage of many happy thru-hikers! When I stopped for water just before the last small climb of the day I met Beth, a sobo hiker who began in the Grayson Highlands and will return to start north from there once she reached springer. She has the exact same trippy-looking gaiters as I do. She says she is enjoying the sobo hike so far but says it's hard to just be meeting everybody once. After one more climb, I was at Dennis Cove Road. I knew I had to go to both nearby hostels, one to pick up boots and the other food, and I still wasn't sure I was staying the night, but I started walking up to Kincora first. Kincora is owned by Bob Peoples, a legendary trail maintainer, and does not actually charge, but asks a 5 dollar donation. However, the place is pretty dirty and long in the tooth. I could see my box waiting for me on the porch as I rolled up. I stopped in and saw Doctor Trails, Blaze and Seal Tree, who all stayed the night after a 35-mile day yesterday. Then I opened my box. NEW BOOTS! It was crazy comparing the boots I have worn for 800 miles (including the LT) and thinking that they looked like this when I got them. The used boots were discolored and worn down and squished and pulled in a million places compared to the new ones. The new pair still fit ok, but they'll need some breaking in. I'll be sure to put some extra body glide on my feet for the next few days to try and avoid the blisters. I was thinking that I would just throw the old boots out, but Wolf, who works at Kincora, as well as 10-46, a thru hiker from 2014 doing a section from Hot Springs to Damascus, said that Salomon has a very good return policy for worn-out boots, and that Mount Rogers Outfitters in Damascus would probably replace the boots on the spot if I wore them inside and told them I was a thru hiker and had blown them out on the trail. I think a free new pair of boots is worth carrying my old ones for a few days; I can just ship them home when I'm in Damascus. I hope that all works out and I'm not just carrying worn out dirty boots for no reason. 10-46 wanted some beer and I needed to resupply food, so he and I headed down .7 to Black Bear Resort, the newer, nicer (but not free) hostel/campground on the other side of the AT. It's in a very lovely location along a big creek, and all the little cabins look very nice. I sat for quite a while outside the store trying to picture my next few days. I was considering pushing on 10 more miles tonight and then doing two 20 mile days to Damascus, and I sat for a while hemming and hawing over that possibility before finally examining what would happen if I just stayed the night here. From here I saw I could do an 18, then a pretty easy 22 mile day, then a nearo 10 in to Damascus the next day. Which sounded pretty damn good, considering I would've probably ended up zeroing in Damascus anyway if I'd gone with the previous plan. The next few days' weather are set to be the ugliest stretch I've had so far, so we shall see. I headed in and bought my resupply things (and some beer) from Stephanie, whose parents own th resort and whose kids were playing around in the yard. She was very sweet. I threw all my things in the bunkroom, easily the cleanest bunkroom I've stayed in so far this trip, then headed over to a fire pit where 10-46 was talking to two other hikers. I learned their names - Seeker and Golden Snitch - and shared around my beer. They, as well as another couple I met momentarily, Crumbum and Doodle, had arranged a work for stay deal and had moved and arranged a great deal of mulch earlier in the day, in return for a private cabin for the night, usually 45 dollars each. I ate some lunch, we drank and talked. Eventually I took a nice hot shower and was alerted that a shuttle was leaving for town in ten minutes. I dried off and changed quickly and hopped in with 10-46, seeker and snitch and headed off to Hampton. The road wound down the mountain in tons of switchbacks and the beer was not helping my motion sickness. Seeker and I were both a bit green as we piled out of the van into the dollar general. I bought a few groceries then we all got back in and headed to McDonalds, where we picked up dinner. I briefly facetimed Ali from inside Mickey d's, because I only got reception from town, not up at the resort. We brought our food back to Black Bear and ate it around a little fire that Crumbum and Doodle had made in our absence. Everybody there (10-46 not included) worked mostly as camp counsellors, and we talked a lot about our different camps, the kids, the staff, what we did at night time once the kids were asleep, and the movie Wet Hot American Summer, which every camp counsellor must see. Crumbum and Doodle both worked (and met I believe) at a camp in Minnesota that just has a huge swathe of woodlands to itself. Seeker and Snitch both work at a camp in Maine that seems more similar to Keewaydin. Eventually the conversation turned to an ongoing discussion among Snitch and Seeker of what set of the same animals you would pick in a fight against another set of animals of the same weight, for instance, two 300-pound gorillas versus 5 120-pound German shepherds. We finally agreed to stick to mammals once it became clear that a handful of poisonous bullet ants (crumbum's suggestion) or hornets could bring down just about any huge animal. My pick was just one polar bear, which I think could stand up to just about anything. I got tired before most everyone else and went to journal and get ready for bed in the bunkroom. 10-46 is in here tonight as well. Tomorrow, I'll hope to stay as dry as possible, and will cross Pond Flats and up onto Iron Mountain, the 40 mile ridge that leads from Watauga lake all the way to Damascus.","Mountaineer Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525787,"Woke up at just about the same time as usual after a night of pretty damn good sleep at Black Bear. 10-46 snored some, but earplugs are a great invention. I ate my pop tart and builder bar and settled up for my evening there and resupply. Golden Snitch pulled me into the hiker ""lounge"" where he had pulled up the satellite weather report. The weather across the south was insane from huge hail in Texas to tornadoes in Mississippi. We were just supposed to get some bad thunderstorms at 1. I headed out along the road before anyone else and got back to the trailhead. The trail along the Laurel fork was gorgeous, flat and wide in most places with rock staircases between. At one point the trail even headed right along the rocks next to the water. Laurel Falls was wide and tall and gorgeous with a huge swimming pool. If it were nice out and later in the day I might've taken a swim. It was still nice to look at. The next few miles were all up and down over a mountain called Pond Flats. Looking at the awol guide, the climb makes no sense. 2.5 miles up and 2.5 down, rising and falling almost 2000 feet with no view or point to go to the top. I learned that the trail over pond flats was made as a replacement to a road walk through the town of Hampton. Getting rid of road walks is fine with me but jeez. Instead of putting it over a gentle contour, they made a very long hard backtracking hike up the side of the Laurel fork gorge. We don't even hit the summit, so why make it go so high? Everyone has agreed that it was the most pointless climb of the trail yet.At the bottom of pond flats I found a cooler, and said ""aww no way!"" It was full of root beer and Mountain Dew, and was left by a thru hiker from last year. I was only the second person to sign the register in the cooler, so it must've been put down right before me. I continued down to the edge of Watauga Lake, another lake, like Fontana, created by a dam, with very pretty blue green water. The whole time I was hiking over the mountains and around the lake, I had my phone in my hand; in about a week, im heading home. I've got a memorial service to go to on the 10th, so once I hit Atkins Virginia, I will be heading down to Tri cities airport and flying home. I had been texting my parents all morning to figure out my itinerary. My dad finally sent me a link to a final itinerary - that cost way less than I was expecting! - and I filled out my information, and now I am ticketed to go home and come back! Frankly, I thought this trip home was going to be an unwelcome interruption to my hike and just a struggle to find my way home. But instead, it's been keeping me going for the past weeks knowing that I'm going to see my friends, my family and Ali for a few days after putting in a month of solid solid hiking. I'm so excited to get that break, and especially to see Ali. When I come back, it may be a weird situation. I'll be seeing people I haven't seen for weeks, and I'm betting people will no longer be impressed when I tell them I started on the first of March (just about everyone who asks me when I started has the same reaction: ""wow! You're flyin!""). I've been leaving my phone number in the shelter registers so that people who know me can text me and I can try and meet up again with them. When I get back, I will have another about 6 week chunk of time before I am going home again, this time for commencement. I am hoping that I can up my miles through Virginia and Maryland and find myself in the middle of Pennsylvania or even further by that time. I passed over the Watauga dam, where a bunch of emergency vehicles were gathered for some reason. The trail from here starts up the side of Iron Mountain, a giant single ridge extending from here all the way to the Virginia border. The hiking started tough but became classic ridge walking, a lot of alternating ups and downs. I was shooting for Vandeventer shelter, about seven or eight miles up on to the ridge. The rain that had been predicted all day held off til this point, when it began to sprinkle on me. It wasn't unwelcome, though. It had been humid and stale all morning and the rain drops felt pretty good on my salty skin. It was supposed to downpour starting at around 3, moved back from 1. I passed zen master and pants, two hikers whose entries I've seen for quite a while. I also stopped at a small spring a mile and a half before the shelter. I had heard that the water st Vandeventer was down the mother of all terrible side trails, .3 straight down a hill. So I filled up my bottles at the small pools of water and cameled my way to the shelter. It's a pretty small shelter, for 6 people, made of cinder blocks like a few other have been in Tennessee. There was an older hiker here named Dream On, as well as Hootie, who's been hiking with the two hikers behind me for some time now. I was happy to be in the shelter and having a spot for the evening before the storm hit. The storm at this point had been postponed to 5 pm. Zenmaster and Pants showed up momentarily and though they were considering pushing on 7 more miles to the next shelter, decided not to risk it. So we hung out, made food, talked about a lot of things, and admired the spectacular view from right behind the shelter, which looks down onto Watauga lake and its marina, the surrounding town, and away to some gorgeous ridges in North Carolina. The ridge is very sharp on this southern side and the rock outcropping next to the shelter was a great place to sit. The shelter was now just about full, with just about one space left. The storm that was predicted never hit, and we cursed the weathermen and their lies. I dunno if I would've pushed on even if I'd known. Would've been a longer day, but would've left me with an awkward possible 25 mile day into Damascus tomorrow? Who knows. About 6, Golden Snitch and Seeker pulled up, looking only mildly moist from the sprinkling rain. I thought we were about to have to squeeze down in the shelter to accomodate, but they decided to set up their tents. I'm not complaining. 10:46 came up soon behind them and set up his own tent. Snitch made a fire and soon the place felt pretty homey. The reception here is pretty great and I was even able to FaceTime Ali as the sun went down. The Stars came out, I could see the twinkling lights of the town below, and a barred owl called for a few minutes nearby. It was a nice way to wrap up the day. Well, I hope I get at least some rain to justify all my worrying. It's supposed to storm now starting around 3am. Postponed 13 hours. Brilliant. The rain for the morning has been downgraded too, but there may be some sprinkles on me tomorrow early. Hey, I've been absolutely blessed with weather so far, and it looks like it'll be decent for the rest of my time until Atkins. Tomorrow I'll make a longer day, because the trail sticks up on this flat ridge. I'll probably go 22 miles. Some people are talking about making the 32 miles trek all the way to Damascus. It's an easy 10 miles, it looks like. I'll start with the 22 and then we'll see.","Black Bear Resort via Dennis Cove Road

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525967,"The rain did finally hit, and I was very glad to be indoors. The shelter is not the best constructed on the trail: I could feel the spray of rain from, well, somewhere, hitting me in the face as the drops came down. When we all woke, Golden Snitch and Seeker were hanging their wet things up to dry. Snitch bemusedly said that he thought his tent would be more waterproof. I also woke up to an extremely rude note in my guest book. Look. My journal is made up of my own opinions and perceptions of the trail and the people on it. While you may disagree with me, it is no more reasonable for you to tell me my opinions and perceptions are wrong than it is for me to say the same of yours. But don't just call me names because you disagree with me. At the end of the day, this is MY journal. This is MY forum to project what I think, and frankly, if you don't like it, there are literally hundreds of others to choose from. But I like it, and know many others do, too. As far as Kincora goes - and I know it means a lot more to other folks - it was nothing more than a business to me. My package arrived at 10:42, it sat on their porch for about four hours, I picked it up and happily tipped them the five dollars that they ask for holding packages, and left after no more than about twenty minutes. Seems to me like I was just as generous with the giving as those who stay there, get laundry done, take a shower and get a bunk for the night for the same price. Bob sounds like a wonderful and incredibly giving guy - he's a legend! - but he wasn't there when I was, and I decided that I would rather stay the night somewhere else. That's it. As far as my shoes go: I love these boots, I've never gotten a blister, and 800 miles in them is nothing to scoff at. The purchase of a Salomon boot doesn't just buy plastic and Gore-Tex, it buys the support and warranty of a reputable company that is apparently willing to replace even heavily worn and blown out boots. I don't think it's cheap of me to be asking for a replacement if they are willing to give it; I still don't know whether the outfitter WILL replace them, but if they do, it says great things about Salomon as a company, not bad things about me as a customer. And keep in mind, before you denigrate me and put Kincora on a pedestal, that it was literally an employee of Kincora who told me I should see if I could get the shoes replaced; I was ready to just toss them out. Consider my soapbox now gone from under me. Dream on headed out just earlier than me, but I passed him momentarily. The whole morning was spent along the Iron Mountain ridge with great views down into the valley below. The valley was filled with fog and green fields before the foothills of the mountains began again to the south and east. There was nothing particular about the hiking. It went up; it went down. The trail wove through narrow rhododendrons. Getting water is tougher than usual up here on the ridge. That challenge will only get more difficult in southern Virginia and Pennsylvania. The trail took a turn to the northeast and wound down off Iron Mountain to a neighboring ridge. Right before the road crossing was a giant orange cage attached to a tree with a big sign on it that said SNACKS! and explained that this was part of the ministry of a local church and a project organized by local 4th-6th grade girls. The magic is apparently restocked daily, which is abnormal for magic, most is one-time so it's strange to have a recurring place for magic. I ate lunch next to the box and helped myself to a Mountain Dew and a few mini cinnamon buns. The trail after the road crossing is apparently the only (or one of the only) handicap accessible mile of the trail, a wide flat gravel path that winds up through a set of pastures. It was very pretty hiking, and easy too, through the low grass of the fields. At the north end I saw a deer jump the barbed wire fence and sprint across the field before vaulting over the other side. The sun came out momentarily and the day became brutally hot and humid. It stayed overcast almost all day, which actually made for pleasant hiking, windy and a little wet but warm. I passed about the fifth Low Gap we've seen and began the last few climbs of the day. I had moved quickly all day, over three miles an hour pretty consistently. I had put in music after Double Springs Shelter and listened to a few Grizzly Bear albums. The trail passed a shelter that was clearly very very old and falling apart, but right on he trail. Soon enough I was at Abingdon Gap Shelter, ten miles short of Damascus. I did not expect to be the first one here, but was alone for quite a while. I changed, rolled out my bag and pad and went down to the water source (FAR) before Hootie showed up about 90 minutes after me. He says he's been feeling sick all day, but made a promise to himself and his father that he'd make it to Virginia by April Fools Day. He decided he wanted to push on at least 7 miles to the border even though he'd been feeling sick all day. Pants and Zenmaster were soon behind and were not so keen on moving on. We all said bye to Hootie and then cooked. Golden Snitch and Seeker arrived shortly after, and we're all together in the shelter tonight. Tomorrow I'll head the few miles down to Virginia and Damascus, and probably spend the day and night there, and get myself ready for 4 long days to Atkins.","Vandeventer Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526263,"Slept great last night, easily one of the best nights of sleep I've had on the trail. The sun was pouring in gorgeous and golden when I woke at about 7:30. I watched Seeker wake up Golden Snitch to look at the sun through the clouds. They talk to each other and make a fair bit of noise so pretty soon we were all up. I woulda been up anyways. I tend to laze around in my bag after waking up even though I know I won't be able to fall back asleep. It just feels nice to be warm. It sprinkled rain last night, but the day broke clear, a little cold, and gorgeous. We all packed up, but I was the first one out of camp. I don't know why I am usually. I spose I don't cook or anything, but I guess I just don't dillydally. I like to get out quick once I'm up. I put in music from the get go today and moved quickly over the trail; it was just about the easiest terrain I've had all trip. Nice and flat or downhill and wide. I listened to Arcade Fire's album Funeral and then a lot of Bon Iver. Then, a big signpost came in sight! VIRGINIA! I turned off my music and gave a big whoop of joy! The signpost (unlike the one at the NC/GA border) is tall and has lots of arrows and posts, sort of satisfyingly large for a landmark accomplishment along the trail. I sat and drank some water then pushed off, eager for town and lunch. The trail became even more nicely graded and wide. As if to signal my arrival somewhere new, I saw the first chickadee I've seen on the trail. 95% of the birds I've seen are Junkos, and it was nice to see a species that I recognized from home. From now on, I will be passing through states to which I've already been and even spent some significant time, that is, I am done with states I am visiting for the first time. It felt like a sort of homecoming, or at least a major milestone, and the happiness kept burning through me for the rest of the day. Soon enough, I saw the houses and buildings of Damascus down below, and the trail finally dropped down to street level and plopped me out right in a residential neighborhood. It always sort of takes me aback to watch woods give way to suburban streets. I began walking along pavement and soon found the large wooden sign that welcomed me to Damascus and Virginia. At the intersection of the AT and the Virginia Creeper trail (a rails-to-trails bike path) Damascus proudly bills itself as ""Trail Town, USA."" I got a great deal of friendly nods and waves as I passed along the gravel path that is the trail for the first part of town, past playgrounds and pavilions. I sat for a while near the first major intersection planning my entrance into the town, but unfortunately reception was bad and nothing much got done. I continued on to the center of town, where I found Hootie, who had camped right at the border last night after officially making it to Virginia on the first of April. He is feeling even sicker today. Poor guy. It was still about 11:30, so I decided lunch could wait a second, and I decided to see about my boots. I went into Mt. Rogers Outfitters, who quickly told me they don't stick Salomon. I went to another outfitter, Adventure Damascus, who said that they didn't have my shoes in stock, and so my only option was to call Salomon itself and see if they would send me shoes. Guess whose customer service lines are closed on the weekends. So after all that build-up, I am still going to be carrying my old boots. I will call Salomon when I get a chance on Monday and see what happens. The warranty information online seems like I may have another pair of boots in my future, but I may have unintentionally voided the warranty by replacing the laces. Which seems ridiculous. I asked the man working in Adventure Damascus where I could get a burger and beer. He pointed me right next door into Bobo McFarlands, where I sat down and soon had, well, a burger and beer. The burger was a reasonable size (aka not big enough) and soon I ordered a piece of chocolate cake at my waitress's recommendation. And then, something strange happened. The girl who had been sitting at the booth next to me came over and said she had half a beer left and asked if I wanted some company. I was getting bored with just staring at the AWOL guide, so I agreed. Her name is Martha, and it turns out she is an opera singer from Abingdon who has just returned from a long stint in Berlin. She is a graduate of UVA, and funnily enough was in the UVA Belles in 2011 when they held a joint workshop/concert with the Yale Whiffenpoofs to help a number of local high school groups in Charlottesville. The funny part is, 1) the Spizzwinks(?), my former a cappella group, did that same joint concert gig when I was a freshman, and 2) she is still Facebook friends with the Spizzwinks(?) who were Whiffenpoofs that year, whom I know decently well. I jokingly asked her whether she wanted to give me a ride to the airport in a few days, and to my astonishment, said yes! I was thinking I was about to spend my day running around comparing shuttle prices at all the different outfitters for getting to Tri-cities airport, but now, suddenly, I have the help of a local (who is connected to me in somewhat strange ways) who can bring me there, free of hassle and, apparently, free of charge! There is an expression - one that you hear less than ""hike your own hike"" - that just says ""the trail provides."" Through utter coincidence, and frankly some admirable gregariousness on Martha's part, I now have a ride to the airport in a few days. I couldn't believe it. Martha left to go bike back to Abingdon along the Creeper Trail, but we exchanged contact info so I could be in touch later in the week. Then I decided it was time to find lodging. I decided on the Woodchuck Hostel, which attracted me mostly because they had laundry on site (there is no laundromat in Damascus, so I would've had to go to a hostel to do laundry anyway). I showed up to a nice looking white house where roofers were hard at work replacing metal sheeting. I cautiously stepped in the front door but was greeted by Chuck, a former thru hiker (who went by Woodchuck) who quickly got me set up with a bed (with linens, which is surprisingly rare, actually). The ""hostel"" is just a house that has beds in strange places. It was nice to not have bunks. I took a very hot shower and got all my clothes together to do laundry. I came downstairs to find 10:46, who found his way here via hiking and car yesterday. I also found Dream On's brother, who is meeting him in town (but I believe he's been here for a day or two, and his brother is behind schedule). I also found a guitar!!! I quickly tuned it up and began running through my catalog of folk songs that I haven't been able to play in a month. Guitar is just what I do in my down time, and it was awesome to be able to pick one up again. I played quite a bit today. Chuck was offering a shuttle to the big grocery store nearby at 5, but I wanted to do a little shopping first, so I headed over to the Dollar General and got most of groceries for the next few days. I also ran into Frost and Rain Man, who are zeroing after what they called the ""Damascathon,"" a 30+ mile day that I believe they did with Doctor Trails, Seal Tree and Blaze. I hope I run into them tomorrow. I stopped by the outfitter and picked up some freeze dried dinners (and also got a free patch on a hole that has appeared in my down jacket) before heading to the hostel again. I went with Chuck and another hiker to the big grocery store and finished shopping, went back, played more guitar, and then went in search of dinner in town.I ended up - no surprises, frankly - at Bobo's, which was absolutely hopping by the standards of the little town of Damascus. I sat at the bar and had a beer before ordering Chicken Parm and discussing hockey with Jen, the bartender, who is an avid Redwings fan. I tried a stout from a small local brewery and was amazed. Seriously. StudioBrew Ferguson Stout. Get it if you see it. Delicious. I also met and talked with Richard about Trail Days, the huge AT festival that takes place here in mid-May. According to Richard, upwards of 150 thousand people pour through this town of 1200 residents in the span of a week. Jen backed him up and told me that the building Bobo's is in was built over the course of one Trail Days by a bunch of paid thru hikers. I was astounded. I don't know if I'll be here for trail days this year, but I feel like I should come at some point, because it seems pretty mind-blowing. After finishing my whole plate of spaghetti and chicken, I decided that one dinner wasn't going to cut it. I asked Jen for an order of chicken tenders and was surprised when she asked me what sides I wanted; it was going to be a full second dinner. I got Mac n cheese and cole slaw and another beer and sat at a side table and Facetimed Ali while I consumed more food than I thought I physically would have been able to. Feeling stuffed and satisfied I headed back to Woodchuck and got ready for bed. I haven't taken a zero in quite a while, but today was pretty close. With all this time off about to hit me in four days' time, I'm trying to push to the break. Tomorrow will take me up near the Grayson Highlands, Virginia's highest mountains. Don't know how far ill get at this point. But I'll be alright! It looks like four pretty simply days to Atkins.","Abingdon Gap Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526523,"Slept pretty well last night; I had a whole room with four beds in it to myself. Unfortunately a pair of hikers who rolled up late last night brought a dog with them who likes to bark at 6 in the morning. And as has been the case on the whole trail, once I'm up, I'm up. I tossed and turned trying to grab some more sleep, but to no avail. I headed downstairs at about 7, and was quickly handed a bowl of fried potatoes, orange juice and a waffle, which I proceeded to slather in margarine and syrup. Everybody else was up soon, too, but nobody seemed to be making moves to get going. Most people are staying in town for the day, or have been long-term work for stay employees at the hostel. I packed up my food bag, emptied my trash and packed my backpack. With the extra pair of boots and four days of food, the bag is the heaviest it's been in quite a while. I paid up with Chuck and headed out. The morning was colder than I thought it would be, chilly and breezy. I made my way through the quiet Sunday morning streets of Damascus. No one was really driving or walking around. I especially enjoyed passing by a gas station and listening to some blues song I couldn't place fade in and out of my hearing. Near the edge of town, I ran into a whole pack of hikers off to find breakfast, among them Zenmaster, Pants, Hootie, Wee Gillis and Wolf Peak (Wee Gillis' Dutch buddy). Pants stopped and chatted with me and wished me luck on the rest of my hike. I don't think they were zeroing, but I don't think they were planning on going anywhere until about noon. I like the three of them quite a bit; we make dumb jokes together and have fun. I hope I see them again. At numerous points in the day, the AT for a while hopped on to the Virginia Creeper trail, a wide, gravel rail-to-trail bike path. It followed the Creeper out of town before hopping back up on a side ridge. Right before a road crossing, signs told about a washed out bridge and a detour on the AT. The signs look so worn in, though, and the detour is so well marked that this must have been the current trail path for quite some time. The trail wound along a lovely River before switchbacking interminably up another mountain, ridge walking for a while, then returning to the path of the Creeper trail. As I dropped back down into the Creeper, I heard voices and was surprised to look behind me and find Doctor Trails, Blaze and Seal Tree! I thought they were way ahead of me, but they decided to zero twice in Damascus after walking 85 miles over the course of three days. In 35-10-40 chunks. They went from Watauga Lake shelter to Damascus in a single day. Yeesh. We chatted about the last couple of days as we walked two by two over the gravel path. I told them about the amazing coincidence that Martha is giving me a ride. Blaze joked that she came over and sat down because she liked my rugged looks. I responded that it was more likely because I smell great. We passed over a gorgeous trestle bridge above the river before dipping back into the woods again. I followed the threesome's slightly more relaxed pace in order to just be with some other folks. We stopped at Lost Mountain Shelter, which I thought would be my destination today, and is (probably) the destination of these three. We chatted with two section hikers, I used the privy (which has the entirety of Dr. Seuss's The Lorax written in Sharpie on the inside) and then made ready to head off again. It was only about 2, and pushing more miles today means less worrying about pushing miles later nearer to Atkins. The trail stayed flat for quite a while before skirting a gorgeous meadow and dropping me out below the 2.5 mile, 1600 foot climb up to Buzzard Rock. I stopped to filter a little water and met Babbit, another thru hiker, who is aiming for Thomas Knob Shelter, a large lean to right next to Mt. Rogers, the tallest point in Virginia. I passed in front of him and made the long hike up. It was very pretty, and I could see the vegetation slowly turning from old growth forest to birch trees and whatever those short trees covered in spines are that seem to be the only trees that grow near the top of balds. Soon I was out on the bald itself, clambering up to a ridge. Buzzard Rock is a subsidiary crest of Whitetop Mountain, but is completely bare, and had spectacular views. The day was perfect, not a single cloud in the sky. Away to the south and west I picked out the Roan Highlands, just a faint blue shadow now. To my right were more mountains of the blue ridge in North Carolina, sharp topped and spiny. But away to the north and west were mountains like I'd never seen: huge long ridges extending out of sight for probably 50 miles in either direction, gently rolling, almost always the same height, and between them, huge valleys filled with houses and fields and water. I knew I only had about 3 more miles of hiking, so I took quite a long break just drinking in the view. I spoke to three day hikers from North Carolina, probably just a few years older than me, who do a good deal of short backpacking trips. Yesterday they had just been on a mountain called three tops, which they pointed out to me on the horizon. I had seen the jagged summits before and wondered what they were, so I was glad to know. I pushed on over the bald and through scrub, getting treated to more gorgeous views. Mt. Rogers finally came into sight. It's not a very imposing summit, and apparently has no view, so I'll see how I feel about the half-mile side trip tomorrow. It is, however, the highest state high point east of the Mississippi without a road going to the top. Interesting how we just build roads to the tops of mountains. Most are just for tourism, it seems, and I guess were built a long time ago. I would bet that the roads would never get built like that if we had it all to do over again. Soon I was descending to the VA 600 crossing at Elk Garden, eight miles further than I anticipated I would be going today. I filled up from a stream and hit the road, making sure to go touch the first blaze on the other side, which is actually on a fence (probably to keep in the wild ponies!) The terrain opens up into a huge bald meadow area across the road, but I'm camped in the woods on the western side of the route. I set up my tent, cooked food and got bored enough to make a bear hang for my food for the night. Boredom literally made me more prudent. Babbit came along, and to my surprise still wanted to push on, despite its already being about 6:45. He ate dinner in the parking area (I think) and then pushed on. So it's just me tonight camped out at Elk Garden. It's already pretty darn chilly out, and it's going to be cold tonight. Tomorrow is even supposed to be colder! It's also gonna get downright freezing after I go back home in a couple days: snow is currently forecasted for Damascus for three days straight! I'll frankly be glad to miss that.","Woodchuck hostel, Damascus, VA

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526524,"The morning was clear and lovely after yet another pretty cold night. The view out from the road was very nice, and I woke up and broke camp a little earlier than usual. Having a tent up only adds about 10 minutes to my time breaking camp, which surprised me. The walk just past the gate at Elk Garden was among the most beautiful parts of the day. The trail passed over green grassy knolls, and, unlike over most balds, did not have a defined and rutted path. It was very freeing. The climb up to Thomas Knob was pretty uneventful. It became windier and windier near the top. I decided to pass up the side trail to Mount Rogers, because I've heard it's pretty steep and pointless. I was enjoying the views off of the bald too much to do extra hiking. I took a break at Thomas Knob where a section hiker told me I was going to get hypothermia if I stayed out in the wind. I think his intentions were good, it's just kind of rude. Polar Bear later confirmed that he is ""the most boring hiker"" he'd ever met. The water source for the shelter is enclosed in a fence, and I looked at my phone and saw that they did that so that the wild ponies won't contaminate the source. Then I remembered: PONIES! That's what the Grayson Highlands are famous for. And sure enough, only about a quarter mile past the shelter, there were two ponies, both with deep brownish ochre hair, grazing away at the fields. I took a few pictures and passed on. The trail passed along gorgeous rock outcroppings and huge areas of scrub with views in all direction. The wind was blowing pretty hard, and though the grades were easy, it was rock hopping most of the way, which was tough. I passed through a little cave shimmy called the Fatman Squeeze, where a few patches of ice are still hanging around, and saw another set of two ponies. The area here is not very well marked and is so open that following the trail is difficult, especially with so many tent sites around. I stopped at a particularly nice outcropping and spoke with two day hikers, who suggested that we fund research into turning the ponies into wifi hotspots (I had no reception all day long). As I was passing along a ridge, I noticed a large group of ponies down below me, as well as one shape that was definitely a thru hiker. I decided that now was the time for a side trip, so I made my way over to the ponies. There were about seven, all different colors, grazing away. Polar Bear was there, a hiker I've run into once before, taking pictures with his tripod. The ponies are very gentle, and we found that if we held our hand out in a fist, they would come up and nuzzle it, and, in the case of one very young-looking pony, even lick it! His tongue was green from all the grass he ate. I took a lot of pictures and then pushed on. The trail moved into Grayson Highlands State Park proper, and dipped back into the woods. I stopped briefly at Wise Shelter, and was about to move on when I noticed something shiny in the rafters. It was a Mylar space blanket, and with all the cold nights I've dealt with, I decided it was time I had one. I put it in my pack and moved on. I ate some lunch at a river crossing and just after I moved on again, I heard just about the loudest whooshing I've ever heard in my life. It started like wind, and then just got to be unbearably loud, like a jet engine. I looked for a plane, but I'm sure it would've been long gone. Just a bit along the trail I found Blaze fixing his socks! He left Lost Mountain Shelter at 5:00 this morning and caught up the eight miles to me. He left Dr. Trails and Seal Tree behind him, as he was hoping to do a bunch of 30 mile days in a row to get to Pearisburg by Friday, where a package is waiting for him. We paced each other for the next set of miles until Old Orchard Shelter. He said that he saw the plane go over, and it was an impressive new looking fighter jet, flying extremely close to the ground. We talked about different hiking agendas and our homes and the long trail. He's hoping to finish at Katahdin, hitch to the northern terminus of the long trail, and then begin hiking south, all the way back to Pennsylvania, in a modified version of what's called a Yo-yo hike. We stopped in at Old Orchard shelter and Blaze cooked up a meal for himself. He decided that trying to get to Pearisburg before the PO closes for the weekend was silly, and he'll just take his time and get there for Monday. I pushed on a little before him with music playing and made my way over the last (and only) real climb of the day up Iron Mountain (about the third iron mountain we've seen. We also passed the like eighth deep gap today) soon enough I was at the turnoff for Hurricane Mountain Shelter. It's new, and gorgeous, with lots of space. I also had reception for the first time all day. I checked the weather, and thunderstorms were suddenly called for in the next couple of hours, and I thanked the powers that be that I was at a shelter already. Blaze showed up soon after and we cooked and talked for a while, he made a call home to his nieces in Pennsylvania. It sprinkled a little rain, but nothing serious. Polar Bear and Babbit (who both stayed at Thomas Knob) rolled up, and we all laid out gear out in the shelter. Blaze was pretty excited because both Polar Bear and Babbit have his same pack, the Gossamer Gear Mariposa, which is not common at all on the trail. I facetimed Ali as the rain turned on, got heavy, turned off, and back and forth. I can't believe I'll get to see her, my parents and my friends in just a few days' time! Tomorrow I'll almost certainly head 19 miles to Partnership Shelter, which is extremely close to a road crossing and visitor center, and from which you can apparently order pizza. Babbit says he can't wait for the pizza and had half a mind to push on five miles just to get there a little sooner tomorrow. Today marked 500 miles, but also one month on the trail for me! Frankly, it's flown by. The days are so routined and full that I feel like it was just yesterday I was pulling into the NOC, or in Asheville, or really anywhere else. I'm having a great time so far. The scenery and hiking have been incredible, and I've met some wonderful people and had some great laughs. Frankly, I'm keeping the pace I was expecting to have, I mean when my parents asked where I thought I'd be by the time I had to go home, I said ""Damascus, even a little north of it, probably."" Which is exactly true. The days off from the trail are going to be a very welcome break, physically and mentally. It will be so good to see everyone. And when I come back, I'll have just about 6 more weeks of hiking before I have to be back again for Commencement! I'm guessing my pace will pick up through Virginia, that I'll consistently go above 20 miles a day, and that should put me somewhere in Pennsylvania for when I've got to go home again. We'll see. Gnight!","Elk Garden

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526657,"I woke up last night sweating, which was frankly a nice surprise given how cold I was expecting to be. I took off my raincoat to cool down, which turned out to be a bad decision. When the morning came, it was the coldest I've had yet on the trail, probably no more than about 20 degrees. I was still very cold in my bag. Blaze had apparently gotten up and left around 6:30, but Polar Bear, Babbit and I didn't start moving til about 8, when the light finally made us venture out into the frigid, windy morning. The trip to the privy was an adventure, and packing was slow as I kept taking off and putting on my gloves to accomplish tasks. For the first time this trip, I was the last one out of camp. I was wearing gloves, two hats, leggings, rain pants, two shirts and my coat as I headed out from camp. My boots felt like bricks on my feet. I got warmer as I started moving. The hiking was very easy all day, just a few gentle or short steep climbs and lots of extremely shallow rises and falls. I leapfrogged with the other two as we respectively took off and put on pieces of clothing as the day warmed, the wind picked up or the sun came out or went away. The trail passed by a lovely waterfall at Comers Creek. I stopped in at Trimpi Shelter for lunch at about noon. It's a big stone shelter with two shelves of beds for two people on each side and then an upper shelf for one on each side. It's strange looking but was nice to see. Polar Bear came by near the end of my lunch and made his. As I headed down to the next road, I passed Babbit, who was sure there would be trail magic at the road crossing. He was disappointed when there was none (and even more so when we heard trail magic arrived there just after we passed!). The trail started over a long set of ridges with views down into the sea of verdant green pastures to the southeast. I saw a number of deer over the course of the day, and yesterday, too. They must be much more common in VA. I passed a set of Sobo flip floppers who were slack packing the day, including a very excited girl named Greyhound, and (either her father or her uncle) whose name is Chopper. The last miles to tonight's destination were through a real green rhododendron tunnel. A very determined-looking man in sunglasses with a big beard passed by and said hello. Soon enough I was at Partnership Shelter! It's a huge structure, with space for about ten on the ground floor and a large loft with closable windows where I'm spending the night. Blaze left a note here that said he just stopped in for lunch. He was so excited about pizza yesterday, I'm not sure what happened. He changes his mind a lot, apparently. I sat for a little and then pushed on to the Visitor Center a few hundred yards away. I felt like a fish out of water stepping into the very clean atmosphere of the Mt. Rogers Visitors Center, but the lady working there ushered me in, and I bought a dr. Pepper and a kit kat, which I took outside to eat. It was already getting cold again, and I put on my second shirt and coat. Polar Bear showed up soon. He told me that the bearded man I just passed was the Real Hiking Viking, who began a his winter south bound thru hike at Karahdin on the first of January, and just passed the 3/4 mark today. It's apparently the first winter sobo thru hike ever, and it's only gonna take him 4 months! Polar Bear got a picture with him. We together perused the menu of Pizza Perfect, the restaurant in Marion that does a booming business delivering multiple hundreds of dollars worth of food a night to the visitor center. I had dinner enough for tonight, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get pizza delivered to my doorstep. We both settled on Barbecue Chicken Pizza and hot wings. Babbit showed up soon after and we all ordered together. The food was coming in 45 minutes, faster than I was expecting for a place ten miles away down from the mountains. We all went and set up our gear in the loft of the shelter before returning to the road to wait for the delivery man. Seal Tree arrived shortly after, as did Doctor Trails. They both spent last night at Old Orchard Shelter, four miles back from where I started. They expected Frost and Rain Man would be here soon, which they were! We picked up our food from the very friendly delivery man and headed back to the shelter and began to gorge ourselves. Babbit had bought a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi to share, and we all decided to share a fried dough sort of dessert called Zabola. Seal Tree looked on jealously as he waited for his food, as did Frost and Rain Man, who had just ordered. I finished six slices of my huge pizza and about 15 wings and hit a brick wall and had to stop. There was a lot of silence of waiting for food coma to pass. Babbit absolutely destroyed his food. Dr. Trails ordered way too much on purpose, and I believe he'll be carrying a lot of cheesy bread for the next couple of days. Rain Man started up a fire, which became the focus of the evening's activity. We all sat around the fire making jokes and telling stories about other hikers, which have become the topic of most of the conversations recently. Among the most talked about were Noodles, the brother of Dream On, who is hostel-hopping in Damascus while waiting for his brother and also hitching around the United States and Highland Dave, whom I met at Greasy Creek, who apparently walked from Atlanta to Springer as the start of his journey. I got ready for bed and turned in a little before most of the others to give myself time to journal. So tomorrow I'll make the 12 mile journey over a few hills to Atkins, where I hope I'll find Martha waiting to drive me to the airport! It's kinda crazy to suddenly be stepping away after a month of the hiking lifestyle, but I'm ready for a break, and incredibly excited to see Ali, my family and my friends. I hope I catch up to these folks again, though, especially Frost and Rain Man. They are my kind of people and seem to be pushing my kind of miles. Thru hikers will tell you that Virginia is flat, or that it's not flat and don't underestimate it. It was pretty flat today. When I come back, I'll be looking to push bigger miles, and having some company through those flattish weeks is going to be key to my morale and experience.","Hurricane Mountain Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526754,"I got just about the best night of sleep that I've had on the trail last night. Trying not to wake the other couple of hikers still sleeping in the loft, I descended the scary vertical ladder with my food bag and began snacking. Rain Man, Frost and Dr. Trails were already up. They decided (as I suggested last night) that the best way to resupply was actually to take Marion public transit right here from the Visitor Center and then head back out and do a half day. That seemed to be the plan for everyone, and they made ready for the 9 am shuttle. This southern part of Virginia is very simply split into three big chunks in terms of resupply: Damascus to Marion, Marion to Pearisburg, Pearisburg to Troutville, all between 75-90 miles. I think I was the only one actually heading out. Everyone seemed to be in a good mood this morning. The weather was pretty, the thought of town fresh on the mind, and at least Dr. Trails had leftover pizza. I headed out just before 9. I don't know whether I'll catch these folks again. I bet I'll catch Polar Bear and Babbit. But it's questionable for the others. I would like to run into Frost and Rain Man at least for a few days. The trail sort of gets confused here in southern Virginia. The geological Blue Ridge mountains fade into foothills to the southeast, and the AT starts hopping through the ridge-and-valley type formations that wind up on the VA/WV border and which will be all we'll hike along through PA. But today, the AT passed along some even smaller ridges that barely register on topo maps. The climbs ranged from very gentle to straight up the side of the ridge (in the case of Glade Mountain), but I only had 12 miles to do, and soon I found myself descending through the rhododendron forest and then the pastures surrounding Atkins, VA. At the last real road crossing before Atkins, I noticed in the guide that there was a museum about the early settlers of this area. But a little sign also said ""Trail Magic in School."" As I passed the road, I noticed a one-room schoolhouse building on my left, and decided to check it out. There was a sign on the door welcoming hikers, and I stepped inside the rectangular room filled with 19th century chair-desk hybrids, with a wood stove, and behind the door, more trail magic than I've seen the entire trip. There were coolers full of drinks and plastic tubs of snacks, as well as a giant bin filled with gear, first aid products, toilet paper, everything hikers need, really. I happily helped myself to a Mountain Dew and a honeybun and signed the register they had out on a desk. Then I headed back out through the pastures of southern Virginia, making the last few miles before my pickup. I watched a train pass far down below and descended to the tracks. The trail decided to switchback far more than was really necessary through these fields. I could've I moved back and forth more than parallel to the interstate than towards it. Looking at my map, it's pretty close. Finally, the meadow gave way to gravel and pavement, and in view of I-81 and some factories, I began a short road walk. I have a habit of touching the first blazes at side trails and road crossings so I don't ""miss"" any part of the trail, and I made sure to cover my tracks, finally touching a blazed stop sign just short of the interstate before turning around to go find some lunch. I was immediately met by two other thru hikers, Double Dip and Dirtface, whose entries I've seen for quite a while. From their names I wasn't expecting them to be girls (most girls on the trail end up picking nature-y or cute sounding names) but they are about my age or a little younger, and had just finished resupply and we're heading back off. I wished them luck. Maybe I'll see them again. For the moment I walked the hundred yards to The Barn, a restaurant right next to the AT crossing. The Barn was not what I was expecting. You know those linoleum-floored rooms in the backs of churches with just a few chairs and empty buffet tables where they occasionally hold spaghetti dinners for benefits? That's what the Barn looks like. But they made me a pretty darn good burger with bacon, onions, mushrooms, Swiss and bbq sauce. I had arrived just before 1 and Martha responded that she would be there around 2:30, so I took my time, charging my phone, uploading photos and telling my parents I was safe. Eventually I paid up and headed out to sit in the sun and wait for Martha. It wasn't more than about 10 minutes before a car pulled up and she hopped out, ready to drive me to the airport! I was still somewhat in disbelief that this was working, but loaded my pack into her car and headed off down the highway. The drive was very pleasant as we head through the valleys of Southern Virginia. Martha says she was grateful for the time out of the house. She's staying back with her parents for a few days before driving across the country for auditions and performances. We stumbled on even more coincidences as we chatted during the drive: she studied at the Jacob School of Music at Indiana, where my aunt Ellen studied, and they knew teachers in common (and had very similar opinions of them); she mentioned that she had just met up with her college friend on the trail, and I remembered Mantis' UVA hat. Turns out I've already met him, so we talked about him for a while. Mantis just got to Damascus, so he may be one of the first people I see when I come back. Cars are so much faster than people. In under an hour, we were pulling in to the parking lot of the La Quinta Inn where I'll be staying the night. I thanked Martha profusely and said goodbye, and headed inside. Apparently the ""Instant Hold"" reservation I made with just my phone number worked, and within seconds I was in my hotel room. I lazed around, texted Ali, showered and watched some episodes of China, IL (something of an off-day tradition for some reason) before heading across the street to Cracker Barrel for dinner. I had forgotten that chicken and dumplings are not the most flavorful combination, but the raspberry lemonade was exceptional, and I drank about six mugs and then took home a big to-go cup at my waitress's suggestion. Doing laundry at the hotel was an epic journey including many trips to the lobby for quarters and a lot of time spent face timing with Ali while I waited for someone else's loads to finish. But eventually I had clean clothes and said goodnight to Ali.It is strange to be getting off the trail for a while. I've become accustomed to a certain rhythm of life. Right now this still feels like a nearo day into town. I think that feeling will subside when I get on an airplane. But I'm incredibly excited to see everyone at home, and frankly, I'm very happy with how this leg of my journey has been. I'm just about four miles short of the one quarter mark of the entire trail (crazy) in just over a month, I've had astoundingly good weather, met some great people, and pushed myself in some wonderful ways. Not sure what my journal will look like for the next couple days. I'll probably check in once or twice, but expect me to be back fully by the 12th! Thanks for reading!","Partnership Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527510,"It's been a whirlwind of a few days. I flew home, spent a lot of quality time with Ali, got some real New Haven pizza, finally traded in my blown out boots for some new ones, watched the Spizzwinks(?) in their biggest concert of the year, went to a brunch with lots of friends, drove to New Jersey, saw my brother and my extended family, went to a beautiful and moving memorial service, ate, rested, and flew back. Now I'm back in Atkins ready to hit the trail tomorrow morning. I got a lot of questions about my hike from family and people at the service, and also a few people at the Charlotte airport recognized me as a thru hiker (including one former thru hiker himself!). Unfrotunately, Martha wasn't available to drive me back to the trail, but I organized a shuttle from Rambunny and Aqua, two former thru hikers and hostel owners who live just off the trail in Atkins. Rambunny picked me up from Tri Cities. She's hiked the trail three times and knows it inside and out, and it was great talking to her. She and Aqua seem to have fallen on some hard times physically - she's got some bad hip and leg issues and his kidneys are failing - and she says that helping hikers and hearing their stories keeps her going. She wants to wait a couple years and hike the trail again and become the oldest woman to thru hike the trail. We stopped in Marion so I could buy some groceries and I picked up a mail drop I sent myself at the Barn and then she dropped me off at the Relax Inn, just at the start of the road walk through Atkins, where I'm staying the night. Despite about three signs to the contrary, the Mexican restaurant next door was closed, so I somewhat reluctantly went to eat at the Barn again. It was tasty, even though the place truly feels like a middle school cafeteria. I looked through the hiker register they have, and saw that Doctor Trails and Seal Tree passed through a day after I left, Coco Ken, Santa and Wonder a day after, Magic two days ago and the Roman Noodles just earlier today! I think I'll be seeing some familiar faces for a while. I do hope I catch up with Frost and Rain Man though. Willard is just now getting to Damascus, where his family seems to be meeting him, so he'll stay about five days behind me. He's apparently finally picked up a trail name, Blue Ox, which I think fits him. He always said he wanted a unique name, and that's a great one. I'm looking to make it about 80 miles in four days to Woods Hole Hostel, where I'd love to stay the night. Then it's another 4.5/5 days of hiking to Troutville and the Roanoke area. These next weeks in Virginia look decently tough, actually, in terms of terrain. There's a lot of climbing up onto big ridges and then falling off them. We'll see. Shouldn't be any crazier than what I've already seen. My dad says that he is going to try to come down, pick up my brother and come visit me on the trail in about two weeks' time. That'll be lovely to look forward to. Back on the trail tomorrow!","The Barn Restaurant, VA 11

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527672,"It was nice to be in a bed. I savored the comfort and didnt get up til about 8. It's way easier to sleep in when the sunlight doesn't shine through the lack of a fourth wall in a shelter. I got all of my gear together. Offloading those boots was a big help; even with a bunch of food my pack still feels lighter than usual. I got everything together and was about to head out just before nine and very excitedly opened my door and found that it was pouring out. Back inside, to put on my raincoat and pack cover! Then I headed out. The rain let up pretty quickly, but it was a wet morning. I made my way under the interstate and began hiking through some lovely meadows. There were a few climbs involved, but nothing was crazy. Almost all the climbs are well-graded, and if they're not, they're short. Sometimes the trail follows a ridge and looks like it's about to climb up a steep pitch and veers away at the last moment and switchbacks up. These are all trail relocations. You can usually see where the AT used to go, straight up the ridges, and you can feel the change in terrain from rooty, rocky natural feeling trail to wide, well graded trail without a single obstacle. These reroutes have been very common in the last little bit. I was mostly alone all morning, but ran into a few hikers around noon, one of whom, Osgood, was mentioned in Northstar's journal from a few days ago. I was tailing a bunch of people I knew, and the thought of reaching them and saying hi egged me onwards today. The trail climbed down through some gorgeous pastures. I really like walking through these fields. It's freeing and gorgeous, and I like seeing all the little blaze-posts laid out in front of me. I climbed more stiles today than I have all trip, and they are of the ladder-on-both-sides variety, not easy to maneuver. There was a gorgeous bit when the trail made its way through two tiny lines of trees between two giant open fields. I made my way up and over a hill to Knot Maul Branch Shelter, where I knew I at least wanted to make it for the evening. Who should I find there but Chickenfoot! He keeps turning up places. He had laid out all - and I mean all - of his food on the picnic table and the shelter floor. Apparently he had packed too much and was trying to eat a bunch now so he didn't have to carry it. I wished him well and passed on. He's a bit crazy. I didn't want to stop at 14 miles, and the next shelter was nine and a half more. By it was only 2 and I felt pretty good so I moved on. I also am feeling more and more comfortable with late arrivals. There's no point just sitting around at a shelter starting at like 4:30 if I've still got gas in the tank. We'll see. I bet I can keep up 20 mile days through Virginia. A few bumps later, and I was beginning the ascent of Chestnut Knob, a ridge I had had in view all morning. It's the first really big ridge that the trail hops up on to and follows for a while, which will become a pattern soon and through southern Virginia. Chestnut Knob seems like one of the few climbs that they did not relocate. It was pretty darn steep in places. But nothing so far in VA has really compared to what I saw through the NC/TN border. Virginia isn't flat, so far, but it does have a larger percentage of flat miles between and during the climbs. About halfway up, who should I find sitting on a rock but Judge! He's been movin a little slower since Damascus but says he's ready to pick the pace back up. I wished him well and said I'll see him at the shelter. I topped out on the Chestnut Ridge, where the trail is a wide grassy path through the forest, and then gives way to real open meadow for a few miles. It was about 5:30 and the late afternoon sun made everything gold and gorgeous. The wind was low, and the hiking was spectacular. It was really quite a special moment for me, and one of the most gorgeous I've had on the trail. I felt more acutely than ever before the sheer expansiveness of America. Away to my south, the ridges I had just crossed in the morning extended for miles and miles in both directions, their folds and contours endlessly repeating away to infinity. And at their feet, the green pastures rolled away, the mountains like a brown snake laid on top of a green blanket. But I was ready to be done for the day. My legs were angry at me for pushing them so hard and I moved pretty slowly over the chill final miles to Chestnut Knob Shelter. I took quite a long break at a water source about two miles south of the shelter and are a candy bar to ease my fatigue, filled up from the slowest piped spring I've ever seen and saw Judge again. Soon enough i topped out along the ridge and found the shelter, a lovely stone cabin that used to be a fire warden's cabin but now has bunks and a picnic table in it. It was filled with familiar faces. First off were Crumbum and Doodle whom I left at Black Bear, Grandma and Bill Nye whom I met at Standing Bear, Lightning, whom I met on day 2 and never got his trail name, and then the couple with whom I talked at Springer mountain, who did the BMT instead of the AT until past the smokies. They picked up the names Audubon and Quixote. I've seen today four different people who all started the same day as I did! It's crazy! Quixote told me that she actually asked this morning ""I wonder what happened to Ben from New Haven."" Crazy coincidences! A peek in the log showed that Blaze was here on the 7th, DT, frost, rain man, polar bear and seal tree were all here on the 8th, magic, white rabbit and large here two nights ago and Mantis and Northstar here last night. Slug was here this afternoon! It promises to be a long time before this reunion with familiar faces is over. Slug texted me and says he's camping just a few miles down from the shelter on the ridge. Can't wait to see him again. We all cooked dinner and it was a party in the lovely cabin (where it became much warmer than outside as the temp dropped). The conversation, as usual, revolved around other hikers and prop on the trail whom we've met. We all went outside to watch the sunset. There's a great view on both sides of the shelter, down into the valley to the south and down into a giant bowl-shaped rock formation with farms in it called Burkes Garden to the Northeast. I'm sheltering for the night, and not sure what tomorrow will bring. More hiking I spose! It's been a pretty perfect first day back on the trail.","The Barn Restaurant, VA 11

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527808,"The gang was up earlier than I usually see, moving around starting at 7. I hung around in my sleeping bag for a while, as did Crumbum and Doodle next to me. It was still pretty chilly last night even in the big cabin. Today was sort of a strange one to plan. There was very little water anywhere, which means there were very few options for camping. It was either 10, 15 or 24 miles. Most people thought they could do the 24 but were hedging their bets with 15. Everybody but Lightning was out before me, but I followed closely behind Crumbum and Doodle down the first pitch of hiking. The trail this morning brought us along the south rim of Burke's Garden, a giant geological bowl where - apparently - underground caverns collapsed. The south side of the ridge sloped away gently and the north side fell in granite cliffs down to the farms below. It was neat. The 9.7 miles to Jenkins Shelter (essentially the first landmark on this empty day) were not particularly easy, a lot of up and down along the ridge line, and often quite steep in short pitches. My feet were also still sore from yesterday and the sharp rocks underfoot weren't making me too happy. I passed Slowhand, whom I'd seen in a picture slug sent me last night. I stopped in for lunch at Jenkins Shelter, joining Bill Nye, Grandma and Judge. They're my kind of people. Grandma is a recent Dartmouth grad and Bill Nye is a big nerd with a ton of information from Georgia State. They're witty and fun to hang around with and laugh at my puns. Nice. I leapfrogged a couple times with Quixote and Audubon for the next little while. The ridge after Jenkins was all along an old, flat woods road and was lovely compared with the morning. I rolled down to Laurel Creek, the 15 mile option (and home of a gorgeous footbridge. Seriously. Some of these VA footbridges are feats of architecture and beauty) passed the couple for the last time and decided to push on the 9 and a bit miles to Helvey's Mill Shelter. There was no water to be had between here and there (as there wasn't between Chestnut and Jenkins, essentially) so I tanked up for the second time of the day. The hiking was very nice and easy grades along a ridge with views down into a Valley where I could see the town of Bastian in the distance. I moved pretty quickly but popped in some music with about 4.5 miles left just to get my mind off my feet. Eventually I came to a dirt road, the start of the longest road walk the trail has gone over yet. The gravel was tough on my sore feet, but I moved decently quick down to the state route where the pavement began. I pushed on down the hill to the overpass above I-77, jamming to Arcade Fire's song Deep Blue. I hope some driver saw me. The trail moved down to a trailhead and jumped back into the woods. I saw an owl fly up into the trees and he watched me as I passed, his head turning 180 degrees to follow me. The trail climbed more steeply than it had all day up to the final ridge. I was ready to be done for the day. Just as a final challenge, something overstrained in my hip about a half mile short of the shelter which made me stop taking long strides. Should be better by morning. I finally made it to the shelter turnoff, and shuffled down to where I found there was still space in the shelter, which currently just had two occupants, Homemade and Short Leash from Manhattan who are sectioning to Damascus from Pearisburg. Aaaaaand Slug! It's good to see the man. He seems happy and healthy, and having a good time. We caught up as we made dinner. It was news to him - as it was to me last night - that Brit got driven to DC and is staying there for a few weeks before getting back on the trail at Harper's Ferry. Audubon and Quixote showed up soon and began to cook. Grandma was next, followed by Bill Nye and Judge sometime later. Lightning didn't make it here, and I wasn't expecting Crumbum and Doodle to. I'm in the shelter tonight with the two New Yorkers, Bill Nye and Judge. Tomorrow everyone's plan is to walk at least 16 to Trent's Grocery, a deli/market that's a half mile off the trail, then probably camp or a few miles onward. I think this is definitely the longest I've gone in a series of two days, so I'm ready for a shorter day tomorrow.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528061,"The sunlight was streaming in this morning. This shelter faces east. I was somewhat amazed at how bright it was getting up. Better get used to it as the days grow longer. Everybody was packing up around me and I, as usual, was slower than everyone else in that regard. I packed up my bag and pad before heading the long trek down to the water source, a task I had left for morning when I assumed my feet would be less sore. They were, but it was still a ways. The two Manhattanites were out quickly. Her name is Homemade because she sewed and made ultralight gear for personal use before ultralight gear was really sold by anyone. Quixote and Audubon were long gone, and soon the trio headed out a few minutes before I was finished packing. Slug was a bit behind me. The morning was nice and easy, but long, along an up and down ridge to the next shelter, similar to yesterday morning but with much better footing. I leapfrogged a bit with the trio and ended up being right in front of them, feeling like a Tour de France rider getting pulled back into the peloton. We all stopped for a break at a road crossing and were disappointed when the man parked there with the truck did not have trail magic for us. It was turning into a gorgeous day. Bill Nye found a skeleton (probably a deer) and Judge - now going by Uncle Frito - affixed a small bone to his pack menacingly. We all paced each other up the next mountain until I stopped to make a sign on the ground at the spot where the trail hit 600 miles! The other three moved on. At the crest of the mountain just .1 onwards, I found another 600 mile sign! But my sign is bigger. And actually at 600. Hurmph. I am curmudgeonly about this sign making thing. We all stopped in for lunch at Jenny Knob Shelter and talked a lot about Scooby Doo. I impressed on Grandma the importance that he see ""Scooby Doo and the Gang meet Mama Cass,"" just an absolute triumph of a made-for-TV movie from the 70s. As we packed up, two hikers I haven't met came up, Rabbit from Germany and Palindrome from New York. They began March 9th, and are moving very quickly!! I like to think that without my five days off, I'd be right where they are, but I may be kidding myself. The four of us set out together from the shelter with me in the lead and paced each other up the next climb. Soon we all separated, and then I took a break and was passed by Bill Nye. My feet were getting very sore by this point, and the terrain at the top of the ridge was Sharp rocks and narrow tread. My feet's endurance to soreness seems to have been very diminished by my time off. Fortunately most of the rest of the hike was along woods roads and flat even ground. I scared the crap out of Bill Nye when I passed him, and after a lovely bucolic meadow - Slug's favorite - and the first big suspension bridge we've crossed, we found ourselves at the road crossing for Trent's Grocery, where we knew we could get sandwiches and other snacks! Audubon and Quixote were there and headed out towards the restaurant just before me. I stashed my pack up the hill and just brought my phone and wallet and some other things and began the half mile road walk. Hitching did not work. I finally pulled up to what looked like a gas station. It was essentially a gas station that also sold burgers. I ordered at the register. The service was extremely slow, but the double bacon cheeseburger was pretty damn good. The other three showed up soon after. Uncle Frito got the last burger patties, leaving the other two to pizza and corndogs and chicken sandwiches. Slug showed up soon, as did Unicorn, a hiker I haven't seen since Mount Collins Shelter, who is covered in Marine Corps tattoos. I bought some honey buns to finish off my meal and after a very casual early dinner packed up to go. I had not really been sure what my plan would be throughout the day. I kinda wanted to make it into Pearisburg tomorrow, but that meant missing out on Woods Hole Hostel, one of the most well-like hostels on the trail. It also meant a 24+ mile day tomorrow, which I knew was not going to make my feet happy. But what sealed it for me was when I told Frito where I planned to stay, he informed me that they don't open until May. The hostel where I wanted to stay in Pearisburg was going to be closed and the other option was way across town and apparently not nice. Sooo I decided for the sake of my feet and that I really like the group of hikers I've fallen in with, I would stay at Woods Hole tomorrow. So that meant that tonight I didn't have to push to a further campsite of Wapiti Shelter but instead could stay right near Dismal Falls, one of the best swimming holes on the trail, with apparently some great camping spots. And with only 1.8 miles left to go (and a shorter day planned tomorrow) we thought it would be fun to pack out some beers for tonight. I grabbed two tall boys and waited while the other guys packed up (they did some actual resupplying, which is pretty doable, despite its only being s gas station) and then walked back to the trailhead with them. They kindly waited for me as I refound my stashed pack and got reddy to go. Bill Nye and I pulled ahead of he other two and spent the next forty minutes talking about megaviruses, retroviruses, neurovirology, the nucleus accumbens, gravitational waves, James Joyce, Jose Saramago, and Toni Morrison. Bill Nye is quick as a whip and smart as hell. It just seems like he knows and can talk confidently about everything under the sun. Soon enough we hit the side trail to the falls and without hesitation turned down. Multiple people had scrawled notes on the sign to the effects of ""great watefall, great camping."" We were quickly met by a sprinting Audubon and a bemused Quixote. Apparently they made their way to the next campsite, set up, then headed down to see the falls, and realized that this campsite was way better. No idea why Audubon was sprinting. At the water, Palindrome and Rabbit were already bathing and welcomed us down. The sun was about to hide behind the mountains, so I decided against jumping in. But after setting up my tent next to Palindrome I went and soaked my feet (and put my beers in a wading pool to cool off). Frito showed up soon enough already halfway through a Budweiser he cracked a mile back while waiting up for Grandma. Audubon and Quixote shared some chips and salsa with us while we soaked our feet and talked. Grandma came over soon. Apparently he had been hanging out at a tent site. I get along very well with this little crew. Slug showed up soon enough and was his usual incredibly enthusiastic self. If Slug likes something, he goes on about it. Slug likes this campsite. I wasn't all that hungry, so I just snacked instead of making dinner. I figure if I can save a few of my Mountain House meals (which I don't expect to find in Pearisburg) I'll have a better time on my way to Daleville. I also drank the beers. Duh. Unicorn and his buddy showed up and he took a GoPro video of himself jumping off the rocks into a pool of water (and pissed off a few locals who were fishing). The other three guys decided to camp out across the river (accessible via a large log, which Bill Nye basically runs across, or by fording, which Frito and Grandma did. Bill Nye carried grandmas stuff.) Lightning showed up later in the evening, after what I supposed was a 27 mile day! He camped at the first possible campsite at 15 miles yesterday. I hung a bear bag and retired to my tent for the evening. Tomorrow looks like a pretty simple 13 mile day up to Woods Hole. I hope they've got enough space: a lot of folks are hoping to roll in there tomorrow night. Then I think the plan is to do 10 miles to Pearisburg, eat lunch and resupply and then head out. It's another 90 miles to Daleville past that, so another heavy pack is in my future.","Helvey's Mill Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528189,"Palindrome was up, as he promised, at 5:30. Apparently he and Rabbit have a tradition of going over to King's tent and waking him up and yelling that the kingdom is under attack or the family jewels have been stolen. Anyways. I was up earlier than normal around 7:15, but I broke camp pretty slowly. Lightning was out early. I wandered down to the water to have breakfast. Bill Nye came over and said that he and Grandma have both been having some pretty bad nausea. They thought the culprit may have been the pizza at Trent's, the only food they had in common. Bill Nye pushed on ahead of me, I followed a few minutes behind. The miles to Wapiti Shelter moved faster than any others I've encountered, almost entirely flat and on good tread, through rhododendrons and meadows around a pond. Took me about an hour and 45 to do over 6 miles. Good pace. I pulled into the shelter where Quixote, Audubon and Lightning were having what they called brunch. The couple pulled away soon but I hung out and made plans to pace with Lightning. We stopped at the next water source before crushing it up the only real climb all day. We move pretty compatibly together. It's amazing what I can do now my legs are working and I've lost almost as much weight as I was originally carrying in my pack. We topped out along the ridge and stopped at a lovely view of the huge Pearisburg valley and the surrounding ridges. It's amazing how big some of these views feel. What a huge country. We leapfrogged with the couple as we made our rocky and roller coaster way down to Sugar Run Road, where the Wood's Hole Hostel side trail is. The side trail is dirt, and a number of big vehicles were regrading it as we went down. Soon enough, a complex of buildings came into sight: Wood's Hole! We were immediately greeted by Smokey Bear and Jess, two Work-for-stay employees. Jess is a local working on and off here for a few months, Smokey Bear a hiker waiting on a replacement pack to get shipped. Unfortunately the owners were out; apparently their cooking and company add another great facet to the hostel. But man it's the sweet life here at Wood's Hole. The bunkhouse is gorgeous with real mattresses upstairs, and a mini fridge filled with drinks and snacks hit the spot immediately even without having any real lunch. The other folks had packages arriving here so I watched as they enjoyed all their new snacks. Lightning's mother also sneakily paid for a private room for him in the main house. There were ducklings and chicks in a bathtub, which they are apparently trying to ""socialize"" to humans. Grandma showed up, having hitched a ride from Dismal Falls back to Trent's Grocery and then to here with the very outspoken local whose catchphrase is ""Tell the Truth!"" He said he was still feeling quite ill and took the other indoor room and was promptly asleep. Slug and Frito came in, as did Alpha and Unicorn. I hung out, had snacks and put in some laundry before catching a ride into town from a shuttle driver named Don. We decided that with no dinner here, we'd rather just go into town and resupply now and eat at the All you can eat Chinese buffet tonight rather than tomorrow at lunch (though lunch is still an option). We stopped at the post office, where I sent a couple postcards and was delighted to find Ghost shipping his winter gear north! We chatted and said we'd see each other up the trail. We went on to Food Lion and did a little resupply. I had quite a bit of food leftover from Atkins, but still ended up doing a full round of grocery shopping because the next chunk of trail is one of the longest we've had without good resupply, probably five days of hiking before Daleville. Lightning, the couple and I headed over to the Lucky Star buffet and promptly gorged ourselves. Slug rolled in with Frito and Alpha and Unicorn soon after. I ate a bunch of those fried dough rolls covered in sugar. Everybody else wanted to go to Dairy Queen across the street, and I hung out a little longer, not needing ice cream with my extremely full stomach. As I crossed the parking lot I thought I recognized the two men heading to the buffet. Northstar and Large! I thought they were significantly ahead of me, so it was great to see them! Northstar is meeting up with his wife in a few days and Large and White Rabbit had to take a day off here yesterday because she was feeling ill. Large told me that another group of hikers were up at the motel next to the DQ hanging out, so I stopped by and said hello to Thor, White Rabbit, Ash, and the hikers I knew as Statler and Waldorf who I think now go by different names. I then headed to DQ where we were promptly picked up and brought back to the hostel. I folded laundry and organized food before sitting around a fire Smokey Bear had built and talking with the folks around. Lightning came down from the Big house and after we called him king of the castle he greeted us with ""What's up, peasants?"" Slug and Frito pulled back up soon; unicorn and alpha stayed in town. I think they've already blue blazed/yellow blazed a lot, they're just looking for a fun time. We sat around the fire and talked a lot about people who've gotten off the trail. It's so easy to just kind of fall off and out of the world of hiking. It would've been super easy for me to fall off just a few days ago. There were a few hours there with ali when I seriously was considering just not coming back. God bless her, she just said that I have to finish the trail for me and for us. That thought has been on my mind a lot and it's keeping me going. But I'm having fun out here now. Tomorrow will be tough with my pack really heavy, but we've got an 18 mile day planned. Should be alright.","Dismal Falls

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528265,"I had trouble sleeping last night and then I realized that it was because I was too warm. I threw off the blanket I had on my bag, and took off my down jacket and my rain pants and found myself much more comfortable. I was up at about 7:30 getting my things together, but as always, it's impossible to leave a hostel quickly. There was fresh-baked bread and homemade apple butter and earl grey tea (which I've decided I do miss quite a lot) to be had. I sat at the breakfast table with Quixote and Audubon and Slug. Frito was up soon, too. I packed up all my food bag and got my pack mostly ready. Grandma came down for a little bit. He's feeling much better but is waiting for Bill Nye to come along, which he hopefully will later today. He's not sure what he's going to do about the 13 miles of trail he missed. We encouraged him to do what made him happiest. I settled up with Jess and was finally out by 9:30, just after the couple. Everyone was joking that we needed to find excuses to stay extra days here. It's a truly amazing place. Probably my favorite hostel so far. I hiked with Audubon and Quixote for the whole morning. They're both Bowdoin grads and are moving to Palo Alto because Quixote is going to grad school in a few months. Audubon is from New Rochelle and Quixote from Brooklyn and then Weston, CT! We talked about liberal arts and fantasy books and hiking, and eight miles passed very quickly to a lovely set of ledges where we ate an early lunch. I pushed on to fill up some water and we leapfrogged down the steep descent into Pearisburg. I noticed that in some of the ravines, the leaves on the trees are starting to pop out! It's turning into summer here. The final stretch before the road was covered in purplish white wildflowers and was a gorgeous carpet of natural color. The day was perfectly clear again, and the sun was hot. I was very happy not to have to go into Pearisburg this morning. It didn't seem like an easy hitch and the trail has recently been rerouted farther away from town. After a little jump over a hill, I crossed a river on an interstate bridge and began ascending the last 6 miles of the day. The sun was beating down on the trail and I had made good time in the morning, so I took a couple of pretty long breaks. I talked to Ali and also sorted through some housing things for next fall with the help of the parental units. I ran into Northstar, who Sobo'd a 20 mile section from the Captain's, and is taking a few days off to meet up with his wife and have a little vacation. The final miles were pretty consistent climbing up gravel. It's going to be very hot the next few days and I need to figure out some way to stay cool down here. I ran into Phat Sister and Beans, renamed from Statler and Waldorf, whom I hitched with into Franklin more than a month ago. We leapfrogged a bit. I filled up water a couple times before finally hitting the shelter. It's a nice log cabin lean-to, but the real highlight is that just over a stile is a huge field with an incredible view down into the valleys of West Virginia, a state I have never laid eyes on before. A sign nearby proclaims, ""West Virginia, By God!"" The trail follows the border for the next couple of miles. I sat out in the late afternoon sun and sang me some Country Roads before heading back to the shelter. The Hecklers (as Magic and I used to call them) moved on a few miles, as they only started in Pearisburg. Audubon and Quixote rolled up a few minutes later, as did a number of southbound hikers out for a weekend. They're tented nearby, but the couple decided that they would stay in a shelter for only the third time their trip. We all cooked dinner. Lightning rolled up soon and I went down to face time with Ali in the lovely field. We all came out and watched the bright orange sunset over the ridges to the west. Tomorrow will probably be a longer day, but a similar style of ridge walking with just one big drop and climb in the middle. Looking to do about 20 miles, to make it to Four Pines Hostel in three more days. Maybe. All subject to change.","Wood's Hole Hostel

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528514,"I woke up earlier than usual this morning after a pretty bad night's sleep. Don't know why I didn't sleep well. The section hikers were lovely and inquisitive and offered me all sorts of food. They all run marathons and have sectioned most of Virginia. Quixote and Audubon were off earlier than I was, and Lightning waited around so we could head off together which was cool of him! We paced over the first part of a pretty ridge before we split up when I went to get water and he went to ""see a man about a horse."" The ridge was pretty lovely hiking. I saw where Bean and Phat Sister must've camped at a smoking fire pit. I found the couple sitting at Dickinson Gap eating ""first lunch"" and passed them and went up the first real climb of the day. I really do like having some challenging climbs in the day. I feel a kind of runners high at the end of them. I made my way down to Pine Swamp Branch shelter for lunch where Bean and Phat sister were hanging out. We joked about bears and bear suits and bears in bear suits. They're great in small doses. The next section kinda pissed me off. The trail almost hit a river and road crossing but then did a 180 up a giant hill. Then back down to the water. There were a bunch of blowdowns, one of which required crawling under. I didn't stop at The Captain's which was apparently a mistake because there was free soda to be had. I then started up the second big climb of the day feelin pretty good. I had Graceland stuck in my head as I pulled into Bailey Gap shelter, 16.5 miles into my day. Though the plan had been to get to Wind Rock and camp, I felt good enough to want to go just under 9 miles to War Spur Shelter. I skipped the first spring after the shelter and was going to use the second. It was a mistake. The spring was dry and my bush whacking search for an alternative was fruitless. So I scratched even the possibility of camping at Wind Rock for the evening and decided to go the 4 more miles to the next water. The trail over this part of the ridge was ROUGH. Tons and tons of rocks and an infuriating grade that constantly jumped up and around trees then back down. There were a number of section hikers at the road crossing just before Wind Rock and I passed an older woman thru hiker named Goal Digger. I stopped at Wind Rock. The ledges are lovely but the view is of a very nearby parallel ridge, not very interesting or expansive. The trail improved drastically after that but my left shin was hurting a little. I popped in music about 3.5 miles before the shelter and soon enough found myself down there. There was still room in the shelter next to a mother father and daughter from Lee, Mass. The father, jigsaw, has sectioned all but about 200 miles of the trail over 20 years. Also here is Spirit of 76, a German thru hiker living in New Orleans. We talked as I made dinner and set up. The hecklers rolled up soon enough and cooked dinner themselves, but made ready to go another 6 miles to the next shelter for some reason unbeknownst to me. Just as they left around 8:15, the couple came in, looking just as frustrated as I expected they'd be after not having water where they wanted it. All was well, now, though, as dinner was made. They informed me that Lightning apparently had a mouse chew through about 90% of the shoulder strap on his backpack and weren't sure where he was at. He rolled in just before 9, and we were all very excited to see him. He stopped off at the captain's and apparently used Ghost's sewing kit to Jerry rig his strap together. I apparently made it in front of Ghost and couldn't offload his sock (given to me by Slug). So everyone made it despite hardships! We have set ourselves up for an 18 and then a 15 into four pines hostel in two days, where I'll pick up a little more food before Daleville. This has been my longest day ever! Still feelin good and goin strong.","Rice Field Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528684,"Jigsaw snored like, well, a jigsaw, and I had some trouble getting to sleep. I woke up feeling pretty rested though, and after a dream where I'm pretty sure Quentin Tarantino and I were trying to stop Jim Carrey from achieving some diabolical plan. The sectioned were out pretty soon, as were the couple. I was out right before Lightning. At Wood's Hole, Slug entrusted me with Ghost's sock that he lost, thinking that I would pass him faster. Apparently I passed him without running into him, as Lightning said he was camped at the Captain's for the night. I left a note and hung the sock from a signpost impossible to miss next to the shelter. Here's hoping the sock found its owner. The trail headed down before beginning a long and pretty tough ascent of Kelly Knob. I got flashbacks to the previous Kelly Knob in Georgia, but this one was less ""emotionally crushing,"" as Willard had put it. I passed the sectioners and met Cabot and Hobbes, a couple from Maine thru hiking. At the top a side trail led to an awesome series of ledges looking south into a long valley. The trail dropped down from there past a shelter and into a long long set of pastures. Out from under the tree cover, it was blisteringly hot and I tried to move quick through the open terrain. It was the warmest day I've had yet and even supposed to be the warmest we have for a while. I half expected some modern day Tom Sawyer to be lounging in the shade of a lone pine tree up in the pastures and amused myself with the idea as I headed towards the second big climb of the day. I stopped for lunch at a lovely footbridge (and the last on-trail water for 9 miles) and sat in the shade enjoying the day. Cabot and Hobbes rolled up, as did Quixote and Audubon. I ended up staying there probably about an hour, because there was just no need to push myself today with only 9 miles left. We chatted and enjoyed the animals we found in the creek - a crayfish, two snakes and a big frog - before finally deciding it was time to go. The trail started going up and up and up. I passed the Keffer Oak, the biggest tree on the AT in the south, and had a number of cows give me skeptical looks as I walked past them. The mile and a bit up Sinking Creek Mountain was very steep and draining on my legs. I took a few breaks and soon had Lightning and the couple come by, so I fell in with them. We passed over a ridge that went from very flat and nice to very up and down rocky and finally a long series of slanted ledges with spectacular views, but very difficult footing. The sun was still beating down on us. Lightning and I paced each other throughout the afternoon. He's just a few months older than I am, also taking off senior year to hike, and is very joyful. At the end of the ridge, we came to a sign marking the Eastern Continental Divide, splitting where the watersheds flow south and west to the Gulf of Mexico or east to the Atlantic. I came up with a visualization that I really like: all the big rivers we've crossed have so far flowed from our right to our left, and in fact, all water from this part of the trip must either flow from right to left or flow into a larger river that we then pass, flowing from right to left. The French broad, the Nolichucky, the New River, all have gone from our right side to our left. From now on, the reverse is true, and the big rivers, the James, the Susquehana, the Delaware, the Potomac, the Hudson, all will flow from left to right. I enjoy this fact. More importantly, Lightning and I decided to make our contribution and each relieved ourselves on both sides of the divide. The trail made a few more miles of rocky descent to Niday shelter. We were the first ones there and we hung out on the stoop of the shelter for a while. Audubon decided to hide our packs far away when we went to get water so we put his even farther. Cabot and Hobbes came by and passed on, looking for a longer day after their short day yesterday. Spirit of 76 came up soon enough and we cooked dinner. Then palindrome and Rabbit arrived after their very long day. They're alright, but need to respect Hike your own Hike more. Palindrome especially is a bit judgmental of other people's miles, and when I told him I was off trail for five days, accused me of having Noro and hiding it. Rabbit is quieter, but told me I needed to wash my legs because he thinks the dirt is disgusting. He was right, though, and I did wash them off a little later.I'm the only one in the shelter tonight with everybody else camped out. Tomorrow will be another pretty full day into Four Pines Hostel, where I will take a shower and do laundry and pick up some things at a grocery store for the day and a half to Daleville. My father told me that he's finalizing plans to pick up my brother in DC and come down and visit me this weekend! Which is so exciting!! It means being clean and good food and easy resupply and cars! I'm looking forward to it. Night!","War Spur Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528869,"Despite being the only one in the shelter, I had a lot of trouble sleeping last night. It was very warm out and I had trouble keeping both my upper and lower body the correct temperature. Plus Palindrome and Rabbit continued their tradition of getting up at 5. I put my earplugs in at that point. The morning broke on another gorgeous day. Lightning and I headed out together at about 8:15. The first climb up was pretty nicely graded and we went very fast. The trail up at the top was a lovely and wide path. We paved with 76 over the ridge and up to a monument to Audie Murphy, the most decorated soldier of WWII. The ridge down was nice as well, but a little more exposed and it became warm. Unlike the past few days, there was a haze in the sky and a breeze that kept us cool on the climb up. At the base of the descent we filled up water in a creek where Audubon and Quixote were, and were ecstatic to see that someone had left a pile of cans of Coca Cola in the river! I considered eating lunch but decided that I would rather push on the 5 miles to Dragon's Tooth for that. The hike moved through planted spruce forest and then up along a curving ridge before becoming essentially the most difficult terrain we've encountered yet on the trail. The path pushed up through spines of rock and steep leaf covered trail and was extremely tiring. The climb went on forever, but damn the views started to be fantastic. We could see away to the valleys on either side of us for miles and miles because the ridge fell away so steeply. Finally the four of us made it to the side trail for Dragon's Tooth, where the trail widened due to its use by day hikers. The tooth itself is pretty amazing, a giant upturned shelf of rock jutting out into the air probably 50 or 60 feet in the air. We took turns clambering our way up to the top (very sketchy climbing, but totally awesome). Lightning entrusted me with his GoPro and I took some selfies. It's an absolutely amazing place. The view is probably the best we've had of the whole trip, 360 degrees through valleys and ridges of Virginia. It's astounding. I ended up going back up a second time because I didn't have the right pose the first time. But I was happy to. We spent probably about an hour. The trail descends along cliffs, staircases and slabs of rock with iron staples for about a mile after Dragon's Tooth, and it kicked everybody's ass. Finally after a few miles we made it down to Newport Road, where i thirstily drank some water from a stream before meeting with Lightning who had fallen a little behind and walking towards the hostel. About .2 down the road, we were picked up by the Dragon Wagon, a large van driven by Eddie who works at the Four Pines Hostel. And inside were Palindrome and Rabbit, who had made it an extra five or so miles to the next road crossing before getting picked up. They were already eating Popsicles from the hostel. We pulled in and were immediately greeted by Joe, the owner of the house whose giant garage he's converted into a hiker hostel, as well as Big Country, a 350 pound hiker, and WhoDat, a red bearded and heavily tattooed thru hiker who has been very kind to me. People were playing cornhole and drinking soda and having a great time. For a place with just a suggested donation, this place freakin rules. Free sodas and freezie pops! And a guitar! I saw Klaus, an Austrian I haven't seen since the day before Greasy Creek, as well as Patchy and Polar Bear! I played guitar for a while before we drove to the Catawba Grocery where I had two pulled pork sandwiches waiting for me and picked up just a few snacks to get me through the day and a half to Daleville, as well as some beer. We came back and stuffed our faces and hung out. It was a lovely evening sitting in a lazyboy and sipping ipa. WhoDat decided to make pancakes at about 10 pm and lots of folks joined in. Klaus and 76 were especially enthusiastic. Quixote says she's making them in the morning. This hostel is pretty amazing, and essentially free! I will leave a generous donation in the morning.

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529025,"The Shenandoahs are on fire, apparently. The news broke last night that forest fires have shut down part of the national park in the very southern section, including fourteen miles of Skyline Drive and four miles of the AT. I'm hoping that all of it will pass will rain forecasted soon and with more than a week before I get there.Despite an ongoing battle with Patchy about whether the fan would be on or off, I slept very nicely on one of the couches that Joe has set up in the big garage-turned-hostel. I woke up to the smell of breakfast being prepared and was quickly handed two banana pancakes from Quixote. Amazing. My laundry was done and everything was ready. Lightning and I headed out slightly earlier than usual, and made our way over back to the trail and up and over a small first climb and descent before beginning the push up to the ridge where we'd spend the rest of the day. The hiking became much more difficult over the rolling ridge. We passed a very large group of old women hiking along the trail. Eventually we hit VA 311, where the day hiking trail to McAfee Knob begins, and the trail improved dramatically. It became a ""stroll in the park,"" as Lightning said, for four miles and we climbed evenly up to the famous overlook. Wow. The view is as spectacular as I imagined and more. Despite being very shallowly rising on the south side, the north side of the Knob falls away in cliffs and steeply, leaving a huge set of ledges with panoramic views into the valley below and the ridges beyond. The day was clear and perfect, and we could see the ridge we'd climb this afternoon and tomorrow into Daleville, as well as the first mountains outside of town, and away to the Blue Ridge. And who should I find up there but Hootie and Seeker! Seeker has been renamed Seaweed after he met another Seeker and his buddy Golden Snitch had to return home. They both seem to be doing well in their own right, though, and were planning for the big day into Daleville today. We, on the other hand, only had 6.5 miles left in our day and it was about 12. So we decided to chill. And chill we did, taking pictures, eating lunch and sunbathing with everybody else from Four Pines who made it up to the Knob. We stayed for over an hour there, and had a grand ole time. Quixote, Audubon, Lightning and I all got a selfie together. Eventually, after most other folks left, we decided we should push on. After a short talk with Gunslinged, a former thru hiker who has apparently spent the last two weeks just hiking back and forth between the Tinker Cliffs and 311, we headed back down to the ridge that would take us on. The trail was often quite hard to follow, and i got lost around one rocky outcropping and had to backtrack. Lightning, who had fallen behind, made the same mistake I did and we fell back in together as we finished off the steep and leaf-covered (frustrating) climbing to the Tinker Cliffs. The Tinker Cliffs view lacks the dramatic overhang, but it may even be better than McAfee Knob. Something about the way the ridge to the Knob snakes away into the distance, and the perfect offsetting of the pastoral fields and the huge mountains below, the fact that the sprawl of Roanoke is hidden, and the lovely hazy dying light of the afternoon, made it the perfect view. I told Lightning that the view made me feel more profoundly American and patriotic than I had in a long time, and he laughed at me. But seriously. This may be the first view that benefits from the human footprint on the landscape. I was reminded of a quotation from LBJ's inaugural that I've always wanted reaf by Sam Elliott: ""For this is what America is all about. It is the uncrossed desert and the unclimbed ridge. It is the star that is not reached and the harvest that is sleeping in the unplowed ground. Is our world gone? We say farewell. Is a new world coming? We welcome it, and we will bend it to the hopes of man.""We toyed with staying for sunset before deciding to just head down to the shelter and be with the gang. After one mixup in which we followed the old AT and skipped a switchback, and I decided to backtrack and Lightning didn't, we were down at the shelter. Palindrome and Rabbit were already here, as were Quixote and Audubon. Cabot and Hobbes rolled up later, as did 76, Brightside, and a flip flopper named Bald Whistler, or BW for short. Lightning decided to make himself the challenge of trying every flavor of pop tarts during his time on the trail, and we had a great evening. Tomorrow into Daleville for lunch and resupply, then back out for the last night before I get picked up by my dad and brother for three days of a comfy bed to come back to every night!","Four Pines Hostel

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529155,"I slept well last night and happily got out of my bag at about 7. I happily chatted with BW while we ate breakfast. He's doing his ""flip flop"" in a bunch of chunks, and it sounds like it'll be pretty beautiful, he's headed to Damascus now, but won't be back there til about September and then hike south. Lightning stayed in his hammock for quite some time and I was just about ready to go as he got up. I told him I'd see him at the BBQ place later on. The hiking was pretty easy all morning. The temperatures were cool and it was overcast and breezy. Perfect weather for me. The trail headed up and down along a ridge heading southeast towards the town of Daleville. There were a lot of good outcroppings with views to a lake nearby and down into the suburbs. I listened to a lot of Joni Mitchell and Bon Iver on the way, passed a couple groups of day hikers, and was soon on the major descent. I passed into a flat valley a mile or so out which was very pretty hiking. The leaves are just now coming out at the lower elevation, and they are still that wonderful bright lime green color before they darken. I passed a huge group of teenage kids before popping out into the heat and noise of US 220 and heading towards the plaza where an outfitter, a grocery store and Three Lil Pigs BBQ are all conveniently placed. I met up with Quixote, Audubon, Palindrome and Rabbit outside the outfitter, and went in and bought a freeze dried meal. I also looked at their sleeping pad situation: mine has been deflating very slowly over the course of the night, and I wake up with my ass or hips on the ground every morning. It's not a huge issue, but if they had had a pad I liked I might've bought it. But they didn't. We all headed over and got a table out on the deck at Three Lil Pigs and bought a pitcher of beer and ordered. I got a pulled pork sandwich, chicken tenders, curly fries, and hush puppies, which came with honey butter and were incredible. Lightning showed up right before our food came and fortunately he was able to order and get his basically at the same time as ours. Rabbit declared that the beer tasted pretty good despite being made by Americans. The restaurant also gives hikers free banana pudding, which we were excited to see came with nilla wafers and whipped cream and slices of real banana! It was a good place. Highly recommended. I headed to the grocery store and got just a few things. With my brother and dad coming tomorrow, I knew I didn't need a ton, but also don't want to force them to bring me to a grocery every day. So I've got enough for a few breakfasts and lunches. I then headed out on my own back to the trailhead. The section between the Daleville and Troutville road crossings was over a grassy meadow and was hot and exposed. The section after was though pretty pastures, then passed over a road and back into the woods. At a series of stiles, i stopped to make a sign marking the completion of a third of he trail!!! Woohoo! I was very excited for it and it's he best sign I've made so far. I pushed up the gradual climb up to Fulhardt Knob slowly, nursing my giant food baby from lunch. I stopped in at the shelter at about 4:30 before deciding to push on. I'd only done 14 miles and the shelter had no water at it. Not ideal. The hiking to Wilson Creek shelter was absolutely lovely. We are heading back to the land of individual mountains instead of long long ridges, which is a type of hiking I prefer. I can keep a pace better when I'm not having to change going up and down quickly. I listened to Court and Spark all the way through a few times and was there. Palindrome and Rabbit were already here, and we made dinner and talked. I set up my things in the shelter and was expecting to be the only one in it tonight until Audubon and Quixote rolled up at about 8. They usually tent, but rain is in he forecast starting at about 5am, so I'm happy to be inside. Lightning didn't show up. Apparently he wasn't able to replace his pack, but I hope he was able to repair it a little, because he now has to get to Waynesboro on that broken pack. Tomorrow looks very wet all day. But I will push on the miles through it and hopefully make it 17 miles to Jennings Creek (or maybe further?) and get picked up by my brother and dad! I'm really looking forward to seeing them! What with my break in Atkins, the lovely group I've been in the past week, and this visit, the Virginia Blues just haven't had any time to set in!","Lambert Meadow Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529368,"Palindrome and Rabbit continued their hijinks of waking up other hikers at 5:30 which I find not particularly funny. I went back to sleep and was up around 7. It was drizzling out, and I was not hugely motivated to get going and took my time. I was out by 8 behind Audubon and Quixote. It rained lightly all morning as I headed up and down pretty easy terrain. I did about 10 miles to Bearwallow Gap before even eating. The trail began to intersect and cross with the Blue Ridge Parkway, which provided a number of breaks and pretty spectacular views into the fields nearby and away to mountains, specifically the very recognizable tops of the Peaks of Otter. I was given a great deal of joy for some reason by the passing of the very occasional car along the wet and rainy pavement. I ate lunch at Cove Mountain shelter and met Jim Martin, a 74 year old who is a hundred miles or so from completing his goal of sectioning the AT through Virginia. I then made my way down to Jennings Creek, where the weather finally cleared into a sunny day. All along Cove Mountain i could see the fog rising off the ridges in a mystical and beautiful way. I went up and over Fork Mountain and found myself in a valley with trees and streams all around. And then it started to drizzle again, and I threw on my pack cover. Then it started to rain. Then i saw a flash in the sky and heard the boom of thunder. And it started to really rain. I had been taking it kind of slow, but I only had a half mile left to the shelter, and I kicked myself for not walking faster. Had I walked a little faster I might've showed up bone dry, but as it was, I was soaked. Bryant Ridge Shelter is astounding, a labyrinth of wooden posts and sleeping areas and porch over two floors. And there to greet me were Palindrome and Rabbit, as well as Polar Bear, Seaweed, Hootie, Bolt (whom I haven't seen since Hot springs), Babbit, and a number of day hikers, all staying out of the rain. I had about 45 minutes to kill before I pushed on along a blue blazed side trail nearby to meet up with my dad and brother at 5, so I tried to dry out and snacked. As the rain subsided, most of the hikers pushed on hoping to get to the next shelters, and Audubon and Quixote showed up. Palindrome set up his tent in the rain just to test how waterproof it actually is. He's a bit of a nutcase. Then 4:45 rolled around and I threw on my raincoat for the first time all day and headed down the trail.The blue blaze came up quickly and I climbed up and over a little ridge and found myself at a dead end dirt road trailhead. It was just past 5, and I hung out for about 20 minutes waiting for my dad to show up. I figured they were just late, but decided then to start exploring around the area to see if I missed a trailhead. I ended up intersecting them a little along the road at a strange place, but happily clambered into the car and tried not to smell too bad, to no avail. I felt ecstatic to be being whisked away somewhere warm and dry and in the company of family. We drove to an Airbnb stay in Buchanan where I got cleaned up and put in a load of laundry. We then headed out for dinner, and (unsurprisingly, knowing my family) ended up back at Three Lil Pigs BBQ. The ribs were even better than the pulled pork, and the hush puppies were still amazing. I even got a second serving of free banana pudding. We picked up a few cases of soda which my dad is going to leave as trail magic and headed back. Tomorrow, the plan is for an early wake up and for my dad to drive my brother and me to the trailhead where the two of us will start hiking north. My dad will drive up to another road crossing further on and will then backtrack to meet us and we'll all go together to the car, then we'll probably repeat the process once or twice through the day. Unfortunately, the afternoon is pretty devoid of road crossings, so we will have to choose between 15 and 25 miles tomorrow! We'll see how we're feeling! Great to be having this special treat on the trail!","Wilson Creek Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529916,"Slept pretty well on a couch last night, breakfast this morning was a giant affair with fresh croissants and a frittata. Eventually we made our way back to the Bryant Ridge side trail, and the three of us walked down to the AT and I showed them the big beautiful shelter. Dan and I then headed out up the trail. I still had my pack on, but didn't bring my sleeping bag, pad, stove or tent, so it was considerably lighter, and we made good time up a series of hills to where dad met up with us for the first time. He had donuts and soda, and had just met Lightning, Audubon and Quixote. We passed over Apple Orchard Mountain, over some pretty flat hiking with a few good views and down to Petite's Gap, where dad met us again, and we ate some lunch. It had been drizzling a bit in the morning but cleared up here. Dan said he wanted to keep going ten more miles with me, so we pushed up and over Highcock Knob and then along some very flat nice climbing along a ridge in the late afternoon light. We listened to Red Hot Chili Peppers the whole way and the music helped us out. I ran into Quick, whom I hadn't seen since Hot Springs: he flipped up to Harper's a few weeks ago from Atkins and will return when he gets back there. The descent down to the James River became hell on Dan's feet: I'm not sure exactly how he came out here and did 25 miles with me, but damn, he did. I lent him my poles so he could have an easier time and took his walking stick. At Matt's Creek Shelter we ran into Bolt and Babbit and followed them down to the James along a lovely creek. After a mile along the big river, the footbridge, the longest on the AT, came into sight. We were excited to see dad after his apparent car troubles, and Lightning, Audubon and Quixote were there too. Dan and I decided to take part in the tradition of jumping in off the bridge, then carried out stuff over to the car. The three others were looking for a way to get to Glasgow, and my dad offered dinner, so we (somehow) crammed six of us and all of our things into the tiny rental car and went to Don Tequila in Buena Vista, had a great meal and then dropped them off at the public camping in Glasgow. They're all planning to take tomorrow off, so I may not see them for a while. The three of us headed to our second Airbnb stay and crawled into bed. Dan said he was never hiking with me again.","Buchanan, VA via Bryant Ridge Shelter

We decided that Waffle House was for breakfast and ate ravenously. Dad and Dan drove me back to the James River and dropped me off. They did a little hike up to Matts Creek shelter while I began the toughest climb of the day up towards Rocky Row Mountain. The climb took a while, but my light pack helped a bunch. The ledges on top had an absolutely incredible view back towards Apple Orchard, the James, and the huge plain to my east. The hiking flattened out then was another climb up to Bluff Mountain, where I met Teflon, who gave me some gummy bears! I sped down to Punchbowl Overlook, where dad and Dan met me for lunch with cold cuts and water. I paid Teflon back for the Bears with a soda. Dan decided he wanted to hike with me, and we took off over the four mostly downhill miles to Reservoir Road. I had a freakout when I received a text from dad saying he couldn't get to the road crossing. Neither Dan nor I was happy about the idea of having to do 11 miles together with Dan's feet still hurting badly. Fortunately, dad was there at the suspension bridge, having found a way around. I took some nice pictures and ate a banana before heading out over the next 7 miles by myself. I cruised with the lovely terrain and my light pack and had a great great hike. The last few miles were next to Brown Mountain Creek, and were absolutely gorgeous. I like the creek hiking that has been common the last few days. I stopped in at the shelter just before the road crossing and said hi to White Rabbit and Large, and met Lucky Duck, Dill and Spidey. I made the last few miles to the road where dad and Dan met me with Krispy Kreme doughnuts and Bud Light Lime, two of my real weaknesses. I snacked and hung out in the sun. A southbound hiker came up to the picnic table after what was her longest day and we gladly gave her a beer and the rest of our sandwich makings. Her name is Five Weeks, for how long she has to hike during her vacation, and she was very nice to talk to. Hikers are always so appreciative of magic. We finally packed up and ate some burgers at Ruby Tuesday and stopped at Walmart for resupply before going home, where dad figured out how to connect our phones to the TV so we could watch the season premiere of game of thrones on the big screen!! I am going to try and keep up with the show as much as I can. I facetimed with Ali before heading to bed.

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529918,"Slept very well last night. I was exhausted, but very satisfied after a good day of hiking and game of thrones! I repacked my food bag and got all my things together and soon we were out the door. We saw that Country Cookin had a breakfast buffet, and went there instead of back to Waffle House. That was a mistake. It was a very limited buffet and very little about it was appealing. I had a lot of biscuits and gravy before we drove back out kicking ourselves for not going to Waffle House. Dad and Dan drove me back to the trailhead, where I saddled up my way-too-heavy pack. It was so nice to have this break to look forward to and to see them. On a more logistic note, their visit managed to break up an otherwise very awkward length of trail without good (or at least obvious) resupply between Daleville and Waynesboro. I am so happy to have had these days with them. The hiking up to Bald Knob was long and strenuous with my pack full and with 2 liters of water (I didn't want to go off trail for water, so I had 12 miles before the first source). After topping out at bald knob the day become a gentle rollercoaster of hills. Cole Mountain had a gorgeous bald meadowy area that may be the last bald we see on the trail (not counting the alpine zones in NH and Maine). I passed Sooner or Later and Large on the trail, and they caught up with me for lunch and we chatted. I also passed Spidey and White Rabbit. The highlight of the second half of the day was Spy Rock, a tall dome of rock next to the trail with very good views all around. Up there I met a couple from Richmond, one of whom knows New Haven quite well from having worked there for two summers. She took a picture of me with a film camera which she promises to send to Connecticut. The last miles of the day were pretty taxing on me, but I rolled up to the Priest shelter at about 5:20, and met three flip flippers from Harper's, Crystal Bird, Old Job and Monkey Dancer. I snagged a spot in the shelter and waited around for dinner because I wasn't hungry yet. White Rabbit and Blues Brother came in about 20 minutes after me. I haven't met Blues Brother before. He's a former soldier, and has a knack for making every story side-splittingly funny. He started the trail in early February I believe. Spidey came in and thought the flip flopper's name was Monkey Cancer, which had me in stitches for a while. Everybody made dinner and then hung out by a fire made by the Two Peas, some hikers whose entries I've seen for some time. Tomorrow morning will see me up and over the Priest in the morning, down to the Tye River 3000 feet below and then back up 3000 feet to three ridges. Yeesh. I am planning to stop after about 16 miles and hitch to Devil's Backbone Brewery, who allow hikers to camp outside and make them breakfast the next morning. It'll make for a long day into Waynesboro but seemed like an amazing experience.","Lexington VA via US 60

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530045,"Slept pretty poorly last night, but it was ok. Blues Brother and I packed up together before 8 am. Before we headed out I checked the register to read other hikers' confessions and found a two page passive aggressive rant from Monkey Dancer a directed essentially at the two of us. She especially had a problem with my leaving a Mylar space blanket in the shelter for another hiker to use; she came up to me earlier in the morning and asked me whether I ""really"" was leaving the blanket at the shelter. I said yes, and she rolled her eyes and said she'd pack it out for me. Get off your high horse. Someone else would've wanted it I'm sure, now it's going to be trash. Anyways. I climbed up the small way over the Priest (the last time we'll be above 4000 feet til Killington, VT) and began the long descent down to the Tye River. I accidentally scared the crap out of Large when i passed him. I met up with White Rabbit and Spidey at the river where we stopped and met with a ridge runner named Wood Elf who gave us clementines and took our trash for us. Good guy. We began the long long ascent of Three Ridges, about 3000 feet up to the summit, and the last mountain before Massachusetts with a single climb more than about 1000 feet. The climb up Chimney Rock was brutal, and the switchbacks made for one great moment in which i watched White Rabbit, Spidey and Blues all in my line of sight but spread out over 100 feet of climbing and probably a quarter mile of trail. We all ate lunch at the top of the mountain before heading down to Maupin Field Shelter, where we hung out for a very long time. Everybody had different plans for the day; White Rabbit and large were planning to go 7 more miles, Sooner or Later was considering waking up at 3 AM to get into Waynesboro at noon, and I was trying to get to Devil's Backbone Brewery just 2 miles away. Eventually White Rabbit and I headed out and I got down to the road at Reid's Gap. I called the brewery to see if anyone was free to pick me up, but no luck. It took me quite a while, but I managed to hitch a ride with a very old woman named Helena down the five miles to the brewery. The brewpub is a huge complex, with a stage and outdoor seating and a giant main building. I spent the next couple hours eating food, drinking beer and charging my electronics. I was shown where hikers are told to camp, but also was suggested by one waitress that I should just camp out under the big pavilion of the outdoor bar. I spoke with a big group of Quebecois bikers and had a very nice couple (whom I'd met before on the trail) pay for my dinner. They offered to drive me back up to the trailhead but as claps of thunder and lightning strikes began to happen, I decided to stay the night here. I spoke to another couple, one of whom has just been accepted into the Marine Corps Band, and drank some more beer before heading out for the night. Dill, PenDexter and Toast were inside the building and we casually indicated to each other that we all had the idea of camping under the outdoor bar pavilion. We headed out there together and hung out under the lights shooting the breeze and playing cornhole. Eventually most of the employees left, and we set up our pads and bags under the bar. We were worried by a man doing final rounds of the facilities, but he didn't seem to care that we were here. So that's where I'm staying the night.

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530191,"I slept pretty poorly last night until for some reason the two giant floodlights a hundred yards away got turned off. As the morning broke, I lounged around and slept in, knowing I would be waiting around for the 9:30 hiker breakfast anyways. Dill, Pendexter, Toast and I packed up as employees arrived, trying not to look like we'd just spent the night there camped out on the ground. Nobody gave us any trouble. Dill was adorably paranoid. At 9:30 we sheepishly entered the main pub area and were quickly seated at a table and handed more coffee and tea than we could possibly drink. We were soon joined by Wetbeard, Obi Trail Kenobi and Ski Pole, who hammocked out in the ""correct"" camping area. Breakfast was wonderful, a big plate of eggs, fresh bread, sausage and fruit. The coffee was delicious. We felt pretty pleased with ourselves for having been sheltered in from what seems like just a terrible storm up on the ridge, if White Rabbit's Facebook is anything to go on. Pendexter's grandparents showed up and brought the three hikers back to the trailhead. Wetbeard, Obi, Ski Pole and I piled into a truck driven by Tony, the ""head of hospitality"" at the brewery who brought us up at just about the same time. It was already 11 and I had 19 miles to do before town, so I began pretty much booking it down the trail. There were only a few small climbs today, mostly flat hiking, but the terrain was Rocky and tough in many places. My internal clock was thrown way off by my late start, but I cruised at above 3 miles an hour all day long, barely stopping. I pulled into Paul Wolfe shelter at about 4, met a sobo section hiker named Two Hip, and said hi to Fiber, who is staying the night here. I pushed on and about 3 miles in was greeted by the rain that had been forecasted all day. It came down consistently and totally soaked my clothes and legs and shoes. After a grueling hour of wet and clammy hiking, I pulled up to the Blue Ridge Parkway, in just about the worst fog I've ever been in. I could barely see 15 feet. Adam Stanley, owner of Stanimal's hostel, said he'd pick me up ""at the popcorn stand,"" but there was none in sight in the tiny radius I could see. I crossed over the highway before deciding to look it up on google. I found that the stand was actually below me on the state route, so I climbed down and across the road and waited a few minutes in the fog and was picked up! Adam hiked the AT in 2004, the PCT in 2010, and is a very fit, intense, but accommodating host. I only mention fit because it's about the first time a hostel owner has been fit. We chatted about new haven and the hostel, and he dropped me off at Ming Garden, the must-stop all you can eat Chinese buffet where a few hikers had already gone. I went inside and found Large, White Rabbit and Spidey, who, despite having finished eating, hung around and talked to me as I brought out plate after plate piled high with noodles and syrupy chickens goodness. They are all camped out at the pavilion ""tent city,"" which offers free showers at the nearby YMCA. The buffet was far more extensive than the one in Pearisburg, and an incredible deal at 10 bucks! Delicious.Adam graciously offered to pick me up again, and I headed over to the hostel, where I found Bolt and Sooner or Later, as well as a few southbound hikers. I chose a bunk and settled in. I struggled with the laundry machine for a while and apparently it is now broken. Adam assures me that this has been a LONG time coming. I did my wash in the sink. I facetimed Ali for a long time. I also had a conversation with Bolt and Sooner or Later about what to do with the fire detour. I was pretty sure I wanted to hike as far as I could along the trail and get shuttled around the fire by the Forest Service, but apparently the much more reliable shuttles are running from Waynesboro to Powell Gap. Nascar, a hiker I met around Hampton who hiked the miles from Rockfish Gap to the fire closure today, said he barely found a shuttle back out of the park. Sooner or Later had also been feeling the way I was, but finally was swayed because he is now planning a road trip back down here with his wife later in the summer to come complete the section he missed. When he returns, he says, he wants a real section of 40 miles to complete, not simply a 15 mile, one day cruise that barely merits the trip in the first place. That made some sense to me. I am not going to skip any part of the trail. I am here to walk in a continuous line from Georgia to Maine, and I will be coming back to the Shenandoah to finish it out at some point. So why not actually give myself a real section to complete when I do? I'll figure it out. Happy 50 days on the trail to me!","Devil's Backbone via Reid's Gap

By 5:55 I was up and moving about, and by about 6:20 I was out of the house on my way to breakfast and Kroger. The hostel is in a nice green suburban area, and the plaza either everything in it is about a 12 minute walk away. I stopped in at a bagel shop Adam recommended where Nascar, Bolt and Sooner or Later were finishing up. The breakfast sandwich was alright. I bought some groceries and headed back, and sat around on the verge of napping for quite a while. Lordy I didn't need to be up as early as I did. At 9:15, Adam drove Bolt, SoL and I over to the campground where the shuttles around the fire pick up hikers. It was rainy and gross outside and I was glad not be out camped in it. White Rabbit, Blues, Large and Spidey were all there and packing up. Blues had bought compactor bags and handed them around as Pack liners. At 9:30, the first of the ""10 o'clock"" shuttles showed up and took everybody but me Spidey and blues. We waited around and talked to some bicyclers and loaded up into a minivan that arrived just before 10. The drive was pretty long. I spose we had to go out of Waynesboro, then drive the equivalent of 40 miles of trail, then head up into the park. The fog just hung around the tops of the mountains in an impenetrable cloud. We were actually getting dropped at Swift Run Gap, six miles north of where the fire closure ends, and six miles north of where I thought we were getting dropped off. We stopped by the entrance station and filled out permits before driving a little more to a trailhead. It was funny just how little ceremony there was about starting the trail here, considering how much internal turmoil it's been causing me. I just got out of a van into a foggy day and started walking again. It was about 11:15. The terrain in the Shenandoah looks just like all the pictures. Gently graded dirt paths through wide shadowy green forest. Very easy on the feet and the legs. Unfortunately, we were also in a cloud today. It wasn't really /raining/ but everything was wet anyway. I moved pretty incessantly, pausing to eat a clif bar and then stopped into Lewis Mountain Campground, where I ate lunch on the porch of a cabin I definitely wasn't supposed to be eating lunch. I filled my water at a spigot, and remarked how someone (probably an employee) had taken the time to fill milk cartons full of water from the spigot (which came out very quickly and strongly), just so people wouldn't have to deal with the jet of water and maybe get damp. Not only is the water from a spigot, we are actually complaining that it works TOO well. I made my way down the very short but of trail to Bearfence Mountain Hut, and was greeted by all the folks from the first shuttle. I thought i'd find them here. The next shelter was 12 miles and the next campground, 8 miles away, charges 20 bucks per campsite. All a little tired and not wanting to move on through the crappy weather, we all decided to stay the afternoon and evening here. Spidey and Blues showed up soon after me. We sat around and joked a lot, made fun of Spidey's trips to the privy - Ming's Revenge - cooked, and had a good nearo. A hiker named Justin from Springer came by and cooked dinner, but moved on. There are three other section hikers here tonight, but only one in the shelter with all us thru people. Tomorrow, the plan is to wake up and break camp quite early and go have breakfast at Big Meadows Wayside, the first of a few food stands we will see throughout the Shenandoahs (that apparently sell very cheap beer, too).

My morning routine, I don't know how, but manages to be significantly slower than everyone else's, and everybody was out and I finished packing up while talking to Philip, the section hiker whom we stayed with and woke up. The morning was foggy and misty just like last night. I hiked quickly up and out of the shelter and into the cold misty morning. The hiking wasn't difficult, and I moved over the terrain. Everybody was hiking pretty fast and it took me quite a long time to catch up with Large and Blues. After a few hours of good hiking I turned off the trail up a gravel road then along Skyline Drive towards the Big Meadows Wayside. I pulled in just after 9. This wayside is incredible. It's like a diner and a camp store and gift shop combined. I sat down with White rabbit, Spidey and bolt and ordered eggs, sausage, potatoes, toast and pancakes. Breakfast hit the spot and the camp store was way more extensive than anyone was expecting. I could have brought essentially no food and still been pretty ok. We hung out together for a while outside and willed the sun to come out, which it did, kinda! Bolt, white rabbit and I paced each other over the next little bit and then took a break at an overlook where we had reception and the fog finally broke (we poked out above the cloud line). We split up over the next bit when I went to get water at Rock Spring Hut, and a few miles on I came to the turnoff for Skyland, the largest resort in Shenandoah. I wasn't planning on stopping in, but who should I see but Sooner or Later walking out. He apparently missed the turnoff to Big Meadows and decided to treat himself here instead. I was incredibly enticed by his description of the dessert, so I decided not to forego the chance to eat two non trail meals in a single day. As usual I felt like a fish out of water walking into the very posh dining room of Skyland and getting waited on. I ordered a big salad and then the dessert that Sooner recommended, the blackberry ice cream pie, which was pretty amazing. Treat Yo Self. As I walked out of Skyland, I found Bolt, Spidey, Large and Blues walking in. They were all in good spirits together. We were finally in the sunshine and having clear good hiking in the Shenandoah. As the trail began to descend off the higher peaks, though, the fog came back, and the wind was blowing enough that the condensation on the trees was coming down like rain. I moved down to Skyline Drive and then began to climb up to The Pinnacle. The fog wore off again up near the top, and I spent a very nice time laying out on a sunny rock drying off and enjoying the view down into the valley. I napped and watched the clouds roll down and disappear as they crested the Blue Ridge. I finally decided to push on the final mile to the shelter. The fog came back a few hundred used before the shelter. I found white rabbit there, who was extremely angry to hear that her father had gone to Skyland without her, as well as a ridge runner and a section sobo named Chilly. I talked with the ridge runner for a while. The four others showed up soon, and eventually we all made dinner. The fog burned off some and we were treated to a nice sunset as well as the company of a few very not-shy deer. It's been a good day.","Bearfence Mountain Hut

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530702,"They opened the southern section of the Shenandoahs today. I was pissed and disappointed that I missed it by /that/ much. I thought about trying to go back and do them, but 1) the logistics would be nightmarish, 2) my dad is suggesting a family trip later in the year and I would love to see the Park at a time when there is sunshine and views and 3) the idea of having a 2-day buffer between me and the pack of hikers behind me is attractive. Last night was the coldest we've had in quite some time. I am very glad still to have had my down jacket and hat. I didn't batten down the hatches of my sleeping bag, but still. It mighta been close. The morning was misty and rainy and gross, and motivation to get up and go was pretty low. I headed out before Blues and Bolt. I stopped by Mary's Rock, which clearly would have just a commanding view of the surrounding mountains on a Better day. As it was, I had a view of the tops of the neighboring ridges bathed in a sea of white cloud. A cloud which I proceeded to descend into. The hiking right before Pass Mountain Hut was just gorgeous, though, beautifully carved trail through wonderfully open forest, lovely and flat. We all managed to group together near there and talked for a while. We played Contact for a little bit, a game White Rabbit and I both know from camp and taught to the others. Made me feel like a school kid again. The morning became foggier and wetter, the condensation falling off the trees like rain. We stopped for everyone to catch up just before Elkwallow wayside, then headed up together. The wayside was a letdown from what we had seen at Big Meadows. It was less diner and camp store and more beachside snack shack and 7/11. Bolt and Blues were especially disappointed in the chili cheese fries. We froze our asses off eating it outside in the misty rain and cold because there was no indoor seating. We went back in somewhat with the intention of resupplying, but the discussion quickly turned to ""how can we get out of this miserable weather?"" Though we all felt good enough to go on, none of felt like being damp and cold for the rest of the evening at a shelter. After some fruitless discussions with the workers there about cabins to rent, Blues came up with Terrapin Station Hostel, a hostel near Front Royal that seemed to also run shuttles, and could therefore pick us up. As Spidey stuffed his face with food, we called him up. He was in the Park already and said he'd be happy to pick us up in half an hour. We needed some more time to discuss and said we'd call back. White Rabbit especially was unhappy; she gets very into planning her itinerary, and futsing with it frustrates her. But even she was convinced by the idea of getting to stay two nights at a hostel and slack pack tomorrow. So we called the owner Mike back, but we kept getting his voicemail. Half an hour of more passed before we reached him, by which time he had apparently just gotten home. He said he could come back and get us, but it would be another forty minutes. We sat around the wayside in the fireplace and showed each other our favorite pictures from the trail while we waited. Mike eventually showed up and we packed into his van. It's funny how group dynamics change my hike. I almost certainly would not be doing this on my own: six people have a hell of a lot more sway than one does, and the pull of sticking with a group brings me along, too. We drove the long way down out of the park to Front Royal and pulled in to Mike's house, the garage and basement of which he's converted into a hostel. He has no heat down here, but some space heaters and a wood stove fixed that problem pretty quickly. We sat around, took showers, did laundry, ordered pizza and soda and listened to a great deal of classic rock on the radio. It was a really enjoyable way to spend the afternoon, actually. Blues gave White Rabbit the task of writing up two different possible itineraries for the next week, which she took to with extreme fervor (she eventually came up with 6). We'll see how the next days turn out. Improvisation has worked well so far. That's my style.","Byrds Nest #3 Hut

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530931,"The crowd was up just as early as usual for our shorter day as we were for any other. I lounged around in bed as usual and finally put together a day pack for hiking from Elkwallow back to the hostel this afternoon. The small packs were used by others, so I just unloaded most of the gear from mine and used that. We drove down with Mike to Front Royal in the miserable rain and fog and resupplied at the Martin's, where I also bought some breakfast, and then headed back up to the trailhead. The rain was coming down seriously at Elkwallow Gap, and going out was not easy, but the idea of the warm shower and bed at the end of the day pushed me on. I led the group, but almost everybody kept up with my very fast pace because we were all carrying so little. There were a couple small climbs but nothing serious at all. The rain slackened off, and right before the climb up North Marshall Mountain, the clouds broke into a gorgeous day. White rabbit and I paced each other for that last bit of the day, while we created a few peaks and then descended back into the fog for the last flat fire road miles down to the hostel. We pulled in just before 2, having kept up a 3+ mile per hour pace for 5 hours. A good day. I heated up the rest of my leftover pizza. White rabbit had been sure that she would be able to convince her father to do 9 more miles on the day. I severely doubted it but kept that to myself. She did not succeed. I'm frankly amazed that they are still hiking together considering the difference in what they want to get out of the trail right now. Anyways. We sat around the hostel all afternoon napping and taking showers and talking. Eventually we got ourselves together and Mike drove us down to the Mexican restaurant whose portions did not disappoint. Spidey ate an entire slice of lime, rind and all, after I joked that he was going to eat everything. We all drove back up and drank beers and played Trivial Pursuit. The team of Mike and me destroyed the other team. Everybody else went to bed, but I stayed up and watched Game of Thrones. It was a fabulous episode. Tomorrow back to normal-ish hiking!","Terrapin Station Hostel via Elkwallow Gap

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531058,"As usual, the crew was up earlier than I was, and after my night of game of thrones and talking to Ali, I was pretty unwilling to move. By move I did, and despite my best efforts to be slow I managed not to be the last person out of the hostel. Spidey and I left together at just about 8 and headed back up to the AT through the foggy, rainy morning. We turned on to the trail and began a long descent to the road into Front Royal. The sun came out soon, the sky cleared and it became hot and muggy. It was an incredibly welcome change from the cold rain and mist we've been dealing with for the last couple of days. Right before the road, the trail was made of dirt and became extremely muddy and slick, a theme for the day. Past the road, the trail skirted the fence around a zoological institute then climbed a very gradual hill before dropping to Denton Shelter, one of the most beautiful shelters I've seen. It can probably sleep ten, but has a huge front porch with Adirondack chairs, a separate gazebo, a horshoe pit and a solar shower. The crew showed up soon after me and we all ate lunch there. We then descended to the road where Blues had just gone to meet his sister and mother for lunch. They had left us a huge cooler of trail magic, and we ate cookies and drank cokes next to a lovely stream. The climb up to Manassas Gap shelter reminded me a lot of Connecticut, actually. I stopped in for some water before pushing on through forests covered in Trilium, a beautiful orchid-like pale pink flower. It is in full bloom and just covers the forest floor. Eventually I made it up and past to the side trail Dicks Dome shelter, which included a serious amount of rock hopping over a creek at the end. The shelter is a tiny geodesic dome for space for about four people. And who should I find but Sooner or Later! We sat on the stoop of the shelter (which has part of the creek running right under it. We called the campsite waterworld) and chatted for a while about what he's been up to the past few days. White rabbit came by. We went to explore along a little trail where the PATC is about halfway through building a new shelter, to be called Whiskey Hollow. It has a nice platform and all the rafters, but only about a third of the roof. Not a real shelter option, but Bolt is hammocking under the roof, and Large has his tent set up there on the platform. Spidey claimed the last spot in the shelter and we cooked dinner. Pendexter, Dill and Toast showed up and camped across the creek. Blues showed up after lunch with his family but decided that he was night hiking to the next shelter. As soon as he left, it began to rain pretty seriously. The river swelled and became muddy, and Toast, who had apparently set her tent up in a stream, ran into the shelter wearing very little clothing and asked if she could sleep in the small area at our feet. We said of course and she moved her things in and dried off. She is talkative and funny and fitting five was not really any trouble. Tomorrow I'll hit the Roller Coaster, the last challenge in Virginia, a 14 mile section of steep ups and downs all pushed together. We'll see. I'll pass the 1000 mile mark and end up probably at Bear's Den Hostel, or maybe the Blackburn AT Center. Should be fun.","Terrapin Station Hostel via Chester Gap
",Dick's Dome Shelter,"May 02, Mon",19
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531267,"It rained almost all of last night, and we watched the river swell and turn brown and muddy before we went to bed. There was no rain this morning, though. I managed not to be the last one out of the shelter as Spidey took his time and sooner or later decided to sleep in because he only has 15 miles planned. The hiking was pretty easy all morning, but the ground was crazy wet. There were big areas of mud, which make hiking very slow with all the slipping, as well as giant pits of standing water that require slow navigation. Every creek became a technical Crossing requiring a lot of rock jumping. All of which reminded me of the Long Trail. Hrmph. I passed through foggy bald areas at Sky Meadows state park, crossed a major road and made it up and over to the Rod Hollow shelter turnoff, where I met Large. He and I walked to the start of the Roller Coaster, the big challenge of the day, 13 miles of back to back ups and downs that is Virginia's final parting challenge. Fortunately, there are enough water sources that you don't have to carry any, and the weather had improved dramatically. It was clear and humid and partly sunny. I really enjoyed the roller coaster, actually. With my family's giant thighs and calves, I'm built for steep hiking more than most folks, and the quick change in terrain kept me very interested and happy over the course of the day. I leapfrogged with dill, Pendexter and Toast, all of whom were planning to stay at Bear's Den like me. At Sam Moore shelter I found White Rabbit and stopped for a late lunch. Large wasn't far behind, but I headed out soon after he arrived. Only four tenths past the shelter, nearing the top of one of the roller coaster's last peaks, I came upon a small wooden sign nailed to a tree that simply stated ""1000."" My celebration was hesitant given that I have indeed missed 45 miles of trail with the fires, but my elation was real. It's not every day you pass such a milestone. I took my picture and headed up and over a few more climbs to find the turnoff for Bear's Den Hostel. I had been considering pushing on 8 more miles, because I felt great, but it began to sprinkle as soon as I saw the blue blaze. After a fiasco of finding the entrance, I headed inside the big stone lodge. I was greeted by Blues, as well as a group of around 8 section hikers from Indiana all crowded into a tiny room with clean looking bunks, carpet and a refrigerator. They are all staying in a bunkroom upstairs, but the hostel does not open until 5 pm, so they were waiting around. I stood for a while feeling very damp before sitting down on the floor. Nothing against these people, they were very kind, but I was amazed that no one offered me their seat given that they'd been there for what looked like an hour already. I was even more surprised when two older section hikers and Dill and Toast came in and likewise sat on the ground and they did not move. Anyways. 5 rolled around and we were finally left to our own devices. People took turns showering, I checked in upstairs and quickly availed myself of the guitar they have laying around. Dinner was pizza and ice cream, part of the ""hiker special"" deal they offer. I played guitar for Dill, Toast, Pendexter and White Rabbit for a while, got my laundry done, called Ali and got ready for bed. In the basement they had a video playing from a thru hiker in 2003 and I watched him hike from Pennsylvania to Katahdin in the space of half an hour. It's gonna be a little longer for me I think. Tomorrow I'll hike the last few peaks of the Roller Coaster before following the VA/WV border and then finally saying goodbye to Virginia and heading down into Harper's Ferry. And by a happy coincidence, I'm hitting Harper's exactly two months after I began the trail!","Dick's Dome Shelter
",Bear's Den Hostel,"May 03, Tue",18.20
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531421,"I slept in while everybody else shuffled around this morning. As I finally got out of my sleeping bag, I said to Bolt, ""dang, I'm surprised no one took advantage of the make-your-own-pancake breakfast."" He looked puzzledly at me and told me that they'd all already eaten and packed up before I'd even moved. Huh. People headed out and I went upstairs and cooked pancakes for me, Dill and Blues. The griddle was still hot, and Dill found a jar of Nutella in the community cupboard, so we had a delicious and very sweet breakfast. I packed up and managed not to be too terribly behind everyone. The day was wet and rainy as it has been. It took me 6 minutes to cross the road at Snickers Gap, easily the busiest road crossing we've had. The last few climbs of the roller coaster weren't anything to write home about.I enjoyed the section on the whole, actually. During the second to last climb, we passed briefly into West Virginia, which we skirt for the next set of miles. The final climb out onto the ridge put us back into a cloud of dense fog that lasted for quite some time. I barely stopped during the section. The day cleared after about 8 more miles, but everything was damp all day. Many places along the trail were flooded and required a lot of jumping around to avoid huge puddles and pits of mud. Yich. Because the ridge before Harper's was in limbo between Virginia and West Virginia and between easy and hard hiking, I nicknamed it Harpergatory. I passed Key's Gap, where a dead deer on the side of the road scared the crap out of me, and made my way to Loudoun Heights, where the trail finally passed out of Virginia for the last time. So long, Virginia! Seriously. It's been more than a month since I entered at Damascus. It's time for some new states. The trail dropped down pretty seriously to the Shenandoah River, which is brown and swollen from all the rain. I walked along the crowded highway and admired the cliffs of Harper's Ferry and Maryland Heights. It's a very obvious strategic place, geographically. No wonder it was so important in the civil war. The sun was out fully as I climbed over the sides of the steep hill South of Harper's Ferry. I made it to the turnoff for the ATC and climbed up to a beautiful lawn and made my way through the half residential half national park town of Harper's Ferry. I recognized all the packs outside the ATC and came inside to find Spidey, White Rabbit, Large, Bolt, Sooner or Later, Blues and a few others milling about. I looked around and then got my picture taken for the catalog of thru/hiker photos that they keep. I am the 104th Nobo from Springer who has checked in at the ATC this year. A heck of a difference from 357+ at Amicalola. I am very glad to be this far ahead of the main crowd of folks. I sent a postcard with my picture on it. Spidey kindly invited me to stay with him at the Econo Lodge, where his grandmother (who is now following my journal!) had paid for a room for him to stay! I told him I would almost certainly be there, but I had a few errands. I headed down High Street to the old town and stopped in at Cannonball Deli for a chicken Parm before heading to the General Store that is the best outfitter in the town. I picked up a new set of tips for my poles (which are now on the third set for this trip, I can't explain why) as well as a shirt to get me through the next couple weeks. I love my merino smart wool shirt to death, and want to get the exact same one, but man oh man, the sleeves and armpits are torn to shreds. As I was cashing out, Large and White Rabbit showed up with their friend who was meeting them here. I amazingly bummed a ride off of them back up the big hill to the ATC where I'd left my pack, and over to the Econo Lodge. I bumped into Toast in the entryway and made a plan to meet her, Dill and Pendexter in 40 minutes for (second) dinner. I went up to the room and found Spidey looking clean as he's been for the last couple days. I showered, put on some new clothes and put in a load of laundry before meeting up with the gang to walk to a pub Dill had found on Apple maps. Never trust Apple maps. Or Canadians.  Dill led us up a big hill and then a third of a mile along a residential street to where Siri told her there should be a bar. There was no bar. There was no indication on the internet that a bar was ever there. She was incredibly apologetic, but we headed back to a restaurant we passed called the Anvil and ate dinner. I ordered too much and was happy about it. We walked back to the hotel. I went upstairs and affixed my new tips to my poles, using the boil method just like last time (worked like a charm). Spidey had been Permethrin-ing his clothes. I talked to Ali for a while (Spidey agreed, she's pretty awesome) and got ready for bed. Tomorrow I'll head back along the trail towards the ATC and then down to the old town and the Potomac, where I'll enter Maryland! Woohoo, new state! Not sure how far I'll get, but I've got Vicki, a trail angel, bringing me snacks in the middle of the day! It's been a good evening.","Bear's Den Hostel

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531582,"Spidey woke up at 6:30 this morning to go ""eat everything"" at the continental breakfast as soon as it opened. He then came back and went to sleep. I went down nearer to 8:30 and had breakfast with toast, Pendexter and dill. Pendexter is hanging around for another day or more, and Toast and Dill have some errands to run. So it may be a while before I see them again. I ate some biscuits and gravy and some oatmeal and headed back upstairs to pack up. I had a new shirt, new pole tips (my third set, this is getting ridiculous) and was ready to go! The econo lodge finds itself on the west side of town, so the first part of the day was back over the section I did yesterday, but soon I passed the ATC cutoff and headed down into the lower town. Harper's Ferry is a pretty neat place, and I loved the view over the descending rooftops down to the Potomac River. I ran into Large and White Rabbit, who invited me to breakfast, but I declined, as I knew I had something even better coming my way: Vicki, a legendary trail angel in Maryland, has been reading my journal the past couple of days, and incredibly kindly offered to put together some magic for me at lunch today. I got out of town slightly later than I wanted, so I moved quickly over the first set of miles to get to Gathland State Park, where she was meeting me. I crossed the Potomac and found myself down along the river for the next three miles on the C&O Canal Towpath, which Rambunny had assured me are ""the only flat miles on the AT."" And flat they were. I listened to music and passed by runners and bikers enjoying the cool morning. Maryland! There was very little pomp about entering the state, but it's a good 'un. The trail was consistently pretty beautiful today, wide and well taken care of (with the exception of a few very muddy bits). I ran into Bolt during my race to Gathland state park and we must've averaged over 3.5 miles an hour trying to get to trail magic. Gathland state park comes out of nowhere, but is beautiful, and with a parking lot and a big pavilion, it's a great place for trail magic. We were immediately met by Vicki, who gave me a big hug (despite my sweat) and Blues and Sooner or Later, and the party began. Vicki rolled out hot subs from a local Greek restaurant, fresh chips and guacamole, fruit galore, sodas, cookies - it was an astounding spread, and the four of us were just astounded at our luck. The subs were delicious (my favorite being the chicken souvlaki), and she insisted that we all take everything with us, so we filled up Goodie bags for later (I had also been handed a chicken Caesar wrap by a group on a tour bus, so dinner was all set for tonight). We also left some food for Spidey and Large and White Rabbit! We all agreed that this was the best trail magic we could ever have imagined, let alone seen! Vicki, thank you so much! You made this an absolutely incredible day. On a different note, Vicki had been in contact today with Slim, a thru hiker from 2014, whose journal (which I read compulsively over the summer of 2014) inspired me to hike the trail. Slim has also been reading my journal, and Vicki made him some amazing trail magic when he passed through two years ago. Vicki read me some advice that he meant to give me, which included pushing hard through Pennsylvania and not getting the ""midpoint blues."" I felt like I was in the presence of trail gods: it's so incredibly cool to me that these people I've only read about and imagined through journals not only EXIST in real life, but they're taking an interest in ME! I felt like I was being judged and given the blessing of some all-powerful syndicate in charge of the thru hikers. It was a special special feeling. Vicki, I can't thank you enough. I wish you all the best. We pushed on from Gathland in food comas (I yawned a LOT later today), trying to do 13 miles to Pine Knob Shelter. It took a lot out of me, but I made it. The highlight of the afternoon was passing by the original Washington monument, a milk-bottle shaped stone tower with a spectacular view away to Antietam and West Virginia. The sky was very overcast, but did not detract from the wide ranging view down into the valley next to us. It began to drizzle as I passed I-70, but I didn't get very wet as I pulled into Pine Knob Shelter (from which you can still hear the highway). I found Double Dip and Dirtface here, whom I had met briefly in Atkins. Hooray, catching up to people! (On that note, Seal Tree, Dr. Trails, Frost and Rain Man are only a day ahead of me!) they were very excited to see Sooner or Later when he pulled in, as they spent quite a bit of time with him, but hadn't seen him in over a month! This was a late arrival for me, just before 7, but I'm happily in the shelter for the night, where I'll be protected from the rain. So yeah. Maryland. It's hard to think about in the moment, but it's just about halfway done. I'm having a great time. I've really enjoyed the last few weeks on the trail in this little bubble. Blues brought up an interesting point. At the beginning of the trail, we were incredibly hesitant to call ourselves ""thru-hikers."" But down the road, we wont be able to say ""I'm a thru hiker,"" we'll always say ""oh, I thru hiked in 2016."" I Won't be able to say it in the future so why not take advantage now? Yeah. I hiked from Georgia to Maryland. Right now, I'm a thru hiker.","ATC Headquarters, Harper's Ferry

I usually use other people as my alarm clock, but that makes for some variable wake up times. Most of my night last night was spent dodging leaks in the roof, which kept splashing me in the face and legs. I moved my pad around many many times. I must have missed the leak hitting me in the right chest, because my bag was soaked there. Eh. Still probably better than what would've happened in my tent. I managed not to be the last one out today, actually. Maryland has some beautiful trail. Most of it is very wide forest corridor with good dirt or gravel footing. But we hit some very serious sections of rocky, wet trail today that even stopped me in my tracks. Even the ridges of southern Virginia aren't like this. It just takes such care to find footing. I think this is what I've got to look forward to later in Pennsylvania. It started raining at around 10 am and didn't stop. All. Day. Recently, with the addition of all the flip floppers from Harper's, we've met a bunch of newbies on the trail. Some are pretty conscientious, but others, like some I met at Raven Rock Shelter today, do stupid shit like accidentally set someone else's pack on fire with their stove... (Wasn't my pack.) the stop in at Raven Rock really took it out of me: I started getting very cold and hearing other people talk about getting out of the weather made me want to. But Bolt and I kept going and soon I warned back up and felt better. Eventually we came to Pen-Mar park and took refuge from the rain under a pavilion with a stage in it. Double dip and Dirtface and blues were all there. Soon after, we crossed the Mason-Dixon Line and officially entered ""The North"" and Pennsylvania! Hooray! State seven! The border was cute and had a little sign and a little mailbox but it was still raining badly so I didn't stick around. The hiking was pretty easy from there to Deer Lick Shelters, two identical 4-person shelters right next to each other. Sooner or Later was already here, and Blues and Bolt pulled in soon after. I'm in one shelter with two Guys named Paul and Ray who are out section hiking as a preparatory trip for an excursion in two weeks in which they will try to do all of the AT in Pennsylvania in only 10 days. They've never backpacked before and averaging 23 miles a day for 10 days seems super ambitious. They're also putting themselves in the belly of the beast in terms of overcrowding from AT hikers. Yeesh. The rain is still going strong at 9 pm. This has been the wettest day I've had yet. Tomorrow, this group and I will get up on the early side and make it 13 miles into Fayetteville, where we'll do some laundry, eat some lunch, resupply and regroup. We'll probably push past if the weather holds, but may end up at the hostel there. It's been a while since we've dried out.","Pine Knob Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531894,"At about 9:15 last night as the rain was letting up, three hikers showed up to the shelter and I scooted over to make some room. I was amazed to see that it was Magic! I haven't seen him literally since Hot Springs. He was with Odysseus and Puzzles (whom I met briefly on Big Bald). He had lost the group he was with because they decided to do the four state challenge (44+ miles from the edge of Virginia to the edge of Pennsylvania) and he chose not to. They had apparently just spent all day hottubbing courtesy of some massage therapist who picked them up at PenMar. They pushed on for the night, but I hope to see him again (and in the daylight). Paul and Ray were up decently early this morning and as they left and nodded goodbye I got up and began moving around. It wasn't raining, and it only drizzled on us during the day, but yesterday was so crazily wet that we just wanted to let ourselves dry out somewhere, so the plan was just to head thirteen miles to Fayetteville, where we could do laundry and hang out for the night at a church hostel. We all hiked as a clump together almost the whole day, trying to stick together so we could get picked up for Fayetteville together. The big news is that Sooner or Later's new red headband has turned his hair pink. It's very fashion-forward. The shelters farther along the trail were quite nice. There was one decent uphill and a few sections of really tough rock hopping. I spose that's what I'll have to get used to in the next weeks: steep climbs followed by miles of rocky tough ridge line. We passed a huge group of Boy Scouts as we made our way down to US 30, where, after about the tenth time of her not being able to hear me on my end of the phone line, we were picked up by a woman who works at the Trail of Hope hostel and ministry. We drove in the back of a flatbed to the hostel down the road. The sun - which we are all now calling Bob, short for the Big Orange Ball (apparently an Army thing) - finally came out. We brought our things into the hostel and were showed around. It's a nice converted house, and the price is right, actually. Next door is their church that according to Google Maps used to be a Mexican restaurant. It looks the part. There is a sign on the door that tells you that you will be asked to leave the premises if you take the Lord's name in vain. We all took showers and convinced the hostel workers to drive us into town to the laundromat and Dollar General. I also followed Blues' example and did a pre wash of my socks. Goodness. I will never just put my socks in the washer straight again. I washed my socks in a bucket with about two liters of soapy water, then two rounds of just clean water. Each time, the result was water black like coffee. It is just incredible the amount of grime that has accumulated on those things. Yich. Blues, Bolt, Sooner and I got driven in the same pickup down to the laundromat where we put our clothes into wash and went next door to an Italian restaurant where a sassy waitress (who happened to know Ansonia, CT, right next to where I'm from) served us delicious delicious food. The top of the list was loaded fries, which had cheese, bacon, and green onion. I had a chicken Parm sub and onion rings. We went back and dried our clothes and ended up waiting around for them then just deciding to walk to Family Dollar while our clothes finished drying. The walk was pretty far, and when it turned out at the end of our disappointing resupply that the driver could just bring us to Walmart five miles down the road, we were all a little pissed. We walked back to the laundromat and collected our clothes, met the fattest chihuahua we'd ever seen that belonged to a woman with green hair then got picked up to go to Walmart. I tried to move quickly through my resupply and that combined with the fact that I didn't know how much food I had left meant I ended up with WAY too much food for the next section. It's depressing to have to leave food behind, but I will almost certainly be doing just that when the morning comes. I have about 4 days' worth of food and Awol's itineraries suggest I needed only 2 from Harper's Ferry to get to Duncannon (because of food you can get along the way). Eh. We went across the parking lot next door where there was a potluck dinner waiting for us. I'm not sure what they usually do for dinner, but there was a gospel music concert tonight and about 20 people were eating dinner together. It was chicken tetrazzini, salad, and a lot of dessert options including something called ""fat lady salad"" which is essentially pistachio pudding. We chatted amongst ourselves and talked about how we four were taking this somewhat foreign experience in stride. We also met Gary, a flip flopped from Utah with whom I chatted for a while while the others went back to the house. As Nobos from Springer, our relationship with flip floppers is strange. And usually strained. It'll probably become easier as time goes on, but right now the two groups couldn't be more different. Backpacking is old hat to us. There are always new challenges to be met, but we are working with a two month of basis of dealing with backpacker problems. The flip floppers have about 60 miles under their belt. They are probably hitting their first resupply, and things are starting to shake out: gear is proving itself to be good or useless; bodies are starting to hurt. Every flip flopper we've met clearly wants to be counted an AT hiker. Like this other guy at the hostel whom we met. He started at Harper's but has been holed up here for a day or two waiting on some antibiotics for a kidney infection he developed. He describes it as: ""oh yeah, had to take a break from the trail for a few days,"" but to us, he hasn't even started yet! His hike is on a pause right at the beginning. I'm not going to say there's animosity between the groups, but with other Nobos from Springer, there is such a wealth of shared experience - you might know so and so, did you stay at such and such - that is completely gone when talking to flip floppers. They want to be considered real hikers after a week, and must feel shut down by the fact that we can't see them as such. Conversely, we have a nagging resentment when they try to bring up hardships they've faced and find common ground with us. It can only get better, I'm sure, but right now, it's not that we're not on good terms, it's that we're not speaking the same language. I facetimed Ali for quite a while. I miss her deeply, but being able to talk to her like this makes everything a lot better. I'm really excited to see her again when I head home in a couple weeks. It's funny thinking that I literally had not going a single day without hiking since I got back on Atkins. Seems like decades ago. In the space of a few days, we've got from Virginia, a state I've visited once, that seems impossibly far away from home, so obviously Southern, to Pennsylvania, where I've visited numerous times, and seems so close to home. Tomorrow we'll get out and head back to the trailhead and do our first long day of hiking in PA. Not sure where we'll finish, but we will be passing the 2016 halfway point!!!

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532031,"Sooner woke me up just before 6. They wanted to make an early start and pancakes were already being made by one of the long-term stays people there. The pancakes were delicious. I packed up. My food bag was toooo heavy. AWOL suggests you need two days of food from Harper's to get to Duncannon because of all the extra food on the side. I have about four days of food. I an two days from Duncannon. Yeesh. We got driven back the short ride tothe trailhead. We could already tell it was gonna be a gorgeous day. We walked through Caledonia State Park then up the only tough climb of the day, where I pulled ahead of most folks. I started walking behind a hiker who had a Deuter pack I thought I recognized. Palindrome! I caught up with him, he's been hiking along since Harper's, but has been making big miles to get to Pine Grove Furnace by Sunday, since they won't open on weekdays until May 15. I also ran into Spidey Large and White Rabbit since they pulled ahead of us when we got off in Fayetteville. White Rabbit sprinted ahead, exhilarated by the idea of making it to the halfway point, in just a few miles. I followed close behind her and gave a loud whoop when I got there, scaring some section hikers. They took a picture of me. Since the midpoint moves around, they just had a little sign on a post marking the ""2016 midpoint."" I walked on and off with Large, Spidey and Palindrome down to Pine Grove Furnace state park, and pulled into the general store, home of the Half Gallon challenge, in which hikers attempt to eat a half gallon of ice cream in under an hour. Given that ice cream doesn't sit well with me even in small doses, I decided to order a burger and fries. Which was delicious and a good choice. Palindrome motored through a half gallon of chocolate ice cream, but Spidey stuttered out just before the end. This was surprising since he regularly eats jars of Nutella in a single sitting. I headed out before most folks, wanted to still get in at a reasonable time to James Fry shelter, still 7.3 miles away. Also, I knew waiting for me there would be Frost, Rain Man, Dr. Trails and Seal Tree, whom I haven't seen since Atkins! The terrain was quite easy and I made good time, despite my knee hurting me a little. I rolled into camp at just about 5:45 and was greeted by the raucous voices of the four hikers I hadn't seen in now just over a month! They all seem to be doing well, they've been taking it a little slower recently (including Seal Tree's five days off in Waynesboro). They played euchre all evening. I cooked up a tasty ramen chicken dinner (with my new spoon), called my mom for Mother's Day and talked with Ali for quite a while. White Rabbit and Large showed up and I think Spidey and Palindrome are camped down by the water source. Today has been my longest day so far, my first longer than a marathon! It was an absolutely gorgeous day, and I had so much fun. I live for days like this.","Trail of Hope Hostel via US 30

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532232,"Everybody got up around the same time this morning, 6:30 or so. I felt badly about last night because I managed to drop both my pack and my stove from a good height while some folks were trying to sleep. No more top bunk for me for a while. The morning started with easy downhill and then shifted into the largest set of climbs and descents we've had in PA. Which isn't saying much. We pushed through a place labeled ""the Rock maze"" in which the trail wove through a number of tall rock formations. The trail planners clearly had fun making it, and I spose it was fun to hike. I paced White Rabbit and Frost all morning. After one more push up a we began the descent into Boiling Springs. A few miles before town, we hit a set of open farm fields covered in wood scraps, the start of Cumberland Valley; the trail leaves the last remains of what is the Blue Ridge further south and cuts due north across Pennsylvania to reach the long ridges that run east to west across the state. What is left is a huge section of flat trail with no camping and little water. I felt very lucky to have overcast and cool weather for our crossing: Thursday would've been miserable in the heat or even just the sun. I walked with Doctor Trails, Frost and Rain Man and we pulled into Boiling Springs together, and laid out stuff down at the regional offices of the ATC. We stopped in at the outfitter (where I purchased a gas canister that turns out does not work with my stove, I learned after testing it) and then went to lunch at Cafe 101, where we met Magic and Puzzles, who were taking it easy after their four miles into town this morning. I ate a delicious Reuben and an apple dumpling and went back to the ATC and packed up. I listened to Grizzly Bear's discography as I passed through fields, small stands of woods and brush between fields, through backyards, over interstates and railroads, on bridges, in tunnels, all this madness of the Cumberland Valley. There are about 12 miles of the flat ground outside of Boiling Springs, and it took a long time. My knees were yelling at me for pushing them tomorrow and today, and the last few flat miles were a little stiff. I sped up as I began climbing again towards Darlington Shelter, the goal for the evening (and the destination for just about everyone from last night, after Frost and the gang decided 12 into Boiling Springs was not enough). I created the first long ridge we've encountered in PA and headed to the shelter. It's another nice shelter, and I've got a spot on the floor, rather than the bunks. In case I drop anything, ya know. Around 7:15, a trail runner rolled up and, to everyone's great surprise, offered us cookies and sodas that he packed up for whoever was staying the night here! His name is Patrick, he lives nearby, and extremely kindly offered advice for Duncannon as well as a shuttle for whoever needed one. He also picked me out immediately as Portage as he apparently reads my journal! Thanks so much Patrick! Your magic really brightened our evening. Frost and I bonded over love of H Jon Benjamin and the show Bojack Horseman. Doctor Trails rolled up after taking his time in Boiling Springs, and we were all in the bags by 9. It's been pretty cold the last few nights!","James Fry Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532399,"I heard some shuffling this morning and woke up to orange and pink lift pouring in from a beautiful sunrise. Then I went back to sleep. A defining moment in my hike. It was drizzling as we packed up this morning. The forecast called for scattered showers all day, but I managed to stay almost completely dry. The trail descended the ridge and through a set of pastures towards the ridges that we'll be following almost due east for the rest of Pennsylvania. The hiking was pretty easy, and despite Awol's warning that the ridge would be ""very rocky,"" I moved quickly up and over the ridge before Duncannon. I paced with Dr. Trails and Rain Man for the final flat ridge walk and descent into Duncannon and began the road walk into town. The sense of humor of this group is far closer to my college friends than any other I've encountered, and makes me feel pretty at home. We passed through the streets of Duncannon and ran into Magic and Puzzles and made our way over to the Doyle Hotel, one of the oldest institutions on the trail that has always catered to thru hikers. I was given the advice that the Doyle is a place to visit rather than stay, and a single look at the outside convinced me of it; the windows are all busted out, the whole place looks dirty and falling apart. We rolled in at about 11:15 and were greeted to a unique sort of service. Essentially Pat and Miss Vicky - who I assume must own the place - moved at their own pace and decided to finish their coffee before allowing us to even order anything. Eventually we managed to convince her to pour us a few beers and put in an order for a couple of burgers. They seemed to be out of half of everything on the menu, and it didn't seem like an uncommon occurrence. The beer was cheap and the burger was good, but when you've been trying to get your check for 25 minutes while Miss Vicky chats up a local, it's not easy to feel kindly about the place. White Rabbit, Large, Spidey, Blues and Bolt showed up. We eventually paid up and were packing up for a while in their billiard room and were berated by Pat about keeping our stuff off the pool table and not throwing out our trash in the bathroom trash can. He essentially told us all that we were idiots without common sense enough to pick up after ourselves. Doctor Trails ended up bringing the entire bathroom trash can out to the dumpster in full view of Pat to try and show him that he was being ridiculous. We left soon after with full bellies, but feeling more than a little miffed at the staff of the Doyle. The place needs a makeover, inside and out. We did a bit of resupplying at a convenience store nearby then Seal Tree, Frost, Dr. Trails and I walked the rest of the road walk through town and across the Juniata and Susqehana rivers. The whole road walk must be the longest we've had, just under 3 miles. We finally made it back into the woods and began climbing steeply up to a ridge. Seal Tree realized he'd left all his electronics at the Doyle and called back there to see if any hikers were left. No such luck. His only recourse seemed to be to go back the miles (about 2.5 at that point) to the Doyle. To my amazement, he decided to push on 2.2 up and up to the shelter with us over easily the most challenging rocks we've seen yet before turning around. I would've just dropped my pack there and gone back, but Seal Tree is a different breed than me. He headed out from the shelter and apparently ran all the way down and back up, though he managed to hitch across the two bridges on the way back. But he was there and back FAST. crazy fast. The other three had taught me how to play euchre in the mean time. Doctor Trails and I lost by 1 point to frost and rain man. It's a good game, similar to pitch which i know. I had some fun.  Seal tree showed back up and we all made dinner together and got into our bags. White Rabbit came in a little later with the information that apparently someone had set fire to Peter's Mountain Shelter, 7 miles away from us. Blues apparently came up to the shelter and found someone running away from the shelter having just set it aflame. We are really not sure what's going on, but I hope nobody got hurt and everything will be ok.","Darlington Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532798,"I managed to be up earlier than anyone else after one of the best nights of sleep I've had in a long time. I think I need to start blowing up my mattress more, I slept quite a bit better despite the crowded shelter. Nothing came of the crazy man who set fire to Peter's Mountain shelter, though I did have a small freak out when I could see my own breath this morning and thought it was smoke rising from the floor of the shelter. I packed up and was out by 7:45. The hiking was pretty darn easy all day, a lot of flat ground, small climbs, and rocks that were not so bad. I stopped in at Peter's Mountain with Frost to look at the damage. The arsonist seems to have lit the trail register on fire and used that to burn up a sort of curtain that hangs across the porch of the double-decker shelter. The curtain was charred to bits all over the shelter and ground, and the picnic table inside was covered in ash. Fortunately, none of the living space beyond that seems to be affected in the slightest. Good on Blues for saving the place. The trail's constant changing between ups and downs and rocks and no rocks held my attention well, and I had a fun day hiking. I stopped for lunch at Clark's Mountain Road with Compost, a Nobo whom we've just met after he took a week off from the trail. Unfortunately, the ball of my right foot started to get incredibly sore as the day went on. I tried to be ginger with it and make sure that I was placing it only in good spots, but I can only do so much; about ten times today, I managed to step on little rocks in EXACTLY the wrong place and was put in some serious pain for minutes at a time. I gave it a nice massage at the end of the day, but I've got to be careful with it, maybe even get some thicker insoles. I made it down to Rausch Gap Shelter just past 5 and met Rigby and Roller, two flip-flopping women whose notes I've seen in the trail registers. The shelter itself is pretty amazing. Rebuilt in 2012, it has a stone foundation with a towering wooden canopy (surprisingly can only fit 6 people though), as well as perhaps the best shelter water source on the whole trail: a large piped spring that pops out of a stone wall they've built and dumps into a metal trough, literally fifteen feet from the shelter itself. Amazing. Blues was also here, and was about to lay down for a nap after his restless night last night. As everybody showed up over the next half hour, he recounted the story of what happened last night. As he approached the shelter, he heard a man shouting expletives and threats, and slowed down because he was worried he'd run into something bad. The shouting stopped and he passed a man heading south who told him ""I'm sorry you had to hear all that,"" and moved on. Blues approached the shelter and was very weirded out by what he thought were multiple fires lit outside the shelter, but when he saw smoke billowing out, he dropped his pack and went running towards the shelter, looking to see if anybody was trapped or hurt inside. When he found no one in the shelter, he beat the fire out with a broom that was laying around, and fortunately had about two liters of liquid in his pack (including one Powerade) that he managed the put the fire out with. He called the police, and apparently hung out with his knife out - he didn't know whether the man would come back, or whether the actual arsonist was still around. The police showed up hours later in the complete darkness and really couldn't do much. So Blues spent the night in the smoky shelter, and left a note in the shelter for the next folks telling them a little of what happened (explaining the giant piles of ash). We cooked dinner, Blues headed out after his nap and we had a very hilarious evening with lots of laughter before getting in our sleeping bags all at around 8:30. In other news, Magic, Puzzles and Spidey caught a ride down to Trail Days in Damascus, a giant festival centered around hikers and the AT. It never really became a possibility that I would go - I'm about to get off anyway in a week and all the advice I've gotten says to go the year AFTER you hike - but it's funny to think that so many hikers are just going to be down there in Damascus. Tomorrow I'll have a shorter day to the famous 501 shelter, where we can order pizza like at Partnership, then it's a longer one down into Port Clinton/Hamburg, where I'll find a place to stay in town I bet.","Clark's Ferry Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/532909,"I knew today was going to be shorter than usual so I allowed myself to sleep in. The sun woke me up and it was turning into a gorgeous day. I started out later than most folks but made good time up and over one hill before descending down into Swatara gap. I took a long break at a few benches someone made in the shade the hulking overpass of interstate 81, which we are passing for the fourth and final time after paralleling its route since southern Virginia. I powered up to the top of the ridge which we will essentially be following for the rest of Pennsylvania. The rocks were bad in a few places, but mostly we were on dirt paths today, especially nearing the end. I stopped and ate lunch at a viewpoint with White Rabbit and then caught up and paced with Frost at William Penn Shelter. I enjoy his company a lot, as well as the rest of his crew (rain man, seal tree and Doc). He would fit in well with my college friends. About a mile out from William Penn, a sobo woman told us that there were snacks and drinks a mile ahead, and we cruised over the flat ground to get there quick! We were met by Slick (Nobo '04) and his wife, who maintain this section of trail and give out lots of magic! They gave us turkey subs, sodas, gatorades, tons of snacks, and, perhaps most welcomely, great comfy folding chairs to sit. We spent probably about 45 minutes there because we only had 2 miles left to the 501 shelter. Doc apparently spent a grand total of about 2 hours with them. I asked Slick if he had any advice for us. He said ""don't have a schedule."" I immediately glared jokingly at White Rabbit, which made her dad laugh. Frost and I walked the last two miles together listening to The Suburbs by Arcade Fire, which I had kind of been going on about all day. Great frickin album. Frost had a banana from trail magic strapped to his chest. Anyway. The 501 shelter is a very large cabin with tons of bunk space and a picnic table inside, as well as a giant skylight that brightens the whole room. I was surprised to find that many of the bunks were already taken by some older folks, a few flip floppers and a couple LASHers (Long-Ass Section Hikers) who did only 4 miles today. We all still got bunks. It was also funny to find myself at the only other shelter from which you can order pizza with the same crew I was at Partnership with. We finally gathered ourselves enough to put an order together. Large Sausage and peppers, yes please. We ate pizza and had a generally uproarious evening as usual, fueled by Seal Tree's skepticism of the restaurant's sauce and the constant mispronunciation of Frost's name. A sobo named gypsy came in late in the evening and Doc very kindly gave up his bunk to her. He's a good guy. Less good was the (maybe thru hiker? I can't tell) guy who had walked down to town earlier in the day and came back in the shelter at 9:30 blasting his music and talking loudly about how great the deals were at the store. Dude. Shush. Tomorrow I'll probably do 24 miles into the town of Port Clinton/Hamburg and find a hotel for the night. Frost and them are doing 15 and 9 the next day and then probably zeroing in the town the day after, but I am basically out of food... Also I am gonna try and push miles such that I can be a little closer to catching up once I get back on the trail. I am probably going to end up staying in town a bunch in the next couple of days. We shall see.","Rausch Gap Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533204,"With the raindrops hitting the tin ceiling of the 501 shelter and the boys settling in for a round of hearts to wait out the storm, it was hard to get motivated to get out this morning. But move on I did, over the rocks and the mud of Pennsylvania through the rain. I passed white rabbit and large and caught up with Odysseus, whom I had met very briefly and had camped a few miles after the shelter last night. We paced each other and chatted for a couple of hours. He's worked for five years in wilderness therapy for at-risk youth and on semester-at-sea programs for high schoolers, and is now setting out one final ""Odyssey"" before settling into a steadier job. He's also from Maine, and thus on a long journey home. I enjoy his name. The rain came down very hard twice, and I got soaking wet. Today wasn't tough terrain, but the rain made it so I really couldn't stop anywhere and squished in my boots. The rain cleared up past about 2, and I ended up taking about two half hour breaks in the last couple of miles. The trail dropped precipitously down into Port Clinton, getting steeper and steeper until it became a rock staircase. It plopped me out in a railyard and I made my way over the Schuykill and into the small town of Port Clinton. I sat on the sidewalk and made some calls about lodging. I wasn't walking any more today, and with the weather looking oft for tomorrow, a break the next day was looking very nice. White Rabbit arrived in a few minutes and I left her to walk a woods road to PA 61, where I was planning to hitch a ride into Hamburg, the much more populated city just south. The road, however, was much larger than I was anticipating: the trail heads under an overpass rather than across the road, and I got very spooked trying to hitch a ride as I stood on the narrow shoulder and cars whizzed by at sixty miles an hour. I didn't like the idea of walking along the road at all, so I took the half mile of trail back into Port Clinton, planning to hitch at the intersection in the town rather than along the road itself. But when I explained the situation, a man putting in a fence just nearby told me that he'd give us all a ride if we waited for him to finish up! What luck! We sat in the sun and waited for Large to arrive, then sat around for some more as Cody - our new driver - packed up. We then loaded our things in the back of the truck and jumped in, heading to the Hamburg Microtel. The other great news was that Large invited me to stay in the hotel room with them (turned out to be perfect, there's a fold out love seat in the ""suite"" that I can crash on! We arrived in the hotel room and showered and began to dry out. Blues is staying just upstairs and visited. Later, I headed down to Pappy T's, a pub attached to the hotel, had a few beers and some very tasty dinner. I met a few other hikers and listened to an 80s cover band that was playing. Their name was Sloth Love Chunk. Huh. I went back upstairs and folded out the love seat and headed to bed.","501 Shelter

Also, I've got four days of hiking to Delaware Water Gap, where I'm planning to get off the trail for about a week to go home for graduation, and don't really need to be home til the 19th or so. I slept just wonderfully last night and woke up at about 8:15 and headed down to breakfast. The Whitesides (Large and White Rabbit's real name) came to visit a little later in the day - White Rabbit's mother and sister were there and after being just amazed by the smell we'd created, they very kindly offered to drive me with them to resupply at Walmart. We then also went to Cabela's, the largest Cabela's in the world with 250000 square feet of retail space, as well as an aquarium, giant mountain display with taxidermied animals and a hall full of replicas of the most famous bagged bucks of all time. I bought some new fuel and headed out with the Whitesides back to hotel. They met up with some more family for lunch, and I facetimed with Ali before heading to Red Robin myself for lunch.

My pack was a decent weight, but I was a bit more conscientious than for my last ""four"" day resupply, so it's not nearly as bad as it was out of Fayetteville. We went down to breakfast and waited around a bit and then Cody brought us back to Port Clinton (after a quick run to Wawa). He truly lives right next to the trail, in a field just where the trail turns to the south towards Hamburg. We thanked him and headed in our way. I walked the half mile to PA 61 for the THIRD time and then began up the steep climb to the top of the ridge. The day was glorious, perfect sun and a stiff breeze. I made it up quick to the ridge and climbed along to Pulpit Rock overlook, where there were many day hikers. The weather decided to start getting very bizarre at this point. I thought multiple times that I was hearing raindrops but didn't feel anything wet, and then I realized it was hailing on me. It hailed for about half an hour on and off, sometimes coming down in ridiculous volleys that just made me laugh with all the white ice pellets jumping around like ping pong balls. I made it to a lovely view called the Pinnacle and stopped for a while with a ton of day hikers around (including one man on a handbike who was clearly paralyzed from the waist down, wow). But the main event of the day was the weather. It was colder than its been in weeks, the wind blowing, and it went from sunny to hailing/snowing/raining about 15 times. I made it to the road leading to Eckville shelter around 2 pm. The shelter is just a converted cabin behind a home owned by the local hiking club and maintained by Mick, the caretaker who lives on site. It was very early for me to stop, but as I sat in the cabin, it began to rain again and I didn't feel like moving. There were showers predicted the rest of the day and I didn't feel like getting more wet than I had to. I stuck around inside. White Rabbit showed up soon, then a flip flopper named Ziptie who is celebrating four weeks from Harper's. It's funny how different paces are. It was frickin freezing out and I put on my other shirt and my down jacket while we sat around. We made dinner and talked, Large showed up as well as some more flip floppers named Olive Oil and Popeye who are very kind. Unfortunately, that filled up the bunks in the cabin, and we started having to turn away hikers who were arriving bedraggled out from the blustering rain. There's a big field next door to camp at, but it sucks to have to turn people away. Among them were Odysseus, who ended up zeroing in Hamburg just like us, and much later, Double Dip and Dirtface. I talked with them all for a while and were surprised when the caretaker and his friend arrived back home from the grocery store, and she (her trail name is Daisy Crockett) came out and offered us the smoothest Irish whisky I've ever tasted. It was great talking to her and the whisky was quite a treat! Tomorrow because I didn't go 7 more miles today, I've got 24 to a shelter just before Palmerton. It looks like it's going to be nice weather, but we will be hitting some of the worst rocks in all of Pennsylvania, including one famously treacherous stretch called the Knife's Edge.","Hamburg, PA via Blue Mountain Rd

White Rabbit and Large were up and at em, and I promised myself I would be quick getting ready this morning. I was, actually, and got out just before them and headed back to the trailhead and began walking. It was gorgeous all day, but the morning was frigid, and I wore my TN/NC border outfit of my wool hat over my baseball cap. A great look. I immediately came up behind two other hikers, who turned out to be Audubon and Quixote! We said hi and chatted about how everything's been going. They apparently came in the shelter last night and were curtly told there was no space. I missed it somehow. It's so awesome to see them again! I pulled ahead going up the ridge and didn't see them again all day. The day was full of rocky sections offset by flat sections, good weather and great views. I actually enjoy scrambling through the huge slabs of rock, it's a fun challenge and reminds of me of Sleeping Giant State Park at home. I'm SO glad that I didn't have to do this in the rain, though. That would be miserable. Beyond miserable, downright dangerous. The most spectacular scramble of the day was Knife's Edge. The scrambling was the most difficult of the day, and was mostly along a fifteen foot drop down to the rocks below. It's just crazy looking over these giant boulder fields searching for a single blaze to tell you where to go. I passed the Bake Oven Knob parking area and a small child out hiking with his grandpa, who commented ""He walks fast!"" as I hiked by. The top of the peak (only a five minute hike from the parking lot and about 150 feet up) was filled with day hikers and teenagers smoking cigarettes, so I didn't hang around. Coming down from the peak was the second most impressive scramble of the day, but most of the rest of the day was smooth sailing over to George W. Outerbridge Shelter. The shelter is pretty dingey, but it'll get the job done. Already here were Nibbles, a flip flopper and Shadow, a LASHer going from Shenandoah to the MA/VT border (he just passed his halfway point today!). I enjoyed Nibbles' sarcasm and Shadow and I chatted a fair deal. Audubon and Quixote showed up a little later, as did white Rabbit, then Large and Blues (whom I'd managed to pass without even seeing him)! We cooked and hang around. Blues retold the story of the Peter's Mountain fire, as well as a few other strange tales from the past few days. It was me, Blues, Shadow, White Rabbit, Large in the shelter, and then Odysseus rolled up at about 8:45! Didn't get to talk with him, but I'm sure I will in the morning. Tomorrow takes us steeply down into Lehigh Gap, where we'll begin the most famously intimidating climb in Pennsylvania, 1000 feet up a steep hillside that's been denuded thanks to zinc pollution. Then it's flat and very very dry for the next bunch of miles. Not sure where I'll end up tomorrow, but I'm looking at two days of hiking and then a pickup in Delaware Water Gap to go home!","Eckville Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535002,"I headed out just behind most folks this morning but caught up and passed some as we rolled down to PA 248 and had our first look at the infamous climb out of Lehigh Gap. The site was polluted for years by a zinc smelting factory nearby, and only with recent efforts has vegetation started to return. But the hillside did look far more green than I anticipated it would, actually. Odysseus was hitching at the road, not sure why. I pulled ahead of white rabbit and large as the climbing began. The climb began with steep wooden staircases and gravel pitches, then turned to boulder hopping and a few rock scrambles. I climbed excitedly, thanking the powers that be that the day was overcast instead of blistering hot. Before I knew it, I was next to the American flag graffiti I've seen so many times near the top. There's a piece of trail back home at Sleeping Giant State Park, where I practiced for this hike, that ascends the side of an old quarry, steep as can be, and tops out at some marvelous cliffs called the Chin. Whenever I climbed up the Chin I had imagined myself climbing the Lehigh Gap. Not gonna lie. The Chin is harder! The trail began its detour around the top of the polluted barren ridge and followed a flat grassy track for many miles with views down into Palmerton and the zinc smelter that was responsible for the environmental issues. But first on my mind was my feet. They were absolutely killing me, like never before on the trip. I was in so much pain from the soreness of all the repeated impacts with the rocks, and God bless these boots, but the soles have worn through and I could feel every bump. I paced with white rabbit and blues down to Little Gap Road, where I gave my feet a massage and popped some Advil for the first time since Hiawassee. I also noticed at he road crossing that the upper of my left boot had begun to detach completely from the sole. Welp. It looks like I'll be using my new boots once I get home. The Advil seemed to help eventually, but hiking was agony for a lot of today. I was pretty certain that I couldn't do more than the 16 miles to Leroy Smith shelter. But then White Rabbit and I pulled in at around 3. Blues was quick to follow and then Audubon and Quixote. In the words of Blues, we wouldn't be ""winning"" if we stayed at this shelter. ""Winning"" for Blues was either going ten more miles - not an option - or going into Wind Gap and getting dinner and beer. I called around some places to see whether we could stay in Wind Gap. I had a surreal conversation with a motel owner who told me he was not open for business but could ""take care of everything I needed,"" and then we began calling businesses. The Beer Stein, that used to host hikers, has stopped, but after nearly giving up, White Rabbit suggested I call Detzi's Tavern. I was immediately greeted by Joe, one of the three Detzi brothers, Joe, John and Jeff, who own the place, and he enthusiastically told me that we should come down and camp in the field behind the restaurant. It was too good to be true, and with my feet feeling better, I saddled up and we all pushed on. White Rabbit, the couple and I stuck with each other down to Wind Gap, and I enjoyed the more leisurely pace. The place they had wanted to camp past the shelter had no camping spot anyway, so we happily pushed down to the road crossing in Wind Gap. At the road crossing was a box of trail magic with snacks and little Debbie brownies and Mac n cheese boxes. I didn't need any more actual food, but I had a couple brownies, then we began walking the mile to Detzi's. Wind Gap may be the friendliest town I've encountered on the whole trail. We had multiple folks stop and say hi and ask how our hike was going, and a few others ask if we needed a spot to camp! We happily refused and moved on Detzi's, which was packed for a Tuesday night. The staff took us immediately though, and put us in a big booth in the corner. I sat at the table while the gang made sure that the camping was alright. It was, a big field out back, but blues, white rabbit, large and I all decided to camp underneath the branches of a giant pine tree, soft ground and my tent out of sight. It was the first time I had brought my tent out since Dismal Falls, before Pearisburg VA. Ridiculous. Dinner was very tasty cheesesteaks and peanut butter pie, as well as a few beers. After setting up camp, I went back in with Blues and Large and chatted with John who was behind the bar. He asked us whether we thought he should advertise camping. With all the recent closures of hostels because of poor treatment from hikers and overcrowding, we counseled him not to. Better to have this be a special occasion for the restaurant and for the hikers than for twenty people to be camped out there every night in June. We told him he should list his phone number, though, and describe his bar in the guidebook as ""hiker-friendly,"" which is sort of a wink-wink way of saying there might be camping. I turned in far later than usual, comfy in my tent, and excited to finish up Pennsylvania tomorrow!","George W. Outerbridge Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535003,"Was tough to leave Detzi's this morning. Joe arrived quite early and as soon as I woke up I went to the back door as John had suggested and Joe, who was blasting classic rock and making soup, showed me where I could find he restroom and filled up my water bottles for me. Seriously, we got treated like honored guests at Detzi's. Huge thanks to them for their incredible hospitality. We separately made our way back up to the trailhead through the overcast morning. My feet were feeling somewhat better, but I popped two Advil just to make sure I wasn't in so much pain. The rocks were pretty ridiculous until the end of the day, just constantly having to stare at my feet, for miles and miles. They ended mostly after a place called Wolf Rocks, the last crazy boulder hop in PA. I stopped for a long time in a field on the ridge where a gas pipeline crosses and someone has set out a number of lawn chairs. White Rabbit and the couple caught up with me and we paced down the whole way to Water Gap, enjoying the great weather and the views of the Delaware River below us. We pulled into town with me blasting Sister Christian by Night Ranger on my phone and rocking out (alone). A block away we found the Church of the Mountain hostel, which is a donation-suggested hostel in the basement of a church with a lovely outdoor table, great hangout area and a number of bunks. We also met Going Postal, one of Blues's hiking buddies from way back! I decided to go in search of food and ended up at the Village Farmer, which reminded me of the roadside stand near my house. I got a Reuben sandwich and a big pastry thing called a Cloud that is like a giant cream puff. I returned to the hostel and took a shower and played the guitar they had hanging up on the wall. Other folks went to the grocery store but I knew that I was getting picked up ten miles into tomorrow, so I was good on supplies. We all went to dinner later for happy hour at the local pub, and I think everyone ordered the rack of ribs special. Delicious. Blues and I went to pick up laundry at the Pocono Inn, where White Rabbit had dropped our clothes off a few hours prior. The place was like somewhere out of a horror film, abandoned and mostly boarded up, yet somehow still functioning. After a surreal few minutes searching for the laundry room, we got out of there and went back to the hostel. Tomorrow I am getting picked up by Lola, who was my nanny when I was younger, who has decided to take the day off of work to come find me in Jersey! It's so nice being closer to home now and I'm lucky to have someone willing to pick me up!","Detzi's Tavern, Wind Gap, PA

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535004,"I woke up earlier than everyone and got packed up. I had ten and a half miles to do before 11 o'clock, when Lola and I agreed to meet at the road crossing for the Mohican Outdoor Center. I said goodbye to folks as I headed out from the hostel. It'll be a long time, if ever, until I catch up to these hikers again. The couple's company and Blues's good humor have made for quite a happy trail experience for the last month. White Rabbit and Large especially have been incredibly kind and good to me, and I'll be sorry to be without them for the next leg of the journey. I wove through the streets of Delaware Water Gap to the on ramp for the I-80 bridge. I believe this was the first time this trip that I crossed a road I have driven on before. I remember driving down the highway across the bridge on the way back from Cleveland, looking excitedly up at Mt. Minsi and thinking I would be up there hiking someday. Here I am. Unfortunately, the bridge is not so nice from the pedestrian point of view. I stopped and took a picture of the NJ/PA border, but the bridge was incredibly unpleasant to walk across, and very long. The road walk along the Delaware was more pleasant, but I was happy when the trail turned back into the woods. Despite Blues's sarcastic predictions that ""New Jersey will be nothing but beautiful wide trail full of dirt and loam,"" New Jersey began every bit as rocky as Pennsylvania. I passed a lovely pond and stopped briefly at a location where Google has a landmark called ""Large Pile of Rocks."" Indeed, there was a large pile of rocks there. I joked to my dad via text that that landmark should cover the entire state of Pennsylvania. Mostly I just hiked quickly, because I was slightly behind schedule for pick up. But 11 o'clock rolled around and I found myself down at Camp Road, and who should I find but Lola, there waiting for me! We immediately threw my smelly clothes in a trash bag where they'll stay until laundry, and I put on cotton for the first time in many weeks. It was surprisingly natural to go speeding through the back roads of New Jersey, I'm not sure why. Normally it feels very strange, but not this time. After a three hour drive, I found myself back at home, excited to see my family, friends, Ali, and to attend Yale graduation in just a few days. I probably won't post again til I'm back on the trail, see you then!","Church of the Mountain Hostel, Delaware Water Gap

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535005,"It has been a pretty great week. I got to see Ali graduate, see many of my friends from college, and got to participate in the many days of Yale graduation, wearing the cap and gown and everything. It's been relaxing and tons of fun. Pulling away this time was much easier than last. I'm not sure quite why. One reason may be that while I had reached a big milestone - Damascus - right before my last break, I am in a strange place where it would not make sense to stop. I've past halfway, and in a way, Katahdin is the next big milestone. Another reason is that in just over a week's time, when I reach eastern New York and Connecticut, my family has offered to pick me and drop me off at the beginning and ends of my days of hiking. It sounds wonderful, and I will be able to see everyone then. My mother drove me back to jersey this morning - thank you so much, momma! - and after the requisite pictures and a hug, I began hiking right where I left off at Camp Road. I started just after noon, and the day was hot. I'm in for some blisteringly hot weather for the next week, it looks like. The trail was also pretty exposed up on the Kittatinny ridge line, and passed many open swathes of rock with hazy views of green forest below. My legs felt good and my feet felt more protected in these new boots. I passed probably a few hundred Southbounders, students from a school in Newark, who apparently have to go on an overnight camping trip to move up a grade level. I drank a lot of water throughout the sunny, hot day. I saw no thru hikers, and when I pulled into Brink Shelter at about 5:30, there were two older gentlemen camping, but no one else. I am guessing I am between some larger bubbles or groups of thru hikers, and our own anxiety about overcrowding in the last couple days of hiking was just a function of us all glomming together, not of it actually being more crowded on the trail yet. I made dinner and caught up on journaling. Three other people are here tonight, just one other in the shelter, which had been recently rebuilt and is pretty gorgeous. I believe two of them are on their final section to complete the whole trail, from Water Gap headed to Falls Village CT. Another is southbound from Massachusetts, attempting a three-part sobo flip flop. A peek in the shelter register shows that I'm two days behind Magic and three behind the Doctor. Unfortunately, being .2 off trail, this register don't get much love. I'll pass who I'll pass I spose.","Woodbridge CT via Camp Road

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535179,"I was up at 6:30, but hanging around old guys will make you feel lazy any day: everybody was gone by the time I started packing up. The day was nice and was clearly going to be another hot one. I started out just before 7:30. I could've slept in later, but I do love me a long break during the day. I passed the two older guys who were Nobo from last night, and made my way down to Culver's Gap. I stopped in at the AT sunrise deli, but found that the place was out of business, or at least not yet open for the year. No snack for me. The trail has been pretty empty since getting back on. I was imagining (as I'm sure everyone does) that there was a huge bubble of hikers right on our tail when I got off, but this seems to have proved untrue. A number of the people whom I was sure would have passed me are still behind - Toast, North Star, Ghost - and I didn't see any Nobo thru hikers yesterday. It made for a lonely kind of day. I miss eating lunch with people and catching up and being caught. Still, the weather was nice and the hiking was pretty easy. New Jersey is very pretty, actually. If I had to describe it right now, I would say, ""Like Pennsylvania, but better in every conceivable way."" I took a break at the pavilion at Sunrise Mountain and stopped for lunch at Mashipacong shelter. I listened to a lot of Lake Street Dive on my way over to High Point Stats Park HQ. At the building I met Tow Truck, as well as Lois and Clark, all of whom I'd met at Eckville Shelter. They've been taking their time, and indeed were only doing 7 miles today. I went in and got the free Pepsi they give away to thru hikers. I don't know if I've ever downed a soda more quickly. It was hot and I was thirsty. The three flip floppers went on a little before me, but I stuck around, poring over the Awol guide to see whether pushing on more miles made sense. It was only 3:15. I decided it wouldn't make a difference to where I stayed eventually, so I decided that 1.7 more was good enough. I paused at the wooden observation deck that only has a view of the obelisk on top of the New Jersey High Point, then descended a half mile to High Point Shelter, where someone has stacked chainsawed rings of log all across the front of the shelter, I guess for warmth? It is pitch black inside. I hung around and did nothing for quite a while, and felt kind of silly for not doing more miles, especially where two Nobos named Justin and Michael came and went a half hour after I got there. Ah well. It's only the second day back out. Let's take it easy. The Berenstain Bears, a brother and sister from outside Boston, rolled up around 5, and we talked and got along well. Tow truck and Lois and Clark had gone done to a lakeside from the High Point and were later in arriving. I was very happy when they all decided to tent, as Tow Truck snores IMPRESIVELY. We turned in around 9 with the sound of mice scurrying everywhere around the shelter. Tomorrow I think I'll head to Vernon where there's a church hostel I'd like to stay in.","Brink Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535970,"It was pretty sweaty in the shelter last night. All this heat does not agree with me. The Bears were up around 6, I waited a little longer in my bag. I was still ahead of all the flip floppers in getting out of camp. Rob and Claire are very kind and softspoken. I hike a little faster than they do, but I am trying to take my time til the Hudson and they are pushing big miles. Today was unbelievably muggy. Temperatures were in the mid 80s, and we were at consistently lower elevations than we had been at in weeks. It was a sweaty sweaty day. The terrain started out easy. In the same way that the Cumberland Valley took us from the very end of the blue ridge mountains (geologically) and up onto the ridge-and-valley formations that span Pennsylvania, today took us off the ridge we'd been following since Port Clinton and back to the ""Appalachians."" The trail wove down through forests reminiscent of the ones I know in Connecticut, across many roads and driveways. After a few bumps, I ran into the Bears and began hiking with Rob. We walked along State Line road in the boiling heat before turning into the Walkill Wildlife Preserve, where the trail traces out three sides of a giant rectangle around a swamp. It was pretty in a way, but mostly the swamp was radiating heat and making us even warmer. I did see a great blue heron and a number of red-wing blackbirds. We and Claire stopped in at an abandoned house that serves as the water source for Pochuck Mountain Shelter, before climbing steeply up to the shelter for lunch. I was able to wring a FOUL amount of sweat out of my shirt, which I left out to dry on the side of the shelter while I ate. I also picked up some extra food that someone had left in the bear box, which meant I didn't need to do any resupply in Vernon! I pulled over some climbs near Pochuck before dropping down to the famous Pochuck Creek Boardwalk, an elevated boardwalk that hangs about four feet above the swamp and extends for a mile over the wetlands. The boardwalk itself is gorgeous, a real piece of trail engineering. Rob caught up with me and we walked over most of it together. He waited on the other side for Claire and I pushed on over one more set of pastures to NJ 94, where I planned to hitch into Vernon. The weather was nice and I was in a great mood as I walked across the street to start hitching. But the first car I saw had an Appalachian trail license plate mooring, so I thought I might be in luck! The car was driven by Graybeard, a former thru hiker and active member of ALDHA, the Appalachian long-distance hikers association. He dropped off one other hiker (who really seemed to have no idea what he was doing) and offered to give me a ride into Vernon! Of course I said yes, and he handed me a Mountain Dew as we drove a little ways into the town of VernonWe pulled up behind the St. Thomas Episcopal Church and headed down to their basement, where they run a hiker hostel! It's a truly great place, tons of space and room to hang out, a kitchen, free ice cream and 50 cent soda, free laundry and shower... Apparently the church is shutting down later this year, and it's a real shame. I also found Rigby, whom I'd met at Rausch Gap Shelter, on a futon watching a movie. She had apparently intended to start hiking this morning after staying last night, then never got up.  We three were the only ones to show up. I showered and threw my clothes in the wash before walking over to he Vernon Inn for a burger and some beer. As I was finishing up my additional plate of wings, however, I checked my email and found a note that Rigby had left in my guest book saying to hurry back to the hostel because we had an offer of a steak dinner!I paid up and briskly walked back over to the hostel, where I was met by Melissa, a trail angel from the town. She drove Rigby and me up in her car to her condo (apparently there's a ski resort here. Ridiculous.) where we met her mother and a few of her brothers. We hung out and talked before they served us a wonderful meal of steak, potatoes and asparagus. It's these kind of experiences that make the trail so strange and special. Melissa, if you find this, thank you so much! Melissa drove us back to the hostel where we immediately passed out. It was a great evening. In other news, one of my pole tips (which I have replaced twice already) decided to start folding in half, not breaking, just folding. I managed to find a piece of a broken MSR groundhog tent stake at the shelter this morning that was exactly the length I needed, and splinted the folding pole using some duct tape. God they need to make better tips.","High Point Shelter

We stopped at Dunkin Donuts for breakfast (which he refused to let me purchase) before heading back to the trail. On the ride, he asked me for three pieces of advice for thru hikers. It took me a while but I came up with: ""Plan ahead, but know that your plans will get ruined sometimes""""Being in a group will motivate you, but don't let it stop you from doing what makes you happy""And ""Hot Springs is the best damn town on the damn trail."" Graybeard dropped me off and I headed on through the hot hot morning. It was already quite muggy, but at least i wasn't going to be walking through a swamp like yesterday. The first climb up Wawayanda mountain, known as the ""stairway to heaven,"" was pretty ridiculous, but then the miles afterwards were absolutely gorgeous, very very nice trail. The trail then began to follow huge open spines of rock, which made for hot, sunny, sweaty hiking. But soon enough, I came to the New York border! I baked in the sun long enough to take pictures, then took a break in the shade and pushed on. The change from New Jersey to New York was drastic. The trail traveled over more spines of rock requiring difficult scrambling, down rock filled gullies and through root-filled first paths. I was egged on, however, by the promise of food: at Route 17A, I took a left and made my short way over to ""hot dogs plus,"" a seasonal hot dog stand where I calculated I ate 2400 calories worth of food in the form of four hot dogs with sauerkraut or chili, two bags of chips and two sodas. Delicious. And as if that weren't enough, I then went over to Belvale Creamery, right next door, which has some of the best ice cream in the state, and got a cone of salted caramel ice cream. It was wonderful. And I only had 2.2 miles left to do, which I left for around 4 o'clock. I made my way over the easy terrain to Wildcat shelter and posted up with my stuff. On my way to get water, who should I run into but a friend from Yale named Nimal, who was in the Whiffenpoofs two years ago, and is now out on a weekend hike with his 11 year old sister. We chatted a little about my upcoming year in the whiffs and what he's been up to (he is a fact checked for the New Yorker, there is hope for English majors like me). Rigby showed up eventually, as did another flip flopper named Neera.

Packed up and was on the trail by 7:45. The trail today was consistently the hardest terrain I've seen since Virginia. Rock scrambles, big climbs, cliffs, ledges, faces of rocks, yeesh. New York is no joke. They make you climb up and down and up and down all day. Highlights included Buchanan mountain and the descent off of Arden Mountain. After crossing over interstate 87 (funny to me because we won't cross 89 til Hanover, I guess the trail heads more reliably north as opposed to east in the next few hundred miles than anywhere else) I found myself in Harriman State Park, with many other Memorial Day weekend hikers. The park is absolutely gorgeous, full of meadowy open Forest that really really appeals to me. I hiked up to the lemon squeezer, a crevice that hikers are forced through in the rock (followed by the only moment so far on trail where I've taken off my pack and poles to heave myself up a rock scramble). I also passed the New York long path, which extends from the GE bridge in Manhattan through the Catskills to Albany. There were a mother and daughter there when I passed. The daughter sounded out ""Ka-tah-din.... 793 miles. Wanna go, mom?"" And I said ""that's where I'm going!"" They asked me a few questions and took my picture. I was making good time so I decided to pass up Fingerboard shelter and go to William Brien. Fingerboard mountain had to be one of my favorite places so far, absolutely gorgeous walking through meadows and rock outcroppings. When I got to William Brien, I was immediately thrown off by a group of people in their early thirties who told me there was a group of 15 camping here tonight, but that became more ok when they said that no one was planning to use the shelter. The rest of them showed up and we chatted and they turned out to be very nice, a bunch of high school friends and their significant others out for the weekend. I especially liked Justin, who works for the AMC in New York and New Jersey. He said he'd put in a good word for me at the huts in the white mountains, which is incredibly kind of him.

The morning was foggy though, as I got up and putzed around trying to make as little noise as possible for the three other section hikers who weren't up by 7:30 as I was. I got a later start today because I had set up a meeting time of 11 o'clock on top of Bear Mtn with Ali and my dad! The trail did not let up on me as I passed my way over to the Hudson: still some serious ups and down, lots of craggy views across back to Harriman State Park and over to the cloudy summit of Bear Mountain. I hurried over the last few miles to the mountain because my father and Ali had been a little faster than planned, and I met them at the first crossing with Perkins drive, which climbs up and around the side of the mountain. I was so happy to see them and they both gave me hugs despite the fact that I was absolutely drenched in sweat. They kindly brought me water and snacks, too, and I unloaded some of my weight into the car so I could fly over the next miles without having to force them to wait for me too much. Bear mountain is an astounding piece of trail engineering, and the staircases going up and down are crazy impressive! I can't even fathom the amount of work it took to make them. I met up with dad and Ali again at the top of the mountain where we climbed the observation tower. Then Ali and I headed off together down the descent to the Hudson! It was the first time she's been on the AT with me! We climbed down the staircases, passing lots of families climbing up from the picnic area, which we descended towards, tortured by the smell of cooking burgers. The sun came out! We pulled through the playground and the picnic areas, which were absolutely packed with families all cooking together and hanging out, celebrating the holiday. My dad had found parking at the Bear Mountain Inn, so we stopped in for lunch there! We all got chicken parm sandwiches. My dad had just met and offered supplies and help to a section hiker who seems to have gotten a bad case of heat exhaustion and could barely walk anymore, and was getting out. Yeesh. Ali and I said goodbye to my dad again while he drove across the river. We made our way through the zoo that the AT peculiarly walks right through before crossing the Hudson. I enjoyed the fact that the Reptile Room closed at 4:20. Right as we started crossing the bridge, dad came up from the other side. It was hot and exposed up on the bridge and we went over pretty quick, but still got the necessary pictures. We made our way over to the car, where I left Ali and dad to go do some more miles.

It was incredibly nice to get to see Ali and my family, and truly was amazing of them to make it happen! My dad and I headed back up the Hudson, pausing at the Stop and Shop for groceries, then at a place called DD's diner for breakfast. Always nice to have a big breakfast to keep yyou going. I got going from the gas station on Rt. 9 again at about 8:45, and let my dad try to get home for his 10 o'clock meeting. Thanks so much dad! This was fun. The day was significantly more pleasant than the last few, with much lower humidity and lower temperatures. The terrain relaxed a little bit as well, and I found myself walking along creeks and on old woods roads just as much as clambering over rocky ridges (which is all New York has been so far). At around 11, I came to a road crossing leading to Clarence Fahnestock state park, and a hiker from across the way yelled out ""Portage!"" at me. It was Frost and Rain Man! Along with them were their fathers, with whom the two have been having a relaxed couple of days ( I believe this was day 3 out from bear mtn). I think the fathers are getting off at the Taconic parkway tomorrow, so hopefully the two youngins can catch up with me! Even in the few minutes I spent with them, I enjoyed their company a great deal. The day had one disappointment when I went about 15 minutes out of my way to use a restroom at the state park headquarters and found the whole place locked up. Ugh. I hate extra hiking. Not hiking.

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536883,"I was slow to wake up this morning, but that might've been a function of the fact that Heath Bar was up an hour earlier than I was. The day was set to be gorgeous, and I got out of camp around 7:30. The trail has certainly changed since the beginning of New York. The climbs are far more reasonable, with fewer abrupt climbs over rock walls, more woods roads, and even a few switchbacks - imagine that - here and there. This morning I crossed over interstate 84, a treat for me since I have actually driven on that road many times, and drove up and down it to go back and forth the last time I went home, and I found myself on the very bridge I had seen from the highway. I took quite a long break at the reentrance to the woods right after the highway. I then made my way up to Morgan Stewart Shelter, where I was met by a number of flip floppers, among them Whiskers and Bubbles, as well as Wings, who attempted a thru hike last year but was forced off the trail just a few miles back by an injury. She's picking up right where she left off. When I told Bubbles I was getting picked up later, she joked ""oh so when are we going to meet the family?"" Hardee har. I passed by the strangely-named Nuclear Lake (actually quite beautiful!) and saw Melted Soul at Telephone Pioneers shelter. He's out for a few days with a buddy and seems to be taking it slower. The biggest surprise of my day came just after the final climb before the road into Pawling. I was coming down the trail when I saw a man with a gray mustache and an AT hat hiking towards me. He looked at me and smiled and paused and I could've sworn I knew him. Then it hit. Just before I came down to Georgia, I went out for my last training hike at Sleepin Giant State Park. At the tower there, I came across the only other hiker I've seen there wearing a pack and using trekking poles. Seeing my pack, he asked me if I was training for something, and I told him that yes, I was planning on starting the AT in just a few days. He told me that he has in fact sectioned the entire trail, and he gave me some advice and pointers, as well as his opinion that if you can hike ten miles over Sleeping giant, you can hike anywhere on the AT (which I've found to be true). He wished me luck and told me his trail name was Willy Walker. And now here he was. I was in utter disbelief. He let me pass and turned around to walk just behind me. Willy has been following this journal since the beginning, and decided to just come meet me out on the trail and hike a little bit and catch up! I couldn't believe his kindness and willingness to come out all this way for me, someone he'd met so briefly. We talked about the trail and about making it to Maine. Willy himself was headed down to Virginia tomorrow to pick up his wife, who has just completed a section from Hot Springs to Damascus. I could not believe it. My former meeting with Willy had been at an amazing transitional moment. I was about to head down to Georgia to start hiking, and frankly, I didn't know what was going to happen. Would I make it as far as my Long trail hike? Would I get injured in the first week and have to come home? Would I just, as many do, give up? Or would I push on m? My world was full of strange possibilites and unknowns. Yet here he was again. And here I was, about forty pounds lighter, with a thicker beard, some swanky new gaiters and two thirds of the trail behind me. I barely even recognized myself in my own memory on top of sleeping giant those months ago. We walked down through a beautiful boardwalk and across New York 22, and through the pastures of Pawling up to Hurds Corner Road, where I had told my father to meet me. Willy would push on and go hike up into the hills a little ways before returning to his car, but I took the time to get some pictures with him and the strange wooden water tower that finds itself next to the road. His visit to me allowed me to take in my hike as it stands in a way I haven't been able to see it this whole time. Willy - or Dave, I spose! - thank you so much for your visit. It means more than you know. I wish you all the best. Just as Willy created the first hill out of sight, the blue Audi was there to pick me up. My father and I drove home through the Connecticut farmland and horse country and he brought me home, where a wonderful summery meal with mom and Lola was waiting. What amazing people live in this world.","RPH Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536884,"I woke up early and headed back home from Ali's, where I'd spent the night, and hopped in the car with my mom, who kindly brought me back to Pawling, where I'd left off. I've been feeling a little off lately. The trail is empty, mostly devoid of thru hikers, and most of the people I know are at least a few days ahead of me. Plus, all these chances to see my family have just made me question what I'm doing out here, or at least made me miss civilization that much more - to get a taste of it and then come back home. All this has contributed to making my motivation to hike pretty low these last couple days. Pretty sure I'm going to take tomorrow off and then make a clean break of it and head back out to the trail on Saturday. But for today, a slack pack. The trail passed through the Pawling Nature Preserve, where I passed wings. She seems like a good soul. I also had noticed at a trail register that both Heath Bar and Magic had just signed in this morning! Soon enough, I found magic hiking along the trail! We caught up; he's just gotten back after a week off with family in New York City - his first time there - and he told me about his time at Trail Days with Spidey and Puzzles. We walked together to Wiley Shelter where he stuck around to filter water. I told him he'd catch up with me at my lunch break. I was raring to go because just a little further on, at Hoyt Road, was a huge landmark for me: the Connecticut Border. I've been seeing the maps along the way and just been astounded at the idea that I've actually walked from Georgia to X Place, but now, I would officially have walked home. I couldn't keep the smile off my face as I passed the green sign and entered my home state. I climbed Ten Mile Hill and took a lunch break at Ten Mile River Shelter, where Magic found me. We walked together most of the rest of the day, perhaps most notably over the 2/3 mark, which found itself on a public gravel road (so I did not stop to make a sign as I had for 1/3). With my lightened pack, I pulled ahead of magic on the last couple climbs before Kent, and dropped down to route 341, where my father was waiting with a cooler full of cokes and beers! We sat on the stile there and talked and waited about ten minutes for Magic for whom my father had gotten the cokes upon request. Dad dubbed him ""a good kid,"" and we all talked before magic moved on and we went home. Tomorrow I will take a zero to do some errands and decompress before heading back out for the final leg of my journey. I don't think I'll be home again after tonight.","Woodbridge CT via Hurds Corner Rd.

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536885,"It's hard leaving home. Yesterday was spent with Ali, which was very nice, but I always want more time. I hope I can find a way to see her again before the trip is over, otherwise this section will be as long and painful as the Atkins-jersey section. My mom and I headed out around 8 and made it to Kent at about 9:30. I barely remembered to hand her back the cooler of trail magic that dad and I had left here two days ago. It seems to have been well-loved. Today fluctuated between crazy steep climbs and descents and extremely flat road walks and river walks along the Housatonic. I felt good though, and decided to upgrade my plan from a 17 mile day to a 25, despite the late start. I also had another motivating factor: Frost and Rain Man had just pulled into Falls Village for two days off with Rain Man's Connecticut cousins, so that was my destination. Felt good all day, and it was pretty nice, still hot and sticky though. I finally made my arrival to Falls Village just before 7 in the evening. I immediately made my way to the Falls Village Inn, which was a far more posh establishment than I was expecting. I asked for a table for ""three sweaty hikers,"" and they offered me inside or on the porch. Enjoying the air conditioning, I asked for inside, and they sat me down near the bar. However, I could see the hostess and another server mumbling something about ""opening a door or a window,"" and then the hostess came back and informed me that I had to move outside. I smiled. Yes. I smell bad. I'm used to it. Other people have noses. So I sat on the porch, feeling out of place in my sweaty wool shirt among very well-dressed old folks. Rain Man and Frost showed up momentarily, and along with them came Gourmet, a flip flopper whom was known simply as James when I had met him at James Fry Shelter. We all had a lovely meal, and I felt less out of place with my friends here with me. After dinner we made our way to the Toymaker's Café, a little breakfast spot and coffeeshop that allows hikers to tent in their yard. I set up my tent in the fading light, then Gourmet and Frost and I stayed up too late watching silly YouTube videos. It was a good first day back.","Woodbridge CT via Kent
","Toymakers Cafe, Falls Village CT","Jun 04, Sat",25.10
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536886,"It seriously rained last night and was still raining this morning when I got up. Frost was in a bad mood because he accidentally left his sleeping pad and bag stuff sacks out in the rain. He has two days off, though, he'll be fine. Breakfast at the cafe was delish! I got corned beef hash, which was homemade, with big chunks of the salty meat.  taking down camp was a process, the first time I've had to take down my tent in the rain, which does not make me happy. Everyone is always impressed or startled when I tell them I've only set up my tent 8 times. It is ridiculous. I said bye to my friends and began a road walk through the town and then back up into the mountains. I barely ate anything out of my pack yesterday and it's still too heavy. The highlight of the morning was Rand's View, an open field up on a hillside with a spectacular view of the taconic range and Connecticut farmland laid out in front of me. It's been the first time I could really see all the peaks in a line and think ""wow. I'll be going over those later today."" I love when that happens. I stopped at got some water from a spigot in a cemetery in Salisbury - a rather funny experience - before heading back up into the mountains again (real mountains!). At a side trail junction, I began retracing my steps from my college pre-orientation trip, which headed from Salisbury up to the Berkshire School past Mt. Everett over a period of four days. When I reached Lion's Head, I remembered sitting there with the group on a gorgeous sunny August day, and beginning to take turns telling our ""Hometowns,"" which were extemporaneous biographies that every member of the group shared over the course of the trip. The view was still nice, but it was far cloudier today, and I could see a storm rolling in. I hurried my way up to Brassie Brook Shelter where I forwent lunch and just ate a couple protein bars, and then kept on racing up Bear Mountain, the highest peak in Connecticut, trying desperately to beat the weather. (This is the first time the trail's been over 2100 feet since Virginia) I climbed preciptously down into Sage's Ravine, a gorgeous valley filled with Hemlock trees and a stream cascading among the cliffs. I passed Chickenfoot (not the same one) and Disco, a couple whose entries I've seen for weeks. And then it began to rain. Pretty bad. I pulled out my coat and immediately rain-robot-hiker mode set in and I just kinda went. Everything began to soak, especially my feet. These new socks hold an astounding amount of water and I wrung them out twice over the rest of the day. I passed into Massachusetts at the end of the ravine and began climbing Mt. Race. I was disappointed that I had to go over Mt. Race in the rain, because it was the highlight of my last trip here: a half mile of gorgeous open ledges with wonderful views to the east of Massachusetts farmland. Now it was a cold gray whiteout, just cliffs fading away beneath me. The rain let up somewhat, but my pace was slow going up and over Mt. Everett, where the trail clambers over many slabs of rock. Fortunately, the shelter was only a mile down from the top of the mountain, and I made good time on the descent. Someone had even left jugs of water so I didn't have to go filter in the rain! I pulled into the Hemlocks Shelter, an impressively large shelter with bunks and a big loft, and also the first shelter I slept in on the AT! I changed clothes and hung stuff up to dry. The rain kept coming down all evening. A flip flopper named No Schedule showed up, as did two section hikers who did not seem to like me. I found a leak in the ceiling that was bringing water all the way into the shelter, and patched it up. Hopefully I'll stay dry. Tomorrow is into down into the valley of the berkshires, then back up and out. Should be a little drier.","Toymakers Cafe, Falls Village CT
",The Hemlocks Shelter,"Jun 05, Sun",20.80
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537026,"Kept raining late into last night, but the little fix I did on the leak seems to have done its job. I woke up nice and dry with the sunlight streaming in through the light fog of the morning. No Schedule was up, and asked me whether I knew anything about transit around Great Barrington. Apparently his knee has gotten to a point where he needs to see a doctor and he wants to head home to Ohio. First person I've seen quit right in front of me. I was the first one out this morning (a product of not having other thru hikers around, I always used to be last) and I passed over the rain-soaked ground and slippery rocks down the miles to Great Barrington. The views were pretty amazing from Jug End and a couple other ledges, down into the Housatonic Valley and across to the mountains of he Berkshires I'll be climbing soon. The terrain was pretty rough, and last night's rain made for a few treacherous descents over slabs and rock jumbles. The trail then let out to a series of pastures, bogs and wonderfully open dark hemlock forest. I like the spookiness of the latter, and the pine needles underfoot feel nice. As I came out to route 7, I decided that it was late enough (11 am) for me to reasonably go in to town for lunch. It only took me about three minutes to catch a ride with a man who had a kayak strapped into the bed of his truck. We passed by the garden center he owns as we drove into the center of town. He suggested I go to GB Eats Diner, and I was not disappointed. I had a burger with a deep-fried patty. Yum. The day was sunny and warm as I headed back out of town. Hitching out of town always seems harder - or at least stranger - to me. When I'm on the trail hitching in, I look like a hiker going into town. When I'm trying to hitch out, I always feel like some drifter, completely out of place among the nice buildings and sidewalks, far from the state routes with the wide shoulders that are good for hitching. I walked with my thumb out for a good ways, and then a woman stopped at an intersection probably half a mile out of town offered to drive me the rest of the way. I thanked her a great deal and she brought me back to the trailhead. Onto Guthook Map #7 of 9, which brings me all the way to Hanover. The second half of my day was filled with rough climbs! Massachusetts is no joke, either. I stopped and got water from one of my favorite sources I've seen so far, a spring-fed brook flowing between a giant cracked boulder. I stopped in at Tom Leonard Shelter and hung out for a good while talking to two girls whom i'd passed earlier. They have just graduated from Harvard, and happen to be the roommates of my family friend who goes there too. When one of them mentioned her name, we got to talking about school and a cappella and name dropped a few other mutual acquaintances. One of them is visiting the other, who is headed (hopefully) from New York to Maine. I wished them luck and moved on. The climbs up to the Mt. Wilcox Shelters were pretty grueling, actually, and I got in just after 6. The late arrival was mostly because of my long lunch in town and and my hour spent at Tom Leonard chatting. The shelter is built just like the Hemlocks, gorgeous and new. I hung everything up to dry. A few minutes after, a man named Chris showed up. He is from Plainville, CT, and is sectioning from the NJ/NY line to Greylock. I told him he picked a hell of a section. He was good company and we talked about gear and life and had a very nice evening. I facetimed Ali before heading to early bed. Tomorrow I'll have a shorter day over to Upper Goose Pond Cabin, one of the highlights of Massachusetts, a big shelter with real mattresses and a caretaker that will make you pancakes in the morning!","The Hemlocks Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537181,"Defying all forecasts, it poured last night. I heard and saw Chris get up in the middle of the night realizing that he had left his shirt and pants out to dry. He was less than pleased about it. Morning broke foggy, but without rain. I moved quickly this morning and was on the trail by 7:25. I wanted to get going and cruise in to Upper Goose Pond Cabin early. Massachusetts is surprisingly wild-looking, with huge hemlock and cedar trees, rocks, roots and mud. It is sort of how I imagined Maine would look on the AT, but better taken care of. The descent off of Mt. Wilcox was very beautiful, a lovely dirt trail cascading through meadows of ferns while the sunlight streamed through the trees, burning off the fog. At the bottom of the descent I met Ibu and Pak, two flip floppers whose entries I've been following for some time. The trail headed through a number of pastures and shaky boardwalks (less confidence-inspiring than the New Jersey ones) and jumped up a little peak called Tyringham Cobble before heading back up into the mountains. I stopped for a while at a lovely spring on the trail with wonderfully fresh, cold water. The trail was mostly flat from there to the cabin, and the recent rain had turned the trail to soup in a number of places. Reminds me of the Long Trail. Vermud is on the horizon. I made it to the turnoff for the half mile trail to the cabin at about 1:15. The place is very impressive, a large bunkhouse with two stories, a big fireplace and kitchen, and a wonderful front porch where I hung out with Bambi and Karen, who are this week's caretakers (they rotate during the summer). I ate lunch on the porch and played with Arya, a beautiful white pit bull pup, and Falcor, an old and giant Irish Wolfhound. The day had turned lovely, and after setting up my bunk, I decided to go for a paddle in one of the canoes that are up for grabs down at the cabin's lakeshore. I actually portaged a canoe today, albeit from the racks to the water, BUT STILL! I paddled around a little island and to the other side of the lake where I went for a swim and cleaned myself off. I dried off on some rocks before paddling back, because it looked like a storm was rolling in. The storm didn't hit all evening. When I got back from the swim, Melted Soul was here, along with a Nobo from Georgia named P-Stout, who began hiking on March 8th. Chris showed up in a bit, too. He's a very charismatic guy, and the caretakers took a shine to him. I napped for a bit after being out in the sun, and then we all made dinner out back at a covered picnic table. I enjoy Melted Soul's company quite a bit. I should get to know him better. Also here tented out are Keebler and Velcro, as well as a mother and daughter whom I didn't get to talk to. This place is an absolute treat, and a wonderful place to spend my afternoon. Tomorrow is into Dalton, where I'll head to the grocery and hopefully find some place to stay... There are no hostels, which is too bad... If anyone knows of someone/somewhere I can stay, I'd love to know!","Mt. Wilcox South Shelter 
",Upper Goose Pond Cabin,"Jun 07, Tue",15.80
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537818,"When I woke up around 6:45, I was surprised to find most people already out of their bunks and downstairs getting ready for breakfast. Apparently P-Stout has to get up at 4:30 for work every morning so that's when he awakes even out here. As promised, Bambi was up making blueberry pancakes, and I packed up as people began to eat. I decided to play ""clean up"" on the pancakes and ate about five when my turn came around. I could've eaten a dozen more, though. I packed up and made ready for a day that looked like it threatened rain all day long. P-Stout, Melted Soul and I all left the cabin together and made our way back to the trail. We paced each other the first rise and down to the Massachusetts turnpike, which is only a half mile or so as the crow flies from the cabin. You truly wouldn't have any idea it was there. I pulled ahead of the two going up the first big climb and passed Ibu and Pak, who had stayed the night at the Berkshire lodge, just next to the Pike. The day was almost entirely flat and muddy, muddy, muddy. Tons of rock hopping and skirting around pits of the stuff. As I reached Washington Mountain Road, it began to drizzle on me, and I threw on my raincoat and made my way a hundred yards east to the home of the Cookie Lady, who usually gives out fresh cookies to thru hikers. With no real indication that it was the place from the outside, I walked up with some trepidation, but once I saw the AT symbol, I felt more comfortable, and set my pack down on the porch out of the light rain. It didn't look like anyone was home, and after signing their register, I made ready to go when I saw the garage door go up. Out of the garage slowly walked an older man who, after I caught his attention, introduced himself as Roy and told me he'd go get me some cookies. He returned a few minutes later with a small wicker basket with chocolate chip cookies! By that time, P-Stout and Soul had rolled up, and they wanted to eat lunch, so I decided to just stick around and eat. Soul and I each also bought a can of coke and two hard boiled eggs from Roy. We had a very nice lunch, and the rain had mostly stopped. The three of us paced each other for almost the entire rest of the day, only splitting at the very last climb before dalton, when Soul took off and I had to get out my raincoat because it had begun to rain again. We all met up again right as the trail hit the train tracks of Dalton, though, and talked through our plan of attack. I had heard that a trail angel named Tom let hikers stay in his yard just a block or two away, and was hoping that would work, but I had also heard that he stopped doing that. P-Stout was more intent on finding a hotel, Soul on stealth camping. We all walked the few minutes to Tom's, and found a tent already in his yard, and him in his front porch, chatting with a young British hiker. The next bit was awkward as we skirted around asking Tom if we could camp at his house. Finally, the Brit mouthed to me that if I wanted to stay here I should just ask, and Tom said it would be no problem at all. Soul and P-Stout decided to just stay as well. Tom is probably the most amazingly dedicated trail angel I've ever met, but he does not tend to express that doing this work makes him happy, though it surely must. He will do anything for you, but never really shows that he's happy to do it. Anyways. We profusely thanked Tom and set up our tents before heading off down the streets of Dalton to Jacob's, a homey restaurant that Tom had suggested. The Brit tagged along for our company. We had a lovely dinner (during which s very inebriated fellow told us to use some of his 40$ in credit on the jukebox) and then dropped by the liquor store before heading back to Tom's, where we sat out drinking beers on the porch. I had been planning to go to WalMart, and Tom said he would drive me after he returned from a shuttle drive from Great Barrington. But as 9:30 rolled around, I figured Tom wouldn't really have time to drive me there. It was ok, I just decided to wait til North Adams, 1.5 days north. Tom came back and had some beers with us. The three folks he picked up came and talked to us, ""informing"" us in that mildly condescending ""I've done trail that you haven't so I'm better"" type of way that it was ""Vermud"" and not ""Vermont."" Thanks. We all went off to bed, I feeling incredibly grateful that everything had worked out better than I ever could have hoped with Tom!","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537819,"Tom offered us all doughnuts, pasties and scrambled eggs in his home this morning. I'd never received such treatment. Seriously, Tom is the most amazing trail angel you'll ever meet, and his own hospitality seems so ingrained in his personality that he doesn't even need to emote his own happiness to do it. I tried to pack up quickly and made it back to the trail, aka Tom's driveway, by about 7:45 after many profuse thanks. It was truly cold out for the first time in weeks. I stopped by the gas station in town to pick up a few snacks. I was going to try and grab meals in Cheshire for lunch and on top of Greylock for dinner, but I wanted to make sure I had something if those didn't work out. As the roadwalk finally turned back into the woods, I noticed a large group of hikers in front of me. The first one I caught up to was Spidey! I haven't seen him since his trip to trail days. He shaved and looks very different now. We caught up and passed NASCAR, whom I hadn't seen since Waynesboro VA. I was moving fast this morning and left them behind and soon passed Magic as well. They had all spent a day and a half in Dalton at the shamrock inn, which Spidey described as only one step up from the Doyle. The nine miles to Cheshire went very quickly and after drinking in the great view of Greylock from Cheshire Cobble, I found myself back on paved streets, hankering lunch. I also passed by P-Stout, who was slack packing south back to Tom's, where he had a steak dinner waiting. Lucky. The one really good looking lunch place didn't open for an hour, and I was wondering what to do when magic caught up. We walked together over to route 8, where I just decided to go to Dunkin donuts about five minutes away, and magic took a trip to a local outfitter to try and replace his pole tips. Outside Dunks I found Chris, aka Becker, who had stayed at the Shamrock with all the folks last night, as well as Gadget, whom I hadn't met but who Magic says I would get along with. I got a sandwich and some donuts and headed out with Chris up the beginning of the Greylock climb. Greylock takes forever to climb, not only because it is high (the first time back above 3000 feet since Virginia) but because it is a long south/north ridge. The climb really took it out of me. But I powered up the last half mile, excited for the views and the promise of a hot meal and a warm bed at Bascom Lodge, where Chris had convinced me to stay the night. The views were pretty incredible. The lighthouse/observation tower on top is closed for renovations, but the views are still just commanding, as the terrain just drops right off of the Summit. I could see back to Bear Mountain in Connecticut, the Catskills in New York, Monadnock in Southern New Hampshire, and from a different viewpoint, the green mountains of Vermont that I will be entering in a few days' time, Glastenbury and Stratton mountains in the distance. The wind was whipping and it was very chilly up there. I entered the Bascom Lodge, which is a large stone hut with a small hotel and restaurant inside. They have a bunkroom that only cost 35 dollars for thru-hikers, and I asked for a night there. Phillip, the man working reception, told me that unfortunately, both 20-person bunkrooms were booked up. I was shocked, honestly, it being a Thursday, and sat in a chair in the lobby/sitting area just poring over the AWOL guide to see what to do. I didn't particularly want to walk 4 more miles to a shelter, or 10 more to north Adams, and I needed at least some food here. I was surprised when Phillip took me aside to talk to me. He told me that he had just talked to the owner, and that he would very happily rent me a bunk bed in a larger private room for the same price as one in the bunkroom! I couldn't believe my luck! Privacy and a bigger room for the same price! I told him that I also had a friend coming up and asked if the same deal might be possible, to which he said of course. Now sure that I was staying the night, I went and had a bowl of soup in the restaurant. A few minutes later, Chris walked in, and asked if he was ""the friend,"" at which I smiled and said yes. He had apparently gotten the same response when he asked about the bunkroom that I did, but then asked if any other thru hikers were around, and Phillip told him I was, and that I was holding a place for a friend. He was overjoyed that everything had worked out despite all seeming to be lost. Phillip showed us into our room, where we put our stuff down and I promptly went for my first showrr since leaving home a week ago. When I got out, I found the whole group of thru hikers sitting around the lounge area; they all decided that 14 miles would not cut it today and were heading for Wilbur Clearing Shelter. Chris, in addition to being a wonderful guy to start with, was in a generous mood, and bought them all a round of beers. Then, who should walk into the lodge but Santi the Brit, hobbling on his poles with one ankle up in the air. Apparently he sprained his ankle quite badly, dropped his pack and hobbled his way a half mile to the first road crossing up Greylock, and hitched his way to the summit. He expectantly asked which of us was willing to go get his pack for him, and the response was unsurprisingly unenthusiastic. He had only started a few days ago, hes 19, and both show; he's not a very conscientious hiker. While most of the hikers scattered so as not to deal with him, and I kind of demurred, believing that he should take responsibility for his own crap, Chris sprang into action. Within a few minutes, he had found an older couple willing to drive back down with him to go to the road crossing, and he and the Brit headed off while I stuck around with the wife of the couple, talking about her job as an archaeologist. The hikers all headed out, and eventually Chris and the Santi the Brit returned. At my suggestion, Santi called Tom, who - AMAZINGLY - offered to come get him from the top of Greylock. Tom was there shortly, accompanied by P-Stout, and still in a jolly mood despite the circumstances. The guy is amazing. We loaded the Brit into the car and sat down after what was a strange few hours for me and a hectic few hours for Chris. We both agreed that the Brit was not exactly the most mature hiker. Soon enough it was dinner time, and Chris and I headed into the restaurant for what we called our little ""Man-Date."" Everything was delicious, and we popped out before dessert to watch the sun go down, only able to brave the 35 degree weather and 30 mph winds for a few minutes. Chris is an exceedingly nice guy, very funny, and very easy to talk to. I hope my family gets to meet him later, as they would hit it off. Chris is from Connecticut, so it could happen. After a debacle involving the ladder I was using to get to the top bunk, it was time to go to bed. It has been an eventful, but truly fun day. Tomorrow into Vermont!","Tom Levardi's, Dalton, MA

We sat in the lee of a stone wall and watched the clouds turn pink and orange. The sun was mostly covered, but it was nice to watch the sky. We headed back inside and I went back to bed for a bit. Since breakfast wasn't available until 8, we had a relaxed morning, capped off with fresh muffins and eggs Benedict for me. Then we saddled up and left. We stuck together over the descent down until the turnoff for Wilbur Clearing Shelter, where I powered up the climb. Chris and I parted ways and said goodbye; he's an extremely kind man and I hope I run into him again. I headed over one more ridge of Greylock and descended steeply down into the town. The day was gorgeous as I came out onto the road in the hamlet of Greylock. I found signs there for a house that lends out bikes to thru hikers to explore the town and run errands. I was planning to just hitch until I saw that the house was a block away and I saw Gadget, Spidey and Magic sitting there. I walked over and found them sitting in the shade of a shed, recovering from eating too much breakfast. I dropped my pack and took a bike and my food bag and rode into town. I felt very virtuous and earth-conscious riding over to the stop n shop. I bought my groceries and rode back to the house, where I met the house's owner and thanked him for the service. I ate the fried chicken I had just bought and headed back out on the trail into town. I crossed over route 2 and the Hoosic River and back up onto the trail, which began climbing consistently up to the Vermont border. I passed Duck and struggled up with my heavy pack through a rock garden to the intersection of the Pine Cobble trail. This was a special moment for me. Exactly one year ago, on June 10th 2015, I began my hike of the Long Trail from the Pine Cobble Trail, and followed it over 270 miles to the Canadian border. For the next hundred miles, the trail is going to be review for me, the same path I walked exactly a year ago! This was quite a coincidence, and it made me very happy to think that I was back here exactly one year ago. I moved on to the border and found the big sign marking the southern terminus of the long trail. I was home, back in my favorite state, and back on the trail I know well. A day hiker came by and was able to take my picture, which made me happy. With my late start and my heavy pack, I was pretty tired, but I knew I wanted to make it to Congdon shelter. I moved tiredly over the miles, but the weather was nice and I was motivated by all the people I was passing: I wanted to get there before them. When I rolled into Congdon Shelter, I found Nascar and Gadget already there, as well as a Long Trail hiker named Pickle. I set up my stuff on an upper bunk and hung out before dinner, setting everything out to dry in the sun. The log book had unfortunately been replaced, so I couldn't see my entry from a year ago, which would've been my first. Spidey and Magic were a while in coming, but showed up and took spots in the shelter. But in addition to us there were probably three hammocks and four tents around, filled with section hikers and flip floppers, among them Popeye and Olive Oyl, whom I met at Eckville Shelter. We had a very nice evening, Gadget and I have a similar sense of humor (which tonight involves poorly singing a lot of Creed songs). Pickle somewhat annoyed me by refusing to hang her backpack on a nail and taking up two mouse hangs for her pack and her shoes, leaving the rest of us to hang out food on one (I made another to ease the load). She then proceeded to hang a bear bag about two feet from the shelter at head height. Ok. I'm back in Vermont!","Bascom Lodge

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538114,"Most folks were out just earlier than me, and planning to go into Bennington, despite being in town just yesterday. I stuck around and gave Pickle advice about different place on the long trail because she asked. Then I moved along. I went along up Harmon Hill, which was as nice as I remembered, a meadowy peak reminiscent of Harriman State Park in New York. Then was the brutal descent into Route 9, which I had built up kind of as a bugaboo in my head. It wasn't as bad as last year. I found Gadget and Magic trying to hitch into town and Nascar and Spidey in the trees waiting to hitch themselves. I moved on up the hill. Just around Melville Nauheim shelter, I checked on the weather and realized it was about to rain for the rest of the day. Which it did. It was not easy going along up to Glastenbury Mountain, but I didn't really stop because of the rain. Today was hard. Goddard Shelter was somehow already packed, with about six section hikers from Springfield Mass. They were already setting up at about 2 pm. They did kindly give me a whoopie pie, though, which brightened my day! I hadn't stopped for lunch, but a protein bar and the pie sufficed. I didn't stop at the fire tower because I knew there wouldn't be a view. The rain slackened off and the 4.3 miles to Kid Gore shelter was actually rather pleasant. I got there and stared at the AWOL guide and decided to just stay, planning to do an easy day and then a nearo into Manchester just like last year. A guy named LewisLark showed up and then moved on and I made a reservation at Green Mountain House in Manchester. I ate quite a bit, having not really stopped to eat all day in the rain. Then P-Stout showed up, after a long day in from Seth Warner, as did Hair Bear, a Nobo I hadn't met before. They both do quite long days. Popeye and Olive Oyl weren't far behind. Tomorrow will be over Stratton!","Congdon Shelter
",Kid Gore Shelter ,"Jun 11, Sat",18.70
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538115,"I felt people moving around at about 5:15 this morning and took a peek out. The fog had cleared from yesterday and the sunrise was spectacular. The shelter has a view facing directly east over a few small mountain ridges, and it was nice to watch the sky turn golden and blue in front of me. Then I went to back to sleep, thank you very much. I was still up way earlier than usual. P-Stout was long gone, and Hair Bear left as I was packing my sleeping bag. As I ate breakfast, though, olive Oyl made the discovery that Hair Bear had left his sleeping pad behind. And given that I walk much faster than them, even though they were on the cusp of leaving, I got the job of running it up the trail. So I tried to hurry out. I was on the trail by 6:40, powering over the pretty easy miles to try and catch Hair Bear. Fortunately, I found him sitting down at Story Spring Shelter, scrambling and rummaging through his things looking for his sleeping pad. He was overjoyed that I had it, and was glad that it had just been at the shelter, not fallen off in some stream. I moved on ahead of him towards the trailhead for Stratton. I felt great climbing up and over Stratton, and did not really stop the whole time. I was hoping for a nice view at the top, but it began to drizzle right as I got to the fire tower, and the wind was whipping and cold. Not wanting to freeze, I just moved on. I decided that I felt good enough and was early enough to just make it to town today. I called up Jeff and he said that was just fine. I moved quickly down to Stratton Pond Shelter, where id called it a day last year, and began the 10.6 miles to VT 11. I paused to make a sign at 1641.8 miles, which is 3/4 of the way up the whole trail!! I listened to music the whole way to keep me going. I nearly caught up with P-Stout on the roadwalk near Prospect Rock, but then I paused to put my pack cover on and he got ahead of me. I also stopped into Spruce Peak Shelter, which might be the nicest shelter on the whole trail, with a sliding door and a wood stove, and space for probably 14 people. I then powered over the last couple miles to the road. I found P-stout trying to hitch in; he'd been there about 15 minutes. I starting hitching with him and we were picked up within 5 and on our way into town. Our ride was a kind New Yorker from around Saratoga headed back home. She dropped us off in the main part of town with a grocery and an outfitter. P-stout headed to a donut shop and said he was going to look for a motel rather than stay at the hostel. I did just a little grocery shopping before heading up the hill to Cilantro Burritos, which did not disappoint. At around 5, I called up Jeff for a pickup to the hostel, and was there around 5:30. I met Magoo, a flip-flopper, Flash, a section hiker and NOWA, a Nobo from springer who began March 14 and managed to pass me. I showered and threw all my stuff in the laundry before descending to eat my take out burrito as well as some of the delicious meatloaf and biscuits that Flash had kindly cooked up! Hair Bear showed up, too, and we all and Jeff had a lovely evening. I went off to watch Game of Thrones, which I was grateful not to have to stream at a shelter, as I have been known to do. Planning a later morning, I went to bed around 11.","Kid Gore Shelter 
","Green Mountain House, Manchester, VT","Jun 12, Sun",25.70
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538116,"I slept incredibly well last night, and was grateful that Magoo and NOWA had not managed to wake me up during their packing. They were leaving an hour before me, at 7 rather than 8. I went downstairs, where I found the remains of breakfast. I was not sure if the leftover pancakes and eggs were for me or Flash, so I cooked up my own pancakes. Mine looked tastier anyways. I enjoyed them with syrup and some cut up apples and bananas that I believe NOWA got yesterday. I packed up all my laundry and my food, and then it was time to go. Jeff and I drove up through the cloudy morning, and as we approached the trailhead, it began to rain. There was no rain predicted and none on the radar: I am betting some strange weather system was just hanging around Bromley mountain and dumping rain. Anyways. I set off at just about 8:20 into the cold and wet. I was not happy, thinking about how I could just be waiting it out at the hostel or something. I stopped into Bromley shelter and sat there for about 45 minutes waiting for it to let up and for me to cheer up. Both did, to a certain extent. The rain became lighter and I texted Ali for a bit, which put me in a better mood. The night before I left for Georgia, Ali gave me a letter that said ""For a day when you really need it."" I came closer to opening it than I have so far yet this trip today. But even just remembering I have that letter makes me feel quite a bit better. I know that she is still thinking of me and loving me even though we're apart right now. I was in a slightly better mood up and over Bromley. No views to be had today. The rain had pretty much stopped by the time I summited Styles Peak. I passed Hair Bear earlier than I thought I would and he explained why; he got turned around at the top of Bromley and followed a ski trail down for a half mile. Yeesh. We both pulled into the Peru Peak shelter and ate lunch there together. I moved on to Baker Peak, where the clouds had finally parted, and the cliffs there made for one of my favorite views I've had all trip! I could see up and down the Valley of Vermont for miles and miles, and I felt as though I was truly in the mountains for the first time since Virginia. It was then a long and muddy descent to Big Branch Shelter, where I stayed last year. I took a decent break there and chose not to push on past Little Rock Pond, in just over three miles. The first mile out of Big Branch is one of the worst-maintained I've seen, full of slick rock jumbles, mud, roots, and with a full-on river running down it at one point. It improved drastically past a forest access road up to Little Rock Pond. I listened to Arcade Fire's album ""Reflektor"" just about all the way through before rolling into the shelter. I was surprised to find the shelter already with a number of people, among them NOWA, Roller (whom I met at Rausch Gap) and a group of five girls just out of high school who are sectioning most of the Long Trail together. Along with them were three girls just out of college and a father with his daughter who cannot be older than 12. It was a lot to come into. But fortunately, many people are tenting, so I've got lots of room next to NOWA down on a lower bunk. Hair Bear never showed up. I hope he's alright. He might've gone on to Greenwall. The girls packed too much food, and Roller and I gladly and greedily took tortillas and chocolate and carrots off of their hands over the course of the evening. One girl had brought a ukelele, and many of them have nice voices, and we sang for a bit. My favorite was when she played Oliver James by Fleet Foxes, one of my favorite bands. Without cell reception, I caught up on my journaling, which had fallen woefully behind. Tomorrow I plan to make it 12 miles to lunch at Qu's Whistlestop, and then a few more to Governor Clement Shelter. It's quite a cold night, but the weather is supposed to change in our favor tomorrow.","Green Mountain House, Manchester, VT
",Little Rock Pond Shelter ,"Jun 13, Mon",19.80
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538364,"There was a fun moment last night when I heard loud noises and a lot of shuffling around. I popped out one of my earplugs and could tell that it was suddenly downpouring. In a sleepy haze I got up and moved my pack and clothes off the lines that hung right along the edge of the shelter. No point chancing them getting soaked by wind-driven rain. The morning was beautiful, though. NOWA and Roller were gone before I really even started moving around, but I managed to move quickly while packing up and was probably on trail by about 7:15. The trail up to the top of White Rocks mountain is in pretty bad shape, but mostly I was glad to be hiking in good weather again. It was spectacular all day long. Despite not having any on-trail views, the miles over White Rocks might be some of the most singularly beautiful miles of the whole trail. After climbing through mud and spiny rocks, I suddenly found myself in a cathedral of spruce, each tree towering up into the air thirty feet before the branches even began. The forest floor is wide open and covered in fallen needles, with jumbles of white boulders dotting the landscape. On its floor, you can see farther through this forest than just about any other. I came to the first of two rock garden where hikers traditionally build little cairns and inukshuks. I made an impressive pile balancing on a downed log, and was quite happy with it. I got about twenty feet on the trail and heard a big clattering of rocks behind me. Oh well. A project for someone else. The rest of the hike over white rocks passed normally. I decided not to go see the view this time, because of how far I remembered it being last time. I managed not to get lost at Bully Brook like last time, because I knew the trail took a funny hop across the river. I had remembered Bear Mountain as being incredibly enjoyable, probably because it's some of the only clear tread on the AT in Vermont. No roots or rocks, really. But having done the AT in Georgia and North Carolina makes me less impressed by good dirt trail. It was fine. Nothing special. I ran into Roller and NOWA at the airport lookout. She had been soaking up the sun for quite a while before I came by. I informed her that the last time I was here, a guy I was hiking with broke his ankle on this descent. I know I was stepping very carefully all the way down to Clarendon Gorge. No ambulance rides for me, thank you very much. I stepped out onto VT 103 in the beautiful bright sun. A number of people were in the parking lot, and I sidled over to see if any of them would give me a ride to the diner a half mile away, but they were all heading out hiking. So I crossed the road and began my walk. I tried hitching for the first four minutes or so, but after that, the restaurant comes into sight, and I would've felt disingenuous to keep hitching. So I just walked. On the porch of Qu's Whistlestop, I found HareBear (I learned how to spell his name) as well as two older hikers, Mad dog and his friend whose name escapes me, who hiked the trail in 06 and are sectioning from Greylock to Killington. HareBear had just eaten and moved on, planning to summit Killington today. We all sat down, and Roller showed up momentarily. We laid out things out to dry in the sun and plugged in our electronics. Vicky, the owner/waitress extraordinaire, came out and began serving us. I asked her if she remembered setting out two bacon cheeseburgers after-hours last year for two hikers rolling in after they closed, and she said she did! I told her it was me and thanked her for her generosity and compliance. This time, I ordered a maple milkshake, pink lemonade, a Cowboy Burger (piled high with onion rings and BBQ sauce) with an extra patty, and a side of fries. Damned if it wasn't the best burger I've had on the trail. Pine Grove Furnace is a close second, but Qu's knows how to cook a burger. I nearly ofered more, but the fullness hit me just before Vicky could ask me what I wanted. I paid my check and saddled back up for the 7 more miles to Governor Clement shelter. No one picked me up on the way back to the trailhead, either. The climb out of 103 takes you up a steep boulderfield between two cliffs, and was a real ass-kicker, but wasn't as bad as the climb just after Clarendon Shelter up Beacon Hill, which was just as steep but on dirt and mud rather than rocks. The rest of the day was spent climbing towards Killington, over road crossings, through fields, and then along and over two Brooks, Gould and Sargent. This area was hit very hard by Hurricane Irene, I believe, and the deluge that followed washed out a great deal of trail that walked alongside the brooks. The trail has thus been rerouted in a few places to jump up a steep hillside only to return to the brook a few hundred yards later. Very tiring. The crossing of Gould Brook was sketchy, but I managed to stay dry, unlike last year. The water is a little lower. About a mile before the shelter, I came across a sign reading ""Katahdin: 500 Miles."" I was pretty excited. It seems like I'm getting into the home stretch. Kinda. There was also a trail register there, and it is the only one I found that extends back more than a year! I flipped to June 16, 2015, and found my signature right alongside Good People's. This was also the first time I signed anything as ""Portage"" rather than ""Ben,"" Good People having suggested that be my name that morning. I finally crossed Sargent Brook right before the shelter, and I didn't want to risk it: I popped my boots off and walked the .1 to Governor Clement in my crocs. I was the first to arrive at around 5, and after setting my things down, I thought I'd go wash up and soak my feet in the Brook. So I headed back down, and when I got there, I decided I might do some good. I waded in in my crocs, then I began shifting big rocks around and gathering others from upstream. I placed four or so stepping stones in the middle of the brook to allow hikers to rock hop the stream. They seemed decently solid to me, and in about 25 minutes, I crossed the Brook in my crocs to test it out. I survived. My feet were getting cold, though, so I went back to the shelter. Roller came up a little after, and said she managed to rock-hop the brook. I was very proud of myself at that moment. Mad dog and his buddy arrived a little later. They rented out, and Roller and I each took half of the shelter, which is dingey and dark, but comfortable. Tomorrow will be over Killington!","Little Rock Pond Shelter 
",Governor Clement Shelter,"Jun 14, Tue",19.70
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538365,"Roller was all packed up as I rolled out of bed. I managed to be pretty quick out of camp again, though. After 90 days, I'm finally getting the hang of it. I said goodbye to Mad Dog and headed on up Killington. The last time I had hiked Killington was in a gray, miserable drizzle. Oh what a change. The hike was gorgeous, and near the intersection with the Shrewsbury Peak trail, Killington came into view through the spruce. I made it the mile and a half over to Cooper Lodge and dropped my pack in order to hike up the .2 to the summit that I skipped last time because it was so ugly out. The trail to the summit was crazy steep, jumping up almost 400 feet in under .2. But the payoff was unreal. I came out to a set of ledges next to a fire tower and cell tower at the top of Killington. The day could not have been any clearer. Perfect blue sky without any clouds, and visibility forever. The entirety of the Green Mountains was spread out before me. The big town of Rutland was away to the west, and Champlain was hidden, but the ADKs were in full view. Looking beyond the fire tower, I could see the ski trails of Stratton and Glastenbury beyond that. Looking north, I saw the long ridge of Monroe skyline terminating with mount Ellen, the sharp top of Camel's Hump, the boxy summit of Mount Mansfield, and beyond even to Haystack mountain in the north. If you craned out over a ledge, you could see mount Washington nearly hidden behind some evergreens. The ridges of the south are fun to climb on, and have great views, but only in the north can you get a peak like this that absolute dominates everything, and allows you to see so clearly where you have been and where you are going. I was astounded by the fact that I could see all but three days' worth of my long trail hike, probably 250 miles of trail in a single panorama. And the feeling of excitement for the whites has been building and bubbling to the surface for every hiker I've met. I continued along the side trail to the Killington gondola to get a better look at the whites. The restaurant at the top wasn't open yet, but considering they sell a PBJ sandwich for $9, I doubt I would've eaten there anyway. I went back over the top and descended back down to my pack. I stopped for delicious spring water at Cooper Lodge and began the long descent to Route 4. I passed a number of day hikers, but nothing else was noticeable about the hike down. It was all very pretty though. They make you climb back up a couple ridges, which is silly. As I dropped onto Route 4, I remembered how my girlfriend Ali had picked me up here last year for a zero day at the Inn at Long Trail. That was a lot of fun. I cracked out the AWOL guide. Decision time. I had been planning to go to Rutland, but just didn't need enough supplies to merit the trip. I decided it would be enough to stop off at Killington on a short side trail in a few miles. So across the road I went. A mile in, I hit a very important place along my hike. After climbing up the side of a hill, I dropped into a clearing full of signposts. This was it: Maine Junction, where the Long Trail and Appalachian Trail finally split after 105 miles. Last year, I took a left and continued North to the Canadian border, but not before going and touching the first blaze along the AT, wondering if I would ever make it back here, hoping that I would. Now here I was. 1700 miles from Springer Mountain, just under 500 to Katahdin, and about to embark on what I have been building up in my mind as the last leg, the final, toughest stretch of the entire trail. I took the requisite pictures, then stood in the middle of the clearing. I paused. Then sighed. Then smiled and began walking, this time headed straight East towards Hanover. Let's go to Maine. It might have been a psychological thing, but I noticed a difference in the trail for the rest of the day. It's less worn, less blazed, more winding. It may be because very few days hikers use this section of the AT. I descended through Gifford Woods State Park and failed to hitch for about 10 minutes along Route 100, and so consigned myself to walking to town. I continued on to Kent Pond, though, where a poorly-marked half mile side trail brought me up to Base Camp Outfitters. I stopped in to see what they had before making my way over to the Killington deli, where I bought some supplies for the next few days. I also ordered a delicious sandwich called the Wobbly Barn, with real, rare pieces of steak, provolone, tomatoes and horseradish. It was so good, I ordered a second one, ate half of it, and wrapped the rest up to go. I walked back to the outfitter, and saw that he sold the brand of insoles I like. I had been meaning to replace mine with a thicker insole: I feel too many of the rocks. So I traded them out and threw my old ones rather unceremoniously in the dumpster out back. Goodbye, old friends. I walked back on the side trail and soon found myself at Mountain Meadows Lodge, which is just a pristine place that I'm guessing holds 20 weddings a summer. I stopped by to get water from their hose, and was nearly convinced to stay by an employee there, who promised a hiker rate room, shower, breakfast and - gasp - beer. I looked at the AWOL guide, though, and there was no good way to get to Hanover in two days if I stayed here. So I thanked her but kindly said no. Nearly killed me. The trail putzed through the woods and dropped down to a beautiful boardwalk before beginning an absolutely relentless climb up Quimby Mountain. This climb gave me more trouble than any in recent memory. Part of the problem was that my insoles are not broken in yet, and with the extra padding, I was losing blood flow to my toes, making my feet very sore and tingly. I stopped halfway up and loosened my boots considerably, which helped quite a bit. Gosh was I tired going over this mountain. My heavy pack, my huge lunch, and the taxing climb up Killington all combined to make me feel exhausted going over the unforgiving ridge line, which includes three more Short and steep climbs. I came back to myself about a mile and a half before the shelter, in time to pay attention to the descent. I am the only one in Stony Brook Shelter tonight, and every sound from the forest is freaking me out. But I'm spread out and happy. Today was a good day.","Governor Clement Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538491,"Sun was shining this morning as I woke up, alone for the first time on any morning on the trail. As I've said, I think I have my morning routine down pat. I hit the trail just past 7, having slept til 6:40 or so. The day was filled with climbing, up and down over the little hills between the green mountain ridge and Hanover. It got pretty exhausting, but I felt good all day long and made good time. The highlight of the morning was 7.3 miles in, where a side trail leads to the Lookout, a cabin perched on top of a hill with astounding views. The cabin has a widow's walk accessed by a long wooden ladder. They were very similar to the views from Killington, with Mansfield in the distance to the north and Washington away in the east. To the south, though, was Killington, its fire tower marking its top. The descent down to route 12 was the chillest part of the day. At the road I turned off and walked .2 up to a place called On the Edge Farm. The place had pies and cheeses and meat, but nothing really /prepared/. I bought a small pie and a few sodas from the québécois lady working the place, then sat outside and ate my tuna and cheese then my pie. It was ok. Another hiker named Booty showed up and got a pie, too. The lady said she would take my empty bottles back, but when I went inside, I called around and couldn't find her. I saw where the empty bottles were behind the counter so I just stepped over and placed them there. As I turned to leave, she walked in and I said I put the bottles in the crate. She told me I wasn't supposed to be behind the counter and then ushered me out and slammed the door closed behind me. Ok. I powered through the climbs for the rest of the day, enjoying the views from the tops and the glorious sunshine. There were many walks through fields of long grass. I was the first into the shelter at about 4:30, and was soon joined by a young québécois couple, and a number of Boy Scouts and their leaders, who are camped up on the hill. Nimbus and Brookie, two section hikers just older than me, are in the shelter tonight too.","Stony Brook Shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542679,"****(Welcome to the first entry of my journal after my long hiatus! I summitted Katahdin on July 14th, after a wonderful journey through New Hampshire and Maine, and am now happily back home. Right in Eastern Vermont, my phone's screen protector suffered an impact that made hitting ""l,"" ""p,"" ""o,"" and ""backspace"" nearly impossible, which made journaling incredibly frustrating. So I stopped. I kept notes for every day, and now, back at my computer, I plan to flesh them all out into full entries over the next week or so.)****I woke up earlier than everybody else this morning - tends to happen when you're the only thru-hiker - and tried to pack up quietly. The boy scouts were up and making a ruckus soon enough. I availed myself of the privy, which is usually not worth a mention, but the privy at Thistle Hill - called the Cloudland Privy - is a tall hexagonal tower with wraparound screened-in windows. Very swish. I moved quickly over the bumps of Vermont down towards West Hartford. The trail in Eastern Vermont has been unlike any other on the AT, and very beautiful. The trail cuts through wide open pine forest, when there is as much as thirty feet between trees. The trail disappears, and you are left picking your way from blaze to blaze over a soft bed of red pine needles below your feet. I descended a final hill and hit the road leading into West Hartford, Vermont. Walking down towards the White River, I noticed the cars flying by up on the opposite hillside on Interstate 89. I have traveled that road countless times on my way to Stowe, Vermont, and even recognized the white-and-green Hartford public library, which I have seen from the highway but never been up close to. I walked across the bridge over the White River, and was looking down into the lovely water when I heard a bell ringing. I looked over to see one of the scout leaders from last night ringing a bell on the front porch of a house across the road, and I was reminded of Jeff Taussig telling me that there is a family in West Hartford that ""won't let a single hiker pass without feeding them something.""I hurried over to find Dill sitting on the porch along with the scout leader, who identified himself as ""Merlotrin PM."" I was quickly met by Mrs. Hart, who lives there. She immediately handed me a plate of scrambled eggs with cheese and ham, a cup of piping hot coffee, and a toasted muffin. I couldn't believe it. I spoke with her adorable four-year-old grandson and enjoyed the morning with Dill, whom I hadn't seen since Harper's! I suggested that I wanted to go jump off the bridge into the river (a hiker tradition), and Mrs. Hart generously gave me a towel to dry off with. The water was fantastic, and I jumped twice off the bridge. I love jumping off things into water. Sebastien and Genevieve, the Quebecois couple, showed up momentarily and were treated to eggs just the same. As we sipped sodas from a cooler, Dill and I looked at each other with the ""I could stay here all day"" look in our eyes. But finally we managed to pull ourselves away. We thanked the Harts profusely and wished them the best, then headed off up the road. Only a block or two later, we were stopped by a woman in a minivan, who identified herself as Bobby and gave us each a snickers bar! She is one of Sooner or Later's neighbors, and asked me if I knew where he was at. Unfortunately I didn't, ever since he got off-trail at the Cookie Lady's house. We moved on through quiet Vermont streets and under the highway, then back into the woods for the ten miles between West Hartford and Norwich. I stopped to fill up water and lost Dill for the duration of the section, catching her just as we stepped out onto Elm street, which leads down into Norwich. Bobby had called this street ""Trail Magic Alley,"" and when we found a cooler filled with fresh watermelon slices and homemade banana bread, we were not disappointed. We continued down into town and stopped in at a little grocery store in Norwich to grab a drink before beginning the long roadwalk across the river into Hanover. The day was hot and gorgeous, and we walked excitedly towards our second-to-last state. The Connecticut River was filled with boats and paddlers, and we stopped in disbelief and elation at the river pylon where a big sign proclaims the border between Vermont and New Hampshire! Wahoo!We pushed up the hill into the town of Hanover. It was reunion weekend, and the city was mobbed, but we weaved our way through the seas of green shirts and onto main street. I had thought that I would push on past hanover today, but the extended stay in West Hartford made me want to go no further. Dill and I laid our packs down and headed into Lou's, where we had heard tell of free muffins for hikers. We were offered doughnuts instead - even better! Then we headed to Ramunto's, where we had heard of free pizza. We were given a free cheese slice, and each decided to get our own full pizza and a beer. That's how they getcha, I spose. Entice you with a slice and you'll stay for dinner. A couple days ago, my dad offered to come visit me when I got to Hanover, and we agreed on a meeting time that morning. And so a few minutes into my pizza, my dad strolled into Ramunto's! It was so good to see him. He and Dill had in fact already met in Virginia, and bonded over being Canadian and stuff.  The plan for the evening was to head back to my family's place in Stowe, Vermont, clean up and have some dinner. I had offered earlier in the day for Dill to come along, and she had demurred, but I offered again and she accepted our offer of a stay for the night! So we all piled in the car and drove to Vermont. Dad and Dill talked a lot about Ontario and where Dill is from and where she studies. Once home, I hopped in the shower before realizing that we hadnt turned the hot water on. Dill, being the polite Canadian she is, made do with a cold shower rather than ask if there was hot water. We threw in some laundry and we all went out for a meal at the Whip, enjoying the evening air and Heady Topper, one of my favorite beers. Then we all headed back and turned in for the evening. Tomorrow, we're on for a day of slackpacking out from Hanover!","Thistle Hill shelter

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542682,"We slept in a little bit this morning, enjoying the rarity of an actual bed. Then it was downstairs to a breakfast of donuts and other snacks that we had hastily bought at the gas station after dinner last night. By 7:45, we were piled in the car and back on the road to Hanover. We stopped by the local outfitter in town, where Dill's mother had sent a package for her containing, it seemed, a few new clothes and some snacks. Unfortunately, the sending of the package was a bit late, and it hadn't yet arrived when we checked in. So we moved along, saying bye to my dad for the day, and continued the roadwalk through town. We passed by athletic fields and grocery stores before turning through a parking lot and then back up into the woods overlooking Hanover. Right before velvet rocks, we met another hiker, Cosmo, who began in Daleville, and who has been hanging out with White Rabbit and Large! I was catching up to them! The day's hiking was pretty uneventful, a lot of small ups and downs before a moderate climb up Moose Mountain. We have passed into the realm of the Dartmouth Outing Club, most notable for their bright orange signs, that look as though they were made by children, and have doodles and surprisingly unhelpful maps. The last challenge of the day was a climb up Holt's Ledge, which Dill describes as ""That scary-looking triangle"" on the elevation profile. The climb wasn't as bad as we were expecting, though, and the view from the top was pretty spectacular, a gorgeous view into the smaller peaks of the whites, including Smarts mountain to the north, tomorrow's big climb. Unfortunately, a lot of the ledges were fenced off to protect peregrine falcon nesting. It would've been nice to sit along those cliffs. We headed down the mountain and met my dad at the Lyme-Dorchester Road. He happily got some work done at the Hanover Public Library during the day. We stopped in at a small store in the town of Lyme for some snacks before heading back to Hanover. We decided to go check at the outfitter for Dill's package, which still had not arrived, and while we were in town, thought we might as well stop in at Ramunto's again to see if any hikers had arrived. There was a line of packs outside the restaurant, and inside we found DoubleDip and Dirtface, Bolt, Postal, and RaSa! Dirtface screamed and gave me a big hug. I had managed to pass them while they took the day off in rutland, and was disappointed that I would not probably see them again, so I was happy to get to run into them. I ordered a beer and talked for a while. They were all doing well, and had taken a very short day into town, and were planning to go see a movie before hiking out a mile from town for the night. Eventually we had to say goodbye, though, and we got back into the car and headed to Stowe. We went to the grocery store for some resupplying, and Dad picked up some steaks for the evening. He cooked us up a big meal when we got home, telling us that it gave him immense joy to see us ""consume so much red meat."" We then turned in for the night. Great first day in New Hampshire.","Stowe, VT via Hanover, NH
","Stowe, VT via Lyme-Dorchester Rd.","Jun 18, Sat",17.50
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547458,"After breakfast this morning, we piled back into the car to make our way back to Hanover. We didn't need to get back particularly early, as we know we were going to stop in Hanover at Zimmerman's to see if Dill's package had arrived yet, and the store did not open until 10. But when we arrived at Zimmerman's, we were once again disappointed to find that they did not have Dill's package. It's kind of a crappy store. It seems to specialize in selling Dartmouth kids North Face gear rather than actually having any services or items that thru hikers want. Dill had been thinking that she would forego her package, but she opted to stay in Hanover. And so we parted ways, she to a trail angel's home for the day, and I back in the car heading up to Lyme. Watching dad pull away from the trailhead was among my most emotional moments of the whole trip. It was so nice to see him, to be in civilization. And here I was setting out for the final leg of this journey, the last leg without contact from my family. It's hard to get up and go each day. And now I was alone again, alone facing the challenge. I wiped the wetness from my eyes and headed into the fields and up towards the foothills of New Hampshire.Immediately, I passed a vibrant little sign marking the way to the home of Bill Ackerly, perhaps the most famous trail angle of the whole AT, who offered ice cream, croquet games and love to every thru hiker who passed. Bill passed away only weeks ago, and a sheet of paper with his obituary had been hung up next to the sign. I moved on (only later to find out that his family is currently inhabiting the house and giving away ice cream!).The first few miles were easy, like the beginning of yesterday, and I quickly came to the crossing of Lyme-Dorchester Rd, where the trailhead for the climb up Smarts Mountain begins. An older hiker who identified himself as Slipknot was there, and we chatted a little as I filled up water. He seemed like a bit of an oddball - he pushed off full steam ahead up the wrong trail until I yelled for him to come back, that he wasn't on the AT. I passed him just a little ways up, as the climb up Smarts Mountain really began. Smarts mountain was the toughest climb I've had in quite a while. The trail took me over boulders with rebar inserted and large open faces of rock. It climbs up an arm of Smarts called Lambert Ridge with wonderful views up to the summit and to the southeast, a lot of open rocks. Unfortunately, at the top of the mountain, the fire tower was under construction by a trail crew, and I could not go up to get any views. I stopped in at the Fire Waden's Cabin, then continued on my way. The descent to Jacobs Brook was very easy, and by the time I got down to the water, it was time for lunch. I was met there by Atlas, whom I had heard about only in that he had been hiking with White Rabbit and Large for quite a while along with Cosmo. WE ate lunch together by the water. I have gotten in the habit of taking my shoes and socks off at lunch, and today as I was packing up to go, a deerfly bit me right on my pinky toe. And something about the placement of the bite made it the single itchiest experience of my life. I have never before had an itch so powerful that I truly could not concentrate on anything else, but today was that day. I took off my boot twice while climbing Mount Cube in order to scratch it. The hike up Mount Cube was exhausting, and it was blisteringly hot under the sun on the exposed ledges of the mountain's ridge. I passed up on the side trail to the north peak and began descending again off the mountain. I tanked up water at a small stream, as I knew that there would be none at the campsite where I wss staying. Past Cape Moonshine rd., i came upon a number of bear buckets hanging from a tree, labelled ""Trail Magic for NOWA!"" I knew NOWA, and also knew that it was far too much for one person to carry, but the contraption hanging the buckets was too complex for me to want to figure out. (Cosmo and Atlas later informed me that there was water in one of the buckets, so my carrying three liters was pointless. I arrived at the Ore Hill Campsite after a surprisingly grueling short climb up from the road. There used to be a shelter here, which makes sense, because the tenting spots are very minimal. I set myself up in a little clearing a few feet from the firepit. Funnily enough, there is still a privy from when this was a shelter, and what a privy it is. Huge and well ventilated and with an actual carved throne on the seat. I sat around for a couple hours, Atlas and Cosmo rolled up eventually, and we chatted over dinner. They're both good guys. And amazingly, despite having very little service all day long, I was able to get enough data to stream game of thrones! Lucky me. Gnight!","Stowe, VT via Lyme-Dorchester Rd.
",Ore Hill Campsite,"Jun 19, Sun",18.30
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551484,"Cosmo was up and at em when I rolled out of my tent this morning, but Atlas was a little slower. It's funny how few times I've set up my tent over this entire trip. I made a trip to the crazy nice privy at this campsite, then packed up and headed out. It was about a ten mile section from the campsite to where the big climb of the day, Moosilauke began. I think that in my head I forget about these sections that are not particularly challenging and think they will just pass like a breeze. But this one took a serious while, over some smaller peaks. But something amazing did happen on the way! As I was passing along a ridge, I thought I heard a crunching noise to my left. I turned around, and there was a moose about fifty yards off the trail. It was quite small, probably adolescent, and without antlers. I think this is karma paying me back for being literally the only thru hiker I know who has not seen a wild bear. I crossed NH Route 25, and decided not to head to the hiker hostel that is nearby, thinking that I didn't really need anything. Just past the road was Oliverian Brook, which is just slightly too deep to want to try and rock hop, so I popped off my boots, taking a break on the other side. I climbed back into the woods for a spell, stopping at Jeffers Brook Shelter, where I met a couple of southbound section hikers! They let me pore over their southbound copy of the AWOL guide, which fascinated me, being a mirror image. I also found a log book doodle which I really enjoyed which says ""The Trail Really Does Provide."" It really does. The trail moved back out onto roads, and I climbed up the pavement to the Glencliff trail head which would take me up Moosilauke! I believe this is the third single largest climb for northbounders, only behind Franconia Ridge and Katahdin. And it quickly became one of my favorites. The trail begin nice and wide but changed back to a hike similar to Killington. I was sweaty all over, but the weather was absolutely divine. I stopped by a wonderful spring halfway up and cooled off in the crystal water. Right after the toughest section of climbing, the trail spit me out onto the Carriage Road, which is a surprisingly wide trail leading up to the summit, probably about six or eight feet of well trod path. The trees were short and I could see over them to the mountains beyond, and up to Moosilauke. I couldn't believe my luck with the weather. About a week ago Audubon had sent me a picture of himself and Quixote up at the top in blustery rain. No thank you.The trees fell away completely and gave way to the bouldery, gravelly trail I have seen before in the whites. Soon enough i came out onto the top. Wow. It was spectacular up here. I took an incredibly long lunch break, knowing that I would not get something as special as this often. I talked with some local high school kids and a father and son who came up later. A group of counselors in training from a Christian girl's summer camp nearby gave me a bagel with cream cheese! Yum!The view was outrageously good, back to Killington and away into the next days of hiking: the Kinsman Ridge, the Franconia Ridge, the Twins and Washington itself. Eventually I had had my fill and made my way down and across the flat open summit. This is probably my favorite summit so far on the trail. The trail ducked back into the trees and was surprisingly tough, having me jump over boulders and even do some uphill climbing, but eventually i came to the turnoff for Beaver Brook Shelter. Here begins one of the craziest descents for any northbound hiker, dropping 2000 feet in just less than two miles. The descent is accomplished mainly by wooden steps that have been punched into the granite faces with iron rebar. They are not very confidence-inspiring, especially when you see that a number of them are missing, broken. The brook itself ran right next to the trail, and made for some incredibly impressive cascades. I stopped by a waterfall at one point, amazed at how long the descent was taking, and what a toll it had on my knees. Eventually it flattened out, though, and I neared the trailhead at Kinsman Notch.Right as I pulled into the parking lot, i realized this was going to be a difficult hitch. No cars were going by on the road. But wouldn't you know it, an old couple pulled up from the trail right in front of me, and I asked them whether they were headed into North Woodstock, which they were. I thanked them profusely, but they seemed to think it was what anyone would do, the decent thing. They drove me the three miles towards town, and dropped me at a beautiful white farmhouse, the Notch Hostel. i placed my stuff out on the porch, and headed inside to see what I could do, but nobody was really around. I noticed that check in was from 4 onwards, and it was about 3:20. I waited on the porch. At about 3:50, a truck pulled up with a young woman named serena, who owns the place, and out of the passenger seat popped BLUES BROTHER! I hadn't seen the man since Pennsylvania, since his plan to do insane miles had popped into his head, in order to finish the trail before his family's July 4th gathering in Florida. He explained that he had been getting tired of doing miles, but his father said to him that he would just buy him a plane ticket there and back out of gorham nh if it meant that much to him. Which meant that Blue had about two weeks to kill and only about a week of hiking. So he had been taking it very slow, and indeed stopped for about four days doing work for stay at the Hostel in glencliff. He has been taking side trails, and now was doing work-for stay at this hostel. Serena checked me in to the hostel. She is incredibly sweet, and she and her husband just opened the hostel last year after a successful set of thru-hikes. They are some of the youngest hostel owners around, and seem to be very much loving it. The place itself is beautiful, an actual house; i spose if you also cater to skiers in the winter, you have a higher standard than the usual hiker hostel.I got cleaned up and set up and decided to bike into the little town of North Woodstock for some food. It's amazing the different muscle groups that get used in exercise. I was exhausted. i picked up a sandwich, a pie, and some beer and headed back. I spent the evening playing the 12-string guitar that the hostel had hanging up on the wall. Great day.","Ore Hill Campsite

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551486,"I woke up decently early at the hostel, and was feeling good: today was another day of slackpacking, this one from Kinsman notch all the way to interstate 93 at franconia notch, where I would then find my way back to the hostel. i made myself some pancakes in the kitchen before picking out the little gear that I wanted to come with me for the day. I was the only hiker shuttling out this morning, and serena brought me right back to where I'd left at the parking lot yesterday.The norm has really become serious climbing now in New Hampshire; whereas before, the steep sections were tempered with moderate ones, there just seems to be never ending sections of tough climbing. This morning was no exception, up and over Wolf Mtn. and onto the Kinsmans. I stopped in at Eliza Brook Shelter, which is brand spanking new, and in an incredibly picturesque little valley, before bracing for the assault on south kinsman mountain. The trail followed the brook for a good while, then broke away and crossed a bog with a great view of some granite cliffs above. The climbing was reasonable, and then unreasonable. Their were multiple walls of rock to be clambered up that made me thankful I did not have my pack on. I had one scary moment of nearly falling backwards. But mostly, the views were just incredible, back to moosilauke and to the surrounding Whites, which are just breathtaking. I passed Teresa, a german woman staying at the Notch but slacking the opposite way.At the top of south kinsman mountain, the close-up view of Franconia Ridge is just spectacular, a perfect set of peaks a rockslides and cliffs. I continued on to North Kinsman, and took a break on a buggy ledge there. I descended off the peak and then ambled my way through different trails (none of which are named the AT, but all of which have scrawled on the sign ""AT THIS WAY"") to Lonesome Lake Hut, the first of the White Mountain Huts that I will reach. I went inside, and recalled the sort of stainless steel fixtures that I remember from Lakes of the Clouds. This one is much smaller, though, and the main room is octagonal. I ate some of the baked goods that they had for sale; unfortunately, they did not have any leftovers on offer, as they sometimes do. I saw a guitar hanging up on the wall and took it down and played for a while. In the meantime, Booty arrived, whom I hadn't seen in about a week. He has been planning some crazy mile days, trying to Get to Katahdin very very early, and wanted to head up most of the climb up Franconia Ridge tonight. Power to ya, Booty. I headed out just after him. The descent down to the Notch was aboslutely lovely, one of the few forgiving sections in the whites. I did see one strange sight: about a mile from the Hut, two men in speedos, carrying their clothes and shoes in their arms, asked me, in thick German accents ""How fah to ze lake?"" I guess it is Hike Naked day (which I did not participate in, given that I am on one of the most populated parts of the trail)I came out into Franconia Notch, and relished passing the FINAL INTERSTATE OF THE ENTIRE TRIP! As I came to the side of a brook, I turned down a side trail: unfortunately, there is no state route for a little while, and you cannot hitch on the highway. So I did about a .7 mile roadwalk down to the parking lot of the Flume Visitors Center. i stood at the entrance. No cars. As usual here in new hampshire. Then I saw a car pulling out of the lot, with a license plate that said ""3HIKERS."" I put out my thumb, thinking my chances were pretty good. I was right. The man who picked me up brought me to Wayne's, the store where I'd bought food last night. i bought some more food and did a little resupply. Considering I believe I have meals coming my way in the form of leftovers and bowls of soup at huts, I did not pick up much. As I walked out of Wayne's, a man pumping his gas asked me if I was headed back to the Notch Hostel, and when I said I was, offered me a ride there! He has done extensive trail work, and indeed said he replaced the steps heading down the beaver brook trail off of Moosilauke. When I pulled up to the hostel, I was surprised to see Booty there! He had blown out a shoe and decided that hiking up Franconia Ridge would be inadvisable. Also there were two southbounders, Dr. John and Story, the first thru hiking southbounders I've seen. Tomorrow looks very ugly in the weather forecast. I'm considering taking a zero day here. I haven't taken one in a long long time, and there's no reason to be hiking up on the franconia ridge, the jewel of the AT, in the rain. All of us piled into a truck and Serena drove us to the Common Man restaurant for some food and drinks later on. It's fun palling around with all these hikers. Fun night.","The Notch Hostel via Kinsman Notch

Not hiking today.i slept in for a while in my bunk, which is part of a large, open attic room in the hostel. There are many private rooms downstairs, but this place is great, as far as hostels go. Would come back here anytime, even for skiing. I headed downstairs, and Serena told us that she would be leading a group for work-for-stay gardening in about fifteen minutes. But when we got to the porch to do some word, the rain had worsened, and Serena said ""screw it,"" no work to be done. I don't believe anybody got out hiking today. Around lunchtime, Serena drove a number of us into the much larger center of Lincoln New Hampshire. We did a little bit of shopping at the grocery store, then headed for burgers. I tried to explain to Booty that ""Poutine"" is not pronounce ""pooteeny,"" to no avail. They also had a hard-to-find beer I very much like called Kentucky Breakfast Stout at this restaurant, so I had two. Serena picked us up, and was driving us back when I realized I forgot my tuna (basically the only thing I'd picke up at the store) at the restaurant. So we drove back. Then back to the hostel. I had heard news that a bunch of people I knew were headed to the hostel tonight, so I was extremely excited! Blues had gotten all the ingredients for chicken jambalaya, and cooked us all up a wonderful meal. Later on in the evening, people began to show up: Roller, Rob and Claire, the Berenstain Bears, NOWA, White Rabbit, and, giving me a big old bear hug, Large! It was incredibly good to see them! Large and White Rabbit had taken a day off at the Glencliff hostel, and were sure that they would see me at least pop in! I was sorry to have missed them, but glad to see them now!

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551489,"I woke up early this morning, raring to go, excited for one of the hardest and most beautiful climbs of the whole trail. Unfortunately, there was a problem: NO PANCAKE MIX LEFT!!! Whatever. I ate some of the extra food out of my own bag. I would probably get more food than I thought from the huts. Yesterday, Blues went to the doctor see if a rash that he has is Lyme Disease. It was. He's now on doxycyclene, and won't be headed out with us today. I also forgot to mention that Cosmo is here too. Atlas, though, is somewhere behind us. There was a big crowd attempting to get back to Franconia Notch this morning: the early crew, including Booty and NOWA, headed out, and then the second run piled in. We didn't have quite enough space, and because we were headed up the interstate, we couldn't get in the bed of the truck. So I sat on Cosmo's lap in the front seat while six people piled into the back meant to hold five. It all went fine though, though we could not stand the sensor that told us to put our seat belts on. Back at the trailhead, Serena said goodbye to us. She gave me a big hug and thanked me for all the music I played, and told me to come back soon! We all made our way along the approach trail back towards the AT. The climb was not as crazy as I was expecting, but just ratcheted up and up. I passed Booty near the entrance to the trail, but he passed me as we got to the steep part, flying past me, muttering something about how Red Bull gave him wings. We topped out at the Liberty Springs campsite, where I caught up with NOWA and filled up water from a beautiful spring, deep in a rock. i informed a couple friends of ours as they passed that this is the last water on trail for 8 miles. I tend to pay attention to the guidebook better than just about anyone. After one last push, the trail turned left and flattened out (apparently, Cosmo turned right and ended up summiting Mt. Liberty). Booty and I paced each other through the thinning forest, and up onto the beginning of the treeless ridge.This is the most spectacular section of the AT. There is simply no denying it. We had an absolutely perfect day for it, too. The views were incredible, and every single moment made me want to stop and take a picture. Each of the peaks was more amazing than the last. Everything, from the feel of the place, the rocks, the mountains, was perfect. I enjoyed the rock scrambles around Haystack Mtn. Booty an i stuck together over basically the whole ridge. On top of Mt. Lincoln, we got questioned about our hike from a family. It seems the whites has the highest concentration of people who are genuinely curious about the AT, and also the highest concentration of people who think they know a ton about the AT, and... really don't. We met up with Trippin' Billy, another thru hiker I think I'd see once before, and hiked to the top of Lafayette, tallest mountain in NH outside the Presidential range. We stopped to eat lunch and soak in the view, which is everything an AT view should be, up on the treeless summit. All the folks from this morning caught up and began to eat lunch, too. I laughed at Booty's choice of foodtsuffs: first, a ziploc bag full of cooked salmon - he likes the salmon but cant abide carrying cans with him; second, snyder's pretzel bits, covered in gobs of mayonnaise. He's a funny one. He doesn't hike with poles, wears an american flag bandana, short-shorts and Ray-bans, has a huge red beard and ponytail, and crazy eyes. I like him. Booty and I headed off before the others down the side of Lafayette. The trail is marked by cairns, some of which are very hard to follow. Only a few weeks ago, two thru hikers had been up here in the sleet, and nearly died when they got lost off the trail, and were only saved when they were found by another thru hiker, who quickly set up a tented and boiled them water, keeping them alive long enough for Search and rescue folks to arrive. Apparently yesterday there was another ice storm up here. Thank God i did not go hiking in it. We reached the col between Lafayette and Garfield and then headed up the steep climb to the summit. The top of Garfield used to have an observation tower, and now just has a square foundation, which Booty and I hunkered down in to avoid the wind, which was blustering. The view, despite being surrounded by two higher ridges, is commanding, down two incredibly long valleys. We hung out here quite a while. The descent down Garfield was fine, but after the turnoff for Garfield Shelter , where most of the group had been planning to spend the night, became an incredibly steep river. I thought of Large, who absolutely hates this kind of stuff. In fact, the miles to Galehad Hut were surprisingly brutal, always headed up little rises and down drops of ten feet or so, and very tiring for a portion we thought would be chill. Finally came the turnoff for Galehead Hut, which finds itself in a little col next to Galehead mountain, with a lovely view of the same valley to the south. Booty and I left our packs on the porch and headed inside. The place looks recently redone, with a lovely bright wooden interior. We sheepishly asked if they had any food theyd be willing to give us. They immediately heated up a gigantic tin of pulled pork for us, and willingly gave it: anything they don't give away they have to pack out as trash, so they were just as thankful as we were. i also asked about work for stay. I had heard that the optimal time to get there was about 4 oclock, and I was there on the nose. The woman - part of the Croo, which is what they call themselves - who runs work for stay was happy to give me a spot. Booty and I hung around for a while gorging ourselves on food. But Booty wasn't gonna do WFS, he decided to go find a stealth spot somewhere. NOWA showed up just as Booty was rolling out, and snagged a second work for stay spot, and helped himself to some pork. I saw that right behind the counter (where they sell tshirts and such. humm), they had a guitar. i asked if I could borrow it, and they readily assented. As I tried to tune the thing, I realized it was missing pieces of the tuning pegs. I eventually got a pair of pliers and got the thing into some kind of tune, after a very very long time. I played through much of the afternoon as the day hikers, guests in the hut, piled in from days spent around the whites. During dinner, they asked NOWA and me to stay out of the way, truly it's quite a lavish affair for the guests, with big pitchers of water and juice and many many courses of food. I sat and played guitar and felt a little out of place. During this time, another thru hiker named Wonka showed up! I had heard quite a bit about her, including that she's a senior at Junior at Duke doing essentially what I am doing but a year earlier. I thought she was ahead of me, but had taken a few weeks off for an injury and has now caught up. She is incredibly driven and an intense hiker. She also tends to be by herself, she apparently has not hiked with the same person for more than three days. She took the final work for stay spot. While the Croo put together a funny sketch basically trying to get the guests to tip them, we were given free reign of the leftovers, which included veggie enchiladas, pasta, mashed potatoes, pulled pork and blueberry cake. This made me feel a lot better. After dinner, Wonka and I sat outside and chatted, while I played guitar. I played her the only Avett Brothers song i know, because they're her favorite band. NOWA, wonka and I talked with the woman in charge of WFS. Two of us could do night chores, and one morning chores. Though I had gotten there first, and would've preferred night chores, I knew that the other two were very early risers, and would want to leave. So I elected for the morning for their sakes. They did a great deal of dishes (and I did some), then we hung around while the guests played games and talked. Everyone went to bed around 10, and we set up our gear on the floor of the Hut for the morning.","The Notch Hostel via Franconia Notch

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551490,"I was awoken by the hutmaster telling me they were going to start breakfast setup, and i needed to move my stuff. I slept well, and clearly longer than nowa or wonka, because of my earplugs. Wonka had already gone, and NOWA left pretty quickly, foregoing breakfast. Me, I sat around. I played more guitar out on the porch while I waited for the guests to finish up breakfast. When they had finished, I grabbed food, and was quickly joined by a cohort from Garfield Shelter, Roller, Rob and White Rabbit. As I finished, I asked what my WFS would entail, and quickly learned that WFS is a funny thing in the whites. I was going to remake all 43 beds in the place and sweep out each of the bunkrooms. It was a lot of work, and involved a lot of standing on the death-defying ladders up to the four-high top bunks of the rooms. While my friends moved along, I was stuck sweeping until 9:45. Blugh.i was incredibly antsy and a little bit frustrated, and I used that to power up the near-vertical climb of South Twin. I passed both Large and Roller on the way up, and they both told me I looked like a man on a mission. The exertion helped me cool down emotionally, and I took a short break at the top for a picture with the presidential range behind me. I passed and chatted with trippin' bily as we summited the Guyot Spur, and he explained how the last time he was here he headed a mile out along the ridge before realizing he'd lost the AT. the trail does go to some amazing mountains, including Bondcliff, maybe the most picturesque summit in the whites. For next time. At the behest of a few section hikers, i took a short side trail to the wooded and boring summit of Zealand mountain, because it's very hard to get to except on multi-day trips, in case I ever want all the 4000 footers in the whites. Further down the Zeacliff trail, I found Dill, sporting some new clothes from her package in Hanover. She had not taken a day off since, but had ended up hitching into Lincoln with Wonka (on the highway I might add) on the day of that terrible rainstorm. We paused at Zeacliff, a wonderful lookout ledge with wonderful views across to Mt. Willey and the presidentials. From there I could see the strangely flat and open section of trail we'd be walking later in the day, as it skirts around the Willey range.From there, the trail dropped steadily down to Zealand Falls Hut. Again I have to laugh at the sort of terrain which is readily becoming normal but would be simply unheard of down South on the trail. At the Hut, I found Cosmo, Roller, White Rabbit and the bears waiting and eating lunch. Having heard about two dollar bottomless soup at the huts, i went inside, and indeed found that to be the case! I ate about four bowls of soup, and was very happy. We ate out by a roaring stream that flows right next to the shelter.Also, wanting to continue my streak, I asked if the hut had a guitar, and Indeed they did, but it was missing a string. And so i continued my streak of also fixing up a guitar that had something wrong with it. I played for a while and let the others go ahead of me, a soaked my feet for a time in the river. After a short descent, the trail flattens from the Hut to Ethan pond, in one of the most reasonable sections of the whole trail in new hampshire. There were still boulders, but the walking was not tiring, and I pushed at a good pace to catch up to everybody, which I did at the turn off for Ethan Pond campsite. I took a break with Cosmo, Rob and Claire at the turnoff.White Rabbit reluctantly decided to stay here and wait for Large, reluctantly especially because of a hiker named honey badger whom she was sure was headed here and would insist on playing his plastic trumpet again, which had kept everyone up at Garfield last night. Rob and I paced each other down to Crawford Notch, on one of the most gentle pieces of trail I've seen in a long time. We pulled into the trailhead parking lot and made our way across the road, which I had driven about four years ago when I led a group of twelve-year-olds on a multi-day excursion to the whites. This is the last road I would cross where I had driven previously. We made our way down to the Saco river with the intention of stealth camping. A big sign there said ""NO CAMPING."" But we also found dill there, in a prime tent spot. We didn't want to move on, and people had clearly tented here time and time again. I went searching for some more spots downriver, which there were, but inferior to the ones right next to the trail. Honestly, we figured, the sign is more geared for locals who would throw parties and camp out and leave trash. We promised to pick up after ourselves and say a few Hail Marys. Claire soon showed up, as did NOWA and Cosmo, who set up downriver. We set up three tents in a surprisingly efficient manner and cooked dinner. It was a very nice night, and full of togetherness and camaraderie. We are getting so lucky with the weather, and New Hampshire is spectacular.","Galehead Hut
","Saco River, Crawford Notch","Jun 24, Fri",14.80
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551538,"We woke up this morning incredibly excited for the day to come; We were headed up towards the highest mountains we would climb for the rest of the trip: the Presidentials. What was more, the day was gorgeous. I can't believe how lucky I'm getting with the weather here. If I can get through New Hampshire without hiking in a day of rain, the month of Northern Virginia and PA rain will have been worth it. The climb up to Mt. Webster was tough, very tough, and hard on my thighs. Recently, I haven't been getting tired out on the climbs anymore, but this one took it out of me. But man was it worth it. As we climbed thousands of feet out of Crawford Notch, the trail began to take us out on a series of open granite ledges with incredible views back towards Franconia Ridge. It was fun to look forward and back up and down the mountain to see the ledges where we had just stood and were about to head. It was less fun to see NOWA about a hundred feet above us and say, ""holy crap we have to climb that."" Rob and I paced each other through the morning, waiting up a few times for Claire, Dill, and White Rabbit, who must've absolutely run down the hill from Ethan Pons, but had now caught up. We paused atop Mt. Webster for a while and I made friends with a fearless Gray Jay, then moved along towards mount Jackson. This piece of trail I had actually already completed four years ago with kids in tow. The weather was much better today, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. We enjoyed the view of The Presidentials from Jackson then headed down to Mizpah Spring Hut for lunch. Soup, again, and as usual, although this hut offered refills for a dollar rather than for free as at Zealand. But still, it's probably cheaper (and lighter) than anything I could have bought and carried up, so a good deal over all. I continued my streak of playing guitars at huts, this one being the nicest so far. Lunch was pretty relaxed, as I hung around for another pot of corn chowder to be put on the stove, and Large ended up showing up. Also three thru hikers showed up, talking about their intentions to get to Lakes tonight, having started I believe at Zealand this morning. They had long shaggy hair, and seemed to have a ""crush miles, take no prisoners"" attitude to hiking. Not my style, but hike your own hike. One's name was Blazer, I remember. After they left, Large turned to me and said ""those are the type of hikers who'd sleep in a ditch."" Hardcore, just not my style. I got going a little before Large did, headed up towards Mt. Pierce and the confluence of the Crawford Path, one of the oldest and most famous hiking trails in the nation. I had been debating with myself all morning (and indeed, all trip). The AT skirts around four major summits of the ""Prezzies,"" Monroe, Eisenhower, Adams, Jefferson, and leaves the summits accessible via loop trails. Ostensibly, this is so that some zealous thru hiker does not attempt to go over all of them in a damn snowstorm, and is the smart thing to do so that people are not stuck unable to ""finish the trail"" even in bad weather. However, I wanted to go over all the summits. I felt that that is what the Appalachian Trail at its heart is about, and what it is for. But part of me wanted to complete what is actually ""The AT."" But as I got over the little rise of Mt. Pierce, I saw the summits laid out in a line before me, spilling down, Eisenhower's scrubby summit, Monroe, gray, tilting wildly, the sharp top of Jefferson, Adams like a distant pyramid, and Washington lording over them all, and I knew that I had to go over all their tops. That is what I needed to do, not even as a hiker, but as a person. I hiked with renewed vigor, and plowed over all of the summits, leaving behind Dill at the Eisenhower loop trail. There were many other hikers around, doing the Crawford Path and the loop trails. I took a break at the top of Eisenhower, which had a lovely view back all the way to Moosilauke. My favorite other hiker was a man who was carrying his schnauzer in his pack near the summit of Mt. Franklin, one of the littler peaks. I also passed Cosmo here. The loop trail over Mt. Monroe was ever cooler, taking me up two subsidiary peaks. it was composed only of a jumble of stones, though, and was tough going sometimes, not something that should be attempted by someone with bad footing. Or in the rain. duh. I sat for a while on the summit of Mount Monroe, admiring Mt. Washington, now only a mile away, and marvelling at the fact that I was finally here, finally doing it. I couldn't believe how lucky I was. I spoke a little bit with some French hikers who had me take a picture for them. Mainly, I had some time to kill. It was only about 2:30, and I knew I wanted to do a work for stay at LOC, but I was worried that I would be too early and would be turned away. So I sat around. One guy walked past me with bare feet. Which is pretty crazy. Finally, just after 3, I decided to head down the half mile to LOC and try my luck. Lakes of the Clouds Hut is the largest in the Whites, and can sleep over a hundred guests, I believe. It sits right at treeline, with a great view up to Monroe and Washington both, right next to two alpine ponds (that I eschewed to go swimming in). The At walks right past the front door, and I dropped my pack outside and came in. i was anxious, hoping to spend the night here. Then I saw Cosmo and White Rabbit and Rob, who quickly gave me a thumbs up. I spoke to one of the Croo members about WFS, and she pointed me to another guy who asked if I was part of the group of 8 who wanted to do WFS, pointing to Rob. I said yes! Good goin Rob! He set up WFS for like twice as many people as usually get it, and all even before i got here. Roller, Cosmo, Trippin Billy, White Rabbit, Large, Dill, the Bears and I would all be staying the night! woohoo! There was a lot of time left in the day, and they put us to work immediately. But let's just say they went a little easier than Galehead. Kia, the hutmaster, first gave me the job of reorganizing their game bin. This was not very hard, but was surprisingly gross because there was some standing water in the plastic tub... I then was asked to reorganize the bookshelves, which entailed standing on a chair and making sure each of the log books from the past four decades (wow) were all in order, and then grouping the other books into naturalism, sci-fi, children's books, etc. It was pretty easy. We also did some sweeping of the main dining area before dinner, then Kia brought us outside. During the evenings, the huts have a form of entertainment for the guests in the form of talks, about composting, about geology, etc. Kia asked whether two hikers would be willing to give a talk about their experience on the trail and answer questions. I would've loved to do this, but Large and Claire were chosen, and I can see how they would give interesting and complementary perspectives, a young woman just out of college and a 50-year old man who's wanted to do this all his life. I was going on dishes duty. In the meantime, I also checked out the Dungeon, a little concrete room under the Hut that acts as a year-round emergency shelter, but is available to thru-hikers for I believe 10 dollars during the summer. Blazer and his buddies were there. It was pretty dingy, but only slightly more so than the average shelter. I also asked about the guitar that was behind the counter, but i was informed that one of the Croo members actually had a much nicer one that he was willing to lend out to folks who could play decently and would be careful. It was honestly a great guitar, and I sat outside the Hut playing tunes. Cosmo has a very nice voice, too, and joined in on a few songs. Another Sobo section hiker rolled up named Mica, who had brought his own guitar, and we played some songs together, as well as taking some very classy pictures in the dying light of the day. Kia gave a short talk about the routine of being a Croo member; twice a week they all head down the mountain with packboards on their back, carrying down trash and bringing back up fresh food. All the non perishables, though, as well as the gas on which the entire place runs, is brought up via helicopter at the beginning of the season. Apparently their is a bit of contention in the huts of whether everyone should carry the same amount of weight or whether stronger, heavier Croo members should carry more. I asked If we could see and try out the packboards, to compare them with our modern day packs, which kia kindly agreed to. She brought out a packboard and I gave it a try, first carrying Kia and then Rob. It's surprisignly easy to use, but cannot be comfortable to carry multiple miles uphill, yeesh. I had my first interaction with Honey Badger, who came up later in the evening and got another work-for-stay spot. He is a thru-hiker from last year doing a section from Connecticut this year. And indeed he has a blue plastic trumpet. Which doesn't sound as good as he thinks it does. He trumpeted over a few of Cosmo's and my duets, to my chagrin. Also at the Hut was a man with long blond dreadlocks named Wanderlost, who is hiking south, and was a friend of Honey Badger's last year. He seems like a bit of a space cadet. As the guests all ate dinner inside, we sat out in the back and joked, having a great time. After they were done, we ate some dinner, which was Thanksgiving themed, and included some delicious mint chocolate cake for dessert. There was not quite enough food to go around, though, and the Croo ended up heating up a pot of soup for us all, which was nice of them. Rob and I got placed on dishes duty, and we learned their cleaning system and did a hell of a job, I must say. Wanderlost, who was placed on our team, too, was nowhere to be found during the process. The Croo did nicely tell us to take a small break and go look at the sunset, which was spectacular and orange and pink. The guests were up for a very long time talking and playing games, much longer than at Galehead, and all the thru hikers were sleepily laying out their gear among the tables trying not to get in the way but also to motivate them to quiet down. This has been a wonderfully eventful day. Tomorrow will be over Washington!!","Saco River, Crawford Notch
",Lakes of the Clouds Hut,"Jun 25, Sat",11
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551540,"I was again one of the sleepier thru-hikers, but got some nice rest on the floor of the dining room. My stay at Lakes overall has been wonderful. Cosmo this morning took down one of the log books from the 70s and found where his father had signed in when he thru-hiked way back then. It must've been such a different sport, none of this lightweight stuff, and fewer of these towns. Anyways.Most of the thru-hikers were sticking around for breakfast, and some of them had morning chores, and wouldn't be out for quite a while. Their aim tonight was the Osgood Tentsite, a few miles short of Pinkham notch, the first road out of the Presidential traverse. I told them my plan was to head all the way to Pinkham in order to get to a hostel in Gorham tonight. Large honestly seemed kind of hurt, and said something to the effect of ""So you want to leave us behind?"" It wasn't like that, but I was sad rather than frustrated. I really like this group. But I'm trying to go at my own pace and hike the way that I want to. And frankly, I'm trying to finish the trail pretty quick to get back home to Ali and my family. It is sad that I would leave these folks so soon, but I have to go and hike my hike. So at about 6:40, I packed up my things and made my way through the ruckus of morning hikers outside the Hut. I said some goodbyes and gave Large a hug, then powered off into the beautiful morning. The sun was in my eyes as I made my way up the final mile and change to the summit of Washington. The contours flatten into a sort of tableland here, and it is so so barren, unlike anywhere else, really. I passed a big sign declaring that this area has ""The Worst Weather in America."" I kept turning around to see LOC fade away into the distance. And just like that, I was at the summit, the highest spot in the northeast. It was perfectly calm, not even a breeze, and no one was out. the visitors center was closed, and the auto road would not open for quite some time. The only other time I'd been here it had been packed with people, and I had been frustrated with a particular tourist in flip-flops who was taking their picture at the summit sign. Today, there was no one. I wandered over to the summit sign and took a selfie before finding a drinking fountain outside the visitors center to fill up my water, the last before Madison Spring, six miles ahead. I felt very much at peace with the world climbing down the side of Washington, looking into the Great Gulf wilderness to my right. Four mountains were splayed out ahead of me, and I would summit each of them. I crossed over the cog railway and enjoyed the meadowy and verdant alpine growth. The cliffs to my right began to just drop away down into the dense valley. I then left the AT to follow the ridge up over Mt. Clay, which would allow me to keep seeing both valleys to my right and left. In doing this, I also left the final piece of the AT which I had formerly done. The rest will be new! Clay was very beautiful, and I relished being up so high on the ridge rather than down below on the bad weather route. I rejoined the AT only to leave it again very soon to go climb Jefferson, which flattens out near the top and whose summit looks like an oversized cairn. This was kind of a disappointing summit; I was expecting something cooler.i took a break below at Edmands col and talked to some more French-speaking folks. The view back to Washington was great, and I could see the smoke rising from the cog railway's first trip. The trail then began to bump up and over some smaller peaks as it skirts Mt. Adams. At a place called thunderstorm junction, I turned off the AT for the last time to go hike Adams via Lowe's path. This one was really fun, and I enjoyed jumping between all the boulders. There is not really a trail on these side loops so much as a suggested route to the top, with intermittent blazes and cairns. To make a trail would require the breaking of hundred s of huge boulders. I really enjoy this type of hiking, but I know lots of people who would not. I passed a group of folks my age; one of the girls told me I was doing a great job of picking a route and followed on my tail up to the top of the mountain. I chatted with her; she was wearing a UVM sweatshirt and was a law student there. I told her I loved Burlington. The summit was surprisingly infested with bugs, and I did not hang around for too too long. But it was beautiful, and contests with Monroe for my favorite of the loop trails. The Air Line trail, which I followed down, was incredibly sketchy, and I moved faster than I probably should have. It involved a lot of jumping down from rock to rock, placing single hands on boulders. It became a little more reasonable rejoining the AT. The Hut came into view for a while and looked very picturesque next to the triangular bulk of Mt. Madison, the last of the Presidentials.I stuck around Madison longer than I really wanted to, waiting for another container of soup to be heated up. But I was hungry and really didn't have much food left. I also ate a piece of pumpkin pie. NOWA, who had gotten out from LOC just after me came by and we chatted over lunch, but he left before I did. i finally broke my streak of playing guitar at Huts, because the Croo were not sure where the guitar was. i powered up the last climb of the day up Madison, which is Bar none my favorite of the Presidentials. The summit is spectacular and very pointy, and has a great view of the rest of the range, and then off towards the Carters and Moriah range that I will be hiking tomorrow. i took my picture and got one last high-elevation view of Washington and began the climb down.The AT follows a spur of Mount Madison down to Pinkham Notch known as the Osgood Ridge. It drops about 3000 feet in 2.5 miles. It is just steep steep steep. The whole way. I noticed a change in the way sobos looked before climbing up this ridge and after; this is I think the single biggest climb a sobo does (not counting katahdin.) The trail bumped down along little flat areas of the ridge and then dropped in a consistent manner. Views were great the whole time, but eventually it was time to head back into the trees, which I hadn't really seen since Mizpah Spring Hut yesterday. The descent through the trees was even hairier than in the rocks, and didn't slack off til I made it to the Osgood cutoff, where the rest of the gang had been planning to stop this evening. I met a sobo from Katahdin named Sarge who was beefy and enthusiastic. The trail was now in the Great Gulf Wilderness, which has very little signage and no blazes. I was glad to have guthook to help me along, as there was one tricky turn that I know people have gotten turned around on in the past. All in all, though, it was a beautiful section, with a great suspension bridge over a stream. I unfortunately think I embarrassed an older woman who was having trouble crossing a stream by just leaping across it in front of her husband. :/The trail did a few more climbs before following an old stage road down to Pinkham notch, very easy walking. I came out to the parking lot and enjoyed seeing signs for Tuckerman Ravine. It was funny to feel so fully in touristy civilization again after one of the most rugged days of my trip. Sitting out front of the visitors center was a man singing very loudly and violently playing his guitar, but he was singing one of my favorite songs from Neutral Milk Hotel, so I sang along. I called up the White Mountains Hostel, where I am staying tonight and asked for a ride (which is free if you stay two nights with a slackpack in the middle). I then went inside and got a Coke, and laid out in the sun of the lot waiting for my pickup.The man who picked me up told me we had another passenger, named Mexican Buddha. I figured it was probably the hiker who was playing guitar, so I went and got him off the porch and we headed to Gorham, the last trailtown in New Hampshire!The hostel is an old colonial style home, and has some strict but pretty good rules about cleanliness: before I could even step in the house, I was told to strip and change into clean clothes; they do your laundry for you! I hung my pack and shoes up and headed inside. I was given a very nice bunk and spent the afternoon playing guitar with Buddha and talking to ""the French flying pigs,"" a mother and her three children who are out doing sections of the trail in NH and Maine. The kids are probably 12, 9 and 6 respectively, and I was amazed to see them out doing this. Also here was Tootsie, a section hiker who is calling it quits, but knew Buddha from last year. Buddha is finishing up a hike he began last year; he started in new york and will head to katahdin, then back to harper's ferrry where he began last year. I also got wind that Booty was staying the night here! He is now a full day ahead of me, having just completed the huge day of slackpacking I will do tomorrow. After I showered, we hung around outside on the lovely porch and talked and played music. Booty plays guitar too, and Marni, the owner, came out to listen to us. Marni drove me and a couple hikers to Walmart for resupply. i need to start carrying a full pack again now that every shelter doesn't have soup and leftovers. Imagine my surprise as I walk into Wal-mart and see sitting at the checkout line, Lightning, Seal Tree and Goldie!!! I couldn't believe it! I hadn't seen Seal Tree since the 501 shelter, Lightning since the James River Bridge!!! Goldie I had never met before, but had seen her in pictures with Doc Trails. She and Lightning have been hiking together since Harper's Ferry, and Seal Tree joined I believe in New York. She is a thru hiker, but did the southern portion last summer, and started back in Harper's (she started late enough though, that she's finishing in one year.) She is about to start college at Bates.I didn't have too much time to talk with them, but apparently they've been taking it pretty easy, having a great time since I last saw them. They are now one day ahead of me, and are staying at another hostel in town, and heading into Maine tomorrow. They were caught up on top of Washington on that rainy day and ended up getting picked up by Goldie's parents on the auto road, and taking some time off. I need to catch up with them.I finished up my groceries and headed back to the hostel where I ate some food, facetimed with ali and watched the season finale of game of thrones (eventually, after futzing with the wifi network for the longest time). Tomorrow is going to be one of the craziest days on the trail for me: Even though I won't have a pack, I will be trying to go 21 miles over pretty objectively the hardest terrain in new hampshire. It took Booty 10 hours, and I'm expecting just about that. We shall see.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551544,"Blerf. I am dead. Today was the toughest day of hiking I've had. I woke up around 6:30 to get ready for the 8 am shuttle. Breakfast, which was included in the stay, was some very tasty french toast casserole and eggs. I got my stuff together for another day of slack packing (damn i am doing this White Mountains thing right). Buddha did the same, but just brought his water bottle and a few snacks, while I just emptied my pack out, as I had in VA. I want George to see the whole trail too. Marni drove us back to the Pinkham Notch visitors center, and we crossed the street. Buddha pulled ahead of me through the first flat sections of trail. Then the trail began to climb. And climb. and climb and climb. Right up granite walls. Christ. Some of the ledges were beautiful, and I passed Buddha on the way up, but goddamn, we climbed 2000 feet in 1.6 miles. We topped out on the first peak of Wildcat mountain, where there is a ski lift climbing up. i searched around for a water spigot, being almost out, but couldn't find one. Buddha soon came up and couldn't find one either. We stopped by a pretty disappointing observation tower before continuing on our way, pacing each other. The trail continued more woodsy, but still pretty steep, to the top of Wildcat A, where there was a nice cliff with a view down to Carter Notch and Carter Pond, and the Hut way down below. It looked impossibly steep, right below us, splayed out.The trail switchbacked steeply but reasonably down to the notch, passing one particularly hairy rock slide that freaked me out a little, but soon Buddha and I made it to the cutoff for Carter Notch hut, which was .2 off trail. But in the hopes of free food and certainty of water, we went. Buddha had me take some pictures of him taking a dip in the pond. I did not jump in. The Croo at Carter Notch was mostly out on their trip for supplies, but the two young guys who were working there were very very nice to us. It's the smallest of the huts, and the dining room is pretty tiny and cozy. We asked if there was any food left, and they gave us a tray of pancakes that they had overcooked a bit that morning, and even gave us some real maple syrup! There was a German man named Andrei there who was sectioning. The day became overcast as we were heading out from the Hut. I pulled ahead of Buddha climbing out of the Notch, an incredibly ridiculous climb, but a little less steep and crazy than this morning. I made it to the top of Carter dome where the trail widens where an observation tower used to be, and continued on. There were nice views along the ridge of the other mountains, but it somehow felt unreal, somehow unimportant compared to the presidentials right behind me. It is also funny how big a loop the trail takes us in. Pinkham notch is only a two mile hike from the top of Washington, but the trail takes you around the summits and down through the GGW before spitting you out next to the Carters to start hiking north again. On top of Mt. Hight, Buddha caught up with me and we chatted with a few folks including a grandfather and his grandson from Alabama and a woman from north carolina. Buddha was ahead of me as I reached Zeta pass. I foudn a small creek and knowing that this was the last on trail water for nine miles, I filled up an extra liter for Buddha, whom i expected wouldn't grab any. The rest of the Carters passed quickly and uneventfully. There were a number of boardwalks over alpine bogs, but I was just trying to catch up with Buddha. The descent off of North Carter was incredibly sketchy. The trail then climbed back up along granite outcroppings to the top of Mt. Moriah, where I took a small side trail to the summit. Which was not really worth it. Now to drop 3000 feet down to Gorham.I saw that the trail began steeply and then leveled out into reasonability but it took far longer that I expected it would to do so. The trail began to follow the route of the Rattle River, and was pretty poorly maintained. i sometimes felt like I was bushwhacking along down a stream. I was probably just tired. I popped in some Lake Street Dive and all was better. I stopped in at Rattle River shelter and signed in behind Buddha and Lightning and Seal Tree and Goldie yesterday. I got a little turned around with the trail here, and ended up hiking back up from the river's edge because the trail walks right past the shelter instead.About .2 past the shelter I stopped to make a pretty momentous sign: 300 Miles to Katahdin! This is pretty crazy. The trail really feels like it's starting to wrap up. Tomorrow I am heading into Maine. A hundred more miles and I'll make it to Stratton and 2000, then a hundred and I'll be in Monson, heading into the 100 mile wilderness. Then, well: Katahdin. The trail here widens into gorgeous deciduous forest road, and I decided that walking would not cut it. I also found that the song Bobby Tanqueray matched up exactly to my running pace, so I began trail running down the length of the last two miles to Gorham. I figure Buddha must've done the same thing, and before me, too. At 6 PM, after 10 hours of crazy hiking, i was finally done. I came out onto Route 2, where a number of Southbounders were hitching a ride into town, and asked me about the hostel (which finds itself RIGHT on the trail). I went inside, saw Buddha, and got showered again. On the way to Walmart yesterday, I had seen a chinese buffet, and asked Marni if she could drop me off there. She was taking hikers to Walmart already and would drop me off and pick me up afterwards. The food hit the spot and I got a rather on-the-nose fortune cookie that told me that ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with one small step."" What about a journey of 2000 miles?? Two small steps, I spose. Back at the hostel, I was greeted with a few familiar faces! Wonka was there, who i had seen most recently, as was P-Stout, whom I left in Manchester, Heath Bar, all the way from RPH, and Sorority Steve, whom I'd met as Hot Rabbit all the way back in the Smokies. We regaled each other with stories, most about who knew who and where everyone was, which is basically all we talk about now. P-Stout explained how he got very sick in Manchester, and, having made the mistake of staying at a motel the first night, spent two more nights at Jeff Taussig's Green Mountain Hostel. Sorority Steve told me about the aftermath of the day I left him at Davenport Gap Shelter in the Smokies, taking a zero through the crazy snow that I avoided by being in Asheville, and the breakup of the little gang he was a part of, specifically how King Scum had essentially disappeared on them in Hot Springs after basically trying to get them to go on without him. King Arthur was apparently a while back, and Seam was still in front of us. Heath Bar took the bunk above mine. They are all planning to do the slackpack that I did today tomorrow. But rain is pretty seriously called for all day. Not really sure what'll happen. We'll call it in the morning.","White Mountains Lodge & Hostel via Pinkham Notch

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551588,"I surprisingly felt very little motivation to go today. With rain in the forecast for later today and all of tomorrow, and being so comfortable here at the hostel, I didn't really feel like getting up and going, even if it meant going to Maine. I surprised myself by it. Breakfast was a sort of pizza casserole type thing, but also there were some leftover breakfast burritos that I had. Wonka and Sorority Steve were around chatting in the morning, and Wonka began interviewing him for her project (I believe she is getting a little stipend from Duke for doing this and will write an ethnography paper on thru- hikers). She said she would interview me too if I wanted and it became harder to break away. Finally, leave I did. Along with all the other familiar faces I saw yesterday came the first wall of Sobos I had seen together, about eight of them. I guess that'll just sort of be the name of the game from here on in. Better start getting into camp earlier, I guess.The day's hiking began with a roadwalk across a dam of the Androscoggin River, which was frankly very pretty as roadwalks go. It turned left into the woods until finally spitting me out onto a trailhead for Mt. Hayes, which overlooks gorham to the west. The woods were very picturesque, and reminded me quite a bit of connecticut woods. As I ascended higher, though, they turned back into what i have come to expect from new hampshire, that is, open slabs of granite populated with a few shrubs and stands of trees. The sun was beating down heavily, and I got quite warm crossing these large open areas. Mt. Hayes had a number of false summits, and frustrated me. The trail, which has consistently gone by other names in the whites, became the Mahoosuc Trail, which is the last of the names other than simply the AT. The network of trails which I have been following for more than a week is fading away, and the AT is becoming once again the only trail around. The day was full of small ascents and descents of 1000 feet, and was pretty exhausting, what with my pack more full than it has been since North Adams or Kent. The trail also passed by numerous ponds, which are becoming more and more the theme of the trail.The last big climb of the day was mount Success, which I had been told was a real ass-kicker. It went pretty alright, nothing crazy, but it did feature a few scrambles that made me think about just what sort of terrain I am putting up with more regularly now. I had to heave myself over some climbs that simply are not thinkable anywhere in the south. Welcome to the Mahoosucs, I guess. Everyone said this is the hardest part. The other main trail difference is how much puncheon there is. Whenever I get to a flat place now, it seems to be covered in boardwalks in some state of decay. Every flat place in these parts is a bog I suppose. I crossed one such bog at the top of Mt. Success, and came out to a spit of rock, where a gold disk marks the summit. I took numerous pictures of ""Success,"" especially because this is the last peak in New Hampshire. The view back to the presidentials was lovely, and the view ahead to the Mahoosuc range was covered in mist, spooky. I descended off the mountain and into a little col, and then a few small climbs later, I found myself in a clearing with a sign I've been waiting to see for months, and indeed, years: Maine. I did not hesitate, but walked over to the sign and gave it a big hug, with a huge smile on my face. I had done it. I had walked from Georgia to Maine. This was a huge moment for me. Now with under 300 miles to go, and only one more state, the end is in sight. It's time to start counting down rather than up. Big K, here I come. I pushed on a little further up a hill to a turnoff for Carlo Col shelter. I wasn't hugely happy about having to go .2 off the trail downhill to the shelter, but with all the rain forecasted, I was not about to go stealth somewhere. Plus, even though it was only 4 o'clock, I was pooped. Today was hard. Down at the campsite were already two groups of boy scouts, one American the other Quebecois from their accents. They are all tented out, however. The shelter itself is a little cabin, with only an open doorway, with two shelves of bunks and a surprisingly bright interior. Inside were two women who are section hiking. I changed my clothes and set my things out to dry in the sun and the breeze outside. The water is pretty low right now with all the nice weather, and the water source was the first time in a while I've had to use a leaf. The rain that had been forecast to hit all afternoon held off almost the whole evening though, only beginning to drizzle right before I went to bed. Another Sobo came in late and we discussed challenging parts of the trail that lay in either direction. Tomorrow it's supposed to rain all day. If it's truly awful, there's no way I'm heading out, because first thing: the Mahoosuc Notch!","White Mountains Lodge & Hostel via Rt. 2. 
",Carlo Col Shelter ,"Jun 28, Tue",16.90
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551602,"It absolutely poured late last night. Not sure whether it woke me up, but I was certainly up at a certain point and pulled out my earplugs to hear the crazy rattling on the roof. Boy am I glad to be indoors. I was pretty uncertain about what to do today. I had even inured myself to the idea that I could just sit in the shelter all day and wait out this rain. Because's there's no way I'm attempting the Mahoosuc Notch in a downpour. But when I got up, I saw that it was really no more than a drizzle at the moment, and so I thought I might as well get going and at least make it a few miles. There was a lot of climbing today, but I powered through basically all of it, none of it hugely tiring me out . Objectively today had harder terrain than yesterday and though my pack was a bit lighter, it couldn't make that much of a difference. Hurmm. I dunno.The day started with sharp climbs up Mt. Carlo then Goose Eye and its separate peaks. A lot of the hike across Goose Eye was exposed alpine bog, and it was lovely to watch the mist flowing and rising around me. The weather patterns were intense today, and every time it cleared, I could see rainstorms around me, threatening. Also on top of Goose Eye were a huge pile of planks and logs, ready to be turned into puncheon. I guess they helicopter in supplies to the summit rather than have them get carried up. I made my way down to full goose shelter (named, i realize now, because it's between Goose Eye and Fulling Mill mountains) which is a long low lean to. I could hear a trail maintenance crew at work, and after I snack I continued on. The weather had been holding enough that I felt I could make my attempt at the Mahoosuc Notch. After waiting five minutes to let the trail crew finish up a bog bridge, I made my way up Fulling Mill Mountain then plummeted down to the start of the mahoosuc notch. On this descent, something bad happened: my shorts were basically a kilt already, with a giant hole in the middle but nothing really holding the front to the back. As I slid down a sketchy rock face, I felt them tear out from under me, then as I stood, I felt fabric touching all the way to my ankle. My poor shorts are not long for this world, as I just tore open a huge hole in the left cheek part. sigh.The Mahoosuc Notch! I felt a little scared going in by myself, because I knew how dangerous it could be, but everything worked out fine. It's incredibly cool and I loved it. The trail switches between narrow corridors of dense forest where you're never sure if you're on the trail to big boulder traverses that require quite a bit of coordination, and often risk your falling ten feet onto sharp rocks. I unclipped George about three times to push through little squeezes. I found ice, which was fun to see, and enjoyed hearing the sounds of the underground brook that runs beneath the rock jumbles. I somehow didn't get a single picture.It's surprisingly hard to find your way through the notch, and the blazing is very poor. The rocks were occasionally slick, but I only one time felt unsafe, when I was going too fast across a difficult jump. But after 40 minutes, I emerged out the other side and took a break in a little clearing, and filtered some water. Now, the harder part: making it up the Mahoosuc Arm, one of the most consistently steep ascents on the trail. To make things harder, about a third of the way up, it began to rain. I mean rain rain. The slabs of rock became incredibly treacherous, and the rooty footing became slick and muddy. I passed another hiker in a poncho who looked pretty at a loss. It's funny how trail building works in maine. It's not that there aren't hand and footholds, it's just that the trail is basically cleared of trees and that's it. They leave the res of the route for you to figure out. The trail feels very natural.I reached the top and didn't slow down a bit, wanted to get to the neearby Speck Pond Shelter and out of this crazy rain. I moved quickyl over the half mile down to the shoreline of Speck Pond, but as I got to the edge, lightning flashed and the skies just opened up, and I found myself half running towards the shelter. I continued onto the shelter side trail without hesitation and after some rock jumping found myself under the roof of Speck Pond Shelter. And so I began to wait. Along with me were two sobos whose names I didn't catch. The man in the poncho showed up and soon revealed himself to be kind of a condescending asshole who didn't know when to stop. Soon also arrived a middle-aged couple who were planning to head to Andover on their section but decided they might call it quits at Grafton Notch because they simply weren't enjoying themselves. She looked incredibly cold, but did the right thing and changed immediately into dry clothes. Lightning struck very close to us a couple of times, probably hitting the pond behind the shelter. This is a pretty popular shelter at other times of the year, and had a caretaker, who would charge us 5$ if we intended to stay. Michael came to visit us down in the lean-to. I asked if he had a weather report and he said no. I spent the next little bit in my underwear hile my clothes dripped a little, my phone in hand as I attempted to check the weather. I had cell service but no data, so I called my father to ask if he could look it up for me. After some serious phone troubles, I finally got from him the information that the rain was going to slacken off through the rest of the evening. Basically, it would get no worse.I took heart in that, and though I had considered staying put for the rest of the evening, decided that ten miles just wasn't going to cut it. And so as the rain petered out for a bit, I headed off. The next climb was among my favorites of the whole trip, up an arm of Old Speck Mountain. The trail followed a spine of rock up and down and up again, and it had wonderful 270 degree views the whole time. The fog was lifting around me, and I could see the weather patterns shifting. It was an extremely beautiful moment, and I hiked, determined to take advantage of the break in the weather. I opted not to go the extra side trail to the fire tower, as I wanted to make miles. It is maine's third-highest mountain, which is surprising, actually. The descent down to Grafton Notch passed without incident. There was a very beautiful moment of looking across the notch to the Baldpate range beyond, and seeing the road I was descending towards. But no photos today; too wet. The weather had all but cleared as I came down to Grafton notch, and I was glad; I had been worried it would pour on me again at any moment as I descended Old Speck. God bless quick dry clothing. I crossed my first road in maine, and began my climb up the Baldpates, the next range of mountains I will be passing over. Mountains seem to come much more in ranges up here, and the big peaks can often be separated into chunks. It makes me happy to see that I've only got about 7 more days of peak climbing and then maine begins to flatten out. The trail up the baldpates was well graded and nice, and the sun was out, and I moved pretty happily along the trail towards my shelter for the evening. I was expecting it to be decently empty, but when I arrived, the shelter was completely full with a number of nobos, sobos and sectioners. Among them were Uberscout and Lost Giggles, whose entries I'd been following for a while, as well as Working Class, who is picking up Sobo where he left off last year and likes to build big fires. He reminds me of Skeebo. I'm sure my displeasure at finding a full shelter somewhat showed. Anyway. I went to set up my tent in some nice woods just in front of the shelter. As I was changing inside my tent, it decided to rain heavily for about three minutes. Blarrrrrgh, I wish my tent could've just stayed dry. Whatever. I'm happy that i ended up being able to get 16 miles in today, when I was ready to have taken a zero. I eventually warmed up to the other folks in the shelter and had a decent evening. I just always feel kinda cheated when I've done way more miles than people and they get shelter spots. But that's wrong of me. I asked some of the southbound people If they'd seen Lightning and Seal Tree and Goldie, and they said they had. They apparently put in quite a day into Maine, heading all the way from Gorham to Full Goose shelter, and tonight were probably already in Andover. Tomorrow will be into Andover for me. I'm proud of myself for making it in just three days through this tough section. I'll stay at a hostel there. It's funny thinking theres only three resupplies left, Andover, Stratton, Monson.... WOOWWWWWW","Carlo Col Shelter 
",Baldpate Lean-to,"Jun 29, Wed",16.40
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551615,"I knew I had a big day ahead of me trying to get into town in time to actually get town things done, so I got up relatively early and was out before most folks. My tent was still quite damp, but such is life. I'm a bit spoiled when it comes to tenting, and really like it when my tent is dry. The day began with a consistently steep hike up to the top of the Baldpates. As I neared the top of the West Peak, the trees fell away to open slabs of rock, and the wind began to howl. The climbing was frankly pretty sketchy, and was a bit worrying. I felt I was getting blown off of the mountain. It was also hard to tell where I was going, as the mist obscured the blazes and the cairns. As the I crossed the West peak, though, conditions improved immensely, as the mountain blocked most of the wind. The clouds were clearing and I could see for miles around to some huge and beautiful ponds to my west. This part of Maine frankly looked gentle, and it was an interesting change of pace to feel less surrounded by mountains. The middle of the day passed in relatively quiet. Dunn falls were incredibly beautiful; a lot of these Maine waterfalls are just gouged out rock faces with streams running gorgeously down them. The run-up to Wyman mountain was long. At Hall mountain lean-to i found a familiar face in the form of Booty, who was taking a nap. I stepped aside to set up my hostel pickup for that evening, and left him a note to wake up to. After the lean to, the trail dropped precipitously down to Sawyer notch, where I met a sobo with a guitar. The next climb was up Moody Mountain, which I had been looking forward to as one of the steepest sections in the entire AWOL guide, climbing 1400 feet in .9 miles. The climb tuckered me out in a way that very few have recently, way more than Mahoosuc Arm or Old Speck. I had to take multiple breaks on the way up. The trail was heavily improved here, with rebar and staples in the rock, and a few sections where log gutters have been built into the sides of the granite faces to keep the dirt there. As I had been instructed, I called Pine Ellis Lodging from the top of moody mountain, and they told me they would meet me down at South Arm Road, but I would have to hurry to get in one van that was nearby, because they were picking up a bunch of sobos, or else have to wait for another round. So I hurried down from the top of Moody Mtn, and came out onto the road. Eventually a big Honda Previa pulled up driven by a woman named Roberta. We waited around for fifteen minutes or so for the sobos, but they did not show up, so Roberta and I just drove into town. She gave me a small tour of the town, which is just based around a single block. It's flat and very tiny, comprising really only a gas station and a couple of stores. Probably the smallest place I've resupplied. She then dropped me off at Pine Ellis, where I was readily given a muffin and instructed to take a shower. I did just that and picked out a bunk for myself. I was pretty late in arriving and ravenous with hunger. I went over to the general store to get some dinner and resupply. I truly didn't need much in terms of resupply, because, funnily enough, a plan I've been hoping would work out all summer is coming to fruition! When I came home for graduation, my family friend Dave Monz informed me that they have a cabin in Oquossoc, ME, near Rangeley, and would be headed up there for the days before the 4th of July. I told him that frankly that was right around when I was planning to get there, and I would love to meet up! And so, with Rangeley now added in to my resupply, I only needed one night's worth of food. I already had some left over from Gorham, because I had been hedging my bets of whether I'd take a zero at a shelter. i did pick up a new toothbrush, though, as my toothrush from Georgia has been ripped to shreds. I ordered a big steak and cheese sub from the lunch counter at the general store and chatted with another hiker who showed up who is also staying at Pine Ellis. Andover seems to have about the most ancient population of any town I'd seen, and I remembered learning that Maine, not Florida, has the highest median age of any US state. I headed back to the hostel, where I put in some laundry, dried out my tent, drank a couple beers and chatted with some of the hikers, including Lord Snotrocket, who is slackpacking this section while his daughter is out hiking the whole AT, and Raptor, a girl about my age who hiked nobo last year and is back for a sobo hike this year. I was up for a while futsing with the dryer, which kept insisting on turning off, but eventually I turned in with clean clothes, excited that only three more towns remain of my trip.","Baldpate Lean-to
","Andover, ME, via South Arm Rd.","Jun 30, Thu",18.10
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551687,"Not all too much happened today, just another day hiking along the AT. There's going to be tough days from here on out, but the very hardest of the climbing along the AT is behind me now, and the miles are starting to feel like miles again, especially on days like today when there wasn't too much to look forward to in terms of terrain. I was up surprisingly early given that I went to bed after everybody else. There were muffins in the kitchen, of which I had two, and made ready to head back to the trail. Some confusion as to who was going where meant I didn't get out til about 8:30; I would've loved to get an earlier start, because it looked like it was going to be a sunny hot day. The climb up to Old Blue mountain was tough, but nothing I haven't done before. Most of the rest of the day's hiking found itself along a ridge with small ups and downs but no more serious climbs. The trail was drier and in better shape than most I've seen in Maine, which surprised me given that I expect that this is one of the least-travelled sections of the AT in Maine. The scenery was more open conifers reminiscent of eastern Vermont, and the sun was hot with all the open space. I did have one fun interaction today: At about 10:30, I came across a southbounder wearing chaco sandals, a tunic made out of an oversize t-shirt and a pack made from axe handles, leather and nylon plastic. I don't know how, but I immediately knew who he was, and asked him if he was Handmade, to which he responded yes. He made his own pack, which apparently weighs about 15 pounds. Yeesh. Funnily enough, I knew about him through Willard, because the two had met while Willard was out on a prep hike in Virginia, while Handmade was there starting on the trail. He has walked north from Catawba VA to Katahdin and has now turned around and is hiking south, because he says ""he's not done."" He's not how far he'll get, and says he may go as far as PA then skip back to Catawba. He is an absolute sight to see, and can talk your ear off. I love how the trail is filled with such characters. I eventually descended to Bemis Stream, which the AWOL guide lists as a possible ford, but was easily rock hoppable. The water is pretty low, and very few of the fords have materialized so far. I then hiked up the side of a large hill to ME route 17, which could lead me into Rangeley if I wanted it to. I asked Dave Monz whether he would be able to pick me up here and then drop me off for a slackpack tomorrow between here and route 4, but unfortunately he's not headed up until very late today, so I will miss him. At the road crossing, i took a small side trip to a highway overlook known as Height of Land, where the road crests the mountain range, and has just an incredible view of Mooslookmeguntic, the largest of the Rangeley Lakes.The rest of the day's hiking was pretty tame, around small hillsides with good views of little ponds. In similar news, loon calls are becoming less of a rarity and more of a certainty, what with all these shelters next to ponds. It is a song that reminds me of summertime and camping, and makes me immensely happy.I pulled into Sabbath Day Pond at about 4:30, and decided that was enough considering I only had about 9 miles to go down into rt 4 tomorrow to meet Dave Monz. With me tonight are an older southbounder couple called the mixed berries (who told me about how they recently had to send their dog, blackberry, home) and much later a southbounder named Heart Attack showed up. I liked her dry sense of humor, and we traded stories.The general wisdom from the southbounders I met today, especially Handmade, is not to be afraid of the 100 mile wilderness or Katahdin. It's all doable from here on in. Alright, gnight!","Andover, ME, via South Arm Rd.
",Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to,"Jul 01, Fri",17
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551688,"Ahh. Another sort of break day. I beat Heart Attack out of the shelter but was behind the Mixed Berries, but still made it out in decent time to meet Dave at our appointed hour of 10:40. The hiking was a little tougher than I was expecting, but I feel that's always how it goes with sections in which you're going to meet someone and just want to get to the end. The trail was pretty wide and nice through the whole section, though, and I moved quickly. I figure people from Rangeley must use it pretty often. The sun was shining nicely when I came out to Route 4. I didn't see Dave in the lot, so I went and crossed the road and sat on a fence on the other side, drying out my damp socks and basking. I noticed a van with a connecticut plate pull in a few minutes later and picked up my stuff to go meet Dave!We were both very excited to see each other, and amazed that our paths were able to cross without so much as a blink; everything has worked out pretty great. Also he seemed just as excited to host me as I was to be hosted! We piled into the car and drove west toward Rangeley, talking about the trip, about his daughter Lauren who was a good friend from high school, about the history of Oquossoc, where their cabin is. Our first stop was the IGA supermarket, where I picked up the few supplies I would need to get to Stratton, only two days away. Unfortunately, I wasn't used to the store's layout and felt bad for taking a while with Dave in tow. Also, given the remoteness of the town, the supplies were a little pricier than, say, walmart. We then drove into the very cute town of Rangeley (which sits between two lakes acting as a PORTAGE ROUTE hahaha) and stopped in at Ecopelagicon, an outfitter right next to the lake. I needed three items, which given their minimal description in AWOL I was not expecting them to have, but indeed they had aqua mira, black diamond pole tips and a gas canister that would work with my stove. I was very happy, because I had run out of the chlorine drops, which I like for water in camp, and my pole tips had broken off AGAIN. This is becoming unsustainable. We drove out of town to the Monzes' cabin in Oquossoc, which is part of a compound belonging to a fishing club, which was apparently set up by folks from New Haven and New York almost a century ago. The cabin itself is lovely and cozy, with a really airy sitting/dining room, and lots of homey decoration. I did some laundry, ate a lot of leftover chicken, and hopped in the shower. I also met Lauren's older sister Morgan and her boyfriend Jeff, who now both lead river trips out west, as well as Bryce, the Monzes' lab. I was planning on vegging out all afternoon, but Dave suggested we all go on a little paddling trip. So we loaded up a canoe and a couple kayaks into cars and drove to a river put-in that apparently would lead us right back to the cabin. The weather was being fickle and moved from sunny to spitting rain and windy a few times. It was really fun to be on the water though, doing a sort of physical activity that I haven't done in a while. It was also fun for me to sit back and do nothing and let the river carry me. That's a nice thing about paddling that is just not the same as hiking. You can take a break and still be moving. Bryce was with us and sat in the middle of Jeff and Morgan's canoe, but he was unhappy whenever Dave - who was in a kayak, like me - was more than a few feet from him and kept yelping and whining until he came closer. This came to a head when we went down the one rapid along the river, and Bryce decided to jump out at a critical moment and pushed one of the gunwales underwater, forcing Jeff and Morgan both to hop out mid-river. Morgan spent much of the rest of the time holding Bryce from jumping in again (which he tried to do multiple times). The twists and turns of the river looked a lot like the paddling I've done in Quebec, and it ended up being a lovely outing. the river led right back into the inlet where the cabin is, and we pulled up all the boats on shore. It was funny how easily I switched from hiking mode into chilling mode. I took a nap and spent much of the afternoon reading Deadeye Dick, which I found on a shelf. I haven't read a book in a while now, and Vonnegut engrossed me, so I was almost halfway done with the novel in a few hours. The dinner plan was to have a barbeque with Dana - Lauren's younger sister - and her high school friends, who were all two years below me in school. We headed over to the main cabin where Dave fired up the grill and I caught up with some of the folks who were there, including Jimmy, whom I'd played football with, and Chas, who now goes to St. Andrews in Scotland. (we talked for a while about Brexit, which I had heard about mainly from Roller who is sad because she says ""she can't call herself European anymore""). We drank a fair bit and I ate lots of cheese and crackers while we waited for steaks and burgers and the like, which came out late, but were very delicious. This is one of the few true nearos i have taken on the trail, and it was incredibly nice. Dave, Morgan and Dana, thank you so much for sharing your house and your food and your kindness with me. This was one of my most memorable days on the trail.","Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to
",Oquossoc vie ME Rt. 4,"Jul 02, Sat",9.40
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551690,"I knew today was going to be a long long day of hiking, and Dave offered to get up at any time, so we were on the road by 6:30. We stopped in Rangeley for a bacon egg and cheese and some coffee before heading back to the trailhead. Right before the AT, we saw the huge form of a moose, antlered and enormous this time, cross the road and head back into the woods to our right. I was just slightly too slow with the camera. I thanked Dave and said goodbye. He wished me good luck and a happy independence day! I then crossed the road one more time and picked up where I left off. The trail headed up through dense conifer forest and wound through ravines approaching the main bulk of the Saddlebacks, one of the highlights of Maine, and one of the last ranges of true mountains on the Trail. I eschewed stopping at the Caves next to Piazza rock and continued on. the climb up to Eddy Pond was surprisingly challenging, clambering through natural rock formations and up rooty gullies. Once again, Maine trailblazers seem to have cut down a few tress but not done anything really to improve these trails. It's more natural feeling, but tiring. Just after Eddy Pond, I got a call from none other than Lightning! After some futsing with reception I finally got a clear signal and we chatted. As usual, while I do steady miles, he, Seal Tree and Goldie alternate big miles and days off. They took a day off in Andover at the Cabin, which was apparently their favorite hostel ever, then put in another couple big days, and after my short day in rangeley, I was still a day behind them; they would be pulling into Stratton later on this evening. I told them they needed to do whatever they wanted, but I would love to see them.The climb up Saddleback began in earnest after the pond, ascending pretty consistently through ever-thinning conifers. The day was clear, but the wind was blowing brutally from the east, the hardest I've felt all trip. Fortunately, it was warm enough I didn't need to break out my raincoat, but I still was hiking at an angle all morning. As I hit treeline, I heard a sound behind me and found Speed Limit, one of the three hikers we had met back in the whites at Mizpah Spring Hut that Large had said ""would sleep in a ditch."" While we had sort of been surly to him at Mizpah, he and I had a lovely chat and we paced each other for a little before I let him blow by me. The trio's routine is to get up around 4 or 5, hike very quickly and be done by noon or just after. The Saddlebacks truly are a gem, a very long open ridgeline, covered in moss and little shrubs, with a great view away to the rangeley lakes to the west and some of the higher peaks in all of Maine to the north. The hiking was easy over the flat tops of the three summits - Saddleback, the Horn and Saddleback Junior (which Ali says sounds like a kid's menu at a BBQ chain - but dropped away pretty impressively on either side. The descent off of Saddleback Junior was particularly sketchy, steep and poorly maintained because most people approach the range from the south or west, not the north. I pulled ahead of Speed limit on Saddleback Junior, and sat down to eat some lunch at Poplar Ridge Lean-to. Speed Limit showed up, as did Blazer and their buddy whose name i cannot remember for the life of me. They were done for the day, having come from Sabbath Day Pond, over 20 miles, and it wasn't even noon yet! Jeez they go quick. As they laid out for a nap, I packed up and pushed on. After dropping off of the ridge, the trail began to follow a number of streams on old logging roads. The hiking was very pleasant, and a nice change from the brutal blast of wind all morning. There were some lovely cascades at Orbeton stream, and I sat by Sluice brook for a while on a logging road just enjoying the water and the small view.The ascent up towards Mt. Abraham was strange in that it consisted largely of puncheon on top of bare rock between areas of moss, with streams flowing underneath the planks. I ended up doubling back at one point to grab water from under on of the bridges. The climb up Lone mountain was taxing and took longer than I expected. I figured I would have the hard stuff done in the morning, over Saddleback.The trail flattened from here though and wove through dark dense forest towards Spaulding Mountain Lean-to. As i passed the first entrance to the loop trail for the shelter, I heard lots of voices, and worried I would miss a spot in the shelter; but fortunately, the voices were coming from a large group from a girls' camp, who were all tented out, and the shelter was basically empty. I filled up water from the lovely stream nearby and sat out on the shelter's front, recovering from the long day. Two section hikers showed up, as did two nerdy young sobos, Woody and Noodles, whom I got along with quite well. I also talked quite a bit with the two leaders of the girl's group, and the group themselves, who asked me lots of questions about my hike. As the only Nobo there, I was on the hook for lots of information, but I was happy to supply it. It drizzled a couple of times through the evening, but nothing serious. Noodles was incredibly excited to start using vegetable oil for cooking, because he was getting tired of the taste of olive oil, and quickly realized that vegetable oil just does not taste that good.Today was one of the last days of consistently mountainous hiking that I will have on the trail. Tomorrow promises to be an important day, too: I'll climb over the Crocker Peaks, then head down into Stratton - on my way, I will pass the 2000 mile marker.

I ate some of the girls' oatmeal that they could not finish, which was a nice supplement to my food this morning. They got out about five minutes before I did, on account of me leaving my stuff everywhere and forgetting to pack it up. Reverting back to old ways. And so I passed them about five minutes into hiking. The AT feels kind of strange in this section because it is surprisingly flat, and does not ascend the big mountains around it - Abraham, Sugarloaf. I passed over Spaulding Mtn., but decided not to head up the steep side trail to the top. A mile or so later, I came to a pretty interesting plaque on a boulder, which explained that near this spot in 1937, the last section of the AT was cut, completing the trail running from Georgia to Maine. The golden spike of the trail, if you will. Just a little bit beyond that, I paused to make another sign, this one reading K: 200, for 200 miles left to Katahdin. I passed along the along a ridge before leaving behind a turn-off for Sugarloaf and heading down into the Caribou valley. For a quarter mile at one point, the trail opened up into a rounded cirque without trees, giving a wonderful view across to the Crockers and out towards the Bigelows to the north. The trail was rocky and dusty in this section, and i had to leap across a couple sketchy slides that looked ripe for an injury.The trail evened out and followed the path of the Carrabassett River for a little while, which I then crossed with the help of a rickety 2x8 plank placed across boulders above the main flow of the stream. The climb up the Crockers was totally reasonable up to Crocker Cirque Campsite, where I stopped for some water, and Speed Limit passed me. Then, it got ridiculous. The whole trail was just like a staircase, climbing and climbing and climbing up vertically the side of this mountain. There were some cool views, though, especially where the AT climbed up an old rock slide; I could see the ridgeline of the bigelows extremely well, where I'll hike tomorrow. The trail got a little easier climbing up and over the two humps of Crocker mountain, but still, I was exhausted. As I was heading down from North Crocker, about 11 am, I got another call from Lightning: he, goldie and seal tree were all still in Stratton, debating what to do: they had slept in and gotten breakfast, but hadn't resupplied yet, and were considering taking the day off. I tried not to sway Lightning, but I'm sure I couldn't contain my excitement or my bias: I really wanted to catch them and see them! I told him I was about 90 minutes out from stratton (which was probably underestimating it, but I wanted to make it happen), and he said they would at least wait for me so I could see them. I basically ran down Crocker Mountain, just so excited to get to Stratton. Nearing the bottom, i had to stop and take a picture at a wooden sign on the ground which marks 2000 miles from Springer. Holy crap, man. I can taste Katahdin. At about 1, the trail let me out at a small parking lot, and I crossed the road and began to hitch. I didn't have to wait very long before getting picked up and dropped in the middle of the small town of stratton. And who should I find right outside the grocery store? Lightning, Seal Tree and Goldie!!I was so amped to see them. After tailing them since New Jersey, and getting a tantalizing glimpse in Gorham, I was finally back with familiar faces and good friends. It seems we all had decent reasons to stay in Stratton today: Seal Tree, Goldie and I were each expecting a package at the post office, and with its being a holiday today, it looked like they wouldn't be in until at least tomorrow morning. Goldie's I believe had some food and supplies, while Seal Tree's I think was just a care package from his parents. Mine was a new pair of boots. My boots, which were new in New Jersey, have been taking a beating. They have a couple of holes in the uppers, one of the soles is beginning to debond and the laces are fraying off. At least the insoles I bought in Killington are working well; my feet did not get sore even on all the new hampshire rocks. And so my arrival seems like it convinced the three of them to stay in town. They had slept at the White Wolf Inn last night, and had apparently gotten a pretty good deal. We went there for lunch, and as I dug in to a giant burger and some beer, we asked whether they had any rooms available tonight. The only one available was a suite that would be large even for four of us, so we went across the street to the stratton motel, where we got set up with two double beds for the evening. So with that, we were not about to waste our half day off. I showered up, then we walked across the street to the general store, where I did some resupply and we got some more beer to celebrate the 4th! Outside the store we met Blazer and Speed Limit, who were about to hitch back out and camp a few miles further along, as well as a Sobo whose buddy just quit the trail on him. YeeshWe ended up sitting around in the motel room for a lot of the rest of the day, watching Saving Private Ryan and Forrest Gump on AMC, two pretty quintessentially American movies. Seal Tree and Goldie have a pretty silly dynamic, making lots of jokes and doing weird things. Lightning repeatedly told me ""thank god you're here now,"" because at least he has someone to talk to about their antics. It's a fun lil group. Around 8 we went searching for more food. We probably should've gone earlier: all that was really open was the gas station and I ended up buying some questionable soba noodles and a pastry or two to eat. Another burger would've hit the spot. But we stumbled home back to the motel room and ate the food and headed to bed.","Spaulding Mountain Lean-To

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551697,"I didn't sleep well at all last night. Some combination of beer from the afternoon and gas station noodles did not sit well in my stomach, and i ended up in the bathroom multiple times overnight. We were up by about 7:30 but stuck around the motel room cleaning and packing for a little before heading over to the Looney Moose, a breakfast and lunch spot that my three companions had gone to yesterday morning and said was pretty good. I got a big plate of corned beef hash and had some of Goldie's french toast as well. WE then walked back the motel and they all went to resupply. I spent a fair bit of time waiting around since I had done my resupply yesterday, but it was a pleasant morning in a little stand of trees outside the motel. As we got ready to head out of town, we stopped by the post office one more time. Seal Tree's package had shown up, but Goldie's and mine were not due until probably later that afternoon. But we were done waiting around and wanted to get back out there. We told the post office to try and bump the packages to Monson if and when they arrived, so hopefully they will be there when we arrive in four days. It's absolutely insane to think that we have one more resupply, one more trail town left. It's also funny thinking back to the beginning of the trip, when all of the places were just names on a map or an itinerary; each trail town has its own culture and things going for it, and now I've been to almost all of them. Right outside the post office, a man asked us whether we were headed back to the trail and gave us a hitch back up to the trailhead. And so we set off, i leading for a fair bit of the hiking. This is the first time I've paced with a larger group in a very long time. We passed a number of outdated signs marking 2000 miles, including one written on the pavement of a road, where we passed a group from the same girl's camp as the group at Spaulding Mtn. We successively split up with each other as the climbing became more difficult.It was a longer hike than I was anticipating, but not nearly as hard as Crocker yesterday. But we were also starting later. Lightning and I both hit a spectacular viewpoint at the same moment, from which we could see Horns Pond, a lovely little lake that hovers thousands of feet above the rest of the Maine landscape, surrounded by the Horns, twin peaks rising 600 feet from its shore.We took a break at a little day-use shelter near Horns Pond. When I arrived there was a man whom I recognized, but couldn't place him. It turns out it was Paul, whom I'd met taking a shuttle out of Hiawassee and seen last at Long Branch shelter, right before Franklin in NC! He had lost a ton of weight and grown a bushy beard, but I recognized him by his shirt, which just has a drawing of a rock on it. He had made it to Harper's Ferry about two weeks ago, and now flip flopped to Katahdin and was heading south. I applauded him for his tenacity, but my goodness, he is on track to finish the trail in like 8 months. I can't imagine spending that much time out here. Lightning and I paced each other up South Horn, which was pretty brutal, but had a lovely view to the rest of the Bigelow ridgeline. We descended and climbed again now up to the top of the highest peak in the range, West peak, where the Bigelows officially became my favorite part of Maine so far. There is an incredibly weightlessness to the ridge, as though we were floating high above Maine below us. Seal Tree and Goldie caught up and we all walked over to Avery Peak, where we had a very late lunch on the foundations of a fire tower. The peak is named for Myron Avery, the details man to Benton Mackaye's visionary. One of my absolute favorite peaks so far, with just some incredible views.By 4, we dropped 2 miles down to Safford Notch, and I was flagging. Lightning, Seal Tree and Goldie all got ahead of me. I also tried calling the Stratton post office to see if my package arrived, but ended up in some limbo of the phone and postal system, which just pissed me off. My lack of sleep caught up with me, and all I wanted was to get to Little Bigelow Lean-to, which was still 5.5 miles away. The climb up Little Bigelow was also surprisingly rugged, with tons of little rises that tired me out even more and annoyed me, because I was expecting easy climbing. To make things worse, the spring I was expecting halfway up was nonexistent (what with all the dry weather), and I had run out of the small bit of watered I'd filtered from a small boxed spring on the side of Avery peak. But push on I did, and I was heartened when I found the trio sitting on some ledges looking back at West and Avery, waiting for me. Lightning decided to take a short nap in the afternoon sun, the other three of us moving on. The hiking became somewhat easier at this point, and the company helped keep my pace up. The Ledges on the east side of the mountain were pretty glorious, one of those classic Maine moments of open slabs of rock with little dots of trees and moss. The descent down to Little Bigelow Lean-to was then pretty gentle. We found the lean-to already with a number of people at it, mostly section hikers, but a few sobos and one older flip-flopper named Timeline whom the other three knew but I'd never met. I snagged a spot in the shelter along with Timeline, while the other three decided to camp out. All three of them use hammocks, actually, and pretty much always prefer that to shelters. Me, I'm still in my old routine as a shelter rat. I was saddened that the river which flows next to the shelter - which is famous because it has carved out a great swimming hole called the Tubs - was barely more than a trickle. We had a pretty relaxed evening, except for one Sobo who made an ass of himself by claiming we had no idea the kind of terrain we were going to face in the 100 - the chairback range he referred to as ""CATHEDRALS OF ROCK"" - and also by insultingly telling Goldie - who was just trying to make conversation - that the fact that she had time for a thru hike meant she didn't have a life. Dude needs to let the wilderness in and relax. also: he was from canada! c'mon! don't give us a bad name! This is probably the most exhausted I've been after only 15 miles. But damn. Now we get a couple of days of much flatter, doable terrain!","Stratton, ME via Rt. 27
",Little Bigelow Lean-to,"Jul 05, Tue",15.30
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551742,"Didn't sleep too well last night. It's a fight now between taking my sleeping bag off because it's too hot and covering up my exposed skin to keep it away from mosquitoes. I'm pretty chewed up this morning. I found Seal Tree sleeping on the bench in front of the shelter, though. Apparently the bugs were even worse for him in his hammock and he couldn't take it. Not sure how sleeping on the bench solved that though, haha.We were off pretty early, around 6:30 and finished up the descent from the Bigelows and now faced a day pretty much of flat terrain. We chatted about the abusive Canadian from last night, and Seal Tree did an impression that went ""Yeah, Goldie, I don't have time to be a dirt bum hippie bitch!"" that put me in hysterics. Right off the bat we hit the shore of flagstaff lake and took a break to enjoy the shoreline. A great deal of the route today follows the path of Benedict Arnold's portage route on his expedition to invade Quebec. There were lots of signs that read ""portage"" and had the insignia I draw in logbooks, so I stopped for many pictures. I also had thought that being part of a group would bring a higher sense of motivation to each of us, that we would rely on each other for a willingness to finish the trail. It's true, that did happen to me last night, but there's also some building negative energy that sometimes arises. Seal Tree's hatred of bugs is mostly something to laugh at, but it's clear that Lightning just wants to be done with this trail, and vented his frustration a couple of times today. We took a very relaxing break about halfway through the day at Arnold's Point Beach that helped everyone relax a little bit. It's a lovely spot out on a peninsula heading into West Carry Pond. We skipped a lot of rocks and waited for Goldie to catch up, and she told us about some crazy Sobos at West Carry Pond shelter a little while back. It was a picture perfect day, with just a couple of clouds and wonderful blue skies. We pulled into Pierce Pond lean-to around 2:45, and decided there was no real sense in moving on: four miles ahead was the Kennebec River, over which you must get ferried across in a canoe. The ferry runs between 9 and 11 and 2 and 4, and since we could cover the miles in just over an hour, we figured we would just be waiting there tomorrow morning anyway. Seal Tree was of the opinion that we should just ford it but we convinced him otherwise. Crazy ol Seal Tree. We set up camp; the other folks hammocked out - indeed, Seal Tree and Goldie decided to combine their hammocks and tarps into a ""fort"" - while I picked out a spot in the shelter. There are a number of other folks here, including a German couple sectioning, two army buddies with the largest jetboil pot you will ever see, two flip floppers named Daisy Duke and Buttercup and a Nobo whom the other three had met named Professor Dude (who is funnily enough a vegetarian who makes an exception for bacon). We decided to have some naptime, and I ended up reading a couple of chapters of Lord of the Flies out loud to Seal Tree and Goldie while I lay under their hammocks. The other impetus for staying despite our early arrival is that just a few tenths of a mile away is Harrison's, a camp of rustic cabins that apparently serves a hell of a breakfast. The four of us walked over on the little spur trail past some impressive cascades on Pierce Pond Stream to Harrison's to sign up for spots at breakfast. The place is kind of like a shantytown, with a bridge across the stream made up of old wooden pallets. I opted for the full experience of eggs sausage and pancakes, as did most folks. We walked back up to camp and considered taking a swim but were discourage by some of the largest leeches we had ever seen swimming in the water. Seal Tree found a stick with some fishing line on it and tried to catch something, to no avail. It was nice to be in camp, but I honestly thought I would enjoy these flat sections more than I have. I was looking forward to the break, but without the challenge of crazy terrain, it's starting to feel like miles. I honestly think my enjoyment of the section may be hindered by a faster pace and by the folks around me. I'm certainly not leaving the group, but I just wonder.","Little Bigelow Lean-to
",Pierce Pond Lean-to,"Jul 06, Wed",17.70
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551744,"Today was pretty bleak; exhausting, long and wet. I don't know if I really slept at all last night; tons of bugs kept me awake, and if I wasn't swatting them, someone else in the shelter was. Not sure why I didn't just tent out. I was the first one moving around in the shelter this morning, and felt bad for waking people up around me, but it was already late for us; we took a chiller morning because we knew we had Harrison's waiting for us. Seal Tree was sleeping on the ground again. I guess the fort didn't work out too well. It was overcast and drizzly as we packed up to head to breakfast. First off we crossed the Pierce Pond Dam, which is made of sketchy dilapidated fencing and logs, and might've been a ford in higher water. We then headed down to the spur trail to Harrison's and once more crossed the crazy pallet bridge. We headed into the main cabin and checked in for breakfast, while Mr. Harrison was flying around the kitchen getting everything prepared. The cabin itself is quite an amazing place: it's exactly what you think of when you think maine hunting cabin: uneven wooden floors, bookcases, a bearskin rug, moose on the wall. There was even an old pool table that had shims under its legs to keep it even. There were about a dozen of us for breakfast, not including the German couple, who are apparently old friends of our host, and we all sat down to eat. First up was eggs and sausage, which were tasty, and then the famous 11 pancakes. They were thin like crepes, and had fruit fried right into them, and combined with real syrup, were some of the best pancakes I've ever had. But even I barely finished, even after taking a break. It was a ton of food. Loved it. We headed out through the drizzle - after I enjoyed the use of a flush toilet - and made our way over the four miles to the Kennebec. The terrain - which looked very tame on the guide - was actually quite rugged, with a lot of little climbs back up the riverbank, rocks and log bridges. There was one especially fun bridge where the railings sloped downward and finally left you balancing on two thin logs. The trail wore on my nerves. There were some very pretty cascades to our right, though.We eventually made it down to the Kennebec, where a big sign tells you that camping is not allowed. The ferry was on the other side when we arrived, and hung around there waiting for some sobo to get out of the outhouse that is up on the bank. hrmph. While we were waiting, though, some friends showed up! Sorority Steve had been camping just past West Carry Pond and had gotten up very early. Apparently Heath Bar was just behind.The canoe can only carry two at a time, so when it finally came across, Seal Tree and I went first. We had to put on PFDs and sign waivers. I was up in the bow and was frustrated with the guy in charge in the stern because you're supposed to paddle on the downstream side in the stern when ferrying, and he was on the upstream... The flow was not strong enough to make too much difference, but cmon. Seal Tree and I hung out on the other bank waiting for Lightning and Goldie. It's a shame there's no camping allowed, it's literally a perfect camping spot over here. Once we were all across, we pushed on, but immediately we hit a road. Seal Tree and Goldie both wanted to head into the small town of Caratunk where there is a general store, but Lightning and I just wanted to get going. So we parted ways and pushed on. This next section was on old logging roads next to streams, and was actually quite lovely, the sort of hiking I was expecting from these more flat sections of maine. Lightning and I paced each other and moved very quickly. We were at lower elevation and the deciduous forest was more reminiscent of Vermont. Eventually we came to the first of two big climbs on the day, Pleasant Pond mountain. It actually seems like a pretty well-used day hiking trail, so the tread was very wide going up, similar to Stratton. The top, though, was a different story. It was cold and foggy and drizzling and blustery up top, and I was not enjoying myself. more like UnPleasant Pond Mountain. The open ledges - which I'm sure are spectacular on a good day - were just conduits for cold air, and I rushed along trying to keep warm. Since it was raining a lot, I had not checked the elevation profile, which would have shown me that there are about five false summits heading down the other side: as it was, I just got pissed at the mountain, because I kept thinking it was over just to find another rise in front of me. Lightning and I had gotten separated just before the summit but met up right near the bottom. Seal Tree caught up with us as we bottomed out onto Moxie Pond Rd. We crossed the stream, didn't end up needing to ford it, and went a few more hundred yards into the woods before stopping for lunch. Lunch raised my spirits a great deal. The humor of the past couple of days has been centered around Moxie Cola, a soda found pretty much exclusively in northern New England, which we have become obsessed with since Stratton. It's kind of polarizing in terms of taste, because it's bitter and almost like licorice. We all really like it though, and have taken to inventing different ad campaigns and commercials for Moxie, most ending with us saying in a 1920s sports announcer voice ""Moxie! It'll give ya moxie!"" With Moxie Bald approaching, these jokes were at an all-time high. We headed off from our lunch spot and made our way over to the start of the climb up Moxie. Seal Tree had his usual post-lunch burst of energy and was significantly ahead of Lightning and me until most of the way up the climb. The climb was tough, with a fair bit of switchbacking and scrambles. To make things harder, the skies began to just open up on us about halfway up. There was a bad weather bypass trail, and I don't really know what other time it would've been more appropriate to take it - it was a downpour, and we had heard lightning nearby. But we decided that the trail was for HIKERS WITHOUT MOXIE, AND WE HAD TONS OF MOXAAAYY. We took shelter under a cave about 2/3 up and regrouped, egging ourselves on, and also hoping that Goldie was alright behind us. The summit opened up to a series of parallel spines of rock, all exposed to the wind and rain. Fortunately the weather had improved mildly, but still was awful. We headed up to the cairn on the summit, only to realize we didn't know which way the trail led down. We tried a number of routes before realizing that the trail did not actually go over the summit, and we had missed a turn about a hundred yard away. Seal managed to see the cairn first and led us the right direction. The descent off of Moxie was very sketchy, a lot of bare, open, slanted granite, and I slipped a number of times. I led the group down, and was moving pretty quick though. Leader is always a wet job on these rainy days, because you end up hitting all the little trees and shaking off droplets onto yourself. I brought back a trick from the long trail and hit all the little trees with my poles before touching them to stay a little drier. My poor shorts though; they never really dry on days like this. I was very glad to finally bottom out from the descent, and we made our way the little bit to Moxie Bald Lean-to. We were hoping for an empty shelter so we could spread out and have a nice dry place to cook dinner, but unfortunately, it was already mostly full: There was one middle aged Sobo woman, and then the French flying pigs family whom I'd met in Gorham! They have been skipping around doing pieces of trail in Maine here and there, and are headed at least to Monson. Unfortunately, they take up quite a bit of room, and it looked like there would be two spots, max, in this small shelter. I was somehow able to convince my crew that I was deserving of one of them, and Lightning claimed the other spot. Seal Tree was happy to hammock anyway.Goldie showed up about 20 minutes later, looking bedraggled and depressed. I'm not sure why, but Goldie does not use a pack cover, and so her things were pretty wet by and large because of all the rain. Goldie and Lightning did a bit of haggling over who would get the spot in the shelter, with Lightning originally allowing her the spot if she would set up his hammock for him, but I believe he just went off to set it up himself in the end, leaving Goldie the spot. She looks like she needs it right now. The Sobo woman proved herself not to be particularly nice: she took up a great deal of floor and hanging space in the shelter and would not forego any part of it, and also explained how she left her hiking partner behind without really much preparation or warning. Not cool. Around 5 or so, another Sobo came in wondering if there was ""any room at the inn,"" so to speak. We told him no, unfortunately, with 7 already in a 6 person shelter. We told him with the numbers we saw today, the next shelter should be pretty empty. He bravely decided to push on over Moxie Bald, and we wished him luck. It was good to get some food in me and be in dry clothes. But today took quite a toll on my morale. Besides the rain, it's become increasingly hard to be in contact with my parents and Ali. I miss Ali dearly and really want this trip to be over as soon as it can so I can see her. She's in an incredibly stressful first semester of grad school, and I worry about my lack of communication. Fortunately, tomorrow is a chance to dry off and communicate. So those are good. Monson. The Hundred. Should be about another week on the trail. Wow.","Pierce Pond Lean-to

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551750,"Got a little better sleep last night, somewhat interrupted by our Sobo friend next to me. I think there may have been a leak in the roof, and it was crowded inside the shelter. We wanted to get as much time as we possibly could in Monson, so we were out on the trail by about 6:15, and moving quick at that. My poor shorts were still soaking wet, and are just no fun to wear. I decided that I would hike in just my compression shorts today. The trail followed the course of Moxie Bald brook as it wound down toward the East Branch of the Piscataquis River. The terrain alternated between lovely logging roads and jumbles of rocks and roots that were tough to navigate and slowed me down. We managed to rock hop a number of smaller streams listed as fords, but came up against a much harder ford at the West Branch of the Piscataquis. Goldie, Seal Tree and Lightning all wear pretty light hiking shoes, and walked right in, but I decided to take the time to fully take off my boots. No sense soaking them when they're halfway dried out from yesterday. So this created a system in which I would fall behind at the fords and then catch up with them. At the other side of the west branch, a ridgerunner that we met laid into Lightning for taking a piss about thirty feet from the river's edge. Sure, don't pee near a water source, but lady: this isn't a spring or a tiny trickle of stream. This is a thigh-deep river. Claiming that what Lightning did would have any effect on the water supply is preposterous. Plus, people are WALKING THROUGH THIS WITH THEIR BOOTS which have God knows what on them, whereas we know that urine is sterile. We know you're charged with taking care of the trail, but we're not the bad guys....The trail continued on the banks of the Piscataquis West Branch, up a fairly steep bank. It did the common AT phenomenon of climbing up and back down the bank, creating more elevation change than it really had to... just before the East Branch, five miles later, I met another ridgerunner - much older, and shoeless - who told me to make sure to stop by the visitor's center in Monson and register for Baxter State Park. The gang was snacking at the ford for the East Branch, and I went across first in order to get ahead of them. I headed up one of the only small climbs of the day, about 400 feet, passing a road that made me feel like I was back in civilization. The trail then cut along the side of a hill, and down to Lake Hebron, which had a number of docks on it, seems like a place for the locals. Just around the side, the trail diverts from its old route, which led straight through the town of Monson and instead cuts due north across Buck Hill. I moved quickly over the new-cut trail trying to catch up with the gang so I could make sure to get a hitch with them. I enjoyed the view from the top of the hill away into the 100-mile wilderness. i could definitely make out the Chairback Range that I will probably get to tomorrow. When I came out to the road, the gang was still waiting there and hadn't actually called Shaw's for a ride yet. So we did that, and soon enough a van pulled up, and the drive introduced himself as Poet, who has taken over the ownership of Shaw's for the past couple of years. And so he drove us into town, which surprised me with how large it was. It's not big by any means, but t feels significantly more like a real place than Stratton or Andover, for sure.Shaw's is in a big white farmhouse similar to the Notch Hostel, but is oder and more well-loved. It clearly caters to hikers. Within the first minute or so of being there, I was treated to a PBR from Poet. We took off all of our gear and kept it out on the porch, then went inside and all grabbed beds in a large room upstairs. This is a nicer stay than most other hostels. Reminds me most closely of Woodchuck's in Damascus. Already in the room was a woman who introduced herself as Bananas. She's been hiking since February, but seems to have been just a couple days ahead of us for a while now. She has crazy big dreds and seems nice. I told everybody I had made it safely and with its only being about 1:30, the four of us headed out to find food. We went over to the Lake Shore House, which is the other place for hikers to stay, and though we would've loved to sit inside, were seated out back because we hadn't washed the funk off ourselves yet. It was chilly out and I got a little cold. Service was also pretty damn slow, but that is often the way at these places that are basically run by a couple and a few other people. In the middle of waiting I decided to go up and visit the post office and ask about the package I tried to bump to Monson. No dice, but the lady who helped me was very nice. I'm pretty sure the package just went to the Stratton Motel as it was supposed to, rather than the post office, so nobody would've had the chance to bump it. Ive only got a week left, my shoes seem like they'll hold out. On the way back to the post office I found Wonka, who is setting up for the night at Shaw's, too. Lake shore ended up being pretty tasty, I got a big steak and cheese ""bomb"" sandwich, as well as a nice ipa. After lunch we headed to Pete's place, a coffee shop next door, where Seal Tree got a whoopie pie - he's become obsessed - and I ended up getting a milkshake. Pete's place had some resupply, but we knew that Shaw's also had some, too, and we wanted to check which was cheapest. I didn't care all that much; unlike the other folks, I had a package of food waiting for me at Shaw's courtesy of my mom, who kindly put it together for me and shipped it up! We returned to Shaw's and took showers, put on loaner clothes, did laundry, relaxed. I picked out a fetching leopard print shirt for myself. An important discovery was made that Shaw's stocks Moxie for the price of 50 cents a can. I'm pretty sure we wiped out a 12-case and a half. As usual I ended up playing a bunch of guitar, and also listened to Wonka play as well as another Sobo. This is the largest grouping of sobos I've seen since Gorham. I suppose they might congregate around trail towns because they make take zero days more frequently? That is, I'm twice as likely to see a Sobo in town as on trail? Hurm. Poet demonstrated how to play the conch shell and the didgeridoo. Wonka showed up and pitched her tent outside rather than grabbing a bunk, and then Sorority Steve showed up! I retrieved my package from the attic of the barn across the way and sorted out my food and gear. Around dinner time, Poet suggested we head to Spring Creek BBQ, which is only open on certain days of the week, and we got lucky. So Lightning, Seal Tree, Goldie, Wonka, Bananas, Steve and I headed down the block. The place looks very newly renovated, and was crowded for such a small town. I put in my order for a pulled pork sandwich and some cole slaw and got an Allagash Black stout, which I very much like. The food was up decently quick and we all sat around the end of a long table. It's carolina BBQ which isn't really my style - I prefer the syrupy thick tomatoey stuff, but maybe that makes me a tourist. It was tasty, anyways.After dinner we went over to the visitors center and checked into Baxter park; this means that now the rangers will be expecting us and have some information on us before we get there. I pored over a 3d model of katahdin, examining all the different routes up. The AT route up is quite crazy but there are other trails ten times crazier, it seems. Everything now is so Katahdin-centric. There's a hundred miles left, but it seems like there's only one mountain. I used their computer interface to register and got a little receipt that I put in my wallet. The woman who worked at the center was really nice and closed up shop as we headed out. We made our way back to Shaw's. I hung around the common area where folks were watching a movie, but also did some final chores, cleaning my water filter, folding up my tent, which i'd been drying out. I also went and checked out the hiker box, where folks leave things they don't want. It's mostly stuff I would never want - a can of bear mace, a ziploc of cheerios - but occasionally you strike gold. Shaw's was more fertile than most, and after first nabbing some chapstick and a bottle of advil, I found a brand new pair of Dirty Girl Gaiters. First of all, I don't know how you throw those out. I love mine, one of my favorite purchases on the trail, and after almost 2000 miles (I got em in hot springs) they are absolutely beat to shit. And now herre was a new pair, ready to take on the world. They were bright yellow and covered in a bee design, and would make great replacements for my busted ones, which are now about 30% hole. Lightning could not believe I had made such a find.And with that, I wrap up the last trail town on the AT. One of my favorites, really. Shaw's is a great place, and Poet is a wonderful host. Tomorrow, into the Hundred for the final push. Dear God, it's almost over. This has been my job, my life, my love for four months now. All in all, I'm incredibly happy with how I've done it. It's had its share of hardships and trials, but I don't think I'd change much of anything.","Moxie Bald Lean-to

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551751,"Thank goodness for real beds. I slept so incredibly well last night and woke up to the smell of bacon! ugh, what could be better? I did a little packing up before heading downstairs for breakfast. It's crazy how much food I have for this section. We're planning to move quickly through the hundred, but dang. It's a heck of a lot, and my pack's gonna be heeeavvyyy.Breakfast was absolutely spectacular. Easily the best homefries I've ever had, bacon, eggs, and to top it all off, blueberry pancakes. Yummmmm. The French Flying Pigs made it in for breakfast this morning and I watched AJ, one of the employees, make a cairn out of pancakes for the kids that was absolutely adorable. Seal Tree was hilariously late to breakfast and very bleary-eyed. I bet he could've slept for six more hours. His pancakes took a while, and he got antsy in his funny way. Folks went next door to make some resupply purchases from Poet's store, and I tagged along and bought some more snacks! Eventually, we were all saddled up to get going. I felt swanky in my new gaiters. I also decided that I liked hiking without my shorts so much that I would see if I could do that whole hundred without them! I did keep them around, because they're a piece of memorabilia if nothing else at this point. A bunch of us piled into the truck: Lightning, Goldie, Seal Tree, Wonka, Bananas and I all heading northbound, and three southbounders. Steve said he had pushed himself pretty hard and was looking to take a day off. Poet gave us a bit of a pep talk at the trailhead, where the 100 begins, and I felt a little bad for the Sobos to whom he jokingly just said ""you've got a long way to go."" We took a picture with the whole group, and then, we were off. A few hundred yards past the trailhead, we all took pictures with a signboard signaling the beginning of the 100 mile wilderness, which dictates that you should have 10 days worth of food. yeesh. If I had to carry that much food, it might actually take me ten days! The morning was full of very small ups and downs which passed in relative ease. Wonka and I led the group, which slowly splintered off over the course of the day. The highlights were Little Wilson Falls, which were a wonderful cascade down a big boxy rock formation, and the Big Wilson Cliffs, where Lightning and I took a short break to enjoy the view. The day was overcast but not unpleasant.Just before starting the climb up Barren Mtn. in earnest, I stopped to make one final sign on the trail. 100 miles to Katahdin. Holy shit. We rack up a hundred miles like it's nobody's business these days. I remembering the feeling of being on Albert mountain in North Carolina, that sense of incredible accomplishment, the first hard hiking, the first resupplies, getting used to the trail. It all seems impossibly long ago. Now here I was. A hundred miles to the end of my journey. I paused to get the last flowing water of the day at long Pond Stream and then began to climb Barren.The climb up was pretty brutal. Yeesh my pack is heavy. Probably the heaviest of the whole trip. As I climbed it became foggier and foggier. The trail sent me up ravines filled with roots that felt more like climbing than hiking. The trail passed two viewpoints, but I didn't stop, because it was impossibly foggy and I was getting very cold with all the damp. I climbed the second portion of the mountain and paused for a second near a dismantled fire tower at the top before continuing on. We had decided to push to nearly 20 miles today in order to set ourselves up to get to Katahdin Stream in 5 nights, but that meant staying at a pretty sub-par campsite in the form of Cloud Pond Lean-to. It is about .3 off-trail and 200 feet below it. Its water source is the stagnant pond. I'm sure it's very beautiful on a clear day, but it was foggy and cold and depressing today. I was the first to arrive of our group, and claimed a spot in a shelter that was almost full already with Sobos. One was an older man from Canada to whom I took a shine. Most were younger, just out of high school. And finally, there was a girl who had decided to set up her tent in the corner of the shelter - WHAT? I asked if she was drying it out, to which she said ""No, I'm just one of those."" Those....? People who set their tents up inside shelters? Hate to tell you, you are unique. I waited to set up any of my things because I knew they would just get damper and damper the earlier I set them out. Lightning, Seal Tree and Goldie showed up and set up their hammocks behind the shelter. I went and talked with them for a bit. Wonka also showed up and finagled a spot in the shelter next to me. It's funny how these sobos think. It's not that I don't recognize this kind of thinking, it's just that I haven't experienced it myself for months. One of them showed me his hiking poles which he'd proudly fashioned from miniature golf clubs. Fun, but they literally weigh like three pounds each. Another showed up and asked if there was any room left; we unfortunately had to deny him, and he asked one of his southbound friends (who clearly don't like him very much) if he could borrow the other's tent to set up instead of his own. No dude. No. Sorority Steve showed up! looks like he bagged on the idea of taking a day off and got shuttled out just about an hour after us. He's a positive energy to have around, always talking about the memories he's making. He does talk a lot. I had Mountain House for dinner for the first time since like Daleville VA. I decided to splurge to save on weight for this last bit. But it honestly doesn't fill me up like ramen can. Shoulda packed an extra ramen for each night to throw in or something. The final part of today was pretty exhausting. I am just itching to get to Katahdin and each impediment seems like a rebuke. It would be one thing if I could enjoy a lovely view from the tops of the mountains. But unfortunately this weather is just making the miles miles, the climbing is tough without being really redeeming. But I've got really only one more day of mountainous climbing. We're aiming for another big day tomorrow.","Shaw's, Monson, ME
",Cloud Pond Lean-to,"Jul 09, Sat",19.20
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551752,"Today might top the Carters for toughest day of hiking I've had, but that is also being compounded by my heavy pack, the terrible weather and my general emotional exhaustion with the trail. I am ready to be done. Ready. It rained more overnight, but I slept decently even though I think Wonka and I shared sleeping pads at a couple points. Wonka was gone crazy early as usual, but I was up nearly after her. Lightning and I ended up being ready to go significantly before Seal Tree and Goldie and decided to just get moving. The weather was about the same as yesterday, just a bit less blustery. Everything is damp, and it just seems like it won't dry out ever again.The first part of the day was a rollercoaster over a bunch of peaks in the Chairback range. Some of them would have had nice views, it looks like. I was less exhausted than I thought I'd be over them, but we moved pretty slow. It took us just under three hours to get to Chairback Gap Lean-to, six miles into our day. Christ. Climbing down from fourth mountain my foot slipped out from under me, and I tumbled down about ten or twelve feet of steep rocky terrain. Somehow I managed to avoid getting hurt at all, all the abuse landed on my pack, but it was an impressive fall. Lightning was right behind me, fortunately, but says that in that moment flashed through his mind the possibility that he was about to have to carry me out. It was good to have corroboration that it was an impressive fall, because it felt impressive. Thank God I'm okay.Steve caught us at the first shelter where we sat and snacked and marveled at how long this was taking us. Down off the back of Chairback (First) Mountain, we descended through a rock slide, some of the sketchiest hiking since the whites, and worse because of the weather. It was also tough to find the trail. I suppose this was what that Canadian Sobo was on about when he described the Chairbacks as ""cathedrals of rock."" Ridiculous. It was just fine. We did find a hiker taking cover from the weather under a boulder and eating lunch. We originally could not see him and it was fun having a conversation with a rock.The next bunch of miles fortunately went pretty quickly, but threw more little ups and downs at us. The weather was a little clearer at lower elevation, and the pine trees were spectacular. The trail tread was better as we passed through the border of Gulf Hagas, a canyon with very large waterfalls that we decided to pass up. We eventually came to Carl Newhall Shelter around 3, and from the voices we heard, decided to just move on the 7 more miles over the White Cap Range. This was not a little decision, however, as we had already gone a pretty full day over tough terrain. We also didn't want to leave Seal Tree and Goldie out of the loop, so we stopped in and left them a note in the log book just in case.And so began one of the most draining but satisfying sections of hiking I've done. Ahead of us were four peaks, each one pushing higher than the last, each climbing about 600 feet then falling 200. I led us onward, first up Gulf Hagas Mountain. We then descended to the Sidney Tappan Campsite, where we had been counseled to stay earlier in the day by a Sobo. It was nice, with lots of lovely tenting space. But at only a mile past the shelter, why stop here? Lightning filled up water and we moved on.West Peak was next, and the trail often felt like a staircase. On the descent of the other side, we met a southbounding couple, and when we asked the man how he was doing, he replied: ""dying."" We find this kind of stuff funny. We would get to the tops of these mountains then fall back to the gap in the ridge to see another mountain rising ahead of us. We regrouped at the top and bottom of each, motivating each other to go. God it was tough. Fortunately, the next, Hay Mountain was pretty doable, and barely registered as a summit. Then, finally, was whitecap. The trail widened out into rocky path similar to the tops of the carters in NH, but this just meant more wind and drizzle to hit us. The summit was completely exposed, with a big cairn and a lot of open rock. I was getting cold even in my coat. This is supposed to be a Nobo's first view of Katahdin, but no such luck today, not even close. I tried without luck to find cell reception. Another day of no word from me for Ali and my parents. We picked our way down through the rough rocks and headed into a fold in the mountain called Logan Gorge.It was about 6:30 at this point, and we were ready for camp. Logan Brook Lean-to fell into sight and I was disappointed to see tents already up, suggesting that the shelter was full. Which it was. And here's what gets me: it was full of people who had just taken a zero there. Yeah, a group of five sobos had decided that it was too rainy and depressing for them even to go five miles to a reasonable campsite. There are one-night-stay rules in Virginia and other places to prevent exactly this from happening; it doesn't leave equal opportunity for folks to use the amenities that the trail provides. And they seemed so self-satisfied with it, like they had outsmarted the weather. I was pretty furious with them. And unfortunately, as the person earlier today had warned us, there are precious few camping spots outside the shelter. But moving on was out of the question. We were fucking beat. I managed to find an open plot of ground between trees (and next to a cliff) exactly the size of my tent, so i set up without too much trouble. Lightning and Steve had a great deal of trouble finding spots for their hammocks, though. Unfortunately, the tenting area .1 down the trail is being used up by a maintenance crew, so pickings are very slim. Seal Tree and Goldie showed up having had just about as exhausting a day as we had. Goldie seemed especially down once again - when you don't have a pack cover, everything gets wet, and when everything gets wet, you get sad. They seemed to have less trouble finding hammock spots than lightning or steve, but maybe they were just more willing to compromise. I made dinner on the deck of the shelter as the sobos sat there in the dark. I was even more annoyed to learn that two of these guys have flip flopped from Harper's, and should know better. I didn't say anything because it couldn't change anything, but damn. I really resented that. The one ray of sunshine right now is that because we did huge miles today, we can make it to a place that would be a nice recovery for us tomorrow: White House Landing, a hostel in the middle of the 100 accessible via a side trail and speedboat ride. The prospect of a bed cheered us for tomorrow.","Cloud Pond Lean-to
",Logan Brook Lean-to,"Jul 10, Sun",23.90
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551810,"It was a pretty poor night for everyone in the crew. Rain kept waking me up and I just felt damp in the morning. Apparently a tree shifted and Goldie's hammock basically ended up on the ground, I think she ended up coming up to Lightning's hammock and squeezing in with him for the rest of the night. We all looked tired getting set up this morning. After a few morning showers, the sun came out. it looked like we would have a nice day for the first time through the hundred. We broke camp decently early and started moving very fast, which didn't stop all day. We were excited by the weather and kept up a good pace. The trail was finally what I expected from the flat sections of the hundred, pretty wide and well-graded for the most part. We had one tiny climb up little boardman mountain where we paused because there was somehow cell service. I sent a text to my parents and Ali just to tell them that I'm alright. This lack of communication is starting to get to me, I really just want to talk to Ali. The other thing that changed today is the bugs. Since it's no longer frigid and rainy, they were out in full force, and I found myself constantly swatting away deerflies and mosquitoes, and they surrounded me whenever I stopped. Another reason just to keep walking. The trail mainly followed the route of Cooper Brook on a slight descent for most of the day, and the trail changed between sections of flat open terrain to very rocky, rooty and muddy, and long sections of puncheon boardwalk.I suppose one of the more surprising aspects of the hundred is that it feels less remote than many sections of the trail. Especially now that we've done the climbing over the only peaks, there are many logging access roads and sections of clearcut that we pass. Frankly a lot of the south felt more, well, wild. I spent much of the day just behind Seal Tree, Goldie, Lightning and Sorority Steve. They were moving crazy quick, and I would fall behind to ford a river or relieve myself and would not see them for an hour. I caught up with them at lunch, which was at some unnamed part of the trail. They then caught up with me at Mud Brook, where I sat out on the beaver dam to have a snack - really this was the only respite from the bugs, which are pretty horrendous. Seal Tree especially is getting fed up with them, and smacks around his head and makes noises that sound like ""Raggum fraggum"" a good deal. We all hung out at a beach on Jo Mary Lake before the last small climb of the day up an arm of Potaywadjo ridge. We skipped rocks and took our boots off. We had 22 miles under our belts and it was only 2 oclock. We were very happy with the time we were making but m feet were starting to get pretty sore. I even put my feet in the water, which is not something I usually do, because I like to keep them pretty dry. The climb was barely a climb, and Lightning and I stopped on the other side to take a drink out of Potaywadjo Spring, a beautiful artesian well spring where you can see the water bubbling up from the ground. The cool water helped me over the last couple of miles.A few miles later, Seal Tree caught up with us, but we were immediately sidetracked to a view on the edge of Pemadumcook Lake, which we followed to a rocky shoreline. And there, in the distance, was Katahdin. This was an amazing view of it - Its bulk just hangs above the surrounding area, so much higher than the lake and the trees near us. It is hugely imposing, its giant alpine zone gray and bleak on top of the green base. We stood in awe and laughter for a while just staring at it, knowing we only had a few days until we would stand atop it ourselves. We were a little jealous of the people who get to summit today - it's gorgeous out, and they're calling for much worse weather in the next couple of days. Hopefully I get some views and don't have to wait around in Millinocket to summit or something.It was then only a few miles to the trail turnoff we had all been waiting for, the Mahar Tote Trail. Lightning and I got there first and decided to leave Jan, a little plastic cutout of a woman's face from Lightning's toyota dealership, at the turnoff, to tell everybody else to come this way. The signage was a little abstruse, but we found our way to the edge of a pond with a dock, following the signs for White House Landing. They no longer have the airhorn signaling system, instead asking you to call them on their phone for pickup. We all have AT&T or Sprint, though, and we waited for Goldie, who has Verizon, which has had consistently better service in the 100. (A word for prospective hikers: Cell service is never a huge issue, but Verizon has consistently better service in the south and slightly better in Maine. The only time AT&T wins is NY & CT).Goldie eventually rolled up and had no trouble placing a call, and soon we heard the sounds of a speedboat coming across the water. The owner, Bill, introduced himself and said he could take three of us. Goldie, Seal Tree and Steve hopped in and Lightning and I hung around skipping rocks. Jim was back to find us in just a few minutes, so we piled in with our stuff. He knows the rocks in the lake like the back of his hand, and it was fun to be moving so fast with the wind in our faces. I did get the unfortunate spot in the boat in that all the spray was hitting me the whole time, so I arrived pretty damp at the dock to White House Landing, which is a series of a few cabins along the beautiful shoreline of Pemadumcook Lake. The place is apparently reopen this year after some renovations, and it looks pretty great. We set all of our stuff down outside on some benches and began to dry out the objects that had gotten unacceptably wet over the last couple of days. We were also given a small tour of the place, and set up the rest of our things in the bunkhouse, which is very comfortable and has actual gas-fed lighting that looks straight out of the 19th century. We bought a bunch of baked goods to tide us over til dinner. Zucchini bread was especially tasty, and Lightning and I both bought little loaves of it. Their shower system seems simplistic but was actually incredibly hot and lovely. This was such a needed break from the drudgery of the last couple of days. It is also a needed break because we realized that we are all running out of food faster than we thought we would; we all made compromises on our food bags leaving Monson because we knew we couldn't carry such a crazy large amount of food. But I am eating more in this section than I have the whole way, I feel like, and having now a dinner and a breakfast that I can buy is a huge boon. They do have some resupply food, but it's very minimal and pricey. The whole place is pricey, but hey, its the hundred mile wilderness. Things are hard to come by. We spent a great deal of time sitting on the porch of the main cabin, which reminds me of a cleaner version of Harrison's, but with a similar feel with antlers on the walls, and lots of old signs and photos. We played with their dog, throwing it a deflated basketball all over the campus. Eventually, dinner opened up, and we tried to get seated first, because we had heard that service can be slow (since the kitchen staff is just Bill and his wife). I got a big ol burger while some other folks got pizza. Seal Tree, who got a burger too, and I were considering splitting another pizza, but the fullness kicked in before I could put in the order, and it ended up just being Seal Tree's pizza. Leftovers!The evening was spent sitting out enjoying the sunshine on the grass and chilling inside the bunkhouse, which has some very comfy couches. Tomorrow we'll grab breakfast here before our last full day in the hundred!","Logan Brook Lean-to
",White House Landing via Mahar Tote Trail,"Jul 11, Mon",25.70
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551813,"I ended up moving off of the spring mattress in the bunkhouse to the extremely comfy couch. I was very happy about the decision and slept very nicely. I also was up pretty early thanks to our early sleep time, and couldn't fall back, so I just decided to get up. I packed up some of my stuff and milled about while folks got ready for breakfast. Breakfast was pretty darn tasty, with eggs and bacon and pancakes. We all wanted more though, and it took a while to come out because Bill hadn't anticipated we'd be as hungry as we were. After breakfast we all settled up and got ready to go. It looked like we were going to be in two waves again, and although I was supposed to go in the second one, I ended up being bumped to the first because one of the sobos was taking too long. so I hopped in with Goldie and Seal Tree and managed not to get the spray seat this time. We leapfrogged all morning with some older guys who had stayed the night at White House Landing, one of whom gave us kind of a weird speech before handing us gift cards to Adidas, who are sponsoring his hike. The trail moved along the side of Nahmakanta Stream, walking a somewhat circuitous route over blowdowns and streams. We passed through a state camping area near the shore of Nahmakanta Lake, where we took a long sit to enjoy the pretty morning. These breaks in the mornings are not really my style, but I like to hang out and skip rocks with the folks. The trail continued around the edge of the Lake, but ended up climbing up and over some little rises only to go back down to the edge. i guess the trail below has been prone to flooding. The only real climb of the day came at Nesuntabunt mountain, which involved a lot of moving in and out of rock staircases and formations. It was actually pretty hard. We took the small side trail to the vista near the top and sat down for lunch at an outcropping with great views down to the lake and up to Katahdin. We are on a different side of the mountain now, and can see the north-south expansion of it. It's really a big big plateau, the most impressive view of which is from the south. Steve enjoyed his leftover pizza from WHL, we witnessed feuding chipmunks, and a large group of highschoolers came up and forced us out of our spot. So we kept moving. The trail climbed down along the route of pollywog stream (there's a pattern here isn't there.) and I heard the waterfall at Pollywog gorge. The trail then began hiking back up along the route of Rainbow Stream, which fell down through a narrow sluiceway for miles, and was incredibly gorgeous. I eventually came to Rainbow Stream Lean-to, which is perched right above the raging stream, and was amazed to find Wonka and Bananas! So the story was that on the day we headed over Whitecap to Logan Brook, they had stayed at the previous shelter, and ended up doing a 30 mile day yesterday and camped near Potaywadjo shelter. They had gotten an earlier start than us and now we were back together. Lightning seems to be at his wit's end, and as much as I'm done with the hundred mile wilderness, he is far more. He told us he was considering just hiking to Abol bridge tonight just to be done with it, which would be a 30 mile day. I tried to convince him he was crazy, but he was determined. But before he could get going to leave, the skies suddenly opened up. And so the seven of us hunkered down inside the little shelter to wait for the rain to pass. Which it mostly did. But wow, we haven't had a fully dry day yet here in the hundred. This is easily the wettest section I've had since Pennsylvania. Lightning then sped off down the trail ahead of us. The rest of us took our time more. The four miles to Rainbow Spring were surprisingly difficult despite being basically flat - they were covered in mud and rocks and slow going. I ended up slipping a couple times and landing my knee in mud. They were emotionally exhausting even more, I just wanted to be done for the day. We also passed a young group of kids and their leaders from Chewonki, a camp in Maine very similar to my own Keewaydin. Lightning's pervasive done-ness is pretty present in all of us, but just kind of exploding out of him and bubbling beneath the surface for all of us. Damn these bugs. We found Lightning just before Rainbow Spring, having decided that it would be crazy to hiking ten more miles. I was very happy to see him at least. Rainbow Spring is a pretty decent campsite, with a good number of flat spaces for tents, even a privy, and a lovely piped spring that comes out right next to the water. i set up my tent at one of the upper pads, near steve's hammock. Lightning is closer to the water. It's one of my only nights with large numbers of other folks at a campsite rather than a shelter. We all ate dinner down by the water and enjoyed the sunset. The bugs were better than up by the tents, but still are not great. It sucks: They are making this section significantly less enjoyable. It was nice feeling like a had a real trail family, though. So much of this trip, especially this bit before Stratton, was very lonely for me, and I had felt i missed out on a large part of trail culture. So I'm glad to be surrounded by friends in these last miles.Tomorrow, into Baxter!","White House Landing via Mahar Tote Trail
",Rainbow Spring Campsite,"Jul 12, Tue",19.50
Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552045,"The gang was incredibly amped to get out of the Hundred and into Baxter as soon as possible this morning, so we were up very early. Wonka was long gone, as usual, and most of the others were packing up as I rolled out of bed. I tried to move quickly, but everybody else had a pretty good head start. Other hikers and groups of hikers probably use the hundred as a way to slow down and remember the trail as best they can, but, honestly, we are all pretty ready to get out. Maine, despite its beauty, has not been my favorite part of the trail (which it is for most people). A lot of this feeling has to do with the rain and the bugs we've endured over the last week or two, the experience overall has just been less enjoyable. We can't wait to finish.We also wanted to get out because we're pretty much out of food. I have more than most folks because of the package that my mom sent me in Monson, but everybody else really went pretty light on the resupply from Shaw's because it was pretty marked up and not a very diverse selection. Even the stop at White House Landing meant not that we had extra meals, but that we could eat more at the existing meals. I think Seal Tree ate his last granola bar this morning. The trail headed along the side of Rainbow Lake for three miles or so before beginning a gentle climb up to the rainbow ledges, which looked like a lower elevation version of the ledges I'd seen in Northern NH and the Bigelows, big open faces of granite and sparse trees. I moved very quickly over them, attempting to catch up with the gang before we got to Abol. I stopped and chatted with a Sobo mother and daughter for a second at one pretty spectacular view of Katahdin. It's funny how you see so many pictures of the end of the trail, so you imagine it'll take you forever to get to Katahdin once you see it, but really, it's only three days. I descended down to Hurd Brook Lean-to, where, after navigating the river via rocks, I sat on the shelter floor and entered my last log book entry of the trail. It's so crazy to think that you could follow me all the way up from Georgia via these things. I've been more diligent about log book entries than most; I love seeing everybody else singing in on the trail. Seal Tree - who was just ahead of me - had been very excited to get to this lean-to because the AWOL guide said it had a ""baseball bat floor,"" which he thought meant it was actually mad from baseball bats. It just means it's uncomfortable rods instead of planks. I cruised over the last 3 miles from Hurd Brook Lean-to to the edge of the Hundred Mile Wilderness. Just before the entrance to Golden Road, I came across a guy without a backpack wearing a St. Louis Blues shirt walking southbound, who looked familiar. He asked me if I knew a guy named Aaron, or Lightning, and I quickly realized he must be Lightning's brother, Evan! I told him they were still ahead of me, and so he turned around and we walked and chatted together out onto Golden Road, the end of the Hundred! Yahoo! Evan hopped back in a car with Lightning's mom, and they drove off towards Abol Bridge Campground. They offered me a ride, but I told them that I needed to walk this section. The day was hot and sunny, and I walked happily out along the dirt road, grateful even for the power lines in the distance. It was good to be here. It was only about 9:45 in the morning, we had made good time. I walked over Abol bridge and was met with the postcard picture view of Katahdin in all its glory. It is truly an immense mountain, and just dominates the entire horizon. (We're only at about 500 ft of elevation looking up at it here). I found Wonka, Lightning, Steve, Goldie and Seal Tree all out under the awning of the Abol Bridge Campground Store. Lightning's mom and brother were out of the car and handed every sausage mc muffins. Most people were already polishing off a first round of ice cream from the store. We only had ten miles to go in the day, so we decided that hanging around for a while would not be a problem. I bought a little bit of resupply and some celebratory finish-the-hundred beers. The restaurant did not open until noon, so we ended up hanging out down by the Penobscot River, where we sat on a bench and swatted at bugs while we ate some of the immense amount of snacks that the Winenengers brought to share. Among them were bing cherries, which I love; you really miss fresh fruit on the trail. We took some happy photos and then went inside to eat some food.Wonka headed out, and the rest of us grabbed a table in the corner and got lunch, which Mrs. Winenger generously offered to purchase. We were all pretty tired, and Seal Tree ended up falling asleep in his chair. This place unfortunately does not let you recharge phones since they have to generate all their own power. Lord knows I haven't been able to send a text in days. After lunch, we slowly rallied ourselves to get going. The day had become pretty oppressively hot, but we said goodbye and thank you to the Winengers and walked out onto the road, which we followed until turning left back onto the trail and into Baxter state park. There was a little kiosk on which we signed up for spots at the Birches shelter for the night, where Long-distance hikers stay before climbing up Katahdin. The trail followed along the side of the Penobscot River, very flat, open pine needle type walking, very well-maintained, About four miles into Baxter, we stopped off at what is known as Pine Point, where the trail border on a large rock slab out in the Nesowadnehunk River. We put our packs down and stripped clothing off, deciding to beat the heat with a dip in the river. We fooled around, playing with the currents and eddies, and enjoying the fresh clean water after all those days in the Hundred. I had seen videos of people sliding down the rock here, but decided it was ill-advised because the water was lower. We dried out by laying on the rock, but decided to start moving because of the flies. The next 6 miles were surprisingly taxing, as usual because i just wanted to get somewhere, that place being KSC. The terrain grew more difficult, with slight uphills and loots of rooty footing. These two hours took forever. At least the day was dry, as opposed to every day in the Hundred. We passed a parking area that began to remind me of the state parks-type hiking that we did in pennsylvania. We then passed some ponds, slowly rising in elevation until, with relief, we hit Lily Bay Road and followed the trail into Katahdin Stream Campground. The campground is more immense than I imagined it would be, with tons of lean-to structures and tent pads and room for car parks. I spose there's tons of people who want to climb Katahdin on any given day. After a bit of confusion on where to go, we headed up on the paved path, following signs for the summit, until turning off across Katahdin Stream and towards the Ranger Station. Wonka was walking down to the station from the other direction, having already dropped her stuff at the shelter for the night. We all waited inside the covered front porch of the Station for the ranger to return, which he did in just a few minutes. One by one we went inside his office and registered to be in the park and hike Katahdin the next day. I was Nobo number 73 from Springer! I was 104 at Harper's, not bad for someone who took an entire week off in NJ. The ranger then gave us all a run-down of what to expect from tomorrow. He suggested a pretty early start (which is what we were planning anyway, since there's storms predicted for the afternoon). We told him that we wanted to do Knife's Edge, which meant that it would not make sense to hike back to KSC, as most folks do. He suggested taking day packs from KSC and finding some hiker who would be willing to drive our packs over to a different campground, strongly suggesting we not bring packs, saying it could take us 12 hours to go from KSC across knife edge down to Roaring Fork even without packs. We thought this sounded like a pretty gross exaggeration, but it did give us some serious pause.I filtered some water from Katahdin Stream, then we made our way over .3 to the Birches Shelters, which were surprisingly pretty grim. They lack the same soul that a lot of trail shelters have - no random nails and strings hanging down, no graffitti. I decided once again to sleep in my tent so as not to get chewed by the bugs. Bananas did not show up through the evening, she may have headed off to millinocket from abol or something. We had a good time hanging out and making jokes through the evening. Looks like all of us are still planning on doing Knife's Edge with our packs. People have done it before, we decided, and this is what we trained for. In my tent, right before going to bed, I decided to finally pull out Ali's note, which she had written ""for a day when I really needed it."" It was inspiring and sweet, and also included a picture of the two of us, which made me feel somewhat like a WWII soldier, carrying around a picture of his sweetheart back home. I've had pretty low days when this might've been appropriate to read - Big Firescald Knob, Bromley, even yesterday - but the idea of finally opening it the night before summiting Katahdin was too persuasive. It's nice to read it now, when communication has been harder than ever, and I will finally be able to talk with her again soon.I can't believe this is finally it. A few more miles, and it'll be done.","Rainbow Spring Campsite

Portage,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552545,"We broke camp around 6 this morning to give ourselves some extra time. There wasn't much sleep for me last night. It's all just coming to the end. There's too much to think about, too many emotions. But really it sort of felt like another day on the trail, another crazy climb ahead of us. Wonka had headed out long ago, preparing to finish the trail like she spent most of it, alone. Still no sign of Bananas. But Lightning, Steve, Seal Tree, Goldie and I headed out all together back to the campground with everything still on our back, excited for our last day of hiking. The trail is better worn than just about anywhere in Maine, but it's no joke: Katahdin proved itself to be the scrambliest, toughest climb on the entire trail. The gravel path of the campground turned into the woods, and began to climb through classic Maine evergreens and rock spurs. We passed a father and son around Katahdin Stream Falls, but other than that, we were essentially alone. We were moving incredibly quickly, fueled by adrenaline. The day was overcast and the summit of the mountain was completely clouded over. We hoped it would burn off as the day wore on. The whole trail felt sort of like a ditch dug into the side of the mountain; we were surrounded by rocks and trees on both sides. Slowly we began to climb more consistently up boulders and roots, the pitches of climbing became steeper and steeper as the trees began to thin. Soon we were hauling ourselves up ledges. The few views we had, of the Owl, a neighboring mountain, were foggy and misty. The Hunt Trail truly gets crazy. Multiple sections felt pretty death-defying as we clambered our way up and over big faces and out on skinny ledges. Iron bars helped in a few places, but they were less like ladders and more like pegs that occasionally were useful. Lightning's mother and brother had been planning on climbing up Katahdin right behind us (although lightning elected to climb with us rather than them), and he worried they wouldn't make it up. The white blazes would just kind of appear and we'd go ""Huh? We have to get There?"" I was leading the group, being the guinea pig for different routes up the scrambles. We were making good time, though. By 8, we hit the Hunt Spur, a small flat section of trail between two areas of pretty technical climbing. We finally entered the fog, and visibility became pretty much zero. No views off the Hunt Spur for us today. I pulled ahead of the group, powering up the climb, which was steeper than the earlier climbing but had fewer technical jumps. I sat down as I reached the Gateway, where the tough climbing ends as you enter the Tablelands, the flat plateau on top of Katahdin. I took a drink and waited for Seal Tree and Steve to catch up. We cruised over the flat land between us and Thoreau Spring, where I filtered a little water. The wind was blowing and it was spitting and misty out, but we weren't stopping for anything long. It was decently warm out, too. From the spring to the top of the mountain was the last mile of the entire trail. Holy shit. After four months of waiting and working, there was only one mile between me and the end, between me and being a 2000-miler, a thru-hiker. For the last four months, the entirety of my life had been measured out in miles. I know I can make three miles an hour on level ground, that I can walk 20 miles a day for weeks, that the last mile of the day is always the toughest, but it'll be done in 20 minutes as long as I keep moving. And this was it. The last mile. The trail was roped in to preserve the alpine zone, similar to Mt. Mansfield in Vermont, where I've hiked many times. It sloped gently up towards the summit, getting slightly steeper the whole time. We were basically jogging. I was in the lead.Then it came into view. The sign I'd been waiting to see in person for two years: KATAHDIN. The culmination of everything I'd worked for and been for the last four months. The balds of Tennessee, the hot days in Virginia, the rocky ridges of Pennsylvania, the slogging mud in New England, the sweaty climbs of New Hampshire, all of it had led me up to this moment. I walked over to the sign and laid down on it, face first. There was some mild applause from the other folks who were up there, a group from a girl's camp nearby. The order of the moment was, of course, pictures. We wouldn't get a view off the top today. Apparently you have to be quite lucky to at this time of year. But I liked the rough gray backdrop, all the more rugged. Seal Tree got up on the sign first, then me, then Steve, who took out a hawaiian shirt and a snapple he had been saving for this moment. It felt so good to stand on top of the world there. This was it. Goldie came up a few minutes later, and we cheered her as she approached and gave the sign a big kiss. We all sat around on the summit. It was 9 oclock, we were making great time. The ranger had given us some very overblown estimates. I spose that's his job, but still. Not good estimates for us as hikers. There was a large raven hopping around the sign, which was strangely morbid. I called my mom and tried to call ali. A message got through to her. It's funny saying ""It's over."" There's no denying it's a special summit, though. The next few minutes were filled with discussion. We all had planned on doing the Knife's Edge, but Lightning was having second thoughts, in that he wanted to wait for his mother and brother to arrive and summit with him. We told him that he needed to make this decision himself. Eventually, he decided that he would just descend back down the hunt trail until he found his brother. Then, he would climb back up to the top, then find his mother, and they would drive home to St. Louis. This was Lightning's goodbye, then, to all of us. Lightning is a defining character of my thru hike: I spent longer with him probably than any other single hiker. We are compatible in speed and temperament, and I've had just an amazing time hiking and joking and tripping with him. We started the same day, and met on the second day of both of our trips, and here we were together atop Katahdin. I remember pointing out we had matching packs on day 2, to sitting together on the tinker cliffs in Virginia to finally meeting up in Stratton. Wow. I can't even imagine what it's like for Seal Tree, who's been with him since new york, and Goldie, who have seen each other every moment of the day since Harper's Ferry. It's crazy how trail families work. Every conversation we have had revolves around meeting people, who we've seen, when was the last time we saw so and so. This trail has united us and brought us together for these fleeting moments, the memories of the people inextricable from the trail we've walked on. And then, they're gone forever, down into the mist.The other four of us paused another moment at the summit and took a few parting photos before heading off. It was 10 now, we'd spent an hour on the summit. We decided Knife's Edge was the only proper way to complete a thru-hike, so we headed off along the narrow, rocky ridge, with the wind blowing and the world falling away from us on both sides. The clouds were flying up from the southern ridge to our right. The rocks were reminiscent of the ones up the side trails to the Presidential range, large and boxy, requiring pretty big steps. I thanked the powers that be that it wasn't raining. As we descended, the skies began to clear. There were a few moments at which the clouds would part from the ridge and we could see away back to the mountain's bumps we'd already climbed over. Then, like day and night, we exited the cloud layer, and the rest of the Knife's Edge sprawled out before us. Holy Hell, what have we gotten ourselves into. The ridge curled out and away like a dragon's back, nothing but sheer rock to either side of us. We were on a narrow corridor of flat rock that swung along the ridge, curving up and over all the bumps and ravines. Suddenly, we could see away to the surrounding ponds and lakes, and down to Chimney pond, impossibly far below just on the northern side of the mountain. We kept moving. The Knife's Edge was absolutely the most spectacular part of this entire hike, and unlike anything I've ever done. I'm so happy to have added it on to the end of this trek. The trail went over narrow ledges skirting summits, and up two-foot wide slabs of rock, the only way to move forward between the cliffs. Katahdin is perhaps the most spectacular mountain I've ever been on, with huge sloping faces of granite just sliding down thousands of feet. I'm so glad the trail ends here. The clouds slowly cleared away from the summit of the mountain. We were not too envious, we would've had to wait another hour to get views from the top, and we would've been too cold. Plus, we were getting the views now from the Knife Edge. Baxter really is something special. There was one bad scramble coming down from Chimney peak to a col between Chimney peak and Pamola, the final hump on the Knife Edge. It involves a short sheer drop, but we all made it down fine. Seal Tree Steve and I hung out in the col and ate some food, waiting up for Goldie, who is a little more careful on the crazy rocks. We watched a number of people struggle with the scramble going uphill and tried to yell advice. It was truly lovely down here in the col, out of the wind, enjoying the sun and the tremendous views. This was the first moment I looked back and thought about how I really did it, how we weren't just climbing down to some road crossing to resupply, that we were heading down to leave the trail, to go home. Goldie was held up by the people going up and she came down the drop. But she is literally a climbing instructor at home, so she had no trouble (although when we told her to throw her poles down, she basically threw one off the mountain, and I went to fetch it for her downhill). We sat for a while longer than headed up to Pamola, named for a native deity thought to live up here. The Knife edge was behind us, all the craziest parts of Katahdin and the trail now done. Now it was a long descent off the top of the mountain. We took the Helon Taylor trail down. It is amazing just how much vertical climb there is up Katahdin. This descent took for ever, even longer than off of Madison or anywhere like that. It also began to kill on my knees, and also my palms, which I consistently used to push off of boulders as I descended. I had heard some people climb Katahdin with gloves on. I hadn't stopped to realize that this is for the descent, not the climb. The views away into the wilderness were astonishing. Eventually, we came back under treeline. There were some difficult scrambles, but none that would've been as hard as going back down the hunt trail. I paced with Seal Tree through the woods, stopping for a bit by a lovely brook, where I filled up some water, which we'd been without since Thoreau Spring. Once again I had the feeling of the trail taking longer than I thought it would, but this time, I felt like I truly didn't want it to end. I wanted to stay in these woods, to spend more days with these people. But I also was excited to get out. We hit the Chimney Pond trail and headed along the flat ground and into a parking lot. For a while Seal Tree and I just sat and waited in the sun, talking, snacking. We were headed into Millinocket, and we'd been told that it would not be hard to find rides there. Steve and Goldie showed up pretty soon. The parking lot was pretty empty, not really anyone milling about, so we sat for quite a while. We thought we might catch a ride with some big groups of what looked like students, but they were just moving to another part of the park. Goldie, though, on the way back from the privy, struck up a conversation with two women who were headed back into millinocket, and agreed to take all four of us! We would crowd in the backseat of the car, but we really didn't care. They also had some extra granola bars and baked goods that they sort of threw on us; we couldn't have been happier. It was about an hour's drive into millinocket, and they took us all the way, congratulating us on finishing. They dropped us off right in front of the Appalachian Trail Café. First things first: food. This was one of my absolute favorite food stops on the whole trail. Everyone ended up getting fried ice cream, which actually came out before our meals. I got a generous and super tasty burger. Some nasty kids were rude to our server, so I made sure to give her a big tip. She was very sweet and told us to make sure to sign the ceiling tile that was in the corner, a tradition for AT hikers. The whole ceiling was covered in signatures from past hikers. Next, we walked over to the appalachian trail lodge, an AT hostel in Millinocket. On the way, we met up with Seal Tree's mother and cousins, who had come to meet him and take him back home! I can very much see where Seal Tree comes from from his mother, who was very sweet. They had all been planning on staying at the AT lodge, and when we got there, the owner OleMan (downright rudely) informed us that they were full up for the night.In a very generous move, Seal Tree's mother and cousins decided to forego their spots in the hostel and go find a hotel, and would not hear of having us reimburse them. I'm guessing that their decision was made easier by the fact that the hostel was not exactly what they were looking for in terms of stay. So they all went off to find a room and we moved our stuff up to the top floor of the hostel, which is pretty minimal but in a big house. I took a short nap and then a shower. The Ballmans had brought up a huge spread from the deli where Seal Tree works at home, and invited us all to have sandwiches down outside the hostel. We thanked them all very much as we devoured the cold cuts and Italian-style condiments. We ended up walking over to an ice cream truck on the green and hanging out before saying goodnight to the Ballmans. Tomorrow, I will grab a ride with Steve from a section hiker named Forecast to Bangor, where we then will catch a bus to Portland. Steve will hang out in Portland for a couple days, but I will meet up with my parents, who are visiting our friends the Stetsons who live very nearby on a beautiful lake.I'm a thru-hiker. I did it.","The Birches, Katahdin Stream Campground
