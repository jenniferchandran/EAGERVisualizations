Tetris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/509193,"Hello everyone, my name is Bryant.March 2016 I will begin my Appalachian Trail thru hike! I have been completely obsessed with the AT over the past few months. Before this obsession with the AT I had only been on one overnight backpacking trip, which I took in 2006 with one of my best friends, Eric, who successfully thru hiked the AT in 2012 with the trail name ""Bomber"". We hiked Mt. Marshall in the Adirondacks. I never gave any thought to the AT in the past. Even when my friend Eric was on his thru hike I just thought, ""you are absolutely crazy"". But now I understand, it is not a feeling you can shake, it is a feeling that overtakes you, and you know you just NEED to do this. I got that feeling in May and it keeps growing.Since getting this idea back in May, I have gone on a couple trips on the AT, and have loved every second of it. I am currently training for the trail by going on overnight trips on the weekends. I will post a tentative gear list within the next couple weeks.Thanks for reading. I look forward to updating everyone on my progress.- Bryant",,View Entry,"Aug 09, Sun",0
Tetris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511420,"Hello everyone!Below I have A gear List, though It is not entirely complete. I have weighed every item I plan on taking. I will be buying some items to replace/upgrade what is on this list. A few of the items I plan on getting are the the ENO Sub 7 hammock and Helios straps, as well as a down jacket, cold weather sleeping bag, and a lighter pot set. I am currently planning a trip to the Adirondacks in September where Eric(""Bomber"", from here on out) and I will be hiking 7 of the high peaks. I just ordered ""AWOL on the Appalachian Trail"" and am very excited to start reading it. Although this gear list is going to change, I wanted to post it so we can see the progression from now to the time I get on the AT.

Tetris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514984,"Last Week I went to the Adirondacks with Bomber. We hiked up 9 of the high peaks in 3 days. We started at the Adirondack Loj, where we had to get Bear Canisters. Neither of us where happy about adding a couple extra pounds to our packs for the canister, but it is required for the High Peaks Wilderness.The first day we hiked up Wright Peak(4,580 ft), which has debris from a B-47 Bomber plane crash near the summit. then, we hiked up to Algonquin(5114 ft) and Iroquois(4,840 ft) before taking a steep decent down to Lake Colden, where we hung out Hammocks for the night.We woke up and hit the trail around 7:15am to begin our accent up Mt. Colden(4,714 ft) while eating a delicious danish. once at the Summit of Colden we dried out our gear, then headed down the opposite side we came. I left my pack at the Feldspar Lean To, then slack packed Cliff Mtn(3,960 ft) which had some of the steepest sections of the entire trip...and no view. After Cliff, we got on the trail for Redfield(4,606 ft), which follows a river up most of the way. The second night we camped in the Lean To. Day 3 we started with Gray(4,840 ft) then went to Skylight(4,920 ft). Skylight was my favorite of the trip. When hiking up Skylight you are suppose to carry a rock up and place it at the summit for good weather. From Skylight we ascended to the highest point in New York, Mt Marcy(5,344 ft). Once we where done enjoying the beautiful views from Marcy, we hiked 7 miles back to the Adirondack Loj.",,The Adirondacks,"Oct 01, Thu",0

His name was Thor, that is his real name, not a trail name. We invited him in and talked for a few hours while I drank water and they drank all the beer. Thor had thru hiked The A.T. in 1999, and has thru hiked The P.C.T. twice. He just noticed some hikers were staying in the cabin next to his and decided to give us some trail magic.Today, we took it slow because there were so many great views. First we went back to Mountain Crossings at Neels Gap to eat breakfast. 6 miles into the day we had some more trail magic. A couple of guys had pop, chips, candy, and little Debbie snacks for us.

I believe the store was called ""Ingles"" with a huge sign on the front of the building that read ""Made in America"". We are figuring it will take about 6 days to get to Franklin, where we can resupply again. I bought way to much food, I was trying to get everything to fit in my pack. I was joking around that I need to get better at Tetris so I can pack my bag better...and that is when I was given the trail name ""Tetris"".As we were all sitting at the side of the building a women named Lori asked if we needed a ride anywhere, we jumped up and said we needed to get to Unicoi Gap. She drove us 11 miles back to the trail. When we got to the parking lot there was more trail magic waiting for us. A couple of section hikers had hot dogs, banannas, and Gatorade for us. We ate and drank a few of each. While eating in the parking lot we got to meet Miss Janet, who is a popular trail angel. She follows those attempting a thru hike from Georgia to Maine.

Then I climbed up Wesser Bald, which had a tower on the summit with beautiful 360° views. I met Bear claw on top of the tower. We called the N.O.C. to reserve a couple beds at the Hostel. I showered, resupplied and ate a cheeseburger with pesto. I am currently eating a pint of ""Road Runner Raspberry"" ice cream.Robb asked about my shelter system. I have a ENO Sub7 hammock with ENO Helios straps, and a ENO Profly Tarp. I do not use an underquilt. Instead, I use a Therm-a-rest Neo-Air pad, which does a great job at reflecting body heat to help keep me warm. My sleeping bag is a Sierra Designs Mobile Mummy, which is rated for 29°f, along with a thermal liner that adds about 15° of warmth, and a silk liner that I use mainly to keep my sleeping bag clean. Last night it got down to the high 20s and I stayed warm. I will need to get a new hammock though because the Sub7 is not wide enough to get a good diagonal lay.

I met some guys there that just created a wrap they called ""Bear Bag Cake"". Naturally, I had to try it. It consists of a tortilla with butter, nutella, peanut butter, and honey. This thing was glorious, it would be little Debbie's best selling item. The climb out of Stecoah Gap was not fun, it was a 600 foot climb in .6 miles nicknamed ""Jacob's Ladder"".

Tetris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547452,"I had a couple pancakes at the cabin this morning. Blade and Bad Apple where at the first shelter I passed. I had not seen them since NY. The 3 of us and Joy Ride decided to all go to Dalton, MA tonight. Our first plan was to set up camp at the house of Trail Angel, Tom Lavardi. When we got to his place in town we could not stay there because it was already way too full of hikers. We did see one SOBO (Southbounder) hiker at the house who had just bought a goat and was planning to hike the rest of the trail with it. This seems to me like a very stupid thing to do.We left Tom Lavardi's and tried to find a good spot to stealth camp in town. We seemed to have found a good wooded spot behind a couple restaurants, but we were not going to set up until it got dark.The 4 of us ate at Paddy's Restaurant. The owner sat down with us for a few minutes to talk and gave us a discount on our meal. Wild Hair, Buckeye, and Little Bear walked in a few minutes later. Once Paddy's closed the 7 of us went to Jacob's Pub. We all stayed there till closing time, 1am. The 7 of us went back to our previously scouted stealth camping spot, Little Bear and I being the only sober ones. Everyone but us two were making a huge ruckus and flashing their headlamps all around. It took the cops 5 minutes to show up and tell us to camp elsewhere...so we all split a couple motel rooms.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin
