Grace,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/440410,"This is my first journal entry, I plan to leave Springer on 4/08/16 Florida girl need the warmer weather. Most of my family and friends are pretty certian I have completely ""lost it"". I have wanted to do this for 20 years and now that my three daughters are grown and I am able to retire from a career that I have enjoyed (for the mostpart), it is my time to go. I feel that ""VERY STRONG CALLING"" to the trail which cannot be explained. I know that there are many of us, we are truly blessed. Or maybe they are right and I have lost it. It's all good. There are many reasons for not doing it,ask anyone they will give you a list a really big long list. That's fine, I completely respect there opinion. As for me, I know that any one of those reasons on that big ol list may actually be the reason I'm not able to complete a thru hike, but I know the one reason it won't be and that is ""BECAUSE I DID'T TRY!"" 
That person is no fool to give away what he cannot keep
to gain what he cannot lose.",,AT,"Dec 31, Tue",0
