Luis Campos,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478961,"I see 2016 many months away and wonder if it will ever get here. I held off writing in Trail Journals until tonight because I was pretty focused on hiking the AT. Lately, life happens and you get sidetracked. I started training back in May 2014, Gear researching, reading up on the trail and planning hikes to test everything so here I am challenged by the start date of mid April or fist of May 2016 it is so far off. Got to focus... focus...Anyone else have that problem? (I like Muffins! I like Muffins!- MY DAUGHTER TARA'S COMMENT'S) This what happens when go brush your teeth.I have got to send off Application for doing trail and get a trail name, this will happen soon. So tonight as I read some of 2016 journals, This helped get my focus back by starting my own. Thanks futures hikers of AT.   ",,Just getting started,"Dec 11, Thu",0
Luis Campos,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478963,"Living in Florida has it's challenges like hurricanes, sink holes, gators, sharks, traffic, and it is flat. Well mostly flat when you compare it to North Georgia or North Carolina. So to tackle a 2200 mile hike I have got to get creative. I have been training physically since May of this year, first with a small pack with 4-10lb plates (40lbs) doing a 1-2 hour walk 3 to 4 times a week. Now I am using a Mountainsmth circuit 3.0 with gear 45lbs,. hiking 9 miles 3 to 4 times a week. I hit the local gym for 1 to 2 hours of strength training. When I do not hike, The gym's treadmill and stepmill inclines come in handy alone with a 20lb weighted vest aid in my training. For Christmas I hope to get my own weighted vest. My goal is 13 to 15 miles 5 days a week and before I start the AT take 3 to 4 week long trips north to visit the Springer Mountain area for some real mountain hiking and gear testing. When I stop to think about it, I do not have a whole lot of time to prepare. When I am up north training I look forward to running into some experienced hikers for tips. Well happy hiking            ",,training FL?,"Dec 12, Fri",0
Luis Campos,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478964,"The idea of hiking the AT is only possible by the great support of my family and friends. I have kept it quiet until now because I wanted to see if physically I could handle it, I believe I can. My wife thinks my biggest challenge will be the 5 months away from her and my 11 year daughter. she is probably right. Only a hand full of people know right now, but that will change as my trip gets closer. So it will be interesting to hear the comments.  I titled it turning 50,because if all goes well I will be turning 50 Aug. 11 2016 2/3 to 3/4 into the trip. yeah buddy","training FL?
