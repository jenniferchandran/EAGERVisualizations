Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/510727,"I decided back in February that I was going to tackle the AT. I made the decision in the wake of my father's passing. Cancer had formed in his throat and took a brief and terrifying year and a half to destroy the rest of his body. My family, which had been all but the perfect fairy-tale storybook arrangement, was broken.After my father became ill I had dropped out of college, and then eventually work. After he passed my motivation for either of these things had all but diminished, but I forced myself to at least find a job. A few months later, restless, angry and directionless I stumbled across the Appalachian Trail. I needed to give myself a reason to keep 'doing life' for another year, so I decided to chase it.As of right now I've been six months at preparing- this has mostly involved saving money and selected/purchasing gear. As things stand I have most of my 'major' gear gathered up, which consists of my tent, bag, sleeping pad, water filter, cooking set and a new knife for the trail.Today marks exactly 200 days until I climb aboard a Greyhound in Columbus, OH and ride to my stop in Atlanta, GA.And you know, I'm fairly certain my dad would have been pretty happy to see me do this. He really, really hated camping but he also always pushed me to do the things I really wanted.",,200 Days to Georgia,"Aug 19, Wed",0
Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511507,"I was able to test out my backpack for the first time this weekend, hiking a short but very strenuous trail in Hocking known as Cantwell Cliffs. While I was pleased with my pack, and learned a few very important things about it, the hike did make me a bit nervous.Even though the pack only weighed 15 pounds (a little less than my goal base weight) and we only hiked for about three hours, I was surprised by how much more tiring it was to carry even that little extra weight.On the other hand, I guess I won't have much trouble getting sleep on the trail.",,Cantwell Cliffs,"Aug 26, Wed",0
Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512329,"I asked almost all my friends if they wanted to join my thru-hike. This question was almost always a bit of a joke, as I was well aware that they all had better things to do with their time than stumble around 2000 miles of mountains with me.Even so, I couldn't help feeling a little disappointed.Part of what makes the 'idea' of hiking the trail so intimidating is doing it alone. This is also part of the appeal.I am not antisocial, and, in fact I think I am relatively charismatic. That being said, I am an introvert. What fantasy could possibly trump that of months of near solitude?Obviously there are plenty of people to meet and 'team up' with along the trail, and I fully intend to do this at least as much as I walk solo. I love people. They are captivating and deep and impossible to fully explore. If I were a photographer I would rather capture faces than landscapes.But after any extended period of time with a person or persons I tend to retreat inwardly, and become very much truer to my introverted self. And this is good. After all, isn't the AT all about finding yourself? I don't know, maybe it isn't.I very much look forward to meeting my fellow hikers on the trail. I also look forward to being in that perfect, bittersweet solitude that seems to split open the sky. I'm also just a little bit scared of both of these things. Which, I think, is a good thing.",,Going it alone,"Sep 01, Tue",0
Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515124,"Today my grandfather and I went to see ""A Walk in the Woods"" together. I hadn't heard about the film until it had already been in the theaters for some time. Obviously I was interested as it is very relevant to what my life currently revolves around. I'm not sure one should frame their expectations of the AT based on the movie, however it was still a very enjoyable watch, and left me playing with my gear for some time today. I would encourage anyone who is hiking the AT to watch it just for the fun of it.In other news, October is finally here. I hate winter with a passion, but the changing of the season indicates time moving. It wasn't even a year ago that I made the decision to do this hike, and yet it feels like I've been waiting to do this my entire life.",,A Walk in the Woods,"Oct 03, Sat",0
Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518323,"I have a small countdown application on my smart phone that tells me, to the millisecond, how much time I have until I step onto the bus. I don't check it as often as I thought I would, and was shocked to find I only had 85 days left until my departure.A year ago, when the idea of hiking the AT first found its way into my head it sounded idyllic. Now, with less than three months to mentally and physically prepare, I'm becoming increasingly nervous. What started off sounding like something that I, of all people, could do, now suddenly seems like challenge that is impossibly big for me.As a perfectionist, I want to to it right, do it well and do it comfortably, without the need to purchase, exchange, or discard gear during the trip. I want to hike 20-mile days from day one.Of course, rationally, I know this is not possible, but I believe the root of my fear of failing is based in my fear of not doing it perfectly, and then giving up. Looks like I'll be muttering ""hike your own hike"" to my inner perfectionist for the first few weeks.Otherwise, I've been enjoying the practice hikes a lot, especially in the hilly areas. I really do despise the hiking poles, as they tie up your hands and make themselves a general pain. After using them several times now, however, I begrudgingly admit that I certainly need them. It's amazing what 25 extra pounds will do to your stamina.All these worries aside, I still can't wait to hit the trail and meet all the strange and pungent friends I'm sure to make.",,85 Days to Georgia,"Dec 12, Sat",0
Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518398,"As a young guy with small ambitions and only a vague interest in romance, a question I get asked a lot is ""So, what are you doing with your life?""I'm always inclined to respond ""Wasting it, thank you very much, and it's been lovely so far."" But of course, for the sake of politeness I tell them the only interesting thing that I can think of.I tell them I'm going to hike the AT.I always get the same exact questions in response to this, to the point where it's almost amusing. I thought it would be fun to list them off. In order, descending, from least to most common.10. What about bugs?9. How will you shower?8. Have you considered buying a SAT phone?7. How will you charge your phone?6. How will you poop?5. Where will you sleep?4. Are you bringing a gun?3. What/how will you eat?2. Are you going ALONE??1.

Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520294,"Yesterday I drove down to Tar Hollow for a practice hike now that all my gear is in and ready. My pack was ~35 pounds, and I hiked nearly 10 miles in about 6 hours. Unsurprisingly, I was very miserable hiking on a January day in Ohio. The snow made everything very slippery (it was 38 outside so everything was sort of melting.) The trail was incredibly difficult and hilly, not to mention I crossed a stream in about 2 dozen different places. It may not sound like a big deal, but it becomes very exhausting once you've been on the trail for a few hours! To top it off, the trail was poorly maintained, with entire trees laying across the path in some places. It was pretty, though.All that to say, it was a rather rude awakening as to what the AT will really be like. It didn't take me long at all to become very wet and very sore. I believe my idea of hiking big days at the start to leave the crowds behind is not going to work out at all- the only way I'm going to make it is to pace myself at the beginning. And, furthermore, to be easy on myself and allow myself to be sore tired and perhaps even grumpy until I get the hang of it.I still have 40 days until I leave for Springer mountain, so I'd better use it to continue practicing!",,Hiking in Tar Hollow,"Jan 27, Wed",0
Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521570,"On Friday I had an opportunity to visit the AT for a practice hike. It was a very brief walk, just hiking from Newfound Gap to Icewater shelter in back. It was only six miles and I was done in less than three hours.I'm very glad I got to see the AT in the snow, though! It was beautiful, and very quiet. I felt my misgivings about the trail melt away as I stepped over to my first white blaze and kissed it. The Smoky Mountains are a sight to behold, all blue and dusky indigo, and endless as far as they eye is concerned. It was warm at Newfound Gap, around fifty-give degrees, but much colder at the summit when I reached Icewater.There were a group of six hikers there who had stayed the night and attested that it had been at most twenty degrees through the night. This made me a bit nervous, and I certainly hope things warm up a little in the next two weeks. I didn't have all my gear with me, so I elected not to stay the night myself.Upon returning home I found myself in a near frenzy, packing, unpacking and repacking my pack, removing weight, making last minute purchases and organizing food. My brain has been bathed in a dizzying cocktail of excitement, anxiety and apprehension.Even as I write this, I'm nervous about the hike, and not sure if I'm going to make it all the way through or even make it very far. On the trail these fears seemed to melt away, but back at home, frantically trying to perfect my kit, I'm left uncertain again.That aside, the AT was stunning and I can't wait to get back, especially to the Smokies.",,Icewater Gap,"Feb 22, Mon",0
Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522955,"I've heard it said that it's a Greyhound bus that ferries unfortunate souls to Hell, and I'm now inclined to believe that. There is no hope of sleep on the overnight bus- even if it were possible, the sheer amount of stops and layovers eliminates the practicality. The only saving grace of my trip on the Greyhound was having an enjoyable riding partner. She told me about her tattoos, I told her about my trip and we took turns dozing off onto one another's shoulders.When I finally arrived at the approach trail (an 8 mile trail before hikers reach Springer mountain) I hadn't slept in 40 hours or eaten in 20. I made it about four miles before veering off to see if I could get a bed at the 'Hike Inn'. Unfortunately, you aren't allowed to camp on the approach trail, and I was unable to find a source of water after the falls.The Hike Inn was a beautiful motel/cabin hybrid, and I was served dinner and have been promised breakfast tomorrow. Judging by their initial reaction, however, it seems I should have made reservations, though I was given a generous discount for being a thru-hiker and I almost felt like some sort of folk hero. It seems thru-hikers don't stay here much.All in all, I'm glad to be off the bus and I can't wait for sleep. The plan is to hike to Springer Mountain and start officially tomorrow and stay at the Hawk Mountain shelter there. While this will be yet another short day (9 miles) it will give me a chance to recover a bit more","Appalachian Approach Trail

Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523039,"After a fantastic meal this morning at Hike Inn I headed out to cover the last 4 miles to Springer at 8:30. I reached the summit by 11 and was welcome by a large group of people sitting around the top. As I was resting, a southbound thru-hiker by the name of Rookie crested the summit and threw his hiking poles to the ground. He had started his hike in Maine in July, and was an instant celebrity. Everyone, myself included, got his picture.When I set off again I was hiking the AT! Finally, I was following the white blazes! I made pretty good time the first four miles, and passed Tall One, another Thru, on the way. Around 1 I stopped for a snack and a pipe, and realized that, despite being miserable and exhausted, I was completely elated. DoI'm already suffering from monkey butt and hotspots on both feet, hooray!I walked into Hawk Mountain shelter around four and by then had only considered quitting about 10 times. There were nearly 30 hikers there already, set up in tents and hammocks spread over a large area. Admittedly, many of the setups and gear were very intimidating to me, and made me realize just how little of an idea I have about what I'm doing. I even managed to burn my mashed potatoes.I'm now 8 miles into the AT, and the task before me has become even more daunting. I have resolved to think only about the day at hand and getting to the next shelter, otherwise I'll never make it.","Hike Inn

Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523111,"I was unable to sleep for some reason so I was already packed and underway by six this morning. My goal was to make it halfway to Neel Gap today and stay there at the hostel on Friday night. Somewhere in the process of packing in the dark my ibuprofen made it's way to the bottom of the pack. Yesterday I managed to roll my right ankle very badly, so I was sorely in need of it!About 3 miles in I was already ready to drop. I had asked myself the night before if I could do tomorrow, and I answered yes. So, I kept walking, unsure of how far I could actually go.About 4 miles down I met two Thrus at Cooper gap, Ultraviolet and Mel. Our goal was to get to Sanches that night and power our way over the first big hurdle, Blood Mountain, on Friday. Motivated by the possibility of a partner, and by the idea of the 30 hikers behind me catching up, I kept hiking.8 miles in I saw my first flock of trail angels! They had hotdogs and beer and I even got to smoke a cigarette for the first time in five days. It was even the kind I used to smoke before I quit for the trail. It didn't stop there though! They offered to drive Ultra and I's packs down about 4 miles while we ""slackpacked"" and we of course accepted.After we met back up with the angels I was taken aside and told about how my poor choice of clothes was going to leave me in a bad place by the time the storms rolled in for the weekend. I was given a few spare items (one of them being women's leggings, but I am already beyond embarresment). I was told what I need to purchase and send home at Neel Gap.Somehow I cranked out another 5 miles afterwards, arriving last a few minutes after Ultraviolet. Though tired, I am encouraged that this is only my second day and I've made it so far already. We're only six miles from Neel gap! Tomorrow Ultraviolet and I will try to blow this popsicle stand by 7 and beat the 40+ hikers here to the hostel. If we suceed the first big challenge of the journey will be done and we can relax the rest of the day. An item of note, Neel Gap is where approximately 20 percent of attempting NOBO's (north bound thru hikers) give up, which is what makes it such a hurdle. Also, I apologize for the sloppy writing and format, I'm racing against a dying battery.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523442,"Today's miles 7.3 trip miles 50.5After a miserable day on Blood Mountain I was feeling pretty uncertain about the future of my hike. In hopes of recovering somewhat I stayed the night at the hostel at Neels Gap, got a shower, did some laundry and switching up my gear at the store. At the hostel I met Quipun, Mountain Goat, California Chrome and Lauren and decided to tag along after we had a good evening together.Since, despite equipment failures and losses, awful food and mice destroying my stuff, the hike has been much better. On top of having good people to help you remain sane, Goat sets our pace each day, and we're moving slowly but comfortably. Going too fast was threatening to ruin my hike.Tomorrow I need to hitch to Helen to pick up a package with clothes that will allow me to survive the smokies, so I may lose them for a day or two. I'm not looking forward to this at all, but now that I've been on the AT for nearly a week my head is much more 'in the game'. For the first time since I left I feel like I might actually have a chance to get to Maine!","Blue Mountain Shelter

Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523532,"As of today I've been away from home for 1 week. Time is very strange out here- on one hand I feel as if I started yesterday, on the other I feel as if I've been doing this forever.This morning I had to hitch a ride from Unicoi gap to Helen for a mail drop where my mother and trail boss had sent me clothes, thanks to my lack of foresight in selecting them before I left. I'm proud to say I'm now equipped almost exclusively with fleece and wool. While waiting for the package I also had a chance to get some real food: a whole marinate chicken breast stuffed between two fat pieces of Texas toast and complimented with unlimited coffee which was generously given to me for free.After I made it back to the gap I hiked to Tray Mountain Shelter just 8 miles from the last. Here I discovered that Mountain Goat had moved on ahead but Quipun was at the shelter nursing an injury. I'm disappointed that I lost Goat, but I'm going to try to stay with Quip. We're going to do (another) short day tomorrow and plan to take a zero in Hiawassee on Wednesday where he'll get his injured ankle looked at. It's possible he'll get off there. On the bright side I got to reuinite with Ultraviolet, and pitched camp with her tonight.It was raining when I set up camp, and half my gear is drenched and flapping from a clothesline now. Fortunately I was able to dry my tent relatively well. If it wasn't for my new clothes I probably would have been forced to hike through the better part of the night to avoid hypothermia, but I'm now quite dry and warm.Finally, the shelter is in an incredible spot. The view is the best I've had so far, trumping even Blood Mountain, and I'm set up to witness what might be the most glorious sunset of my life. Also, no amount of prose can add to the fact that the clouds pass underneath and sometimes through the camp. Breathtaking.Today's current mile 59 location","Helen, GA

Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523893,"I've had a rough past few days, with my Sawyer insisting on leaking whenever I try to filter water and not having enough rope for my bear bag (which already needs replaced anyways). Goat and I had planned to stay in Franklin Saturday and Sunday night, and take a zero. My ankle is sorely in need of one. At Carter gap, Goat decided she was going to stick with a larger group and forgo the zero, so I went ahead and hiked to. Mooney gap and got a shuttle into town. It's been a very rough last few days, and I won't go into detail but I'm sorely, sorely tempted to quit. For some reason, I can't bring myself to do it just yet. Still, this weekend could be bad with night temperatures in the 20's. I'm just really tired of feeling so alone out here.In other news I got to see Bombadil and Goldberry at Bly, which was a nice surprise.Also, I just realized that trail journals is ""calculating"" my miles, but given the sporadic method of entry, I doubt it's accurate. I got off on mile 98.5 last night.","Helen, GA

Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524667,"It's been a while since I've had a chance to update, service has been considerably spottier and things have been pretty challenging the past few days.The zero in Franklin was good, but not quite enough to heal my ankle. Still, it was a nice little town and the two nights there gave me the mental help I needed to keep pushing.The night I left Franklin was bad. At the peak I stayed at the temperature dropped to single digits, and with the wind chill it was below zero. To top it off we had a lot of snow blow in with it. In hopes of avoiding that weather I pushed to the NOC the next day and slept at a much lower elevation. Even then, I still had to deal with frost.I then pushed really hard and ended up at Fontana, 27 miles from NOC in about a day and a half. In Fontana I split a room with Four Year and B-Hiker and was able to resupply for my first few days in the Smokies. I actually ran out of food between NOC and Fontana because I've been eating about twice as much as I was originally! So my resupplies are getting heavy.Tomorrow I'll cross the dam and go into the park. I hope to be out in about a week, because the restrictions in the Smokies could potentially make the trip miserable and the shelters (which we are required to stay at) are known to be hot spots for Nora (sp?) virus.After that I get to take a couple more zeros in Hot Springs with my mother and sister!","None

Quasimodo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525149,"This isn't an entry that I haven't been looking forward to writing. On my first morning in the Smokies I noticed that my stool was alarmingly black and tarry. This might seem like a bit too much information, but these things are important when you're out in the middle of nowhere.?I tried not to give this too much thought and pushed an 18 mile day from the first campsite to Derrick's Knob Shelter. My goal was to get into Gatlinburg Saturday night or Sunday morning. Despite having resupplied double what I had gotten from NOC previous, I found myself amazingly running out of food. It's no exagerration that ""hiker hunger"" means you're hungry all the time.Fortunately a hiker I met, Tea Time was extremely generous and gave me food from his own bag the day we pushed those 18 miles.The following morning I was again agitated to find my stool black and unhealthy looking. I packed up and headed out early, hoping to arrive at the shelter 3 miles from Newfound Gap and hitch into Gatlinburg the following morning. In about 5 hours I was able to travel only six miles. For some reason I was completely exhausted and winded, desite eating and drinking as much as I was able. I arrived at the closest shelter, and, while cooking a dinner, was alarmed to find how woozy and unsteady I felt.You aren't allowed to tent in the Smokies, but I pitched anyways just in case I had contracted something. From 1:30pm to 7:30am the next morning I rested in my tent and tried to continue eating and drinking. My stomach was mildly upset but mostly I felt generally weak. Tea Time again overwhelmed me with generosity and left me at the shelter with all his Crasins and two packs of Ramen. Despite feeling pretty pathetic I managed not to cry at his gesture and watched him push on. (He had gotten a start nearly 2 hours later than I had and caught me setting up camp).That night and the following morning my stool was still bad. Feeling slightly desperate I made the last six miles to Clingman's Dome, where I knew there was a parking lot thanks to my visit to the Smokies in Febuary. After an easy half day, food and sleep I was hoping I would be stronger. Such was not the case. I don't know if it was the elevation or just my general feeling of weakness, but I felt like I had a difficult time breathing al the way up the Clingman's Dome. After being out here so long and getting stronger and learning my limits, I was and still am completely amazed at how weak I've been these past 2 days.Eventually I made it to the lot and sheepishly stuck out my thumb. A family of four from my home state let me jump in the back of their clean white pickup and spirited me to Gatlinburg.That leaves me here. I have suspicions about my water filter, which has been a constant battle this whole time, but it was also suggested that it could be ""internal bleeding"", which sounds incredibly dramatic. I'm not sure what could cause this, but I've put my filter away and bought myself an excessive amount of gatoraide in hopes of purging my system and seeing if the problem persists.My uncle will be in Gatlinburg on Tuesday to take me back home to Columbus where I'll see my doctor if I don't start feeling better soon. Yes, this means I'm quitting.I'm not going to pretend that it was entirely this illness either. Even before I got this way I had been wondering, even on the good days, what I was doing out here. There were people back home to be with, things to do with my life, and better investments than Ramen and cheap motels to make. But what it boils down to is that I simply haven't been enjoying myself. That's it.Maybe coming out here I had misguided intentions. I wanted to prove something to myself and everyone else. Or even just do something ""significant"". I feel like I'm throwing away everyone's encouragements, the ones received both on the trail and on my journal, and squandering the material gifts too (primarily food from angels and hikers).Even during this brief trip I feel as if I've learned many important things- both about myself and the world at large. This ailment, whatever it might be, was the straw that broke the camel's back and sent me home, but it also forced me to stop and put this hike into perspective.Thank you everyone for being so encouraging and thoughtful. It's only thanks to everyone who supported me that I made it the 200+ miles that I did! There's no doubt it my mind that I'll be out here again someday.","Mollie Shelter
