Catnapper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554611,"I can't believe that in less than two weeks I'll be walking on the AT again from Georgia toward Maine. When I finished hiking the AT in 2015, I thought I'd be moving on to other things in life. After all, I'd seen the whole trail, gotten to experience many months of great hiking and fantastic fellowship, and made some precious friends. It was not to be.    Soon after finishing I found that I'd think very fond thoughts of the AT, and smile with so many memories. Whiteblaze is my computer home page, so I saw vignettes of the trail each time I turned it on. I kept in touch with some trail friends, and enjoyed rehashing good times. (Some are better in the retelling than in the original form. For instance, some of the ""interesting"" climbing along steeply sloped, wet rocks with lots of exposure are definitely easier to enjoy now than when engaged in getting my body from point A to B in one piece.) We had an extended trip to Canada planned for 2016, so plans for hiking could take a back seat for a while.     In mid 2016, I decided to attend the Appalachian Trail Institute run by Warren Doyle. There were several reasons for my attendance. I'd known about Warren for years, and admired all that he's done to promote the spirit of the AT. I thought it would be very interesting to meet him, and hear first hand his ways of the trail. In addition, several of the hikers I was with in 2015 and 2012 spoke very highly of the ATI program. They would often bring up notes from the program which described Warren's approach to a given section of the trail. Even hikers with many years of experience felt they had benefited by the program. The biggest reason I wanted to attend ATI had to do with mental and spiritual approaches to hiking. I had read a lot about Warren's approaches to mental toughness in hiking, and perseverance. I wanted to know more.    The upshot of attending ATI was that I became excited to hike the whole AT again. Even though I'd hiked the whole trail, I found lots of good info from Warren about better ways to approach certain sections. Most importantly, ATI caused me to fine-tune my mental attitude toward the trail. I've spent the winter getting ready to hike again, and I'm excited to see Springer in two weeks.",,On the road again,"Feb 12, Sun",0
Catnapper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554876,"29 years ago today our first daughter was both born and died. The road past that day was filled with challenges, tears and growth. When Jaime was born, we had no idea that we would only share a few minutes of life with her before she was in the arms of Jesus. As I make a few last minute preparations for the hike this year, I'm forced to reflect on all that has transpired in the following years, and on how God has shown direction and His ineffable support to us. In addition, I'm thinking about what new experiences and insights the coming hike will bring.    Over the three previous years I've been out on the trail, the topic of motivation often enters conversations. Hikers talk about what brought them to the trail, what is keeping them going, why they want to quit, or what goals they need to fulfill. I have been known to wax extensively about some of my perspectives, and there have been some fantastic campfire, campsite or shelter discussions on the topic. Some of my most memorable times on the trail in past years revolve around these discussions.    For the record, I'll share some of my motivations for previous years' hikes, and then try to elaborate as much as I can what I'm thinking about this year. In 2012 I had a limited time to hike early in the year. I had retired at the end of December 2011, and had child college graduation, a family trip, and child wedding to look forward to in the year. I hit the trail at the beginning of March because, I said to myself, it would be something fun to do for a while. I honestly didn't think to myself that hiking the AT was such a big thing to me. My family has subsequently pointed out that all the books about the AT around the house, our visits to trail crossing over the years and my periodic wistful looks as I spoke about the AT probably mean that the AT had been in my blood for some time. I had a great hike for two months in 2012. The Sheep picked me up from the trail, we traveled to directly to college graduation, with a haircut and multiple showers along the way to remove some mementos of the trail, and had a fantastic celebration. In the months to follow, we had a last family trip before the wedding, and went on with life. At the time, I would have said that my 2012 motivation to hike was just something that sounded like fun (which it was!). In retrospect, I can see many other motivations played into my decisions.    2013 saw me back on the trail in early March. Unlike the previous year, I had no big family commitments, so I could hike for as long as I wanted. I intended to finish the whole trail in 2013, and spend the summer doing it. In 2012 I had had fantastic weather, only seeing a few snowflakes near me in the whole two months I was out, and seeing snow on the mountains only in the distance. I never had had to hike on snow. In 2013, the weather was continually snowy, and I hiked only on snow for the first 22 days. There were multiple big storms, and cold temperatures. I little deep motivation to keep hiking, and succumbed to thoughts of warmth and comfort at home, leaving the trail before spring could make its way in.    2015 found me itching to get on the AT and finish it. My motivations included achieving the goal of doing the whole trail, but also the desire to become more a part of the incredible trail community. I achieved my goals, had some amazing experiences, and met some very special people. When I left the trail in 15, I thought I was done with hiking the AT; I had done what I wanted to do.    As I mentioned in a previous posting, I've now discovered that the trail is still calling. It is hard to pin down all the motivations for my hike this year, but I do have some clarity. Hikers talk about finding ""the meaning of life"" as a reason they might be hiking. I think that I have found that fundamental meaning in my relationship with Jesus, and His love. However, I believe that there is always more to know, more to experience. This year is a journey to learn more, experience more, and love more as I get to see the sights of the AT, spend lots of great time thinking, and meet so many wonderful new friends. John chapter 8 has a special meaning for me as I hike: Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. For me this year, my motivation is focused on learning more of that truth, and sharing my hike and my life with others.",,The road of life,"Feb 20, Mon",0
Catnapper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554906,"About 10 years ago, while I was still working, and the AT was just something I thought about on occasion, I went hiking with a daughter in Glacier National Park in Canada. Our hike brought us up a mountain on a trail with a bit over 3000 ft. of elevation gain over only a few miles. There were lots of steep sections; you could touch the trail in front of you in places. I did pretty well hiking up, and we enjoyed a great snack at the top. Coming down was a different story.    Almost immediately upon beginning our descent I realized that my knees were not up to the steep trail. I did not have the requisite stability, mobility or strength in the knees to safely descend the mountain. After some futile attempts to try different methods, I had to resort to sitting down on many of the steep sections and scooting down on my bottom. There was simply no other way I was going to make it down safely. I told my daughter several times that this would be the last hike I would ever be taking in the back country; my body (knees) was just not up to the task anymore. We left the park with me fondly reminiscing about the many great times I had had in the mountains, and thinking about the onset of old-age related issues.    I've had five knee surgeries. Ironically, none of my knee injuries was due to overuse or major accidents. All were due to very small actions taken by a body recovering from a lack of activity. For instance, I lost one set of ligaments stepping off a curb in town on the first day I could walk around after a couple months recovering from Legionnaires' disease picked up overseas. My orthopedist had performed all the requisite tests like MRIs, and told me that whenever I wanted, he'd replace the knees. My knees not only had no ligaments or meniscus, they were also heavily impacted by arthritis. Since I could still walk most places without too much discomfort, I hesitated to get the surgery.    Fortunately, I subsequently visited my doctor at work, and told her about my Glacier experience. She strongly recommended I see a physical therapist. I humored her by making an appointment to see a PT, but had absolutely no hope that it would lead to any beneficial outcome. On my first PT appointment, my therapist, Olivia, told me very confidently that she could get me into condition to hike again, and that surgery was not necessary. I was still completely unconvinced, but humored her by doing the amazingly difficult exercises she required, and even consented to return for more treatment. After a couple weeks, I began to see fantastic changes: I hurt much more than I did previously, and my knees were much more swollen than before. My whole body was rebelling at PT, and I just wanted to tell Olivia I was done. Fortunately, she would not let me quit. In a few more weeks, I started to be able to do things I couldn't do for many years prior. I began to have new confidence in my ability to handle rough surfaces, and to control my knees. When all the PT was done, I felt much better, and could see the obvious benefits.    I still did not think that PT had given me the ability to hike difficult trails again, but I eventually tried a pretty difficult trail near home. Not only could I hike it, it was a joy to hike. Yes, I still had knee discomfort descending, but I DID IT! Dreams of hiking the AT began to appear more often, and to have more of a sense of reality to them.    I've become a rabid believer in the power of PT to radically change the quality of a person's life. I now strongly encourage others who might benefit from PT to at least give it a try. I told Olivia when I was done that I was impressed, and very thankful for all she had done for me. I also told the doctor who recommended the PT that she was absolutely right in her approach. I since have retired, and I doubt either of them know how much of a difference they made in my life. I'm going to try to find each of them, and send them a note telling them that I went from barely making it on a trail to being out on the AT for my fourth year now. Thanks Olivia and Dr. T.",,You can do it,"Feb 21, Tue",0
Catnapper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554939,"Q: What should I do when there are only three full days left before I leave the warmth and comfort of home and prepare to spend the next few months making my way north from Georgia?A: Write about some of the goals I have for this adventure, and smile about some of the memories about to be made.    In my professional career I worked for a while with people in a giant corporation who regularly had to provide research and development goals for management. One of the best lessons I had from this working experience was the management requirement that you formulate goals which, in your best estimation, were only 60% achievable. If, at the end of the year, you achieved everything you had said you were trying to do, the feeling was that you had not tried to reach far enough. In my own professional career, and in much of the rest of my life, I embraced this same approach to goal setting: I reached for the stars. I knew that even if I didn't reach a particular star, I had still done something good.    I've spent a good bit of time formulating my goals for this adventure, and will share some of these goals here. There are some goals which are either more personal or audacious which I'll leave for another time, or never. Some of the goals relate specifically to the hike, others have to do with my relationships with others, both hikers and friends. Some goals I see as having long-term ramifications if achieved, others are just nice experiences for the year.    I'll start with some simple hiking logistical goals. First, in the past I have lost significant weight as I've hiked, and often been enormously hungry as I went. It isn't that I didn't pack lots of food; I aimed at 4700 calories a day hiking, with more when I was in town. I tallied up the calories in my cart as I resupplied, and made choices to insure I got all the calories in a weight I could manage. If you look at my 2015 trail journal you will see numerous instances where my eating was a central part of my activities at a trail junction. This year I plan to continue with a well-supplied back country food larder, but I'm going to regularly practice something I only periodically did before. I'll pack out of town with a very nice, non-trail-type meal to eat as my first meal back. For instance, I might take a big sub sandwich with a half gallon carton of chocolate milk to eat with maybe a cheesecake for desert. My usual procedure is to hike maybe 3-5 miles out of town, and then enjoy a decadent meal. The big disadvantage of this approach, and one which I'm willing to tolerate, is that there is often a big climb as one leaves from a resupply. Resupply access is often at a gap in the mountains, or a valley.     I've already done the trail, so another goal of mine is to see places I didn't see before, or to revisit some favorite spots. I am very much of a wanderer, and think nothing of walking miles off the trail to a particularly pretty lake or a good restaurant. There were some nice towns near the trail that in 15 I just saw as I quickly resupplied; I make sightsee a bit more in some of them. This is one reason I'm leaving so early in the year: I don't want to feel at all rushed. If 15 is a guide, I expect that I'll have actually walked 3000-4000 miles at the end of the hike even though the trail itself is only 2189.8 miles this year. Some of my off-trail destinations, like exploring the mountains just north of Damascus, might well take more than a day or two. I've printed a notional schedule based on AWOL's 12 mile per day suggestions. The notional schedule gets me to Katahdin October 1. If I am ahead of that notional schedule I know that I have a fairly easy shot of still making it to Katahdin if I stick to it. I also know I can afford the time to do other things if I want. Generally, I look at that notional schedule about once a week to insure I'm still ahead of it, and then do what I want for the week.     Some of my more ambitious hiking goals include explorations of more of the White Mountains in New Hampshire than are on the AT. I received some great maps and trail guides of the area as gifts for Christmas. I thought that this part of the trail had some very interesting features, and, if time permits, would like to see more of this region I first visited as a little boy many years ago. There are also a number of water features near the trail I'd like to visit this year which require some detours. Last time I visited several lakes and waterfalls within a few miles of the trail; this time I'll find some more. Of course, I'll also be visiting Quincy Bog if I can, a long-time favorite spot of mine. It will require a somewhat significant detour, but will be worth it. See my 15 journal for details about this special place.     As I say, there are other, some quite difficult, goals I have in mind. Maybe I'll even accomplish more than 60% of them!",,What do I want to do?,"Feb 22, Wed",0

Catnapper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555308,"The Hikers Hostel lived up to its good reputation; I was picked up in a timely manner in Atlanta, and arrived at their beautiful facility after a stop at Walmart for last minute supplies and dinner. There was much excitement and nervous energy among the guests. Some were planning to be out for a few weeks, others for the whole trail. Several hikers were from overseas.     In the morning we had a good hiking breakfast including eggs, grits, pancakes,orange juice and oatmeal. I ate everything except the oatmeal since I expect to eat it many mornings on the trail.     A bit after 9 we were at the parking lot north of Springer, ready to go. If you start here, you need to walk south first to get to the Southern terminus, and then turn around and backtrack northbound on the way. The alternative is to hike the 8 mile approach trail from Amacola state Park. I've been on the approach trail twice and did not feel the need to climb the more than 600 steps next to the falls, nor the rest of the steep trail.    I signed the trail register located in a rock at the summit, took a few pictures, and headed north. The day was cool but sunny. There were some beautiful icicles hanging from some of the springs. My favorite sight on such days is the huge rime frost rising from the ground as moisture comes out of the breathing earth. Sometimes the frost crystals rise 4 inches off the surface.    The day went peacefully, and I ended up going further than most of the other starters. Evening found me camped by myself on a scenic mountainside, nestled in the woods. I set up the tent, did evening chores, and prepared for bed. There was a small concern in my head about my body, so I was thinking about that as I went to sleep. As it turns out, my concern might have been justified. More in the next entry.","

Catnapper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555354,"As I mentioned in yesterday's post, I went to sleep thinking there might be some possibility of a medical issue. I awakened at 3:19 and confirmed my suspicions. After lying on my very comfortable pad snugged in my bag on this cold and windy morning for a bit, I broke camp and was hiking about 2 hours before sunrise. I often start hiking early, but today it wasn't for pleasure. I wanted to head up the trail a good distance and seek some medical advice and help as needed. I wouldn't mind dying someday, but didn't want to do something stupid like staying out with a medical condition and making today my day of death. I knew I had an issue, and should address it diligently now. After a few hours of hiking I realized I would be at a road crossing where I might call for help out to civilization. Fortunately, I found a spot with cell service, and was able to arrange a ride out and then to Atlanta.     By the way, I am not elaborating on the condition since I am not looking for Internet advice. I had seen my doctor just 12 days prior to discuss the issue. I knew the basic guidelines I should follow. Primary among them was that hiking was not indicated while the condition was bad.    I rented a car for a few days so I could get myself where I needed to go. By evening I was back by the trail, and had a bit of hope that I might be able to hike more, but it really looked most likely that I was done with the adventure. I went to sleep thinking about what else I might do this summer. I had felt physically horrible this morning, and still felt bad as I went to sleep. My year's plans, and indeed many of my other considered projects, were in jeopardy. Time will tell what happens. I'm waiting to see how the story unfolds.","On the mountainside Sassafras

Catnapper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555409,"I awoke early again, and was moving before 5. This was a day to evaluate my body with some easier tasks to see what would happen. I felt somewhat better this morning than yesterday. I feel I'm following sound advice, and just need to see what God has in store for me.     I accomplished a reasonable hike with a quite light pack, and only had a few if any body problems. Just sitting around would have been too hard for me. It was good to put more miles down. As it turns out I had to walk in a thick fog, but I missed a combo snow, sleet, and freezing rain event on that section of trail by just hours.    Midmorning I met Pokeymom and gave her a ride to the store. We had a great visit at Mountain Crossings as well. While there I met a couple hikers who had asked me if I'd needed help a couple days ago. One was leaving the trail because it was more difficult than she had imagined. The other was going to tent there for a day or so to recover from the first 31 miles.    I ended the day getting a bit of new equipment, including a titanium pot I have lusted after for at least 7 years. The purchases are a sign that I think I'll be continuing up the AT. I just need to figure out how to make hike fit body. There is a serene confidence in me related to being able to do this in an effective manner.     A couple months ago I was in a race where I did 101 miles. Fairly early on I'd felt very poorly. I persevered, and ended up with a respectable distance for a 63 year old man. As my signature notes, and I mentioned in an earlier post, my way to approach life is to see how much I can do. If I always succeeded in everything I tried, I'm not trying hard enough things.    By the way, the destination name today is in honor of my fellow 2012 hikers, Further, who overcame enormous obstacles on his trip.","Waiting

Catnapper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555452,"I was up well before dawn again, raring to go. I like doing some of the food challenges along the way, and the pancake challenge sounded like fun, but I wouldn't have felt like hiking for a while after I ate them. Details of the challenge are in another picture I posted. I don't care about getting my picture in the local paper, Egypt I've already gotten to put my name on several walls in past years challenges. So, I had 4 biscuits and gravy, 6 ounces of chocolate with almonds, a protein bar and some peanuts and called it a breakfast.     The hiking today was simply great. My body did well, and I felt good but tired at the end. I was motivated to get the hike over as early as I could because severe thunderstorms and potential tornadoes were predicted. In 2012 I was tenting pretty close to an area that had tornado warning sirens going. Today I wanted to end the day near a reasonably safe location, which I did. There were torrential rains in the late afternoon coupled with spectacular thunder and lightning. I was very glad I wasn't hiking.    I will continue to ramp up my activity.

Catnapper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555465,"What a great day it was to be on the AT! I started out early again this morning, and was enjoying the (for March) moderate temperature--37. Four amazing things stand out about this hike. First, the sky was notably clear for the east. I'm used to seeing clear crisp skies in the west, but the eastern skies often have a lot of obscuring humidity.     Second, the heavy rain yesterday knocked down lots of limbs from the trees,littering the trail. There were a good number of limbs the diameter of my arm. Third, there were several spots where homes had been, and the early spring domestic flowers like daffodils and forsythia which had probably been growing there for decades were blooming. In the four years I've been around the AT at this time of year, this is the earliest I've seen these plants bloom.    The most surprising thing about this walk, however, was that I wasn't alone. Within a couple minutes of when I started there were two hikers also starting. I was impressed with their speed; we didn't have time to say anything other than good morning. I met them again down the trail as they were doing everything they could to warm up. They didn't have particularly warm clothes on, and were going quickly to try to warm up. I didn't see them again, so I suspect they retreated to their truck for warmth.     I got several great tranches of advice yesterday. I'd particularly like to thank Bob at Top of Georgia Hostel for some great leads for slack packing. I met him later today and thanked him in person.    Towards the end of the day today I saw my first snake of the season. I've been seeing lots of bear signs like overturned rotten logs clawed apart for the bugs, but so far no bears. In past years I've often seen more bears than hikers who start later in the day. I presume I see them before they hide for day away from all the folks on the trail.","Onward

Catnapper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555563,"It was a day of hiking mixed with addressing logistics for the next couple weeks before I return the car I'd rented earlier when I had some medical issues. It always causes me to pause when I can drive from trailhead to trailhead in an hour or so, and realize that there might be a week of hiking between those points.    After some very cold and windy weather hiking early in the morning I was driving up to the Smokies where I'll be hiking later. I was surprised and delighted to see elk on the way. There were several cows, and what I supposed was a yearling. I learned later that elk have been reintroduced to the Smokies using some stock from Tennessee and Kentucky herds, and some from Elk Island in Alberta Canada. Apparently the herd is doing well. It was located for the winter north of the Newfound Gap road, and in the valley east of the trail.    I wanted to stop in Gatlinburg next for my logistical prep. On past hikes I've eaten at Bennetts barbeque there; they have good food at reasonable prices. I was treated this time to exceptional service by a lady who works there I'll just call A to avoid embarrassing her. She took a hiker who was cold and very hungry and made him warm, filled up, and ready to go forth. Thanks, A for such great trail magic!    You may have heard about all the fires that impacted places along the Southern AT last year. There are big swaths where the fires raced through the trees. Where necessary for safety or passage, trees have been downed and cut. Most of the fire-impacted trees I saw are still standing. Based on my experience with burns like this in my own state, I expect that the dead trees will be falling for years to come. Hikers will need to be careful to avoid these ""widow makers"" as they select tenting locations. There are already some new prepared camping sites set up by trail maintaining clubs. What strikes me as marvellous is all the new growth and life already covering the burn areas. It also appears that a fair number of trees survived in the burn areas I saw.    I'll probably have at most one additional post before I will be out of touch as I enjoy some extended wilderness time. The weather has been so great that I want to do as much as I can now; I can then feel free to take a day or two off if the weather turns rotten.","Upward

Catnapper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555707,"Well, I've had some more time hiking, and I think my trail body might be coming into play. Most hikers speak of trail legs, that strength and endurance which develops in the first weeks. I think I had the trail legs, but not the trail body. I'm about to go out for around a week or so; it will be exciting to see how I finish this next section: is the body ready for a lot more????    We just celebrated (remotely) the birthday of the wind beneath my wings. Without her, my life would be so different. I doubt I'd be doing many of the things I now enjoy. She keeps the home fires burning, and even more important, keeps a spot in her heart for me.

Catnapper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556354,"After leaving the final trappings of civilization behind which I'd been using to check on the medical condition I'd been experiencing, I left for a longer hike through the Smokies. Unlike most of the rest of the AT, a thru hiker is required to stay at a shelter if there is space. If there is not space, the hiker is required to tent in the area of the shelter instead. Because of this significant limitation on where one can camp, daily mileage goals are quantized: you need to go from one allowed location to another. I was feeling very energetic, and had plans in my head about goals based on how I found the trail.     In 2012 I found parts of the Smokies trails covered with ice as I hiked. These mountains are quite a bit higher than those passed earlier in Georgia and North Carolina, and the ground stays frozen well into March often. The highest point on the AT is around the middle of the trail in the Smokies: Clingman's Dome. As I headed out, the trail looked clear, and just wet. I had hopes of making big miles for the next few days. There was significant motivation behind my hopes in two directions. First, a very cold weather system was expected in a week or so. A significant snow fall was anticipated to accompany the system. Second, my friends Philamanjaro and Popsicle had offered to meet me at the end of the Smokies. We had hiked together a good bit in 2015, and I was looking forward to seeing them.     Within half an hour of heading out, it became clear to me that the trail was going to be very icy in lots of spots. In fact, even though this year has had the best all around weather I've experienced on the AT, this was some of the worst of the ice I've ever encountered. Cold temperatures combined with a lack of much snow meant that the ground was frozen without even the slight traction that a bit of snow can help provide. Nevertheless, progress was good, and I felt propelled up the trail. As I approached the shelter I was aiming for for the night, I noted that there were only a few other hikers. This meant that I couldn't use my tent, and would have to use the shelter. The night was forecast to be very cold, so I would have preferred the tent which usually provides a significantly warmer (my measurements: about 12 F) environment, and an environment free of mice running over my bag and body.       As I set up for the night, and prepared dinner, I could tell that my nemesis health issue was still there. Nevertheless, I felt good about the fact that I was moving well, and my body in general was able to put in the miles.","Better

Catnapper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556358,"A check of the weather this morning revealed that the anticipated snow storm was indeed still on the way, and that it might be bad enough to impact the ease of hiking on the trail. I was the first to leave the shelter, as is often the case. I like to start hiking as soon as it is light enough to see, and sometimes even a bit before that, using a light. Not only is this a good idea because I'm an early bird, but on the AT it has several bonus benefits. First, I am often at my destination for the day before one of the frequent afternoon thunderstorms hit. While others may still have miles to go, I'm huddled into my tent in relative comfort. Second, many of the animals along the trail are still out when I start. I tend to see more bear, deer and other large mammals because of my early start. Third, I'm a relatively slow hiker. The earlier start times allow me to take my time and still do the miles I desire.    This was one of the days I was hoping to do some relatively big mileage so that I could leave the Smokies before the storm. The trail had lots of ups and downs, along with a good share of rocky areas. Like many hikers, I find the downs to be much harder than the ups. After a few weeks, your body has the endurance to climb most hills without too much problem. Going down, however, even with the hiking poles I essentially always use, is a slow process which taxes my arthritic knees and hips. I had decided to pass shelters today, focused on miles rather than on spending more days in these mountains.     My body endurance was good, but my health concerns were fully in evidence. I pushed to move forward quickly, and tried to ignore how rotten parts of me felt. I was later in the day, the weather became pretty wet, and I was able to admire the beauty of the Smokies in the fog. Coming from the west where fogs are somewhat uncommon, I really enjoy seeing the fogs roll over the verdant hills of the Appalachians. After a long day of hiking, I settled down into yet another shelter with room for me, so no tenting again. We had some very interesting discussions in the evening, past the traditional hiker bedtimes. The night was cold, and you could feel the changes in the weather coming.     My thoughts this day often were considering why exactly I was out on the AT for a fourth year. I remembered the trail very well, and did enjoy seeing some of my favorite spots. However, I was considering other aspects of my hike. Since I retired years ago, I've not spent an entire summer at home. If I wasn't hiking, I was traveling with The Sheep. These were all good things, but I was now thinking more closely about my ""need"" to spend six more months out on the trail.","Smokies

Catnapper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556360,"Friday and Saturday were focused on lots of hiking. I was very determined to get through the Smokies. Not only did I want to avoid the brunt of the upcoming storm, and see my friends Philamanjaro and Popsicle, but my body was still exhibiting signs that it was not happy with me. I wanted to get out to civilization in case I needed to receive any medical assistance, or in case I ended up not being able to hike any more. I did not want to be the subject of any rescue efforts, or even need any assistance.     While there was a bit of sun one morning, most of these two days was overcast, and it precipitated almost all the time I was hiking. The precipitation did, however, provide variety. I saw rain, fog, sleet, snow and hail. Because of the relatively low temperatures, I also got to experience the fresh ice being formed on the trail. I just dug into myself and moved forward. I was generating enough body heat by my movement that I had on just a light base layer and shirt, and was comfortably warm. The base layer stayed warm enough that the precipitation which hit me would be evaporated off in a short time. I did have gloves on which began to develop some pretty icicles on the back surface. My pack at times had over an inch of snow on it.     Standing Bear Hostel, just past the Smokies, was my destination for Saturday night. I would be sheltered, in reach of civilization, and at a spot my friends could meet me the next day. I've visited the hostel a number of times on my hikes, and it has many memories for me. The hostel is located about 0.3 miles off the trail, up a moderately steep hill. I was trudging up the hill, tired at the end of a long day of hiking when a wonderful trail angel who was going to do a section hike in the Smokies starting that day stopped and gave me a ride the last 0.1 miles. I know it might not sound like much, but I really appreciated the ride. The folks at the hostel were going to give my angel a shuttle ride out to the trail, and she was going to hike back to the hostel where she was leaving her car.     I ate lots of food in the warmth and comfort of the hostel, and was preparing for bed when one of the folks who works at the hostel told me that all the roads going into the Smokies had been closed because of the snow. My angel would not be able to be shuttled to her starting location because of the snow. She lost her chance of this section hike, and would have to return home to hike another time. Like many of the other section hikers I met in the Smokies, I believe she was a teacher, taking advantage of spring break to hike a bit. I felt bad for her that she had traveled so far, and could not hike.     In the warmth and comfort of the hostel I reorganized my pack and thoughts. I was still wondering why I was out here for a fourth year. It was important to take time when I wasn't freezing to think about things. I also needed to dry out my things in preparation for the next activities. It was amazing how much water dripped off the outside of my pack. I went to sleep enjoying the sounds of a brisk wind blowing some snow around because I was inside away from it all. In the morning I'd see friends.","Smokies
