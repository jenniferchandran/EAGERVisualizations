My son and camp friend joined us in the evening. On Saturday, we got up and helped the Uwharrie Trailblazers with a trail work day. Our crew helped build a few armored gutters in the old farm road that ascends Little Long Mountain. We moved a lot of rocks from higher up on the hillside to the trail grade. The trail was developing gulley washes due to a wet winter. in the afternoon we went up to the shelter and signed in. Budget needed to get home. The young men and I slack packed another 9 miles.

While I'm not looking, she puts her stuffed bear in my pack, and proceeds to roll the top closed, and snap clasp the buckles.Later that day, as we paused at the highest point on the Uwharrie Trail, King Mountain, all 1022 feet, I opened my pack and there is the stuffed bear.

Buffalo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537716,"About a month ago, our Pastor and other church members inquired about having a blessing of the hikers, along the form of the blessing of the backpacks at the beginning of the school year. Naturally I said yes. Our pastor developed a part of the service for this, the choir agreed to sing a special anthem, and I set up my tent, Sawyer Squeeze, sleeping bag, trekking poles, and a bag with 5 days ration; then I climbed in to demonstrate my living space. She proceeded to create a meaningful poem, which allowed us to feel the support and prayers of the cloud of witnesses.
And the preacher said:
The AT awaits
The journey beckons
wanderlust fills
the adventurous
Mount Katahdin is the first
Step along the way
A test of physical
But mostly mental
And spiritual strength
Following white blazes
Over mountainous terrain
Rocks, roots, and mud
Ticks and mosquitoes
Chipmunks, squirrels
Wild Turkeys in Maryland
Deer along the river banks
Black bears rare to be seen
Mount Rogers, Grassy Ridge Bald
Mount Washington, Thunderhead Mountain
Are just some of the peaks that wait
For your feet to pass
The wonder and awe of nature
As you look up at the heavens
At night
The moon and the stars
And the reality of how small
We truly are in the midst
Of God’s creation
There is risk too
In this venture
Copperheads and rattlers
Bears
And slippery slopes
And yet something deep within
Calls to you
And so we your church family
Who love and care for you
Offer you our blessings on the way
We promise to pray for your safety
And to care for your loved ones
As they wait and worry.
May God guide your feet
And keep your steps secure
May God lead you along the way
And keep you safe from harm
May you experience the wonder
And joy of God’s creation
May God give you the strength
To make this journey
And provide light for your path
Along the way
(Pastor Carol)
ALL:
May the paths rise to meet you
May the wind be always at your back
May God’s blessing be upon you
To keep you safe, until we meet again
May you be held gently in the palm
Of God’s hand.",,Hikers Blessing,"Jun 05, Sun",0

There is more rain forecast for Monday in the Katahdin area, so strong probability that we will be another day. Lot of conversation with NOBO's who completed their AT hikes. Excellent recommendations to get ""trail fit"" prior to going for distance. I was able to relieve one of of leftover fuel and food, while I donated my flight to a guy going home.

Yesterday Budget and I loaded our food drop buckets for the 100 Mile Wilderness; we were able to split our food into 2 drops so less to carry on individual days during the last 5 days.

Buffalo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538471,"Updated: We were able to summit Mt. Katahdin on our second attempt. The morning skies were clear although the forecast included some clouds and sprinkles in the afternoon. We happened to link up with Weather, who has already done 1900 miles. As we ascended, he complimented us on being trail ready. When we reached the tree line, it was very windy, estimated to be 40 mph. We put on additional layers to stay warm. You are only halfway when you reach the tree line. It becomes a much more strenuous climb, including a section of bouldering so steep that there is rebar in the rock for handholds and footholds. Also the strong wind would blow your foot sideways when you lifted it to take the next step. There is a Flatlands section that is cordoned off so hikers don't damage the delicate plant life. We summited, took pictures of each other at the sign, and ate a small lunch, huddled around rocks to dodge the wind. Then we descended. At the tree line, where Weather had hidden his trekking poles, someone had found them and they were gone; we would later discover that they had been turned in at the ranger station. Weather took off to find his poles and we did not see him the remainder of the day. We tented in campsite 20 with a father and son team, Cyborg and Narato. Although today's distance shows as 5 miles, that is because the AT starts at the top of Katahdin, and your 5 miles getting there don't count in your trail mileage.
Hi. This is Sarah and I got my first phone call today since Buffalo summited Mt. Katahdin. He was using a satellite pay phone so the call was brief. He sent a great picture of Budget and him standing on Mt. Katahdin and another from Rainbow Ledges looking back at Katahdin 21.1 miles away. Both are doing great.","Katahdin Steam Park

Buffalo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539823,"Today, Budget became an honorary Ninja Turtle. That is not something specifically on our list of reasons to hike the AT, it just happened. We arrived at Pollywog Gorge, took the requisite pictures of each other, packed up our cameras and were about to re-embark on our journey. By happen chance, I spotted a sizable turtle shell WEDGED in the impressive sluice rocks of the gorge (turtle wedgie?). I exclaimed to Budget that we needed to do a rescue, and after showing him the shell he literally sprang in to action by jumping down into the ravine. The hind legs and tail were dangling out the back of the shell and we figured the creature was likely dead. As soon as Budget put his hands on the shell, the snapping turtle's head came out and reached around to bite him, and we went to plan B - get a big stick, plenty available. Budget was able to pry the turtle loose from its doomed captivity, but it was upside down in the shallow part of the sluice. After a couple of pokes, the turtle was righted, and immediately and naturally sought out deeper water. Happy ending :-)
We promptly sat down on the rocks and and had a philosophical discussion. Had we done the right thing? Was the turtle going upstream? Had it been washed downstream? Or was it trying to cross the stream, and if so, to which side? Had Providence set us on a course some 60 years ago that our 3 lives would converge at this time and location? Terrapins have been around a lot longer than we, and the rocks even longer; so was this actually some cosmological event? We departed the scene with a renewed sense of fulfillment and purpose, at least feeling like we had done the right thing. On my why list is Clarity of Mind, and to some degree that was provided today.
In the evening, we passed near a public camping area, and could smell hamburgers cooking. We stealth camped about a 1/4 mile short of the Namahkanta Campsites. (Sorry the the turtle pictures in the gallery are blurry; I zoomed in under less than bright sunlight and there was a lot of motion.)","Rainbow Stream Shelter

Buffalo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539162,"Hi from Sarah. I heard from Buffalo in a text on Sunday, June 19. He said he would be brief to save his battery. He is feeling good, but DEET is like an appetizer for the black flies on the trail. He and Budget completed 56 miles at that point. I got word tonight from Budget's wife that Mark's phone battery is depleted so I think I won't have another update until they finish the 100 Mile Wilderness.
Thanks to Elizabeth for walking me through the process of updating the Journal. I hope to be able to add miles and more details soon.
Until then check Budget's journal. His daughter-in-law LB is doing a great job of updating their information. http://trailjournals.com/entry.cfm?id=538864

He also popped his Sawyer Squeeze bag, so we'll be getting one of those in the mail  After camping at Philmont, they were excited to have clean water everywhere so far.Sounds like he and Budget had a blast staying in Monson for the anniversary celebration at the Lakeshore Hostel. They headed back to the trail by shuttle Monday morning.Over the weekend Dad posted and captioned most of his pictures from the 100-mile wilderness and Monson, make sure you check them out.

Buffalo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540719,"Hi again! Elizabeth here.Sorry we've not updated as frequently! Dad has sent us some information, but all the Schiemanns are traveling - 3 touring DC for the 4th, 2 on a cruise, and falling down on the trail journal job On Saturday (07/02) he said they were at mile 186 at Cranberry Stream campsite. I think they summited Avery Peak and we got some great pictures from that. He also commented on their online following. Thank you to everyone who has left a comment and is following along. They really appreciate your positive thoughts!On Sunday, he sent photos from their room at White Wolf Inn and Budget sent us a picture of dad finishing the Wolf Burger Meal in Stratton (8oz hamburger, sausage, bacon, cheese, 'shrooms, lettuce, tomato, onion, relish on a sour dough roll, and some fries.) Budget got ""The Beast"" burger and had chocolate milk and bbq chips earlier for snack.We are glad we sent the two-pack of the Sawyer Squeeze bags, because apparently after they left Caratunk his second water bag popped. He is trying not to use iodine because his Thyroid is not as regulated as his Dr. wants. So Budget shared his bag, and treated his water with Chlorine tabs. We are so grateful they are traveling together!Today (07/04), they are taking a zero day in Stratton, which will hopefully be some time for dad's cold to clear up and for us to figure out a diabetes prescription.

Buffalo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540904,"Hi again from Elizabeth!I think the plan this morning was to leave Stratton after a post office drop around 8:30 am and hike about 7 miles today. When I heard from dad this afternoon he texted that their total miles are 196.6. Today's photo is from a spring they found at 192.3We talked on the phone for a while yesterday. They are meeting great folks and have encountered trail magic a few times already. Apparently, a family from Southern Pines had been following them online and a mom (or daughter) caught up with them on the trail Buffalo said he used his zero day to eat, and caption his photos, and eat, and then eat again. Apparently a restaurant they were at ran out of food, probably because of the holiday change in food delivery...Anyway back to the trail stuff, y'all are interested in-Dad has been really impressed with the work the Maine ATC has done along the sections they've hiked. Especially the stone work for steps and the boardwalks. He says it is really well maintained and clearly blazed. After being in a scout troop that has helped with trail maintenance he and Budget know about the prep, energy, time and interest it takes to contribute to trails in your area.I think they are finishing up in the Bigelow range and there are peaks above 3,500/4,000 feet. Check out the ATC elevation map! Also, the area was preserved by a local citizens group and has remained public access.They are headed towards Rangely and we've got a couple of deliveries we hope will catch them there.","Stratton

Mom shipped some anyway. And now for a little PSA - my mom has been such a trooper, both supporting dad as he planned, but also now that he's on the trail. Not only is she a prayer warrior, she is also now the insurance ninja and health care navigator.

Dad has noticed that the pasta sides seem to impact his sugar levels (higher) than the potatoes and ramen. So, for now, we've replaced all the pasta sides with two ramens or a pack of potatoes. I think he is still spicing all of those options up with Bacon Bits. We also scaled back on the mini snickers (from 4 a day to 1).

We arrived in the early afternoon and were treated to a bowl of (cold) leftover beef stew. A bowl of rice was available for additional carbs which I passed. There also a couple of leftover well done pancakes which we also ate. Our bunk room was in a separate building, with 4 individual rooms, each with at least 2 bunks. I took the top bunk. We changed in to dry clothes and I attended to the wounds on my legs. Supper was served family style at picnic tables in the main hut. The menu included split pea soup, broccoli, lasagna, salad, bread baked onsite, and a chocolate chip gooey bar; I did indulge in one piece of the dessert. The ""croo"" as the staff are called, consisted of environmental students from Tufts and Yale. As well as being entertaining and answering guests questions, they also provided an LNT educational class afterwards. There is a junior naturalist contest provided for youth. A diverse group of guests from thru hikers, generational families, and day hikers made for interesting conversation. There was a full moon which was exquisite and I can only hope you faithful readers saw it where you live. Three blankets were provided for each bunk, and I slept well. In the morning we were treated to homemade sweet bread, oatmeal, bacon, and quiche Lorraine, and the usual array of beverages.

If you are interested in gear, my sister and I got some pre-winter gear for dad to try out this weekend. Buffalo switched out the t-shirt and shorts he has been using, as well as eliminating some other unused small gear. He added some lightweight top/bottom capilene base layers, and a Merino top/bottom layer for pajamas. He also swapped out some new socks and liners, and got a new hat so I can send in his Tilley for a replacement. He noticed on Friday afternoon that the tip of one of the walking sticks was worn, but we forgot, so he tried to fix that today... ended up breaking two multi-tool pliers, beat the old one off with a rock, and then the new tip on.","Rest in Harper's Ferry

Instead of that hike, they decided we would be better off slacking the 23 miles we were going to do on Saturday. There are more road crossings in case I needed to be extracted. So we slack packed from Elk Garden to Damascus today for a total of 23 miles. I had no additional stomach issues. While we didn't step on mile post 1689.1, we did hike the distance; so our home bound distance is now less than 500 miles! The section we hiked today crossed the Virginia Creeper bicycle trail.

""We started our 26 mile slack pack at 07:24 at Dickey Gap. We passed several deer hunters on the forest service road on the way to the trailhead. The trail was more rocky than I remembered. Also some parts were covered in layers of leaves which were slippery. We had walked 4 miles by 09:18, so we declared that we had hiked 1700 miles! I recognized Fox Creek trailhead after hiking the 1st 8 miles. From there it felt like we were on home turf since we have been on several scout camping trips in the Mt. Rogers recreation area. We had lunch at the Old Orchard shelter, since we needed the calories. We came across ponies several times, and they ignored us. There were quite a few cavalcades of people riding horses at Fox Creek and The Scales. Some people were also camping at The Scales near the corral gate. One jokingly asked us for the password; I responded with ""Appalachian Trail SOBO thru hiker"". We became instant celebrities as a small mob formed. They took pictures of us. And they offered us water, apples, and sandwiches; we topped off our water bottles and I accepted an apple. It is the 1st one I have eaten in over a month given my dental issues! There were a lot of day hikers and weekend campers so we spent time being trail ambassadors. Budget, always the youth educator, provided a group of young ladies information about the NC skyline of mountains they were viewing. The last 2 miles of the day were the best terrain to hike, as the sun set. John met us about a mile from the trailhead; he had his headlamp on but we had not gotten ours out yet. A half moon and Venus illuminated the sky and I observed some clouds that looked like a sword. Now that we have completed this section of mile 1670.8 to 1696.1, our actual miles are aligned back with the guidebook so we are actually at 1719.

They are hiking back to the hostel they stayed at, Top of Georgia hostel. He had to get new shoes, a beanie, and gloves. He said today he was pleasantly surprised by the shoes (Salamons, 13 but not wides) He was able to spread the laces wide to relieve tightness and get his foot out of the toe box.They started at Unicoi Gap this morning. At 4:45pm he let me know they slack packed 16 miles NOBO to Dick's Creek Gap.

Budget never took his jacket off, and I only had my gloves off for 2 short periods. The last 6 miles were rockier than the previous 31 miles.

So, Buffalo and Budget are heading back to the AT (this time as NOBOs). You might remember there were some miles the ATC blocked because of the fires in 2016. So, they are going to knock those out over the next couple of weeks. They also have a new crew member joining them - Gyrene - a longtime friend, and Buffalo's neighbor. The plan is ~170 miles in a couple of weeks, starting in GA and heading north into the Smokies.Buffalo and Budget warmed up by checking out Trail Days in Damascus this weekend.

They reached Wayah Bald tower at 2:30 pm and Buffalo and Budget got to camp at Cold Spring Shelter about 5:30pm. They are hoping to tent camp this evening.
The mileage is definitely an estimate based on the shelter locations and a start near Winding Stair gap at Hwy 64. I'm not sure its right though!

Around 2pm he texted and said they had gotten to Sassafras Gap and were gonna keep going. That would have been 6.9 miles for the day, so they definitely put in the miles today.
They got to the Stecoah Gap and were off the trail at 5:55pm. This gap is right on the road. I think there are some blister issues in the group, but dad says they are pushing through it and had a good foot soak Saturday night.

This morning they started Jacob's Ladder a little after 9am. This is a pretty steep section of trail - 0.6 mile hike with a 600 ft ascent (no switchbacks).
I believe they've completed over 80 miles of the 170 they had planned, not to mention all the elevation. I think Budget and Buffalo are hiking/camping with some through-hikers; dad mentioned one hiker named Tulsa yesterday. Its a busy weekend in the NC mountains, so I am sure there are lots of folks around. It can definitely be a blessing to pass others and have them encourage you when they pass. 
Hope everyone has a safe weekend!

We have been keeping an eye on the weather and decided not to hike Tuesday. We took Tulsa to the NOC, and retrieved Budget’s truck from Hiawassee. We spent time seam sealing our tent flies since we both have had leaks recently. 
Interestingly, co-workers have a meeting in TN on Tuesday. I’m working out the details for shuttling Budget's car to the TN state line and going to the meeting.

I think they also helped shuttle for Band-Aid (a NOBO hiker). They were still staying at Wolf Creek and have been treated soo well there.
