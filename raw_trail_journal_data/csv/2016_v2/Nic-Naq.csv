Nic-Naq,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/446410,"Just ended up talking to a few buddies of mine i met in 2012 on the AT and hiked with til i ended up leaving once i hit Fontana Dam, that they plan on hiking the AT in 2016. I am really excited right now. I can not wait to hike with them again. It's funny too only because we used to have ""Gazing Parties"". What are gazing parties you might be wondering? Well, when we used to take breaks we ended up taking a seat on the path and looking out onto the mountains and enjoy the scenery. We did this quite a few times along the trail. We had some amazing times together. This is some great news for me. I am looking forward to spending time back on the trail and once again enjoy the serenity around me.",,Great News...,"Mar 26, Wed",0
Nic-Naq,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/446497,"Well i had the 2012 Nobo AT guide by Awol and it really didnt do much for me. To be honest i think it was a waste of money in my opinion. I mean all you really had to do was follow the white blazes. When i hiked earlier this year before the injury on the trail i pretty much burned the book and followed the whites. They say you need it but honestly you do not. I am not going to purchase one next year and save that $15 for a resupply in the town for some food. Anything to make a buck i say. I mean i have hiked to Fontana Dam with no problem and trust me when i say this, you will be hiking with someone at some point on the trail that is carrying one. Just follow them. lol. Also save the extra grams/ounces in your pack for something else or nothing at all. the lighter your pack the more comfortable you will be. It's funny how people tell me about the weight of their pack and how light or heavy it is. This is the thing, it weighs a lot when you have all your clothing and gear packed in it. But you know that when you put on your clothing that the pack is the actual weight after all that? All you need in your pack is your sleeping bag, tent, food, water and whatever clothing you might need. you add all that up as your total pack weight i'm telling you its going to be extremely light. I made the mistake of lugging extra food and clothing for no reason whatsoever. 2016 i am going pretty light and stomping some major miles.",,whatever...,"Mar 26, Wed",0
Nic-Naq,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/452538,Looks like i will be Thru-Hiking in 2016 instead of 2015. Making the decision to do so only to be able to save more money in the process. Since i have been off the trail this year due to my injury i ended up selling most of my gear but in the process i ended up by UltraLite gear. I don't plan on exceeding over 15lbs including food and water. I figure it will lighten the load on my back and on my legs. Also i will be able to bang out more miles per day. see you guys out there!,"Update!

Nic-Naq,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/461210,"So my leg healed 100% a few weeks back and since then i have been hitting the gym. Been watching what i eat and been running about 5-7 miles a day. When i got off the trail in March i think i weighed about 253 lbs. Today i was weighed by my trainer and I'm down to 232 lbs. I told him about my return hike in 2016 and he was pumped. Told me that he would provide me with mail drops of goodies along the way and that he is looking forward to my entries. I figure by the time i hit the trail again i should be at my goal weight of 190 lbs. But as far as my leg injury goes, I am doing great...","

Nic-Naq,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/462006,So i ended up selling a lot of the new gear i had purchased but i felt uncomfortable in them so i ended up purchasing some new items and i have to say is wow. Marmot really knows how to make some of the most comfortable clothing on the market. I was ok with The North Face at first but a buddy of mine knew i was wanting something different so he pointed me to Marmot and i fell in love. So for my 2016 Thru Hike i will be wearing Marmot mostly. Why? they are comfortable as fuck for me. Great products!,"

Nic-Naq,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/471768,"Just keeping up with my Journal since it's been awhile. I ended up deciding to start my new journey in April of 2016 instead of March. i figure with the crowds and the much warmer climates i can tag along with a few fellow hikers. That way when danger lurks i am surrounded by the fellow man. So whom ever is leaving early April of 2016 on the AT, let me know.",,Today!,"Aug 26, Tue",0
Nic-Naq,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476588,"Just counting the days til i hit the trail. Wish it was just a few months away but in reality it's i still have over 500 days to go. As i look online to see if i can switch out the current gear i have with lighter gear seems to be the norm for me every freaking day. I even had a dream the other night that i was hiking in just only a pair of underwear and trekking poles while everyone was just looking at me laughing. I seem to be carrying a cub bear on my back that could speak and he just kept on telling me not to worry that we will make it to the very end. Weird huh? I figure that this time around when i do step back on the trail that i will be more physically and mentally prepared. I have been prepared before but not this time around. I think i am more excited that i will be hiking for a reason more than just hiking to get away. My reason for this hike is not for anyone but myself. I hiked in the past for my son and it only took me so far. Though i did get hurt i think it was just suppose to happen to me. Telling me that i needed to get off and try later in the future. My friends keep telling me that i should just leave it alone and stay home. I love adventure, i can't see myself staying home and working 9-5 and not hiking the trail. Even some people ask why not hike next year? I tell them that i figure that 2016 i will be more prepared and that i have a plan. I will def be hiking a lot lighter than i have in the past. I think i should be right under 17lbs which includes water and food.","

Nic-Naq,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476991,"I keep on getting family members asking me everyday why i keep on trying to thru-hike the A.T. when i have failed in the past. 1: Because i want to be the first person in the family to accomplish such a feat and then move on to the next big hike, possibly the PCT or the CDT immediately after the AT. 2: I love to hike and enjoy what nature have to offer. 3: Just Because i can and i will. 2016 will be the year for me and i have nothing holding me back as i accomplish this feat. Not only to prove them wrong but to in a polite way rub it in their face... I'm not really like that though. I just want to be able to hike the entire trail and look back and say, ""phew, that was one ass kicking trail"".","home

Nic-Naq,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480191,"First off i just want to wish everyone a Happy New Year. So my status as of right now is that i will be hiking the A.T. as a thru-hiker starting March 1st of 2016. I was going to start it on a later date but convinced my hiking partner that we should take off on that date only to avoid traffic and congestion on the trail itself. That getting out there before the large crowds so we can bang out some miles per day. I have been on the trail a few times and it seems like that i do small amounts of miles but that is only because i hike alone. I figured if i hike with one or more but not exceeding 3 or 4 hikers we can set a nice pace to bang out those miles and get to a certain destination a lot quicker. Don't get me wrong, but at the same time enjoy nature as we embark on this path. I made the mistake in the past by taking trips into a resupply town for food and liking the town and ending up taking the rest of the day off and getting a hotel room. Kinda takes the fun out of hiking the trail and at times i wonder if i should even go back on the trail and find a way to get back home and just quit. I think i am not gonna spend too much time in one town while hiking. Resupply and gone. For me i like to wake up really early right before the sun breaks through the mountains. That way i can get my things packed and my breakfast ready for consumption so i can fuel up for the long hike to the next spot to sleep at. I am not sure on how many miles per day i will be hiking. My guess would probably be 12-15 per day that's if my hiking partner (s) are up for the task. Yes i will be doing some night hikes. No i will not be taking a ton of zero days. I think the only time i will want to take consecutive days off is when i get to PA and NY. All together i think this time around will be much more enjoyable only because i am hiking with someone i know and at the same time keeping an eye on only because his family requested that i do so. I will be taking a ton of pics also. I took pics along the way of my section and attempted thru-hike but those were just of some spots. This time around i think i will be taking a ton of them so that way as my time on earth gets shorter with age i have something to look back on and share with my family and share the stories of my hiking adventure on the Appalachian Trail and any other trail i hiked after the A.T. I also made a few changes to my gear and my trail name as well. Reason for the name originally was to honor my son's nickname but i needed to let it go because i myself needed closure with that specific name. I will always love my son and will be thinking about him along the way. I am not sure if i will name myself or just wait til i get some miles on the trail and have someone give me one. All i know is that NiqNaq will not be used for the trail. As for gear. Well i just went with lighter equipment only because i feel if i got lighter i can be able to hike longer distances without struggling with the amount of weight i have to lug around on my back and at the same time relieve the pressure i will be applying on my knees. So my gear is going to be as light as possible but at the same time will be smart about the gear i take along the trail with me. Last few hikes i think i over did it and i ended up getting hurt on the trail. This time around i will be more prepared and a lot smarter as far as gear goes. Still not sure if i will be hiking in pants or shorts. i may just use my stretch pants that i run in and wear a pair of shorts over it and do that. i mean i have rain pants that i can use also that are insulated to where i can use them as regular hiking pants or just rain pants. Still debating on that. I will be be hiking as a minimalist on the trail but to the point that i will be warm enough to enjoy the cold days on the A.T. I can't believe in less than 13 months i will be back on the trail once again. I am looking forward to seeing the spots on it that i have hiked before and at the same time making new memories along the way. I will be keeping a journal by my side and pictures/videos of my journey. Make new and life long friends as well. Share stories along the way and at the camp sites. Why can't it be 2016 now? lol",,View Entry,"Jan 14, Wed",0
Nic-Naq,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/487190,"It's been a few month's since i last made an entry and well i have been a bit busy. I am looking forward to meeting everyone on the trail once 2016 roll's around. can't wait to step back on the trail and hopefully with no set backs that i can hike the entire trail. I do have a busy year this year with all the traveling to see family and weddings to attend. If that wasn't the case i would be on the trail this year instead of next. But at the same time i get to put away and save money that i need for the trail. I had to get rid of a lot of old gear i had for the simple fact that i want to get on the trail itself with lighter gear. i know my hiking buddy Nate is packing a lot but i am trying to convince him to pack light so that we can bang out 15-20 mile days after the first 2 weeks on the trail. The first 2 weeks will be 8 mile days maybe 10 to start off just to get our hiking legs in order. I think after the smokies we will be doing 15-20 mile hikes. Should be fun, even though we won't be alone out there.",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Tue",0
