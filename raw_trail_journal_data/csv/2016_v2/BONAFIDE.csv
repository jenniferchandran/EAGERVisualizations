BONAFIDE,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523801,A couple weeks ago I decided I was bored with work and needed a break. The best place for me to take a break is hiking on the Appalachian Trail. It always makes me feel better to get in shape and spend a little time in the Appalachian Mountain. So here I am again on Amtrak heading to Springer Mountain but this time I'm not alone. I had to switch trains in New York City and as I was waiting I noticed somebody walking by with a backpack on so I went up to her and I said are you going to Springer Mountain and she said yup. It was a lot of fun to have somebody to talk to about hiking. When we got to Philadelphia another hiker came on and then there was three of us. This year I'm going to hike the trail in a different way. I'm going to throw in alternative routes on my way north like the Benton McKay Trail in Smoky National Park and the Iron Mountain Trail outside of Damascus. Once I make it up to that Sharondoah National Park I think I'm going to try that Aqua blaze from Waynsboro to Harpers Ferry. It involves renting a canoe and paddling down the Sharondoah river. I'm thinking my next hobby adventure will involve a canoe so this will be the big test to see if I like it or not.  I'm going to finish this up by saying that this hike should be a lot of fun seeing that I've only managed to do 2 miles of pre-hiking.,"

BONAFIDE,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523804,Day one started out beautifully. The sky was blue the sun was bright and the day was warm I was in heaven. When I made it to Justin creek campground there was a fire going. Not the best idea to leave a fire going and walk away but I was happy to have a fire and kept it going. Before I knew it lunch became dinner and I was setting up my tent for the night. I was just so happy to be in the woods it didn't matter that I only did like 3 miles. The next day I made it to Neels gap and counted 20 thru-hikers there. That was when I started to think that the trail was a little crowded this year but it really sunk home when I got to Low Gap shelter and there was well over 20 people there. When you leave Low Gap shelter the trail follows a old road through the woods for about 2 to 3 miles where it turns off to the left and goes up over a hill but the road continues on and I happen to notice this time that there was still a trail there so I said what the heck I think I'll take the trail less traveled. I am so glad I did because the trail turned into a fire road that turned into another fire road and about 8 or 9 miles later I ended up downtown Helen. All the sign said that it was Chattahoochee wildlife management area and I had the whole place to myself. It was such a great day and I didn't even have to keep looking over my shoulder to see if somebody was hiking behind me. I was going to go into Helen Georgia because they were calling for rain and snow and a whole bunch of crap I didn't really want to deal with. Well time to go eat some ice cream I can do that now without any guilt .,"Woody Gap

BONAFIDE,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523822,"Helen was great especially when I was watching the snow coming down outside my hotel room. Got going a little late the next day ended up at the trail around noon. I started hiking with about an inch or two fresh snow which kinda reminded me of last year. It made the trail a little bit muddy and slippery but it was still ok for hiking. When I got to the shelter there was only one other person there and I decided what the heck I'll stay here too. The other hiker said that everybody from Blue Mountain shelter went to town so I thought it would be ok to stay there. Just before sundown I started to realize that it was not a good idea to stay there as hikers started to come in. It got so bad that there was no more space at all and people had to keep hiking on. Even after dark people kept coming in so I just put in my earplugs and rolled over and thought damn I wish I wasn't there.I have never seen this number of people trying to hike the trail. The next day I made it to deep gap and I found a great camping spot way off to the side and set up. Everybody I met said that they were going into town so I thought it would be a little safe to hang back because I wasn't going to go in. But again as the night went on more people just kept coming and coming. It was a good group of people and I did sleep well. The next day when I got to Dick's Creek gap there was a guy there that said hi you need a ride I said sure and off to town I went. I just thought of it as a sign and why not. In the morning when I went down for breakfast I noticed that there were seven hikers there and there are two other places that hikers stay in town and all I could think of is if there's that many people around that this trail is just too crowded for me. So I had to come up with a plan B and that involved calling enterprise to come pick me up. So the guy said sure he will be there in a half an hour what type of car do you want I said cheap. Well I should've probably gave it a little more thought because they showed up in a mini Cooper for me to rent. If you don't know what a mini Cooper is it's probably the smallest car on the road today. I'm a big guy and it was a lot of fun trying to get in and out of that car but one good thing I can say about that car is it was great on gas mileage. It was less than $20 for a fill up. So I was hoping to drive up the Blue Ridge Parkway for fun. That is one of the things on my bucket list to do and it could've been a good time to get it done but the parkway was closed near Asheville,NC for tunnel repair. So in the end I ended up just driving to Damascus,VA.","Helen, Ga

BONAFIDE,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523828,Damascus was great I was finally able to ride to a bike on the Creeper trail. The Creeper trail is a 17 mile bike path that's about a 4% down grade. There's nothing better to make you feel good about yourself than riding a bike down hill. Most of it is just coasting along with just a little bit of peddling at the bottom nothing very hard. The whole thing only cost $29. I wanted to do it again but my butt didn't really want to do it again. When I hiked out of Damascus I took the Iron Mountain Trail which is the old Appalachian Trail before they moved it over to Grayson Highlands. It turned out to be a fantastic trail. I really thought I was going to have it all along but on my first night five people came into camp. They were awesome people to hang out with we had a great time they were only out for an overnight. The next two days I had it to myself but then bumped into some people at hurricane Mountain shelter. The amount of people on the trail now or is just right not too crowded but not completely alone just how I like it. I'm taking a break at the relax in now and I see that they're calling for snow in a couple days so I'm thinking I might have to think of a Plan B again who knows. That's it for now.," Damascus, Va

BONAFIDE,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526640,A lot has happened since my last entry been really busy out here having lots of fun. I went from Akins to Pearisburg and had really nice weather. It was cold and a little wet rain in there in the middle but really really nice. I met A couple other hikers but mostly I had to myself just the way I like it. When I got the Pearisburg I talk to hiking friend of mine who said he was starting in Harpers Ferry West Virginia and said yada come up and hike with me. So that's what I did I called enterprise got a car and started driving north. First I actually drove east over to the Blue Ridge Parkway and then I went north up Parkway to the Skyland Drive. What a fantastic Road it's the one Road in America I never driven on because it's a no trucks allowed road. Lucky for me the big Meadows Campground just open that day and I was able to camp there in Sharondoah national Park. So when I got to Harpers Ferry I met up with Ramblin Man my buddy and we started hiking south the weather could not been any better we had a great time except for one situation. We had a storm come through in the middle of the night that had 60 mile an hour winds and it was pretty intense there for a while with trees and branches falling. It didn't last long and in the morning it actually snowed. When we try to hike out of front Royal it was 21Â° with a pretty good amount of wind and that is too cold for my system right now so I had to go back to town because I was way way too cold but I'll catch up to Ramblin man sometime tomorrow. Well the sun is out I better get going and stay tuned because I got some real fun adventure lined up for later,"Akins, VA
