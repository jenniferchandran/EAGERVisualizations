Trail Wing,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/398698,"Welcome to my debut journal entry. I live in Gettysburg and have hiked some of the local AT this month. Most definitely I have the White Blaze fever. When I'm out there I just have a hard time stopping (or in my case turning around to get back to my car)... About 10 years ago, when I lived in Lancaster, PA, I thought about hiking the Trail and did some research but it never got past that stage. Guess I just wasn't ready then.But this is a new stage, a new chapter in my life book, and the time might just be right. Two years ago I decided to go back to school in a competitive clinical program and I graduate in May 2013. I have a milestone birthday coming up next year and now is the time to do some soul searching. I'm already thinking about spending my Spring Break in March hiking a small portion of the Springer Mountain area before heading back to finish up school.Many things I think about actaully starting the AT journey. Do I have it in me? What will I learn about myself? Who will I meet out there? What adventures await me along the way???",,Thinking Stages,"Jan 18, Fri",0
Trail Wing,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/398982,"I can't get out on a thru-hike just yet, so I'm logging miles hiking the local sections of the AT. I'll fill you in on my thoughts as I go. Most of these local hikes will be round trip from parking lot to destination (usually a shelter) and back to the car. Most likely my hiking companions will be my boyfriend (aka Speedmonkey) or my dog Miley. I still haven't quite worked up the nerve to go hiking completely alone...For this trip I was with Speedmonkey. The weather was foggy and cold, but I was full of energy so I encouraged him to go out for a hike with me even though he wasn't feeling too great. We weren't sure where to go, so we thought we would check out this section from Rt 16 (PA) south toward Maryland. We got out up the trail and began to notice that there wasn't any fog on the trail at all. Perfect for a hike. Hiked til we reached the top, played on some rocks as the sun even made an appearance, then headed back to the car.After returning home, and deciding we weren't done yet, we headed back out to walk from Rt 16 (north this time) to Deer Lick Shelter. Another great hike. I had never been on the AT before so was curious to see what the shelters were like. I didn't know about the registers at this point, so I didn't look to see if there was one there or not.A great introduction to the AT",,Deer Lick Shelter,"Jan 20, Sun",4.20
Trail Wing,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/399134,Had off school for Martin Luther King Jr Day and the weather is cold (28 degrees) but I'm heading out for a hike with Miley anyway. Poor Speedmonkey had to work today. We arrived at the Caledonia parking area and took to the trail. Of course the first part is what seems to me to be straight up. This section of trrail follows the ridge of the South Mountain range. Once we got up there the views were great. The trail moves in and out of some rocky areas along teh ridge and it kept it interesting for us.We passed alot of other day hikers out there with their canine family too. Miley was in heaven everytime she saw another dog (we're a one dog family so she doesn't get to socialize much). We made it to Rocky Mtn Shelter in good time and hiked down to check it out then began our journey back. My fingers were just starting to get cold as we arrived at the parking area - I'll have to get a better pair of gloves.Total trip miles - 6.6,,Caledonia (South) to Rocky Mtn Shelter,"Jan 21, Mon",0
Trail Wing,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/398793,"Yes, it snowed in PA. Not a lot of snow, but some. Did I let it stop me from hiking? I don't think so. Out I went with Speedmonkey on Sunday afternoon. The air was crisp but pleasant and everything was covered in a fluffy white. We walked for about a mile, mostly downhill. We hadn't really looked at the maps before we went though, so I wasn't sure how far the next shelter was or how far we had hiked. I'm guessing we went about a mile and decided to head back (mostly uphill). It was a great workout.
I received the copies of A Walk in the Woods (read it before but wanted a refresher) and AWOL on the Appalachian Trail (never read this but it sounds good). Can't wait to get started.",,Parking area on Rattlesnake Run Rd,"Jan 27, Sun",2
Trail Wing,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/399361,"Awesome! School just got cancelled because it was icy and temps were low. But it's warming up and not raining (roads are no longer icy) so I'm heading out. I have my trusty companion Miley with me and we're hiking the section of PA trail from Caledonia State Park north to Quarry Ridge Shelter, which is a good 5 mile roundtrip hike.Of course, either way you start out from Caledonia seems like it's straight up, lol. I keep thinking to myself, I get a little winded and go slow on these ascents and technically these are really just hills compared with the real mountains found both to the south and north of us. How am I ever going to make it? Can I make it? How determined am I? I can't answer those questions right now, except to say - I feel drawn to this trail, and compelled to at least try. What makes me think I have the resolve that so many others don't have? I don't know, but I have to try.The sad thing is I keep trying to figure out how I can fit in a total thru-hike, but I'm not coming up with a great strategy. I may be one that has to just be satisfied with section hiking.Anyway, back to this hike. I just read the part in A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson where he talks about PA sections of the AT and I'm not sure if he's telling the truth about most hikers not liking PA or not. Can he make that judgement for the whole? I happen to love the PA section. Maybe because I have always lived in PA and got used to the rocks along time ago. Along my hike today I saw beautiful rock steps and the recent snow/ice only added to the elegance. Miley and I walked through tunnels of Mountain Laurel and areas of well manicured trail that were refreshing even though the day was misty and cold. I left my first ever trail entry in the registry at Quarry Mountain Shelter. Jim the ""Innkeeper"" has done a superb job making this shelter as welcoming and homey as possible, from the gate with teh great country welcome to the potted plants (even though it is still technically winter and the potted plants didn't look alive) I could envision what it must be like to walk up to this hidden bounty in the woods after a grueling day (week/weeks/months) of hiking. 
And another thing Mr Bryson, if I ever get to my thru-hike I for one will look forward to Pine Grove Furnace and the ""unofficial midway point"" of the Appalachian Trail. I hope I don't see things through your eyes when you reach the mid-point and feel that you haven't accomplished anything. For to me, even getting to that point will be possibly the greatest thing I have ever done and will be farther than what did you say, 3/4 of the hopefuls that don't even make it past Neels Gap... And I will have most definitely earned my half gallon of ice cream at Iron Masters Mansion!
Okay, I see i'm on another tirade. Point is, I enjoy PA AT! It may not have the vistas that other parts of the trail have but it's striking in its own way - you just have to be open to seeing it. Which I am.",,Caledonia (North) to Quarry Ridge Shelter,"Jan 28, Mon",0
Trail Wing,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/398792,"Beginning to think about what gear I'll need and where I'm gonna get it from. The list seems long, but in reality it's not a lot of stuff at all. My first trip will be a week in mid-March during my spring break from school.
Got my tent: Sierra Designs Vapor Light 1; 2 lb 14 oz Packed Weight. Just got this in the mail and Hot Dang is it ever light! Bye Bye to the days of camping with heavy tents that are better set up in a campground by your car. I have freedom at last. Okay Okay, there are more things I need to gather before I hit the open trail.
Just finalized the purchase of a Marmot Gore-tex Minimalist Rain Jacket. I love this jacket! It is feather light and fits like a glove. Have yet to try it out in actual rain, and hoping to heck that it doesn't let me down.
The most important item, naturally, is the backpack. After reading some other trailjournals and seeing what everyone else is using, I think I'm going to try out the ULA Catalyst. I loved this website and the very informative videos ULA provided (probably not all that helpful for more experienced hikers, but for a beginner like me they had a lot of useful info). In my research I read an article on sleeping bags that helped explain all the terminology in a clear manner. I decided to go with a DriDown bag, but haven't picked a specific model out yet. Also looked at Trekking Poles and picked out the Komperdell C3 Carbon Compact Powerlock Women's poles. These three items will have to wait until I get some money saved up.
I'm so excited to be checking things off of this list - if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know...",,Minding My Gear,"Jan 29, Tue",0
Trail Wing,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/399358,"We just went there to browse, get an idea of pack sizes and feel, check out sleeping bags and a few other things I don't have much experience with. Got to look through the sleeping pad section and was pretty impressed with the Thermarest Prolite and the Thermarest Neoair XLite. I can't believe how lightweight some of this stuff is. But I have to keep in mind that all the little things add up.I'm also starting to wonder how and what I'm going to eat out on the trail. So we perused the instant meal section and took a peak at the stoves. I really liked the style of the Jetboil Zip cooking system. Sounds like it heats water quickly and uses a lot less fuel. At this point I'm thinking my main meals will consist of peanut butter (for protein), granola bars, and the Lipton 10-minute rice/noodle packets. I'm not sure how those packets will cook up in one of these campstoves, but guess I'll find out.",,To Gander Mountain!,"Feb 05, Tue",0
Trail Wing,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/399708,"So I went for a hike today with Speedmonkey. He wanted to help get me in shape so I'm completely ready for anything the AT can throw so he took me to a local trail called Wild Cat Rocks. Pennsylvania is known for its rocky terrain and this trail didn't disappoint. I had been on this trail before but still had a great time. We walked/climbed deliberately and before I knew it we were on the tallest rock. Views were pretty amazing. Of course, instead of seeing a mountain range we could look 360 degrees in all directions - viewing Whitetail Ski Resort to the west and Ski Liberty to our east.Anyway, Speedmonkey climbs with ease, literally climbing circles around me, but I went with the mantra ""slow and steady gets me to the goal"" and we had a great time. And while we were up there I think we discovered some big cat tracks in the snow on some of the rocks. So exciting, I'm sure they were around and probably watching us as we hiked and climbed.",,Wild Cat Rocks,"Feb 10, Sun",0
Trail Wing,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/399895,"I just got the dates for my two remaining board exams. It's not looking good for me to thru-hike this year, so maybe I'll section hike what I can and join the Class of 2014 thru-hikers. The dates for my board exams are May 29th and June 20th. I suppose I could do a Southbound hike, but for me it seems like more of a tradition to end at Katahdin. Maybe section hiking is the answer for me, at least for now.Still up in the air about it...",,2013 or 2014?,"Feb 16, Sat",0
Trail Wing,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/400159,"Within the last week or two I have received my Marmot rainjacket, the Sierra Designs Vapor Light 1 tent, and my Komperdell Trekking Poles. I think all of these have been sound choices so far. The tent I have set up in the living room 3 times. I still need to practice and become more efficient in setting up the tent, and I'm really starting to wonder how I'm going to manage putting it up and not getting the inside totally soaked if I happen to set up in a rainstorm.Today I purchased a pair of Patagonia Capilene Base Layer Pants and a Capilene Crew top from Moosejaw. If there is a better site to get hiking gear - somebody please let me know. At least they had decent sale prices and I was overall pleased with the sale. Now I can't wait to get the outfot and see if I picked the correct sizes. I wish there were more outfitters near me so I could just try the stuff on first.I want to go hiking locally, but I find I keep throwing excuses like the weather is terrible, etc. Then I feel bad, because I shouldn't let the weather stop me. I'm sure I'll hit snow, rain, and cold temperatures somewhere along my route on the AT.I'm still not sure what I'm going to do about the thru-hike vs section hike, since I'll have to start so late, but I definitely am planning to get out for a trial run on my Spring Break in March. I'm thinking of starting at Route 30 in Caledonia (Pennsylvania) and either heading North or South and just keep walking until the end of the week. This will give me an idea of what to expect and how many miles per day my body can handle.",,Accumulating Gear,"Feb 20, Wed",0

Trail Wing,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/400702,"My sleeping bag and jetboil Zip stove have arrived and I ordered my ULA Circuit backpack and the Thermarest sleeping pad today! My prep hike starts in exactly one week. I can't wait and I pretty much plan to hit the AT at Rt 16 in Blue Ridge Summit, PA and head south from there. I have a week for Spring Break so I guess it'll be a good test to see how far I get.News Update:I started a new blog that you can reach directly at www.trailwing2013.blogspot.com I like Trailjournal, but I wanted a better way to connect pictures with my individual posts and for my readers to leave comments. Check it out when you have a chance. Well, it's getting late and I have class tomorrow, until next time...
Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention - I made a trip to the local REI (for me that's Timonium, MD) last weekend and picked up some small items. What a great store to browse! I made that venture with Papa Bear (Speedmonkey's dad). We must have been looking around for at least 2 hours...",,Prep Hike in One Week,"Feb 28, Thu",0
Trail Wing,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/401713,I received my Circuit backpack on Friday and have been loving it ever since. it took me no time at all to get all my gear inside and there is still a lot of room left for food and water. I'm going on my practice hike starting tomorrow. I love all the extras on this ULA pack opposed to other packs I've tried. The handhold straps give me something to do with my hands while I'm hiking and helps take weight off of my shoulders. I did a great job with my measurements and the pack fits like a glove.I'll add a pic when I get one...,,Ready to go!,"Mar 10, Sun",0

Trail Wing,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516806,"Some background: 2 yrs ago I planned on doing a section hike from PA (Rt 16) to Harper's Ferry and failed miserably. Although I had read many articles/journals regarding not doing too much too soon and taking care of your feet, the messages just didn't hit home. I guess I just have to learn things the hard way. I thought I had comfortable shoes... I thought I had the good socks... I thought I was cross trained and physically able to handle the stresses of the trail. You may have already figured this out, but boy, was I ever wrong. I managed to make it 11 miles (up High Rock and on through to MD Rt 77) before calling for Plan B. Plan B was my bf picking me up and bringing me home with my ""tail between my legs"". I was beat and as bad as my feet and legs hurt I barely walked for the next 3 days. I fell into a depression (that I completely denied for the next 2 yrs). I gained weight (actually gained back 55 pounds that I had previously lost), lost interest in exercising and basically felt like I was a failure. So my pack and supplies got stuck in a corner until late summer/fall 2015. I decided I finally had enough toward the end of August. My depression has come to an end and I once again feel drawn to the AT. I believe I definitely learned my lesson about doing too much too soon the ""newbie"" way, despite everything I read and having the experience of small hikes on the trail in my local area.Since coming back from my slump a couple of months ago, I have started day hiking the Trail spreading out north and south from my local area. At times I had to back track to my vehicle the same way I had come, at other times I hiked back following roads, and when I can bum rides/shuttles from family I took advantage of that option. On Halloween Oct 31st, I reached a few milestones... I have now hiked just over 100 miles of the Trail via day hiking. I have covered ground from just south of Duncannon, PA and completing the last 10 miles ending in Harper's Ferry this past Saturday, Halloween. I know Maryland is a short state but I have officially completed hiking through it! It's an accomplishment for me. And what a great day to check out the Outfitter at the General Store there, as well as the ATC Headquarters. I picked up a few things at each of these places!To aid in my day hikes I visited REI and picked up an Osprey daypack and a 2L hydration bladder, along with a couple of other helpful items (including a pair of midrise Salomon boots. I will add items to my gear list so I won't go into likes/dislikes here.I'm treating all of these day hikes as training for a someday thru-hike. I hope to push myself, but slowly with logical steps. I am planning on moving from day hikes to short overnighters and longer section-hikes, as time and work allow. A thru-hike attempt is definitely in my future!Anyway, thanks for reading. More to come soon! Any feedback and/or suggestions are always appreciated!","AT
