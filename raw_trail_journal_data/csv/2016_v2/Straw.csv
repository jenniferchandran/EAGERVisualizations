Straw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493025,"A thru hike is something I've thought about on and off for many years. Will there ever be a good time to take 6 months out of my life? No. Going on that premise, I am taking the time from my business, family, and friends and just go.  It will impact all aspects, but I feel in the long run it is the right time. My son will be going with me. He will turn 17 while on the trail. I would have done it solo, but this could be an adventure that maybe a unique growth experience he may never have the opportunity to experience otherwise.

I'm an experienced hiker with no illusions that the path is smooth, the weather always comfortable, the insects friendly. 

The pic is from trip to the Snow Range in Wyoming in April for camping and snowshoeing. We were above 10,000 feet so there was lots of snow.

Straw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493147,"Of the family and friends we have told they are all supportive and a bit surprised, naturally. Not that I would take a hiking trip, but the amount of time and distance involved. There is no easy way to discuss with your spouse that you want to spend 6 months away from home; and take one of your children along too boot. We took our daughter on her 1st camping trip as a baby. Here she is with me in the Snowy Range.",,View Entry,"May 07, Thu",0
Straw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493327,"One of a teenage boy's big life focus is food. When I first put a thru hike on the table the subject of food was high on the list of concerns. I explained that while we would carry most of what we consume, some would also be from eating in towns, some mail drops, and of course, some ""trail magic"".Current thinking is go with as little ""out to eat"" as possible. I know how quickly eating the same things can get really quickly, but ""out to eat"" should be a treat, not an expectation. I've eaten the same things day after day and know I can do it , but my son just hasn't had to experience that. We're working on finding the right combination of easy, high calorie, healthy, protein heavy, light-weight. But he will have to learn to adapt.Things tried so far like Korr packet meals are really awful. Doesn't seem to matter the brand/flavor, in 2 days they taste exactly the same and really bad.",,What to Eat,"May 08, Fri",0
Straw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511292,"Small mishap 2 weeks ago while working in the yard. It was getting late and came across a copperhead in the shrubs we wanted to work in. Decided it was prudent just to call it a day and let the snake have the area. I went to the other side of the house to turn off the water and was hit on the foot by another copperhead! Yes,I was wearing sandals. I could not believe it.... I have already killed 3 copperheads this season so I always look were I put my feet and hands. This one came out from under a water container. My foot must have scared it and was too close for its' comfort.Years ago I bought a snakebite kit to suck out the venom should I take a hit while out in the woods. I'll always remember my husband poo and pah it at the time. He just didn't see any need for it. That did a complete change now that it was needed and did it's job.Now the odds of a venomous snakebite in the US are really, really small. And I found out after spending 4 hours in the emergency room that most copperhead bites are dry (no venom injected). My strike felt like being injected with fire or stabbed by a hot knife, take your pick. It really was painful. The kit was able to pull a lot of blood and serum and I got to it within 5 minutes of the bite. The swelling was considered minor and I had no other major issues. In the end I had what looked like a wide bruise along half of my foot that was tender to the touch and actually tingled when I did touch it. Oh, and an estimated $6600 emergency room bill for a tetnus shot, blood draw, 5x to listen to my heart and lungs. After 3 hours I was ready to go, but they wouldn't release my for another hour since it was ""regs"" to keep me for 4 hours of observation. Can't wait for the final bill.So I don't really know if I got a dry bite, minimal bite, or the kit really worked. I am okay and healing fast. I'm back running with minimal discomfort.Two years ago I was out after dark hiking during the fall season bush wacking and felt something hit my boot. A small copperhead had struck my boot. They did their job and completely protected me. I had my kit with me then and was glad to have it even if I didn't need to use it.Which brings me to the question of whether I will have it with me on AT. No, I won't. Snakes work hard to avoid or warn people away from them. Hopefully, my quality time with poisonous snakes is done.",,Hazards inthe grass,"Aug 25, Tue",0
Straw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/511773,"Gear selection is winding down. All the major bits are done. Like many hikers I do the prerequisite research before buying anything. I am also not a big ""returner"". I have enough experience to know what should work and what won't. If I have a real question I find it in brick and mortar stores. I know REI is really popular because of their generous return policy, but I find their prices reflect that generosity, as it should. I do use them, but not often.Some things have to be used for a bit to see if will work out. A bra is one of those. I have bought several brands over the years trying to find the ""best"" one. They all have all had at least one major flaw that keeps me in the hunt. The fiber content must be mostly wool, nothing that bites or binds, and little to no polyester. Wool is for comfort and odor control. They have to have some nylon/spandex for durability and stretch. There is something in my chemistry that just doesn't work well with polyester. After a very short time I reek in it. It is really unpleasant and after a certain point it just won't wash out.I do have a polyester buff that I like with some sort of ""stay clean"" treatment on it. I'll see how long that works out.No bra is going to be perfect for everyone, but I have finally come across one with only minor issues rather than major. The Ibex bra (see gear list) is my current try out and seems to fit the bill. Enough support to be comfortable, smooth construction, high wool content, drys fast, no rub into your skin from the backpack, and not binding. It's amazing how many are like having a constricting band on your chest.I'll keep my other wool bras for day hikes and daily activity, but the Ibex goes on the AT.",,What's underneath,"Aug 28, Fri",0
Straw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/512629,"Current base weight is 15 lbs, sans food and water. I'm including the weight of the fuel I'll be using for cooking, but not the weight of the clothing I will wear on a regular basis. I'll keep tinkering, but it's not a bad base. I want to go light, but not stupid light. I read that comment in my research somewhere and it resonated with me.Saw the movie ""A Walk in the Woods"" today. I did read most of the book, but when Bryson dropped off the trail I stopped reading. Wasn't a bad movie. I'm not a Nolte fan so it looses points right off the gate for having him in it.   If I wasn't doing the AT next year I wouldn't have paid for a theater ticket. I would have waited for it to come out on DVD and checked it out from my local library for free. Will it create a big wave of new hikers? Content was light on the AT itself and very focused on the interaction between the main characters. Some nice scenes from the trail. I don't see the movie creating a wave of new hikers.",,Base Weight,"Sep 05, Sat",0
Straw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/513330,"Camping for me started with a tent. The tent got smaller and smaller with experience. I had issues with condensation and leaks. I also felt so trapped and cramped in my small tent. It took some of the spark out of camping/hiking. Then I went with a hammock. Love using it. Couple of downsides for me. Finding trees of appropriate size and distance apart and they are a 1.5 season use for me. I got really cold using it and spent some really uncomfortable nights.I couldn't imagine what 6 months in a tiny tent would be like or dealing with a hammock. Tarp seems the current winner. Light, open, requires no trees. Downside is a new closeness with nature. But, that aspect doesn't bother me. In fact, I love it.  Spent the weekend under my tarp in my backyard. Don't poo and pah the backyard experience. We back up to Core of Engineer land and a 20 minute walk from a lake. That means lots of wildlife and woods. 
Here a coyote came in from the woods to check out the chicken house one winter.

We have the full spectrum of visitors to our yard: fox, coyote, bobcat, wild pig, turkey, white tail deer, roadrunner, armadillos, racoons, opossums, skunks, various hawks, owls, bats, a nice variety of venomous and non-venomous snakes, and the occasional neighbor dog. I fear loose dogs way more than any local wildlife. Let's just say that cats and small dogs are not left outside at anytime, especially at night, or risk becoming an appetizer. 
A couple of years ago an armadillo made a den under our deck. The babies would come out in the evenings to explore. This one licked my toes.A front came in Friday night so I had a nice wind test. Found out that my tent skewers with the shepard hook weren't going to cut it. The hook was too shallow. They kept swiveling around and that allowed my rope to slide off. Annoying. I have spade stakes as well and they worked fine. Mosquitoes showed up in between the wind. That meant I spent quality time with the sleeping bag liner over my head. The light on my e-reader was a mosquito attractant. Who knew. Another visitor to my tarp while sleeping was the frog that leaped on my face. It surprised me, but didn't scare me. The family got a good laugh about that one when I recounted my adventures of the night.  Saturday I took a pair of needle nose pliers to the tent skewers and made real loops on them. That stopped the rope slide. Took a piece of no-seeum netting, 52x60 in, sewed a hem around the edge, slide in elastic to fit loosely around my upper shoulders. Then sewed on a loop on top so it would drape from the tarp roof if I need to get it off my face while reading in the sleeping bag. Worked perfectly on Saturday night. No mosquitoes singing in my ears.
This morning (Sunday) we had a turkey in the yard. Beautiful birds.

Straw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514232,"I've been on the lookout for an easy way to keep a simple sewing kit when I was looking at a rescue knitting kit made from a chapstick tube and it hit me that I could do the same for sewing.My upholstery thread has disappeared, but for some reason I have metallic embroidery thread in silver and gold. It seems pretty strong. So I made up a bobbin of gold and silver thread and popped it inside an empty chapstick tube along with a needle. I have enough room to add black upholstery thread later. I'll throw this into the 1st aid kit and be set.As I mentioned in my 1st post that my son will be going along with me. We aren't sharing anything so he has to carry his own way. So whatever you see in my gear list you can just double it up. Along with the dollars. This evening I told him I made him a sewing kit and his response was ""Do you want me to be excited about this?"" Hmmmmm.... I gave him the mom look and told him the appropriate response, at the minimum, is ""That will work, thanks Mom"". He mumbled through it and all was good.

Straw,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518173,"Spent this weekend with Logan to do a winter shakedown on gear and give Logan a taste of what is to come.The Witchita Mountain National Wildlife Refuge is a wonderful place in SW Oklahoma. Thousands of acres of wilderness with free roaming Bison and Long Horn Cattle, plus lots of elk and whitetail deer. Rugged mountains and boulder fields are popular with rock climbers and hikers. It is open daily to day use, but limits the overnight use to back country backpacking and only 10 permits at any one time and only for 3 day/2 night visits either Mon - Wed or Fri - Sun. This is great as it helps slow down the ""love a resource to death"" syndrome you see so much of in state and national parks. When trying to arrange my permits, every weekend I tried for was booked so I finally just asked him to tell me the next opening for 2. It was for 2 months later in early Dec. I told him I would take them. They are none refundable once paid. It was a big risk because of weather. The prior weekend was icey. This weekend was clear and sunny, but the wind, OMG, was relentless. With elevation and constant wind put us at lower 50's, feels like upper 40's during the day, and lower 30's (freezing), feels like mid to upper 20's, at night.The really great part of the place is that you enter on a trail, but can bushwack all over the area. The only real restriction is that you must camp in a specific area in the Charon Garden. We camped in different spots each night. The wind was so high, day and night, that we opted to just put up one tarp. The idea was for Logan to do his own, but circumstances changed our options. He still had to cook for himself, deal with his gear, and generally take care of himself.Our view on Saturday night included a bison herd in the distance. I didn't get a shot of them, but seeing the valley and mountain out the tarp was nice.I can't over state how rocky this place is. The closest training for us for the Appalachian trail is here. Right now there is water coming out of rocks and the ground, running and pooling, in many areas.We learned so much on this trip. I started with a 28.3 pounds and Logan with 26. I need to come up with another bag for the tarp.   The original packaging works fine if your putting it back in under perfect conditions. Wind at a constant 25 mph makes for a challenge. Logan has a better understanding about what I have told him to expect. He really enjoyed our time even though the wind howled day and night for the entire trip. It made sleeping in a tarp an adventure. I need to get more v stakes. They just have better holding power.I took too much in loose snacks. Turns out I prefer bars. So cut back on that. 
Sleeping bag system worked nicely other than I need warmer sleeping socks. I have wool ones, but I need to make angora ones. Angora is 7x warmer than wool, but lighter in weight. I'll make some this month. (I do my own blending and spinning to make yarn, as well as knitting.) I am dropping one of my wool shirts since I never used it this weekend and my wool hat. My hooded wool shirt, wool neck gaiter, and Keffiyeh scarf were more than enough for head protection in the cold and wind. RailRider shirt works fine on top of that with a wind shirt finishing it off for normal cold. The down vest was great for morning breakfast. Had to take it off before starting the hike as we warmed up quickly.Shoes, wool socks, pants, wool longjohn leggings, worked perfectly. No issues with blisters and such. I did fall once climbing Sunset Mountain. I was good until dry grass wrapped around my ankle. I was stepping forward, got wrapped up, weight of backpack pulled me forward so the ground came rushing up to me. I managed to twist to my side, tuck my chin, and pull my arms in. I managed to not bash my head on the rocks, slammed my left knee into a rock, and clipped my right pinkie. I also was very lucky to not hit any cactus. I think there was some elk droppings hidden in the grass as I seemed a wee bit more aromatic. Nothing fresh, but a definite hint. I missed my kneecap, hitting the bone just under it. Gave me a good scrap, small cut, and bruise through my pants and leggings. It smarted, but didn't stop the hike. I scared Logan because he thought I might have hit my head. Pinkie was the worst really, almost broken. The climbing gloves I use for protection stopped it from being broken at the 1st joint, but the 2nd joint was hyper-extended. It swelled up, but I kept moving it while climbing to keep the fluids moving. Being very cold weather helped as well. Both our backpacks worked well. I already put a hole in mine. I had just told Logan that in the event a pack gets away from us and starts to fall down a hill or mountain to let it go. We were eating lunch on top of a small outcropping of rocks. I was putting mine back on and sure enough, it got away from me and fell 10 feet before it lodged and stopped it's descent. As we watched it fall I told Logan I didn't really mean to give an actual demonstration. I climbed down and retrieved it. Nothing was damaged other than the small hole that was torn into it. My fault, not a quality issue.",,Witchita Mountain National Refuge,"Dec 06, Sun",0

My best gift were the roses my children gave me. Beautiful, smell great, and are lasting a long time. I would rather have them than more ""stuff"".Saturday a front line was predicted to come with lots of rain, wind, and cold. Perfect opportunity to set up the tarp in the backyard and spend the night. Opted to not set the sides all the way to the ground except at the entrance.   Wanted to see how much rain would drip back and what my real working ""dry"" space would be. Also, went with only stakes and walking poles for tie down. By late Saturday afternoon, the first sprinkles and wind began. It rained all night and all the next day. It varied from light to heavy. Most was moderate rain. The wind was roaring through the small ravine and in the trees behind our house most of the night. Had some thunder and lightening in the mix. One of which must of hit close as a blinding flash went off followed by thunder that shook the ground under me. Turns out 9 tornadoes came out of the storm and killed at least 8 in the neighboring towns.Learned a few things. Only one stake pulled so I was happy with them. I've got 3 different tie off lines and found that the thinnest lost their tension in the rain. Didn't have that issue in the Witchita Mtns trip. So while they are lighter I won't be using them. Condensation was not an issue. Had some misting issues, but minor. Foot box on the quilt got a little damp from dripping at one open end. That was caused when the stake pulled.
Did get my angora socks spun and knit. My feet were comfortable all night.   The sound of rain got to be pretty loud so I may consider ear plugs. Even with the noise of the rain I slept well. I stayed warm, mostly dry. and comfortable, and we ended up with 3.5+ inches of rain.",,Christmas Camp Out,"Dec 28, Mon",0

Some poor bird will be raising it's young in waste material of a human. It could have been the state songbird of Georgia for all I knew. If packing out your paper is too much effort then use the leaf litter, ferns, tree leaves, pines cones, etc... to clean up with. They do work.The ""x"" marks the spot of toilet tissue seems to mar some of the nicest spots. I even saw where it was left in a stream. Which means instead of being 200 yds from the water source, they were in it. Pathetic and totally not necessary.Spend the extra money and get a head lamp with the red beam. The intense lumens that LED lights now put out are obnoxious and intrusive. Don't sing in the mornings no matter how wonderful your voice is. Don't leave your food trash in the fire pits.

Met 2 SOBO's from NY. Started last year, took a break for the winter, and were mere weeks from finishing now. I warned them of the over abundance of poison ivy in GA and they told me Jacob's Ladder was over rated and not to sweat it.

Day is beautiful and sunny! The hike up is smooth and easy compared to the prior trails.Almost made it to the camp when I ran into my 1st bear. It wasn't on the trail, but close enough that I decided not to take pictures. I started singing/talking loudly, raising my sticks in the air to look bigger. It looked at me, kept eating, very relaxed. I kept walking slowly, watching and went into the Birch Spring Camp. I was met by Carl, a ridge runner in the Smokies. He asked about my backcountry permit and were I was heading. Birch is an open camp, no shelter, where every one is supposed to eat at the fire ring, not their sleeping area. 

Carl was camping/monitoring the area. While eating dinner a bear came down the ridge and had definite plans to join us at the fire ring. Carl jumped up, ran over and stared throwing rocks and shouting at it. It took a bit to convince it to leave, but it finally turned around. Two close encounters within 3 hours was plenty for me. 

Spent the 1st night in our hammocks. It was nice. A clear night with a breeze. Could hear rustling at the top of the ridge, so I assumed it was the bear, but it never bothered us in the night. 

Day 25
Hiked to Spencer Field on another beautiful day. Again terrain was fairly straight forward. This is not to say it was easy......just less roots, rocks and mud.   The trees here are magnificent, but it is apparent they are stressed.   The higher you go the more dead and dying. 

We arrived at the shelter to find empty food cans in the fireplace inside the shelter. A huge no-no! First off who is carrying cans, and then to leave them is wrong. 

Many who showed up at the shelter opted to set tents up at the horse corral area. Okay, that was their risk. By evening it was cool and windy. Most we're eating around the fire ring and some the edge of the shelter. One wanted to come directly in to eat and I told him no. They don't want food in the shelters as it draws bears. Two days after we left a bear bit a man through his tent. Derrick Shelter was already closed because a bear had gone into it with people present just days earlier.

Day 26
Hiked to Silers Bald Shelter today. Fogged in on some high points. Not a particularly exciting day, just the continued rise toward the highest point on the AT - Clingmans' Dome. 

Day 27
Almost went up to Clingman's Dome. Weather has been foggy at the tops of the ridges so views are pretty nonexistent. Been walking through clouds and mist. I walked up to the tower and decided not to climb the concrete tower. I went around a corner and saw the .5 mile asphalt paved walk to the visitor center and opted out of that too. There are a whole lot of tourists at the Dome. 

As I stood checking my map I heard a voice say: Look honey! It's a thru hiker....she's on the Appalachian Trail! I now felt like part of the exhibit. I turned around, smiled, answered a few questions. They were nice, but I was feeling a little weird around so many people. I slipped farther down the trail, tried checking the map again and heard: it's a statue! It's a forest! I just glanced over my shoulder, saw a large family group coming up the trail along with a large Japanese tourist group. I took off as fast as I could down the trail. Apparently I stood so still I looked like a statue. 

Spent the night at IceWater Spring Shelter. 

Day 28
We're running low on food and all the dead and downed trees is getting depressing. The trail is muddy and messy in a lot areas. We decide to make this our first 20+ mile day and pushed to Crosby Knob Shelter. It made sense since so much was down hill. 

Crosby Knob has been my worst shelter experience. I slept on the upper bunk. The guy next to me used a blue tarp zip tied together as a sleeping bag. When he turned over it sounded like I was inside a popcorn machine. I told Atlas this was the first shelter I could actually smell ""mouse"". Turns out it was this guy. Plus, he was urinating into a bottle during the night. I had to tell him to move back at some point in the night. The smell, sounds, and lack of respecting my personal space meant I woke with a headache. I had to take a Tylenol for the 1st time. In my head he will forever have the trail name ""Mouseman"". 

Had another close encounter with a bear. It came in to checkout some of the tents. They ran it out and it came in around the shelter. Several people shouted at it and threw rocks, but it took two rounds of that before it left.","Fontana Lodge

Ran across a guy with a tent in the woods, .5 mile past the pastures, who was burning leaves in a leaf pile. Not really smart. Kind of a spooky guy.During the night at Double Spring we had deer snorting and huffing at us several times. And the armadillos were very active. They sound so much bigger in the dark.

Fortunately, most was down hill. We also crossed into VA, our 4th state.Stealth camped about 1.5 miles outside of Damascus. The thunder was getting louder and turned into rolling thunder. Turns out a couple we knew were already camped there and Atlas was talking to them as I walked/ran in. I told Atlas more work, less talk, with the rain coming.We picked out trees and strung the tarps just in time. Finished setup under our tarps. Relaxed for about 15 minutes for the wave of rain to pass. Got water and opted to cook under our tarps. Usually, when I sit still for a while after a day of hiking I get stiff and am a bit slow to move. I was sitting on the ground eating my dinner when I glance up and see a bear moving toward me. We are camped on a small ridge with a gentle down slope. I put my food down, jumped up alerting the others to the bear, and am clapping my hands and hollering at it. I felt no pain getting up from a flat sit after seeing that bear, that close.Atlas jumps into action, getting the other campers to come out and help. He hollers at it and throws rocks. The bear moves off, but circles back. It is getting dark and I am looking for a tree to bear bag in down the slope. I am warned that Atlas just ran it off the trail and it maybe headed toward me. Sure enough, I turn my head and see it coming down from the trail toward me. Not in aggression, but confusion. I run back up the slope before I get cut off. It took 7 times to get it to finally leave. The last effort getting it to leave involved me watching Atlas running down the ridge after it throwing rocks and such. I never, ever, thought I would see my son chase a bear such a distance through the woods! The other couple opt to leave in the dark and rain and just go into town. They have had enough ""wildlife"".

She and her husband have a blueberry farm and allow hikers to stay on the land. We cowboy hammocked in some very old apple trees. It was a clear night and I could see the stars through the leaves and branches. We each got a homemade cookie. At this point, the littlest things make us happy. I bought boiled eggs that come from their chickens and that was our dinner for the night. In the morning I picked blue berries for my oatmeal. Naturally, a few (more than a few) went straight from hand to mouth.The level of mud entering Vermont is shocking. The trail was really overgrown as well. It hasn't rained in a few days yet water covers the trail in many parts. It's a mess. We are holding us well and are still happy to be on the trail. My knees haven't been quite the same since Bear Mtn in New York. They have put in rock steps up the entire south side and 3/4 of the north, with plans to complete the stairs next year. Manmade pathways are hard on our legs. Finally switched to trail runners after 1466 miles in the Chacos. Really like the Chacos better, but it will be getting colder at some point soon. Bought new pants for both of us at EMS. We have lost enough weight that the old ones were falling off of us and making life difficult. Plus, mine had ripped out on some seams and the front snaps also tore out. My underwear is showing thin spots while Atlas has developed holes. Love the wool for odor control and really pleased overall with them.
I made the command decision to take a bus up to Hanover, NH, and get back on the trail there. With the mud ankle deep or more now with no rain I can't imagine being on it during a rain. We hiked a large portion of the last couple of states in dark, raining conditions. That means slippery rocks and ankle deep water over the coarse of much of the trail. With water so prevalent on the Vermont section I am concerned the water will be shin/knee deep. And the use of boards or other methods to keep hikers above the mud are sparse. Maybe the trail improves in the more touristy sections. I get differing information from SOBO's so for safety and speed we are skipping the rest of Vermont.
We've hiked 1611 miles so far and will pick it back up at the 1747 mile marker. That leaves us with 442 miles to cover to reach the end.","Bennington, VT

We were pushing so hard the last few hundred miles, wifi was sparse, and I just didn't have the energy at the end of the day to write.  
In New Hampshire No Name left his poles in someone's vehicle while hitchhiking.  We were hitchhiking into the next town for supplies and he asked us to pick him up a set. This was also the last trail magic at a trail head we had as well.  An older couple was serving a wonderful assortment of grilled sandwiches, cookies, chips, soda, fresh fruit, etc...it was Heaven. We had no problem hitching into town, but getting out turned out to be problematic.  We were at it for over an hour and then tried to call around for a ride with no luck for another hour. It was starting to get dark when a pickup pulled over. He said had seen us in the grocery store and when he saw us by the road side got back as soon as he could.  Wow! That was real trail magic. We would have stealth camped, but we had to make it to the shelter were we 'hoped"" No Name was. Atlas had a moose crash around the trail in front of him. It was so dark he did't get a great look, but with the splashing across the stream and brush he was sure it was a moose. We got to the shelter after midnight. Next morning I saw No Name heading out so I shouted out to him to come get his poles (and pay me). It all worked out well.
We meet many university groups while in New Hampshire. It's a team building experience for the senior students to take out the junior ones. All pretty nice to be around.  Usually didn't stay in the shelters and got quite at dark except for one group.  Can't really complain about that. One time I was ahead of Atlas and  came out on a logging road and meet a pretty, sexy rabbit. Yes, in the middle of nowhere I came across a group of university students dressed in their rendition of Alice in wonderland and they were waiting for a group of friends to finish their hike and surprise them.  She asked if I had seen them and how far back they were. About that time Atlas came out and she took us over to meet the rest of the cast. Never a boring day.
The Whites were amazing. We were ""viewed out"", but the Whites gave it back to us.  It was so spectacular.  Ran across several thru hikers who had flipped earlier. Great to see them.  Bruiser had fallen in the Whites.  Black eyes, stitches, busted knees, scraped arms, etc...but still hiking. Lesson taken, don't fall. Rain made it unpleasant some days, plus the cold.  We were able to score several nights in the Huts. We did dishes, swept floors, and scrubbed pots. Some are more generous with their food than others.  First Hut we crossed in the morning we didn't spend the night, but they had a lot of extra scramble eggs and burnt bacon left over. Best cold eggs and burnt bacon ever. We were feed lasagna at another, an entire pan was left over. When they said we could have it all I teared up, being so happy yet so hungry. Some are better cooks than others, but who cares if it is free and you can sleep on a floor out of the cold and wet.  The ""paying customers"" found us fascinating. I was soaking my feet in a nearby stream and one wanted to take a picture of my feet. Okay??? We weren't able to hit all the Huts with our timeline and pace, but I strongly encourage any thru hiker to try for at least one in your journey.  They are a wonderful respite.
Maine was awesome. It's like the state is floating on rocks just above water. Most memorable was the last big hurdle the 100 mile wilderness.  We had been warned to wait if any rain was forecast, but just couldn't stall.  We took no zeros or neros since Vermont. We knew the only thing that would kill our journey at this point was injury and we were both able to push hard, being in total trail shape.  I did feel the beginings of plantar facitus in my left foot while in the Whites.  I was very careful with it to keep it from getting worse.
For the 100 mile Wilderness we planned to get through it in 5 days, carrying 6 days of food. It didn't quite go that way. First night stealth camping Atlas had his food bag raided by a mouse. We had the food bags hung in a tree properly, but the mice were pretty abundant and aggressive. We were cowboy hammocking  and I had one run across me in the night. Gross. I screamed a short bit it was such a surprise when it woke me.  The guy just upstream of us commented in the morning that he heard me, thought it might be a bear, but when he heard nothing else went back to sleep.  That's better than Atlas who didn't hear me at all and he was right there. Atlas lost a quarter of his food to the mouse.  He kept what he could, not planning to eat it, but you don't know for sure.
Then the rain came. The granite rocks of Maine are being eaten away by acid rain. It makes them just that much worse if you get scrapped by them. We opted to spend an extra day at a shelter to wait out the rain for safety.  For weeks we've  hungry all the time and I have lost more weight than I am comfortable with.  Probably the right decision. We caught up with the hikers who left in the rain and 2 had fallen on the rocks. One had contemplated calling for an air evac out. I looked at his leg and just agreed it looked bad, but I thought it just looked like a minor ding. My tumble down a rock slide in Maryland produced far more damage and the only thing I thought about was to keep moving.  
Two highlights for me came on the last day hiking the 100 Mile Wilderness. We had seen  a variety of ducks on the stunning lakes Maine is known for, but I hadn't heard or seen a Loon. I wanted to experience their call, it is so magical, but I had given up being the last day of trail hiking. Then, with the morning light starting to come over the lake I was hiking next to, I heard it! I stopped and actually looked over the water to see it swimming slowly away from the shore and calling out. It was wonderful. It made having to speed dance over the roots and rocks of Maine so worth it. I was so thrilled to have this experience. Later that same morning I heard a noise next to me that made me stop. I was so surprised to see a Pine Martin gazing back at me next to a tree just off the trail. He looked at me a bit and then climbed up the to sit on a low branch and observe me. We looked at each other for a bit and then I headed up the trail. He was so cute and I never thought to see one in the wild, much less calmly looking back at me. It was a good day.
In the end we were on food fumes by the time we got to Katadin.  I shared what I could with Atlas, but he did end up eating his mouse bitten reserves. Plus, he came across a half eaten protein bar that had fallen by the trail. Yes, he ate it, and if I had come across it first so would I. When we got to base of the mountain a park ranger was playing gatekeeper.  He had one spot open in the park camp for thru hikers.  We were blocked from entering. I joked we could share the space, but he didn't go for it. He gave us an alternate option for the morning of taking a shorter, but steeper route up to get to check in point. We went back down a bit, found super overpriced food, and stealth camped in the gravel quarry. We were up at dark 30, up the mountain 10 miles, checked in at the ranger station to get our permit and set off to finish. We had great weather. Really cold in the morning, but okay once the sun was up. I made it  past most of the boulders, and such when I felt the tendons giving out in my left foot. I knew I was done. I told Atlas to keeping going and I made my way down to the ranger station to wait for him. The goal was to thru hike without permanent damage. Did I get to the tip top of Katadin, no; did I accomplish my goal, yes. 
I waited in the shade watching people come and go. When Atlas arrived we hugged and cried so hard. It was such a momentous moment. I am tearing up now writing about it. 
We had planned to hitchhike out, but there was room on a shuttle so we took that to the local motel. Wonderful, older place with big rooms, and w/in walking distance to a nice grocery store. But, it gets better. The plan was to take the local taxi to the next town to catch the bus to Bangor to take a flight home. Not to bad logistically until I called the taxi company. They had message on their machine saying that yesterday their license was suspended for what ever reason and until resolved couldn't do business. Hmmm. I couldn't schedule the bus or the plane until I knew how we were going to  get to the bus. I went to the motel lobby and explained our situation to the gal on the front desk. She thought I had surely got my information wrong as they used that taxi service for their customers all the time. I invited her to call them.  She did and that was the 1st time that had ever happened. Dandy. Still doesn't get us to the airport. She was kind enough to call around to find us a ride to the bus from the other lodges. Yeah! I was walking away when a maid came over and talked to me about our situation. She said her husband worked in Bangor and drove in everyday and that if we didn't mind getting up super early he could get us there. YES! They were so kind to make that offer, which was accepted. The next day we were taken in comfort to Bangor. He picked us up at 5:30 am, but that fit with us. I tried to give him something for his generosity, but he refused, just saying to pay it forward. 
We were dropped at a convenience store and called a cab for the short hop to the airport. He gave me a funny look when I got in the cab and told him which terminal at the airport. I didn't think too much about it until we arrived and realized why. The airport is all of one small building terminal, so no problem getting to a terminal.  In DFW there are 5 huge terminals, all separated, so you better know exactly were you are supposed to be catch a flight. Coming home was nice and a let down. 
No one will ever really understand how hard it was, how magical, how awful the gnats/mosquitoes, painful falls, the kindness of strangers, the weirdness of some hikers, the annoying people who are telling you you won't make it, the special hikers you meet like AT AT Walker, Walk More, Ninja,Swiss Miss, Alpiner, No Name, Nice Nat Nasty Nat, Stumble Weed, Wrong Way, Cowboy, Red, 10%, Grits, Florida, Key West, and many others, unless they have experienced it. 
The trail changed me a great deal. I closed my business, took a part-time job, started school and am taking prereq classes for nursing. Short term goal, finish prereqs; intermediate goal, finish nursing school; long term goal, hike the CDT, then go to work as a nurse.  Surprise! I am planning to thru hike the CDT.","stealth camped in quarry
