I am an experienced hiker with some winter-travel mileage; nevertheless, I plan to come off the trail when weather prevents safe or reasonable progress. The secret to this non-schedule is to be retired! But we'll see what I signed up for...I hope my journal is engaging and interesting to read. Keeping a journal for others to read is not something that I've done before. Let me know if I am boring you to tears or not providing information that you want to read about.

I am retired now, so I may as well use this advantage to slow the pace of my hike and provide some breaks along the way and perhaps avoid (another) over-use injury too.I fly into Atlanta on 1/7. If the Forest Service road to the top of Springer is open, I will start from Springer on 1/8. If it is closed I will use the approach trail on 1/8.I am looking forward to seeing who else will be on the trail enjoying the winter wonderland in the southern Appalachians!",,View Entry,"Dec 12, Sat",0

The elevations here don't have the sustained elevations of the mountains in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park or the White Mountains, but their elevations are similar to other sections of the AT. Unfortunately for my rehearsals, we've had an unusually mild and dry November and December here. Our mild weather got me to wondering if this weather-charm might follow me to the southern Appalachians this January and February, which would be a nice surprise.Anyway, I am getting final details in place for my big adventure, which is less than a month away now.

SlipKnot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519212,"I am relieved that the planning, equipping, and rehearsing phases of my thru hike adventure are over! It actually became easier when I realized that it wasn't possible or necessary to make every decision for the entire hike before leaving.
I decided that I wanted a mantra for my hike and I decided it will be, ""Stay Healthy."" At the end of each day the first question I should ask myself is how well did I care for myself today and then I can ask how far did I travel today. If I stay healthy, I will stay on the trail, and if I stay on the trail sufficient trail-progress will come my way without chasing miles, or worse yet, chasing other hikers, both of which are past habits that I'd like to change. An important part of my staying healthy will be to stay in contact with family and friends at home and to make many new friends on the trail. For all the horrors of cell phones, they are still the best invention for staying close to people, except when driving (take note my daughters.)

SlipKnot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519405,"I started hiking north from Springer Mountain, Georgia at 10:20 this morning. Within the first hour I met my first trail friend/angel, Sunflower. She was in the last hour of her SOBO thru hike and I was in the first hour of my NOBO thru hike, which I thought was cool. We hiker-chatted briefly and then she gave me her water bottle strap. I haven't heard of an AT custom of keeping mementoes in perpetual motion up and down the trail, so evidently the inaccessibility of my water bottle was concerning. Anyway, it was sweet of her. I will consider the strap a good luck charm until I fall or a bear takes my food, which ever comes first. 
I was in my weather suit most of the day, but it was a good hiking day as the trail was still firm. I am socked-in with mist and fog so I didn't see these beautiful north Georgia mountains in their glory today.

Tonight I am tented at Woody Gap, GA which is five miles north of Gooch Mountain Shelter, GA. Tomorrow night I plan to be at Neel's Gap, GA. I just heard by email from Subman that the hostel at Neel's Gap is closed for renovation. I had planned to stay there and recharge my phone! Perhaps I can tent there and make arrangements to recharge my phone overnight at the store there; otherwise, the next opportunity to recharge is Hiawassee, GA at mile 70. On Monday morning I will meet Subman at Neel's Gap and we'll hike together for a few days. It will be nice to have company with local knowledge of these mountains.
I met one hiker today, a SOBO thru hiker (trail name Carpenter) from New Hampshire who flip flopped from Massachusetts to Maine and then Massachusetts to Georgia. But it's the weekend and there may be more people out there to meet tomorrow, although the weather isn't great.
This evening I performed the second most dreaded trail-skill: putting a fly-tent up in the rain (most dreaded is putting a fly-tent up in the rain and in darkness.). Hopefully in the morning I won't need to perform the third most dreaded trail-skill: taking a fly-tent down in the rain. But these are skills that I will need regardless of where I am in the trail.
The first few hours today I thought I was hiking in fog, but then I realized that I was actually hiking in clouds! It gave the trail a very cozy closed in feeling, although I would have liked to enjoy the vistas I passed.
There is the pitter-patter of rain on my tent tonight, but I am safe, dry, and warm...","Hawk Mountain Shelter, GA

SlipKnot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519476,"Today I met many Georgians for two reasons: it was Sunday and I hiked over Blood Mountain, which I could tell must be a popular day-hike destination given the number of people I saw hiking to the summit (that was fogged in.) Even so, it was nice to have company on such a weather-day!
When I got to my destination at Neel's Gap, I met a NOBO thru hiker named ""Berserker"" (I didn't ask!) Tonight we are sharing a cabin at Blood Mountain Cabins, which are only a quarter mile from the AT. As it coincidentally turned out, we are both veterans of the Afghanistan War so we had war stories to tell that always started: ""This is no sh*t, there I was..."" 
Tomorrow I am hiking with Subman, who lives locally and completed an AT thru hike a few years ago and is starting another one in March with his close friend Suds.In a few days, my first town-stop will be in Hiawassee, GA. It's such a fun word to say: Hiawassee. I like to put the inflection on the ""wassee"" part.

SlipKnot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519517,"Today the air was cold and crispy-dry and the sky was deep blue, which made me feel like I was hiking in a post card. It was a day of excellent long views of these beautiful north Georgia mountains. If you are curious about the weather I am hiking in, go to atweather.org and enter the state I am in and the shelter I am at or near. My cabin mate from last night, NOBO thru hiker trail name Berserka, and I went our separate ways first thing this morning. He did a zero morning at the cabin and was planning a lower mileage day today. I met Subman at Neel's Gap as planned and we started hiking north at 9 a.m. Along the way Sub pointed out in a distance Brass Town Bald, which is the highest point in Georgia. Sub and I also saw a large buck from less than 100 feet away who was not in the least concerned about us. We met three SOBO thru hikers: Butter and McGee and Frisbee. Astonishingly, McGee was hiking in a tee-shirt and without a hat or gloves. We also met Winkle, who is a local trail maintainer and angel but out hiking today. When we arrived at our destination at Low Gap Shelter, we met AK who is a young NOBO thru hiker who is also keeping a journal. Sub will stay out for two more nights, as this is only a tune-up for his upcoming thru hike starting this March.

SlipKnot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519558,"Tonight I am tenting two miles south of Tray Mountain Shelter. It's roaring windy here but the temperatures have moderated some. I am safe, dry, and warm snuggled in my tent for a long winter's nap. The coldest part of the day is the morning transition from sleeping bag to hiking, which I call camp fuss time. But nothing drives stream-lining fuss time like cold mornings.
Important question: If a friend of mine has a quest to complete an AT thru hike without falling, but fell on a 0.2 mile blue-blazed side trail to a water source, would that fall count as falling on an AT thru hike even though he was not technically on the white-blazed AT trail? My friend is anxious to know. Maybe whiteblaze.org has had this as an important forum question in the past? ??
Today's hike was another picture perfect winter's hike in the north Georgia mountains. I shed and or added layers all day depending if I was on the sunny or shaded or lee or windward side of mountains. This is the first day that I didn't meet any SOBOs; however, I met Winkle on the trail again, which was a pleasant surprise. I think the word is ubiquitous?
Since Subman is on a conditioning hike for his March thru hike, hiking in any direction will do, so first thing this morning he headed south back to his truck parked at Neel's Gap. Tomorrow he will drive north to Dick's Creek Gap (US 76) and start hiking south to meet me. After we meet, he will hike back north to Dick's Creek Gap with me. But the best part: after we reach Dick's Creek Gap, he will then turn into a trail angel and drive me to Hiawassee where I will pillage restaurants and stay the night. Today, AK and I hiked north but he headed into Hiawassee after we reached Unicoi Gap ( GA Highway 75.). Last night I had Subman and AK as camping buddies, but tonight I am alone.
The number one reason to bring a stove on a winter's hike: boiling water in the morning to thaw tent pegs frozen into the ground (part of morning fuss time.)

Today was another clear blue sky day of hiking. This was the second day of my not seeing any SOBO thru hikers, so I wonder if the season is over for them? I met one NOBO thru hiker just north of Tray Mountain. His trail name is Otis and he started north on January 1st. Subman and I went to dinner in Hiawassee and then I thanked him for coming out for a couple of days to hike with me and for the ride to Hiawassee, and then we parted ways. I may link up with AK tomorrow. We are 30 years different in age, so we may not be well-paired hikers.","Two miles south of Tray Mtn Shelter

SlipKnot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519716,"Last night I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Hiawassee, GA and then got a shuttle back to the trail, arriving back at the Dick's Creek Gap trail head at 11:00 a.m. It was a beautiful, warm, short mileage day to Plumorchard Gap Shelter where I linked-up with AK, as we had planned. AK started a campfire, which isn't something I was expecting to see on the trail until late Spring. We will hike together tomorrow, which really means linking-up again tomorrow night. Tomorrow morning I will likely leave early then he will leave, but arrive later due to our different pacing. Tomorrow starts another weekend so hopefully I will see many day and weekend hikers as I did last weekend.
By the way, my post from two days ago about blue vs. white blaze falling was hopefully understood to be tongue-in-cheek. But, I haven't fallen yet! I should stop talking about it as it can only jinx me.
I have unusual but long practiced pacing in that I hike for exactly sixty minutes and then I rest for exactly ten minutes, regardless of where I might be on the trail. For each sixty minutes that I hike I put an overhand knot into a short shoelace attached to my pack belt. Each knot is about two miles. Hikers often ask me if I am okay when they see me sprawled out in my unlikely rest spots. Anyway, for me this pacing technique provides a comforting trail-rhythm to my day that is independent of location, terrain, weather, or trail conditions.","Dick's Creek Gap ( US 76)

Last week my weather suit held up nicely in intermittent rain, but today not so well. Franklin, NC is two days away and I will go into town and dry out and make improvements to my weather techniques.
I am in North Carolina now! This is my first night sleeping in a shelter. It was raining way too hard to get my tent up. I am alone tonight. I passed AK six miles south of here in a shelter trying to warm up and I am guessing he pulled up there for the day.
I saw two SOBOs today but it wasn't good weather for chatting. After they've hiked so far I can appreciate their focus on finishing. I hope one day to move as effortlessly as they seem to move. One of the SOBOs was a woman from Colorado who was hiking without trekking poles, which I can't even imagine. She told me there were about ten NOBO's ahead of me, which is nice to know. The journal in this shelter was signed by a NOBO yesterday.

I stopped early in the day and set a line to dry clothing after yesterday's rain. AK started his day five miles behind me and zoomed by me on his way to trying to hike a 25+ mile day! I would be off the trail in less than a week if I tried to pace that. I only saw one pair of weekend hikers today. I can't believe that I have been on the trail for a week already.

After I posted my journal last night, Butter arrived at the shelter. I have met Butter twice, once in Georgia when he was SOBO and last night in North Carolina when he was NOBO. This unusual occurrence happened because Butter bypassed the last 100 miles of North Carolina on his SOBO trip and then flip flopped to NOBO to finish the miles. Butter started a fire and I finished drying my socks by the fire with my feet still in the socks. It was fun to see the steam coming off the socks and feel my feet warm up. I met one young SOBO named JT today. He started on June 11th but had to leave the trail for six weeks to recover from an over use injury. In a moment of self reflection, he said that if he just hiked 12 miles a day he'd be finished by now. I loved hearing that! He was very encouraging by telling me that once I shed my winter-travel pack the trail would become even more fun. Tomorrow is a short day and then I am getting a shuttle to Franklin, NC to resupply.

SlipKnot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519896,"Today was another beautiful day of hiking, just like the last few days. I got into a Franklin, NC motel yesterday afternoon and was shuttled back onto the trail in the early afternoon today. I then hiked to the first shelter. Ideally for me, shelters, towns, and hostels are always 12 to 14 miles apart, but of course that is not always the case. This shelter was a little too close to my start point today, but the next shelter too far, especially given my later start time today. It's part of the trail-calculus thru hikers are always doing. I think I am due for a weather change starting tomorrow mid-day. My tactic during weather is to expose as little clothing as possible to it. Below the waist I wear a jammer-style bathing suit under my rain pants (I am a lap swimmer.) Above the waist I try to wear just one wool layer under my rain jacket. Wet wool retains more of its insulating qualities than wet synthetics do, but the trade-off is wool's greater weight. And then plan to be wet if the snow or rain is relentless. Once you are wet, the only way to stay warm is to stay moving or pull up in a closer shelter and change clothing. I have been astounded by the reliability of Verizon cell service during the first 114 miles of the AT in the southern Appalachians, but in case I don't have service tomorrow night, my plan is to reach Cold Spring Shelter, NC tomorrow.

But I am satisfied because I fell to a worthy adversary - a long narrow exposed tree root that crossed the trail at a downward angle AND was snow covered. It was such a clean and fast take down that all I could do is say, ""well done"" to the tree.
Today was a gentle reminder that I am hiking into winter, but it wasn't until 2 p.m. that I put on my gaiters and snow travelers. I was at my destination at 2:30 p.m. The snow was light enough that my weather suit kept my under layer dry, which I was so happy to see. I met two SOBOs today. One of them was heading from Springer Mountain directly to California to start the PCT after he finished the AT. It was a reminder that there is life after the AT and it's good to have a plan for it, no matter how far off finishing the AT seems to me at this point. I may have promised my wife that after the AT I would settle down and buy golf clubs and learn to play, as she does. Tomorrow I am hiking mostly down hill to the Nantahala Outdoor Center and staying at the hostel there, which I made a reservation for. I called ahead and found out the restaurant there is closed in Jan/Feb this year and the outfitter shop is only open from 11 to 4.

She and four other NOBOs are at the Fontana Lodge, which is at the very southern end of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. They are holding up at the lodge pending their weather-based decision to enter the park, which is at very high elevation and has only one exit halfway through its sixty mile length. I am about two days south of the Fontana Lodge. Tomorrow I am hiking to Stecoah Gap, which involves going just over 5,000 feet to get there, so it will give me a good example of how much snow is at elevation and how difficult it is to move through it.

Above 3,000 feet the trail is very slow-go and in some places it can be difficult to see the trace of the trail because of the snow depth and drifting. I lost the trail twice today and had to scout to get back on it. Scouting for the trail always makes for anxious moments regardless of how many times you may have done it before. This morning I gave myself a hard stop: if I wasn't at my halfway point at 12:30 pm, I would pull up at Sassafras Shelter and stay the night. I didn't get to my halfway point until 12:45, so here I am at Sassafras Shelter. I may have been able to complete the second half of my hike, but it would have been edgy and perhaps dark before I finished, both of which are inconsistent with how I hike. But the really good news is that even though I pushed snow for hours, my socks are dry! The rhododendron tunnels are formidable obstacles when loaded with snow. I was in my weather suit all day because of them. They are like nature's car wash. Tomorrow morning I go over 5,000 feet first thing for just a little while and then hike mostly downhill another 6.7 miles to Stecoah Gap.

I could almost walk on the snow on sunny south and west slopes. The snow on north and east slopes is still very loose and deeper. However, by far the greatest determiner of snow depth is elevation. The difference in snow depth between 5,000 feet and 3,500 feet was striking. At 2,100 feet in Robbinsville, there is no snow at all. As the snow started to compact today, the eroded contour of the trail became more visible and the trail more easily followed than yesterday.
I needed to eat! The diet of gas station food while storm-zeroing two days at the Nantahala Outdoor Center took its toll on me. I was at my shuttle pick up location by 12:30 today and was in Robbinsville, NC within minutes. This is an excellent trail town because of its compactness.

I am presently at Fontana Dam, which is the southern end of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park, and tomorrow I will car shuttle 70 miles to the north end and resume my NOBO hike from there. Later in my hike I will return by bus and shuttle to the north end of the Smokies and do a SOBO hike through them and then return to my northern most point of progress and continue NOBO. My mini flip flop will provide the opportunity for me to hike at lower winter elevations, as compared to the Smokies. I think adding the mini flip flop to my itinerary will be fun. After hiking through more winter weather to come, I will feel like a college kid on Spring break headed south by bus to warmer weather and a week of hiking in the Smokies.

Phase three is a canoe trip from the Missouri head waters to St. Louis.

Vermont's pride in its beloved Long Trail is such that only at the bottom of the sign is the AT parenthetically mentioned as following the Long Trail.

I will do laundry, resupply, and eat restaurant food before returning to the trail in the morning. I feel fortunate that the small grocery store in town had a good hiker-resupply selection. There aren't many resupply points on the AT now, so when a resupply point comes up, it's best to use it, rather than run out of food on the trail in the middle of nowhere.

As I was descending this afternoon, a thunderstorm accompanied by heavy rain arrived, so I pulled-up at the lower elevation Safford Notch Campsite to get out of the storm. I set my tent on a tenting platform and snuggled-in to wait out the storm, but then I decided to stay the night here since the trail became slimy wet, the rocks slippery, and the afternoon got late as I waited for the storm to move on, which hasn't yet. Although the hiking day was abbreviated, I feel blessed to have been off the high peaks when the storm was at its worse.

This morning I lost a lot of elevation all the way down to 1200 feet. At lower elevation the trail profile became flatter, the trail surface smoother, and the forest returned to hardwoods, whose more dispersed canopies allowed sunlight to sparkle on the trail and illuminate it. This afternoon I hiked along the edge of some impressively large lakes, which Maine calls ponds. I am tenting between shelters again tonight, this time at an unofficial site. Tomorrow I am going into Caratunk, ME to resupply and eat and maybe sleepover, as I did in Stratton, ME. I am safe, dry, and warm tonight.","5.3 miles north of Horn's Pond Shelter, ME

To discourage hikers from attempting a dangerous ford of the river, the Appalachian Mountain Club provides a free ferry service across the river by canoe. Once ferried across the river, I went into Caratunk, ME, which except for the power lines and autos, could be life a century ago, but it had a free community phone outside the town office which I used for calling a shuttle to the hostel I am staying at here in Caratunk. On the front porch of the Caratunk post office was a hiker-box and I scored a trail angel freshly made PB&J sandwich while waiting for my shuttle to the hostel. Maine is by far the most wilderness and country-rural of states on the AT. I will eat and resupply here and return to the AT in the morning. My plan is to finish the AT and return home well fed and rested, rather than looking and feeling like an exhausted trail-survivor pushed to his limit.

I can see one fish as a probability, but two seems improbably lucky, but it was catch and release day on the AT. I have a short six mile hike tomorrow morning and then I am going into Monson, ME, which is the last town stop on the AT where food can be purchased. Monson is at the south end of the 100 Mile Wilderness, which is the final leg of the AT before Katahdin. I will do all the usual hiker tasks in Monson before starting north again. Tonight I am tenting between shelters near a water source, which is my favorite place to spend a night. Sometimes I enjoy the social aspects of a well-utilized shelter and sometimes I like a quiet evening in the vast forest.

SlipKnot,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543415,"Last night's thunderstorm just missed me, but I was ready and waiting for it anyway. It's essential that every tent peg on light-weight backpacking tents stays in the ground during high winds. If just one peg comes out of the ground during high winds the tent loses it structural strength very quickly, which I learned in the Shenandoah National Park in the Spring where I unfortunately saw some wind-demolished tents. This morning I short-hiked during a beautiful dawn and early morning to the intersection of the AT and ME Highway 15 and was then shuttled into a hostel in Monson, ME. I arrived early enough that the hostel guests were still having breakfast, so I joined them. I had a nice lunch and dinner downtown today too.

My hope is that my youngest daughter, who lives in Maine, will summit Katahdin with me and she is busy trying to adjust her work schedule to accommodate me.

I did my first day in the 100 Mile Wilderness today. There weren't any fire-swamps or rodents of unusual sizes in The Wilderness, so I think I will be okay. I didn't meet any NOBOs today, but I passed by at least ten SOBOs headed towards Monson. The SOBOs I meet tomorrow will be very new, having hiked less than 100 miles of the AT.

The view south from the summit was of seemingly endless mountains; however, the view north was of a stunningly flat landscape, like no other place on the AT. The trail likewise flattens out starting tomorrow, but I've heard that although big climbing is over with, the trail surface is still rocks, roots, and ruts. Perhaps I can high-step over some of the rocks, roots, and ruts with my high hips and long legs. I was looking forward to soaking in the East Branch of the Pleasant River after hiking today, but the river was very slow moving and brackish and a long, rascally, and hungry leech attached itself to my foot within minutes. I am tenting next to another empty shelter tonight. The SOBO bubble must be south of me now and the NOBOs more spread out on the trail.

Then I dodged a mid-morning thunder and rain storm by ducking into a shelter that was close by. In the afternoon, I set my poles and rain fly up in order to stay dry during another storm. Taking time to keep my shoes dry during these short duration storms is worth the delay it takes to keep them dry. It's evening now and yet another storm is coming, as the thunder is getting loader, but I could give a care if it storms and rains at night. Consistent with my new AT mantra (I'll never be hungry again), I rendezvoused with my food drop late this afternoon at a private road crossing, which is a food service hostels will provide for a fee.

The many lakes and streams along the northern sections of trail in Maine may make Maine my favorite AT state, even though passing through Maine's Mahoosuc Notch one mile long boulder pit in the southern trail section was like being in an episode of the TV show American Ninja Warrior, which doesn't have much to do with hiking either.

It is for the same reason my left-side and I scouted Springer Mountain, Georgia in January 2015.

My two older daughters were in my corner every step of the way too. Behind every thru-hiker is a support staff of trail angels, hiking club trail maintainers, US Forest Service workers, National Park Service workers, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, the Appalachian Mountain Club, many state park service workers, providers of rides to town, and hostel workers who work long days to please their hiker guests.
