Abbey and Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519404,"Eric and I (Abbey) have been planning this trip for a year and eight months and it is surreal to be finally writing our first trail journal after reading countless journals from past thru hikers. We have read books and journals and gear reviews to help us prepare for our journey but I must admit I still think we are unprepared. When it comes to gear we learned not all gear works for everyone and you will get a different opinion from everywhere you look. You really just have to try it out and see what works for you. We have returned shoes, packs, and every other kind of hiking gear you can imagine. It seemed like every time we did a shakedown hike we realized something wasn't going to work. Luckily REI is wonderful and let's you return anything without a hassle. We are planning mail drops for the majority of our reapply but we still intend to purchase food along the way in towns. We have been dehydrating so much food that we are hearing the dehydrator running in our sleep. We made it a point to make sure our diet would have plenty of protein so hopefully we don't waste away on the hike. All of our lunches and dinners have a meat source and veggies in them so we are not just eating the typical thru hiker fare like Lipton sides and GORP. I'm not sure how much our packs are weighing in at yet but I'm sure the gear police will tell us they are way too heavy! It's our stuff though and we will get rid of things when we realize we don't want to carry them anymore. At this time we ""need"" the extras we think, but we will send things home as come to realize we really don't need them. We plan on posting our gear list as this was always the topic we were most interested in when we were reading trail journals. I think that is all for now but we will continue to post as we get ready for our start date.",,70 Days Away!!,"Jan 08, Fri",0
Abbey and Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519533,"As we sit here and watch the snow fall here in Ohio we are spending the day unloading and reloading the dehydrator and organizing our packs and gear and all this food that keeps accumulating from our many Costco trips. Our start date, March 19th, is quickly approaching and it seems like we have an endless to do list. Organize, reorganize, what do we still need? We are always assessing the situation. Today we realize we are getting very close to being ready.",,66 Days,"Jan 12, Tue",0

Abbey and Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519561,"For our trip we are using ""AWOL"" A.T. guidebook! We preordered it forever ago. I just got the email that it's in the mail. We will have it in 1-3 days!!! Yay!!",,Guide book,"Jan 12, Tue",0
Abbey and Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521357,We officially leave in one month. My (Abbey) wonderful parents have volunteered to drive us to the trail. We will do the approach trail and then they will pick us up and stay one more night with us. The next day they will drop us off at Springer for the long haul. In a couple of days we are going to go put all of our meals and drop boxes together. This is our final step in preparation. My parents are also going to be in charge of sending our mail drops. We are so lucky to have their help. Hopefully they won't get tired of us because I'm sure we are gonna ask for a million more favors along the way. Luckily I have a big family and Eric's parents are always willing to help us out too. We have a good support team. Everyone is really excited for us. We are not getting the negativity some people are experiencing from family and friends. We love them all so much and are very thankful to have them!,,One month away,"Feb 18, Thu",0
Abbey and Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523907,"We are on our way!! We have been so busy visiting friends and family these last couple weeks the time really flew by. Our social calendar has never been so busy. Now it's time though to put all our planning into action. We can not be more excited and nervous at the same time. The drive from home to Amicacola Falls is approximately 8.5 hours and the anticipation may just kill us. We need to do some cutting of gear in our packs as we are still a couple of pounds over where we want to be so sacrifices must be made. The first day on the trail looks like rain so the saying no pain, no rain, no Maine will be true right off the bat. Well that is all for now and next time we post we will be doing so on the trail!","One month away

Abbey and Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524077,Today Abbey's parents dropped us off at the approach trail at Amicalola Falls. We did 10 long hard miles to the Springer mountain parking lot where they picked us back up so we could spend one more night in a hotel and have a shower and a bed. It was a good day out there and the view of the falls almost made the extra 8.8 miles worth it.   Abbey is starting to get a blister on her foot so we will tend that and I am looking into getting a second knee brace for My other knee due to my runners knee.. We made really good time and felt pretty strong out there. We are a little sore but will probably be ok by morning. We had to call my brother and have him ship us a few things we forgot from home. Thanks Josh! We are sad to see Abbey's family head home but are excited to continue our hike. See you out there and until next time!,"

Abbey and Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524356,"Saying goodbye to mom and dad was sad. I will definitely miss them. We were really excited to get started on the trail though. The terrain was not too bad yesterday compared to the falls and we did 7 miles rather quickly. We got to Hawk mountain shelter at like 2 o'clock and got our camp set up. We got to meet many other thru hikers which was really cool and of course there were a couple of guys from Ohio (we are everywhere). We filtered water for the first time which was a pain having to collect it from a shallow stream but it tasted really good. We also used bear lines for the first time which is very convenient compared to trying to hang your own. We wanted to sit around the fire and chat but the dropping temp and high winds chased us into the tent at like 6 pm. The forecast is calling for lows of 28-29 degrees, 1/2-1 inch of snow, and 20-25 mph winds so it looks like a rough night.","

Abbey and Eric ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524362,The morning was bitter cold keeping us in our tent until well after the sun came up and it was very difficult to get out of the sleeping bag. The night was pretty tough due to the cold and crazy wind. We stepped out of the tent to snow on the ground which always surprises us northerners to see snow in Georgia. Due to the late start we did not leave the shelter until after 9 am. Once we got moving we warmed up quickly. The hike today was pretty tough as we went over sassafras and Justus mountains which was a pretty steep elevation climb but we did get some pretty nice views. We had lunch on a rock outcropping on Justus mountain which was pretty awesome. We were ready to see gooch mountain shelter when we arrived at 4 pm. The campsites were almost completely full so it was lucky we arrived when we did as a few people had to keep hiking to the next shelter. Most of the hikers from the previous shelter were here also which was nice so we could continue to get to know them better. Tonight is not supposed to be as cold which is great but still going to be in the low 30s. Going to bed at like 830 which is also known as hiker midnight as tomorrow will be our longest mileage day yet.,"
