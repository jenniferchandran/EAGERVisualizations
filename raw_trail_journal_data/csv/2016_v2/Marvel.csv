Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524964,"My mom and I finally hit the AT over spring break! The family drove down to Damascus with four days of food hoping that ""the guy"" would give us a suggestion for which section of the AT we should hike. ""The guy"" gets a A+ for sending us north to hike through the Grayson Highlands into Damascus. We started at Fox Creek (a little under 42 miles) with a family of 5 with kids 10, 8, and 7. Their packs matched their trekking poles! The family stayed at the same hostel (Woodchuck`s) as us and had exactly the same schedule -how`s that for coincidences! Those kids kicked it singing Christmas carols down the trail. The views were incredible with open ridges and a healthy invigorating wind to keep things interesting.                                                                                First night was at Thomas Knob, an fantastic shelter with two floors and a drop-dead-gorgeous view. Last Chance and Seeker warned us about the wind but we didn`t have any problems. We stayed up there with a couple of overnighters and met Big Country as he trucked in around 7. His trail name is 100% fitting - he was one of the most genuine people I have ever met. From Thomas Knob we trucked a dozen miles to Lost Mountain Shelter taking our time to soak in the views (especially from Buzzard`s Rock). By the time we made it in, the shelter was full but we wanted to try out our Big Agnes in the rain anyway. Good News! Despite raining all night the tent stayed dry- well sort of. Right before the rain started we thought in would be a great idea to try to steripen our camelback bladders. I accidentally dropped mine and my mom`s was not screwed on right so in the matter of 5 seconds our tent went from the Sahara to the Pacific. After the initial ""OH CRAP"" we speed hung our sleeping bags and tag-teamed drying the tent with bandanas. Thankfully nothing stayed wet and the water didn`t have time to dampen the bags - huge shoutout to modern backpacking gear! The rest of the night went smoothly for my mom. I decide to become a pescetarian (vegetarian plus fish) in seventh grade and haven`t eaten meat since -minus that 3 month period when I was a taco-tarian who only at the tacos at our favorite Mexican restaurant. But that night she opened a beef stick the amazing smell wavered my resolve. Obviously, it was time for me to find some protein so I decided to go for a tuna packet. I`ve never been a tuna fan, but I am a fan of trying new things. But this thing was like eating cat food. If my mom had gone for the mountain house skillet with eggs peppers onions and sausage I don`t know if I would have walked away a vegetarian. The next day, we both felt great so we decided to shorten our trip and just go for the 16 miles into Damascus. Along the way we meet both AT&T cell phone coverage (a miracle) and some incredible people. One absolutely stunning woman was on her first day of the trail. She had been in a wheelchair for 14 years and just started hiking with her dog four years ago! Now she`s happily joining the AT while her 5 sons and 12 grandkids sit a home worrying about her. (Sit a home part not actually accurate). I couldn`t write this post and leave out the most beautiful moment of the trip. A few miles out from Lost Mountain Shelter nature called so I dug my first cathole. For the next 3 miles I weightlessly floated along the trial.                   Heading back to Woodchuck`s Hostel, I gleefully annihilated a veggie burger, two catfish tacos, and an entire plate of chips & salsa. That night at the hostel was easily the most fun. Meeting Rocky, Medic, Big Critter, Fresh Ground, and everyone else was so rewarding - but mostly just funny. This morning Fresh Ground asked me ""You wish you were heading out on the trail with us today don`t you."" I emphatically agreed and decided that exactly two months from today, I will start my flip-flop through hike in Harper`s Ferry. These past few days have been a few of my happiest and I can`t wait to hike some more big rocks!",,Damascus ,"Mar 26, Sat",14
Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531116,"I took out my last day as a legal minor with a bang! At around mile 39 of 40 it was more of a slow painful waddle than a bang. My mom and I joined the Cleveland Hiking Club in January and our first hike was a 13 mile off trail adventure up and down ravines with one of the fastest leaders in the club. My poor mom is still suffering from PTSD from that one. But we came back the very next day for another off trail 10 miler with the club and we're still coming back. On hike #2 we got a pamphlet of all the hikes the club offered and on the first day of May we saw a really big number: 40. My first comment was, how long does it take them? Two days? Three? We mutually agreed that 40 miles in one day was crazy and who would ever want to do that? So I guess we're crazy. We woke up at 2am to make the drive up to Chagrin Falls area to start to hike a 4am. The first two hours were fantastic. We hiked abandoned (at 4 am) roads through zombie weather. (N-+ote: Zombie weather is heavy fog where streetlights eerily silhouette groups of black figures) As the sun slowly lightened the night, I tripped in a puddle. Around 9:30 we made it to the ""halfway point"" where the club fed us watermelon, this fantastic tomato spinach soup, hard-boiled eggs, and just about everything I had been dreaming about for the last 18 miles. Then we started on the 22 mile loop. Then we discovered music and TED Talks. It is astonishingly easier to ignore tired feet if you have ""how to live on Mars"" and ""Mumford and Sons"" in your fanny pack. I think the happiest moment of the hike was at mile 26 when the club set of an A+ food station. I have never been happier to see watermelon in my life! For about half a second I imagined carrying a watermelon on the AT. That image was far funnier than it should have been. We made it another 8 miles. But we did take up all the seats in the Drug Mart pharmacy line to take care of feet. After that much abuse, the feet swelled up so I changed socks, loosed the shoe, took some Advil, and applied some duct tape. Then we stopped in a tavern for a beer to take care of other stuff. At the final rest stop there were some incredible people with equally incredible chairs. For being a first time 40 miler, a happy older man pulled out two giant red roses from his car and tied them to our jackets. We truly appreciated it. I only accidentally elbowed that poor rose 200 times in the following 6 miles. We made it the last 100 feet with the huge help of the help cheering committee. And the thought of more watermelon. The entire hike far exceed our expectations. Honestly, getting out of the car afterwards was much more difficult than hiking 40 miles. Both of us and incredibly excited to get out on the AT at the end of May and appreciate the Cleveland Hiking Club for helping us toughen up our feet.",,View Entry,"May 21, Sat",40
Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534738,"ALMOST THERE! I graduated yesterday and my grandparents are driving us to the Delaware Water Gap to start our hike tomorrow! I’ve been so busy planning for the AT that it hasn’t sunk it that we are leaving NOW. I've really only had time to focus on packing this past week. Between my family coming in, my graduation, all of my extracurriculars coming to an end, and saying goodbye to some incredible people by going of kayak trips and having parties I managed to set up mail drops and pull gear together.         I’m moderately happy with the gear; I pushed my mom and myself to pack as light and with food for 3 nights 4 days our packs weigh about 26 and 28 pounds without water. Hopefully, we’ll learn how to bring weight down more on the trail.         However, I’m not happy with my muscles. Confession time: since the 40 mile hike on May 1st, I have exercised a total of zero times! About two weeks ago, I walked Echo (my best 4 legged friend with breath that could knock a grown man unconscious). I was planning on a quick trip out to the field behind my house so I threw on a pair of oversized rubber work boots without socks.On the walk, Echo saw a herd of deer and took off into the wood, me running behind him. Luckily, Echo is a terrible tracking dog and lost them after two seconds, but we wandered through the woods until we came to an empty field. Walking through it, we disturbed a pair of what I initially thought were giant ultra-fluffy red tailed hawks. They flew off into the woods but the pair managed to piss off every nesting bird in the tri-state area so it wasn’t hard to track them. It turns out they were these drop-dead-gorgeous barred owls. The first I’ve seen in those woods! We watched each other for twenty minutes while a pair of blue jays dive bombs them. It was a little surreal watching the massive bird finally fly away.        By the time I made it back home, I realized by footwear mistake. The skin on the backs of my heels had ripped off. I have been wearing flip flops almost exclusively for the past three weeks. I figured they would heal by now no problem, but Sunday I realized my feet were in dire need of some help - and they got it in the form of epsom salts and liquid bandaids. Thanks to everyone who came in or sent cards for graduations!",,View Entry,"May 22, Sun",0
Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535007,"We have had beautiful weather and and great trails for the entire trip! (okay one day). It was hot but beautiful up on the ridgelines. Hiking today was unusual for me. We leapfrogged a pair of section hikers, lumberjack, and a couple on their first backpacking trip. He carried 2.5 gallons of water and his pack weighed 60 lbs! But the army guy handled it better than we did our little-only-by-comparison packs. It was and unexpectedly great day. Bucky's family left some glittering trail manic in the form of fresh fruit, dozens of chips, and some much needed ginger ale. It was truly a beautiful sight. We wandered 13 miles today and got into camp around 6:45 and the first thing we did was cool our glorious Pad Thai -so delicious! Oh yeah - we also saw a rattle snake! Mom did not think it was nearly as cool as I did.","Deleware Water Gap

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535223,"Day 2:Still great weather for the entire trip. But it's hot and humid. We drink a ton but sweat so much we rarely have go pee. We hiked pretty much alone today but there was a great crew at the shelter. The girls almost outnumbered the guys which is pretty rare. Cooked some couscous and seasoned it with curry and onions - it was incredible. Last night was relatively interesting. I drank out of the camelback before going to bed and woke up in the middle of the night with an ear full of water! The camelback valve somehow got under my ear as I slept and spilled all over my pad and sleeping bag. I woke up through the night and wringed out water. Around two am I still,felt something wet and cold so I tried to wring it out and brush it off. Turns out it was massive centipede!","Rattlesnake Campground

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535378,"Hello heat! It's been a great day but I'm glad that I can handle heat. I swear every sweat pore went on pressure washer mode but it made the breeze and cool stones on the top of sunrise mountain that much more appreciated. In the morning, I checked one thing off the Appalachian trail,bucket list; I saw a bear! Actually two black bears running away from me (do I smell that bad?) After going a few miles in the morning we came to a couple of stores. Nothing was open except a small sports store where we bought a couple of sodas and saw Gyp's Tavern with a hammock and some nice chairs next to a lake with a breeze. The owner of the place came up to us asking if we wanted to sit there then offered us a free beer. We said no, mostly because it was 9 I'm the morning! But he brought us water and when my mom tried to give him $5, he gave her a bottle of BlackBerry brandy.After making it to machipacong shelter, we shared the drink with zip tie, morning star, and groundhog who we have been hiking around for the past few days. Mom finally got her trail name from Zip-Tie: Brandy. Great day on the trail yet again!","Brink shelter

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535449,"I tried to remember a time when I needed a shower more than today. My body was covered in layers of dirt, sweat, deet, dirt, sweat, deet, and heavenly-smelling lemon pomegranate hand sanitizer. Bringing that wanted sanitizer may have been the best decision we made.This morning we left from Mashipacong pretty early but not before Zip-Tie gave me my trail name. A friend gave me this really cool pair of captain America socks that I've been excited to wear for four days - perhaps too excited so she gave me the name Marvel! It's the little things in life. It was hot hike in; I couldn't even go out to the vistas because anywhere not in the shade is an inferno. However, I did have a staring contest with a deer and sat and watched the chipmunks run around. Brandy and I got to High Point visitors center around 11 but the hotel couldn't bring us to town and the taxi was only for elderly people in medical emergencies so we resorted to hitchhiking. New Jersey is terrible for hitchhikers - it took 40 minutes for two smiley (but smelly) girls to get a ride but it was worth it. The guy was amazing and drove us out of the way straight to our hotel!We hit the Wal-Mart and and going to visit the diner 3 times while we are here. I love fresh coffee!","Mashipacong shelter

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535729,"After breakfast at the diner we got a interesting taxi back to High Point State Park and started our hike. It was gorgeous; we made it to the highest point in New Jersey and saw the memorial tower miles in the distance later in the day. On about day 2, Brandy got a pretty good sized blister on her pinky toe so we've been trying to the care of it. We stop every two hours or so to take shoes and socks off (and nap). As we were resting, taking up the entire trail, a day hiker walked by and stoped to talk to us. We are so glad that he did! We talked for 20 minutes about life, the trail, ect., then he gave us his phone number and offered to let us stay at his house. The last few miles into Unionville were hot, but beautiful, through farmland but what was even more beautiful were the garlic knots in the Italian place in the tiny town. A ton of the thru hikers we've met turned up in Unionville and our tents made a mini-city but they still tented in the rain last night. Mick, the incredibly nice guy that we met on the trail, and his wife, Joyce, felt bad for us and picked us up to go back to their home for a roof, laundry, and a shower. They are the absolute definition of trail angels! They've done this for a bunch of other hikers and have made long lasting friendships. (They even had a book dedicated to them by a hiker they helped!) Mom and I loved talking to them and LOVED breakfast the next morning. Biscuits, cheesy eggs, bacon, and sausage: we were in heaven. We will never forget their kindness - such awesome people! Loving the Trail!","Port Jervis

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535752,"We said goodbye to our trail angels today and left with extra biscuits. It was kind of late when we started and we wanted to do a couple of half days so we just hiked for a couple of hours today. Some of the rolling fields we hiked through were covered in purple and yellow flowers. The trail turned into a thin boardwalk for about a mile over a swamp. I feel bad for and appreciate everyone who put in a trail over a poison ivy swamp.
There wasn't water at the shelter so we grabbed 4 liters each before climbing the half mile to Potchuck. Holy. Crap. It was so heavy. The plan is to work on reducing weight once we get into Fort Montgomery. 
A southbound hiker drew a map to a quarry with cold cool swimming water near the shelter back at Murray's place. Brandy and I searched for it for about a mile and a half and we did find this pretty large lake with reddish water, not a nice swimming mile. We wandered back to the shelter in our crocs and had a great time talking to the other hikers. One of them, Starbucks, was especially nice and gave me a pad to protect my sleeping pad.","Unionville

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535957,"This morning was beautiful; it has cooled down a bit (so low 80s) but the lower humidity made the morning climbs easier. The AT put in a wide boardwalk that spanned about a mile with a suspension bridge. We stopped in the middle for bagels with babybel cheese and pepperoni and conversation with Starbucks.After going through a cow pasture, the trail came near a garden center with FOOD. Mostly imporantly, they had the item I crave every hike: watermelon! We picked up a drink and a little lunch then went to pay when the checkout girl said that Starbucks had paid for our food! Thank you! Next on the agenda was the Stairway to Heaven. It wasn't as bad as it sounds but my calf muscles were grumbling their protest. The view from the top,was incredible and well worth the climb. Somebody and carved a heart into a pine tree at the summit but it ironically killed the tree.Not long after, we met Bright Side. I automatically liked him, he had a fantastic positive attitude and the first thing he did when he saw me working on my feet was to give me super sticky breatheable tape complete with extra. We walked and talked and laughed the rest of the way to the shelter and he continued on. At one point, We stopped and waited for Brandy along the side of the road for 15 minutes and when he stood up to leave he laughed. We sat next to a cooler full of trail magic for 15 minutes! Oh well, We drank cold tea and Pepsi for antother 15 minutes.and it's always Pepsi, not Coke, is that a New Jersey thing? It's a girls party in the shelter tonight with us and Magic.

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536197,"Conquered an entire state! New jersey! (disclaimer: conquered is too strong of a word). We leaped (literally) into New York but New York decided to make a name for itself. For the most part, upper New Jersey had been a dirt path scattered with rocks -easy hiking. A couple of feet into NY, the part reached the highest point in the state then stayed on this rocky ridge. We pulled ourselves and our packs up rocks for hours. Luckily, mom my agreed that this was fun hiking! We couldn't stop for too long because I was on a deadline. The hot dog stand closed at 3 but there was a homemade ice cream store right down the road. There was no question. We were getting there. It was so delicious!!!! They get the cream from the cows on the property. I was torn between peanut butter swirl 19th chunks and vanilla with raspberry swirl and dark chocolate so I got both. So many good life decisions were made here. The last few miles to the shelter were easy, then interesting. We climbed the pinnacles 17th were this giant collection of rocks. My poor mom, she does not like cliffs but she actually liked the adventure after It was over. I could tell she liked it because she didn't throw rocks at me! (and she said so)
Magic said something to me last night that stuck out. How often are you in a place where everyone there wants to be there? Not just wants, but is willing to pay good money and seriously suffer without any tangible payoff. At work and school, there are place most pair would rather be. But here, we are surrounded by hikers who are thankful to be exactly where there are.","Wawayanda Shelter
",Wildcat Shelter,"Jun 01, Wed",12.10
Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536453,"We got started early this morning (6:45 instead of 7). The guide book warned us that ""despite the unimposing profile, rocks and abrupt ups and downs make this section challenging."" The trail lived up to that promise but those steep inclines and rocky decents were lined with mountain laurel about to bloom.About 50 feet off the trail in the mountain laurel was the biggest bear I have ever seen! He was almost as tall as I was and he knew we were there but he continued on his business instead of running away which was moderately terrifying. I met a girl, Wonka, who saw 5 bears that day. A mother and her two cubs kept running down the trail in the direction she had to go and she wasn't totally comfortable talking to herself so she sang all day to let the bears know where she was. A guy hiking behind he helpfully added that she only knew one song. At about 10 miles, Brandy took a taxi into Fort Montgomery a day early and I caught up with Magic who we had been hiking with all day. The trail turned up to open forests with soft grass as far as we could see then a giant lake popped up. Magic looked at me and said ""Let's go swimming!"" It was lateish and we still has 3 miles to go but what other time am i going to be able to do this? I ditched my pack behind a bush, changed, and jumped in. The water felt marvelous! It was warm and we swam around the lily pads and damselflies. I booked it back to the shelter - all I wanted to do was eat. All I remember from those miles was ""lemon squeeze"", an tight gap, and hardcore daydreams of creamy Mac and cheese for dinner. There were resting solo women in the shelter which was pretty cool but the Princeton kids were the real MVPs of that night. There were about 8 of them on a backpacking trip training on how to take the incoming freshmen on 6 day trips. About 800 of the ""froshes"" choose to do the preorientation. Did I find all of this out because they were fun to talk to or was it because I knew they had extra quinoa with beans and cheese? Yup. The cheese. Cheese is worth its weight in gold on the trail. It's delicious and high in fat/calories. The highest calorie to weight ratio food is olive oil. I've seen guys who have lost so much weight that they are carrying Gatorade bottles of oil and drown their couscous in the stuff. I'm definitely not at that point and have been loving all of this food. So much food! We saw a giant bearIt gave my mom quite a scareBut the bear, he just didn't care","Wildcat Shelter

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536515,"Yesterday my legs were tired. My body is used to doing things like this but not for so long. After a week, my legs realized that I planned to torture them long-term and they started a protest. My feet and ankles joined in the demonstration but after a solid sleep, I was feeling good. It was 15.5 miles to the town but I could split it up into a 8 and a 7 mile day so I would just see how I felt. But I got to the shelter by 10:30 so I had lunch at the top of the mountain in the clouds and continued on feeling great. It rained for a few hours in the morning but the rain felt fantastic after so many hot days. Totally missed the NYC skyline but I guess mother nature wanted me to stay in the woods. It was a gorgeous hike with mountainsides full of the white-pink flowers, toads, and deer. By the time I got to the top of Bear Mountain my feet had rallied up a protest and I saw a magical sight - a vending machine! I sat across the path from the Pringles and powerade and took of my pack. Then my shoes. Then my socks. Then my desire to get up and walk to the vending machine. I sat there for a half an hour eating a pop tart from my pack but it was an interesting half hour. A deer came within 10 feet of my asking for my pop tart, I watched ants kill and dismemember some kind of larvae, and I talked with a really nice hippie who was manintaing trails. I walked down for bear mountain with Otis, a fully bearded thru hiker who started in JANUARY! We talked for an hour or so then walked through a park where we smelled barbecue! Three New York City girls had this gorgeous array of food and they motioned us over. It was one of the best hours of my life. Korean barbecue, hot dogs, grilled corn, chips and salsa, boursin cheese, and happiness. Otis and I kept looking at each other like ""how did we get so lucky!?"" We said goodbye to the city girls and walked through the zoo (the trail goes through a zoo!) then he continued on and I met mom at a hotel complete with a hot shower and a steakhouse across the street!One more fantastic day!

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/536726,"Started out pretty late with a cloudy hike across the Hudson River. Did we walk on water? If you count the rain, yes we did! Apparently Peregrine Falcons nest on the bridge which excited my love for the fastest birds in the world. Didn't see any, but I still have time. 
Coming off of the lowest point on the Appalachian Trail was, you guessed it, up. Once we reached the ridgeline, we walked through mile after mile of mountain laurel. It was almost like being in a wedding with the white flowers everywhere. The misty peaceful hike was accented with the sounds of target practice from West Point. 
It is supposed to storm pretty hard tonight so we opted to continue this R&R with a half day hike and an overnight at the monestary near the trail. 
At about a mile from our stop, we came out of the woods to a deli-general store with the best selection I've ever seen in such a small store. We spent an hour there eating and talking to two other hikers. One is named tow-truck and the other hikes with the nicest dog I've ever met (sorry echo!). I'm in love with Tanner and his sweet brown eyes and his ""love me"" attitude. Missing my pup. 
It was a great stay with the Friars but it was not at all monastic. Mom brought in a lime-a-rita and we watched a not-so-church-appropriate action VHS that was sitting there with another hiker. We went in search of hot water for dinner an met the kitchen staff. We were in the midst of making of freeze dried pad thai and tea when someone offered us salmon!

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537076,"Some people come out to the trail to see the wildlife; unless you're looking for a bear or snake -the Appalachian Trail is not the place. As far mamillian and avian life goes, I see much more in my backyard than here. But what suprised me was in incredible diversity of insects on the trail. At home, if you see a fly, you get the fly swatter or, if you see a spider, you grab a paper towel. Here, you are the minority and the space is not yours. We are in their forest. Flies eat the salt off my pants and it doesn't bother me anymore. If fact, I have 4 flies, 2 inch worms, and a tiny green bug on me as I am writing this post. Deet holds little power here.I always have about a dozen bug bites but it ceases to annoy me. It's fascinating seeing all the vibrant colors and intricate patterns on these pesky creatures. I'm sometimes shocked to see neon blue, red, green and pink next to each other on a caterpillar I've never heard of. Insects are the underdogs of the natural beauty contest. Back to pesky, I have a long term ""friend"". His name is blue and he is the gnat that incessantly circles my left eye. When there are more than one, they are the blues! I have learned to run and expertly blow them away at the same time. Will put that on my resume! Today was a sleepy day for me. The weather was perfect in the morning; cool with Sun and a strong breeze. That lasted a few hours before converting back to humidity. There was one area with low thick green plants. You could smell the sickly sweet sent coming off of them and feel their transpiration in the air. It was like walking through the field of poppies in the Wizard of Oz. I just wanted to lie down and fall asleep. We made it past the field of poppies and to a beaver pond. Because of all the rain, the water was flowing strong so we took it shoes off and dipped out feet in nature's Jacuzzi and leaned back on the rocks to take a lovely nap. Next step: food. We are bagels and honey at the beaver pond at watched all of the dragonflies chase each other. We finally traversed to the State Park where my insatiable hunger tore through the rest of today's food and considered ordering an additional hot greasy pizza. I've also been craving a powerade.

It was .7 miles back to the trail (off trail not included in mileage) but it took us an hour.it turns out there are about 8 people somewhat illegally camping by the beach. Jack and Jill and a few others got woken up by the police at 4 am! We've been hiking around David Miller and his gorgeous dog, Tanner for a few days and Tanner has always been a tired love sponge but this morning he was bounding around and running about having the time of his life! I love dogs. 
We met another dog on trail named Mikita with a bridle coat and beautiful eyes. I talked and walked with her owner for a while. Upon first meeting, he quoted by memory a page out of one of Henry David Thoreau's essays about Maine so of course the conversation lasted longer. He is a English Professor at a community college and teaches a class about music writing. Interesting people make for fast miles. 
We split at the RPH shelter and then it was another 5 miles to a pizza place and POWERADE. The water I got from the State Park was horrible and thick so I hadn't drunk enough. Getting to the deli and pizza place was amazing. I downed a liter of Gatorade in 3 minutes and inhaled mozzarella sticks and a calzone. Mom and I caved into our food coma and napped on the grass in the back. We left feeling incredibly content. 
After another 5 miles to the shelter, I walked in on a euchre game! Hopefully I'll find some partners for our own game soon. There's a giant group here; without a doubt it's the biggest we've seen yet. Met Frodo T-Baggins and Sweetfeet and a dozen others.","Clarence Fahenstock SP

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537306,"A late start to a great day today. As soon as I started hiking I knew that I was feeling great. I figured it was the Gatorade from yesterday but I didn't know if it was that additional hydration or the sodium for the muscle contractions. It wasn't my legs that noticed the improvement first; it was my brain. Now that I've recovered from the busy month of May and first few days my brain reverted back to 20 questions. What kind of fern is that? I love ferns! Does this fern have a different water vascular system than this one? Why are there so many kinds of moss on one rock? Won't one take over the rest? Is it a symbiotic relationship!? Is evolution really slow for trees? Does a longer lifespan lead to slower evolution? Why are pine needles so dark? Is darker green a more efficient light to absorb light energy? How do pine needles work! They can't be that efficient?Sorry for that paragraph, but it is just a taste of where my mind went today. The problem is, I have neither the mobile data nor the service to stop and google my questions. I find myself wanting my ten pound AP Biology textbook. Sort of. My brain wasn't the only body part benefiting from Gatorade; my legs were also happy and I hiked faster and it felt better. It also helped that we had the best terrain yet today. We hiked around two friends doing a section, Mr. Mean (nicknamed by his employees), and a father son duo named Sweetfeet and Frodo T- Baggins. I liked both of them and their humor and they told me to give them a call when I get to Virgina! Part of the trail crossed this impressive boardwalk through a swamp but it was a Mecca for wildlife. I was tons of wildflowers, two garter snakes, a great blue heron, and some of the biggest Jule weed I've even seen. Under threat of storms, we hurried into the Native Plant Garden Center and met an incredibly kind person working there and met our package... And a suprise package! Fran, a family friend sent us these phenomenal triple-chocolate biscottis. I swear I managed to eat 4 of them before the bag was even open. Thank you so so much! They're already almost gone and they have been shared with some happy hikers. Tonight we're at Tony's Deli eating breakfast food and a SALAD! The veggies have been sorely missed.","Morgan Stewart Shelter

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537408,"Do you know those fields in the movies? The ones with gold-green grasses littered with dozens of types of purple, yellow and white wildflowers? The ones where deer graze and swallows swoop in search of bugs. The ones where the sun breaks through and the protagonists ride their tall stallions into the new day across the rippling waves of grass. Yeah we walked through that field in southern New York. The only difference was that I was the horse. But I was a happy horse infused with coffee and a lemon poppyseed muffin. Wandering into woods, we were met by multiflora rose that had crawled its way up tree trunks to form columns of white flowers. The movie comparison was shattered soon after. I walked behind an older day hiker for about a half mile probably 20-30 feet behind him. With my trekking poles, I'm not a quiet hiker so I figured he heard me. Until he stopped in the middle of the trail to relieve himself right in front of me! After the initial shock, I ninja crept away and hid behind a tree. He never knew I was there. Hopefully. The weather today been phenomenal and I've been feeling really great so hiking is easy right now wich means I have plenty of time to wait for mom which means I have plenty of time to read. I can be a somewhat um obsessive reader. If I start an easy-to-read book, I tend to procrastinate homework and hide from people and all responsibilities until I finish my book. That's why I tend to choose books that I love, but can put down like books about lukemia and genetic testing or Steven Hawking's book, or modern aging. Last night I downloaded the Kindle app and got AWOL's book free. I have not been able to think of anything else. With a short day today, we are lunch at Wiley Shelter at 10 a.m. with four miles to our destination, Brandy and I would meet there so I took off feeling good. Within no time, I had made it to the top of Ten Mile Hill and it only being noon, I decided to stop. I watched the view and the clouds for a few minutes before giving in to the temptation of reading AWOL's book. A chapter later, the wind knocked me out of my book. I realized that this was my favorite weather: the temperature, the bright sun, and the strong wind all battle over the line between jacket and no jacket. The wind blew stronger and I stood up to feel it better and to let it push against me. It ripped across the leaves and pushed hard against the trees. On a whim I searches for a tree to climb. Conveniently behind the rock that I sat on was a large tree with three trunks. My feet got one each and my back the other and I shimmied up the tree. I looked directly down the hill to the mountains in the distance as the electric wind blew life into my body. My legs felt the tree pulse with the wind. This is how I fell in love with mountains. I don't mean to romanticize it, but there is so much energy here. I laughed into the wind then yelled, glad the wind took my voice away and that there was no one there to hear it. I jumped down in the middle of the healthy gusts and walked down the hill listening to the roar of the leaves above. 
The shelter is beautiful with the greatest privy I've ever seen. It even has a brass knocker and it oddly smells great. What doesn't smell so great are our clothes. Brandy and I wandered down the trail a bit with the perpetrators of the odor and Dr. Bronner's magic soap. We rock-jumped over to an island in the river then moved up to the hot rocks to wash out clothes like the Indians in the running river. In the middle of laudrying, I saw a tennis ball right next to my head. More accurately, I saw a beautiful but very old and very dirty golden retriever with a tennis ball in his mouth. He promptly sat on our newly clean clothes. We eventually found his owner then spent the rest of the day drying clothes, cooking, watching the mouse in the shelter, and talking to Mr. Mean. 
My legs are itching to do some more miles but it's been an exciting morning and a relaxing afternoon.","Pawling

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537771,"This morning started out cold and it was a struggle getting out of the sleeping bags (partially because of the cold and partially because my foot was stiff). Today had a bit of climbing to it but I kind of like it. I loved climbs in the beginning but that love has wanted a bit. I don't want to know exactly where I am, how much elevation I have to do, or what time it is. It's so much easier to hike when all your thoughts are on the path in the moment rather than thinking about how much further you have to go. There's an app, Guthook's maps, that is fantastic but I can't decide if I want it. On one hand it tells you exactly where you are and how far it is to the next anything and it very detailed. Brandy got it and I'm thankful that she did because it has saved her for getting lost many times. But I don't get lost like she tends to and would rather not know exactly how far and where every view is. There is something special about happening upon the unexpected and a little bit of adventure in the unknown. My stubbornness night prevent me from getting the app because I'm imagining the trail like an extended metaphor about life. I'm not always going to be confident in where I am but I want to grow comfortable and functional with self-doubt. I want to grow comfortable with being uncomfortable. Also, I don't need to spend $9 per section on another map when I already have two. I really enjoyed today's hike. I saw more garter snakes today than the sum total of all garter snakes I've seen in my entire life (excluding today if course). Even my mom, who hates snakes, thought they were adorable. They are yellow and black striped and small and are about as common as the milipedes were two weeks ago. Mom and I have been gradually going longer distances between meet-ups so we generally meet at the views which means I get to spend hours at overlooks. One of our meet ups was at Mt. Algo shelter where Mr. Mean also stopped. I probably spent two hours there by myself and with Brandy eating lunch, snacking, napping in the sun, and reading a book. We spent so much time that we missed the trail magic just down the hill! Towards the end of the day we hiked on and off with a brother sister pair who were incredibly nice. Within the last 3.5 miles we came down this ultra-steep incline that Brandy was not a fan of l. At all. Walking down it I easily imagined her face and her comment ""evil trail!"" but we made it down alive. The trial seemed to apologize and gave us two of the flattest miles we've had so far on soft ground next to a river. We made it into camp probably the latest yet but we also met Lucky 70. When she was getting to be 70 years old, she decided she better do something cool with that year so she decided to backpack the AT in Maine, one of the hardest states. Now she is 74 and is backpacking all of the states in New England because she likes the mountains. It's women like her that give me hope for growing old. I refuse, at 18, to be old and decrepit so I will simply hike till I die. I love to walk and I'd much rather go walking than stuck in a bed watching television and playing bingo. Honestly, the most intense athletic people I've met are older and retired and are my inspiration today and in 70 years.","Ten Mile River Shelter

The morning started off chilly and I really didn`t want to dip my hands into the cold stream to get water but hot tea is absolutely worth it.Brandy and I are working out a system where she gets off the trail a day before town so I can hike longer distances faster. She had a hotel in Cornwall Bridge and it was only 10 miles between shelters so I decided to go into town for lunch with her. AWOL never lead us astray until today. We ended up walking 2 miles and ending up .2 miles down the AT and still not in town. Two very nice but very unhelpful girls in a car asked us for directions and were oblivious to our not so subtle hints about getting a ride so we walked another mile into town. As we headed down the road we had just climbed, it started to sprinkle, then rain, then downpour. We jogged over to the gas station and probably stayed for an hour or so drinking coffee, eating breakfast sandwiches and everything else we could get our hands on, and having a fun conversation with the attendant and a limo driver with a broken shoe. Fact of the day: electrical tape does a fantastic job at repairing black dress shoes. We were soon joined by two Indian motorcyclists trying to escape the rain and we successfully took up the entire store. The attendant told us that the rain wouldn`t stop until 9 p.m. so I was convinced to stay at the hotel. On the dash through the rain to the Hitching Post we scored a free beer at the Package store and Brandy found another bottle of the Blackberry Brandy her name derived from. We also stopped at the River Outfitter which had nothing for backpackers but some really interesting really old books. Not ten minutes after we had changed clothes, blasted the heater, and hid under the blankets, the rain stopped and the sun came out. While we used the sun to dry our tent and gear, it did make me regret my decision to stop after only four miles. However, I absolutely do not regret the southwestern burger from the General Store.","Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537950,"To make up for yesterday, I got on the trail by 5 in the morning. Actually, trail isn`t the correct word, I still had a mile road walk up the trail then the plan is to do 12 miles where I will meet Dad and little Bro at the bridge two miles from Falls Village. They made it to Port Jervis from Ohio last night and picked mom up in the morning for breakfast. I set off from the Hitching Post to a foggy but humid morning and by the time I made it 5 minutes up the AT, I was already dripping with sweat. The perspiration was well worth it as I finally saw the morning sunlight as I crested the ridge to the East side of the mountain. My favorite time of day is right after the sunrise and right before sunset when the light seems thicker and pinker. I can remember being at my grandparent`s house in Massachusetts where the sunsets over the river were spectacular. But it was the light that really fascinated me. I marveled at how a low sun could turn my hair and skin a soft rose gold and turns her garden into a glowing patch of flowers. This morning is the same and the light gives the moss a slight gold tint. As I continue up and down and up and down, the gold gives way to sunlight and I vow to have more of these early morning starts. The featured animal for today are the adorable orange spotted salamanders. I must have seen 20 of them today and I love them! The trail took turns treating me to soft beds of pine needles and torturing my balance with wet marble but overall, it's a great rolling dozen miles. I`m hiking towards my family and am really excited to see them. I made it the 13 miles by around 10 am and while the family was still at breakfast, they had left a cooler full of trail magic right where we were to meet! I sat on a real chair with a book and rootbeer in hand until they came all wearing sunglasses - I missed the memo!We visited Kent (by car!) and bought some delicious cheese and hiked another two easy miles before restocking and heading to a spacious hotel.

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538079,"My dad, bother, and I hiked southbound from Mt. Everett to Salisbury (about 13 miles) and I was planning on finishing Connecticut afterwards.Today was absolutely beautiful for hiking! It was cool, breezy, and sunny. After a few good climbs, we were treated to the best view I`ve seen so far. After another mountain, we had a half a mile along an open ridge with sweeping views until we finally ducked into the woods to walk in a pine forest then meander along the clearest stream I`ve seen so far. The trail then crosses into Connecticut from Massachusetts and Ryan and Dad seem to think that they have ""bagged two states"". They walked in two states. There is a difference. Connecticut gives its last statement with a pull-yourself-over-the-rocks climb to the top where some crazy people built a massive rock pile. We enjoyed the wind and the view from the top with Mr. Nature and Pup and Pappa P then started down the long gradual decent into Salisbury. A fun rock scramble to the top a a mountain without packs? A long gradual decent on dirt path? Open ridge walks! Where is the green tunnel and PUD I know and love? I`m concerned that my family thinks too well of the AT. The animal feature for today is a mountain goat: my brother. He spent the entire time jumping up the trail ahead of us then sprinting down the mountains then waiting for us on the rocks seemly asking ""what took you so long?"" While he was always up front, by the end he was definitely tired and a little grumpy. Luckily, Brandy was not far away waiting for us with real chairs, chips, spiced gumdrops, and GUAC! We stayed there for a hour before Dad and I went out for the last 8 miles back to Falls Village. My fears about him not seeing the true nature of the AT were abated but the walk was beautiful though the fern covered woods. It was a lot of fun hiking with him and talking the entire time.

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538385,"Last night, I ate until my stomach hurt and when I woke up the next morning, the stomach pain from my gluttonous fiesta was still there. Mom offered me one of her finds from yesterday that I couldn't turn down: yogurt. After a little more gluttony, I realized that my stomach pain was just hunger! After a fantastic continental breakfast we made plans for the next six days. We will be averaging about 11 miles which is frustrating but being on the trail helps. Mom and I said goodbye to the boys. We’re going to miss them (and all of the food they brought). The trail started with a steep descent and then apologized with a nice long rolley couple of miles on pine needles. I was knocked out of my worrying about pace by an unusual croak. It was so unusual that I stopped to look and there was this pale orange fairly large frog hopping along. Where he stopped I spotted some long black and yellow stripes and realize the frog literally hopped within an inch of a garter snake. I watched the snake slither around to the back of the frog, rear up, then after a while, strike and latch onto this poor frog. I didn't stay long enough to find out how the snake managed to eat the frog but I left feeling immensely grateful for my position high on the food chain.To get to the shelter, we had to climb then hike the ridge for another few miles. I got really hungry so I stopped to raid my food bag. After trail mix and fruit snacks, I went for a Cliff Bar. Out of curiosity, I looked at the nutrition facts and thought “260 calories! That's it? I know little pies that weigh half that and have twice the calories!” I used to think that 260 was huge and now I just want to eat everything.It turns out the view off of East Mountain was right out of view of where we had been eating. So of course we stopped again but were met by Dark Water, Blaze, and Hannah Solo. Dark Water knew us and had experienced the generosity that is Joyce and Mick. It was a long 2.5 miles back to the shelter (longer for the guys that had just backpacked 24 miles) but the building was really big and unusual and apparently the porucpines liked it. We opted for a porucpine-free tent spot with a view and watched the sun down from our bug-free tent. We really enjoyed eating couscous with pine nuts, ramen noodles, and pesto sauce and learning what other hikers brought.

I walked through swamps going back to U.S. history sophomore year to remember the pre-constitution debacle. When we finally got to the monument, I stood there in shock. This was not monument! This is a mid-sized rock! Shay’s Rebellion mid-sized rock would be more appropriate. The disappointment got me thinking about the value of education. At least I knew enough about importance of the rebellion to be moderately outraged by its pathetic memorial. I've taken a whole 1 AP Biology class yet it has totally changed how I think about my natural surroundings. This is a big deal because all I do all day is look at my natural surroundings. If I had a plant biology degree or a geology education, I would think so differently and this would be a totally different journey. Different backgrounds lead to entirely different ways of thinking. I can’t imagine this walk without education. Even the words I think have been taught to me by someone else. Some things you learn naturally. For example, I used to hunt for salamanders in brooks and under wet rocks. Since then I learned that some salamanders live temporarily on dry ground and today, while lunching at a large beaver pond, I noticed fully aquatic salamanders with tails built like fins. The lake featured hundreds of the giant dragonflies in all different colors. This lake also featured a nap in the sun.We planned to meet up at the shaker campsite so while I was waiting for mom, I met fesque, a really interesting man that does the grass for golf courses all over the world.

And guacamole. And Indian food. Today we just did nine miles and we met Toast and two other guys at the gas station. I got to wall behind them for a few miles. I had pacers! My pacers stopped so I continued on to a large pond. The blaring croaks of the bullfrogs made me stop to see if I could find one but once I got down to the lake, I barely bothered to look. There were so many dragonflies! But this time my skin looked the color of the log peeking out of the water so dozens of them landed on my shoulder and my hand like living jewelry.

One of them was Cheeky Monkey (trail name comes from the incident were a monkey stabbed him with his own knife and then jumped on his dog and rode off on India). He was a professional adventure athlete turned middle school English teacher who lived all over the world. We also met a French Canadian who is hiking at 70 years old and speaks decent, but slow English. I asked what brought him here and he said meditation and that he also writes a French Haiku a day. It's easy to see that he could be quite the romantic. We didn't leave the ice cream shop for another 4 hours.

It was a mile well spent as it ended in cheesy bread, fresh greens, and most importantly tiramisu!

They're the easiest place to get lost and the least fun terrain but luckily, they are few and far between. On this particular accidental road wall we happened upon the most hardcore stereotypical haunted house I've ever seen. And someone lived there (check the photos tab)! The trail went uphill from there both literally and figuratively. Today was 100% the climb up Greylock but while the elevation profile was scary, it was a fantastic and not-too-difficult climb. On the way, I met Merlin and his Boston Terrier Monkey. He is flying up the trail vegan which means lots of mail drops! Because he lives only a few miles off trail, he and his hiking family are going to take two zeros and he gave us the low-down on the area and where to shop.

Only a few minutes out of the shelter, the terrain changed from lush green to short knobby alpine trees giving off that strong wonderful pine scent. It’s my first sneak preview of the White Mountains which I'm incredibly excited to reach. Less than a mile from the top, I stopped to talk to what I thought were two day hikers. It turns out they were trail maintainers. With too many hours in the day, I decided to stay and help them. I can't say I was much help but I did throw some logs and hammer in some giant nails! It was great talking to them and putting in a tiny piece of the trail. Up at the top, the views are great but the showers and mattresses are divine.

As a general rule, uphill is so much kinder to your body than downhill.It was a half mile roadwalk to the Stop and Shop and it was worth every step. It was a real grocery store with beautiful food for normal people (hiker selection is okay). We stocked up and bought a container of fresh fruit and a bag of fried chicken. On the way out I stopped at the Papa John’s and got $1 pizza by the slice for “Tasty Tuesday”.

I argued with myself about stopping after a 2 ½ hour stop but compromised between going on and jumping in entirely clothed by sticking my feet in.  The climb up wasn't steep except for one section. This part had a “bad weather route” which never means flat east trail. I hadn't seen any hikers all day so I wondered if I would have the shelter to myself. I couldn't have been more wrong. There were dozens of tents and seven people in the shelter. Five of them were just starting the Long Trail, one was me, and the other was Hannah Solo!

We sped-walked down to Friendly’s for breakfast and for the third meal in a row, my mom and I independently decided on the same meal!I decided to keep going and to meet mom and the grandparents in Manchester Center so I got a ride from the hotel owner and started up the trail.   It was a fairly steep climb up and I started thinking about trail legs. Trail legs are these mythical magical calves and thighs of rock hard muscle that propel their wearer up mountains without complaint. I do not have trail legs. Sometimes I think I still hike as well on day 1 as I do now. That changed when istarted thinking about Polar Bear and his pace. I hadn't realized I could keep up with someone going that fast but it wasn't hard, it was just different. Then I wondered, “can I keep that kind of pace myself?” The trail was phenomenal. It was always hilly but the grade was moderate and started flying up and down then up then back down again. I moved fast enough to get a side stitch! Old me would never have been able to do what I did that morning. New me did have to wipe salt crystals off her face and neck from so much sweat. I'm in love with the Green Mountains! Goddard shelter was about 10 miles from where I started and I made it there in under in 4 hours and I stopped to talk to a ton of people (okay, it was 3 groups). After 10 miles, I slowed the pace but I still felt good at the end of a 19 mile day, If you're a day hiker, it's a 50-50 chance that I’ll stop and talk. If you have a pack, that chance goes up to maybe 85%. If you have a dog, there's an approximately 99.9997% chance I’m stopping to say “hi!” to your dog. I miss my mutt! There are quite a few trail dogs out here do I never have to go too long without seeing a happy tired puppy with terrible breath. I reached the shelter,I originally planned to stay at by 2:30 so I ate for an hour there and downed a liter of lemonade then went to the next shelter only 4.6 miles away.Big 0, six legs and Calvin (his dog), Brawny, and a couple of long trail hikers were at the shelter, all of whom I've never met before. It was great meeting so many new people but I only was off trail for a day and a half and now the log books are full of new names.","Bennington

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539767,"June 25 Notes:All three of us in the shelter (Brawny, Big O, and I) got up early. I saw Big O again at the top of the not-so-stable fire tower atop Stratton mountain. This one didn't have cables securing it but the view was incredible and we could see all the ski slopes. Heading down Stratton, Big O literally ran past me to Manchester Center chanting “Pizza! Burgers! Pizza! Burgers! Fries!” By 10:00, I had already hiked 10 miles and could only go 8 more. If I went one mile an hour I would still get to camp early so that's what I did. It felt kind of like I was hiking for something to do rather than because I wanted to rest or be at the shelter. I crossed this footbridge over a beautiful mossy and rocky brook but the water was orange and foamy. I dropped my pack and myself of one of the bigger rocks then pulled out my map but some movement caught my eye. It was a salamander stumbling slowly over the rocks. I looked around and within a few feet of my rock, I saw at least a dozen of these awkward creatures climbing upstream. Some climbed over my boot and one really cute on even fell off my trekking pole. I looked closer and realized that they had orange spots on their backs. Remember the Red Efts? These guys in seeing today will spend two years in the water then turn bright orange and live away from the streams. Either way, they are ridiculously slow and awkward walkers like toads and I'm impressed they are evolutionarily successful. Creatures that are too evolutionarily successful at the biting flies. My 100% Deet says that it repels those vicious beasts but this is a lie. A terrible lie. On the other hand, the Spruce Pine Shelter was phenomenal. The water source was the best I've ever seen and the place had real glass windows! And it,even had a sliding door with an outdoor and an indoor picnic table. It was the perfect place to spend my one month trail anniversary. To celebrate, we had dinner for two. I ate it all!Because this shelter was so close to the road, Brawny and I had the place to ourselves. She is a seasoned hiker who has done the AT already, the PCT, most off the CDT, was a ridge runner in Maine, and had worked in National Parks. She has some incredible stories about her adventures and some terrifying ones about the bucket of death (highly effective mouse trap).","Story Spring Shelter

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540182,"I woke up excited this morning because I the plan was to Nero to Manchester and meet my mom and my grandparents there. The meet time was 7:30 and it was only three miles so I didn't get out of bed until 5:30. Brawny somehow got ready in 10 minutes and was out. This is very impressive. Luckily, both mom and I showed up a half and hour early. She looks (and smells) really great. The antibiotics worked miracles!We drove back to Bennington where I showered far too quickly and then the whole family went out to breakfast. I inhaled an omelette, home fries, and a corn muffin. The food saga continued with our official celebration of Mom’s birthday by bringing cake and ice cream to a park close to our room. For mom, this birthday was a significant improvement to lyme disease misery. The food saga continued yet again when we went to a Mexican restaurant at had something other than pizza off trail! I love pizza, but town food has been almost exclusively pizza and breakfast food. I ordered a quesadilla and it came out as a pizza. My grandparents brought a bunch of wonderful stuff but by far the best was this razor. My legs felt like dolphins and I was so happy to be done with this leg hair. It was only one day that I spent with the family but it felt like a week. I'm really appreciate that they came out and all the conversations we had...and not hiking! A quick shout out to everyone who signs the guest book and my friends and family for the support. Thanks!","Spruce Speak Shelter

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540185,"Mom and I got up at 5:30 and took off in search of cheese, fruit snacks, and breakfast. The gas station was the only place open but they had all of the above so I had a “real” breakfast of blueberry donuts and coffee. I left mom at the trailhead and started hiking officially on my own for the first time. Because I’d always imagined this journey solo it was kind of like starting again.Further into the hike, I was overwhelmed by how much time there is in the day. The sun rises at an ungodly hour and I pretty much want to be in bed two hours before it goes down. There's no other responsibilities or other people to worry about. I can just hike until I'm tired and hiking is all I can do. It’s a forced simple lifestyle. Let me correct myself; I can do more than hike, I talk to people. Almost all the time I love talking to other they hikers because you get deep and interesting fast. I met a guy with a Gandalf level beard climbing one of the ridges and 25 minutes later he was still explaining the concept behind email. I finally escaped to met another guy, White Buffalo, a few minutes later for some really interesting conversation. My first southbounder!!! He told me about the Whites and Maine and we swapped advice about the trail,to come. Halfway through the day it started to rain. For the past month, we've had phenomenal weather so I think mom was the good luck charm that kept the rain away. However, the rain wasn't terrible and I actually enjoyed the cool.I stopped for lunch at a shelter and and met up with Grandma and six legs (human and Calvin the labradoodle).  We hiked another five miles to Little Rock pond and I was going to stay at the shelter and they would move one but once the locals took over the shelter and seemed “on edge” as Six Legs put it. We moved in in search of a stealth site but did one better with a group site with a picnic table and tent platforms. Today was my longest day and my first 20! Maybe I should feel worse but I'm definatley not complaining","Manchester Center

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540194,"Running from the rain rarely works. This entire day, the forecast got amplified, pushed back, and flipped around. We knocked out about 13 miles before we,have up running from the storm and went a half mile off trail for a restaurant.Shocker, it was worth every step. I opted for the Hungry Hiker Special: french toast, bacon, eggs, homefries, toast. Still hungry, I ordered a medium mint chocolate chip ice cream.Apparently Vermont Maple Syrup is a huge deal; where have I been? I put it on my French toast, my toast toast, and the waitress taught me it can go on ice cream. Six legs even did a Vermont Maple Sugar shot with my leftovers.Those last 7 miles into the shelter were pretty rough. All of that lactose from my ice cream wanted to make a reappearance and the climb out from the road was painfully steep. I was stopping every couple of steps to breath and let my stomach settle. Now was a great time to pull out my iPod and because most of the songs are my little brother’s, they were dark intense songs. Great for mountain climbing. Those seven miles should have sucked but I was in a really great mood the entire time. I sweat more than I ever have in my life with five different channels of water sodium, potassium, and magnesium running down my face and dripping from my nose and flowing from my chin. I also accidently ran into a stump and busted my shin and the shoulder strap of my pack snapped out of its seams. Because of all the rain, a steam crossing that should have bee, a rock hop ending up being a river fording experience. I’m so thankful Brawny explained the process not three days ago. I unclipped my waist and chest strap then changed into my crockcrocks and slowly moved one appendage at a time (trekking poles count as appendages). With my feet wedged in the crevases between rocks, I felt stable the entire time despite the fast moving water.Not a tenth of a mile from the water source was the Governor Clement shelter and I've never been so happy to see a dry patch of dirt! There was a large group of chatty fun people who passed out at 7 and just didn't move or snore at all for the next 10 hours. For all the foretold weather drama, it barely rained and lacked the “violent winds.” Side note: couscous is AMAZING. Not only is it completely delicous and goes wonderfully with pesto and veggies, it had a real-ton (yes, that is the technical term) of protein.","Little Rock Pond

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540501,"Today is one of those days that I'll never forget.The morning started with 10.8 miles down (and up) to route 4 hiking with Grandma and Six Legs. They were going further but I had a package in Rutland that I needed to pick up so we said the customary goodbye “see you down the trail.”As we were walking, we saw this guy on the trail in dress pants and a nice shirt and tie. I dropped a couple of hints about needing a ride and he caught on. He had hiked the trail with his dog in ‘92 and was stopping by for memory's sake before a meeting. Rutland is amazing! Dozens of cute shops and restaurants line the street and the free Hiker Hostel is atop a deli and near a price chopper. Entering the yellow deli, happy women in long skirts offered me free drinks and took me upstairs to show me the gorgeous showers, the bunks, and the hiker hangout equipped with a kitchen. The Twelve Tribes run the deli and the hostel and around noon, one of the members came up and asked if anyone had time to help out with the lunch rush so seven of us went downstairs and did dishes and cooked food. I chopped lettuce and strawberries for three hours,with hootie, a marine biologist. After the rush, they gave us cheesy potato soup, homegrown salad, and bread at a gorgeous round table. The food and company was incredible. Most of the hikers there were zeroing and I can 100% understand why. In addition to a free bunk and shower, the twelve tribes also gave us free laundry. I never actually paid for food the entire time I was there. They invited the hikers to their gathering and to dinner afterwards and I couldn't pass that opportunity up. I donned a long incredibly comfortable long skirt and a plain shirt then four of us drove a few blocks to the community. They have a few houses that they share and in one of the homes, we joined a large circle of incredibly nice happy people.The concept started years ago when a group of people were unhappy that church was canceled for the Super bowl so they went to the park and had their own service and realized they didn't need a pastor or leader to celebrate God. Now, they are meshing the way of life of the original Twelve Tribes of Israel with modern society. There isn't a leader, they share everything, and they live with love. Back to the gathering! It started out with singing and dancing. Anyone would just start singing then the band would pick it up and some (including me!) started dancing in a circle. Then they said what they were thankful for then just talked about their ideas about the bible and God. They use a lot of Hebrew words.Dinner was delicious and fun talking to all the kids. Rice and lentils with salad! By the end, all the hikers were in such a good mood we offered to WALK back! We turned down a ride more than once! This is not a hiker norm at all. I said I spent no money on food (I sent myself a box) but this is not necessarily true. I wanted some sour patch kids so,I have Hootie and Alice a couple of dollars to get some from price chopper for me. I get back from the gathering and there is then gigantic 1.9 pound sack of sour patch kids on the table!I finally fall asleep happy and trying to pawn pounds of sour patch kids on people","Governor Clement Shelter

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540503,"My biggest trail regret yet is not staying at the Yellow Deli for free breakfast. Grits was cooking and both her parents are chefs and I really wanted a root beer. However, when the girlfriend of a hiker offers a free ride, you don't say no. She drove Dutch and Skittle and I to the trail. All of us just graduated high school which was pretty cool but they left me in the dusy 15 minutes into the first hill. Today was filled with too many short steep ups and downs. It was also filled with too many sour patch kids. Seventeen miles in, there is this awesome cabin with a platform on top of it with great views of the mountain. We could even see the Whites! NoBos (northbounders) have been looking forward to these notoriously difficult and beautiful mountains for months. The mood is nervous and excited. Many of them are trying to slow down so close to their goal realizing that their journey is almost over. As the privy poetry says, “It's not about the miles; it's about the smiles.” We all quiz the southbounder about the Whites and start figuring out how to get through these 4,000 footers. I really wanted to nero (near zero) into Hanover so I pushed on to the next shelter.

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540664,"Apparently if the first two words you say in the beginning of the month are “rabbit rabbit,” then you’ll have a good month. My first word was “huh?” when my shelter partner said it but maybe it still works after a “huh.”Maybe not. The first 5 miles were really tough for me. I walked so slowly and the terrain was up and down these steep hills. My calves burned and I really wanted to go back to bed. I even settled on just going 12 miles instead of the 20.Music and I have had a weird relationship on the trail. At home, I'm never without it and it's the thing I miss the most on my overnighter but I went the first two weeks without it and have just been saving an IPod just in case I was miserable. Yes my legs hurt, but I wasn't at all miserable. I just figured it was time so I pulled out the headphones and walked so much easier. The toughest hill of the day felt like the easiest. It’s incredible how mental pain is. At the top of a hill Ron Jon caught up to me which was perfect because I appreciated a pacer and some conversation. Ron Jon paced me right to organic creamery where we both annihilated a pint of the creamiest ice cream I've ever eaten. Coming down the hill after ice cream we saw two unicyclists and a dog riding on the road. Then they followed us up the Appalachian trail (this is technically illegal but mountain unicycling is a niche sport)! I cannot begin to describe how absolutely crazy you have to be to go mountain unicycling in the first place not to mention down these hills so steep I can barely walk down switchbacks, roots, and rocks. The moral of the story is that there is always someone crazier than you. Ron Jon and I walked together (pretty fast) partially to avoid the coming thunderstorm but I wanted to stop and was planning ways to break off of Ron Jon’s pace when we heard a bell ring. Randy and Linda, Trail angels, have a house almost on the AT and if they notice you, they’ll ring the bell and drown you in trail magic. Ron Jon and I got sodas and chili dogs and WATERMELON! And they have a loft to their shed/barn that they let hikers stay in so I easily decided to spend the night. For NoBos, you’ll see the shed/barn with a large black AT symbol on it as you cross the bridge. People jump off of this 30 foot bridge. I jumped off this 30 foot bridge! I've always wanted to cliff dive but never had and this was my chance! Randy went first and then I stood at the top staring 30 feet down into the water. Then walked off screaming. It was so much fun!!! Ghost Walker also showed up and when we went back to the house to,chat they invited us in for dinner of steak and potato salad! Their grandson is there and he is an adorable source of non-stop energy. We played around and read 101 Dalmatians.I might love Disney more than he does… That night Ghost Walker and I talked for a while; he is one of those people who is on their ninth life and has lead the most adventurous life I can imagine: the Navy, ultramarathons, and mountaineering and now a thruhike!","Wintturi Shelter

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540671,"With only 10 miles to go today, I slept in,until 6:00! However I didn't get on the road until 7. My feet are always tight in the morning and I think it's because of my orthotics. The good news is that I have no trouble with my plantar fasciitis but the bad news is that I can barely walk without my boots or my feet stretched out. My feet were so tight this morning and it hurt to put any pressure on them so I packed sitting the bed but my electronics were 7 feet away on the other side of the room. I couldn't walk so I crawled and pulled myself up onto a chair, collected my stuff, then prepared myself to walk. My feet allowed no more than pathetic three inch steps and halfway across the room I just started laughing. My inability to walk felt kind of ironic and I just didn't know what else to do. Once my feet stretch out, they're fine and they were 100% by the time I reached the woods. Mentally, I recharged to 100% by the time I left the woods. The morning glowed. All the water from last night’s storm heightened the color of the forest. Ferns and mosses seemed brighter and the trees darker and the colors more intense. Light beams shone through cracks in the lead cover and at the right angle, the misty beams were filled with rainbows.The walk in the woods was peaceful and beautiful but I also appreciated the road walk. Watermelon and banana bread greeted me in a cooler by the side of the road and there was even a 10 page booklet that someone put together for anything a hiker could possibly need in Hanover/Norwick. Between today and yesterday and all the free food in Hanover, I was just overwhelmed by kindness of strangers and smiled all the way into town. Town in NEW HAMPSHIRE!!! Five states down! In town I took advantage of the free donut and the free slice of cheese pizza. Around the post office there were a dozen hikers so I felt less like “hiker trash” and more part of the trail community. I went to lunch with Clothesline and Jan-go, a really cool couple, and devoured a giant burrito. I met mom a few hours later and had some strawberry rhubarb pie and a giant bowl of fruit then we went out to a late lunch of a Caesar salad, a burger, and fries. When my stomach finally realized how much I had eaten I was both impressed and in pain.

For gun, I start imagining these people trying to hike the Appalachian trail. The day was not totally lazy. Laundry was accomplished and the laundromat was next to a pet store so I got to play with puppies while the clothes were cleaning!I had one goal for the day: finding dory! Oh my god I love Disney/Pixar movies way to much. They're basically movies for adults marked for kids which a guaranteed happy ending. After the movie and some Mexican food we drove up to the Whites. A much needed shower later we decided to go out in search of gas station snacks but we ended up driving through the park as the sun was setting. These mountains blew my mind.

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541536,"This morning I got a late start: I7:30. I felt nervous hiking up to the Franconia ridgeline. Many years ago, when I was maybe 10, my dad, brother, cousin, and I did this loop and stayed at Greenleaf hut. Years later, I pinpointed that summit with the sun and the wind as the point when I fell in love with mountains. I slowly and carefully pick my feet up the rocks. My progress is slow but I never feel the need to stop which is pretty cool. The trip up is beautiful. Boreal forests are some of my favorites: thick hardy spruce and the trees seem strong and immobile but they are one of,the few bits of life to survive up here. The ground is almost void of dirt but you wouldn't be able to see it anyway because the rocks and almost entirely covered in vibrant green moss or colorful lichen. The climb doesn't give anything away until I break tree line then I get amazing views of the Presidential Range and valley below. I scramble up to the summit of Mt. Lincoln and look down at the trail that 10 year old Laura ran up. She didn't look the view until she got to the tallest rock so I do the same. For fifteen minutes I have the entire range to myself and I am glad for the solitude. The feeling of the sunlight being intensely close and the cold wind interrupting the sun is still the same as I remembered it when I was as tween. The ridgeline is long but not nearly as long as I imagined so I spend plenty of time sitting and enjoying the view. The climb down is beautiful, but it sucks.at one point, my pole get a stuck in the rocks and I fall hard bending my beloved trekking pole and scraping my knees and shins like a kindergartener. The trail turned steep coming off Mt Garfield and I wasn't used to this kind of trail so when the path joined with the water source and became a waterfall I thought “there's no way.” I waited for someone to come for a few then walked back to the campsite to see if the caretaker could verify that the AT went down a steep waterfall but I only found people more confused than I was so I swung my pack on and decided that “there is a way,” and it wasn't bad. It wasn't until late afternoon until I realized it was July 4th! I was excited to wish people “happy 4th!” instead of my customary “enjoy your hike!” The first person I wished happy 4th of July to looked at me and said, “I’m a Brit.” This Brit was incredibly interesting and we talked for a while back at Galehead Hut where I opted to do a work for stay. Oddly, there were only 9 guests and a bunch of friends of the crew up so there were tons of leftovers and not very much work - a combination I very much appreciated. A bunch of us stayed up way past hiker midnight which I paid for the next day but don't regret at all. One of the hutsmen, Greg, is studying molecular and cellular biology at Johns Hopkins and is doing amazing ophthalmic research and also spends an incredible amount of time in the mountains. This is good news. This is exactly what I want to do and he is proof that it can be done!","Nowhere

This was where I paid for my not sleeping and was exhausted three miles from the end but luckily a really tall athletic looking human walked by so I used him as a pacer. He was a climber who went to school in Alaska and now works in environmental science in DC. The back of his car was loaded with fresh fruit and smoothies and I lucked into one!

The are tons of people out, more than I've ever seen on the trail. Bubbles of NoBos and SoBos are meeting and atop of the thru hikers, there are Presidential Traverse hikers and day hikers. One of those day hiking groups passes me in polos and khakis! My hope was to see the people I said goodbye to a while ago and I saw Sin nombre again at Mizpah Hut! I hadn't seen him since NY and we both demolished some potato dill soup.A few times, the trail splits into two: one is nice and skirts the steep peaks and the other goes straight up them. Guess,which one the AT is? Wrong, the flat one! These are the 4,000 footers of the Whites, mountains I really want to climb, and the AT uncharacteristically decided to be flat just this time. My ego decides to climb Mt Eisenhower and Mt Monroe anyway and it was 90% worth it. I've never spent so much time about tree line and it's this unusual beauty where you are constantly faced with how far you've gone and how far you have to go Which are both impressive distances. Luck gave us the absolute perfect weather to climb the presidents and the views are otherwordly. The plan was to meet mom atop Mt Washington so she took the auto road up which absolutely traumatized her. Not only is it expensive to drive a thin, can't see the road steep, and fairly long road, but they give you a bumper sticker that says “this car climbed Mt Washington” which hikers virtually universally agree is just sad. What is not sad is that entire jar of salsa that we sped through at one of the AMC bunks. AMC stands for Appalachian Mountain Club and they do a lot of great work but we lovingly refer to them as the Appalachian Money Club charging $125 a night for a mountain bunk bed and two meals. Their stores and prices as crazy outrageous so they're always busy. AMC gives talks occasionally and I happened onto a bear seminar where the ranger vehemently promotes giant heavy bear canisters over bear bags. Sure, hanging the bags is hard, but those things are absolutely ridiculous for this kind of hiking. I’d like to see him lug that black hollow rock from Georgia to Maine","Misc. Campsite

Up on the ridgeline, the trees and plants are small and it's like walking through a forest meant for dwarves. Once up it was a mile down to Carter Hut and it's alpine lakes. There I saw Otis for the first time since we kicked onto a NYC picnic in NY. I also re-met Sergeant Pepper, a hilarious high energy Brit.

Of course we also went on the and factory tour and of course destroyed some amazing fresh ice cream.In the way back, we stopped at a rest stop to deal with and entire watermelon but alas, we were unable to finish it. As a hiker, it goes against my morals to throw away food, especially watermelon, so we tried to give it away and the first woman I offered it to was allergic to watermelon. Just as we were going to throw it away, we found a large Asian family to pawn it onto.Dinner that night was the greatest invention ever: pizza where the crust was garlic knots! The meal came with a side of victory as I crushed Andrew in a game of gin.","Hanover

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542921,"Andrew drove back home today and I had to go back out on the trail. Right as I started, we saw the same four guys again heading to a trail Angel breakfast. I was tempted to join, but already ate so much. Hiking today was not terribly difficult but it sucked. I am weak from all my zeros and slacking recently. Hikers welcome hostel was 10 miles down the trail and I stopped by there without a plan of where Is spend the night and got sucked in with no regrets. Its a really chill place and I saw deliverance for the first time there. Not sure if that was the best move. Hikers Welcome is pretty big and I needed up just tenting and staying up “late” talking to all the hikers there. Some had been there for four or five days.","Hanover

Moosilauke is generally considered the start of the Whites and has a long gradual uphill followed by a crazy steel downhill so many slackpack it SoBo. 
I stayed for breakfast then decided at 8 to not slack and just hike north with my full pack so I did Moosilauke the “wrong.”
On the way up I met the SoBo legend Homemade who made his pack and all of his gear. His backpack is made of wood and old shirts and is 100% badass. 
Towards the end of the climb, the grade turns gradual and you walk straight into the sound of music in Austria. Up at the summit, I met those four guys 
yet again slackpacking SoBo except this time the temp me to join them at their trail angel’s house with words like “fruit salad” “beds” and “Lord of the Rings movie marathon.” 
For a few miles I stress walk though my decision making process and make great time. I want to go really far today in hopes of making the morning shuttle to Gorham the next morning. In the end, I realize there's not really a decision to make so I try and call one of the guys, AK, but I'm roaming so I have to call verizon support to get his number. 
It works out and I get a shuttle south then get picked up by two sisters so are the daughters of the first two people I met on the trail, Santa and Wonder. 
When I first get there, the guys are at Wal-Mart so I shower and come downstairs to witness this absolutely awe-inspiring fruit salad. It’s easily the best one I've ever seen and paired well with good company and good food.
“Lord of the Ring movie marathon” turned out to be most of the first movie which was about all I could stay awake through. I sleep so well out here and especially well on an actual bed!
Thank you so much to the entire family!","Hiker's Welcome

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545670,"First entry in a long while: I promise I haven't died, or worse, gotten off trail! Right now I'm in the air conditioning of my grandparents house enjoying blueberry pie and triple ply (toilet paper). What happened between then and now? I had jumped ahead and hiked the Whites from Franconia Notch to Gorham (end of NH) supported by my mom but then had to fill in the gap between Hanover (beginning of NH) and Franconia Notch. Hiking that section, I met up with AK, Swede, Unknown, and Rocky and apparently I liked them so when it came to the point where I was supposed to catch a bus around the Whites that I already backpacked/hiked, I just kept walking with them. Absolutely no regrets repeating the Whites! AK, Swede and I went into Lincoln to resupply and had a horrible time hitching so by the time we made it back to the trail we were destined for a nighthike. The best part of nighthiking is seeing sunsets from amazing places. There is no better example than the phenomenal sunset atop my favorite ridgeline. We were the only three people there and it felt like we were the only three people in the world. Okay, we did have to run a few miles to get below treeline because of the approaching thunderstorm but the sunset was worth it. Hiking with my trail family meant more nighthiking than I've ever done in my life. We hiked up Mt. Washington to Lakes of the Clouds Hut without headlamps under a full moon. We climbed the Mahoosuc Arm as the sun turned the sky pink. We stealth camped atop a Maine mountain and saw both the sunset and sunrise. More happened than I could possibly write about but I`ll try to keep it short. AK and I slackpacked once and pulled away from Rocky Swede and Unknown then we pushed hard for a while because AK had a deadline. We hiked a 23 over the Bigelows which deserve my #2 favorite mountain range of the trail then did a 21+ mile day then a 25. Then I was tired so I decided to take my time with the 100 mile wilderness which meant saying goodbye to AK. The rest of that day in Monson was lazied away at Shaw’s with kayaks and great company.I loved Southern Maine but I’m obsessed with the hundred mile wilderness. Four or five miles into it we (Stretch, Truthpick, and I) happened upon a pristine Maine pond with an island in the middle that just looked at me and said “swim out here.” You know you've been in the woods too long when an island starts talking to you but I listened and we all swam out into the perfect bathwater-temperature pond to the island covered in blueberry bushes. The only way it could have been more quintessentially Maine is if there had been a moose. That set a immovable precedent of swimming at every good opportunity. Just before the wilderness, AK and I had a conversation with a tent set up by the trail (yes, there was someone in it). It turns out that someone was the other female solo just-out-of-high-school flip-flopper that I had heard about since NY. Just Right and I ended up having the same schedule and we sheltered/camped at the same place every night through the 100 mile ""wilderness.""One of these nights, we tented on the beach of Lower Jo-Mary Lake. That morning, I woke up for the sunrise over the lake at 5 a.m., reached my arm out my tent, took a picture, then went back to bed. Laying there half-asleep I saw a huge brown blob wandering towards my tent. Without my contacts, anything 5 feet away is hopelessly blurry so when I unzipped my tent and saw a massive bull moose in full clarity I stared in shock. He splashed into the lake and wandered down the shoreline as I whispered, “Just Right. Just Right! There's a moose outside your tent!” Best. Wake up call. Ever. The next two days are some of my most relaxed hiking days. Just Right and I stopped to eat and relax more than we hiked. We swam, I talked to just about everyone, we cooked so many hot meals, and ate a ridiculous amount of blueberries at Rainbow Ledges. I realize just how glad I am to be taking a gap year. People back home think what I’m doing is tough and it is, but I'm really just on an 6 month vacation and loving it. By some miracle, after a week of no communication and virtually no plan, my mom showed up at Abol bridge half an hour after I did. My mom and drove to a campground then visited the AT Cafe for breakfast where we discovered the magic that is squash donuts. At a dollar per massive (and heavy) homemade donut I bought a dozen and pawned them off on Hail, Claudia, Mink, and Just Right who all summited on the 10th with me. After a 10 mile day to the Birches, Just Right and I got up at 3:30 and were on the mountain with Mink by 4:30. Getting up early was 100% worth it: we avoided the crowds and the mountain gives a different experience in the early morning. We peaked up above treeline in the morning light and I’m looking over the mountains to our left and the 100 mile wilderness when I see this massive shadow of a terrifying mountain and realize “Oh, that’s the mountain I’m climbing.” Katahdin deserves every bit of the hype. Don’t do it with a pack and don’t do it in any kind of bad weather. Climbing Katahdin was doubtlessly the funnest climb on the AT. It starts gradually then turns into a vertical boulder scramble until it reaches the top plateau where it is one more mile to the sign. Seeing that sign threw me off. I've seen pictures nearly every day for months but to actually be there and to actually deserve that summit felt unreal. 1,300 more miles wait for me in the south but this is the end of Maine. This is the end of Part 1. The end of my time with the incredible NoBos that I’ve journeyed with. Gratitude to the trail and the trail community stuck with me on the way down until knee pain drowned it out. I made it ? of the way down the mountain when I got a surprise: my mom! She somehow got a parking space and climbed up the Abol trail and said “Marvel! Come up again with me!” Katahdin is no joke, I’m tired and have no desire to re-climb those boulders I just butt-slid down but there’s no saying no so I climbed that mountain again and don’t regret it. *skips over a few painful hours**gets to a hotel and we both fall asleep at 6:30*The End of Part IP.S. thank you to humanity for being incredible!","

Marvel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548860,"I suppose I need to do another “I haven't died yet” post. So, I haven't died yet! Quite the opposite, I've had an amazing month. Too much is happened over the past 400 miles to write about so I'll just skip to the present. A bit of history: I met up a hiker family! Since day 2 I've been hiking with two Kiwis, Rocky and Ripper, and Flatlander. Close extended trail family members include Jellybean and Cap.Currently, I'm in Shenandoah National Park or just out of it - not sure where the border is. Today the whole tramily hit our personal record with a marathon day. It was 26.2 miles between shelters which was too perfect not to do.Hiking was pretty normal: we just got up earlier and I pack up fast and made it to a viewpoint just in time for the sunrise. A few miles later we came upon the much anticipated campstore! A yogurt and a massive chocolate muffin later we hit the trail.With this crew, I’ve deeply explored something central to my hiking experience: breaks! I love breaks. And we take a lot of them. Honestly, we really didn't have to walk longer or faster we just had to take less breaks. At about mile 26, I felt great. I’d hate to jinx it, but I haven't suffered enough. The AT is always made out to be an immense challenge and I'm not necessarily disagreeing but I've had an amazing time. I still love hiking and I love this life.","Deleware Water Gap
