Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514410,"The plan #1...Is, to start planning which includes saving money, buying gear, moving stuff to Florida (more on that later), and having enough money saved for re-entry. Plan #2...Is to look for better opportunities (Career) and if I can find something that pays well, I like, etc...well, then plan #1 will have to be put on hold. To complicate things further...I have to have all my ducks in a row to start in April. There's no need to start, when I know that I don't have enough cash...Can't crash and burn.So I went over the numbers ie. how much to save from each paycheck, how many overtime days I need, etc...as of now, I'm ahead in overtime days and saving like gazelle crazy (see Dave Ramsey)!I've also started buying gear, which lead to buying a scale... and then turned into starting a spread sheet to keep up with it all.The goal is to complete the trail in 5 months, so I want to go as light as I can within my budget. Sometimes I have a hard time justifying the cost for certain items. I'm trying to get a base weight of all items in my pack to around 11 lbs, not including food, water and fuel. So I'm open to any suggestions!",,The plan,"Sep 26, Sat",0
Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514411,"After talking to my landlord about general stuff (just shoot'in the S%^#). I learned, that he had done (when he was younger) what I would like to do for a career. I asked him if he could critique my resume. Going into it, I thought he's gonna look at my resume and be like WOW! This is great! Don't change a thing!Unfortunately, out came the red pen... and I got a rude awakening. When it was all said and done, my resume looked a thousand times better than when I started. Thanks Tom! You are like the Mr. Miyagi (wax on wax off) I needed for the rough draft.I look at my gear list like he looked at my resume and thought..what can I change to make it lighter, how can I make things more efficient or pull double duty. So I have approx. 6 months to work on the rough draft until it's time to turn in the final paper (so to speak). Researching gear is a long process. So many companies. Then examining the material used in the product and its weight plus its price has taken a long time. Having a digital scale that reads in grams adds to the craziness.Being able to look at things in a different way, has been difficult. For example, I want to carry a knife, but do I really need one? A single edge razor blade, will work. Another would be camping stoves....I have used an MSR Whisperlite for, forever. They are obsolete now. Then I read about cat can stoves that run on denatured alcohol and can boil 2 cups of water in under 5 minutes using less than an ounce of fuel. I cook meals (mac-n-cheese, instant potatoes, etc..) in my Evernew 1.3L Titanium pot. It still seems weird to cook on an alcohol stove.",,Rough draft...,"Sep 26, Sat",0
Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514413,"Desire...How much do you want it/have to have it....
There are 2 examples that come to mind when I think about making it all the way to Mt. Katahdin. 
One being, what I decided to do, to make it to the career I once had. The drive was 10 out of 10, no questions asked. I started at the bottom and worked my way up. Then the drive I had for a second career choice (RN) started out strong but lost its momentum. So I decided to keep a spiral journal (started Mid-August) to record how I feel about the physical/mental challenges I think I will face until the start date. 
Do I still have that ""Desire"" to make it all the way...so far absolutely! Hope I can say the same thing at 1000 miles.",,Desire...,"Sep 26, Sat",0
Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514414,"I'm working on making/purchasing gear. 
Once I have the basics for a weekend trip, I hope to find some cold rainy weather to test my stuff. I'm open for going to North GA. for this but as far as training I feel I'm at a disadvantage because I live on the coast. I suppose I could hike up the Talmadge Memorial Bridge in Savannah or maybe the one in Brunswick.Re-thinking....as I look at the spreadsheet I set up. I can't help to think about stuff that I want to carry but don't need because I can buy it in town, within a few days (for the most part). Things like, nail clippers or do I need 2 bic lighters or would a book of matches in a ziplock work, large first aid kit, etc...",,Testing and re-thinking,"Sep 26, Sat",0
Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/514415,"So I bought my pack from R.E.I. (Thank you Karen for helping me with stolen pack issues!) and quilt from Enlightened Equipment. 
On to the tent....build my own I thought. All I think I need is a bug net and lightweight tarp and alakazam, I'm good. Ordered a military mosquito bar net off of amazon (weighs 2-3 lbs), went to Homedepot (sorry Lowes) and picked up a plastic painters tarp (2 mil) and soldering iron. Learned how to weld plastic for the bathtub floor that weighed 8 ozs. Put my old therm-a-rest in it and laid down...thought ""this rocks""! Until I stretched my shoes across it and ripped holes in the stuff. Went back to Homedepot and got 4 mil. Welded great but was to heavy and ridged. Even bought a cheap sewing machine cause how hard can it be....then I realized that even though, over time, I could master these things. I just needed to spend the money and buy decent gear. 
Certain stuff you can go cheap and other stuff you just can't or shouldn't. Thanks Judy for super fast service! Solong6 it is.",,Research & Development...,"Sep 26, Sat",0
Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515802,"Where are you now Andy Barrows?Well I've gotten most of the bigger pieces of gear and had a chance to talk about the trip with some close friends (Ryan/Courtney). I knew Ryan would be all for this trip but it was cool that Courtney seemed on board as well. She had many questions and was legitimately concerned. I realize, its easier to tell someone your plan when you have all your bases covered. That way, they have less doubt/fear of what you are about to do. The ones who care worry..the ones that don't, do not. Finances...Still on trackThe idea of doing this has given me a goal...I can't explain it but that desire thing is kicking in! I've also been thinking about getting a second job. Overtime is gonna run out at the end of this month.Today was AWESOME!!!Met an AT thru Hiker (1998) at work!!!While driving around work, I noticed a vehicle with an unusual license plate. It had the silhouette of a hiker on it. I approached the driver and asked what the license plate meant with the hiker?He said he hiked the Appalachian trail in 1998 and the continental divide trail (can't remember the date). I was shocked... and told him of my plans. I could tell he was happy. After lunch I went to his office and asked him about the AT. He had pictures of his trips everywhere! I told him I had so many questions that I didn't know where to start!After rambling on about my gear and plans, he agreed that I should go with an alcohol stove, plan less mail drops (he did zero), etc. I asked him if I could talk to him more about the AT and he said come by anytime.It's funny how things change....When I told him of my packs base weight and what he carried are like comparing apples to oranges... He might has well carried cinder blocks in his pack! Hahaha!",,Less than 6 months out...,"Oct 13, Tue",0
Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516735,"Got off work and made reservations for 2 nights at Jekyll Island campground to test out my gear. On the way, I stopped at Walmart and bought a bottle of Heet $1.58, 2 tuna packets @ $2.48, 3 Idahoan potatoes @ $3.00, 1 mac-n-cheese .98, Knorr Teriyaki rice $1.00, chicken stuffing $1.25, Peanut M&M's fun size $2.68 and Hostess Ho Hoes $2.98. Also got trekking poles and 50' paracord. Finally made it at 7:45 pm. I bought a bag of firewood from the campground host and I followed him to my site. Temperature was probably in the 70's. This would be the second time I set up my tent, this time in the dark. It took less than 5 minutes. I only bought the trekking poles because I forgot my modified tent poles that I used before. Wish I had flick-lock poles right know. After that, I lit my cat can stove and waited for the water to boil. I kept hearing a chopping noise from another camp site...then heard a tree fall. WTF...idiots! The water was boiling and I poured it into a zip lock bag (not a real ziplock) filled with mac noodles then put it in the insulating pouch (sunscreen) I made. I over heard my neighbors say they were all most out of wood so I asked if they wanted some. They invited me over. John and Mary were from Pennsylvania. John told me they were retired and have traveled all over the U.S. In one of his stories, he explained that it was better to have independent suspension on your camper when traveling in Alaska because the roads shift (up and down-tundra/permafrost) and those that did not have it would bounce up, tires still spinning, land hard and leave tire marks on the road or a story about a restaurant they went to on Prince Edward Island (above Maine) and had the best lobster dinner. We finished around 11:30. I checked my mac-n-cheese noodles. The bag had a hole in it and the noodles had turned to mush. I saved the cheese packet. Went to sleep around midnight.Sometime during the night my Exped mat lost air, I pumped it back up. got up to pee and tripped over a guy line (need glow in the dark paint?). I managed to re-gain balance and not fall. This is the first time I've used a non-free standing tent and am not used to it. I opened my eyes the next morning and counted 12 mosquito's inches from my face and was also laying flat on the ground. Exped lost air. 7:50 a.m. I crawled out of my tent and swore rigamortis had set in. I looked to my left and there was John with a smile on his face (probably because he slept in his nice camper and I slept on the ground) and offered me a cup of coffee.11:15 R.E.I., Jacksonville, FL. I bought a 2L platypus, 15 liter food bag, shirt and hat.When I got back to the camp site I had to decide whether to walk the big bridge and get Mcdonald's or walk the Island and get Dairy Queen, DQ wins! 2:00 p.m. I packed my tent, clothes, food bag, quilt, sleeping mat, 2L platypus, rain jacket and 20 oz powerade and left by 2:15. For some reason I left my stove, Heet, windscreen and 1.3L pot on the picnic table. Hung a left out of the campground and followed the bike path. Things I noticed... My shoes weight 14.4 oz a piece, wish they were lighter, need to pack my backpack better, shoulder straps are killing me (also need to put frame back in), Platypus bite valve sucks! Need to swap out with Camelback, much better!Finally came to, I guess the half way point. I could turn left and go to the DQ or right and walk over the bridge leading to the island. As I'm walking up the bridge I thought, just make it to the top then you can turn around. Made it down the bridge, turned around and went back up. Went to DQ and ordered a cheeseburger and medium chocolate extreme blizzard. Afterwards I continued toward the campground. The last hour my legs were killing me, don't stop, keep going I told myself. You have 6 beers waiting for you.7:15 made it back to camp store and bought a bag of ice. I asked the girls at the register how many miles it was around the island. They said 22 on the bike path. There's no way I walked 22 miles, must be wrong. Had to be closer to 8-10. Put ice in my cooler and ran into John, he said it was closer to 16. I sat down on the picnic table and was attacked my mosquito's so I walked to the showers. 7:30 Set up tent in the dark again (hope this does not become a habit), pumped up sleeping pad (wishing I had a Z-lite right now) got firewood, and drank cold beer. I made the Idahoan applewood smoked bacon mashed potatoes and added the cheese from last night's failed attempt. This stuff is AWESOME!!!! Went to bed at 10 p.m. phone at 31%During the night, my sleeping pad kept shifting to the left and I would wake up half on half off. I think the silnylon is just slick and will take some time getting used to. Something was crawling on me during the night, spider maybe? Woke up, sleeping pad lasted the whole night. Climbed out of my tent, made some hot chocolate and found some IBprophen in my truck. Phone was dead.I packed up and drove around the island including the bridge, total 10.6 miles. I think I could add another 2 miles but need to get a pedometer to be sure.",,Training day,"Oct 30, Fri",0
Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517714,"This is a test. It's the first time I've used my phone to make an entry. A couple of things to update. I know I said in the beginning that if I found a better job that the hike would be put on hold. Well, I Haven't Looked. I'm to focused on hiking in April. Also was hospitalized for a few days and got ""cleared"" to hike the trail by my doctor.",,Strike 2,"Nov 25, Wed",0
Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519246,"Sorry!!! For some reason this entry failed to load correctly.I've been waiting for the weather to start getting colder in North Georgia so that I could test my gear against the cold weather. My main concern was that my 30 degree quilt and clothes I picked would be warm enough for the first week of April. The predicted temps. today would be in the high 30's - low 40's and mid to high 20's at night. I left Savannah a little after noon and arrived at Amicalola Falls State Park before 5p.m. Drove up to the lodge and reserved a campsite. There was one left. For this trip I brought way more stuff than normal. I screwed together my pocket rocket (Chinese knock off) and noticed that because I paid less that 5 dollars for it. It sprays fuel every time I screw on the canister. The pizo igniter is starting to get loose but once lit works great. While waiting for water to boil I set up my tent and sleeping pad. Since it was going into the 20's I did not need to keep the awning up on my Solong 6 tent. That cool idea I came up with. Using an arrow shaft for the awning pole. Waste of space. A stick I find on the ground will work fine.So I'm in my tent pulling zip lock bags with different stuff out of my pack when I found my Anker 5200 mAh battery charger. When I left, it had 3 blue lights or 75% charge. I think I plugged my phone (9%) into it around 7p.m. (the battery in my cell phone is 1900 mAh) set the charger in an extra wool sock and went to sleep.I'm sleeping in 1 pair of hiking shorts, wind pants, thick camp socks, hiking T-shirt, long sleeve hoodie and down hooded jacket, covered with my 30 degree enlightened equipment quilt.During the night I woke up when part of the quilt wasn't over me or when my arms would slide off my sleeping mat and touch the crushed stone camping pad my tent was set up on. The next day I woke up and was excited to start hiking. I packed up and noticed that my phone was charged to 46%. Either I'm doing something wrong or the cold weather is killing my batteries and I have to insulate them better. Also have no cell service. I use StraightTalk and was hoping that I would be using Verizon towers but no luck. Airplane mode helped but may need to come up with something different.Things I learned...awning pole is not needed during cold weather, need a pee bottle for cold weather, remember to keep hiking socks in warm place for the next morning, buy a charcoal lighter to replace mini bic.Overall, my gear would work for this weather but I decided to get thermal top/bottom for the next night. I packed up, went back to the lodge and asked where the nearest Walmart was for a few extra things before the approach trail. The reservation clerk was very helpful and told me to take a left out of the park and drive 18 miles to Dahlonega.",,Gear test,"Jan 01, Fri",0
Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519343,"I turned left out of the park and drove 18 miles to Dahlonega. I needed gas first so I stopped at a gas station. Think I paid $1.76 per gallon. Drove another mile or so and the Walmart was on the right. There I bought some Hershy bars, kit kat bars, beef jerky, blueberry pop tarts, 4 pack of Guinness, Campbell's chunky chili, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, loaf of french bread and the thermal top and bottoms (long underwear). After getting groceries I went to the travel cup/mug section. I looked one more time at travel mugs because I like having something to drink hot chocolate/coffee, etc. out of. Nothing I wanted, so I left. I kept thinking...need a big styofoam cup and I will be set. Back to the gas station and bought a 32 oz. coke in a styrofoam cup... and a banana nut muffin. Went back to the park. There was a lot of people at the park. I went to the visitor center and asked about leaving my truck in the parking lot and hiking the approach trail. The clerk told me to park at the lodge and start there because she thought I would not make it up the stairs with my pack.I smiled, signed in and took my yellow pass. Walked back to my truck and grabbed my pack.My pack was loaded with probably 6 days of food, 6 oz. denatured alcohol, pocket rocket canister, 2 pints of Guinness and 3 liters of water.I went behind the visitor center and took a picture of the archway and thought it's not time yet to cross under it. So I turned around and looked for the path to the stairs going up to the waterfall.400+ stairs later, I was on top (never doing that again!) and picked up the trail. I started between 1-2 p.m. So far so good, I passed a dozen people hiking. There were 3 people in I'm guessing their early sixties that put their hands up and said, ""it's the hiking bandito, don't rob us!"" as they passed me. I laughed because I had my ball cap on and buff over my face and you could only see my eyes (it was cold!). Got to say, this was the first time I've really used polyester/nylon/wool clothing to keep warm. Mostly used cotton and let me tell you what a difference it makes. Also could not have made it this far without the trekking poles. It's like turning your body into a 4 wheel drive machine. They provide stability, help you power uphill and slow you down when descending, saving your knees.The main reason for this trip was to test for cold weather. If I made it to Springer would be great but I looked at getting there, as a bonus. Which is why with about 30 minutes of sunlight left, I decided to make camp. I remember this spot from a long time ago. There was an opening, fire ring made of rock and 3 big concrete blocks. One had ""First Platoon"" written on it. Pitched my tent, drank the pints of Guinness, then heated the chili and cheese in my pot. Normally I would only boil water in the pot but...I'm testing stuff this weekend. That includes, filtering water with my sawyer mini, using aquamira solution, comparing a cat can stove vs. pocket rocket stove and finally toilet paper vs. baby wipes...That's why I brought the chili. I used the spoon a couple of times then remembered the loaf of bread I was carrying and broke off a few big pieces to dip in the chili and cheddar cheese mixture. Very good on a cold night! Thermals were put on and I called it a night.",,Gear test part II,"Jan 02, Sat",0
Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519350,"Last night was great! I was not cold at all and think the temps got down in the 20's again. As I took off my thick camp socks I remembered that I forgot to throw my hiking socks (darn tough) in the bottom of my quilt. No big deal. Got out of the tent, lowered my food bag from the tree branch (PCT style works great) and packed up. I wasn't hungry and decided to hike on toward Springer. I came to a sign that read ""Hike Inn to the right 3 point something miles and Springer 4.3 miles"". So I kept going. I saw another sign that pointed to the left, ""Water"". About 30 feet downhill was a strong flowing spring. I took off my pack and filled up my smart water bottle. The sawyer mini filtered slow. I still had a liter of water in my platypus so I was good. a short while later a 3 sided shelter appeared around a bend. I think it was black gap shelter. This is the one I stayed at many years ago, because of the mice I vowed never to stay in one again. Yes, I know I will have to stay in them...but at the time.Boiled water using the pocket rocket/canister and made coffee. That 32 oz. styrofoam cup I brought cracked so I had to make some adjustments...It is now a 6 oz. cup. Made some more using the cat can stove and ate the muffin and some beef jerky.My thoughts on both stoves - canister stove is great for convenience. Screw the canister in, turn the valve open and click the pizo igniter and you can turn it all the way open for faster boil times...but if it were to tip over, I don't think I could save whatever I was cooking. It would fall on the ground because it's top heavy. The cat can stove requires you to measure out fuel...I spilled every time. Also if the pot is not level and it falls, I'm able to save it quicker but fuel spills and sets fire to whatever to touches.After breakfast there was a Rumble, Rumble....There is a privy behind the shelter. Yeah baby wipes prevailed here.I decided not to hike on to Springer but to turn back. I had to drive back to Savannah later in the day. I stopped one more time at that spring I passed and filled up my 1 liter bottle and another liter in the platypus. Finally made it back to the parking area above the stairs. I was running out of time and thought I could get back quicker by taking the stairs. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Slowly walked back to my truck and left the park around 5:30 p.m. I stopped at a McDonald's then drove back to Savannah. Made it home at Midnight. Woke up 4 1/2 hours later, took some tylenol then had to go to work...",,Gear test part III,"Jan 03, Sun",0
Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525380,"Hello Everyone!To bring everyone up to speed...Some things I want to talk about since my last entry.  My gear list is complete and I feel good about everything I've selected. My goal was to have my pack weigh roughly 11 lbs. but it is actually between 13 - 14 lbs. and I'm happy with it. My plan is to start out heavier the first 2 weeks, so that I can really figure out what exactly I need, etc.My thoughts on gear...for people that are going to attempt this on a limited budget. Tips on saving money when buying gear.I bought my backpack over Labor Day weekend 2015. I wanted a pack from ULA but went with one from the REI Outlet store. I used a 20% coupon and got free shipping on my backpack that cost around $76 compared to the ULA pack at $235. If you know the size you need for all of your stuff and are good/clever at packing, you will be ahead of the game. Also consider the timing on when you buy stuff and when stuff goes on sale.
I think the price on my pack has only dropped $10 as of 3/29/16.. REI's next big sale was in November around the 14th up to cyber monday 2015.Tents...drove me literally insane. I'm 6'4"" 220lbs. Trying to find one was tough because I'm tall. My lightheart Gear Solong 6 was the perfect choice. I'm happy with my quilt from Enlightened equipment. Finding deals on tents and sleeping bags were more challenging because these items are more custom made.When a deal really isn't a deal.REI... I really like this company but...even though they give you 20% coupons towards 1 item, I found that Walmart can beat some of their prices (sawyer squeeze, aqua mira) without a coupon and if you live near a Super Walmart you can go and pick up your items and not have to wait for REI to ship it to you. Practice using an alcohol stove and you can save a ton of money. I think I paid 40 cents for my stove. Clothing...Learn about wool, nylon, polyester, etc. You can find non-name brand items for a lot less. OK...moving onI gave my 30 day notice to my landlord on March 1st...March 31st is my last day in my apartment.I gave my 2 week notice to my boss on March 21st (Monday) and my final day will be April 1st (Friday). I told him my plan because I'm super excited about this trip/life dream. It was a shock to a lot of my co-workers. Training - Month and a half, walking the parking garages at work. 4 hours per day...3 days a week.Just got back from moving 3/4's of my stuff to Tampa, FL. Sunday evening. Started a relationship....Yes, I know the timing is horrible. I told her my plans from the start. Wanted to be honest. Hope she stays....and moves to Florida with me after I make it to Maine...hahahaha, Hi baby!I will update once more Friday, April 1st. I get off work at 2:30 PMAfter that I will be driving to Tampa,FL. to finish storing my stuff...Hang out with my cousin Saturday and Flying to Atlanta early Sunday morning. Mom's gonna pick me up and drive me to Amicalola Falls State Park, where I will stay over night and hike to Springer Mtn., Monday morning, April 4th.I've been getting a lot of questions about-are you carrying a gun-are you going alone-how are you able to do this-why are you doing this-etc......If you want more specific answers, send me an email at abarrows31419@gmail.com and I will try to answer any questions and don't forget to sign my guest book!Andy",,T Minus.....and counting.,"Mar 30, Wed",0
Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526386,"Today is monday morning April 4th. I just had the AYCE breakfast at the lodge. It was great. I'm in my room now just packing up a few things before i go to the visitor center. Just want to go back over the past couple days. I said I was going to update the journal Friday but wasn't able to but here's what happened... so I turn my stuff in it work. That was a great feeling. On the road heading towards tampa florida to drop off more stuff that I had in my apartment and store my truck.   After unloading   I went to see my cousin and went to a sports bar to have a couple beers and talk after that I went to the storage facility for my truck and filled out the paperwork. Then went to Walmart for a couple things. When I returned to store my truck the gate code did not work I called the owner and he came to help. I called yellow cab and got a ride to the airport.The flight (Delta ($72) took about am hour amd ten minutes. My mother picked me up and we went to IHOP for breakfast. As we were eating a woman came in and I told my mom I bet she's hiking the A.T. after we ate I asked her.Tara was wain on a friend and then would be section hiking from. Springer to I believe the NOC. We left the airport and went to Walmart for resupply. Then we picked up Tom (step dad) and they drove me to amicalola falls state park lodge. I checked in and we said our good byes. I relaxed a while. Watched the season finale of the walking dead. 1 am. ...I can't sleep...I took the 2 last beers (thanks Tom) and went out on the lodges balcony. After I finished the last one I went back to my room and went to sleep.It's 11.45 am and I'm heading to Springer Mountain.
I started late...1:30 p.m., walked over to the visitor center and signed in. I was number 1278. Then I walked to the back of the building and set my pack on a plastic folding table. Jay and Tom (A.T. volunteers) were there offering ways to reduce weight in your pack. I also met Michelle. She was there because she always wanted to hike the Appalachian trail but scared to do it because she's a female. I told her there are plenty of women who hike the trail. I was inspired by Yogi (female) who hiked the A.T., C.D.T & P.C.T. I hope she follows her dreams.
I finally walked under the archway and began my journey. It took me almost an hour to walk back up the stairs.
After crossing the first creek I met Alex. He carried a goat skull on the back of his pack. We hiked a while but he was faster and went on ahead. A couple of miles later I hiked with a guy from Brazil named Mark. We hiked to black gap shelter. After setting up our tents, I got out my cat can stove and heet (denatured alcohol). The ground looked a little uneven so I used my pot to level the stove out. CRUNCH....to much pressure and I collapsed it. I was still able to use it but it doesnt work as well. After dinner Mark called it a night. I still had a few more things to do when I looked up and saw a light coming up the trail. A hiker walked up to me and asked where the water source was. I'm 6'4"" and he towered over me....
He introduced himself as Giant...
I took him to the where the sign for water was, went back to my tent, got under my quilt and fell asleep.","Amicalola Falls State Park Lodge

I crossed a small bridge and few minutes later ran to Mark Sweeper an A.T. thru hiker (2012?). After talking to him while I continued on and finally made it to hawk mountain shelter. There are around 20 -24 people here. After finding a spot to setup my tent, I made some spanish rice burritos. A couple of us gathered some wood and made a fire. The people there were alex, Johnno, Treck, Jacob and a man from canada. Johnno had some bourbon and pasted it around. I think I went to bed around 10 pm.","Black gap shelter

Alexs trailname is now mountain goat. He and I are the last ones here from yesterday. I think he is still packing in the shelter. It is 11:55 am. I'm about to leave in 10 minutes and am going to Gooch mountain shelter.Usually I like to camp by 6 pm. I didn't make it to Gooch but stayed at Justice creek. This place is great. I crossed the creek and saw what looked like Mark's blue and white food bad hanging off a tree branch on the other side of the creek. I turned left after crossing the creek and walked maybe 30 yards. There was a log bench and some fire wood where I decided to camp. I camped on a flat spot and the stream was maybe 40 feet away from where I am. I walked down to the stream and found a study branch to hang my food bag then filled my 2 liter bladder,1 liter water bottle and 2 cups of water in my pot. When I got back to my camp site I made some macaroni and cheese with tuna fish. After dinner, I rinsed out my pot and got ready to go to sleep.

The shelter is on side of a hill. When I walked to it, I saw a hiker drying out his gear. He said there were a lot of people there last night. Probably those from hawk mountain shelter.

Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529281,"Woke up around 8 am. Today's mission is to get over Blood Mountain and into Neel's gap (mountain crossings). The morning started very slow, I didn't get much sleep. Sleeping on an incline was not smart but I didn't have much choice. I moved everything out of my tent and over to a big log on flat ground. I packed up. I'm getting more comfortable with the amount of water I carry. So usually I top of my 2 liter platypus and fill up the 1 liter bottle with my sawyer mini attached. 
On the way up I met John and his wife Jodie . John thru hiked in 2012 I think. John gave a lot of great tips and I was able to keep up with them for a while. When I finally made it up to the rock shelter, I was greeted by ""Hi Andy"". I looked up and they were on top of the huge boulder overlooking the shelter.We talked for a little while and then they headed back the way we came. Jodie said it would take them about 4 hours (woody gap?). After they left I met Digs deep from New Orleans and Bugsy (sp). On the way down the mountain I overheard Digs deep talking about this amazing hot dog recipe that she makes for her family to Bugsy. I wanted to eat 10 of them. 
A hiker with a guitar in his pack walked by me. I asked if on his way up he could pass on a message to 2 ladies walking down. Tell them Andy is buying pizza when they make it down to mountain crossings. I wanted to pass the good vibes on because without John and Jodie, I would still be hiking to the top of Blood mountain. 
I was walking down the trail when I could see the top of the hostel...As I crossed the road all I could do was smile. Neel's gap was my first mental way point and I made it. I put my pack on the picnic table and waited for Digs deep (50's ?) and Bugsy ( 60's ?). When they arrived I asked what they wanted and got 2 red baron pizzas and 3 cokes. The guys inside (mountain crossings employees) said it would take about 15 minutes for the pizzas to cook. I went back outside to the picnic table. 
There were talks of the weather turning bad for the next 2 days... high 20's tonight. When I went back into get the pizzas I asked how many spots were left in the hostel. The guy at the counter said, 1 left...
One of the employees helped me bring the pizzas and cokes to the picnic table. As I walked by hungry hikers I felt as if i may need.an armed escort...The pizzas were great. I met another hiker named Chris. She is a tattoo artist from Illinois (?)","A few miles short of Sassafras Gap Shelter

I think its around 8 a.m. once again Iset my tent up on a slight incline and spent the night surfing to the bottom of my tent. I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. I finally got out of my tent and made some hot chocolate. Then looked around and saw Nemo and another hiker. It was Brooklyn. We talked about getting to New York for some pizza. Nemo told us that New Haven, CT. is the place to go. They packed up and stated hiking. I could have sworn they were arguing about who has the best pizza as they walked down the trail above me.  I finally made it to Winding Stair Gap. A woman asked me if I wanted some ham. I said yes. She looked at her daughter (9-10) and asked her to get a bag. The little girl came back with a sandwich bag full of spiral cut ham. I told them my name was Andy and then asked them their names. Tony and Tana were locals, they came to Winding Stair Gap to help us out. Tony said he wanted to wait another 15 minutes to see if there are any more hikers that needed a ride into town. We waited a while and then we got in the back of his truck. He drove us into town to the Budget Inn. Tony and Tara said if they didn't have any rooms left they would take us wherever we wanted to go. Also if we needed a ride back to Winding Stair Gap Tony would do it on his lunch break at 1- 1:30. I checked in to room 18 at the Budget Inn and walked back to his truck and said thank you for the ride. These are truly, great people!I looked at my guidebook inside where the grocery store was laundromat and a couple other things I started to walk down the road and passed the Hot Spot gas station and further down the road there was a McDonald's. I got some lunch and then walked back. As I was walking back, I noticed this kid was putting up an ice cream sign. There was a ice cream stand like you would see at a fair the ones that you could hook to a big truck I bought an ice cream cone and told the girl at the counter that if she wanted to make more money to put their ice cream cart at Winding Stair Gap. I think they would do pretty well.  I'm walking back with a chocolate ice cream cone in one hand in a medium sized McDonald's drink in the other. Back at the budget I ran into Ranger and Bogeye. They were sitting outside of room 10. I went back to my room cleaned up a little and then walk to the lazy hiker Brewery. I ran into Heather and Dan and spoke to Dan awhile about Healthcare systems and other things. Also spoke to Heather and she talked about traveling and where they have been. As I was looking around I saw Jake, he waved at me and came over and we talked a little while I told him when I got into town and he told me where he was staying at.  6 p.m. The Lazy hiker was closing... Dan, Heather and Dave decided to go to Mulligans to watch the hockey game. Detroit Red Wings vs. Tampa Bay Lightning. I met them at Mulligans and it was a great night. I saw this giant hamburger that Orange Crush was eating and decided I wanted one. It was called the double play. 2 half pound beef patties. It's like a Big Mac on steroids I finished my hamburger and fries and had one of their local beers I think it was called Dirty Girl Ale.

When I got to the post office I ran into Dave who I met at Mulligan's with Heather and Dan (Orange Crush) he was sending a bounce box to Fontana Dam Lodge. I was next in line and the clerk called me up. I gave her my package and asked if Tony was around, she said yes he's in the back let me get him. I moved over and waited when she came back she said she wasn't able to find him. Both the clerks laughed because they couldn't belive he was helping us so much. I told them to tell him I said hello and thanks again. I left the post office and walked back to the laundromat where I had to put my clothes in the dryer. I walked back to the office. It was 10:45 there was no way I was going to be able to pack everything in 15 minutes to get on the next shuttle back to Winding Stair Gap. So I made the decision to stay another day I'm happy with the decision even though it was costly, but I'm glad I stayed. I walked back to the ATM at Wells fargo and got out another 40 dollars, the walk wasn't that bad. I paid for another day. Then I walked back to the laundry mat to check on my clothe. Once my clothes were dry, I threw them in a stuff sack and walked back to the Budget Inn. As I was getting closer to my room (number 18), I noticed this guy with his hat, sunglasses and camo shorts...  It was Mickey...  I was so happy to see him. I walked over and said hello. A short while later and Dawn (Mrs. Massachusetts) came out of the room and she gave me a big hug. I was so happy to see those two, because they are part of my trail family. After that I spent most of the day relaxing. I finished most of the Noonday IPA beers (6pack) that I bought. Later n the evening, there was a small gathering outside of room 10 everybody was having a good time and just talking about different things. Boogey, Ranger, Mickey and myself were there. A man asked me about my shirt (the Swig & Swine shirt) I told him the story and he laughed and thought it was pretty good. He looked familiar so I asked him his name he said I'm Jack Tarlin AKA Baltimore Jack. 
He is a well known person on the A.T.
I smiled because I told him I had read many Forum posts about him and was happy to meet him.

Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528674,"To all that have been following. 
Sorry for the long gap. I'm spending this morning trying to catch up.
I woke up at 7:30 and am packing up. Waiting on my 11 am shuttle back to Winding Stair Gap. I really liked Franklin. It's one of those small towns tucked away in the mountains. It is 8:57 and I'm try to catch up on the rest of my entries.
It's 10:22...these enties are taking longer than I thought. I have to start packing in order to catch my shuttle.
It's 10:50... I'm all packed up and waiting to leave until I remembered the shampoo and body wash that I wanted to put back in the hiker box. After I did that, I also remembered the 2 bud lights left in the refrigerator. I quickly grabbed them and walked back to the office to see if any in coming hikers wanted them. You should have seen the look on this couples face when I offered them the beers. Glad they didn't go to waste.
Shortly after, I got in the shuttle and we left at 11. Ron Haven is the owner of the motel and also our shuttle driver. He told us that he had to pick up someone near the hostel and also drop somebody off at Ingles. After we did that we were heading to Winding Stair Gap. It took us about 45 minutes total from the motel but the time pasted quick. Ron thanked us for staying at his placeand doing business in the town he lived. I liked him, cool guy. After he dropped the 7 or 8 off us off, I started organizing my pack a little more. I was the last one to cross the road and enter the woods.
The first part of the trail had a few small streams to walk over. As I continued, I caught up to Birdie. We talked about maybe doing 5 or 6 miles and staying at Silyan Bald Shelter. I past Birdie and made it to the shelter sign. I ate some lunch then pulled out the guide book. It said half a mile over steep terrain to the shelter. Just as I was putting back the book, Birdie comes walking by. I told him about the shelter. We both turned around. I pasted him again and a while later the trail cut through a grassy area. I wonder if this is what Baltimore Jack was talking about I thought.
I waited for Birdie to catch up then told him I think this is the place. I also remembered this place from other youtube videos I've watched. Both of us climbed to the top. When I got there I yelled back to him that it was totally worth it! Here you can see a 360 degree view of the mountains, valleys, etc. We took video and pictures. It was amazing! After Birdie ate his corn tortilla and buffalo something tuna, we walked back to our packs.
I think it was around 3:30. We both agree to make it to mile 118 and started walking. Birdie stayed ahead of me the whole way. We had .7 miles left and finally made it to the camping site. Dan (another thru hiker) is also here. We both set up our tents, made some dinner and gathered firewood. I made mac n cheese smothered in Idahoan loaded instant potatoes topped with tuna. I waited forIt was great! After I ate, I cleaned my pot and asked Birdie what time he planned on heading out. He said 9 am. Works for me. I climbed into my tent, finished writing today's journal entry and went to sleep.","Winding Stair Gap

I started my morning routine with hot chocolate. Birdie was up organizing his stuff. After my peanut butter and tortilla breakfast, I started packing up. The goal today is to make it to Wessser Bald Shelter at mile 131.4. I wanted to get as close as I can to the peak, just before the Nantahala Outdoor Center because the climb down is steep and the climb out is even steeper. 
Other thru hikers who have already done this say this is where people drop out. 
The day started out ok. We made it to Wayah Bald Shelter. I found a bisquit and gravy package someone left. I also saw a tree that was drawn on the shelter wall. The artist signed Lando. Lando is a friend from college.
After that we hiked on to Cold Creek Shelter. I told Birdie about if I make it to Maine and then Florida, I wanted to learn how to sail. When we arrived at Cold Creek Shelter, there was a hiker there. I can't remember his name but he told us that he just returned to the United States after living on a 30' sailboat in South America for 6 years and then basically donated his boat to the country of Panama because he didn't have the money for upkeep and cross through the canal.
At the shelter I made some Mac n Cheese & tuna and then continued on.

I turned to my right and saw the trail 8' below. I got on my belly and slid down. There were some steep sections but eventually the trail mellowed out and was easy to walk on.
We made it to Rufus (sp) shelter and took a break. I looked at my guidebook. Only a mile to go.
As we walked the final 50 yards or so the general stores roof appeared out of the woods.
I felt the same way when I saw the roof of the hostel at mountain crossings. I just started to smile and thought...we f*#^ing made it! This spot was another mental check point for me in this long journey. 
Birdie crossed the bridge and found some of the people who stayed in Franklin N.C. I crossed over and soaked my feet in the river. Feel good, Sun dog, Holy diver, Gypsy, Hula bear, Tracey, Brooklyn, Ranger are here to. 
We hung out and then a few of us went to the restaurant. Chicken little also joined us. After we ate, we heard there was a spot to camp at down from the railroad tracks. I stopped at the general store first and bought 4 Cokes and 2 Mr. Pibs. I've been carrying a pint of Jim Beam I bought in Franklin and thought I would split it with the group. Are spot was right on the river. I set up my tent and gathered some fire wood. We got a fire going... and then came the rain. I went back to my tent.

I stayed at Fontana Dam Lodge yesterday it was great. When I got here that morning I walked maybe half a mile down to Fontana Road 28th and then turn right and went to the marina. There was a man there by the name of Carl. He was picking up trash and opened up the store it's a really nice Marina they've got a lot of things and they also have boat rentals and boat slips that they Reserve it's around $1,600 a year for a slip rental inside the marina and I think it's $1900 for a mooring ball out in the lake. Carl gave me a ride on the golf cart back to shore and dropped me off where the shuttle would pick me up. The shuttle came about 15 minutes later and the driver took me to the lodge.
The lodge is really nice, in a way it reminds me of a smaller version of Amicalola Falls Lodge but this one has outside rooms and a pool. I think there are also more cabins that they rent compared to Amicalola. Also there is a laundromat, post office, ice cream store and General Store not too far away and it's within walking distance. Birdie is there right now with some other friends doing laundry. 
Today's goal is to get a few miles into the Smoky Mountains and find a camping spit before it rains I'm looking at the sky right now and it doesn't look too good. There is rain forecasted in 2 days. I'm going to see if I can find a poncho before I leave the lodge.

During that time I saw my girlfriend and fixed her car from the accident she was in. She's ok... She was hit in the passenger side rear. I replaced the drum brake and knuckle assembly. Also the top tie rod, bled the brake and put everything back together.  Saturday I left and my friend from Charleston invited me to stay. I had to go towards Charleston anyway, so I did. He said on tuesday he had to take some clients out fishing and had 1 spot open so I decided to stay the extra days. The boat is called Wadamacallit, it's a 60 foot sportfishing yacht. We caught 18 dolphin (mahi mahi) and 1 sailfish. One of the clients son was throwing up after we left the marina and during the day. I really felt sorry for him. He was 15 or 16. That was the roughest sea I have ever been in. The captain said hold on multiple times. The boat was constantly rocking up and down, side to side. I think everybody was happy to get back to land. The captain and 1st mate cleaned the fish and everything was split between the 6 of us. After we got home, Ryan vacuum sealed all of the fish and put them in his deep freezer.

We stopped at crystals and got a large box of them ( 24 pack?). Then picked up his boss Richard and drove to Snowbird mountain. I told him thanks for everything and got back on a trail by noon.

It SUCKED!!!   Add to that the drops of water running down the roof on the inside and then dropping. Everyone keeps telling me it's condensation. All I know is... that was the day I cussed the most on the trail! I was so angry! Mark (Lightheart rep) was very helpful and give me some options. He recommended silicone sealant from rei or I could pick up some flowable silicone windshield sealant from Advanced Auto. I think it helped but the condensation is something I'm going to have to get used to. I'm going to call Mark friday when I get to Hot Springs North Carolina.April 19th Part 2It is 855.

So I made it to Hot Springs NC. I loved that town! Its such a great feeling when you can start to see the tops of roofs to structures (houses, businesses, etc.) You know your almost there! Hot Springs has a great diner, B & B's and local bars, ice cream stores and places to get coffee. When I got into town I ate lunch then headed to Elmer's Sunnyside Inn. It's a mansion converted into a bed & breakfast. He also makes breakfast(vegan)if you want for an additional fee. Let me pause for a minute and go back to tell about the people I started hiking with. This will makes sense at the end because one of these hikers is at Elmer's also. Someone I haven't seen in over a month and a half.When I started April 4th I walked the approach trail and met a guy by the name Mountain goat. He got that name because he was carrying a goat skull on the back of his pack. Remember he hiked on and I didn't see him again until Hawk Mountain shelter. That's 2 shelters past Springer mountain I believe. While at that Shelter I also met and became friend's with two other guys, Feel Good and Trek the Savage Rabbi (yes, he's a real Rabbi)but we call him Trek. Trek started back in November/December in the Florida Keys.A few days later I'm at Neel's gap hostel with Chris (tattoo artist), Jake the fake (who is now ""The Dude""), Giant, Smoke and ATK. Giant got us a cabin at the Blood Mountain cabins. After a week or so later, everyone started hiking different paces and I haven't seen them...Until...I check in at Elmer's, he tells me my room is up stairs and when I reach the top of the stairs, a woman says hello to me. I responded hello back and then looked at her...It was Chris. She to had got a room at Elmer's. I gave her a big hug because out here, these people become your trail family/brother's/sister's/team mates. We caught up on the time we hadn't seen our fellow hikers. I told her I had got back from Savannah after seeing/helping my girlfriend. It was great! So her and I decided to get some beers and talk about hiking the A.T. ect. She got some cups from the dollar general and I ran back to the hostel to put the remaining beers in the refrigerator (at Elmer's). As I'm walking back, I see another hiker talking to Chris...It's Mountain goat! He left the trail for 10 days a while back to see his girlfriend. I was so happy!We all talked a while and then checked out the town. I left Hot Springs and headed to Erwin, TN. As I came out of the woods and walked to a road I turned left and didn't really know where I was going to stay/eat at. There was a place on the corner. I saw Kayaks and then a outside covered patio. All of a sudden I hear ""Andy!!!!!"" I look closer and see another group of friend's/hikers. It's Shatterproof, Big beard, little beard and counsilor (that's how he spells it). The beard brothers are fraternal twins. The place is called Uncle Johhny's. It's a hostel that offers kayak rentals, shuttles, tent camping and inside bunks. Trek and Feel good are also there. As well as Waterfall, Tuck and Sunshine. I had a great time there to!Next was Kincora hostel (Bob People's). He is an amazing man that has over 14,000 trail miles/trail maintenance. He's never completed the Appalachian Trail but has hiked a lot in Europe. I had another serendipity moment at his place. The first was finding Birdie's food bag rope and a basket for my trekking pole right next to my tent one morning. The second was learning Bob People's address. When I signed in at the visitor center at Amicalola Falls state park, my number was 1278. That's his street number....A few days later I walked to the town of Damascus, VA. and stayed at the woodchuck hostel. As I'm talking to Chuck (I think/hostel owner)Clarity and her son, Exterminator fly out the door. I had met them at Fontana Dam and we hiked with Birdie and Truckin. I've hiked with Birdie after we met in Franklin, TN.Birdie is also from Savannah and loves to golf!Trek, Autman, Stryder, Waterfall and Tuck were also in town. Shatterproof, counsilor and the beard brothers hiked in a day or two later. This trip has been great! It's also changed me in certain ways. You learn out here that it's not all about making miles and summiting Katahdin (end of the trail). It's about the people you meet, the places you go, experiences you have with others. I'm in Damascus right now...mile maker 468 approx...and thinking about how I'm going to finish the trail by September 15th. If you do the math, it's something like 18.8 miles per day without any zero's (zero mile days = no hiking days). I know I can't do that consistently. So I thought about a flip flop. I drive to Baxter State Park, climb Mt. Katahdin then hike south until September 15th. Then I go home....I've looked at the cost for a rental car, Amtrak, greyhound bus, mega bus and Cyr bus lines and it's out of my budget at the moment. I would have to pay $40-$50 for a shuttle from here to where anyone of these places are.So...I've decided to keep hiking north until I can get to a larger city.I'm leaving Damascus today.Oh...and last night I got my trail name. It is spelled Whojo, pronounced Who joe. I have to thank Shatterproof, Little Beard and Bonnie. We all laughed for hours just saying it!I'm heading to Marion, VA next!Also got a years worth of xarelto for free and am now hiking in a compression sock on my left ankle.And one last thing...I'm willing to trade post cards for cookies if anyone's interested!","

I know that I said I decided to continue North but the next day decided to do the flip-flop and catch a Grey Hound bus out of Marion VA. I paid Bonnie (owner of the Broken Fiddle) to shuttle me to the Econo-lodge in Marion VA. Sota also went with us because he needed a few things from Wal-mart. After shopping we said our good byes and they drove back to Damascus. I walked to the Econo-lodge and split the cost of a room with Little Beard. Little Beard was there because of a knee injury and went ahead of his brother (Big Beard), cousilor and The Girl. The next morning Little Beard walked me to the bus stop. I felt bad for him because I knew his knee was hurting. As we waited, we talked about life after the trail and just random stuff. As the bus pulled up, I began to get excited because #1 this was my first time on a bus and #2 I was going to Maine! I loaded my backpack minus the brain and trekking poles under the bus. Gave the diver my ticket, and looked for a seat. The bus was packed....at first I didn't see any seats. The seats that were available, next to people were filled with their luggage or they were sitting across both seats. At that moment I felt like I was back in the real world.If this bus were full of A.T. hikers I firmly believe that it would have been easy to find a seat. A few minutes later I found a seat. Now as you know I'm tall (6'4"") My knees were jammed in the seat in front of me the the whole ride up. People arguing on their cell phones, babies crying...I'm re-thinking that If I ever do this again....Yeah..should have paid a little extra for the rental car. I left at 11 a.m. Monday June 20th and arrived Late Tuesday night June 21st at 10 p.m. (I think) I also remember stopping in Boston for 5 hours (lay over) before catching the final bus. I went to China town and had lunch.The bus dropped me off at a truck stop about 3 miles from the nearest motel. I had thought about walking the road but it's used heavily by large trucks so I called a taxi instead. The ride cost 10 bucks and I went to the Super 8. The next morning I wanted to explore town. So I asked the clerk at the front desk what's to do in Bangor. She told me that Journey was playing tonight and that If I didn't want to buy a ticket that I could have dinner at the restaurant (High Tide) across the river and listen to the music. Also Stephen King's house is in town. I said thanks and walked to Dunkin Doughnuts for some coffee. Afterwards I went to Mclaughlin seafood for a lobster roll (never had one). I'm glad I tried one but a lobster roll is basically lobster meat in a hotdog bun for $15-$16. From there I checked out Stephen King's house (a silver Mercedes with Florida plates was parked in the drive way) then made my way to Walmart for a no-see-um face net. Now during this time I'm breaking in my new Oboz hiking shoes with green super feet insoles.Side story- My feet were killing me the last 30 miles into Damascus. Shatterproof (also staying at the Broken Fiddle) and I went into town to get a few things. I went the day before to look at shoes but didn't want any of the brands they offered. The guy behind the counter says can I just look at your feet and maybe I could help you. I say ok, remembering he was the same sales clerk I walked out on the day before. I didn't know him at the time but was sitting next to Sota as he tried on shoes. Anyway the clerk helps me out and measures out a pair of super feet. I will never forget when he asked how much #ussy was in me because he said these are going to hurt for the next couple of days but they will make you walk correctly. Just like magic, I was healed and could walk comfortably. My feet had widened just like everyone says they will while hiking. Inov8 290's were awesome until the right toe of my right foot rubbed a hole in the side and the left toes of my left foot were being crushed into the foot bed every time I stepped. Shatterproof and I left and walked to the taco place right around the corner. I didn't want to buy anything yet because I was hungry. While there the clerk also has lunch and sits with us. turns out he wasn't a clerk but the store owner. Jeff gave me what I felt was a deal on the shoes and insoles. Back to Bangor.So as I'm crossing the road going to Wal-marts parking lot I pass a homeless guy holding a sign asking for money. We say hello to each other as I walk by. In the store I buy a few things including the no-see-um netting. They have a ton of these things and they only cost $1.50. As I'm walking out of the store it started to pour so I looked for a place to charge my phone. When this lady asks me if I'm homeless. I pause for a minute and tell her, well technically I am, but am on my way to Baxter State park to hike southbound on the Appalachian Trail. I realize that with long hair,a scraggly beard and a backpack and being way of trail, looks can be deceiving. She is in a wheelchair and tells me how people treat her bad because of her disability. A few minutes later the guy with the sign shows up and is waiting for the bus. Both of them tell me about the bus routes here in Bangor and how much it costs. The guy with the sign even gives me one of his tickets. To help him out I gave him some change that I didn't want to carry anymore.I had the bus drop me of at the stop near the Walgreens and stayed at a cheap motel (not in price but quality). I went to High Tides for dinner and talked to some locals, it was great! The music was loud enough to be heard across the river. People actually brought chairs and blankets to sit on near the bike path. The next morning I walked to the cyr bus station and for something like $12 got a ticket to Medway. Since there were not a lot of people going to Medway, seating was a lot better. The last stop was at a gas station were I got picked up at. I paid the Appalachian trail lodge for the southbound special. They pick you up, you stay 1 night, then they shuttle you to Baxter State park.The woman that picked me up was great. We talked about my trip, she told me about the area, the hostel. It wasn't until I told her about hiking through the smokey's that she told me mentally, I was done. I think I knew it to, just wasn't ready to go home yet.She showed me to the bunk house, told me what time the shuttle leaves in the morning and where to get my lobster dinner. I wasn't leaving Maine without trying a whole lobster. I've had lobster tails and a lobster roll before but this was on my list, eating a whole lobster in Maine.The shuttle left bright and early. I think his name was chief. Very cool guy. He dropped me off at the Katahdin campground. We shook hands and he wished me luck. Baxter State Park is about conservation/protection for good reason. This place is like holy ground to me. It's very different, not because I'm 1700 miles further north but because for the past 18 years I've had the idea of coming here, climbing this mountain and getting my picture taken with that sign. The famous sign that sits on top of Mt. Katahdin. Stealth camping is not allowed, so luckily there was another hiker that just happened to be there and was willing to split his site with me. The Park Ranger made sure I paid him and knew where the site was.Kevin was section hiking and just arrived at the ranger station when I met him. He started in Monson and did the 100 mile wilderness. We both started around 8:30 I think and he took off immediately. I wanted to go slower and take it all in. The climb to me, well...first you start off not to hard. There this amazing waterfall it's great...I passed a few people that said they could not go on any further. Why is this I wondered...Then I met a man (mid 50's)that told me he could not go on any further because off the rebar and 60 mile an hour winds being reported at the top. What?!? I'm afraid of heights but told myself you have to do this...there is no going back. I climbed the first rebar...not to bad I though and kept going. From here there are places that water was running down the trail and I was rock (small) hoping. Then I come to the next section....Huge boulders and it just keeps going up. To be honest, I was terrified. There were places that I thought I would fall from If I slipped. There were times that I thought...I'm stuck and can't make it over this...what am I going to do?!? Options I told myself. You always have options, you just have to look hard to find them sometimes. I make it to the tablelands and am relieved. It's way flatter. Kevin had already climbed Katahdin and passed me going back. After a while you can start to see people at the very top. Then the final climb. There were about 30 people up there. A man offered to take my picture next to the sign. Afterwards I sat and looked around. I stayed up there for nearly 45 minutes. Now the hard part...going down. I didn't realize but my feet, knees and legs were feeling sore. When I finally got back it was dark. The Park Ranger offered to drive me to the camp site. Once there Kevin says, ""What took you so long, what happened""? I explained that due to my fear of heights it slowed me down a lot. We laughed and I went to set up my tent. I was sore and the ground is packed gravel. Meaning I can't put my tent stakes into the ground. I made do with some rocks I found. After my tent was up I sat by the fire Kevin had going. We talked a bit before I went to sleep. The next morning Kevin was packing up and said his girlfriend was picking him up in Millinocket. He was gonna hitch a ride out of the park. So was I but later. all packed up I took a bunch of pictures and headed out of the park towards the entrance. I was able to hitch a ride to the front gate, from there it was road hiking back to town. A couple picked me up and dropped me off at the grocery store. I got a few things then walked to the house of pizza (staff was great but the pizzas are small!!!) They recommended the Katahdin Inn. Great place! Really liked the indoor pool. I needed a few more days of food so as I'm leaving to go to the family dollar I see Kevin sitting on a parking block drinking coffee. We were both surprised because he didn't tell me where he was staying. He offered to take me back to Katahdin camp ground the next day. How awesome is that!His plan was to hike around Baxter state park with his girlfriend before going home. I started hiking south and we actually ran into each other a few times near a lake. They told me about this library in the woods that I should check out, I did. Behind the library is a dock that has an amazing view of a lake and mountain (Katahdin?) I hiked out of the park to Abol Bridge Campground. At this point I'm beat. I was very tired and sore. Picked up a six pack of budweiser and walked to my tent site. After setting up my tent I started a campfire. The campers next to me came over and introduced themselves. I can't remember their names right now but I'm sure I have them in my note book. The taller woman was section hiking and bought and sold college books for a living. She also explain that she house sits and hasn't paid rent in quite a while. The other woman was shorter 5'? and told me that her kids were grown and she finally had free time. The last was a man in his early 30's. I wanted to give him so much advise because he was about to go into the 100 mile wilderness with a canvas army backpack, rambo sized knife, etc but didn't. Hike your own hike I thought and hated when people did that to me. They left early. I was not in a rush because I was still sore and concerned that I didn't have enough food.Kevin said he brought 10 days of food and it took him 9 days to make it through. I on the other hand, had 6 maybe 7 days. I went anyway and hiked to the first shelter. There were a bunch of college kids there and also the guy with the canvas army backpack. He was whittling a branch for the fire. I asked if I could help. He said sure so I removed the green sticks and found some dry twigs. After the fire was going I said that the smaller/drier the sticks are the easier it is to get a fire going. It's funny but in that moment I felt that he appreciated me showing him how to get a fire started. That evening was rough for me. I talked to Ryan (friend from home) when I was at the Appalachian trail lodge and told him that I was thinking about ending my trip. I really missed my girlfriend and had spent way to much money up to this point. He said to think about it and to hike on. The next morning I made the decision to go back.

Whojo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546741,"If anyone were to ask me about the trail, I would say this based on Springer to Damascus and Mt. Katahdin to the first shelter in the 100 mile wilderness.Gear-Backpack I should have bought a larger pack. Mine was to small. I made do but could have been a lot more comfortable. Also using the loading straps more to get that custom fit.The R.E.I flash 45 barely fit all my stuff. Birdie (Hiking friend) was always waiting for the strap to bust or the seams to pop. They never did but I would get a larger pack if I were to do this again.Shoes:I really liked the Inov-8 race ultra 290's at first but when my feet started to swell/widen they made walking painful. I believe that if I had bought a 1/2 size larger and wider shoe they could have gone another 100+ miles. If only the toe box were wider...Tent Lightheart Gear Solong 6 was a great tent overall (minus the issues I had earlier). My trekking pole tips were were frequently packed with mud and I always got an eye full setting up. I really liked being able to set this tent up in the rain due to the frame (trekking poles) being on the inside. I would go with a free standing double wall tent If I were to ever to do this again.Trekking polesCascade Mountain Tech were awesome! The tips needed to be replaced but that's it.SocksDarn tough socks are worth every penny and more. My feet never were cold with these, even that day it snowed in the Smokies.Cook pot/cupI would go with a 500-600 ml pot vs the 1.3 L. next time. All I needed was enough water for coffee in the morning and mac n cheese in the evening and I was good. I spent so much time searching for a cup. So convinced that it needed to be double walled blah blah blah. A blue 16oz cup from the 4 pack of .98 cent plastic cups is all I needed.StoveGlad I packed my ($5.50 chinese knock off) pocket rocket stove. I never bought a gas canister the entire time out there. There was always a canister with enough fuel in the hiker boxes to get me to my next stop. Water collection/filtrationI got rid of the hose to my 2L Platypus and just carried a 1 liter bottle with a sawyer squeeze. I ditched the mini (imagine sucking a thick milkshake thru a straw, yeah that's the mini). I carried way to much water in the beginning. I would go with a 3L wide mouth bag next time and roll it up while hiking and only use it for camp.There was always something sawyer related in the hiker boxes and someone (thanks friendly nate) showed me how to make a waterfall using a rolled up sawyer bag when water is trickling out of a spring.Food bag15L was perfect but one that was wider at the mouth and shorter in length. Maybe one that would be slightly smaller in diameter than the diameter of the pack. Slider ziplocks always brokeEarplugsOne of my favorite pieces of gearPhoneVerizon is a must if your going to journal. When I had time to post something in my journal I never had signal (straighttalk using an AT and T/Tmobile phone). You have to order the conversion sim from walmart which is cheap, $1.99 (I think) but getting to a Walmart, depending on your location can be challenging. After getting the new sim card (verizon) was like night and day. I could get signal more often and actually surf the internet. The few times it rained I put my phone in a ziplock bag and stuffed it in my pack (lined with a contractor bag)Med kit I ended up with only the ace bandage, small roll of medical tape and about 10 tylenol. My other prescription med's were in a ziplock and did fine. The injuries that people had out there were due to going to fast in the beginning and sprained ankles later on. I also learned to put pills in ziplocks so they don't constantly rattle in their bottles.KnifeMy .98 box cutter style knife was all I needed.Battery packAnker 2nd gen astro E1 5200 mAh was perfect. I would bring again.Rain gearFrog toggs was great. Only a few small holes over the trip.PantsI really liked the full zip pants.All other gear performed well.    I would have done more research on campsites for this trip. What I mean is, my goal was always get to the next shelter early in the trip but for example when I had to stop at Justus Creek because I was to tired to push on to Gooch Mountain Shelter. I was disappointed in myself for not making it but glad the next day when I got to the shelter and talked to a hiker who had stayed there the previous night. He said it was way to packed and the tent sites were on a hill. I camped on a level site near a stream, all to myself, it was great! Going to Fontana Dam at night was a great idea. At first I was bummed because distance wise I did not go very far (Fontana Dam Lodge to the Fontana Hilton, 1 mile) but it's a one of those memories I will have forever. Birdie you still owe me a cheese burger for catching the first fish if you are reading this.Food dropsI made a huge mistake of buying the same type of food and shipping it to fontana dam lodge right before I went into the Smokie Mountains. By the time I reached the lodge my preferences for what I liked changed. I didn't like any of the lipton/knorr rice or pasta sides but had a lot of them shipped to me. So I realized for me, I do better with just buying food as I go. FoodHiking in cooler temps is way better for preserving food longer. My diet while hiking consisted of coffee/hot chocolate, honey buns, cheese cake danishes, a block of cheddar cheese, trisquits, summer sausage, mini snicker (almonds), mini milky ways, mac n cheese, tuna packets, probably every kind of granola bar you can think of, bagels, peanut butter, sliced ham, loaf of bread and a variety of flavored drink mixes. I lost between 25-30 lbs in 2 months. When I started the trail I was more concerned about where the next water source was and packed way to much food. I tried to always have nothing left in my food bag when I walked into town. It wasn't until walking into Uncle Johnny's (Erwin, TN.) that I only had 1 bagel left in my food bag.Hostels/places to stayI only did approx 25% of the trail. The ones I would go back to are, Mountain crossings, Blood mountain cabins, Fontana dam lodge, Haven's budget Inn (RIP Baltimore Jack)Franklin,NC. Uncle Johnny's was probably my favorite place! Bob People's Kincora hostel (I really liked him), The woodchuck Damascus VA. as well as the Broken Fiddle then The Appalachian Trail Lodge and the Katahdin Inn. There were a lot of other places I stayed at but ended up there because, for example it's raining and all you care about is a hot shower and dry place to sleep.RelationshipsThere were a few guys and a girl I ran into that also had new relationships just started before hiking the trail. One of them is still hiking (Feel Good). I'm not sure about Mountain Goat. Hula Bear's boyfriend joined her on the trail. Overall, I'm glad that I have my girlfriend. She is the best!!! If I were to do this again I would prefer to either be single or have been in a relationship/married for a longer period of time. Do I miss the trailYes and no...In the beginning like anything else. It's fresh and new. I've got all my gear, feeling pumped about this new adventure, I'm no longer working a job that I wasn't satisfied with...LIFE IS GREAT! For me it wasn't until leaving Kincora and walking towards Damascus that I started to feel that hiking wasn't for me. I just wasn't into the views anymore, my group was so spread out and that's when I realized that I liked hiking into trail towns and spending time with my trail family but hiking just to walk wasn't for me anymore. The trail had given me what I needed at this point in my life, it was rehabilitation for me. I finally regained my mental rank of captain.Do I think I could have made it all the wayWith out a doubt, yes. Physically, Georgia and the beginning of North Carolina weed a lot of people out. I did OK but wish I would have been in better shape. There were people in their 60's and 70's passing me and I will never forget the woman that hiked Katahdin (with a curling iron and high heels in her hip belt). She was running the entire Mountain, passing everyone (her secret is she trains there on the weekends). I think that once you get used to this lifestyle then it all depends on money. Yes I know I spend way to much, way to early but due to the circumstances that is why I did what I did.Would I go backEarly on I remember meeting a guy who was hiking the trail for the third time. Another hiker and I were thinking, why would anyone want to do this over again. But now I know...The Appalachian trail is so many things for so many people. It's an adventure, it's a place for people to figure things out, it's an experience like no other in the world. Everyone is on the same team. Doesn't matter what color you are, gender, or what background you come from. Everyone was cool because we all shared the same goal. The goal was getting to Mt. Katahdin in one season...to be a thru hiker. I think because of my personality that even if I hiked the entire distance, I would have felt the same way when I made it to the sign at the top. It's just a sign...I got more excited when I beat Birdie, Clarity, Exterminator and Truckin in uno (card game).Other things I learnedI could spend all day asking people what gear should I buy and what's the best way to do this...Here's the answer, hike your own hike. People can give you a ton of advice on gear and how to do stuff but the only way I learned was to actually hike the trail myself and figure out what I needed. What nowI moved back to Savannah to be with my girlfriend. Tampa lasted a little while and I'm currently looking for a job. Birdie will be back in Savannah eventually and I'm sure we will get a beer and talk about our adventure.",,Conclusion,"Aug 24, Wed",0
