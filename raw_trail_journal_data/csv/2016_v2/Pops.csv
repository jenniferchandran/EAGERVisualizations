Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517599,"Ok so the big question.... why are you hiking the AT? And yes everybody asks you this question while rolling their eyes in an effort to figure out why you are so crazy that you would walk 2,184 miles (oh wait, I think it's 2,190 miles...they added 6 more miles this year!), sleep outside for 6 mos., get attacked by bears, and bitten by rattlesnakes.  
I like to tell them that I enjoy getting attacked by bears and bitten by rattlesnakes. Well, no not really, but that line is always good for a nervous laugh. I could say that its all about the spiritual thing, you know the solitude, the beauty of Nature, etc. and it is that too, but I think there is something else. I'm 64 years old and will be soon retired. Worked 43 years as an industrial chemist. Raised 3 great kids with my wonderful wife, Anne. Had a lot of fun living my life but didn't always have a lot of time to think about a lot of things. This hike will give me the opportunity to do just that...to think. I know from past hikes I think the craziest things while I'm out there. But sometimes I actually have a revelation, a thought worth remembering. So that's why I am hiking the AT...to have a revelation. I am thinking that this revelation will have something to do with the meaning of Life. NO, LOL! I'm just kidding. But having a revelation of some kind is definitely a goal.
Another reason is, I have this feather I made. I like to make Indian prayer feathers and give My Indian Prayer Feather tied to my pack them to people. I gave one of them to me. Shortly after that I had a revelation I was to carry that feather to the top of Mt Katahdin and tie it to the AT sign. And that's it, all I need to do is walk 2,190 miles in order to carry a feather to the top of Mt. Katahdin. I don't tell many people about this because if I did they would think I was crazy.  Pops 
BTW - I think I should mention that the feather on my backpack is the wing feather from a wild Turkey given to me by a Turkey hunter friend.",,Why are you hiking the AT?,"Nov 20, Fri",0
Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517596,"First let me say I am a gear geek. I love reading about gear, I love looking for gear, and I love using gear on a hike. I know all the weights of my gear and I have that recorded in a spreadsheet! I even have a list of gear that has made the""cut"". That is if there is something I don't like about that piece of gear then woe to that gear. It now resides in the back of my closet, or drawer, or in some box somewhere.
I have put together a list of the gear I'm going to take so I don't forget anything. What surprises me about this list is that it is so long, about 40 items. Yes I know what you are thinking... a long list means this guy is not a lightweight backpacker and he obviously doesn't know what he is doing. Well that might be true but when I look at this list I am thinking that I am going to need all this gear. And when all of this is packed into my pack the base weight is about 20 lbs.
I need to bring this weight down to about 16 lbs. I know my problem is taking too many clothes. I have a lot of apprehension around living outside in early Spring and not having enough layers to keep warm. The only way around this, is to do more cold weather camping so I can convince myself that I need 4 lbs. less clothes. That way I can ""cut"" those unnecessary clothes. <

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517628,"I love to listen to Music while I Hike. Not just because Music takes my mind off my body protesting the pain of a 12-15 mile hike. And it's not about being anti-social. Indeed when I see fellow hikers approaching me on a trail I always take my earphones off in anticipation of a greeting and many times a good conversation. I really like talking to hikers because they are generally happy folks and usually I can learn something from them. Like if there's water up ahead, any bears stalking them (not not really!), what's the best way to eliminate chafe, is there an all-you can-eat buffet in the next town, etc. Ok I digress....
The music I listen to is New Age Music. I like this music because it does not tell you what to think. Artist examples are Enya, Dueter, Liquid Mind, etc. Generally New Age Music doesn't have any lyrics (except Enya, but her lyrics are poetry that I don't understand so same difference). My mind is free to day dream (my nature: I started at a young age which really irritated my grade school teachers). My feelings are free to roam. Joyful or serene feelings, sad or happy...
Now I want to make this distinction perfectly clear because I don't want you guys thinking that this guy is some sort of fluff bunny. New Age Music is different than New Age Thinking. New Age Thinking usually involves incense, strobe lights, aromatherapy, and so on. Well, I do think aromatherapy is kinda neat. 
I am always looking for new tunes to hike by so if any of you New Age Music Lovers out there have any recommendations send them my way. And I will not think you are a fluff bunny! Pops

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517807,"I love to grill. I especially love feeding people who enjoy eating what I grill. My youngest son, when in high school, would bring his guy friends home. And as every parent knows young men love to eat and eat a lot. So I always made it a custom when they came over to grill them steak, chicken, salmon, or whatever in the fridge that night. One young man started affectionately calling me Pops. And it stuck. I became known as Pops.
I love to feed the AT thru hikers at Dicks Creek Gap in GA every year, late March. I fix baked chicken with my secret spices and my wife, Anne, does the accompaniments.  Feeding the AT thru hikers at Dick's Creek Gap on March 28th 2015. I am 2nd from right, Pops, and my wife, Anne, is the woman in the picture. The thru hikers are so appreciative that we always receive more than we give. So what does Pops have to do with this? I have the same affectionate feeling when feeding the hungry thru hikers as I had when I fed my son's hungry young guy friends who all thru hiked the AT in 2012! Pops",,My Trail Name,"Nov 24, Tue",0
Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517913,"For me Spring is my favorite time of year to hike. It is cool enough that sweating is rare. When I reach a perfect thermal balance with the air temperature, clothes, and my body, I feel fantastic while hiking. Furthermore there are essentially no bugs, especially mosquitos and deer flies. And without leaves on the trees there are views everywhere I look. 
So Spring is a very special time to hike the AT. Yes, I know at times it rains continuously for 3-4 days and nothing is warm and dry. But hey, April showers bring May Flowers...right? Correct! And the Spring Flowers along the AT are magnificent. Fellow thru hikers you must and will feel something when you hike thru a Rhododendron Tunnel that is filled with those huge lovely white blossoms.  Mountain Laurel Or the Mountain Laurel that line the Trail when hiking thru Laurel Falls Canyon near Hampton, TN.
My favorite is the Flame Azalea. Flame Azalea
The flowers come in such subtle hues, ranging from orange to red. Individual clusters of six flowers cascading down a branch. Bright orange colors in contrast with the deep green compound leaves. I am awestruck by such beautiful simplicity. No matter how damp and cold I feel, I feel warm again. Pops

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517965,"It is really amazing how good junk food tastes. Another amazing thing about junk food is that we all know it is not particularly good for us but we eat it anyway. In fact we do more than just eat it, we average Americans devour it. Junk food restaurants abound in this country because of the above reasons. 
Putting it mildly, AT Hikers have an even greater affinity for junk food than the average American. This has everything to do with calorie deficit. I have read that the average hiker will burn anywhere from 4-5,000 calories per day. Probably the maximum calories a thru hiker can carry in a back pack during a 6-7 day resupply is about 3,000 calories per day. This leaves a 1-2,000 calorie deficit per day, or 6-12,000 calories in a week. No wonder backpackers have voracious appetites when coming into a Trail Town. Look out all-you-can-eat buffets with bacon!  Indeed my son, the thru hiker, has told me stories that he and his fellow thru hiker friends have been politely asked to leave the restaurant due to their huge buffet food intake.
In order to fill some of the calorie void backpackers eat lotsa pasta coupled with the addition of a fatty calorie booster such as olive oil or butter. One pound of butter has 3,258 calories/lb. which is good bit, but I was surprised to find out that Olive oil is the big winner weighing in at 3,998 calories/lb. (So it is Olive oil for me on the AT.). Hard cheese is a real lightweight at 1,995 calories/lb. Peanut butter is a mediocre 2,665 calories/lb.
A favorite of young male thru hikers is the ""Dollar Menu McChicken Fry Double Stack Cheese Burger"" as pictured. From the name and picture you can figure out how this gastronomical delight is assembled. Not only is this food fare the ultimate in junk food, but is very cheap and packs a whooping 1,100 calories (without extra catsup). Two of these sandwiches coupled with a large triple thick shake washed down with H2O (0 calories) weighs in at 3,310 calories. 
Now I emphatically state that I have never eaten a ""Dollar Menu McChicken Fry Double Stack Cheese Burger"". Sitting here comfortably in front of my computer with my tummy full of my wife's good home cooking, that sandwich doesn't look good to me. However I am wondering, when coming off the AT into a Trail Town on some late night, hungrier than a Tyrannosaurus, will I succumb to the temptation to eat this ultimate in junk food?  Pops

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518171,"In a previous journal entry I stated that I needed a cold weather hike to test out some of my gear in order to lighten my base weight. So last weekend I set out to do exactly that with a weekend ""there and back"" AT hike. My pack weighed in with food and water at about 23 lbs. Minus the food/water about 19.2 lbs. I intentionally took more gear than I knew I would need so I could test it. The results are in the following journal because I got a little long winded. 
I met three SOBOs, Crocman, Catch-up, and Wallbanger and one young man, Trail Blazer, who was section hiking from Bly Gap to Hogpen Gap. The SOBOs were completing a Flip-Flop that started in Harpers Ferry. They should be completing their thru hike on Wednesday, 12/9/2015. Congratulations guys, well done! Catch-up stated that night at supper that he does not sleep in Shelters because of folks snoring...Oh-huh!
Snoring in the AT shelters is like body odor. It's an unpleasant fact of life. Hikers either learn to live with it or do something to minimize their exposure, like wear ear plugs or pitch a tent. Next morning while we were all scarfing breakfast, Catch-up mentioned he could hear someone snoring at a pretty good clip in the Shelter last night while in his tent. Trail Blazer looked right at me, ""It was Pops. Pops, you sounded like a Freight Train."" Oooops!  ""Yes"", I said, ""it goes with being 60+ years old"". In retrospect I realized that that was a close call. I could have easily been tagged with the Trail Name, ""Freight Train"". I hope this doesn't become my new Trail Name since I am quite attached to Pops.   Pops (a.k.a. Freight Train)
P.S. - On this hike I took a picture of the Trail Sign at Chattahoochee Gap that designates the location of the headwaters of the mighty Chattahoochee River. Yes, all it says is ""water"".

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518233,"I have been getting requests as to what gear I am taking on the AT so I sat down tonite and put this table together. I uploaded it as a picture. There is probably a better way to do it using HTML programming (I'll work on this.). 
Ok, I apologize for the lousy picture. However table form seems to be the most information packed way of showing what gear I am taking with me on the AT. Please click for full size in order to read it. Granted not good but readable. I hope this helps. If you email me I will send you the original picture which is much more readable.
My base weight was 19.2 lbs. before the hike. I managed to jettison 1.6 lbs. of ""luxury items"" after the hike to arrive at 17.4 lbs...Oh No! Good Bye Crocs  I am not not going to set any UL BP records but I think this gear set up will keep me comfortable and save me from freezing to death. The column ""Wear Hiking"" in the table was the gear I was wearing last weekend while hiking the AT in Northern GA. Weather was partly cloudy, some wind, and about 50 deg. 
I am sure I will hear about the perils of bringing a down filled sleeping quilt to the AT in the rainy Spring... However the nylon shell is somewhat resistant to water and I do plan to stuff the quilt in a 20 gal plastic compactor bag for safe, dry keeping. IMHO, the big danger in getting the goose down fill moist is my bad habit of sticking my nose inside the quilt while sleeping. I know from experience that condensation from my breath will dampen the goose down fill. Anyway I do have a synthetic bag that weighs about 1 lb. more in standby mode.
BTW - I just noticed that according to the table I was going commando this weekend!  That is, I neglected to put the boxer briefs in the ""Wear Hiking"" Column. I assure you I was wearing boxer briefs. I recently saw a YouTube Video about going commando and ticks. The creepy critters prefer their hiker fare to go commando...you get my drift! Well, of course it is not tick season but on a cool day the boxers are great for keeping the thighs warm.

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518353,"In general, what thru hikers eat when on a thru hike is pretty much the same. That is, lotsa starch such as mac'n cheese, pasta sides, Ramen noodles, oatmeal, trail mix, etc. However how a hiker goes about the preparation in getting the food out there on the Trail can vary widely. My son, the thru hiker, does very little food preparation for a hike, opting for the ""whatever comes my way"" style of preparation. On the other hand, I am quite focused on every last detail about the food before I leave. I believe that time spent in preparation can save a lot of hassles and headaches on the Trail, especially with regard to the diversity of the meals, keeping the body healthy, and having enough (or too much!). IMHO, I believe planning the meals allows one to eat better on the Trail than the ""whatever comes my way"" group. 
Obviously the drop box plays a critical role in the ""focused on every detail"" style of preparation but this is a topic I won't cover in this journal entry. 
A natural result of the ""focused on every detail"" style is a recipe spreadsheet which serves as a guide as to how much to buy of the foods listed. See the attached picture for details. 
An integral part of my food preparation is the Pot Cozy.  Home made Pot Cozy The Cozy serves as a Trail oven. Not only does the Cozy allow one to save enormously on fuel but also allows the hiker to use the 1 qt. freezer bag as the cooking container. Yes, that's right the 1 qt. freezer bag can stand up to boiling water without failing. This means that the hiker does not need to clean his/her cooking pot since the pot is used only to boil water. To me this is huge! I, for one, do not want the hassle of cleaning up my cooking pot when water is limited and then, where does one dump the greywater? Some folks have expressed concern about heating food in the plastic bag and then leaching ""chemicals"" into the food. Plastic food storage bags are made of 100% polyethylene and contain no plasticizers. Polyethylene itself is harmless, and chemically can be compared to paraffin wax. Below is a link on how to make a pot cozy and how to use it.

And like I said, ""If I can do it, you can do it."" Note I used metal duct tape to bind the seams instead of the normal duct tape. 
Another thing you may notice about my recipes, I use a lot of dehydrated milk. This is a matter of personal choice since some folks do not like milk. I find that dehydrated milk adds taste as well as sugar, fat, and protein to my diet. I like the Nestle brand the best, because it disperses easily with no lumpiness as with some of the more economical brands.   Protein Drink Ingredients
The recipes that may be new to you are the protein drink and the instant pudding. Both are highly recommended. The protein drink is a cost efficient and delicious way to add 31 g of much needed protein and almost 300 calorie to one's diet. The instant pudding comes in a huge variety of favors. I like to add grape nuts to my pudding for a crunchy texture. Using graham crackers as a ""dip chip"" allows the pudding to be passed around the campfire. Guaranteed to make you popular with the other hikers! Pops

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518443,"Reading books about hiking is not for everyone, Colin Fletcher wearing his External frame Pack but I think it is time well spent for anyone who is considering a long distance hike. I started reading hiking books in the 70's. My first read was Colin Fletcher's, "" The Man Who Walked through Time"". I was hooked by his thoughtful, philosophical way at describing the most simple things during his hikes. So I immediately purchased his, ""The Complete Walker"". This book, not only filled with memorable quotes, was also a comprehensive review of what equipment one needed in order to do a long distance hike (Yes, Colin was a gear geek like me ). The information in the first edition, as you might expect, is very dated due to the advent of lightweight backpacking and gear.  
Another book I very much appreciated was, ""Grandma Gatewood's Walk"". She was the first woman AT thru hiker and the first ultra lightweight backpacker. An incredibly tough country woman who achieved national notoriety by just walking. Hiking alone was something women did not do especially in the 50's! Instead they were supposed to stay at home and raise 11 children... which she did in spite of an abusive husband. Grandma Gatewood and her Home made Denim Sack 
Books about gear and technique I highly recommend are, ""The Ultimate Hiker's Gear Guide by Andrew Skurka"", the very entertaining read ""Ultralight Backpackin' Tips"" by Mike Clelland, ""Allen and Mike's Really Cool Backpackin' Book"" by Allen O'Bannon, and finally, ""Lighten Up"" by Don Ladigan. 
Books that journal long distance thru hikes I enjoyed are,""A Blistered Kind of Love"" by Angela and Duffy Ballard, Julie Urbanski's ""Between a Rock and a White Blaze"", ""Skywalker"" by Bill Walker, ""Appalachian Adventure"" by Jim Hill and the popular, ""AWOL on the Appalachian Trail"" by David Miller. 
And of course there are many more great books out there not mentioned. Here's hoping that you too may be inspired to get out there and read some good books. As always thanx for your kind attention. Pops

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518507,"To be quite honest I have never considered doing a Flip Flop. I have always assumed I would start like any normal NOBO thru hiker at Springer Mtn. and just hike North to Katahdin. However I have since noticed a number of experienced, older, 'er Senior hikers, are doing just that. That is, starting somewhere midway on the AT and hike NOBO (or possibly SOBO) on their Flip and hike SOBO on their Flop (or possibly NOBO) depending on the time of year. In general it's a matter of personal preference whether one SOBO's or NOBO's on the Flip or Flop. Obvious advantages in doing a Flip Flop are, more flexibility in the starting date, avoiding bugs as much as possible, and the huge NOBO hiker bubble when starting from Springer in early Spring. 
If I would do a Flip Flop, I think my preference would be to NOBO at Harper's Ferry from mid to late May and reach Katahdin 2.5-3 mos. later, and then continue in mid to late August a SOBO hike from Harper's Ferry to Springer. Advantages are no cold weather in Maine and no need to rush to get to Baxter State Park before it closes in October. However I am wondering how buggy Maine is in late July?  Fall Colors on Horse Trough MountainThe late Spring start avoids hiking SOBO in mid summer from Harpers Ferry! HoT, HoT, HoT! and sweaty too... Starting the SOBO Flop (2nd part) from mid to late August and then 2.5-3 mos. later means finishing at Springer in October-November. The big plus for me is the Southern Appalachian mountains are drop dead beautiful in the Fall. I love the Fall colors!
Whew! decisions, decisions! 
I would be interested in hearing any pros-cons from the hiker community out there... Pops
P.S. A really big negative is that my wife, Anne, has been planning to get me out of the house by the end of March and would probably kill me if I told her I was delaying my hike.

No doubt put there by some office hoaxer to see if they could stump me. Ok, I am a curious guy. So I decided to look into the meaning of these numbers further. Obviously they were coordinates of some kind so I put them into the GPS app on my iPhone. What! the waypoint ended up in Southern Kazakhstan. This made no sense.

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518740,"I have decided to change my plans...And I am invoking the HYOH rule. Instead of doing a traditional NOBO from Springer Mtn. I will begin my NOBO Flip on May 15th at Harpers Ferry WV to Katahdin and then SOBO Flop from Harpers Ferry to Springer Mtn. Georgia. This was a not an easy decision, especially playing big was meeting lotsa NOBO thru hikers and making new friends. However there were many reasons to do the Flip Flop instead, some personal, but some practical and some aesthetic. 
Some practical reasons for doing the Flip Flop  Arch over the AT Approach Trail at Amicalola Falls State Park >Not feeling rushed to get to Katahdin before Baxter State Park closes
>Be in northern NE in July when it gets really hot down south (bugs may be an issue though, but I think bugs are an issue everywhere on the AT in July.
>Hike Maine before it starts getting cold
>Not carry as much weight in cold weather clothes.
Some aesthetic reasons are:
>Enjoy the Fall color in the Southern Appalachians which I really love.
>Greater solitude by avoiding the hiker bubble. 
A big personal reason for ending the hike at Springer Mt. is to have my family celebrate my AT thru hike finish and homecoming (we live in Georgia). 
Starting both Flip and Flop in Harpers Ferry(HFY) is perfect. Being the home of the ATC I can register there the day before, and Anne and I can enjoy a nice B&B (Yeh, I had to give in on this one! ) the night before I start. Another big plus is that there is an Amtrak station in HFY. 
 Me at White Blaze #1 on Springer MtnAfter about 2 hours of surfing the net I have figured out how to get to HFY relatively inexpensively. I can hitch a ride from Millinocket ME to Medway ME (or better yet Bangor) and catch a SOBO bus on I95 (CYR Bus Line) to Bangor ME. In Bangor I can catch either Concord or Greyhound (whatever is cheaper) to BOS. In BOS I take the Amtrak to BAL and then transfer to HFY. 
This is the most inexpensive way to get to HFY. Probably be less than $200. So if any of you are considering a Flip Flop I think this is a good way to complete the Loop.

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518971,"Happy New Year to all!
If you happened to have read my journal entry, ""My Gear"", you might recall my base weight is 17.3 lbs. (no this is not a typo...I am moving my nylon boxer briefs out of the ""base weight"" column to the ""wear hiking"" column.). I am working on getting my base weight closer to 15 lb. 
A major change in hiking plans to do a Flip Flop starting on May 15th will automatically reduce my base weight by 13.5 oz. because I can remove my North Face synthetic down jacket due to warmer weather. This puts me at 16.5 lb. within striking range of my 15 lb. base weight target.
I love my Jetboil stove because it boils 2 cups of water lightening fast. However it is not ""lightweight"" especially when the compressed fuel canister is included. The total weight is 26 oz. There is a lighter weight way to boil water and that is alcohol but I don't know much about alcohol stoves, sooooo I did some research on YouTube. In case you do not know, Youtube is a fantastic resource for all sorts of backpacking information. One of my favorite guys to watch on YouTube is Flatbrokeoutside. Here is a link on his research on alcohol stoves: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYw-IW4Q1aU&feature=youtu.be 
Decision time... I have decided to go to a Vargo alcohol stove (1 oz.), a Toaks titanium pot (4 oz.), and a Vargo aluminum wind screen (1.3 oz.). Total weight of this cooking system is only 6.3 oz. The weight loss difference is about 1.2 lb. This brings my base weight to 15.3 lb., 2 lb. less! 
According to Flatbrokeoutside's research an alcohol stove will boil 2 cups of water in about 4 minutes which is about 2x as long as my Jetboil. In retrospect I have to admit that my thinking was influenced by emotion. I always enjoyed blasting that 2 cups of water with so much heat it would boil in 2 minutes. However weight takes precedence over speed. Out with the old and in with the new! Pops",,Out with the Old in with the New,"Jan 03, Sun",0
Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519059,"Some perceptive readers caught me taking a shortcut with regard to my material balance in my previous journal entry, ""Out with the Old and In with the New"". In that entry I wrote about the weight savings of an alcohol stove (Vargo)has over a compressed fuel stove (Jetboil). They correctly pointed out I should have accounted for the alcohol fuel. So shame on me for taking this shortcut but I think it had something to do with watching the TCU-Oregon game in late hours of Saturday evening while writing the above referenced journal entry (My excuse). If you aren't a college football fan you may not know that TCU was down 31-0 at one point in the game but then staged an historic comeback to win in triple overtime. Wow! Amazing! Gotta love those TCU players that never gave up! But I digress, again!
Ok, back to the issue at hand because I think it is an important one for backpackers and especially those who are trying to cut down the weight of their packs. And as every backpacker should know every ounce matters. 
Above is a picture of a data spreadsheet comparing a Jetboil stove (compressed gas) vs. Alcohol stove system. In the first part of spreadsheet I did not include the weight of the fuel only the parts of the stoves that do not change weight...which is everything but the fuel! The Jetboil weighs in at 1.16 lb. whereas the alcohol stove system weighs in at 0.42 lb. This gives a difference of 0.74 lb. (3/4 lb.) clearly in favor of the alcohol stove system. I did not include my Cozy because it so happens that I can use the same Cozy for both stoves...therefore a constant. Left to Right: Windshield, Titanium Pot, Fuel Bottle and Funnel, Pot Cozy, Long Handled Spoon, and center Alcohol Stove 
However the 2nd part of the spreadsheet is where the comparison boils (pun intended) down to personal preference or truly a HYOH situation. The Jetboil literally blows the Vargo out of the water (another pun!) when comparing speed of boiling 2 cups of water and fuel efficiency. The Jetboil boils 2 cups in 2 minutes and 30 seconds whereas the alcohol stove system takes as long as 9 minutes 40 seconds. Probably the most significant finding is that the fuel usage is much less with the Jetboil. Only 5 grams compressed gas vs. 13 grams of alcohol were required to boil those 2 cups. This means a compressed gas fuel canister can boil 45-2 cups whereas a full 8.5 oz alcohol bottle boils only 15-2 cups. To me this is the decision point, if you like fast boils and like to drink a lot of hot beverages on the Trail then I think the compressed gas stove is the way to go. However I do not drink hot drinks. Typically I have three hot breakfasts (1cup) and 6 hot dinners (2cups) in a weeklong hike (or between drop boxes). This is equivalent to boiling 7.5-2 cups. I would use about 1/2 of my 8.5 oz. bottle of alcohol in a week. This is plenty of fuel to spare.
Yes, fuel consumption and lack of flame control (simmer) can be a problem with an alcohol stove. However I find this is where the pot Cozy really shines. I never simmer anything on a stove including when using a Jetboil. As soon as the water boils I pour it into my 1qt freezer bag containing food (blow out the alcohol stove), then place the food bag in pot, and place pot with food bag into the Cozy for about 15 minutes. This is usually enough time to rehydrate freeze dried food, Ramen noodles, etc. And the food is quite hot after this process. So a Cozy can make up for lack of a simmer mode of an alcohol stove and save a lot of fuel. 
If there is any alcohol left, I wait for the stove to cool and pour the remaining alcohol back into the fuel bottle using a funnel. This is the most dangerous aspect of burning alcohol, one cannot see the flame easily and therefore must make absolutely sure the alcohol is not burning. People have set their back packs on fire by packing an alcohol stove that was not completely extinguished.
I think this type of decision is a great example of HYOH and the critical thinking a lightweight backpacker goes thru when making a decision. Whew! who would have thought that hiking was so complicated! Pops",,Alcohol Stove System vs. Jetboil,"Jan 05, Tue",0
Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519373,"This entry is written for not only the hiker but also for those incredibly wonderful support folks (here's huggin' and kissin' ya!) back at home. I can say with confidence that there are many hikers that give testimony to the fact that they would not have completed their hike without the support of their loved ones, both family and friends.
One of the best ways a loved one can show support is thru the drop box. The drop box on the Trail is bigger than Xmas! Especially if it comes loaded with homemade goodies which is sorely lacking in the thru hiker's diet. Of course goodies can mean all sorts of things from chocolate chip cookies to beef jerky. 
Along this line I am always on the lookout for packable recipes that are easy to make and are very nutritious. Nutrition is always a problem on the Trail because most thru hiker's diet consists largely of processed, starchy foods. Fitting into the nutritious, packable category is Alton Brown's (I am a fan!) granola bar recipe (delicious too) but granola bars are not easy to make in my opinion. Though the Betty Crocker's out there might disagree with me. 
I found a nutritious recipe for homemade Larabars on ""100daysofrealfood.com"" by Lisa Leake. Super easy to make and in my taste test I graded them as superb. However there are literally endless combinations of these versatile, nutritious delights which allows for a lot of experimentation with regard to personal taste (I always enjoy being the guinea pig). 
For instance puree the pitted dates into a dough with a food processor, then put the dough in a Kitchenaid mixer equipped with a kneader blade and mix in all sorts of good stuff such as dried fruit i.e., apples, cherries, craisins, blueberries, or any kind of nuts. I would mix enough good stuff into the dough until I get a consistency that is ideal for forming into bars. 
My path forward is to do what I love to do and that is experiment, and find out what combinations I like the best. And then of course pass the recipes onto my family and friends who will be very happy to make Larabars for me while I am on the AT!  Pops",,A Recipe for the Drop Box,"Jan 08, Fri",0
Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519435,"I have confessed in a past entry that I am both a gear geek as well as a bookworm (which equals a nerd!), so predictably I have been out on the web reading all sorts of stuff about alcohol stoves. It turns out that there is a huge hiker-nerd community that loves to tinker with their alcohol stoves in all sorts of ways. Well, being a chemist I just had to find out what alcohol fuels are available and how do they work in my stove. I decided to write a journal entry about my findings because some of you hikers out there who have an alcohol stove (or those thinking about buying one) may find the information useful.
Below is a table with the data on boiling 2 cups of water (~454g).
 Five Different Fuels Evaluated with the Vargo Alcohol Stove
The 5 readily available types of fuel I looked at were: Yellow HEET, Red HEET, 190 Proof Grain Alcohol, Denatured Alcohol, and 91% IsoPropyl Alcohol. For those not familiar with alcohol stoves, the time to bloom is the time it takes the stove's outside burner jets to fire. The stove ""blooms"" and has the shape of a flower. The time to boil includes the bloom time. 
The surprise for me is the time to boil. It is essentially the same for all fuels! Even though the products contain various types of alcohol with varying heat content. Therefore boil time is not an important factor when deciding what fuel to use. I think from the study the location to buy, or availability, could be the most important factor because a hiker due to limited mobility, and the limited selection in small towns, will buy whatever is readily available. Considering that and soot generation (who likes to clean a sooty pot!) the winner in my opinion is Yellow HEET. Furthermore Yellow HEET comes in convenient lightweight 12oz bottle which should be plenty of fuel for me on a one week interval between resupplies. 
Considering the amount of fuel consumed (burn efficiency) the 190 proof grain alcohol wins hands down over Yellow HEET, 9g vs. 15g. It burns cleanly and efficiently, but in some states it is not available and many times there is no liquor store in the small town one finds themselves. And the 750 ml. glass jar is not easily carried. Ok, so I know what you're thinking,""gee, this sounds like something I could drink""...for the HYOH crowd this presents an interesting decision. If one enjoys imbibing responsibly after a long day of hiking then this may be the fuel of choice since one can drink this fuel. 

However some caveats, I am NOT recommending one drink 190 proof alcohol but if one chooses to do so then 190 PROOF ALCOHOL SHOULD BE DILUTED 1:1 WITH WATER BECAUSE 95% ETHANOL COULD HAVE SERIOUS PHYSICAL EFFECTS ON THE MOUTH AND THROAT.
 THE OTHER FUELS ARE POISONOUS AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSUMED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.
I did not try the 91% Isopropyl alcohol because red HEET is 100% Isopropyl alcohol and I definitely did not like the sootiness of the burn. It coated the bottom of my pot completely making a mess to clean up. The 91% would be even sootier due to 9% water content. On the other hand, the denatured alcohol is a very good choice but would probably not be readily available and is only available in a 32 oz. metal can...not convenient and too heavy. 
Ok so I hope this information helps. I know it helped my thinking about what fuel to buy. Let me know what you guys think! Pops 
BTW - An effective way to extinguish the stove is to place the pot over the burning stove thereby suffocating the flame. This is a good method only if you use 1 qt. freezer bags with Cozy to ""simmer"" your food in. However I have found that the Vargo stove blows out easily. 
BTW, BTW - FYI, when the stove blooms I place a penny over the stove's fill hole (in the center) using tweezers. This is to increase pressure to the outside burner jets, thereby increasing burn efficiency via increased oxygen mixing. This is a common technique and one reason why this is called a ""penny stove"".",,Fuel for the 'er....Stove!,"Jan 09, Sat",0
Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519556,"It's Winter and only the strong hearted are out on the AT hiking. The rest of us mere hiking mortals are safe and warm, tucked away in our homes enjoying football and maybe having a beer, or two...or three! I don't want to sound pedantic in this journal entry but you know all of us should be at the gym exercising to get ready for our upcoming trials and tribulations on the Trail.  
Yes, I know, the gym does not prepare one completely for a trail filled with slippery tree roots, Judas rocks, and what seems to be near vertical ups and downs. Only hiking a rugged trail can simulate the Trail. I emphasize rugged because the North Georgia Mountains of the AT are rugged...and guess what, it gets ""ruggedier"" as one approaches North Carolina. (Pun alert!) The ruggedness finally peaks in the Smokies about 200+ miles later. Not fun at all if one hasn't prepared themselves both mentally and physically. Most would-be thru hikers drop out in this rugged stretch, leaving the 20% or so left (the too stubborn to quit crowd) to find their way to Katahdin. 
Finally, and this is probably the most important reason for going to the gym, if one is not in good physical condition then the chance of injury increases dramatically. Twisting one's ankle is a common injury. Doing calf raises, increases ankle strength and allows the ankle to resist twisting to the point of injury. I am very klutzy so I am prone to twisting an ankle. However I believe that my ankles remain unsprained because they are strong enough to resist the twist when I make a klutzy move. (I'll probably go hiking this Winter and sprain my ankle!) 
Another good gym exercise I like is the elliptical. I believe it improves balance as well as overall leg strength. I peddle forward for 5 minutes and then backward for 5 minutes. I do this for 20 minutes and feel the BURN Babeee! Hurts sooo good!  
Backward peddling strengthens the leg muscles that power you downhill...and guess when most injuries occur? Right, hiking downhill! 
So get Thee to the the Gym! In fact, tomorrow morning I'll be there! Pops

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519719,"An interesting thing happened to me when I started hiking. I changed my thinking about water. As a hiker I realized how truly important water is to my happiness and well being. Indeed, many times I ask fellow hikers traveling in the opposite direction, ""Is there water up ahead and how far?""... I silently groan when I arrive at a shelter and find out that the water source is >1/2 mile further down the blue blaze trail... Dry camping is the pits...As a thirsty hiker I'm ecstatic when I find cold, pure spring water bubbling up from the ground...etc. But in reality on the AT water is very abundant and most times finding water is not a problem for me. Generally it is very clear and purifying it is easy.
In the ""real world"" I take water and the fact it is clean for granted. In my home clean water is just a few feet away. And I enjoy having ice cubes in my glass of water when I eat a meal. If I do not want to drink the tap water I can buy filtered water in a bottle, which is the ultimate in convenience. Wow! I have come to realize I have it made.  
On our western desert Trails, water cannot be taken for granted at all for risk of dehydration. Access to water always dictates the distance and direction of one's hike. And the water at times is very dirty and must be purified carefully. 
Kenyan Women at the well
Likewise in the desert of northwest Kenya, the natives deal with the lack of water and clean water every day of their lives. Young mothers walk as many as 9 miles one way every day to carry 5 gals of water for daily use. The time and distance requires the grandmother to raise the children. Many times the water is unclean and a carrier of disease. Clean, pure water that is located nearby a village is an incredible gift to these people and can change their lives enormously for the better.
As a part of my AT thru hike I am ""trekking for water"". That is, I am hiking for funds for a well to be drilled nearby a village in the western desert of Kenya . An example of a pledge, if you are interested, would be one penny per mile that I walk or $21.90 when I finish. I hope that my hike, and with help from donors, can raise enough money necessary for the drilling and pump for a well.

At my tender age I am very familiar with the fact of life that good friends come and go in one's life for all sorts of reasons. The Trail will be like that too. I know I will make some really good friends on the Trail but after the Trail, they too will go their separate ways.

I am looking forward to retirement. Most of all not being a slave to the clock. I want to have the freedom to come and go as I please. I am weary of having to be somewhere as dictated by some one or some organization. I think this is one of the main attractions of the Trail. The Sun will rule the day and night.

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520422,"In this modern world of ours we have many items of luxury at our beck and call. Hot showers, a refrigerator full of goodies, soft bed to sleep on, a car so we don't have to walk anywhere, a TV with all the sports we could ever want! Just to name a few. So then why should we go off into the woods to hike and deny ourselves these luxuries??? And especially over a long period of time! Must be nuts, right? Or masochistic? Or maybe we just love hiking. 
There are many reasons why I love hiking. One of the most important reasons for me is what I call the ""Zen point"". When I am hiking over a long distance, there is a point during the hike when my body feels like a machine. My arms and legs are working, and working hard, but I feel comfortable and happy. I feel no pain. I have reached the ""Zen point"". 
For me to reach the Zen point, my body must achieve thermal equilibrium with the air temperature, that is, my body is warm and comfortable, though the air temperature could be very cold at times. A soft breeze adds to my happiness. One caveat: I am very mindful of the slightest onset of sweating. If I feel a sweat coming on I immediately take off an item of clothing and continue to do this until my body is back to thermal equilibrium (And no, I never hike nude! ). Sweating interrupts the Zen point because it makes me feel uncomfortable.
At the Zen point my body is not intruding on my mind. My mind is not thinking per se...it is floating freely with the beauty of the Trail. I see the rocks, the roots, the trees, the plants, the twists, the turns, the ups and downs...all that is about me. My body responding automatically to whatever is coming my way. I am not thinking about the miles, or where I have to be by sunset. Time is not important. I feel completely free and happy...and alone. The Solitude of the AT Below Springer Mtn.
Solitude is another important element for reaching the Zen point. I cannot be worried or concerned about a partner. This is why I prefer to hike solo. People hiking toward me snap me back momentarily, because I always give them a friendly greeting. IMHO this is why solitude is important to solo hikers because solitude is necessary for achieving the Zen point. Many hikers do not consciously realize they have achieved a state of Zen when hiking over long distances. They just know they feel totally free and happy, in complete harmony, surrounded by the beauty of Nature.
So why am I telling you this? I think it is important we all find something we can do that allows us to achieve the Zen point, a state of happiness and freedom. And we need to do this as often as possible. For me that activity is hiking over a long distance in the beauty and solitude of Nature. Pops",,The Zen of Hiking,"Jan 31, Sun",0
Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520861,"Just got back from my there and back hike this weekend. Met some really cool thru hikers and I thought I would use this entry to pass on what I learned about them.
Milkman is about my age, that is >60 years old. He retired at 58 (lucky dog!). I have to admire Milkman. His first AT attempt ended in Connecticut where he fell and tore his meniscus ending his thru hike. Because he could not finish the AT in that year he is starting again from the beginning at Springer Mountain. I am totally humbled by the thought of his focused determination to thru hike the entire AT inside of 1 year.
Peanut Butter and Banana (I love this name combination!) are hiking as a team. Banana is a 24 year old young woman from Charleston SC. She is solo hiking the AT with her dog Peanut Butter. I admire her courage as a woman solo hiker. When talking about women solo hiking she dismissed the idea of ""creepos"" being a problem because 99.9% of everybody out here were people of good moral standing. She did say her Mom was ""flipping out"". Hey Mom, Banana is doing just fine. She's having a great time and doing what she needs to do. She does think about you a lot and believes you are the greatest Mom in the world. 
Sixty and Almost Sixty are two young thru hiker guys from Florida. They got their Trail Names by both starting their hike with 60 lb. packs. They claimed that their packs are alot lighter now. However looking at their packs I was thinking that there was still a lot more in them than I could carry. Good thing they are young and strong! They were quite considerate by offering me a cup of hot tea on a very cold winters night.
Stealth is a very pleasant thirty something guy who has a quiet demeanor. He does not like to camp at shelters where the snoring and noise can be a problem. I surmise he is into solitude and prefers to ""stealth"" camp. As we hiked together talking about 10 wild boars jumped out of the brush and ran away from us! I was quite glad that they ran the other way!! Stealth was on his way to Hiawassee where he could watch the Super Bowl on Sunday evening and then hunker down for the coming winter storm. 
DoBro is a blue grass musician who carries a portable dobro on his pack while section hiking the AT. Dobro has almost completed the southern half the AT. He then plans to start the northern half (above Harpers Ferry) sometime this year. He was lamenting the loss of his hiking companion, insofar that he could not get him interested in completing the AT section hike they had started together. Dobro himself is undaunted and is determined to finish the AT as a solo section hiker.
These are the fascinating folks I met on my short weekend hike. I am very excited about meeting more thru hikers when I start my hike in May. Pops",,Early 2016 Thru Hikers on the Trail,"Feb 08, Mon",0
Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528533,"It's been awhile since my last entry but I have been busy with many things. However as my AT lift off, May 15th, approaches, I find my life and thoughts are more and more revolving around this date. I would not be truthful if I told you I was not getting excited.
One of my big tasks I just completed was to fill my drop boxes with food, snacks, hygiene stuff, Meds (yeh, I am 65), new shoes and socks, and map sections (AWOL's AT Guide), etc. Twenty one drop boxes is about 1 drop box per 100 miles, especially if drop box zero is taken into account (my fully loaded pack at the beginning of the hike).  
Upon reflecting how much effort goes into the planning of drop boxes one could consider not doing drop boxes. That is, do the ""Whatever Comes My Way"" planning, which is equivalent to no planning at all. My youngest son, Dan, (A.K.A. ""Mission""), who successfully thru hiked the AT in 2012, utilized this technique. He did not plan even one drop box, though his mother and I sent him a few out of concern for his well being. Of course he had one huge advantage over me, a younger body that could take much more abuse.
So probably my biggest reason for planning so many drop boxes is my age. Age requires one to tilt the board to their advantage any way they can. As a Senior Citizen, outside of not injuring myself hiking the AT, I think the use of drop boxes could very well be one of the best ways of insuring success. Besides if you're a planning freak like me it can be fun as well as increase one's knowledge of the AT. 
Below is a listing of my drop box locations. Of course this is a Flip Flop version so it starts at Harper's Ferry at the NOBO Flip and SOBO Flop. I am putting this in the journal so folks out there who may not like planning to the nth degree could find it useful. I tended to choose the US post office locations for convenience of pick up, that is, walk-ability from the AT (but not always) and at roughly 100 mile intervals. If a hostel is listed then that is the drop box destination.

Found the ATC and went inside, where I was met by a very pleasant looking, grey haired fellow with the name tag, "" Dave T."" As I spoke to him I realized I was smelling something not very pleasant. Where had I had smelled this before? It was the same fragrance my son, Dan, had when we picked him up in Millinocket ME after completing his AT thru hike.

Pops Sr. assured me that this being the last day of his section hike that he was to leave the shelter late and then take it easy hiking to Pen Mar. We said our goodbyes and I headed out at about 2.5 mph, a good hiking pace. I was thoroughly enjoying the beautiful morning in the pastoral countryside of Maryland. At about 4.4 miles out I heard someone coming up from behind me fast. It was Pops Sr. hiking at a ""kick my butt"" pace. ""Hey, what's goin' on! Thought you were going to take it easy today"". He just smiled and blasted past me. I realized he had been sandbagging me! This 69 year old could pick'em up and put'em down. After about an hour of hiking in solitude the trail started getting very rocky, steep and almost indiscernible amongst all the big rocks. At the same time the white blazes disappeared. No problem! I pulled out my handy dandy GPS and started tracking the AT, keeping the black arrow (me) on the red line of trail. Heard voices, and Pops Jr. and Pops Sr. emerged from the underbrush. ""What a surprise!"" I said. ""We're lost, can't find the trail,""said Pops Jr. ""No problem, I got my GPS. Just follow me.""

I was moving slower since It was a really dreary, wet morning with a light rain falling. I wanted to make Quarry Run Shelter at 15 miles but willing to compromise with Rocky Mtn. Shelter at 10 miles.About 10:30 am the sun tried to come out, started feeling warmer, so I started dressing down to prevent getting too warm, I.e., getting my clothes wet by sweating. However about an hour later it started getting cold, the rain started up again, so I started putting clothes back on. Got the umbrella out. It was great. Kept my core dry and never got cold, though the temperature was about 50 deg. The umbrella worked so well I'm surprised more hikers don't use one. Decided not to go on because the weather was getting soupier so I stopped at Rocky Mtn. Shelter for the night. Later Hedgehog and TW hiked in with the same thinking. Nasty evening shaping up...

Unfortunately peering out the shelter opening it looked like another dreary day shaping up, gray sky, drizzly, and in the 50s. Hedgehog, TW, and I all broke camp at about 8:30 am... a late start. Quarry Run shelter seemed too close at 5 miles for tonite, so if the weather didn't deteriorate but got better, then Birch Run at 14 miles out seemed a good goal. Initially the Trail was all downhill interspersed with steep climbs over piles of large boulders. Challenging and could not hurry this. One fall would result in a serious injury with nothing but wet rocks to cushion a fall. At about 3.5 miles we crossed State Hwy 30. TW bid us adieu in order to hitch into Fayetteville PA to resupply. We continued to Caledonia State Park with a smooth, level Trail. Hiking was soon to get physical with a 1,000 foot climb over the next 2 miles. However once there, the Trail held the high ground for the next 6 miles to Birch Run Shelter with only one 250 foot drop at the Milesburn Cabin. We rested at that very pleasant spot for 15 minutes. We were fortunate. The weather stayed relatively good, with little rain, increasing temperature to about 60 deg. but no Sun. The Trail was very level with good tread. Made excellent time. We arrived at Birch Run Shelter at about 3:30 pm with 14 miles under our belts! Birch Run is a beautiful shelter with a spacious porch, a clean, clear stream and bunks for our sleeping bags. Feeling pretty good about our 14 mile accomplishment, Hedgehog and I reckoned we had a good shot at making James Fry Shelter at 1109 mile marker, 17 miles ahead. We wouldn't be considering but the weather looked to be improving tomorrow and the terrain would be mostly down hill with no steep climbs. Pops","Rocky Mtn. Shelter

Hedgehog blasted past me down the trail, her younger legs much faster than my plodders. This was quite OK since I wanted to spend the hiking time in solitude. The first 4 miles were very easy with hiking through a relatively flat wetlands called the ""Big Pines Flat Barrens"". The only irritation being the soggy condition of the trail in some places. Oddly saw few pine trees, mostly short hardwoods stunted due to the wetness of the terrain. I passed the 1094 mile marker in this section which is the true halfway point of the AT. Interesting that the halfway point is marked by a very nondescript sign out in the middle of nowhere. However rather fitting due to the non commercial nature of the AT. I signed the logbook and hiked on.Descending about 800 feet in about 3 miles I came to Toms Run Shelter where Hedgehog was relaxing at a shady picnic table. I decided to take an early, light lunch since it was only 10:30 am. This section of southern PA is quite delightful to see with many clear, cold water creeks cris-crossing the Trail. Good thing I only took a light lunch because the next big Trail attraction was the General Store at Pine Furnace PA. run by friendly proprietors, Tim and Michelle. This store is famous for hikers eating 1/2 gal. of ice cream at 1 sitting, ""the 1/2 gallon Hiker Challenge"". I decided not to partake of such massive gluttony and settled on eating a mere Hiker Burger consisting of 1/2 lb. cheese burger, avocados, onions, tomato slice and a fried egg. I ended up having to eat it with a fork being a rather sloppy eater. Afterwards I didn't resist the hand dipped peach ice cream cone to top it all off. Yummy! A very pleasant surprise was seeing Mustard Seed sitting at a table indulging his appetite too. Hauling my bloated body out of town I headed north for the last 7 miles of the day's hike. I could feel an afternoon thunderstorm brewing with the humidity rapidly increasing giving a mid summer stuffy feel to the hike. Soon the wind started picking up bringing cooler air with it... Huh oh! Yep thunderstorm for sure. I picked up my pace to get to the James Fry shelter about 3 miles away. This was the longest 3 miles of the day, getting a little tired now with a thunderstorm chasing me. As I arrived at the shelter a lightening bolt crackled overhead. As I ducked into the refuge it began to pour cats'n dogs. I was safe warm and dry for the evening. Pops","Birch Run Shelter

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534798,"May 24, 2016, mile marker 1109 - Last night we had a full shelter of 6 hikers, Big Sky, BC, Tumbleweed, Hedgehog, Mustard, and myself. Even though I got a late start at 8:30 am I was one of the first to leave. However I wasn't in a big hurry since I had developed a couple of blisters on the right foot. I didn't want them to get any worse so the plan was to do only 8 miles to Alec Kennedy shelter, just 4 miles outside Boiling Springs, PA. The weather was on my side for once with brilliant sunshine and a light breeze. Great day for drying the dampness out of socks, shoes, clothes, and pack. The first 4 miles consisted of one gradual of up/down and after the blisters decided to stop complaining it was a very enjoyable hike in the sunshine. However the last 4 miles beginning with Old Town Road was more difficult with two 500 foot ascends and descends in quick succession. What I didn't know is that the tops of these small mountains were covered with large boulder fields. This of course slowed me way down having to pick my way carefully over and around the boulders, following the serpentine path of the AT. Following the white blazes was not always easy either, reappearing and disappearing on the small trees growing amongst the rocks. Furthermore following the blazes closely was important because getting off trail would lead to dangerous hiking with the many tight crevasses and high ledges. I probably made at best 1 mph compared to my normal 2.5 mph. Indeed at the end of the day I felt like I had hiked 12 miles instead of the actual 8 miles. I pulled into Alec Kennedy Shelter at about 2:30 pm. No one was there which made me quite happy because I had some basic chores to complete. One was readjusting the height of the shoulder straps on my pack which were not high enough for my torso length. If the torso length is too short then the result is the shoulder straps transfer pack weight from the hips, where it should be, to the shoulders. After awhile this can cause painful cramping, not pleasant. That done, I went on to the next. Not nearly as pleasant. Yep, treating my blisters. While hiking I remembered my Mom teaching me that the best way to heal a blister was to dry it out. The best way to dry a blister was to swab with alcohol... Ouch!!! Burn city! With my blisters treated and pack adjusted I'm ready for my nero day. A short 4 mile hike to Boiling Springs, pick up drop box, check into a hostel, get clothes washed, back out on Thursday ready to make miles. Such a life in the long green tunnel!

Stopped in at the ATC branch office where I had lotsa questions for Kelly, a wonderful young woman, with lotsa patience for answering the same questions over and over again. Walked across the street to the USPS to pick up drop box #1.

With the demise of the hostel, Allenberry, they decided to start up their own hostel to fill the void. We had a fun evening sitting around a fire roasting hot dogs.Thursday's morning Sun was blotted out by low hanging clouds that usually dissipate by noon. This is good because the first 13 miles of the total 14.5 mile hike will be across a scenic valley filled with fields, pastures and barns. Some of mileage will be without shade...And the water in the creeks is not recommended due to the farming activity. The pack, already heavy from being newly resupplied with 7 days food, will gain a couple more pounds with the extra water. I keep thinking about ways to reduce pack weight but the end result is always a reduction in my standard of living. One big gift today from the Gods of the AT is that the valley is very flat... Yes! No mountains to climb! Except the last 1.5 miles features a 500 foot trudge out of the valley. This will not be fun after hiking in hot, humid sunshine all day.Ok so here I am on a cool Friday morning sitting at the picnic table at Darlington shelter and yes yesterday's hike across the valley was hot and humid.

Had a fun time yesterday afternoon in Duncannon. I hitch hiked out to Mutzaboughs-Rite Aid to pick up some essentials like a 10 piece fried chicken from the deli! I had bought extra pieces for the hungry hikers at the Riverfront Campground. I ended up eating 7 pieces. Left there around 2pm in steamy hot 90 deg heat headed for The Doyle in downtown. 
When I got there I promptly sat down at the bar and ordered a Yuengling. Miss Vicki, the proprietor, served up a cold one and we talked. She's from Southern Mississippi and an LSU fan. I asked if there was wifi. She said,"" Yes."" ""What's the password?"" I asked. Her response surprised me when she said,"" What did your Mother teach you?"" Looking at me in a way that made me feel really young. ""Oh yes, Please and Thank You!"" I said. ""Please may I have the password?"" She smiled and gave it to me. 
Two beers later and a nice cooling off I headed out into the late afternoon sun for a raspberry ice cream cone at the 3B all the while heading in the direction of the campground. Yes, the three things hikers cannot turn down are Fried chicken, beer, and ice cream.
Broke camp early at 5:30 am for a 1 mile trek across 2 bridges at the confluence of the Juniata and Susquehanna Rivers and then a steep 700 foot climb out of the River valley. Walking the sidewalk across the bridges was not fun. It appears that the local spiders weave webs during the night to catch the newly hatched flys emerging from the river. Thousands of webs with their owners were hanging across the sidewalk. A horror for you arachnophobic folks. I was constantly waving my trekking poles to break thru the webs. Needless to say I survived unscathed (except for a wasp sting on the back) and am now safely ensconced at Peters Mtn Shelter with an assortment of hiker types. Pops

For instance one must be detailed about where the items important to your trail comfort should be put. Every item has a place, a spot where it is to be put away and put away immediately after use. Otherwise one will surely lose that item at some point in the hike. I have had already lost a sock, sun glasses and almost lost my multi use tool several times because I did not put the it away immediately in the proper place.

Got a late start because it was hard getting out of my nice warm sleeping bag and greeting the cold morning air. It was very nice day to hike, breezy, sunny, and in the 60s all day long. However just as Festus and Skidmark predicted the Trail was filled with embedded small rocks all the way to Kirkridge shelter just 6 miles outside of Delaware Water Gap (See picture of embedded rocks in the Trail). After 13 miles of nonstop rocks my feet were ready to crash at the Shelter. When walking in rocks hiking is very tiring because it shortens the stride one can take considerably so walking 13 mikes is the same as walking 20 miles with regard to the number of strides. 
Couple of nights ago at the Bake Oven Knob Shelter Skidmark, Festus, Ranger and I were awoken by a, ""Rumpf! Rumpf! Rumpf!"" noise. This noise loudly resonated thru the shelter. Initially I thought it was someone's weird phone alarm going off. Skidmark turned on his headlamp and a porcupine with eyes blinking from the light looked up at him. Undeterred the porcupine continued chewing on the shelter's wood, ""Rumpf! Rumpf! Rumpf!"". Never leaving his bunk Skidmark picked up his trekking pole and started poking the porcupine. Reluctantly the porcupine retreated into the woods.   Porcupines enjoy chewing a shelter's wood. They do this for the saltiness of the hikers' sweat. So anywhere a hiker sits or lays in a shelter many times you can see the teeth marks where a porcupine has been chewing on the wood. This of course is a big problem for a shelter's maintenance.

Momma Goose, a seasoned thru hiker, was there to greet me. I promptly got out my sleeping bag and slept for over an hour. While I was sleeping I missed a friendly bear making his appearance at Veggie Stew's tent. The best expertly checked out the tent for any food, didn't find any and left. Veggie Stew put his tent away and set up in the shelter. Indeed all the normal tent hikers set up in the shelter for the night. There were 9 of us in the shelter which normally sleeps 5. But an important thru hiker rule is ""there's always room in the shelter""! Pops","Raccoon Ridge

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538060,"June 13, 2016 mile marker 1324Another milestone for me today... I have now put 300 trail miles under my belt! I have been out here almost a month so I feel like I can offer some sage advice to all those wannabes out there. No, not really! I feel like I've learned a lot but I think I have a lot more to learn. Putting one foot in front of the other day in and day out has gained a new respect for me. I have read where hiking the AT requires about 2+ million steps yet just one misstep can end a hike. I think about that especially when I am hiking a particularly difficult section of the Trail. In the cynical humor department the day's picture is one that shows two white blazes not more than 10 feet apart. This makes me laugh because there are times when hiking thru a rocky area the Trail direction is not obvious. There is no white blaze to be found. Leaving one to yell into the empty forest, ""Where the heck is the white blaze?!"" Good night everybody! Pops","Brink Road Shelter

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538146,"June 14, 2016 mile marker 1334While I was waiting for my free soda (customary for thru hikers!) at the High Point State Park Office, a camper lady was complaining to the Park Ranger about the numerous ticks and how disgusting it was. She thought they should do something about it and furthermore demanded her money back. I thought this was curious since ticks are a part of thru hiker life, kind of like eating and sleeping. It's not unusual at all to find a tick trying to find a nice place to set down on your body so inspecting one's legs, etc. is routine... Like brushing your teeth. I suppose me finding this conversation curious is one indication that I have crossed over and become native. That is I have become what thru hikers fondly refer to themselves as hiker trash!

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538349,"June 15, 2016 mile marker 1350Unlike yesterday's hike ( which had many rocks in the Trail) today's 13 mike hike had very few rocks and was relatively flat, but very sunny and hot. About midway in the hike I stopped at the Jim Murray Cabin located just 100 yards off the AT. I didn't plan on staying there for the night because the cabin was only 5 miles away from my start point. There is a free hot shower which is a big attraction for thru hikers. It's an open air shower (see picture) but for hiker trash this is not a problem. The shower felt great!

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538418,"June 16 2016, mile marker 1357Originally I planned to do 12 miles to Wayawanda Shelter today but I noticed swelling around my left ankle yesterday. I had somehow sprained it, but not badly since I could readily walk on it. However the swelling has gotten worse today. So I have changed plans and will hike 7 miles to NJ Route 94 in order to hitch hike into Vernon NJ, nero today and zero Friday to rest it. Part of the hike, about 1.5 miles, was the famous AT boardwalk over wetlands. Very pretty. This is where the kamikaze mosquitos hang out but I think I am early in the human hunting season so I escaped unbitten. During the hike I met a father/son duo day hiking the wetlands. The son who was carrying some impressive photography equipment started asking me some very good questions about thru hiking. It was obvious he knew how to interview people. I told him my name was Pops. His was Christopher King of Endless Echo. We bid each other adieu and I continued my NOBO hike with Christopher going in the opposite direction. I arrived at NJ Route 94. Hung out in parking area for a bit hoping to corral a ride to Vernon but to no avail. So I decided to start road walking the 2.5 miles to Vernon. I barely put out my hand to hitch hike and a car stopped! It was Christopher and his father!!! Wow! Talk about coincidence! He gladly took me to the hiker hostel, St. Thomas Episcopal Church.   Thank you Christopher!

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538562,"June 17, 2016I'm taking a zero day at St Thomas Episcopal Church. I'm very happy to see that the swelling of my left ankle has not gotten any worse. Hopefully icing it down and generally staying off of it for awhile will allow it to heal. The fact that the ankle was getting worse probably had something to do with walking up and down rock filled mountains with a 30 lb. backpack.The good news is my son Tony, who currently lives in The Big Apple, is coming to pick me up tomorrow! Thank you Tony! I plan to spend some much needed zero time with him. Obviously as long as I have any swelling I cannot hike. I won't be posting any entries until I get back to hiking. Thanx to all of you for your prayers of healing and safe passage. PopsBTW- Eating dinner tonite at Paesano's Pizza with Yellow, Toad, and Griz.

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539739,"June 26, 2016My last entry was on June 17th so I am way overdue. In broad strokes I am recuperating in NYC with my son, Tony. I have really enjoyed spending time in Brooklyn with him. Still not sure when I will be back hiking on the AT since my recuperation is not complete yet. My body is on its own schedule! I plan to update everyone with more details soon. In the meantime I thank all of you for your prayers and good wishes.

Pops,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540092,"June 28, 2016Today I am being released from New York Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn. My sprained ankle is much better. However I was admitted to the hospital for an entirely different reason, a seriously infected wound of my left ankle.Over a period of two weeks a minor blood blister developed into a large infected wound. The bacteria that caused the infection is also found in the bite of a Brown Recluse Spider. So it would appear that shortly before I arrived at the Brink Road Shelter on June 12th I had gotten bitten. It became clear at the time of hospital admittance that the infection, if left untreated, could result in losing my left foot. So after 5 days of in-hospital IV antibiotic treatment the danger has passed. I will be traveling back to Atlanta for more convalescence since complete healing of the wound will probably take around 1 month and will also need a skin graft. This is of course a big disappointment but my plan for hiking the AT is still very much alive. I am thinking that I will start early or mid August in Harper's Ferry and hike South to Springer Mtn. This will complete the SOBO leg of the Flip Flop. Obviously at a later date I will finish the northern half of the AT. Again I thank all of you for your prayers and blessings.
