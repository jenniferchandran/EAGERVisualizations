Hangry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503225,"Yes it's done, all the gear is bought! It, like me, is just lazing about waiting for something to happen. I have agonized over every ounce of gear while simultaneously adding pounds to my own body frame; seems counterproductive to me. I have been battling some health issues and as I get them resolved I'll be back working at getting into some sort of shape other than the current round one. I'm already counting down the days to go time, and will be doing some logistical planning while a recover from an upcoming surgery. When I'm being rational I realize I just have to survive long enough to make it to the first resupply, when I'm not being rational the whole world is going to end if I picked the wrong items. If you happen to stumble across me wrapped up in my tent, rocking back and forth, sucking my thumb in the middle of the trail next year be sure to stop and say ""HI""",,View Entry,"Jul 01, Wed",0
Hangry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503438,"To get a SpotGen3 or not is the question. I plan on carrying my cell phone and that will be helpful if I can get reception, but knowing I have health problems it seems like it might be wise to get the SPOT. If people are worried about carrying an extra ounce why would I want to burden others by having them help me off the trail. I'm not doubting that they would help, but I think that I should be able to carry my own weight and be responsible for my own health and well being. I have probably packed and repacked 20 times (here at home) and I'll probably do it a million more times as I use the gear on my practice hikes. So, do I add a SPOT or not?   ",,View Entry,"Jul 02, Thu",0
Hangry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504997,"Now that I have all my gear it’s time to move on to budgeting. But first, let me recap; I’m middle-aged, overweight, and have health problems….so it makes perfect sense to decide to hike 2,200 miles. I have read and researched the cost of this hike and have seen figures like “two bucks a mile”, or, 1,000 per month, and someone else suggested the whole hike could be done for less than 3K. As I think about Hike Your Own Hike (HYOH) and what I want out of my hike these things come to mind to figure in to the budget: I hike like a slug (and I’m ok with that), I want to meet people and see new things, and I have a tendency to get injured. If I’m to have a fighting chance at completing this hike I plan on leaving GA in early March and hiking North until it gets too hot, then come off the trail to travel to Maine and start hiking South. I think this plan gives me the time I need without having to worry about Katahdin closing. Now to figure out the cost of all the off trail travel for a flip flop, food, lodging, a few spa stays….or ER visits, and maybe attempt to squeeze in a quick side trip. I have more time than money, so I had better tighten up my timeline.","
