Walk to Emmaus 
Luk 24:13-32
Luk 24:13 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. 
Luk 24:14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened. 
Luk 24:15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. 
Luk 24:16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. 
Luk 24:17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? 
Luk 24:18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? 
Luk 24:19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: 
Luk 24:20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. 
Luk 24:21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. 
Luk 24:22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; 
Luk 24:23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. 
Luk 24:24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. 
Luk 24:25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: 
Luk 24:26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? 
Luk 24:27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. 
Luk 24:28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. 
Luk 24:29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. 
Luk 24:30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. 
Luk 24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. 
Luk 24:32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
Hopefully he will open my eyes also as in Luke 24.

Emmaus_Walker2016,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/442597,"I was planning on starting my hike next year but due to many changes and unforseen circumstances I will not start now until march of 2016.
also my journal says I'm going north to south but I'm not! I'm planning on going Georgia to Maine.
My family was suppose to have had a family reunion this year but due to financial problems with meany members of my extended family and a lot of roads and damages to the lodges in Colorado from the flooding last year we all agreed to do it next year. I come from a family of 16 brothers and sisters and his will be the first time in our family history to have a chance for all our extended family to be there, (as of right now about 150 people. I have to make it to the reunion and it would fall right in the middle of my hike. I've heard of too many people who quit in the middle and never made it back to the trail. If I start I will continue on and finish it unless God says otherwise. Gives me more time to aquire my gear and train and get in shape.
I thank all that have made comments to me in my quest book on recommendations.
I look forward to maybe seeing each and everyone at some time when I start my trail journey.",,Maine,"Mar 11, Tue",0

I was originally going to start my hike on March 1st 2015 but circumstances have changed and moving it to March 1 2016. Also it says I'm heading southbound on my original entry but I am going to hike NORTHBOUND from Springer Mountain, GA.",,Maine,"Mar 11, Tue",0
