G-Ray 60,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517594,"I am retired from the Air National Guard. Took up hiking back in 2006 when my youngest son was in basic training. I have section hikes the first 106 miles since then. Missed a couple of years because of health problems. I know the odds are against me finishing in Maine , but guess what "" I'll be on the trail in April going north"". I heard the AT was hiring hiker for summer work haha. I've been doing some training hikes here in Alabama. I do walk at work 3 days a week so that helps. That's all for now. G-Ray",,View Entry,"Nov 20, Fri",0

G-Ray 60,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/519470,"Wow what a wild weekend. Had a surprise birthday party for my wife on Saturday. More in a bit, but first my plans in April. Since I have hiked the first 106 miles of the AT in the last few years, I'm going to skip ahead to start at Rock gap shelter. My 12 year old grandson is going with me to start. We will go by Amicalola SP and sign the 2016 register, then drive to rock gap and slack pack the 4 miles to hwy64. Then on Sunday take my pack and head north. Only 83 days to go: but before that I have a wonderful trip to Alaska with my beautiful wife to see the start of the Iditarod. That is what she got for her birthday this weekend. A total surprise for her. This weekend it's a quick trip to the mountains of East Tennessee and Gatlinburg. I can see a trip to the NOC to purchase a couple of thinks in my future. Be safe.

G-Ray 60,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520035,Been home a few days and worked some of them. Weather has been changing a lot. We missed the big snow coming to Gatlinburg and mountains by a week. But as I sit writing this entry it is starting g to snow a little here in central Alabama.

G-Ray 60,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520927,"I work three days a week driving rental cars. So I'm up earlier on those days. Well one morning a week or so ago I woke at about 0430. To early for work. But my mind was not on work it was on my up coming hike. I laid await thinking about the first 106 miles I have hiked. Then I started making myself promises of things I would and wouldn't do when I start. Here are a few:Don't leave the trail on a Rainey day. Or on a cold miserable day. Don't try to do to much in the start. Don't carry to much weight. When you think you might want to quit, remember all the days at work when you said how nice it would be to be on a mountaintop. Do enjoy the views. Do make a new friends. Do enjoy each day for what it bring and the new things you get to do. Embrace the change that comes your way. Be thankful you have someone that understands your desire to do something crazy and stands behind you.So in 46 days I'll stop by Amicalola SP and sign the book, maybe say hello to any NOBO's that are there, then I'll skip north 106 miles and start north. Here's looking forward to meeting lots of new friends.",,Home,"Feb 09, Tue",0

G-Ray 60,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/523383,"Well it's been a month since I made an entry as a lot has been going on. As part of my prep I sent an email to Spot admin for a password reset and to Osprey backpack for a replacement clip. Got a call the next day to reset password and from Osprey to send a replacement clip. They actually sent two of exactly what I needed at no charge. What great customer service from both company's. Then I went on a very fun trip to Alaska with my beautiful wife to the start of the Iditarod 2016. We got to meet several of the musher competing this year to include 4 time champion Jeff King. You may have have seen in the news where two mushers were attacked and one dog will killed early yeasterday. It was Jeff King's dog that was killed. We had a great time there at the banquet, ceremonial start in Anchorage and offical restart on a frozen lake in Willow. Then it was back to New Oleans for my wife to work a company trade show. She was very sick while there we thought from a cold from the frozen lake and cold while there. Little did we know she had type B flu. So it has been a slow weekend for us back here at home. Looks like about 21 days till I go hiking for a while.",,Home,"Mar 13, Sun",0
G-Ray 60,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524216,"After an extra week off from work for me and a week working from home for my wife, we are finally getting over the flu. Glad it came now instead of when I hit the trail in two weeks. Still need to work on food for the start. Weighted the pack at 30-31#s without water. I think it has a couple of days food. Will do some more in detail weighting this week. Following a lot of journals. Seems like the class of 16 is off to a good start. My grandson said last night he will go on Saturday 2 Apr for a day hike with me.. Maybe his Mom also. Till next time. G-ray",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Sun",0

G-Ray 60,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526698,"After almost 4 hours to cover this very short distance I've decided to stop for now. You spend all day looking at where you put each foot especially the weak one, there is no fun in hiking. Also had a lot more is the pack than what I needed. I waited at the picnic area for a while hoping for a ride. Then walked down to the main road and started towards Franklin 13 miles away. After a short road walk I stopped for a break and several cars come up the hill. One stops and ask if I need a ride. I say yes and met Beverly who is a shuttler for the area for donations. Very nice lady carried me to the hotel till I could get a rental car home. I'll be back!!!","Siler Bald Sheltr
