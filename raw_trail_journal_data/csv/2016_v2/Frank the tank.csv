Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/333989,"My plan is to make 4 trips a year on the AT, 2 in the Spring, 2 in the fall. This year because I'm still on active duty I will only make it a short distance. Once I retire each trip is to take a week and cover about 100 miles. I will go from Georgia to Maine and not skip any part of the trail. I hope to finish in 2014. You know what they say about plans. At this point I don't have a clue and my head is full of bad ideas about what I need and how to go about covering this vast distance. I have this crazy notion that I'm going camping. With no true concept of pack weight. I have a 12 dollar 9 pound sleeping bag, a heavy military coat and a 6 pound pack. Total pack weight is 38 lbs. They say that you pack to your fears. If your fear is getting lost you will bring maps, compass, GPS, cell phone, personal locator beacon. Fear of bears, whistle, bear bag equipment, mace, .357 mag. In looking at all the crap I have in my pack my fears must be the fear of freezing to death or starving. I will attempt to provide performance milage data at the end of each section as well as a weather report. I will judge each day as clear or rainy. Snow will be in the rain data. A little rain during a day will not be enough for me to judge the day as rainy.

Drove to Neels Gap last night, spent the night at the Walasi-Yi center.   Early this morning we left Chicken's car in the lot and drove my truck to the top of Springer Mt on Forrest Service Rd 42. I had to stop and buy a local map at a gas station. This road is not well marked. It is a dirt road that is in good shape, it has regular type cars in the parking lot the top. We started south a mile to the top of the mountain for the required photos at the brass plaque, then headed north. Stopped for lunch at Stover Creek Shelter. Someone left behind an inflatable sleeping pad, a metal coffee pot. I took the sleeping pad. Well before dark we made it to horse gap. Because of all the winter rains there was a small spring a few hundred yards to the left down the hill. I cooked up half of the one pound Kilbasa that I carried. I kept thinking about bears all night long with that other half of the Kilbasa in my food bag in my tent. Who needs bear bags?  [Clark] May 21st 1804 all the forepart of the day arranging our party and procuring the different articles necessary for them at this place.

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/334025,"Day 2, Slept like a baby, cried for an hour, quiet for an hour etc. It was a warm night for mid-April. Nice and sunny all day long. Climbing these hills is a battle. With this pack weight I have trouble walking thru the big up hill sections and must stop to get my breath every 100 yards.   It took all day to make it 10.8 miles. We camped on a ridge .9 miles north of Woody Gap. I start looking at all the crap I have been lugging up and down all these hills.   I have carried this huge sleeping bag and heavy military coat, I have heavy metal cookware and a big metal cup, Chicken has a 3 pound hatched. I feel like the bull in the bullfight that had to spend half an hour being chased around then taking on a 2 thousand pound armored horse and a guy with a pick....then they bring out the matador. The price for lugging all this stuff is you can't go very far and you are wore out at the end of the day. At this point if I were a thru-hiker, I would be having grave doubts. For me this is a 3 day trip. Time to bury the hatchet, and we did, deep in an old stump along with a bunch of other items including food, clothing, etc. That heavy military coat at least burned well! I do, highly resolve, to: LIGHTEN THIS LOAD TO THE MINIMUM ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO HIKE THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL  (Lewis) Monday September 17th 1804 Having for many days past confined myself to the boat, I determined to devote this day to amuse myself on shore with my gun and view the interior of the country lying between the river and the Corvus Creek.","Horse Gap

The climb up Blood Mt was easier then I thought it would be. SOBO's will have a much rougher climb than NOBO's. The outfitter store here is not shy about charging very high prices. We picked up the car and drove back to Springer for my truck. This was a 3 day trip that covered 30.7 miles for a average of 10.2 miles per day.

This is a 5 day continuation of a trip I started this Spring.   Today we dropped my truck off in Deep Gap NC which is about 7 miles north of the GA/NC state line. Then we drove my friends truck back to Neel's Gap. We started hiking about 2pm.   It was dark when we arrived at the Whitley Shelter which is located so far off the A.T. that I don't see how it qualifies as a A.T. shelter. We cooked dinner on my new home-made forced air wood stove. It's made from a metal paint can. By drilling a dozen 1 inch holes it lets the air in when you light it.    4 pine cones and a handful of pencil sized sticks represent a fuel load. Once the pine cones get burning you attach a 3 foot cord to the handle of the paint can then spin it rapidly around your head. This forces huge amounts of air into the fire and after perhaps 45 seconds of pumping it turns into quite a flame thrower. I then add a bit more fuel, spin it a few more times then set it down. It will boil water faster than a gas stove. It is generating a large amount of BTU's. It adds a bit of drama to the end of the day, as the other hikers scatter.   If the cord ever breaks this thing will fly down the ridge and start a forrest fire.

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/334220,"Hiking Day 5, Clear and warm. Up and down all day. I got up at first light and found 2 bears attempting to get at the food bags hanging on the cables. They took one look at me and ran away. I know I look pretty bad in the morning, I guess that confirms it. One good thing about the ""puds"" is that the trail brings you to lot's of good water even in the dry season. I have not yet treated or filtered any of the water. Once I'm into Virginia that will change. Curtis encountered 2 or 3 very black wild hogs who high-tailed it when they saw him coming up the trail. Found a homeless guy living in Blue Mountain Shelter. He told me that he only lives here the last 2 weeks of the month. He goes into Helen GA on the first to get his tiny VA check. He lives under a bridge there until he drinks up his check, then it's back to one of the nearby A.T. shelters. He cleans up the area around the shelter, sweeps it clean, brings in firewood and tells his tale of woe to all the hikers, some of whom give him his daily bread. I met 2 ladies on the trail who warned me about him, they said that even though he did not do anything wrong, he ""creeped"" them out a bit, and they moved on rather then spend the night there. We continued north down into Unicoi Gap with hopes of finding a campsite at the bottom. No such luck, My friend Curtis who is younger, stronger, faster climbed up the A.T. hoping to find a suitable campsite. Little did I know that it would be more than half way up before a flat spot suitable for a campsite could be found. I used up all my swear words that last half hour. Curtis had a fire going by the time I got there. I have never met someone as good at fire-starting as Curtis. 5 minutes and he's got it going.    One thing I like about remote campsites, good firewood.

Passed a retired Navy Master Chief and his wife headed south that had once been assigned to the same little Navy Squadron. VS-29 in San Diego. Had quite a little gam. ie. Chatted Navy talk for a while. Small world. We could see where the wild hogs had rooted up a huge area. It looked like some had worked the ground with farming equipment in the woods on both sides of the AT. We were attacked by a swarm of yellow jackets and each of us got stung twice. For some reason bees and wasps go a little crazy in the fall when freezing weather first hits. We outdistanced them by running a quarter of a mile. We camped on a ridge line a few feet off the trail above the spring. Plenty of fire wood.

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/334378,"Hiking Day #7, 62.1 miles from Springer, cool and light rain most of the day. Clouds obscured all views today. At a gap near the road we ran into a runner who was on the final stages of finishing his thru-run of the Appalachian Trail. He had started in Maine 2 months ago. They had a truck and a motorhome. When we came up the hill he was setting in a folding chair eating a sandwich with each foot in a bucket and was attended to by 3 people. This was his pit-crew. They gave us some water. Then they were off to the next gap. They had it all planned out. He was doing 40 or more miles per day and sleeping in the motorhome. He carried a bottle of water. He was attempting to break the record but was going to fail. In Maine he developed a foot infection called jungle rot caused by a bacteria. They mis-diagnosed the condition as poison ivy and treated him with Prednisone when he needed a massive dose of Penicillin. He had to be hospitalized for fear of amputation. That put him off the trail long enough to prevent him from setting the record.   He said that he did not run 100% of the time and that he walked across boulder fields and on the steep part of the uphills.

Easy day today because my truck is parked only 7 miles away, if it's still there. Only 3 of us at the Bly Gap campsite last night. This is a well used campsite and finding firewood took a bit of effort. We went past that landmark of a tree that you see in just about every AT video, it's bent over and looks like a sitting elk.   I have noticed that most of the half dozen or so gaps on the AT named ""Deep Gap"", are in fact aptly named. This one in North Carolina is just that. My truck was just fine and we made it back to the starting point at Neels Gap to pick up the other truck. A recent hurricane disrupted the distribution of Gasoline and we had to drive around Georgia looking for a open gas station. Made it home to Tennessee by dark. I will start back where we left the trail in the Spring. This section of the trail was 52.6 miles and it took 5 days for a 10.5 mile per day average. Total Appalachian Trail milage is 83.3 miles in 8 days for a 10.4 average. The weather was clear all 5 days for 100%.

My daily average was about 10.3 miles per day. Now that I have more experience that daily average needs improvement.   I retired from the Navy 3 months ago. My plan is to make it 400 miles this year. We left an Air Force buddy's truck at the NOC, he will hike with me for the first few days. Then we drove to the AT in Deep Gap. We left a box of trail magic in the form of fruit and orange juice at the trailhead. We had a easy climb up and over Standing Indian Mt. and passed a few exhausted souls on the way up. We made camp a few yards from Betty's Creek next to an fellow Navy guy named Purdue who had recently left the service. He was an Aviation Ordnanceman 1st Class and had served on a couple of the Carriers that I was on. This year I plan to use my homemade spinning wood stove to do all my cooking. In rainy weather I have to come up with enough dry wood or pinecones throughout the day to make a fire without carving away chunks of benches and shelters. No problem today, plenty of firewood everywhere. [Clark] 18th August 1804. a fine morning.

It looked like he was more of an actual hiker because he had equipment. Curtis, my hiking buddy got a little damp this morning in a rain storm and even though it was in the 60's he got quite a chill. He could talk ok and his teeth were not chattering but his hands would not work. He could hardly hold the coffee cup at lunch. I gave him my extra lightweight windbreaker and within an hour hiking up Albert Mt. he was fine. No views today. We could not see 50 feet in the clouds. Camped on a flat spot just short of the shelter. A lady camped near us in a hammock tent. It's the first one I've seen in use. She said it's comfortable but looks heavy and cold. It rained overnight and Curtis experienced some rain-splash but I was dry in the exact same type tent. Defferent angle to the wind, I guess. [Clark] 22nd August 1804 at three miles we landed at a bluff where the 2 men sent with the horses were waiting with two deer, by examonation this bluff contained Alum, Copperas, Cobalt, Pyrites, a Alum Rock soft & sand stone.

The trees have small leaves in the lower elevations, only buds in the high country. Bad foot day today, I have light weight Merrell's and my feet get wet just walking in damp grass. Much of the day was like walking in a stream. No views from the Wayah Bald tower. At the shelter just past the bald we stopped to cook up some lunch. There was a young lady from San Francisco zeroing for the day who said she twisted her foot. We pressed on through the rain all afternoon and camped on a little hill above the shelter. There were close to 30 people camped here. Curtis got a fire going in the rain again. Amazing.

I used the tried and true method of loading up everything possible while seated in the tent, thank goodness for headspace. Then I jumped out in my rain gear and pulled up stakes, then in one motion flipped the entire tent over so the bottom was on facing up. Then it was a matter of removing the brace poles and quickly folding the tent. Not perfect but the tent is dry. It was an easy walk to the NOC, attempted to find the Rufus Morgan shelter for no real reason other than ""I have heard that it is hard to find"". No signs anywhere, near where the map said that it was. Went back once, gave up. No sign and no shelter, it's a mystery. Had a big breakfast at the NOC then jumped in Curtis's truck for the drive back to Deep Gap NC to pick up my truck then drove to Newfound Gap in the GSMNP to park my truck. It was a blinding rainstorm at the gap. No activity what so ever at the parking lot which is usually ""circus like"". Picked up a forlorn looking, drenched thru-hiker and took him to a Cherokee NC hotel. Then it was back to drop me off at the NOC and said good-by to Curtis.

The coke machine was broke but the phone for the 3 dollar shuttle was in operation. He took me to Fontana Village. I hoped for a better re-supply store. I managed to get enough food to make it to Newfound Gap. Met a Highland Scot at the coffee shop named Neil McKenzie who had thru-hiked some years before. He had hiked some of the more famous trails in Europe. I purchased a package of hot dogs and some flat bread to act as a bun and took the shuttle back to the marina. It's a bit more than a mile's hike from there to the dam and the shelter. Very nice shelter overlooking the lake. The backcountry permit for the GSMNP is available at the dam but it's not easy to find. Look for the coke machine. Very poor directions on how to fill the thing out. Most hikers(not counting thru-hikers) need 2 things to travel the AT in this park, 1- a backcountry permit, 2-a reservation for the shelters and campgrounds. The reservation can be made via the telephone if you call early enough ahead of time(like a month). None of the thru hikers I ran into had a reservation. Even though they don't tell you to on the directions for the backcountry permit you should just write ""Thru-Hiker"". You take one copy of the permit and stuff the other in the box provided. From looking at the number of copy's stuffed in the box they don't pick these things up very often. There was about 15 people at the shelter. Someone else shared the beer and I shared the hot dogs.

The storm hit just as I got to the dam so I waited out the lightening under the cover of the closed gift shop for half an hour. Then I crossed the most expensive quarter mile of the Appalachian Trail and started up the long climb of the Shuckstack. The howling wind driven rain made it fun. I wrapped duct tape around my hood and hat to keep them on my head. The trail is on the ridge line and the strong winds coming up the hill forced the rain to go up as opposed to down. The wind, rain and lightening just kept going all morning. I made to to the Mollies Ridge shelter for lunch. Someone had erected a tarp windbreak at the shelter. The wind made so much noise that normal volume conversation was not possible. I cooked a hot meal of oatmeal mixed with trail mix and hot coffee.   I pressed on. I thought about stopping at Russell Field Shelter but it was empty, cold and depressing looking with that chain link fence in front so I kept going arriving at the Spence Field Shelter at dark.

I stopped for lunch at Derrick Knob Shelter. They have no Privy, just a shovel. The ""designated bathroom area"" looked like prairie dog town with hundreds of little holes. Not very sanitary. In this park they force you to use the shelters, so it concentrates the hikers. They need to build some privies.

Double Spring Shelter was like an island, you almost needed a boat to get out of the shelter. The worst of the lightening hit as I passed Clingman's dome. It was air to ground and nearby. The ground shook with every flash. It was like being under an artillery barrage. I hid under an upturned root ball from a giant pine tree that had beed knocked over in years past. I waited it out for about 45 minutes soaked to the bone. As I passed Mt. Collins and started down into Newfound Gap I could have made short work of it if I had my kayak. The trail was all whitewater. The weather had cleared by the time I made it to the Gap where I found the Japanese student waiting for the ride I previously offered in my truck to Gatlinburg.

Because the park service charges money for private taxi services to come into the park the shuttle operators charge more. So I had the shuttle operator drop me off at the park entrance. It took under a minute to thumb down a ride and started hiking at 11am. It was an easy climb up the well graded trail. I met dozens of day hikers heading to Charlie's Bunion. I had my sub-sandwich for lunch at Ice-water spring shelter. Someone had abandoned a thick sleeping pad, it weighed too much for me to carry on to the next shelter but I thought about it. With all the fall colors fully engaged at this altitude it was stunning. I chased a young bear out of a low hanging tree branch and he bounded down the hill. When I arrived at the shelter there were 2 other recent retirees just hiking the park. This shelter also has a resident African Ginny-fowl, very tame begging food from all the campers.

The view to the south of the National Park is really something. While at Max Patch there were dozens of other hikers. I also encountered 4-wheelers using the AT, teenagers on the loose. It looks like the trail maintainers enable them by cutting through the big deadfall trees that fall across the AT each winter with wide cuts of perhaps 6 feet. If they cut only a 2 foot gap the 4-wheelers could not fit through and the trail would be open for hikers. I arrived at the Walnut Mt. Shelter at sunset. It had a very poor water supply. It took half an hour to collect enough water for supper. When the sun set the temp dropped into the 40's. I was alone in the shelter and made a huge Jeramia Johnson fire right in front of the shelter. The tiny shelter was heated by the fire.","Standing Bear Hostel

It was an easy hike up and over Bluff Mt. Of course my pack weight must be down to the mid teens with no food to carry. It's all a big 4-wheeler trail up and over the ridges. I met a bear hunter pulling a little homemade trailer behind his 4-wheeler, putting out his baits and scouting for the upcoming season looking for bear sign. I stopped for lunch at the Deer Park Mt. shelter. This was a former homestead many years ago and you can still make out foundations and there is a small graveyard. This must have been a tough way to make a living. How these folks got to town back then must have been a hard trip. I made it into Hot Springs by 2pm and came out to a paved road and with no signs or white blaze, I promptly turned right instead of left and hiked up the wrong way for half a mile. I noticed that the town was getting thinner and turned around. Why don't they have a sign right where the trail comes out? It's a mystery. I found my truck still intact and drove home.

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/335551,"Hiking day # 23, 298.2 miles north of Springer. All day rain. Hiked with a young Marine today who had participated in battle during the invasion of Iraq. His pack weight must have been 60 pounds. We had lunch together at Little Laurel shelter where I noticed the plastic garbage bag hanging on the bear cables. It was trail magic candy bars and some noodles. Later in the afternoon I came to a blue blaze trail called bad weather trail near Big firescald knob. This bad weather trail, which I did not take, is a bypass for a very rough 2 miles of boulder skipping, rock to rock jumping nasty trail along a very exposed ridge. The weather had cleared a little bit and I was able to enjoy a fantastic view of the brilliant fall colors from this ridge. In bad weather I recommend the by-pass. This ridge trail reminded me of climbing out on the long rock jetty at the mouth of the St. Johns River in Jacksonville. I ran into 2 teenager bear hunters on foot, with 2 way radios and a rifle. They were attempting to locate the pack of dogs that I had been hearing most of the day. They explained how they went about shooting a bear. Early in the morning the older members of the family would walk the dogs along the roads that go through the gaps in the mountains hoping that the dogs would detect the recent passing of a bear. When the dogs behaved in such a way indicating that a bear came through recently the men would turn all the dogs loose chasing the bear, and the hunters would go have coffee at the truck.   Because the hunters have good knowledge of area and the dogs each had a radio locator device attached to the collars they could monitor the dogs location. After an hour or so the bear will start to slow down and stop frequently. This slowing down is monitored by the hunters in the truck and the location is pin-pointed. The teenagers are then dispatched on 4-wheelers with the 2-way radios. When they get close they wait until they hear on the radio, or if they are close enough to hear the dogs, that the bear is either in a tree or otherwise brought to bay so they can move in on foot with the gun. Then they decide if this an adult bear big enough to shoot. If it's too small they have to drag most of the dogs well away from the bear and tie them up, sometimes one at a time because it's difficult to get a bear dog to give up on a bear. In all, it's a very expensive way to hunt. 4-wheelers, trucks, radio equipment, dog food, vet bills, gas. The money for them is not in the bear itself, it's in the dogs which they breed and train. They sell the trained bear dogs for thousands of dollars. There is also money from rich guys who pay big money to outfitters who let the ""hunter"" follow the teenagers on the 4-wheelers and he is the one who pulls the trigger.   I did not hear any shots today so perhaps the bear was too small or he got away. I arrived at the shelter just before dark. There were 2 other hikers there for the night, a grumpy postal worker and the young Marine. About midnight we were joined by a lost bear dog, radio collar and all.","Spring Mt Shelter

The bear dogs name was #37, it said so on his radio collar and he followed the Marine and I north. We stopped for lunch at the Flint Mt Shelter. #37 did not much like hiker food and refused crackers and gorp. His owner according to the tag was ""Berry"" and his phone number was printed on the collar. I gave him a call and agreed to meet up in a couple hours at Devil Fork gap where the road crossed.

This was the first long road walk of the AT and involves the area where the trail crosses I-77 and the spot where US-52 goes to Bland or Bastain Va.   It seemed like 3 or 4 miles of road. I ran into 3 south bound thru-hikers who spent the night in a small shed behind an abandoned building. It's next to the trail across from a big white church. The north end of the road walk where the AT peels off to the right into the woods is poorly marked and I made a left instead of a right. From looking at the wear of the pathway many others have made this wrong turn. I stopped for lunch at Helvey's Mill Shelter and about broke my neck attempting to get water from the almost dry creek way down the hill.   The rest of the afternoon was a big waterless ridge walk. I was glad that I had loaded up with water because Jenny Knob shelter was totally dry. There were 2 SOBO's at the shelter who set up there cool new tent in the shelter for no reason other than to see how it looked. They had tent trouble in the Shanny's and had just picked up the new tent in Pearisburg.","Laurel Creek Campsite

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/336581,"Hiking Day #42, Clear and dry all day. I got up early and had a little dirty creek water for breakfast. After a few miles I came to a road where I found house that had a little sign indicating that I could get water out of a nearby hose. It tasted a bit like rotten eggs but it was clean. I found plenty of water all afternoon as I got to the Dismal Swamp creeks watershed. I passed up on the falls and went to the Wapiti Shelter for lunch. Finally a shelter with a good water supply. It was Heratio at the bridge for about 5 minutes when I encountered a large black snake in the middle of a bridge. I would have had to get wet to get around it. So I got a long stick and did battle. It took him a while to figure out that I was any kind of threat at all. He eventually got the idea and jumped in the creek and made his get away. I had great views this afternoon on the climb up the huge ridge that is just north of Wapiti Shelter. The ridge itself is a tough walk because of the jagged and loose rocks for several miles on the trail itself. I made it to Woods Hole right before dark and found it crowded with leaf peeping car hikers. These are people from all over the east to come here each fall to see the fall colors and this was the prime of it. I was lucky to get a place to sleep. The main house at the hostel is a converted farm from back in the 1800's and made of American Chestnut logs. It reminded me of a hippie commune from the 60's. The food was great.","Jenny Knob Shelter

I passed on the offer of a ride to the top of the hill where the AT starts and walked. Nice and easy hike today along a huge ridge with great views. No big hills to climb. After such a big breakfast I decided to skip lunch and press on into town. I met a couple headed south who had to be in their 80's. They had just made the monster climb up from Pearisburg and were headed to the Woods hole hostel. She had a fall the day before and did a head-plant. She was looking like a sailor after a bar fight but was moving right along. The last 3 miles is down a very steep grade. I met a SOBO from Australia who was not enjoying the climb. The problem for me is that I know on the other side of the river I will have a similar climb when I resume my hike in the Spring. I went directly to Hardies for lunch and waited for the shuttle operator who took me back to the Red Barn and my truck for the long drive home.   On this section of the trail I hiked 87.8 miles in 5 days for a per day average of 17.6 For the entire trail up to now I have hiked 626.4 miles in 43 days for an average of 14.6.

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350608,"Hiking Day #44 warm and clear. April 17 and the trees above 2000 feet have only buds. Down in the valleys they are half way leaved out. This is the first day of the 2011 Spring season. I left my truck in front of the outfitter store in Daleville where I hope to be in about 6 days and caught a ride back to Pearisburg yesterday afternoon. After spending the night at the hikers hostle I started my hike in the same Hardie's that I ended at last Fall. The first mile is a road walk to the bridge that took me over the New River Narrows a few miles from the West Virginia border. Yesterday's weather in this section of Virginia was pretty horrid with tornados and a half foot of rain. This caused flooding in all the small creeks and I had to build 2 bridges and walk through several raging torrents just to get to ridge line. Nothing like starting the day wet with a 2,000 foot climb. I stopped for lunch at Symms Gap Meadow and dried out my socks. This ridge line has excellent views of the valley's below including some sort of nasty factory/mining chemical operation that produces acetate. The people in town say that they don't mind the odor. It smells like money. Money for who? As poor and shabby as that town is, not much money is landing there. Smells more like stupid. I passed 2 young guys on their very first Appalachian Trail hike. They said they were headed North to Harpers Ferry and planned to be there in 2 weeks. I did not say a word. It's a bit less than 400 miles from here and unless I'm missing something from the looks of these two and the massive amount of equipment, I'm thinking that it will involve some hitchiking for them to make it that far in 2 weeks. I wished them luck and pressed on. I was the first to arrive at the shelter about supper time and gathered up some firewood. It is suprising how fast the woods will dry in the hot sun 24 hours after rain. 2 guys from Montana arrived just befor dark. Twin brothers about 60 years old on a thru hike. They started in February and had slugged through the deep snow in the Smokies. Most of the mob of thru-hikers headed North are well South of me at this time.","Pearisburg Va

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350765,"Hiking Day #45, Clear and warm. Getting up and getting on the trail always takes too much time. I will be attempting to come up with a system that will get me packed, loaded, fed and on my way in 30 minutes. With others who are late sleepers in the shelter adds to the problem as I don't want to make too much noise. My little gas stove sounds like a jet engine. One of the things that does work well is to get ready to depart the night before with a set up that will allow me to get at the cooking equipment quickly so I can pack up while the water is heating. If the shelter is full of late sleepers I sometimes just depart without cooking and hold off eating for an hour or two. When I do that I'm gone in 10 minutes. I had a real easy day today at a little less than 13 miles with only 1 decent climb. As I passed a tree not 5 feet away I caught sight of a black snake out of the corner of my eye. It was like someone had glued him to the tree. I'm not a big fan of snakes to put it mildly so I won't even get close to take a picture. This thing has to be 5 feet long. There is alot of farm country in this section of the trail. I got to the shelter first, gathered firewood and had a fire going by the time that 3 others showed up.","Pine Swamp Branch Shelter

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350884,"Hiking Day #46, Clear and warm. Long dry ridge walk today. I had lunch next to a giant oak tree called the Keefer Oak it is one of biggest and oldest oaks in the US. It's a wonder that nobody chopped it down. Lunch on this trip is tortillia flat bread with bacon chunks that they sell in the salad section of the grocery and pre sliced pepperoni, I add some parmasian cheese from little packets I got from Pizzia Hut and some picanti sauce also from little packets. None of this needs much refridgeration and will last a week. I made the mistake of climbing the ridgline North of the Keefer Oak with only 1 20oz bottle of water. Water has been so easy to find because of the recent rains I became complacent. It was a long, hot and dry afternoon and I did not find water for 7 miles. Of course there is plenty of water nearby, 2 or 3 thousand feet below in the valley. I carry as my water supply 2 20oz coke bottles for water. I have a third empty bottle in case I get to a section where I need a little extra. I carry an empty half gallon milk jug tied to my pack for camp water.

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350980,"Hiking Day #47, clear and warm. Another easy day on the trail. I was up and gone in 25 minutes. The trail drops a thousand feet to more cow pastures then climbs a long ridgeline that is great for hiking because the path is improved to provide access by veteran groups to the Audi Murphy monument. Some group from his home state of Texas made a monument at the place near where he was killed in a plane crash in the 60's. The army gave him a bunch of medals for his heroics in Europe during WW-II and Hollywood cashed in and put him as the star of dozens of ""B"" movies in the late 40's and 50's. The vetrans have made this a pilgrimage site with some nice benches to sit on and enjoy the splended views of the valley below. They could use a picnic table. It's clear from the Texas flag and the well groomed landscaping that they have some doings here mabe on the 4th of July or Memorial Day or perhaps Vetrans Day. Many of these Virginia ridges are rough hiking because of all the exposed rocks and bolders. Not this one, it's a nice soft grass tredway and it's easy to make good miles here. After lunch at the Pickle Branch shelter I climbed the next ridgline which is not easy. This ridge is the result of a violent collision of Africa and North America about 200 million years ago that allowed the newer rock to overlap and push up over the older rock forming a formation called dragons teeth rigde. Some of the giant elongated stones go up virtical forming the dragons tooth. The Appalachian Trail North bound is an fairly easy climb but a wicked decent on the other side. Hand holds and foot pegs are in place to make it doable. This is as close to rock climbing that the trail has. Later in the day I came out to a road that has a nearby convenience store that makes pizzia and has hot food. I did a re-supply here before plodding up the road a half mile to the just re-opened 4 pines Hostel. By just re-opened, I mean, as in I was the first customer in about 6 years. I helped sweep out the garrage of Elpaca droppings. Nobody else was there, just the owner.","Niday Shelter

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/351090,"Hiking Day #48, clear and warm. Departed the hostel just after first light. The day started with a short climb and a very plesant ridge walk of 5 miles. When I got to the road crossing at VA 311 I cut through the parking lot and by doing do so, I later found out, I missed the cooler of free soda and food that was put out as trail magic. Note to self...stay on the path, dummy. It was a very easy climb up to McAfee's Knob. I stopped for lunch at Catawba Mt Shelter. This area of the trail is so busy with hikers that they have built 2 shelters a mile or so apart. When I got to the top there were plenty of day hikers to take the obligitory phots with dangling feet. I encountered 3 groups of boy scouts today. I stocked up on water for the big ridgwalk over the tinker cliffs. The trail follows along the very edge of these high cilffs for a mile or two and offers quite a view. I arrived at the shelter well before dark. There were 3 others already sleeping as I was getting ready for bed when we herd sombody singing loudly. Along comes this young man, a thru-hiker I had met a few days before, LOLO. It seems that he encountered a bear up on the cliffs that ran off but he sensed was following him and he started singing in an attempt to scare off the bear. I told him that we normally make noise so that a bear might hear us well in advance of our arrival so that it can keep away from us and not be suprised by our sudden appearance. Once he knows you are there singing won't do much good if the bear is intent on following you. This kid then set out some of his equipment and decides to cook in the shelter as opposed to the picnic table 5 yards away. He has one of those little alcohol stoves and while lighting it, he dumps it over and starts a fire on the floor of the shelter between 2 sleeping hikers. Everyone scrambles up and I throw the kid a water bottle and tell him to dump it on the fire. He does not want to make a mess and holds off a few seconds. Thats when the fire burns thru his un-noticed bic lighter and it explodes in 3 directions and his hair briefly catches on fire. He ended up with a few minor burns and some burn spots on some equipment. We were all lucky that he had put his plastic fuel bottle behind him before lighting the stove. I guess there are a few lessons here, like ""don't cook in the shelter"" or ""when you have a chance to put out the fire, do it now"".","4 Pines hostel VA 624

Everyone at the shelter seemed in good spirits considering the near disaster last night. I ran in to the boy scouts encamped in a meadow a half mile below the shelter. I rested up there and got water and because of a light wind that made the tree branches rub together making squeeking sounds, I told those gathered a tall tail about the ""wild tree squeeks"" that make that noise. I went on for some time about how you need to gather up all your things and put them in the tent as these wild tree squeeks like to steal your stuff and play pranks on children. I kept it up for quite a while. They seemed to enjoy the story. I went past massive clumps of blooming rhododendrum, which I'm sure to have mis-spelled and possibly mis-identified. Like Mark Twain said, ""it's a weak mind that can only think of one way to spell a word"". It was an easy and short hike today. My pack weight less than 18 pounds with zero in the food bag. The trail runs along a 161 KV power transmission line that was making snap crackle and pop sounds in the morning dew. You don't suppose it has anything with the ""Virginia crackle birds"" do ya. They make thier nests high in the towers of electrical power lines and make those sounds to scare you off. Moving right along...The trail runs a ridgline above a lake for severial miles before decending into town just a few hundred yards to several fast food places and a Kroeger store.

I had delayed re-starting the second part of my Spring trip a couple days because of the bad weather. 2 Days prior a group of tornados went through Southern Virginia and I passed by a wrecked area next to I-81 as I headed North. I would not want to be tenting during one of those. Despite my efforts I was unable to find a shuttle operator in the area I was hiking so I just drove to the spot where I left the trail parked the truck and started hiking a little after noon. Just how I will get back here is anyones guess. This day's hike went rather well, the trail crosses I-81 again and heads up a ridgline. Because of the previous days rain there was plenty of water. I hiked with Deliware Dave for a while, he is a thru-hiker whom I read about in Trail Journals because he was trapped in a shelter in the Smokies with White Wolf for 2 days in a snow storm and White Wolf wrote about it. He would be heading home for a week so he could vacation with his friends on there yearly camping trip on the Appalachian Trail at the Deliware Water Gap in Pa. Interrupting a thru-hike on the AT so you can vacation on the AT! That is not what I would do. I made it to the shelter well before dark. It was quite full of thru-hikers and because I could hear the distant rumble of thunder I took my time picking a place to put up the tent. The trick is to avoid areas near dead trees or trees with dead limbs.

I blasted out of there with a 2.5 mile pace figuring to cook breakfast at the next shelter. I stopped at the Bobblets Gap Shelter to make coffee and make some oatmeal. The sun was out and I was able to dry out my tent some with a half hour of direct sunlight. The trail ran along the same ridge with the BRP(Blue Ridge Parkway) for most of the day. Some nice lady was handing out free soda at one of the parking turnouts. It was easy walking with great views all afternoon and I stopped about 1:30 for lunch at Cove Mtn Shelter which has no water. It used to have water 30 years ago when they built it. Not too many people want to stay in waterless shelters. Now with global warming it has all dried up. It won't be long before this area will be in the heart of the desert Southeast. There is nothing like a nice thousand foot climb up a mountain late in the afternoon. I made it up and over Floyd Mtn as darkness was falling. There was one hiker at the shelter. He was a preacher from Leadville Colorado a few years younger than me and he could not believe that I started out the day over 25 miles away. He was on a 8 mile per day pace.

The trail today was easy because I did the heavy climbing yesterday and the trail follows a high ridgline for many miles past a huge FAA radar tower that was once a USAF NORAD early warning radar site during the cold war. It now operates on remote control so other than maintenance visits the place is deserted. The trail then makes a big drop under a large rock that is jammed in a crack called the gillotine. The few people I encountered today were 2 local day hikers climbing up the hill at a slow pace and 2 ladies at a shelter near the James River. I got a little wet crossing the creek in front of that shelter. The ladies said that the local trail club removed the little bridge that would have kept me dry. They removed the brige because they thought it unsightly when viewed from the shelter. I wish thay would have left it up. They are the same people who have removed almost all of the white blazes in this area. I always thought the white blazes were there to keep hikers not familiar with the area from getting lost. I guess the people in charge, favor those who are familiar with the trail...like themselves. After that I was wondering if I was going to have to swim the James.

This kid is probably a relative of my wife, same name, same area of Virginia. Later in the day I came through the now extinct town of Brown Mtn. The town came into existance after the Civil War as a place for local freed slaves to live as sharecroppers. They farmed the tiny valley next to the creek. It's hard to see because of all the trees that grow here now. Some of the stone foundations remain as well as the work they did to shore up the creek to prevent flooding. This must have been tough mountain farming from the look of the terain. The state has preserved this area and put up informational signs and benches to rest on at various places on the trail.

We underestimated how long it would take to climb up the other side gap and darkness fell about 2 miles from the shelter. The climb was long and very steep.

There was one hiker in the shelter. We cooked up a fine meal and then each had a small 1oz bottle of Scotch for medicinal purpose only. Well after hiker midnight another group of tenters showed up a few hundred yards away and decided to chop wood with the double bladed axe they brought along and we all had to put up with chopping sounds well into the night.

I got up early at the Colony house motel, made breakfast and walked the quarter mile back to the trail in the dark. The thru-hkers companion has the distance wrong to this motel. They say one mile. It is about a quarter mile. There is no where to eat near here so stock up. The motel does sell a small amount of geedunk like candy bars etc. Within a mile of the little stand where you pick up the back-country permit I ran into bear #6, he stood there 60 yards away and I took his picture. The trail in this area is poorly blazed and with many unmarked cross trails it's easy to end up off trail. One thing I do like about the park is the concrete sign posts with actual useful information for hikers. The information is stamped on metal bands that wrap around the top of the post. It helps to make up for skimping on white paint. One of the confusions with this section of the trail is that a shelter is not a shelter except when it is.    After 900 miles on the trail I have come to recognize a shelter when I see one. The rules as posted at the entrance to the park is that you can't sleep at a shelter. You can only sleep at a hut. They both look exactly the same. So the very first shelter you come to has a sign that say's you can sleep there. I came to find out there were other shelters that were huts, like Bird's nest #3 shelter which is a hut. To make it even more confusing they have the Tom Floyd Wayside. It's the only Wayside that does not sell food, it does not sell anything because it's a shelter that you can sleep at. Consistency is not the PATC's strong suit. When you get busted by the trail cops, I guess you have a built in excuse. I was confused officer! I have seen quite a few other hikers today. I met a South bound thru-hiker who was a retired fireman from Indiana. I gave him a giant sara-lee blueberry muffin that I had left over from the motel re-stock. I ran into bears #7 and 8 about noon. It's odd to see bears walking around at mid-day.   The deer are also odd. One walked right up to me like she was looking for a muffin or something. The ones I hunt for in the fall don't act like this. If they ever open the park for hunting, these deer won't last long. I did have trouble locating water today and I drank from a mud puddle in the afternoon. I made it to Black rock shelter or hut that is, as the sun was setting. This time in October gives you about 11 hours of daylight. The shelter was full of car campers from the road below, so I camped on a very nice and soft flat spot 200 yards away.

My wife's is decendant from the Via family. They were French Hugonauts who came to America as a group in the early 1600's to land granted by the English King. The English had accepted these immigrants from France because, at the time they fancied themselves as a haven for protestants being persicuted on the continent. They then decided to grant them passage to the New World as a way to populate North America with protestants. So they were given a huge tract land near Richmond. They were given a recently abandoned Indian village that they called Manikintown. Some of them ended up owning huge tracts of land in what is now the SNP because it was hard to farm and full of wild beasts and sometimes hostile natives. 2 miles east of the Blackrock hut is Via gap, which was a small settelment with a school and church and several Via family's homesteads when the State of Virginia forced them to sell the land to make the Park. The head of the family, Christopher Columbus Via, decided to fight it all the way to the US Suprime Court, which did not rule in there favor. The Via family had always been poor. Right up until the passage of the 18th ammendment of the constitution. They made a small income from the numerous apple orchards. With the high price of outlaw apple brandy, all of a sudden, they had some money. Most of the big fight to keep the park and the AT out back in the 30's was about the money in bootleg booze. The orange blazed trail down into the gap is across from the Skyline Drive parking lot North of Black Rock. The decendants of Christopher Columbus Via have cleared out the overgrowth around the cemetery. After taking a few photos I then hiked down the valley past the ruins of the one room Via school to the place where the Church of the Bretherin once stood then took the park service road back up to Skyline Drive. The entire trip added about 8 miles to my day. I was back on the trail by noon. I made it to the shelter about 2 hours after dark. The bright full moon and easy trail made it quite pleasant. I encountered bears #9 and #10 as it was getting real dark. They were in the trail 30 yards away and after looking at me for a few minutes the cooly ambled down the hill. The shelter had 5 overnight campers from New York City who seemed out of place in the woods.","Blackrock shelter

I parked in front of the NPS visitors center. I did go inside and fill out a form so I could leave the truck parked there. Then I called a shutte operator and for a hundred dollars he drove me South back to Swift Run Gap where I spent the night in a motel near the park. As today is to be a short day, I slept in a bit and the owner gave me a lift back to the Park entrance. I filled out another backcountry camping permit. It was more of the easy hiking with few climbs of any kind. I ran into a South bound thru hiker and gave him a Sara-lee blueberry muffin that I had extra. He was a recently retired fireman from Indiana. The recent storms and hurricane had held him up quite a bit first in Vermont then New Jersey and he was happy for the clear, all be it, cold conditions. Late in the day the AT brought me to the Lewis Mt Campground where I went to the little store full of overpriced tourist crap. They do have camper type food items and cooked hot dogs which I could not resist. It's a close jaunt to the Bearfence Shelter. I had the shelter to myself which was suprising with this being ""peak color"" season. 2 young guys showed up just before dark. They had camping equipment along with a rifle. They came up a jeep trail fron the East and had missed the turn off for the Wildlife Management Area and ended up in the park. I told them they were welcome to stay in the shelter but they should hide that gun because on rare instances ""Ranger Bob"" comes around and I don't think he would be too happy about the gun. They took a good look at my map for a while and opted to head back down the hill the same way they came. On this trip I opted to lighten the load and only bring my 40 degree bag. The overnight temp was supposed to be near 20. In the shelter I first put down my neoair sleeping pad. Then I put down the sleeping bag. After that I put down 3 large black garbage bags full of dry leaves I gathered that I then sat on to smash down. Over the top of all of that I spread out my tent with attached rain fly. It looked like a big green burito, I was quite warm all night. I think I would be OK down to near zero.","Swift Run Gap US 33, Elkton VA

This is so unlike the rest of the trail. Parking lots jammed full of cars. Today I ran into a guy doing a survey of the American Chestnut trees in the Park. I knew that the tree was almost extinct. He says that there are tens of thousands of them all along the AT. The problem is that we can't get them to survive more than 20 years. Most die within 5 years of age. There have been many hybrid variations over the decades that are resistant to the desease that took them out. They are working at producing the original again in vast numbers like the 19th Century. He showed me one that was old enough to repoduce and was flowered out. He said that several old trees do exist in Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia. I ran out of water in the late afternoon. I went into a full busy parking lot and yelled out. ""I need some water, anybody got any extra water"". Worked like a champ. I was full up in seconds. If it was only that easy on the rest of the trail. Just before dark I ran into bear #11 and #12 next to the trail 40 yards away. They looked like they were looking for a handout. I yelled out that I did not have any spare change as I passed. The Birdsnest #3 shelter hut was full of teenage yay-hoos who had parked in the nearby parking lot. I could see they were not hikers from the positioning of a tent next to the shelter. You know that place where hikers pee when it's dark and raining, right behind the shelter.

Bought some gedunk from the store and sat out on the grass with 4 students from Switzerland who were attending Georgetown in DC and were out to see the Fall colors in the park. They wanted to hear all about the Appalachian Trail. The long lines to use the bathroom were quite a funny site after 62 days on the trail. I'm thinking that it's time to move the entire trail 50 miles West on the other side of the valley and out of this park. Later on just north of the riding stable I came upon a very interesting sight. 2 women and 3 or 4 kids had a baby bear up a tree(bear #11). They were all standing around looking up at the bear from the bottom of the tree. I told them as I passed that what they were doing was not too smart and that momma bear was not far away. I kept going as fast as possible. I made it to Gravel Springs Hut an hour before dark. There was a young couple from England, SOBO thru's on a honeymoon hike. There was also a crosscountry biker from Philly who had Thru-hiked the year before. He was transiting South on Skyline drive on a trip that would end in Tuscon Az. Right before dark another SOBO thru named Nancy Drew showed up. He earned that trailname from other hikers by solving some mysteries back in Maine. He set up his hammock 50 yards above the shelter. He did not stay up there very long. About a hour after dark we were all rousted by Nancy Drew, he was having big time bear trouble.(bears #12&13) The half grown young bear had climbed the tree that one end of his hammock was tied to. When he got out with his flashlight the big momma bear was 10 yards away and stood up on her back legs. At that point he decided to come for help. Several of us with lights and a smoking stick from the fire went up to his campsite. I waved the smoking stick around and the others gathered up all his gear and we retreated to the shelter.

Nancy Drew copied down the phone number to the park rangers posted in the shelter so he could report the bear incident when he could get a signal. They may want to relocate some bears.

Pre-fabricated and made of fiberglass. They must have rolled it up here as a shell then attached the wood floor on site. It's dome shape is not such a good idea. It will sleep 2 people with hiking equipment at best. They probably planned to put 4 of them here in a cluster but found that it was too much work. It's amazing that it has lasted this long with falling trees and nearby fires. But the roof won't leak and ...any port in a storm.

I encountered a day long series of hills that the trail club calls the ""roller coaster"". Most of the trail is routed up and down these hills for no reason what so ever. If you have a map you can easily avoid them by going off trail. But I stick with the white blazes. The whole ""roller coaster"" hype is a joke. Pick any part of the trail in Ga.,Nc.,or Tn. and it will be more difficult than this section. I ate my lunch on the trail near an overlook called ""Bears Den"", there is a hostel near here that I pass by without stopping. The trail from this point North goes down hill. And in more than one way, the surface has little soil so you end up walking on rocks. I suppose this is training for the trail further North in Pa. These rocky sections are a half mile long in places. My ankles were feeling it. I had hoped to make it a few miles further to the David Lester Shelter but it gets dark so early this time of year that I opted for the Blackburn Trail Center which is another strange shelter. It's a pre-fab shed like you see for sale along the highways. It has 4 extra wide wood sleeping platforms. It would be comfortable for 4 people but they advertize 8. They expect 2 people to share a platform. A little too cozy for me but I'm in luck there are only 3 of us. It is big enough to have a wood stove. On a cold night if you get here early enough to gather fire wood it would be very nice. There is also some other sort of building that is closed up and locked. No coke machine no food for sale and the alleged caretaker is missing. But they have water, not at the shelter but at the other building. They also have a outhouse. The 2 other hikers are a SOBO thru-hiker and her visiting mother from Australia. They will head up into the park before returning home.

Not the real one, it's the one that claims to be the first one. A group of locals took a pile of rocks and some morter and made a short tower shaped like a milk bottle in the early 1800's and called it the Washington monument. They did a good job with an inside stairway. At least it's a nice little diversion for a few minutes and it's right on the trail. They also have a great little gazebo/shelter with piped in water and picnic tables. I had my snickers bar lunch there.

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/395902,"Hiking day # 75, Clear and warm. Just past the shelter I came into Rausch Gap itself. Be sure to read the signs explaining about the diversion wells located here. These wells are the first of it's kind in North America. They were built in the 80's to reduce the damage done to the creek by runoff from the coal mines. The coal mine runoff lowers the normal ph of the creek to such a dangerous level that it kills the all the fish and everything else. It was so bad that there were no fish for many miles down stream. The local conservation group decided to try a Scandanavian method to raise the ph level by building a diversion well. They built a temporary coffer dam and dug a huge pit walled with concrete and filled it with limestone rock, they then piped in the creek to flow over the limestone and then return the water to the creek a few yards downstream. It changes the ph from a 4.0 to a 6.0 in the creek. Brook trout can now be seen from the nearby bridge. It works like a champ. Every year the acid in the creek melts 2 tons of limestone away so the limestone has to be replaced by local volunteers. Too bad those ""clean coal"" companies can't do this in West Virgina. It would hurt profit I suppose. The trail makes an easy climb back to another ridge. The famous rocks in this area are a bit overated. You do have poor hiking conditions in some sections for a mile or more at a time. My big problem today was water. I made the mistake of passing up on some slow moving brownish looking creek in Swatara Gap. I was counting on finding water at the William Penn shelter. By the time I got there I had been out of water for 3 hours in the hottest part of the day. Not a drop was coming from that pipe. I went down the valley a half mile looking for anything at all. The only good option was to get back on the trail and keep going. My plan was to get to the highway in 2 hours and hitch a ride one way or the other to find water. Before I got there I was rescued by, of all things, a group of little girl scouts about 8 years old with there leader who gave me a 16 oz bottle of water. I will have to buy more girl scout cookies just to pay it back. I made it to the 501 shelter an hour later. It's not a shelter, it's more of a free hostel. Someone had left a bag of apples, thank you very much. It's possible to order take-out food from this place. I had the place all to myself.","Rausch Gap shelter

If the hiking is rough and rocky today I will hike to the next shelter. If not I will hike all the way to Port Clinton and the exit point for this hike. It feels like I have been on the same skinny rocky ridge since leaving Duncanon. I had the trail pretty much to myself today. I spooked a nice 8 point buck who promptly stopped 50 yards away and stood broadside to look at me. It's like he knows when deer season starts. The deer here are much larger than what I see in Tennessee. I encountered an abandoned campsite next to the trail. It was an old blue tarp on the ground and some other odd items. There were 3 empty and 2 full cans of goats milk. White cans with a picture of a goat.   There was also a fishing rod with a light spin cast reel. There were also odd bits of clothing left strewn about. The campsite looked abandoned for weeks. I imagined a fisherman camped for the night driven of in a hurry by a storm or a bear(or perhaps an Indian attack). I can't come up with an explaination for the goats milk. The trail down into Port Clinton was very long and steep. South bounders must hate this climb. No switch backs, even though there is ample room for them. I made it to Port Clinton just before dark and hitched the 2 miles to the Cabela's and my truck. On this section I hiked 70.2 miles in 4 days for a 17.6 average. It was all in good weather. I have hiked 1,211.3 miles from Springer Mt Ga in 76 days for an average of 15.9 miles per day.","501 Shelter

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/415626,"Hiking Day #77, Cool and dry. I drove up from Tennessee yesterday and started today by parking my truck at the Cabela's parking lot in Hamburg Pa. This is the first hike of 2013 and I intend to hike for 15 days and should end up near Pawling NY where I can take the train and bus back to the place where my truck is parked. This will be the last time I drive to the trail. From here on out I will fly and use mass transit. I will also do 2 trips per year of 2 weeks duration as opposed to the 4 trips that were much shorter. My goal is to make it to the end of the trail in Maine before I'm dead. I could not get a hitch on this busy road so I ended up walking about 2 miles to the trail at Port Clinton. It was an easy climb up to the ridge. I met no other hikers on the trail today. The Northeast has had a long cold Winter, 10 days ago this section of the trail had it's last snowfall. The high temperature today was 58 and the low should be in the upper 30's. Last year on this date everything was green. Nothing but treebuds now. Plenty of water at every spot indicated in the guide and then some others. I'm using the AWOL guide this year and so far I like it. I'm only using the pages I need. My pack weight is 24 pounds because I have my 20 degree sleeping bag and some heavier clothing. I expect to get wet so I have spare socks and a rain suit. I have very little food. This section has plenty food resupply points that I will use. Breakfast will be oatmeal and coffee, lunch will be 2 snickers bars and dinner will be a dehydrated dinner. Due to the nearness of small stores I will be able to get some hot meals on the fly. I will sleep in shelters if I can. I have my light tent if I can't. I am now just North of the easy section of the Appalachian Trail. Virginia, Maryland and southern Pa are easy hiking so 20 plus mile days are common. In this section it gets a little rougher with more rocks and more difficult climbs. If I can average 15 a day I will be lucky. This first day was easy hiking with only a few miles of rocky trail. I made it to the Eckville shelter by 4pm. It's not really a shelter, it's some guys garage right behind the house. I was worried that it would be closed for the winter as it said in the guidebook. The caretaker indicated that he opened it early. I was the only person at the shelter and judging by the entries in the log book less than 10 people have been here so far this year. It was cold overnight so I was happy to be indoors. I got a good cell signal so I could report in.","Port Clinton

After an easy climb up to the ridgeline the sun came up and I was able to remove my jacket. Once on the top the trail turns to crap quickly and becomes mile after mile of small rocks, fields of rocks. There was one section between what they call the knife edge past bear rocks to bake oven knob that was all rocks. The only thing you can do in section is slow down. There were parts where I was only making 1 mile per hour. Of the 17 miles I hiked today I would say that over half of the trail was rocks. I was exhausted at the end of the day. I have to earn my trail legs on each section I hike so I suppose I will start to feel better in the next few days. One of the places I passed today was a famous bird sanctuary called Hawk Mountain. Birders from all over the US visit this place to do bird watching activities. They even have a visitors center. It was all closed for the season when I went past. I did not see any other hikers on the trail today. I ran into a little light rain for the last hour of the day. This shelter was built in the 1930's. It's small and shows it age. I'm sure that the roof was replaced many times over the years. The spring in front of the shelter was gushing cold clean water. I suspect that it goes dry in Summer. This shelter gets an excellent cellphone signal.","Eckville Shelter

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/416747,"Hiking Day #79, Warm and clear. Easy 8 miles into town today. The Appalachian Trail continues along the same low ridgeline all morning. The trail elevation in the entire state of Pennsylvania rarely goes above 1500 feet for the most part so the only climbing you do is in the places where rivers and roads have cut through. So the rocks become the main misery of hiking to replace the mountain climbing. Hey, at least I have something to mutter out loud about. I think I saw a copperhead snake today. It was sunning itself in the trail as I hiked into Lehigh Gap. I say I think it was a copperhead because he detected me before I saw him and all I got a good look at was the end of his tail. So it could have been one of about 30 kinds of snake they have in these parts but in my mind it triggered a major fear and I made it into a King Cobra. I guess if I wasn't such a chicken I would have run it down and got a better look at it. The 17th of April after a long cold Winter seems a bit early for copperheads. In Tennessee we see them in mid May. I came out to the highway, stuck out my thumb and a guy in a SUV pick me up 10 seconds later. The town of Palmerton is about 2 miles away and he dropped me off at the town Community Center. I checked in with the lady at the window and put my pack in the basement where they have the so called, ""Jailhouse hostel. I don't know why they call it that, It's just a basement and it was never a jail. After a great shower I had lunch at the diner across the street. There was another hiker staying in the basement. At least he said he was a hiker. He had an old guide book anyway. After talking to him a while I came to the conclusion that he was a homeless guy with some old hiking equipment who was hitchhiking from free or donation hostel to another along the Appalachian Trail. He would put his ""backpack"" in a shopping cart and hang out in front of supermarkets in trail towns and wait for some person to engage in conversation with. Friendly town people along the trail can spot a thru-hiker by his looks. Other hikers can spot a fake. His story was that he was a thru-hiker out fulfilling his dream of hiking the Appalachian trail and he had the bad luck of getting sick while being trapped in a nearby shelter during the storm. Now he was out of food and funds. He was hiking his own hike. He seemed harmless enough but I kept close watch on my valuables. Palmerton is a nice friendly town and the library has some computers for hikers.","Bake Oven Shelter

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/417825,"Hiking Day #80, Cool dry start, cold wet finish. I left the jailhouse hostel at 7am. After a quick breakfast at the diner across the street I walked down main street in the direction of the highway. I stopped for a snickers bar re-supply at a gas station. I got to the highway entrance, stuck out my thumb and 10 seconds later I got a ride to the trail. Prior to arriving at this section of the trail I wondered how I would get to Palmerton. This is one of those towns next to the trail where it is easy to get a ride. The first 45 minutes of hiking is quite a thrill. The trail goes up the knife edge of a very steep rock outcropping. There is no trail, just climb from one bolder to the next. Hikers who are afraid of heights can use the blue blaze Winter trail. Once on top the trail evens out and is quite easy for several miles to rock gap which is another bolder climb. This ridge top was used by a rich corporation to dump the tailings from a huge zinc mine and smelting operation. The acid content of the soil is so high that it won't support plant life. They just hauled it up here and dumped it in huge trucks for many decades. I guess the idea was that when they were all dead gone, future generations would come up here and try to keep it from running into the rivers and killing the fish. This was all done to create what we call pot metal for the auto industry. All in all the trail was much easier today with far fewer bolder fields. The temperature started dropping about 10am and a icy rain came down gently for the rest of the day. This was a hypothermia type day. Wet from the rain and exertion with the 39 degree cold wind there was no stopping for lunch. Stopping for more than a minute or two shuts down the heat generator. So I was in for the duration and had my snickers bar lunch on the fly. I just kept going all day and with the weather conditions I could not see anything anyway. I reached the empty shelter an hour before dark and quickly gathered water and got out of the wet clothing and into my bag. It took about 20 minutes to stop shaking, then I cooked dinner. I saw no other human today. I got a 5 bar cell signal at this shelter and phoned home.","Palmerton PA, Jail house hostel

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/420257,"Hiking day #81, warm and overcast with a few periods of light rain. The trail today was much less rocky. I made it down into Wind Gap by 11AM. The trail skirts the edge of town. I just kept going North on the trail. The town has some things that would tempt hikers like cafe's and stores but they are about a mile from the trail so I press on in hopes of making it to DWG by the end of the day. As the trail approaches Kirkridge Shelter it follows a 4-wheeler trail for several miles all the way to Mt Minsi. The white blazing is very poor and with numerous other trail crossings I have to pay attention to keep to the trail. I reached DWG about 5pm and went to check out the Church of the MT hostel. It's very nice. There was one other hiker, Hatter Fox. He is a thru-hiker who started in early January. He was driven from the trail about 4 times by snow storms. He spent some time in the Navy. He was a Cruiser Sailor homeported in Long Beach and did a couple Westpac's in the 70's as a MM. So the conversation quickly went from the trail to ships. I went down to the local diner for dinner. My intention for tomorrow is to wait for the outfitter store to open at 9am to buy a few mountain house type meals then get a late start and hike the 10 miles to the MOC.

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/420841,"Hiking Day #82, Warm and sunny. Attempted and failed to sleep in a little bit. I departed the church hostel about 7:30. Had a slow breakfast at the diner. The outfitter store opens at 9am. I was a bit befuddled to find it closed, but because it is located in a converted house on main street I went around back and yelled out to the rooms upstairs. The owner came down and explained that they were open and because of it being early in the season they had ""informal hours"". Ahh small towns! After a small resupply I started across the Delaware on the long bridge. The New Jersey side has a park with some interesting information about the DWG. The trail up the big hill looks like it could be tough but it is not. This being one of the first nice weekend days of the year there were plenty of day hikers out and about. After the easy climb to the Kitty Kat ridge I could tell right away that this was different. The trail on this side of the river is greatly different than the PA side. It's like the climb up into the Smokey's. The striking difference in the rocks is quite apparent. The loose rocks and stumble fields give way to huge smooth rock formations that have been scraped clean by the last big advance of the Ice Age. You can even look at the groves carved in the rocks and see which way the ice was advancing. Where did the loose rocks go? They are piled up in the valleys and low spots. I suspect that a person attempting to dig a hole down the valley around here will have more than a little trouble with the rocks that used to be up here on the trail. I suspect that I will encounter some of these rock piles on the trail ahead. This ridgeline is more open with less trees owing to the much thinner layer of soil. I can see why they discourage campfires up here. It would be easy for windswept grass fires to make it to the trees. With all these open spots with great views there are plenty of places to camp. Just after lunch I visited sunfish pond as the AT follows the Western shore. The land was purchased by some rich guy who used the forest as a deer hunting preserve; the pond supplied water to his mansion. In 1965, there was a plan to create a reservoir which would have covered the pond. Casey Kayes, a local custodian, led 655 people on a hike to protest the plan. Further hikes and letter campaigns caused the power companies that owned the land to donate it to the state in 1966. ] Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas mentioned the pond in his dissenting opinion in the Sierra Club v. Morton case. AHH the 60's now that was a great time, I wonder what happened to the current generation? As I approached the Mohican Outdoor Center the sun went down and it started to get cold. I opted to rent a spot in a cabin for 37 bucks. I had the place to myself. It was nice and clean with electricity and a space heater. No television but they had a nice book collection. I understand that they charge backpackers to camp in the campground. This is not necessary because of the abundance of nearby campsites near a creek. I wondered why there was a gap in the normal line of shelters in this area. The club that operates this profit center is also in charge of building shelters. I can see why they call this the Appalachian Money Club.","Delaware Water Gap PA

It froze again overnight and the mud puddles were iced over and it made a rather pleasant crunching sound with each footfall. It was an easy climb back to the same ridge as yesterday. The views in this open section are excellent with many lakes and beaver ponds in every direction. Nobody on the trail today. When the sun got up it warmed up nicely. The trail is fast and I made it to Culvers Gap by supper time with no trouble. I dined at the Kevin's Steak House right next to the trail and Kitty Kat lake. I was the only patron. This place is right next ""Joe on the Go"" the home of Foulmouthed Joe. He is the coffee shop owner famous for giving hikers a hard time. He was closed so I could not go in there and get him agitated by asking for free tap water. This is odd behavior for a business owner right on the Appalachian Trail who depends on the revenue from hikers. I then hiked the next 3 miles to the empty shelter. Along the way they have built a large viewing platform next to the fire tower so with the setting sun you can see clearly for many miles. The shelter is near the road and gets a great cell signal.","Last of the Mohicans center

I also had the trail to myself. The trail went back to the ridge with the awesome views. I went past the ""Sunrise Pavilion"" which is a huge shelter which faces East. I can see why people camp here in bad weather despite all the signs to the contrary. It's a huge pavilion open on all 4 sides. They probably use it for some sort of doings, church maybe. At lunch time I made it to Highpoint state park visitor center. This place has nothing except a bathroom. No vending machines. The lady who works there said they have never had vending machines even though the Appalachian Trail goes right next to the headquarters building and hundreds of hikers ask about it every year. Go figure. Just North of the park the trail departs from the ridge and drops to the East across the grain of the Appalachian's. By doing so I encountered many creeks and swamps mixed with small ridges. The trail clubs have done a good job of building boardwalks and bridges over many of these areas. I carefully treat the drinking water in these areas. No telling what it has living inside it. I arrived at the Jim Murray shelter about an hour before dark. Great shelter, this is an un-official shelter because it belongs to a local farmer who lets hikers stay in one of his old back buildings. The shelter is about .2 West of the trail.

At one point it follows the perimeter around a squared off wildlife refuge that floods various ponds to support wild ducks and geese. At one Point I came to a road crossing, when I stepped out and looked left I saw a red fox on a parallel course who had just stepped out also, he spotted me and zoomed off. The boardwalk was a real treat. I wonder what it cost to build? I suspect that it was built as part of a park system and gets heavy use, not necessarily for Appalachian Trail hikers. From looking at the swamp it goes over I think that in the past the trail was a big road-walk in this area. I emerged on the highway that leads to Vernon just after 1pm. Parked about 300 yards to the right was a motorhome that doubles as a hotdog stand. The is the first open business I have seen in days. After a quick lunch I walked into town.

The strange geology in this area is the giant ridges of huge boulders that make this small section of New York and New Jersey a tough hike and the source of many memorable comments by just about every Trail-journal writer. I had wondered what all the fuss was about. Now I know. It's a roller coaster of rock climbing. In mid-morning I crossed into New York. I may have encountered a rattlesnake. It was a snake that was startled by my footfalls and made a run for it through some heavy cover making a rattling sound. It may have been some other kind of snake and my imagination provided the sound. I made no specific inquiries and kept going. The trail in this area had numerous deadfalls that are left over from hurricane Sandy. After 2 years of hikers making there own trail around these areas makes for interesting navigating.

They had a full soda machine and a potato chip machine which were working. Today is a Saturday and one of the nicest weather weekend days of the year so Bear Mountain is full of people. It looks also like a Hardly Davidson convention. They have routed the trail strangely around the top mountain as though they want you to get the full view in every direction.

The reason why I chose to fly in and out of Albany is the easy mass transit routes to and from the trail for this section which will take me through NY, Conn, Mass and into Vermont. Day one here which started in the wee hours in Tennessee has left me about 2 hours of daylight to hike in. I noticed that the trees are starting to turn just a bit yellow signaling to start of the Fall colors. The trail took me through gently rolling hills and lakes with an easy trail. I wanted to make it to the shelter before dark so I hurried along. I did not make it. Even though I doubled back twice I was unable to locate the shelter despite having 2 versions of the map and the AWOL guidebook. I looked both high on the hillside and low at the road crossing. It must be just off the trail with no signpost. Lacking a powerful light I failed to locate it. I gave up and continued North past the Dover Oak to some farmers freshly mowed field and set up my tent.","Pawling NY

I slept in a little bit. It was the first time I used my emergency only tent and I found it a bit cramped. It weighs a bit over 2 pounds. Hiking the AT in Spring and Fall I have found that it's easier for me to stay in the shelters. I would have slept in one last night if I could have found it in the dark. In the last few years I have avoided the thru-hiker bubble. I know that as I get to the Northern end of the trail and hike only in the Fall that it will become a bit more crowded in shelters and I will encounter times when I will be tenting. I skipped cooking breakfast because this spot I picked to camp is way to close to a farm house. I purchased some breakfast items and a soft drink at a plant store/nursery behind the little train stop at NY 22. The guy sells candy bars, chips and sodas. I met 2 South bound thru-hikers who had camped in a nearby field and were allowed to clean up in the bathroom. I pressed on through the rolling hills for an easy day crossing into Connecticut before lunch. I made it to the 10 mile creek shelter which is near a nice wide river. They have a water pump.

The town is easy to get to perhaps a half mile off the trail. I did not really need to do my laundry but because the crazy woman who operates the laundry place hates hikers and chose to discriminate be placing a sign on the door that says something to the effect ""Dogs and Hikers keep out"", I thought I would see if I could do my laundry. She did this because some teenage hiker in the past offended her by doing his laundry while wearing only his 10X10 foot tarp. I stopped at the store to get some quarters. I could see through the window that she was on the cell so I with my small bag of laundry at the ready I zipped in and quickly started shoving quarters into the washer and just like that I was in business. Next thing I know she confronts me. ""You are not supposed to be in here!"" No hikers allowed. I say, ""I'm not a hiker""! Even though I'm still wearing my backpack. What is a hiker anyway? She then went on and on about hikers this and hikers that and threatened to call the cops. I said, call the cops lady, I already started the wash. She stormed off and a few minutes later after calling somebody and says. Go ahead and finish but don't come back. That was it. I was so disappointed. I was really wanting to see what the cops would have to say. Hey, I survived Chicago in the Summer of 68, the Kent laundry protest would be cake. Nothing,...unlike Chicago, they did not show up. So with my trail between my legs I skulked out of town.If you are ever in Kent Ct be sure to stop by and at least let her know that it is wrong to punish to whole class for the sins of one student.

I kept looking for the stone tower that was supposed to be at the top.

I stopped to read the brief and interesting history of Dalton on some roadsigns. Dalton used to be called the ""Ashuelot Equivalent"" because the area was given to some local Berkshire landowners in compensation for a huge tract of land stolen be the King's Privy Council in the 1730's. That land was along a small river in New Hampshire called the Ashuelot. Hey, the stuff you learn along the trail. I had a very fine, sitdown, breakfast with several cups of coffee at the cafe. Nice little town that lacks a hiker hostel. On the way up the hill on the way North I kept a keen lookout for the stashed gold.

The gold has never been found and this area has drawn gold seekers for over 200 years. So keep your eyes open you may be the lucky one who finds it.

He had emerged here 20 minutes earlier and went right and he was now headed left. I guess he felt he needed the exercise, that's why he was running. He never showed up at the Gov Clement shelter so he must have found it. I made to to the shelter before dark. This shelter is famous for being a party place for teenagers because you can drive right up to it. It's a really old shelter. I found it well kept and comfortable. The 2 ladies from Michigan showed up as well as another thru-hiker who had started in February. [Clark] April 9th 1806 last night at a late hour the old amsiated Indian who was detected in stealing a spoon yesterday, crept upon his belly with his hands and feet, with a view as I suppose to take some of our baggage which was in several different parcels on the bank. the Sentinal observed the motions of this old amcinated retch untill he got within a fiew feet of the baggage that he hailed him and approached with his gun in a possion as if going to shoote which allarmed the old retch in such a manner that he ran with all his powers tumbleing over brush and every thing in his way.","Greenwall Shelter

I stopped to cook oatmeal and coffee at the foot of Mt Killington. The climb was easy. Here it is 27 May and there were small patches of dirty snow in the pines near the peak. I had a short break near the top at Cooper Lodge shelter. On the way down the pines gave way to the beech and birch trees for a mile or 2 and as I came down further it gave way to oaks and sugar maple. I emerged at highway 4 and it took me under 30 seconds to hitch a ride into downtown Rutland. After a late lunch at the Yellow Deli I took the bus to Manchester. I hitched back to my truck at the trail head. In all I hiked 89.9 miles in 8 days for a 11.2 average all in good weather. The Southern half of the AT in Vermont had no mud and no bugs. Lets hope that I find similar conditions in the Fall when I return. So far I have hiked 1697 miles of the AT in 111 days for a per day average of 15.3. See you in the Fall. [Lewis] April 11th 1806 As the tents and skins which covered both our men and baggage were wet with the rain which fell last evening, and as it continued still raining this morning we concluded to take our canoes first to the head of the rapids, hoping that by evening that the rain would cease and afford us a fair afternoon to take our baggage over the narrow portage.","Governor Clement Shelter

Nice place, typical of other hostel places along the trail. They were a soft sell on whatever wacky religion it was they were selling and gave up when I showed disinterest. The place was full of South bound AT hikers. This late in the season the bubble is well South of here. One of the nice things about this hostel over all others on the trail is the nearness to a great bus station, train station and Wal-mart store.    I was concerned about finding fuel because they are a no-fly item. I managed to get a free fuel canister from the hiker box. I got breakfast at a bakery next to the bus station and took the 7:15 bus to the trail. How convenient is that? It was an easy hike through the woods with no real climbs. The trail is all lakes and waterfalls. I had lunch on a real picnic table at the State Park. I encountered no other hikers and had the shelter to myself. I plan to keep my mileage low at 10 or 12 miles per day until I get my sea legs back in a few days.

It's a short day and I'm in no hurry. This area of Vermont is easy hiking on a well padded dirt treadway through the woods. Some of the trail is also a 4 wheeler trail that is poorly blazed. It means no zoning out. It's too easy to miss the point where the trail breaks off from the 4 wheeler path. This is also one of those areas where the Appalachian Trail is a very thin ribbon through private property. I encountered only 2 other hikers both South bound. I arrived at the shelter at 4pm. It's a nice location next to a creek. I noticed that the shelters here are not as nice as the Vermont shelters along the portion where the AT shares with the Long Trail. I once again have the place to myself.

In the middle of the afternoon it was about 90 degrees when I came to the Cloudland Store which is about .2 off trail. They really have little for hikers. Not even a coke machine. They sell some overpriced homemade drinks. They told me they were out of the homemade ice cream so all I got was the drinks. They had 2 chairs and a table, so I sat in the chair that was not in the sunlight. It had some sort of vinyl cover and when I went into the bathroom to top off my water the owner of the place, a young fellow with a green hat was angry that I had set in that chair because I was sweating up a storm. He told me to leave. That is the second time I was kicked out of a place on the AT. The first was the Kent Laundry. So, not exactly a friendly place if you sit in the wrong chair.

I was the first to depart and I cooked my breakfast about 2 miles North of the shelter on a rock. I passed over the White River and a small town that had nothing for a hiker except a Library. Not even a coke machine. They once had a small store that went under when the town went under....water that is. Flooding from hurricane Irene put them out of business a few years ago. It was an easy hike through the woods into Norwich. It's a road walk down Elm Street for about a mile. At least 4 or 5 residents have placed plastic boxes with some kind of food or drinks as trail magic. Some even had dog food. Quite a nice welcoming after getting kicked out of the Clodland Store the other day. I hiked through town and across the river into Hanover.

Most of the small inexpensive motels operated by people from India are operated on such a shoestring that they can't offer much in the way of a breakfast. Not this one. The only problem with this motel is that it's located about 2 miles South of the AT on Main Street in Hanover and it's not near other useful businesses. It was a easy hitch and they have a free bus if you can figure out how it works. Today started with a hike through the town past Dartmouth College which is the only real business in town. The food co-op is the only real grocery and is on the trail. The trail was another easy walk through the woods. This area has the best signage I have encountered since SNP. Most trail clubs have signage on the bottom of the list of things to do. Most hikers will not even look at the hundreds of huge signs placed on the AT by various agencies at gaps and road crossings because they don't have anything new or useful to a hiker, don't feed the bears, pack out the trash. Most hikers are not interested in the exact spot where the Hoochiecochie Forrest ends or begins. Hikers want to know useful things like, where am I? They will place Rotten crotch gap on the map and in the book but with no sign at that spot who can tell where they are? We want to know where the water is or where some camping places or how far to the shelter. On this section of the trail they have done a great job. This trail club must have some hikers.

He also have some soda's available. It was nice to relax for a bit on his comfortable couch.   A mile or two later the first hint of how the trail works in the White Mountains with a rocky climb with no switch backs up Smarts Mtn. No soil what-so-ever. It eroded away decades ago when they placed the trail on this steep slope which gives water no other option than to go down the trail and take the thin soil with it.

I climbed a short way up the sketchy fire tower with 2 missing guy cables.   At some point in the future when a big wind storm comes from the correct direction that baby is coming down.

Anxious to see just how tough the Whites are. I was advised years back by another old man section hiker to do this section years ago when I first started out on the AT. The reasoning was that the trail would take 6 or 8 years at the pace I was on and I was almost 60 back then. He said it would be wiser to do the Whites at age 60 as opposed to 65 or older. I guess I will find out shortly if that was good advice. I turned 65 a few months ago. So it was with high anxiety that I started up the long rocky trail. It was just woods for the first mile then a gradual, then evolving into a very steep, rock to rock climb. Up, up and up, I kept up a steady pace without a rest until I noticed the trees getting smaller and smaller until they turned into bushes at the top. In an hours time I was at the very summit of Moosilakee which I can't spell even with a spell checker. And I was none the worse for wear. I hung out with a large number of hikers, where they came from, I have no idea because I encountered only a handful on the way up. The real fun for this mountain for North Bounders is the really steep trail down. They have run the thing down a near cliff. While climbing the mountain took the usual toll on the legs and lungs, the coming down strained the knees. Those with bad knees must hate this one. It took forever to get down. I finally got to the bottom in the early afternoon and rested at the little bridge over the creek. Baltimore Jack was sitting at the end of the bridge like a toll taker passing out bottled water to thru hikers. He said he was camped just down stream. The experience of the days hike took a lot out of me. I decided to hike less miles that I planned. Within a mile of so I was looking for a place to camp. I found a nice spot near a creek. Later a German Lady who had just finished engineering school camped near by. My dinner was yesterdays sub sandwich that I kept in the fridg in the hostel and carried all day. I survived day 1.

It appears that no trail re-route to preserve the soil has ever happened since the earliest days of the Appalachian Trail. I cooked lunch at the top of the mountain and used up the last of my fuel. I found a great campsite just downstream on small creek that goes past the shelter. Tall trees and great places to set up the tent. I cooked my dinner on the campfire. I think that few people camp here because of the nearness of a shelter. I suspect that I am closer that the mandated half mile rule. I don't know if it's a rule or just advice. It could be that they are just after money because the trail club is allowed to charge to sleep in the shelter in this area. I love deep woods camping.

At the top this army was added to by the people who came in cars and on the cog-rail train. Standing room only, brisk business in the gift shop.

After 1800 miles in the last few months they were distinct. Today is June 21, this is the leading edge of the fast hiker bubble that started out in late March/early April, they will finish the trail in Late July or early August. Long beards, worn clothing, lean hungry, starved looking bunch. They hang together amused at the people watching. I ask a guy with a long red beard how far will you make it today? Pinkham Notch. I can't imagine it, that's down Washington over to Madison, up and over then down the hellish long rocky ridge past Osgood through the woods all the way out to the highway. Lucky it's one of the longest days of the year. I stand in line to have my picture taken at the Mt Washington sign then push on a few miles North up and over the cog rail tracks. I would have mooned them if a train would have gone by. I thought about waiting it out, but the wind came up to 30 knots or so, I continued down the wide open moonscape of a trail to the base of Washington. I was told about some good camping spots near the Sphinx trail. Going East to the right a short distance perhaps 500 yards I came to giant rocks that block out the wind so I set up my tarp in the soft grass next to a huge rock. No big trees for the hammock but enough brush for the tarp. Nobody camped anywhere near me. The soft grass was excellent for sleeping. There is enough space up here for dozens of hikers but because you are not supposed to camp above treeline there are plenty of places to set up. I was warned, if you get bad weather and are forced to bail from the trail in the Presidential's to: Go West Young Man, Go West. Never bail East. Bailing off trail East takes you into the Great Gulf Wilderness and it's a long way to treeline and it's much steeper and also the trek to a road is much further. I cooked a nice Mountain house dinner and went to sleep. It was very windy.","a Mile North of Mizpah hut

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553778,"Hiking Day #129. Fine weather for about 4 hours then out of nowhere a cold gust front slammed in from the North. Outstanding sleeping in the soft grass above treeline, a steady breeze of about 20 knots and an overnight temp in the 50's. Brilliant sunrise could be seen from the tarp. Alone on the mountain top. I slept in a bit and started hiking by 8am. I would later regret the late start. Within an hour or so the dark sky started building to the west. I ran into 2 lady's who had missed the sign and ended up going down a steep trail to the East. They were actually attempting to find the Spinx Trail and wanted to camp in the same general area that I slept in and ended up with a miserable night on a steep, rocky and windswept kraig on a trail heading down to the Great Gulf. The AT in this area is very rocky and I was racing to beat the storm to the Madison Spring hut. The first view of the hut looks like it will be only a short distance so I did not bother to put on my rain jacket or pack cover. I just made it there by seconds as the rain and wind hit. There were about 20 people in the hut avoiding the weather. It felt like a bus station. The sheets of wind driven rain blasted the windows like a hose was turned on. Warm and dry in the hut, with hot soup and coffee I read my book for about 3 hours. It was still pretty nasty out with less rain but more wind. I suited up about 3pm with rain jacket, pants gloves and hat and stepped into the breach. In the 1900 or so miles of the AT that are behind me this was the second time I put on the rain pants. I was glad to have them because as I headed up Mt Madison the rain seemed to be not so much sideways but came at me up-slope from my left, carried along by 50 to 60 knot gusts that knocked me forward more than a few times. With the winds assistance I topped out in no time and started down one of the worst down slopes on the entire trail. It's a steep, bolder to bolder knife edge of a struggle down that seems to go on forever. It's fully exposed to the wind. The sky grew lighter and lighter until the sun came back and I could see where I was going. It took at least an hour to get to treeline. I was in need of water as I got to the Osgood tent site. I put on some dry clothing and set up the hammock between 2 trees near a platform. No other persons were around. This is listed as a pay site but nobody came to collect.","North of Wash to Sphinx Trail

I keeps wanting to slip off to the side. I'm new to the hammock and need more practice adjusting the under-quilt. Not a single person showed up at the Osgood tent site. This is late June and I thought it would be crowded. This area has plenty of places to camp. Northbound between here and where the AT crosses the highway at the foot of Wildcat has tons of free camping places with plenty of firewood, well out of sight of the trail. It was a short hike today out to the highway. As I crossed a small creek I spotted a Pine Martin, it ran for the trees. If it would have been an Otter it would have run for the river, That's how come I'm sure it was a Martin. I stuck out my thumb and in 30 seconds I had a ride into Gorham. I opted to stay at a hotel, so I could catch up on baseball and be comfortable. I ate the fast food and did a resupply. I only need 2 days worth because I will end this section just past the Wildcat's.","Osgood tent site

Frank the tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555638,"Hiking Day#131. Clear and warm day. After a McBreakfast I hitched a ride back to Pinkham Notch. People go out of their way to help out a hiker. The lady who gave me a ride was not even going there, just decided to give me a lift. The hike today started with a walk around the boulder strewn North side of the little lake that has formed in the notch for about a mile. Then it was up as steep a stretch as anywhere on the trail. It took a bit over an hour to make it to the first top. The ski lift has a picnic table where I had a snack and rested. The climb is very much over hyped as the worst bit on the trail. Perhaps I found it easy because I was starting out fresh from a nero day in town. The trail was quite crowded. About a dozen other hikers were lounging about. The first peak is just one of several that must be traversed and it's not easy to tell where you are until you get to the long climb down into Carters Notch. I arrived there in mid afternoon and decided to find a place to camp. My flight out of Boston is not for 3 days so there is no need to hurry. I got a fine bowl of bean soup at the hut and sat next to the lake to read my book for about an hour. I took the blue blaze trail West a very short distance from the hut perhaps 600 yards then bushwacked to the right through the heavy trees and giant rocks. I was in there perhaps 300 yards and set up the hammock among the trees. I could still hear people talking as they walked along the trail. I cooked my dinner and read my book. No campfire here. This is a great stelth spot and I did not want any attention.","Gorham

This being a hammock trip I opted for a thin reflector pad that was purchased at an auto supply store to protect the dashboard of my truck. I chatted for a while with the very bored tent site manager who spends weeks at a time up here collecting the camping fee. It was a very easy downhill hike today with most of it being a 4 wheeler trail. When I came out to the highway I walked a short distance to the hostel and purchased a soft drink. It turned out to be a hot day down here in the upper 80's. I hooked a ride into town to the hotel so I could get the early bus to Boston's airport. It's taken me 133 hiking days to get here from Springer Mt. Georgia. Which is 1890 miles. On this short section through the Presidential's I hiked for 7 days and made it 51 miles for 7.3 mile average. Only 1 bad weather day.,"Imp shelter
