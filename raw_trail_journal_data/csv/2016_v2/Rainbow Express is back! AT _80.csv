Rainbow Express is back! AT '80,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/475627,Today is the 34th Anniversary of my finishing my Thru Hike of the AT in 1980 which is Oct 2nd. After reading all of the great entries in trailjournals.com especially the over 55 crowd I am psyched to say I am going to hike it again starting around Spring 2016 from Springer Mt northward to Bear Mt. Bridge. Then Mt. Kathadin down to Bear Mt. Bridge. Yes the Rainbow Express is back and looking forward to meeting the rest of AT Class 2016 on the trail! Looking forward to fully retiring from IBM on July 17th 2015 when I will have 34 years working there and going back on the AT 8 months later.   I was hired by IBM just 8 months after finishing my Thru Hike in 1980 so I have been waiting a long time for this moment!,"

Rainbow Express is back! AT '80,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/475630,"Today is the 34th Anniversary of finishing my Thru Hike of the AT on Oct 2nd 1980. Had to take a hike to Shaupeneak Ridge in my back yard to see the distant peak of Mt. Frissel the highest point in Conn and also where the AT traverses it. In the winter when the leaves fall I can see Mt. Frissel from my kitchen but for now until then hiking to the top of Shaupeneak Ridge will surely do to see and dream of the day I start my next Thru Hike on the AT on March 20th 2016. Called my old AT buddy ""Rippin Reils"" i.e. Kevin Reilly who I first met when registering on the AT in 1980 at Amicalola Falls who now lives in Idaho. Found out ""Rippen Reils"" is on the AT in Maine probably meeting those of AT Class of 2014 for the next 10 days. The AT has been on my mind all day and will be yearning for it the next 535 days till I get on top of Springer :.)",,Shaupeneak Ridge,"Oct 02, Thu",2.50

Rainbow Express is back! AT '80,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/475909,"Going to ALDHA Gathering this weekend! Met Tim Messerich President RPHCVC whose club takes care of AT's RPH Cabin about an hour south of me. Was killing time on Saturday while my wife was getting her hair cut nearby and walked into EMS in Poughkeepsie, NY to take a look at the AT books and there was Tim with a RPHVC booth setup nearby.   Tim informed me that ALDHA was holding their annual gathering only about 90 miles north of where I live in Ulster Park, NY. So yesterday joined ALDHA and today joined RPHVC. Hope to learn the ""new way"" to hike the AT, meet some new friends and hopefully see some old ones from 1980 when I hiked the AT.",,Williamstown MA,"Oct 06, Mon",0
Rainbow Express is back! AT '80,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/518009,"It's been 14 months since I have updated my Trail Journal.   A lot has happened. I finally did retire from IBM this past summer and have been busy researching and buying the equipment for my AT Thru-hike next year. During my research the past year I have been so amazed at how much as changed since my last AT Thru-hike back in 1980.   The equipment choices are amazing now compared to 1980. I have been sticking mainly to Cuben Fiber gear where possible and am on track to do an Ultra Light AT Thru-hike. I have been going on practice back packing trips to the NJ Pine Barrens, the Catskills, Shawangunks and along the AT in Mass, Conn, NY and NJ and absolutely love my gear. All of my electronics are usb rechargeable or have the option to use rechargeable batteries. So rather then carry a large battery pack and charge it in town I have gone with the AMPY Move Kinetic Energy generator and battery pack.   I have been keeping an eye on the AMPY for a year now and finally they went mainstream by shipping their first customer orders just the other day on Dec 1st.   I just got my pair of AMPY Moves and will update my Journal with a review in a couple of weeks after trying them out to see if I can really generate enough electric charge to satisfy all of my electronics.","
