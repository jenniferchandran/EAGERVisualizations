Maybe you found me from my TEDxUCLA talk?

TEDxUCLA Hike Your Own Hike
AT-AT Walker's 2015 AT Journal
And if you'd like to see the 2015 trail journal that shows the inspiration behind the talk...the link is above.
It's hard to believe that it's been a year since I set off to do my first long-ass section hike (LASH) on the AT. And yet, here we are! Ready for Round Two!In 10 days, I'll be out there again. I'll have to re-learn all kinds of skills that were second nature to me a year ago...but I'm also armed with a lot more knowledge heading out than I had last time! (For example, guess who is NOT eating ramen for every dinner this time around?)I vowed at the end of the last trip that I'd be back...and I'm staying true to my promise. It feels great. And intimidating. And scary. In the best possible way. This week at UCLA has been hard, as I'm sure many of you know. The shooting on campus and the professor who lost his life have been on everyone's minds and it's a sad way to end the year. I've found solace in meeting with my students (who are so lovely and gifted and funny and remind me of how lucky I am to teach them) and in thinking about the journey ahead on the trail. I find peace in people and in nature. The AT offers both.I've stayed in touch with the hikers from last summer - UFC is out on the trail right now (yay!) and Pilgrim has a summer job that won't allow him to come out this summer, although that's not stopping me from bugging him to. I've also met new hikers virtually (hello Kiba!) and am eager to see what new folks I'll meet this time around. My friend Tanya, the professor at Radford, will once again be meeting up with me, this time walking some of the trail with me. (COME TO THE DARK SIDE.....)And, oh yes, my blue pack (still reeking of the AT hiker stench, which is amazing) made its debut on the red circle of the TED stage a few weeks ago - the video is probably going to post after I'm already on trail, but I'll figure out a way to link it. It's called ""Hike Your Own Hike"" and was featured at TEDxUCLA. And no, I don't normally hike in a full wetsuit. ;-)So this is it...It's the fiiii-iiinal countdown! (Duh-dee-dee-DEEE! duh-dee-dee-dee-DEE!)",,View Entry,"Jun 04, Sat",0
AT-AT Walker ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538194,"I am so delighted! A ton to say...so much to respond to. Sue the shuttle driver (trail name Doc, because she's a physician's assistant) picked me up at the hostel in West Asheville (sort of wish I'd had time to visit East Ashevillle purely because of David Wilcox's ""East Asheville Hardware."") Sue was delightful and so helpful. I didn't realize how much talking to the shuttle driver en route to the trailhead is part of the experience. It was so wonderful to talk to someone who gets it...we laughed about the nights when you can't sleep because you smell so bad. She talked about thru-hiking back in the day before ultralight gear and cellphones. I told her about the flak I've been getting for the number of pairs of socks and undies I'm carrying. She had gone commando but agreed with me on the socks. ""Your feet are the most important part out here,"" she said. To that end, I stopped every two hours today to take off my shoes and socks and air my feet. I also planned to keep my miles low until I'm back in the swing of things. I had no blisters last year...I plan to keep it that way.I passed a family of day hikers today on Pond Flats mountain, where a boy of about 13 or 14 was on the ground, howling and crying in pain, holding an ice pack to his foot. I had actually heard him from below, long before I could see them. He kept crying and rhythmically bellowing, "" Ooow!"" (side note: reminded me of Hodor, RIP).They asked me if I knew how to help him. I remembered the tennis balls they gave us for our feet at Dance Marathon and suggested he roll the arch of his foot over a rolled up mat. Last year, you may recall, I had to skip a 50 mile stretch of trail. This is me, picking up those 50 miles in North Carolina before I return to where I left off. It is really weird to have things both familiar and new. The *smell* of the trees when I first got out of the van! And oh my gosh, the green! The green-gold! That amazing glowing green that comes from the leaves backlit by the sunshine! Is there anything like it? I walked with my face turned up towards the canopy, in love with the light.Pieces of last year have been coming back...when talking to Mountain Goat here at the hostel, I noticed him constantly and automatically scratching his ankles. Man, I remember Top of Georgia, pouring bug bite stuff on my ankles and scratching them raw. 
Little trail pleasures that came back to me...stepping on twigs lying in the path and feeling that satisfying crunch as they break in half. Taking off your shirt and feeling the cool breeze on your flushed skin. And of course: showering. Something else Sue said: ""You HAVE to have a journal when hiking."" Coming from the woman who wouldn't even carry the weight of underwear, but makes room for a journal. YES. Priorities. Didn't know where I would stay tonight - Watauga Lake shelter is closed again due to bear activity and the campsite nearby was reporting bears too. Then I saw sign for a new hostel - this one (shout out to Boots Off!) Perfect. A bottle of water, a shower, a lawn with clover and flowers to pitch my tent, coffee in the morning: just $5.00.Oh and wifi! Best $5 I've spent in ages.And now I'm sitting by a fire pit and the lightning bugs are coming out. We don't have lightning bugs in California. They're so beautiful. Half a moon above, a single star, the owner's dog in my lap. Welcome to my first day back.","Dennis Cove Road

AT-AT Walker ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538573,"I'm just saying upfront that this entry is for Pilgrim, because of how it started and how it ended. ****I can't believe that was only 9.2 miles. Didn't even break double digits. I was dying. The heat...the humidity...the relentless climb. Where do I start?I slept in, had breakfast at the hostel, packed up and headed out. The lake was beautiful...as I rounded it, I started seeing the shelter closure / bear warning signs. One had handwriting across it:DON'T CAMP HERE! FOOD TAKEN + TENT TORN UP. BEARS ARE SMART YO!I kept hearing rustling in the trees, but they were squirrels. You'd be surprised how loud squirrels can be. And when I rounded the lake at 10:30, I heard more rustling, looked up, and there it was....a bear about 100 feet away, parallel to me. They're not kidding about all these bear warnings around here!I got out my pepper spray and whistle, and began making some noise. Bear DNGF. But on the plus side, he didn't come towards me either. So on I went.Last summer I made it almost the entire trip before seeing a bear. This time? Second day!So that was my excitement for the morning. After that, the Day of Critters continued...saw a turtle, chipmunk. By the time I reached the shelter, I happily collapsed to read the log (my first of the trip!). This shelter has a weird obsession with Bob Peoples (owner of Kincora Hostel). The two main themes of the shelter graffiti and logbook: Bob Peoples is a badass and the water here sucks.Written on the blue blaze heading down to water source: Leave Your Pack Unless UR dying! Don't do it!and in the log book: I am filled with rage. DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT go down to the water source unless you have some serious masochistic tendencies. and written on the shelter wall: THAT SPRING'S A WHORE!So given all that and how tired I was, I decided to skip the water. Behind the shelter is a rocky cliff with stunning views. Extreme Tenting 2016! I set up on the cliff looking out. Major Tom arrived later. I appreciated that he called out, so as not to scare me in the tent. We compared our favorite Bob Peoples graffiti (which is all in the style of Chuck Norris jokes):Bob Peoples doesn't recognize the Periodic Table of Elements, he only recognizes the element of surprise.Mountain Goat (hiker I met at Boots Off) arrived, and he and Major Tom debated the finer points of shelter graffiti diction:""That spring's a whore...I think they need to change 'whore' to 'bitch'""'Whore' implies it has good qualities!""Misogynist language aside, I thought all of this anger over water was pretty funny (side note: I spent a portion of my hike the next day trying to think of gender-neutral noun curses to describe really long and steep water sources)Same night, 11:30 pmI fell asleep but Major Tom's snoring back in the shelter woke me up. Seriously? I had earplugs in and everything! And then rain. And lightning. All kinds of flashbacks to last year. And then something small was trying to push into the side of my tent. I peeked out through the netting and saw two large frogs jumping up the side of my tent. (Same thing that scared the beejeebus out of Pilgrim last year!)Anyway, the rain kept going, and once again, I re-learned my lesson about tenting on a slope. Tons of rain, all of it creating a slough that ran perpendicular under my tent. I could see the leaves and air bubbles going past. My stuff inside stayed dry, but I was worried about my body damming up the flow. One end of the tent was dry, so I moved around, discovered I could sleep sideways in the narrow end of the tent. Needless to say, it was a long day, a longer night, and I spent the next day packing up a thoroughly soaked tent.","Boots Off hostel / Shook Branch Road

AT-AT Walker ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538577,"Saw the cool orange salamanders again! And an exquisite green fairy moth. Huge! Never seen anything like it.Today I did a stop at the Nick Grindstaff monument along the trail. He was a local hermit who died in 1923. The epitaph read: ""Lived alone, suffered alone, died alone.""I stopped for maybe 15 minutes, when suddenly this little black cat materialized from behind the headstone! I was nowhere near a road or town, a good 10 miles from a hostel...where did this little guy come from? Did he escape from Kincora? Was he a hiker's pet? Or perhaps the spirit of old Uncle Nick Grindstaff? I opened my pack, dug out a packet of tuna, and gave it to him. Little critter needed it more than me. And I follow Neil Gaiman's ""Instructions"" (as good advice for life and hiking as it is for fairy tales):If any creature tells you that it hungers, feed it.I wasn't expecting it, but suddenly the trail today went out into a cow pasture and had an ADA accessible section. How cool is that?Met up with Major Tom again for lunch at a shelter and then again at night at Double Springs Shelter. He said he really admires section hikers because they have to regain their trail legs every time they come back. I hadn't thought of it that way.And one more ubitquitous trail thing I forgot but am definitely re-living now....gnats!","Vandeventer shelter (or Vanadventure!)

AT-AT Walker ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538609,"Oh my god, I did an 18 mile day on what, my fourth day back? No wonder my legs are wrecked. Seriously, there's all this lovely restaurant food out there and I'm in here eating peanuts I found in the hiker box because I can't get myself to WALK out to food.I probably should have split the return to Damascus into two days. I was just so excited by the idea of clean, dry clothes! I suspect it was worsened by wet socks (Did you know it doesn't have to be raining to drench your socks and shoes? Just walking through dewy grass can do it). And in doing my laundry, I realized that one pair of my socks are actually those cropped length ones. I didn't notice, I just put them on. I noticed a blister on my heel and hot spots on both heels at lunch. Maybe all of the above did it?Or ramping up my miles way too fast. Do as I say, not as I do.Last night 3 hikers showed up really late to the shelter, well after dark. Turns out they were Bambi (from Australia), Elsa (from Fullerton!), and PBS (who, yes, has a fondness for public broadcasting).We chatted with them in the morning over breakfast (they played Eddie Vedder!). PBS teaches elementary school science and said that when his kids complain about assignments, he sings ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" and ""Let It Go."" I love teachers.(okay, this is probably pathological, but I'm cooking up a Backpackers Pantry meal here in bed because I can't face putting on shoes and walking to the restaurants)In talking with the others today, I noticed this strange sensation of being out of time and place, like a time traveler. it's weird - I can talk about my memories of all the places they've just come from, as well as places ahead that they haven't reached yet, that technically would be in my future too, if I continued northbound from here. And I get the memories mixed up, since this section is out of order. For example I mentioned Partnership Shelter where you can order pizza, not realizing that's ahead of us on the trail. It's my memory but their future. I'll be glad when I get dropped off back in my normal trail-time-stream. The other tricky thing is that the people I'm meeting have been on trail a month or longer. I'm just 4 days in and still getting my trail legs (and feet...and lungs). It's going to be hard to find someone with my pace.Another thing I'd forgotten about: stinging nettle. With a name like that you'd expect it to look like thistle or be red or spiky or something. Nope. They look innocuous, just regular weeds. And when the trail is overgrown with them, there's nothing to do but go through them. So I spoke too soon about lack of blisters...and now that I have them, I have to figure out how to heal and still walk.","Double Spring Shelter
",Damascus / Woodchuck Hostel,"Jun 17, Fri",18.20
AT-AT Walker ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539008,"This morning I really enjoyed talking to a father (Secretary) and daughter (no trail name yet) at Woodchuck Hostel in Damascus. The daughter wants to become a vet, so I talked up UC Davis to her. :-) She identified the beautiful green moth I saw - a Luna moth. A woman helping at the hostel provided the name for the orange salamanders I've been seeing - red eft. I'm excited to use these new names in a poem.Woodchuck himself shuttled me to the trailhead near Trent's Grocery, where Tanya met me last year at the end of my hike. (did you know ""woodchuck"" and ""groundhog"" are two names for the same thing?) He was really happy and nostalgic as we drove there because he hadn't been in that neck of the woods (literally) since hiking there four years ago, when he actually spent the night at Trent's! He was remembering his trip and I was remembering mine. We passed the Big Walker Hotel where I met up with my friend Sara and the Breyer dealership I visited in Bland, and of course, Trent's where I had my happy reunion with Tanya.Woodchuck definitely undercharged me for the trip. He's solid good people. Stay with him when you go to Damascus! He told me stories of what it's like to run a hostel. Over Trail Days he had 98 hikers one night on the property! Rented porta potties and everything. At the trailhead when he dropped me off, I met two hikers who had stayed with him as well - Juju and Walkmoore.And then, finally....picking up where I left off last year!Today I did an Eminem film while a Daniel Day Lewis hurt.(8 Mile, My Left Foot)At one point I unexpectedly came upon a pond that wasn't listed in the AWOL guide and saw a gorgeous deer. I stood watching her for a long time before I saw her little spotted fawn!When I reached the shelter, a guy was there building an impressively-sized fire. We chatted for a long time as I helped gather wood. His name was Aquaman and he had a bunch of friends joining him from Trent's Grocery. Indeed, we had a full house there by sundown: Aquaman, Joe Dirt, Brokeback, Red Bull, Moonshine, Sandman, and two not part of that group, Yolo and Michael.It was a *lot* of smoking and drinking guys for one shelter. We heard them late into the night. But a funny thing happened...A few days ago, I found a copy of Cannery Row at a hiker box. It was right after I'd had the Steinbeck burger in Asheville, so clearly a sign. :-) (also, talk about a change in literary level from last year's 7 Steps to Midnight!) I've been reading a few pages every night, marveling at how beautiful the language is and wondering why this book is taught in high school. I couldn't have appreciated this in high school. It's a book you should read when you've had more experience. Anyway, as I was reading in my tent, a funny thing happened. The descriptions of Mack, Hazel, and the boys of the Palace Flophouse started sounding a lot like the guys out in the shelter getting drunk and stoned together. Even how they'd ""done up"" the shelter with a bit of tarp sounded like the home improvements the guys made in the book.It was like a scene from 1930s Monterey enacted in 2016 Virginia.After I finally fell asleep, I awoke to a sound that, through my earplugs, sounded like faint sleigh bells. Maybe someone was walking by with bear bells? I took out the earplugs to listen.It was a constant sleigh bell noise punctuated by one second beats that were like crisp whistles. What the hell?Whoop-duh-duh!                   snap!Whoop-duh-duh!                   snap!Whoop-duh-duh!                   snap!All high pitched and constant. I have no idea what it was. Some kind of insect? And then the owl started in. And one of the drunk guys, stumbling around in the woods, unable to find his tent.It was a restless night of owls, mystery whirring, crunching noises from the guy near me adjusting his position on his pad, and even my own stomach growling, which for a second I thought was coming from outside the tent!Side note: Weighed my pack for the first time at Woodchucks. 3 liters water (at two pounds a liter) plus a ton of food - 31 pounds. Means my base weight is low 20s. Not bad.Side note: my iPhone tagged some of my photos ""District 1"" and ""District 6."" Am I in The Hunger Games? That would actually explain a lot.Side note: Can we stop calling Wapiti the ""murder shelter"" out of respect?","Damascus / Woodchuck Hostel

And then there are hostels that themselves are destinations. Woods Hole is definitely the latter. I had heard about it last year but hadn't gotten close enough to hit it. This year I was excited it was close - and just around the time when I needed to go slower and rest my feet.An 1800s chestnut log cabin which Neville's grandparents purchased and eventually turned into a hostel in 1982.Being here more than makes up for last night.

Organic gardens. Stone walls.It's a place so beautiful, so perfect inside and out, that it almost hurts. You just can't handle it. Stained glass windows. Exposed beam vaulted ceiling. Amethysts on the windowsills. The Beatles playing in the living room.And they offer massage!

What a small world.We all sat around the community dinner table that Woods Hole is famous for, shared what we were grateful for, and feasted on rice lasagna and homemade bread and peach ice cream.""And everywhere people asked him why he was walking throughout the country.

At Cloud's Rest, looking over Perisberg, all the trees looked like broccoli crowns and a bird of prey effortlessly circled below, not even flapping its wings.I was so excited to see my friend Tanya, a professor at Radford. We made plans to meet at Lane street, since according to the AWOL guide that's where you can leave the AT for Perisberg. We were due to meet at 4:00 but quickly realized something was amiss. I was at the mileage point where Lane was supposed to be....but wasn't. Tanya was on a residential street. Thank god, this is one of the only places on the AT so far where I had cell service! We texted back and forth as I tried to pick a new meeting spot. I opened the Guthook Guide on my phone, and in the comments read that they'd re-routed the AT at this point in March! No wonder!We met up further down at route 100. I'm so happy to see her and catch up! I can't believe she's come to pick me up off the AT two summers in a row. What a great friend!

Makes up for a hard first day back in which I'm carrying too much food, still adjusting to messed up feet, and it was just a long climb up here. And thunderstorms are supposed to come in...and it's way exposed up here. I am so done with lightning.This morning Tanya made me the watermelon salad to bring with me! So nice!

AT-AT Walker ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539912,"I woke up this morning at 6:00 am and had a light breakfast to get out before the Boy Scouts (20 of them at the shelter last night). It was dark out from all the storm clouds. I was a couple hours into my hike when all hell broke loose - fierce winds, tons of rain, lightning and thunder. Luckily the Lightning was at least ""ten-one-thousand"" away, but I was still pretty freaked out to be walking on an exposed ridge line! I ran during the parts where I felt exposed and tried to stay in the trees as much as possible.So much for my newly-moleskinned feet...I got drenched. But my feet didn't hurt, so there's that.At a certain point I met up with Stitch, who had popped into the shelter briefly the night before, after he'd finished 3 liters of boxed wine on the hike up. When I asked him why he drank so much, he said, quite practically, ""It was heavy.""Stitch had been sleeping in his hammock when the storm hit and the winds were so strong they were blowing the tarp away from him. We hiked together for a while, until we got to the uphill portions where I slow down.Stitch told me he hikes ""like the government"" - moves fast and then waits around for a long time.Along the trail today I briefly met Camelot and Sunrunner (who were listening to Harry Potter audiobooks) and AP (Accident Prone), who manages to fall at least once every day. I like her a lot. She and Stitch and I ended up at the Captain's together tonight. Right before the Pine Swamp shelter (indoor fireplace!) I scared a bear that had been on the trail in front of me! Actually, we scared each other. I didn't expect a bear when Stitch and the couple had just passed through ahead of me. But there she was, set off loping down the trail like an enormous fuzzy rocking horse. But that wasn't all - she went off running away, but something else came running in my direction! A cub!!The little guy scrambled immediately up a tree to my right. Sooo cute! But at the same time, I was freaking out because I didn't want to be between mama and baby. But what could I do? I clacked my poles and kept my eyes on the trees as I continued.So now, the Captain's. This place is fantastic! He got his name for his resemblance to Captain Kangaroo (hence the kangaroo on his AT stamp). He's retired and owns this lovely property on the banks of Stony Creek, across from the AT.10 years ago, he built this zipline / pulley system that hikers could use to cross the river to his property! And he lets hikers tent on the lawn and offers free sodas on his back porch. Can you believe it? He's such a fixture that he's in the AT guides.I got to chat with him for a while and really enjoyed it. He also has two fluffy dogs.Stitch was making Spam for lunch and shared some with me - which I wrapped up in tortillas, sprinkled with Tanya's dried broccoli bits. Yum! Salty goodness after a rough day.I should sleep well tonight. Bears won't come near because of the dogs. I know (and like) the people around me and the river sounds amazing.Had a convo with Stitch earlier about trail names. He mentioned that every year some guy takes the name ""Dirty Girl"" and leaves flirty notes in the logs to mess with pink blazers (guys following female hikers hoping to get lucky).

The storm got fiercer and fiercer and the Captain came out to watch - he was worried the power would go out. It was incredible to watch the rain beat the surface of the creek.I really enjoyed just sitting in the dark with AP, chewin' the fat, passing time waiting for the rain to let up enough so we could run to our tents.At one point, I noticed my tent was glowing underneath.

It was so hot and I could feel my arms getting sunburned. Just when I thought I'd had it, nature gave me her own trail magic.Hiker hunger hasn't kicked in yet but I suspect it's around the corner.

It was like some effed up game of rock parkour.At one point Straw, Atlas, and I passed these large rock burial cairns....and I thought, how nice, they made cairns for all the hikers who blow their knees out trying to get up here.My feet are sore. And everything smells foul - even my sleeping pad and sleeping bag. This will be my longest stretch without a shower or laundry. I don't remember everything being this gross last year. Or did I just forget? Also, when I took a break at the Keffler Oak, I ate a package of plain raw ramen. I think we know what that means...I had the UCLA Fight Song stuck in my head on and off all day. This is the fault of three graduations before I left for the trail.","War Spur shelter

I can hear the wind rushing up the mountainside and the sun on the tent netting looks like glitter. I can't tell you how awesome it feels to lie here.Where do I begin?On the day Tanya hiked in with me, we crossed over a log and she paused, saying that snakes in New Orleans often are under such logs. I didn't give it much thought - you pass over logs on the AT every day. Plus last year I only saw one snake - a little garter snake on a bypass trail.Snakes came up again the other night, when AP and I were out on the back porch at Captain's, chatting during the storm. I was admiring how calm she is about confronting bears - they really don't scare her. But know what does? Snakes.It's funny because I am the opposite - bears at night freak me out (less so during the day, as I see more of them) and I'm not scared of snakes.My stepbrother had snakes growing up. My uncle had snakes (Chloe the boey and Victor the constrictor). They're amazing creatures and mostly they move AWAY from people.Anyway, around 4:00 today I was lumbering up my second long climb of the day. Dragging my feet, leaning a lot on my poles, zombie-trudging up the hill.All of a sudden, I saw a flash of movement by my left foot and heard loud hissing.I stopped and slowly backed up. There was an enormous snake coiled up just to the left of the trail. I'd nearly stepped on it! The hissing sound was surprisingly loud and continuous. I took out my phone to take a picture of it, so I could identify it later. And that's when it hit me. That hissing sound wasn't hissing. That was RATTLING. I'd seen rattlesnakes at home in Sycamore Grove, but they'd been brown and normal snake sized. THIS monster was thicker than my arm and had striking colored bands.I threw rocks to see if he'd move. No luck. I finally had to bushwhack through thick brush and trees on the cliff's edge to get around the snake. And when he heard me, he started up again.""I'm not going anywhere near you!"" I yelled.It called to mind another thing AP told me that night on the porch. She'd had a particularly bad day on the AT and was ready to go to bed when a bear started nosing around her tent. ""Not today, bear!"" she yelled at it.I hope she and I can meet again soon so I can tell her I yelled at a snake.","Niday Shelter

AT-AT Walker ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540093,"As you might imagine, selecting just one photo a day out of the dozens I take each day is really hard. Take today, for example. Do I show you any of the jaw-dropping sunrise pictures I took from Dragon's Tooth? Or do I share the vehicular wonder that stumbles its way to the local gas station chock-full of smelly ravenous hikers?Behold the Dragon Wagon.This beast is owned by the proprietor of Four Pines Hostel, a converted 3-car garage filled with fraternity couches and all the basics a hiker could need, including free beer (no interest to me), free freezie pops (huge interest to me), and free peanuts (mmmmm). When the owner is gone, he entrusts the keys to the Dragon Wagon to the most trustworthy of the hikers ---in this case, Stitch. And that person drives everybody down to the gas station to load up on food.When I arrived in the morning, Stitch gave me the nickel tour and I met several hikers whose names I've been seeing in the logbooks, including Friendly Nate (shaved head with diamond pattern Mohawk, looks a bit like Puck from Glee), Kemosabe, Wonderbro, and a German guy and his dog. We all piled into the Dragon Wagon, including the dog who laid his head in my lap, and headed off for the store. I had pizza, orange juice, and a bottled Starbucks frappucino. When flavor combinations like this sound good to you, you're either pregnant or you're a hiker. The quantity of what I'm eating is increasing, but it's the weirdness of it that really signals that hiker hunger Stage 1 is upon me.Side note: I keep being the only female hiker amongst packs of guys. It's reminding me a lot of growing up with brothers in the woods.At the hostel, I was finally able to contact Tanya through texting (still no phone service). She offered to pick me up for the night before our McAfee ascent. So we agreed on a road to meet at- VA 311, another 6 miles or so from the hostel. I left some money in the donation box at the hostel, some tortillas for the guys, then headed back to hike out and meet Tanya.Tanya has now successfully found me at 3 different random points on the trail. We have to keep meeting like this! :-) It's so random and weird. I love it. I'm very lucky to have the type of friend who is crafty enough to figure out how to find me despite GPS-defiant country roads, lack of cell service, trail re-routes, and nutty conspiracy theorists.McAfee tomorrow!","Dragon's Tooth

AT-AT Walker ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540099,"Spent the night again at Tanya and Mike's, who fed me olives and cheese and crackers and chicken and salad and peanut butter pie and chickory coffee.....that and rest no doubt led to the ridiculous energy boost I got today.I was nervous about taking a friend in for a day hike on the AT. I've never done it before and it's hard to know ahead of time which hikes will be brutal and rocky. None of the terrain around here is flat. I didn't want to kill Tanya or make her hate me. :-) We did a lot of research on the McAfee ascent, which most people rated a 7 out of 10 in terms of difficulty, or ""moderately difficult."" But what does that mean, really?Tanya borrowed some poles from Outdoors Guru Anya (shoutout!), I taped up my Achilles with Tanya's padded surgical tape (that stuff is GOLD!), and off we went to drive back to the trail.We started on the fire road and were barely into the hike when it began raining. And then I looked off to the right, and yes, you guessed it, bear.I started hollering to get him to move back, but he didn't budge. I asked Tanya to pull my whistle and pepper spray from my pack. I whistled and whistled, and he made eye contact, but continued to rummage through a tree stump he was working on. He wasn't a full-sized bear, but bigger than a cub -- what I'd call a toddler bear. (The ridge runner we met later called it a yearling, but Tanya said she likes ""toddler bear"" better). He was not moving. So we carefully proceeded.Seriously, Tanya had been on the trail with me less than an hour...and already? What is going on this year?Anyway, all my fretting was for naught. The sprinkles stopped, the trail was really manageable,and Tanya didn't hate me for taking her into the woods. :-) It's hard to describe how meaningful it is to share this experience with someone else. We talked and hiked and I just felt bathed in love and friendship. When you hike, it makes your emotions so much more accessible. Everything comes to the surface. It's hard to explain. Anyway, we got up to McAfee and the day was gorgeous and the views were stunning and it couldn't have been more perfect. We took our pics at the most-photographed spot on the AT and split a Snickers, pure-hiker-style.And then Friendly Nate appeared, so Tanya got to meet one of the other hikers.It was hard to say goodbye when it was over. Thank you so much Tanya!After McAfee, I noticed something different. I felt different. Like a horse feeling its oats, when you just let it have the reins and see it take off. My legs...I could feel the miles in them. I'd had such a rough day before, all dirty and sweaty and Frankenstein walking because I couldn't flex my Achilles without it scraping painfully. But with my ankles wrapped, my body cleaned and fed, my heart full...I looked at the map and knew I could do another dozen miles.Now, I probably shouldn't have with such a late start...I knew I'd be reaching Daleville close to sunset. But whatever.Off I went! I met Friendly Nate again at Tinker Cliffs. We were talking about the berries on the trail and he said he purposefully left blackberries for the folks hiking behind him. But then he saw blueberries up there - and blueberries....that's different.""No one's around. I will fight you,"" he said as we both attacked the bushes.I had two reactions to this:1) This guy's hilarious.2) Bring it ON!My love for wild blueberries is well established. :-)Friendly Nate was getting a room in Daleville and offered to split with me. He's way faster, so I agreed and told him I'd meet him there. As predicted, I was still hiking in when the sun went down and the trail filled with fireflies. I'm not a fan of hiking in the dark, even with my head lamp, so I jogged the last mile or so.19.8 miles and I'm not crippled. The Hiker Legs have arrived.","VA 311 / Casa Corbin

I just ate half a block of 2-day-old cheddar wrapped in a tortilla for lunch. I felt this should be documented.8:20 pm - A nice, relaxing day. Started off with the free breakfast at HoJo's with Friendly Nate. Then I headed to a cafe to have an Americano (!) in a real mug (!) and write journal entries. I love doing that.Then I hit my resupply mail drop - I got a package from Sandy, a woman who attended my TEDx talk! We exchanged emails before I left LA, but things were so busy I didn't get a chance to meet her yet. But what an incredibly sweet package! I didn't have the time to go through it all yet, and I wanted to prolong the fun of it - I was one of those kids who never asked for anything for Christmas because I like the surprise best of all. So I took Sandy's letter and scraped off the top layer of things, put them in my food bag, and bounced the rest ahead to my next stop. That way, it will be the gift that keeps on giving! Sandy, I look forward to telling you about how I eat / use / share the lovely and thoughtful things you sent! Let's just say that Trader Joe's products are GOLD in the woods!Coming out of Daleville, I had WAY too much food. This happens to most hikers leaving towns. My pack was heavy as sh*t. I'll have to eat the heaviest food first (like aforementioned block o' cheese).Since I didn't get out of town til 11:00, I knew it would be a short day. I decided to take my time and enjoy it. I pulled out my bowl and collected blueberries and blackberries for tomorrow's oatmeal.When I got to a pretty little stream to collect water, I noticed all of these little fish...and I don't know if it was me being observant or outright playing, but I got out a packet of ramen and fed it to the fish and crayfish, filming underneath with the GoPro. The crayfish grabbed a chunk of ramen and held it triumphantly...it was pretty funny.I got in about 7:00 and met Woodstock and Rebel Bear. We chatted over dinner and I called them back behind the shelter to see this incredible moon-faced owl. (Letter from Hogwarts?) There are TONS of birds in this area. I noticed a bright, practically neon, red bird with black wings. Rebel Bear said it was a scarlet tanager.The owl noises tonight are out of control!whup-whup-whup-WHUP-WHOOOOOOORL!!!(increasingly louder barks of noise, rhythmic, then the big trilling one)Side Note: I have a huge writer's crush on Lin-Manuel Miranda. I downloaded the Hamilton soundtrack just before coming out and it plays in my head a LOT. The fast pace of the songs is perfect for uphill climbing, when you just need a little more motivation. I don't usually play music because I need to conserve the battery and I like natural sounds, but if I'm heading into a town, I treat myself to playing Hamilton. The parts that mention Virginia are perfect! And I totally started crying during Eliza's solo at the end. See, I told you hiking makes you emotional.I love the music to pieces. I will have one night in NYC (Friday, July 29) before I return to California.

Oatmeal with walnuts and wild blueberries and blackberries might just be the best food there is.The blackberries turn magenta in the heat and the juices give the oatmeal a soft violet color.It takes food that sometimes I just have to swallow and turns it into something to savor. Mmm. I must share this with Erica Wohldmann, who did the TEDxUCLA talk on foraging. I'm following her example in the small way I can - being mindful of what I take from nature and trying to give back where I can - giving water to trees, picking up trash I see and packing it out. I don't have enough hair to leave for bird nests though. :-)1:30 pm - Sitting next to a trash can somewhere along the Blue Ridge Parkway. I didn't stop for lunch and saw this trash can and thought it would be a good time to plop down, rest, and find any trash I have to deposit here.The weather today is just perfect - slightly overcast, cool, almost like fall. Much better than hiking in the heat. Thinking a lot about having kids. I think it's what happens when you see deer with adorable tiny fawns.8:15 pm - Middle Creek campground. Lying on my own picnic table, enjoying being clean (washed with my dish soap and dried with paper towels in the bathroom!), listening to a little creek and the music of the family car camping next door. Its actually nice. I miss music.While my and WonderBro's stuff is in the dryer, I walked up to the play equipment, hit the swing set, and am now sitting on a dock over a pond. It's pretty incredible and odd and lovely...I spent a chunk of today's hike picking berries and getting sunburned. You need three things to get a bowlful of berries:1) an eye for detail2) a willingness to go slow enough to see the berries3) a willingness to stop and pick them I have all three. And little did I know that I'd end up at a campground that serves milkshakes.Did I order a vanilla milkshake and cover it in berries? You're damn right I did!Kind of wish I was here for the 4th of July. I bet this place will be hoppin'!Earlier ""Don't Stop Believing"" started playing and I looked down at WonderBro's campsite and started headbanging. He saw me and laughed.""You forget that it's not all hiking!"" he called out. ""People are having fun!""I know what he means. You can get too bogged down in the miles, walking, the routine. You need to shake things up, even out here.There's something called the Virginia Blues. A lot of people quit here. Maybe because Virginia is so hard and such a long state. And for the thru-hikers, their shoes seem to be giving out around here.Ooh! Lightning bugs under the bleachers! There's some old school Americana here...a summer resort. Cheap outdoors fun. We don't really have anything like this back home.WonderBro is 29. He told me he thinks he's part of the last generation to have the play-outside mentality, since Facebook and the Internet and things really took off when he was in high school.He mentioned playing outside...the way you knew where your friends were by the bikes outside.Made me think of my brother Sean.11:50 pm (almost actual midnight, not Hiker Midnight!) - WonderBro, who I briefly met at 4 Pines hostel, came into the shelter late last night. We were both aiming for this campground today, so we joined forces. A woman offered us a lift when we got off trail, which was fortuitous - we made it in time for bacon cheeseburgers and shakes!After setting up and showering, we went to the rec room for a rare treat - watching a movie!

I really enjoyed talking books with him.We read in the log at Cornelius Creek shelter that it was worthwhile to press on and camp at Black Rock 1 mile north, so we decided to check it out.

We've just come from taking a million pictures of the sunset and the ever-shifting violet ridges.Today we also saw the stunning Bryant Ridge shelter. I haven't seen anything like it on the AT. The architect built it in memory of his son, I believe. It had a beautiful poem to him under the eave on the second floor (enlarge photo to read). It had a porch, multi-levels, plexiglass windows...just stunning.

The climb out of Harper's Creek took waaaay longer than planned. It was so disheartening to realize how long Id hiked to only cover 6 miles.
(waiter brought the check. He thinks I'm done. How cute.)
I had told Tree Streets Inn I'd be in today but would confirm date. But I've had no cell reception. I had lunch at Maupin Firld shelter and figured I'd push for Paul Wolfe, even though it was another 16 miles. But when I got to Reeds Gap and got reception, I learned Tree Streets had reserved a room for me TONIGHT, and they were fully booked tomorrow! This was my only chance. So I told them I'd try to make Rockfish Gap by 10:00 pm. And I started running / mad-rock-scrambling. But I still had to ascend Humpback...it was becoming obvious that I couldn't make it and I was killing myself trying to. (broke a tip off my poles in the scramble)
But I could hear cars...what if I had reception at the road? I could call for a shuttle! So that's what I did when I hit Dripping Rock. Yellow Truck picked me up and took me to Tree streets in Waynesboro, where boxes awaited me (thanks for the coffee, Mom!!). A lovely Victorian B&B (thanks for going out of your way to do my laundry!) and a shuttle to Ming's, which Orion had been telling me about. I sent a pic to Big Mama for him.","Harper's Creek Shelter

AT-AT Walker ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542902,"A funny story from last night - When you're immersed in a culture and lingo, you take for granted that people know what you're talking about. There's a lot of AT jargon and the longer you're out, the more you pick up, the more you add to the lexicon.Last night we were all around the picnic table and The Counselor was discussing his brown blazing. The DC woman said, ""Oh, I follow my husband every time he brown blazes."" And then she smiled sweetly.Everyone sort of stared at her.""'Brown blazing' means going to take a dump,"" I said quietly.hahaha!!!! We all lost it. They laughed too. I'm not sure what she thought it meant, but definitely not that!I was first out of camp this morning - I usually am. Which is so weird to anyone who knows me. I just wake up, do my thing, follow the same pattern every morning, and I'm good to go. Perhaps the Trader Joe's coffee packs help. :-) Thanks Mom!We crossed a long bridge over the Shenandoah today - awesome, but very, very hot. Straw and Atlas have long sleeves to protect their skin. Me, I don't have sun protection, so I have the world's most ridiculous tan. There are white strips of untanned flesh at my elbows, since my arms are always bent with the poles! And my scoop-necked shirt is also leaving a real awesome semi-circle tan line. And where did all these freckles come from? Last year I came out with a long-sleeved sun-protection shirt, but it was too hot and I ended up sleeping in it. Next year I'll have to figure out something for the Whites - no trees, full exposure. You sweat off sunblock and it's too heavy anyway.I was excited to get to ATC's headquarters. Really exciting! They keep photo books of all the 2,000 miler hikers, both section hikers and thru hikers. The color of the number indicates which you are.When I walked into the hiker room, I saw Brokeback again! This time with Moonshine. Later, we ran into PBS and his family. It's so weird, the roving community out here. It's so much more pronounced this year than last year. Once I met up with Straw and Atlas, we ate a lot of food, got to the Teahorse Hostel (named for the hiking trail in China), did laundry, and then Atlas and I played two games of Yu-Gi-Oh! (on a real table! With chairs! Like civilized people!). The other people on the hostel are mostly long distance cyclists. It's interesting to talk to people in a different crazy sub-niche. :-) A cyclist father was sitting at our table teaching his daughter chess, as Atlas continued to tutor me in the art of casting spells, setting traps, and summoning monsters with ridiculous punny names.I'm aware that I only have a few days of journaling left, so let me talk about Frankenlegs. It's pretty much a ubitquitous phenomenon among AT hikers. Basically, you're a hiking machine all day. You move constantly. And when you rest for 5 minutes or more, get off your feet...this happens. It's like your muscles all freeze up. You can't bend or flex anything. You hobble around like Frankenstein. It hilarious to see in town....smelly zombie-walkers stumbling around looking for beer and pizza. Or you walk into a restaurant okay, but then you can't get up to leave. Or you stumble to the door and gingerly ease your way down steps.To an outsider, it must make no sense. How can people who don't appear to be able to walk 10 feet...be able to hike up and down mountains? But it's just what happens. And it disappears almost as quickly as it comes on. My friend Tanya has seen this both years so far - me hobbling up and down her stairs, having to put both feet on each step and brace myself against the railing before attempting the next.At Tea Horse, I weighed my pack without food and water. Base weight: 18 pounds. Not bad! I'm just carrying a lot of weight in food. I don't feel the weight really anymore. Just the heat and inclines. The ATC actually had heat warning signs up. The air feels heavy, muggy. It sucks energy from you.It's so hard being in great shape, being easily able to keep pace with thru-hikers....and knowing that I'll be getting off soon, will lose it, and will have to get it back. But at least I know I can get it back. And it takes about 2 weeks. :-)","Blackburn ATC Center

She especially needed one because she took a tumble on the rocks (Seriously, Maryland is trying to kill her) and cut up her leg.

Is this what PA is like?Atlas was way ahead as usual today and I was back with Straw. We were making our way down a steep path of boulders when I saw a snake blocking the way. ""Straw?

I asked.She came up.""That snake is NOT green!""So yes, another rattlesnake.And yet again, the sucker would NOT budge. We threw rocks, bark...Straw even accidentally beaned him on the head with a piece of bark. Still wouldn't move. Finally she tossed a rock that landed close enough to rouse him and trekking piles offered the rest of the encouragement.We hung out at the Ensign Cowall shelter (If Simon Cowell was on Star Trek?) for a while, ate, rested up. Atlas found a sparkler left over from the 4th of July and lit it. We met Stumbleweed. And we decided to press on.When we got to this stream area, Atlas thought it was too pretty to leave. Straw taught me how to hand a hammock. Atlas reviewed the PCT hang with me. We all waded in the stream. A section hiker from New Jersey joined us.

They responded, ""It's cooler.""Straw said earlier that she doesn't think the trail changes you so much as lets what you already are come out even more. I guess I agree.

If you're looking for the start of my complete AT section hike, look for the 2015 tab on the blue bar to the left.If you're looking for the beginning of my 2016 AT journal, hit ""first.""If you're looking for my TEDxUCLA talk, it's here:

TEDxUCLA Hike Your Own Hike -------------------------------------------------------------------Today is actually August 30, but I'm not sure if changing the date will mess up my stats on the site.I've waited a long time to finish this up - my apologies! Part of it was the flurry of activity, part of it was hanging on to the last vestiges of the trail and not wanting to admit to myself that it was over (at least, for now!).On my first night off trail, I noticed a Dr. Seuss quote on the wall of the kids' room where I was staying:""Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.""And maybe that sounds cheesy, but it's really what I needed. Post-trail depression is real. If I feel this way after just 6 weeks of hiking, I can't imagine what it must feel like for the thru-hikers. The first morning I woke up at Gish's house, I walked in and the TV was on to Fox News. I felt assaulted by all the bad news - the political coverage, the bombings and attacks that had happened all summer. It was the beginning of me realizing just how much had happened in the world while I'd been in the woods.Mrs. Gish made the best breakfast I'd had in ages, then Gish whisked me off to the train station, where I caught the Amtrak (ironblazing!) to Rhinecliff, NY for a writing workshop with cartoonist Lynda Barry. I got to Rhinebeck, home of the Omega Institute, which funny enough offers tenting as its cheapest form of accommodation. My tiny ultralight backpacker's tent was utterly dwarfed by these enormous car-camping monstrosities that everyone else was staying in. I easily could have pitched my tent INSIDE of one of theirs. Everything felt weird. How easy it was to shower. To eat. To set up a tent...and leave it there for 5 days. I signed up for meditation. I took a trapeze lesson (because why not? My body was as fit and singing with energy thanks to 6 weeks of hiking). I tried to adjust to suddenly being surrounded by people. I kept wearing my hiking bandanna, holding onto the last vestiges of the trail, the re-wilding process. Everyone else was at the retreat to get back to nature, but it was a step back into civilization for me. I wrote a lot. I tried not to be ""that person"" who constantly talks about one thing. But all I could think about was coming off the trail.When the workshop finished, I caught a bus back down to New York City, where I had a night (which became 3, thanks to my flight being cancelled) before returning to LA.Thank god I'd had 5 days at Omega before hitting Grand Central station. Walking around New York City in my trail runners and pack....that was really surreal. Anyway, if you're curious about how my Hamilton obsession turned out...yep. I totally got a ticket from a scalper! I wore the only nice clothes I had, my trusty blue town dress that has traveled via bounce boxes all over the east coast for two summers now. And I saw Hamilton, with some of the original cast. And it was AMAZING and everything I'd hoped for!The strange thing is, when I hear the music now, I have vivid associations between it and the trail. It became the soundtrack to Virginia for me.So Hamilton happened. I got stranded in New York for 3 days. I stayed in an AirBNB home made out of shipping containers. I reluctantly shaved my legs, stopped wearing my ""hiking spats,"" and gradually started looking less like a hiker. And I flew home to finish my book.Atlas continues to text me from the trail, and his descriptions are sweet torture for me - I'm both so happy to experience it vicariously and so sad that I'm no longer there. I think that's the way a lot of people feel (Actually, I know it's the way they feel - several former thru-hikers have written me about feeling that way when they read my journal entries). It's actually been two summers now that I've come off trail early in order to finish a publishing project. Last summer was Neil Gaiman. This summer I finished up Poetic Salvage: Reading Mina Loy, to be published by Bucknell University Press in conjunction with Rowman and Littlefield in December.It was strange to come back from the woods and immediately jump into proofreading, editing, and indexing. Again.And how weird it was when I made my first hike with my regular Sunday hiking group and could see the Pacific from the trail. We're not in Kansas (err, Virginia) any more, Toto. (Returning to my diving gig at the Aquarium of the Pacific was lovely though! How I missed being in the water.) Classes start soon and I'm thinking of how I'll frame this experience for my students and what I'll do with it in terms of writing and my life.I'm also thinking that if I don't come back early, if I don't do any writing projects, if I spend every minute of summer I have next summer...will I be able to finish the rest of the trail? I guess we'll find out next summer!STATS:527   Total miles40    Total days5      Pairs of socks and underwear I carried5      States I walked through0      Times I fell and the poles didn't catch me 2      Miles per hour (estimate I used for walking distance)2      Sets of clothing I carried (clean for night, dirty for day)10+      Bee stings10+      Bears I sawTotal Amount of AT Covered So Far: 1,104.30 miles","Old Forge Picnic Area
