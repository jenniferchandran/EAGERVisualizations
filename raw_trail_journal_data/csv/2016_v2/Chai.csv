Chai,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/429397,"I finished my first solo backpacking trip this day. It was very good experience. I learned a lot about my self. I took my dog Shiloh. We started at Tesnatee Gap with the intention of sleeping at Low Gap Shelter. The weather was very humid and I have decided that summer backpacking in GA may not be for me! We made it to the shelter around 5 or so. We got set up, cleaned up, and ate dinner. I just couldn't get comfortable in the open shelter like that and feared Shiloh might run off if I fell asleep. So we packed back up and headed back out on the trail. We came to a nice campsite around 7:30 and set up camp. I felt so much better about our spot and about being in my tent. I got to talk to my husband, Joe on the cell and I think it made me feel better to have someone know where I am camping since I left the shelter and varied from the original plan. We woke up around 7 and hit the trail about 7:30. The hiking on Sunday was tough. There was a lot of rocks everywhere. I was a little worried that as clumsy as I am I might slip, fall, and break something but I just tried to be extra careful and hope Shiloh will carry me out if I fall! (not likely) I was exhausted, hot and super worn out by the time I had to leap frog across the road to get to the parking lot. I saw several men standing next to their truck. I yelled out to them about playing frogger and they said yeah they had to do the same thing. They said, ""They have been waiting awhile for you"". I said No I have my truck here. And then I saw Joe waiting for me next to the car with ice cold snacks and soda! What a pleasant surprise. He was so proud of me and that made me feel awesome. Thanks Babe. It was a tough hike but I did it and I feel stronger for it now. I look forward to my next big hike.","Tesnatee Gap
