Badwind,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544901,"I been wanting to go to an AT place and start to see what the trail looks like, get a little of the experience, so for my Father's Day present I asked my family to accompany me on a one day excursion. My wife Cheryl and two of my kids (Matthew and Jennifer) could go, my middle child Valerie wasn't able to due to work. I figured out that Max Patch was a spectacular and easy enough location to get to, that my family wouldn't mind driving 5hrs just to humor me. We set out about 10am from Lillington, NC, arrived about 5pm after eating, traffic and stuff. It was sunny and very pleasant, mid 70s. We walked up to the summit via a very steep path at the choosing of my kids. Then Cheryl and I walked back down and up via another path to get something from the car, then we walked north on the trail til it exits the mountain into the woods, then back up to the summit, then I walked back down to the car to get some stuff for the sunset and cooling off as the sun went down. So, I got the full experience of walking up and down Max Patch from every possible path/trail...which is a good thing since we came all that way to get a taste of the trail. We saw a magnificent sunset, worthy of all the talk of what a great vista Max Patch is, thought about staying after dark to see the stars some, but saw clouds start moving in so decided to not do that. We left the crowd on the summit and headed back to the car. On the way down, Matthew was able to help a couple of college kids who's car had gotten some rocks in the brake area and were making a horrible noise. They got one of the rocks out, but didn't realize there was another one in there. AFter getting it out, their car moved fine without the awful noise anymore, another disaster averted as they say on ""Who's Line is it Anyway""...then off to the hotel in Franklin. We also took the other/long/wrong way down off of Max Patch, which had our GPS telling us to take a road that wasn't really a road (unless you have a 4-wheel drive jeep that climbs over rocks), so between that and helping with the tire and the torrential downpour we went through on the interstate, we didn't get to the Knights Inn (Franklin) until almost 12:30am. Thanks to the manager for getting up out of bed to open the door and check us in! Next day we gem hunted at Cherokee Ruby Mine and went home to spend our newfound wealth.","Lillington

Badwind,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544755,"Enjoyable trip and hike today from Lillington to Pilot Mountain State Park near Pinnacle, NC, with my wife Cheryl, son Matthew, daughter Jennifer and her friends Shane and Jake, plus our dog Cole. Hiked 3+ mile trail to summit partially in the rain that started within 3 minutes of us stepping out of the car and onto the trail....rather steep and a good example of how difficult the AT must be when multiple peaks like this are often hiked on one day. Did stop raining and thick clouds/fog cleared while we were at the overlook so we did get some photos. Chick-fil-a on the way home for a fully successful day! Hopefully this will lead to more.","Lillington, NC

Badwind,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544899,"Adding some additional background...my son, Matthew, and I did a hike around Pope Army Airfield's runway (a 6.5 mile loop) on 30 July 2016, in the morning before it got too hot. I was doing it to get a feel for how long it takes me to hike a measured distance (for the record, it took us about 2hrs 15min). I've been a runner since high school, so I know approximately how long it takes to run different distances, depending of course on how bad a shape I'm in, but not about walking ""speed"". Matthew was going with me to see if there are any different Pokemon from the areas we/he normally searches. There were a few, so a successful morning for us both, plus enjoyable time together!","Pope Army Airfield, NC

Badwind,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544900,"On 23 July, another hot morning, walked around Campbell University campus with Matthew looking for pokemons/getting exercise. Went thru the new tunnel under 421 to the football field area and had a good walk/hike overall. We have also been walking around Lillington in the evenings, maybe 2miles at a time, so he hunts pokemons and I get some walking and enjoy his company too! We get to talk about all the important stuff of the day (like how to take over a gym). It's an odd good thing about the Pokemon Go game, hopefully offsets the people crashing their cars and walking off cliffs while playing.","Campbell parking lot
