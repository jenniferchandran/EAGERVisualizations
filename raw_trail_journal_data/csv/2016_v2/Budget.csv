Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524959,"Well. I'm still sitting here trying to figure out when I can leave. So much to do to close out the business and list the property. Hopefully much will be done this week. 34 Years working in one place has been a blessing. Two kids through college, house paid off, and just turned 63. Its never been good to go out of business but at least the timing was ok. I miss my co-workers every day. They were like family to me.Pictured is my son and his wife who did the trail in 2012. I never thought of the AT as anywhere I'd want to go. In my native New York the trail was always crowded and worn. I always liked the Adirondacks or the Catskills. The AT ran through neither. But these two really made the trail come alive for me.So here I wait. Soon we'll know when,.....BK",,salisbury,"Mar 26, Sat",0
Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/525175,There has been much trial and error on my equipment. I bought a Go Lite Jam 70 three years ago for a trek to Philmont. I was new to frameless packs after 25 years of backpacking and 5 treks to Philmont Scout Ranch. I worked hard at figuring out how to get the thing tight enough to be able to make the load lifters work. I wound up making a frame insert until it would handle the heavy loads that Philmont Scout Ranch demands. After a couple of years I found a Go Lite Quest 65 for $60.00. It stunk to high heaven but after some tips from Backpackinglight.com its cleaned up well and turned into a pretty good pack.My base weight in 2003 was 43 pounds. Yep that's right. No more 6 pound Kelty Redcloud. My Quest is 3 pounds. So many things I've learned since my kids did the Trail in 2012. Dumped my Whisperlite for an Etowah alchol stove. I now have an Xlite mattress and a Western Mountaineering Alpinlite bag. My army fieldjacket liner has been replaced with a Montbell puffy. With three days food and everything but water I was 23 pounds yesterday. It made the 17 miles through the Uhwarries a breeze.,,View Entry,"Mar 28, Mon",0

But work has taken its time wrapping up and we both could use the income. So now we have to leave later. The week it takes to flip will put us into December. One direction will be the most efficient.I never wanted to join the big migration north. Its gotten way out of hand with the number of folks starting in March and April. Plus I love the fall. When my kids flipped in 2012 they got caught in a wicked snow storm from Hurricane Sandy. Two feet of snow threw them off a week. Either way, they enjoyed the solitude of empty shelters in November.

Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530629,"Well we finally have a kickoff date, We will leave Katahdin on June 14th.
Everything is set, all tickets bought, reservations at Baxter ready.  Ever since last summer, I have been training on a new section of the Uwharrie Trail. Although the Uwharrie mountains aren't very big, if you take it the right way they will really work you out. By going over Dark Mountain, Little Long Mountain and King Mountain and coming back over them again you really get a good workout. When I started out we were doing 10 Mile sections but now we are up to 17 miles in 8 hours.  Mark and I have been trying to do it every week and Mark continues to do it more times than that when possible. Yesterday got hot during the final ascent up dark mountain making it really tough. I think I got a little bit of heat exhaustion. This will be no comparison to the White Mountains of New Hampshire but at least it's a starting point. Mark and I have been to Philmont many times so we have crossed mountains over 12,000 feet tall and put in long miles. We've sectioned some of the AT near Roan Mountain and spent time in the Linville Gorge area. One of our toughest hikes has been on the Black Mountain Crest Trail coming up the back side of Celo Knob and going over Mount Mitchel.",,Montgomery and Randolph County North Carolina,"Apr 30, Sat",0

He is going to be our first Rayado participant from Troop 442 in quite some time. Rayado is a challenge and leadership Trek at Philmont Scout Ranch that is three weeks long and probably 200 miles in length. He will see the entire Ranch in those weeks covering many many miles. The Rayado agenda is kept a secret. Rayado participants go on to become Philmont Rangers. They are known as ""Rowdy Rangers"". I am proud to say that my son Kurtis (Almost Eagle 2012) is a Rayado veteran and that our Troop will now have a third Rayado veteran.This weekend has been spent on logistics and food planning.

Lots of time put into getting everything done before I go. Too much to talk about. But its the shaking of peoples hands and saying ""See you in 6 months."" that really brings it home.While training in the Uhwarries last week I ran into the Land Trust for Central NC's thru hiker event. Great folks that really care about the future of the Uhwarrie Forest. They had a local brewery donate some beverages and food was catered by a local outfitter for the hikers. They were having way too much fun. There I met a hiker my age who finished the AT in 2012. These are the words of wisdom he left me:1. Don't try to keep up with the kids. It'll kill you.2. Take lots of pictures of people. The views are great, but its the people you meet you want to remember.3.Like it says in the book, Appalachian Trials, write down the reasons you want to take on such a huge task. Its probably gonna suck more than it is going be great. You'll need that when you are shivering in the corner of a shelter He also told me the saying at the bottom of every journal I write about miles and smiles.

""It's a love-hate relationship right now."" He said. I told him he'll love that mountain later.

At first I thought, ""I don't know this number I'm not going to answer."" Then it dawned on me. I pulled over into a parallel parking space and slammed brakes right behind a parked cop car with the cop inside. I fumbled for my phone to hit answer before it stopped ringing, and what do ya know, it was BK! ""I'm calling from a buddy's phone I gotta make this quick, we're doing great, we'll be at Chairback Gap Lean-to tonight. We've done 12 miles today. Chairback Mountain was a rock scramble.

Debbie was also able to receive a call from him @ 10pm on Friday, when he sat on a bench outside the library. Here are the details of our conversation:He and Mark were able to book a semi-private room at the Lakeshore Inn. There are a lot of hikers staying there and most had to get a space in the bunkhouse. They have showers and laundry services there. Yay!!They hiked 15 hard miles to get there and are now out of the 100 mile wilderness!! Will stay there until Monday to get a much needed rest, also there is a big celebration weekend planned for hikers in Monson, so it should be fun for them.Had dinner, well fed, BK had his first lobster roll. Debbie reminded him about the cobbler that LB says he must try.They have seen beaver, grouse, falcons and red squirrels, but no moose or bears.... Debbie is personally glad about the bears!!BK has lots of blisters in the boots that he has hiked many miles in during training. Never got a blister in them before. He says the current boots have to go, but not sure of what he will do for different ones. Otherwise, the rest of his body is feeling great now. He thanks Kurtis for his advice!He says tell LB he will not need a resupply box for a couple more weeks.He seemed very happy, but says his mind is not all the way there yet. Plans to keep going, and knows that every hiker has to overcome this in the beginning.BK & Mark will stay in Monson, ME thru Monday.Congrats guys finishing the 100 mile wilderness.

That is the time spent in town putting back on the weight you lost and letting your body rest. They told us to the quickest way to put weight back on was drink whole chocolate milk.

All are resolved except for my feet. My boots are just not up to the terrain here. I got blisters. I've never had blisters before. I think a new pair of boots is in my future. Mark really looked after me. Wasn't I supposed to look after HIM?The 100 Mile Wilderness was a completely different environment. The day started off hiking up a hill/mountain, then coming down the mountain, walking along a beautiful lake (pond) across a bog and then going over another mountain,desending down the mountain, then walking along the lake and across a bog, and then repeat. The bugs were as expected. Black flies got us in only a few places but the mosquitoes were ever present. Deet and headnets became the fashion of the day. Never saw a moose. Plenty of moose poop though.We were never alone. Every four hours or so we'd pass somebody going the other way or a younger person would pass us. Often we ran into the same people each night. As my feet deteriorated we became SLOWBOs instead of SOBO's. There were many folks in my situation. So we would wind up in the same shelter area at night. The young folks we started with are long gone.We were always in the green tunnel except when we go atop a mountain or hill. You could hear the sounds of the lumber operations in the distance. What brought home the remoteness was when you got atop a mountain and couldn't see a building or road anywhere.

They climbed two mountains today, the top of Avery Peak was very cold, 39 degrees. All was very rocky. They are on the hardest part of the trail. The more south they go the easier it will get.
BK hiked in his Tevas the last mile, because his blisters are so bad. Hope he gets his new boots this weekend, but I worry about breaking in a new pair while on the trail.
Otherwise all seems well. They have not seen any bears the past couple of days, but have seen rabbits, beaver and rough grouse.","

Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540642,"While LB is working 12 days straight I figured I'd log in today. It was a pretty tough day yesterday so we opted to pull into Cranberry Sream Campsites after 10.4 miles. It was nice to go to bed a little earlier and sleep in on Sunday morning.After I was awakened by a lick in the face by another hikers dog, we hiked out two miles to the road and caught a ride into Stratton. My first hitched ride since 1976.Once in town we checked into the White Wolfe Inn. Today was spent lounging about town with new friends Grandpa and Achilles. Then doing some laundry and cleaning up. Mark just finished another eating challenge,""THE WOLF BURGER"". He is eating his way across Maine.My feet are much better. Deb suggested I wear my sandals. This worked out very well. I climbed over several peaks in my Tevas. My new boots are comfortable but breaking in new boots on the trail can be tough. I figure my Teva sandals will give me a break if need be.Thanks to my trail support, LB who has updated my Journal religiously and has sent supplies as needed, Kurtis for words of encoragement and advice, plus Deb for my boots and all home support while I m gone. I miss her terribly. Thanks to Mark for looking after me through the blisters. You are all a blessing to me.Not sure what we'll do tommorrow.

Thats called a nero day for nearly no miles. Today we hiked no miles. Thats called a zero day. We have enjoyed the day off. Mark has a cold and I let my feet heal. We've eaten every thing we can get our hands on. It has been great but knowing there's more miles ahead makes us ready to get back out there.We have enjoyed the people of Maine. They are a freindly but tough lot here in western Maine. Winters can be brutal and the main industry of paper mills is in transition. These are the folks that turned back Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg. There are lots of blue stars in the windows and many young disabled veterans. These folks are unique,...but quiet about it. I like Mainers. We've met some good folks on the trail too. You kind of drift in and out of circles of peopleas they take days off or speed up. Its been fun meeting new folks. We enjoyed meeting section hiker Miker. We wish him the best in finishing his several year quest to finish next week.He will hike the 100 Mile and climb Katahdin. Congtadulations Miker!We also congratulate all NOBOs as they pass.

The guys have a full day tomorrow. Their first challenge is the Grafton Notch as they move into New Hampshire territory, unlike gaps in the southern Appalachias, notches are glacially carved straight up and straight down. To add insult to injury, the notches are typically filled with boulders and loose rock. Hiking is normally perceived as walking down a trail, what they will experience tomorrow has nothing in common with that. After the big bad notch, they will ascend to 4,023 feet to the top of Old Speck Mtn. We don't know how much further they'll push past Old Speck, but after that, they will soon drop into the Mahoosuc Arm and into the Mahoosic notch. Kurtis & I remember what a big pain in the butt it was.In the AT guidebook, it says ""Mahoosuc Notch:The most difficult/fun mile on the entire AT.""On the bright side of all this, some folks call the Mahoosic Notch ""nature's air conditioning"" as they will be walking on boulders that are planted above an underground river.

Budget’s resupply box from Debbie won’t show up until Monday. Budget’s bank card is also having issues, and he’s unable to withdraw money from any ATM. You can imagine this is a huge problem as most hostels require cash payment only. Their plans for Tuesday morning are still pending. Kurtis spoke with Budget today, and they hope to take a shuttle from The Barn Hiker Hostel to Pinkham Notch at the foot of Wildcat Mountain. Side note: Kurtis remembers this hike was his most fearful climb in New Hampshire. If our guys take this route, they’ll be hiking this section northbound. It doesn’t matter which direction they tackle it from, it’s gonna be a tough hike. The term “hiking” is relative, it’s more of a rock climb out of the notch. If they take it Northbound, they’ll be hiking back towards the The hostel they departed from. That way they won’t have to carry as much food, & will be able to shuttle back to Pinkham Notch & resume their southbound hike. We’re both very proud of these guys for using their heads to navigate the most difficult terrain on the AT. We hope that after this 21.1 mile section, they’ll be able to stay in some of the AMC (Appalachian Mountain Club) huts. Campsites in the white mountains are pretty much non existent.

Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545443,"Budget here, For the first time I am actually sitting at a computer terminal to look at my Journals and add some thoughts. This week has been a little different with Josh here, Buffalo's tooth and my knee. There's been a lot to think about. And that's the problem......First of all I got a great doctor yesterday at a doc-in-the-box. Dr. Cooper is a retired Army doctor and who else can you find that's more of an expert on hiking problems than someone who's seen soldiers for most of his career? Great guy and knows hikers. He prescribed a day of rest, ice, and some steroids. Seems to be working so far. Thanks Doc for the treatment and Deb for providing me with a health plan.Buffalo is presently making arraingements to get his tooth fixed down the line. The big question is where and when. My brother's wedding is coming up in a month and he could get it then or even as soon as a couple of weeks. Recuperating in an expensive northern motel is not a pleasant alternative. He's working on several alternatives. Film at eleven......The trail has been finished by blind people, wounded veterans, paraplegics and a five year old (Thanks for the pressure Buddybackpacker!). So there's no attempt for an excuse here. LB and I talked it over last night. The Trail is a mind game. Pain is something you live with. But on the trail its sometimes the ONLY thing you think about. Something small turns into something big while hiking. I miss the diversions of work, Church and especially family. Ever notice how you forget the pain you had when you get busy? Well, not on the trail. At 63 there will be more for me and Buffalo as we go on. We knew that going in.As you are sweating in one of the hottest summers ever we are concerned about winter. How late can we finish this thing? December in the Smokies isn't a nice thought for me but the longer we spend up here the later we are stuck down there. I want to be home for the Christmas holiday season. We have alternatives on that end too.When we pulled into the Yellow Deli on Tuesday we ran into GoGo for the first time since Katahdin.

Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545444,"Budget here, For the first time I am actually sitting at a computer terminal to look at my Journals and add some thoughts. This week has been a little different with Josh here, Buffalo's tooth and my knee. There's been a lot to think about. And that's the problem......First of all I got a great doctor yesterday at a doc-in-the-box. Dr. Cooper is a retired Army doctor and who else can you find that's more of an expert on hiking problems than someone who's seen soldiers for most of his career? Great guy and knows hikers. He prescribed a day of rest, ice, and some steroids. Seems to be working so far. Thanks Doc for the treatment and Deb for providing me with a health plan.Buffalo is presently making arraingements to get his tooth fixed down the line. The big question is where and when. My brother's wedding is coming up in a month and he could get it then or even as soon as a couple of weeks. Recuperating in an expensive northern motel is not a pleasant alternative. He's working on several alternatives. Film at eleven......The trail has been finished by blind people, wounded veterans, paraplegics and a five year old (Thanks for the pressure Buddybackpacker!). So there's no attempt for an excuse here. LB and I talked it over last night. The Trail is a mind game. Pain is something you live with. But on the trail its sometimes the ONLY thing you think about. Something small turns into something big while hiking. I miss the diversions of work, Church and especially family. Ever notice how you forget the pain you had when you get busy? Well, not on the trail. At 63 there will be more for me and Buffalo as we go on. We knew that going in.As you are sweating in one of the hottest summers ever we are concerned about winter. How late can we finish this thing? December in the Smokies isn't a nice thought for me but the longer we spend up here the later we are stuck down there. I want to be home for the Christmas holiday season. We have alternatives on that end too.When we pulled into the Yellow Deli on Tuesday we ran into GoGo for the first time since Katahdin.

Budget and Buffalo are staying at the Eckville Shelter tonight. They hiked 17 miles today, which brings them to 956.8 total. The shelter has electricity and water. Also two 50 gallon water tanks for showers, which are sun heated. I told Budget he needed to get to the shower first, before all the warm water ran out, and he was more interested in getting dinner cooked. He says there is a front coming in, which means cooler temps and rain. Wanted to get dinner done before the rain. He may skip the shower. No laundry service available. He says lots of Sobos did not stay at the shelter and are continuing their trek tonight, in order to be near a town to resupply tomorrow.

The Doyle is a dilapidated old 19th century boarding house that's been converted into a hiker hostel. Downstairs is a bar, upstairs are rooms in varying stages of decay! There are spooky drapes, and overly used mattresses fit for an abandoned asylum. You would walk into this place & immediately think ""This is definitely haunted!"" The owners are so nice, & 4 years ago they gave me & Kurtis their honeymoon suite looking over the Susquehanna. We wish we were back at The Doyle today as they were so kind to us! Kurtis has yet to find a better steak than the one he had at The Doyle, but...any steak is ""the best steak ever"" when you're thru hiking!
After walking to Duncannon, & visiting The Doyle, they still hiked a respectful 12 miles today. Budget did want to know how long the rocks lasted.

He rented a car to drive the 3 hours home. I also had a filling that had fallen out and the cold air was beginning to make it hurt. So rather than wait for it to become a problem on down the trail I opted to go with him. It has been strange coming home. Especially when not being able to conclude the trail. What has been good is spending time with my wonderful wife. I miss her so much. We were never meant to be apart. The time has been spent running from one dentist to another for a root canal. So many things needed to be fixed around the house in between too. Flue shots and my medicine refills were on the list too. My dog Effie went nuts and never left my side. Most hikers find it tough to come home because they don't want to leave. Neither do I.Buffalo saw many specialists and a physicians. I'm not sure if he's come to a conclusion other than we need to get back on the Trail. So we will do so tomorrow (Friday) afternoon. We have lost all of the hikers we were hanging with. It may take some time to catch up or we won't at all. We will really miss Jeremiah. Its our hope we can catch him. He was an asset to our crew. Sorry for those who I didn't get to see while home.

They broke their record again. Budget & Buffalo's hike will be 25.7 miles to Wilson Creek Shelter for today. It's an additional .6 mile round trip from the nearby stream. Water was an issue today. From Jennings Creek to Bobblets Gap Shelter (10 miles) there was no water. They hiked up a little over 800 feet to Fork Mountain this morning, walked down over 1,091 feet to a dried up Jennings Creek then had to hike 10 more miles until finally a reliable water source at Bobblets Gap Shelter. At 6:00 tonight they had 3 more miles to go. It's almost 7pm. I am writing this journal knowing they will probably arrive at Wilson Creek Shelter in the dark. Then they unpack, cook, crash, get up early with the sun, do it all over again tomorrow. They've been gone for 127 days, has had 12 zero's, with 738 more miles to go.

The Steinman's had coffee, & bacon egg cheese biscuits for them as I'm sure the guys started pounding immediately. 
Todd hiked along for awhile & got some pics made on top of Kelly's Knob. Todd said that he & Mary Heather brought up some subs for lunch, & BK asked if he could have more for later with a sad ""puppy dog"" look. I'm sure Todd knows a sad puppy when he sees one! He happily gave Buffalo & Budget the rest of their tasty sandwiches for supper at tonight's camp. Todd turned around from the Knob heading back to the car & the guys went on south...to Georgia.
Hiking further closer to home, mentally I think, is a huge difference compared to hiking in the 100 mile wilderness in Maine. Budget & Buffalo are at home here down south. All he & Buffalo can do is keep their eye on the prize. It's alot easier to hike a little longer each day knowing you're family & friends aren't far from you. We're all at the finish line waiting for ya guys! Buffalo & Budget have huge support from all of us. 
After a day with The Steinman's, I am sure there were laughs, good food, hugs, & exchanging of unforgettable moments they have had together. All of this is the perfect recipe that gives our guys something special. Something other Sobo's may not have. An extra pump in their step, maybe a little more drive to actually finish this thing.

""I could not be more proud of our Scouts in their performance during our camping trip to Stony Fork Campground in Virginia. Former troop members John, Thomas and Tom Young intercepted BK and Mr. Schiemann on the Appalachian Trail and brought them to our campsite to an enthusiastic welcome. They started hiking the Appalachian Trail in Maine during June and have now hiked over 1,600 miles, with less than 600 miles remaining between them and Springer Mountain, Georgia.
Our Scouts worked together in their patrols to practice cooking from scratch with fresh ingredients. They all worked well with their patrols and learned a lot in the process. Green Patrol prepared stroganoff (beef and vegetarian); Red Patrol prepared chili; and Gold Patrol prepared Irish stew. Everyone had the opportunity to sample everyone’s cooking. Later that evening, the Scouts prepared Apple Cobbler and Cherry Cobbler on the campfire. The next day, each patrol cooked their own breakfast of sausage and French toast before sending BK and Mr. Schiemann back out to the trail.

No stimulation what so ever. I'm so glad BK & Mark are doing this thing together. You know some folks hike from start to finish entirely alone.

""Buffalo had a migraine headache all night. He promptly regurgitated all the food he had eaten yesterday after his first sip of coffee. Suddenly feeling much better, he ate 4 slices of toast and the rest of the coffee. Meanwhile, uncertain of Buffalo's health, Budget and our host immediately started reviewing the day's plan to slack 26 miles. Instead of that hike, they decided we would be better off slacking the 23 miles we were going to do on Saturday. There are more road crossings in case Buffalo needed to be extracted. 
So we slack packed from Elk Garden to Damascus today for a total of 23 miles. Buffalo had no additional stomach issues. While we didn't step on mile post 1689.1, we did hike the distance; so our home bound distance is now less than 500 miles! The section we hiked today crossed the Virginia Creeper bicycle trail. Buffalo got to try out his new gaiters. We could see Grandfather Mountain. We crossed two section hikers, several day hikers, and a few bike riders. (Guide book miles 1696.1 to 1719.3)
The plan for Saturday will be to slack 26 miles from Dickey Gap to Elk Garden. And we will have hiked 1700 miles. (Guide book miles 1670.8 to 1696.1) And we will be looking for a trail magic cache we have been given clues to locate from LB.""

We started our 26 mile slack pack at 07:24 at Dickey Gap. We passed several deer hunters on the forest service road on the way to the trailhead. The trail was more rocky than I remembered. Also some parts were covered in layers of leaves which were slippery. We had walked 4 miles by 09:18, so we declared that we had hiked 1700 miles! I recognized Fox Creek trailhead after hiking the 1st 8 miles. From there it felt like we were on home turf since we have been on several scout camping trips in the Mt. Rogers recreation area. We had lunch at the Old Orchard shelter, since we needed the calories. We came across ponies several times, and they ignored us. There were quite a few cavalcades of people riding horses at Fox Creek and The Scales. Some people were also camping at The Scales near the corral gate. One jokingly asked us for the password; I responded with ""Appalachian Trail SOBO thru hiker"". We became instant celebrities as a small mob formed. They took pictures of us. And they offered us water, apples, and sandwiches; we topped off our water bottles and I accepted an apple. It is the 1st one I have eaten in over a month given my dental issues! There were a lot of day hikers and weekend campers so we spent time being trail ambassadors. Budget, always the youth educator, provided a group of young ladies information about the NC skyline of mountains they were viewing. The last 2 miles of the day were the best terrain to hike, as the sun set. John met us about a mile from the trailhead; he had his headlamp on but we had not gotten ours out yet. A half moon and Venus illuminated the sky and I observed some clouds that looked like a sword. Now that we have completed this section of mile 1670.8 to 1696.1, our actual miles are aligned back with the guidebook so we are actually at 1719.

Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551763,"Budget here. I figured I need to make this entry myself. Thanks to LB for all the wonderful entries she’s written for me.At 5:00am on Monday I realized I had to make a decision concerning the continuation of our Southbound AT hike. I had spent most of the night shivering in my 20 degree sleeping bag while wearing every piece of clothing I carried. I felt dangerously close to hypothermia. We were at Roaring Gap Shelter at 4000’. The temperature reading from the little thermometer on my pack read 18 degrees and the wind above us was clipping along around 20 mph. It sounded like a jet plane flying through the trees. The thought of entering the Smoky Mountain National Park and camping at 6000 feet altitude the next week quite honestly concerned me. It was only going to get colder. When I heard Buffalo stirring in his tent next to me I told him my concerns and floated the idea of suspending our progress until spring. He had heard me rustle through the night, understood, and agreed. Buffalo wanted to get home to check on his Mom and again another tooth problem had been aggravating him. Although I’m sure he would have wanted to continue on, the timing seemed right. Both of us made a promise to continue the last 240 (or 170 if the trails don’t open back up) miles in the spring. I couldn’t have asked for a better hiking partner than Buffalo. He has been a brother to me.A short text was sent out to LB for an extraction at Davenport Gap. She dropped everything and sprang into action. LB and Kurtis’s support has been an absolute blessing to us. She met us at 4:00pm and we were on our way home. The 15 mile walk out on Monday was meaningful and full of poignant signs. We ascended Max Patch on a clear and smokeless day to a beautiful display of the Smokey Mountains in their full glory. All the peaks were clearly visible and gorgeous. There’s no way I won’t be back to hike them. Also, when we started in Maine the one animal that made its presence known every day were red squirrels. Most mornings in the 100 mile wilderness started with a red squirrel chattering at our tents to get out of his neck of the woods. On Monday morning the woods were full of red squirrels (known as boomers in the south). We had not seen red squirrels since New Hampshire. We also got to say goodbye to Hummingbird and Cucumber. These were two fellow SOBO hikers we hadn’t seen since New Hampshire. Buffalo and I completed 1948.5 miles of the 2189.1 AT miles. Look for us in the future. It’s still considered a thru hike if finished in within 12 months. Too many people have helped us too. We’ll be back in the spring. There’s too many miles hiked to quit. We’ll even be nice to the newbie NOBO’s. More to come in the next few days","Roaring Fork Shelter

Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552159,"Budget here. LB's been on the mend from a horrible cold all week. On Monday Buffalo and I finished the last mile in Georgia. We ended up at Springer Mountain after a very hectic week. When we got back to the Trail last Wednesday it was our original contention to leave our cars at Springer and pay for a shuttle to Dick’s Gap and hike south. A hiker we know, Kremlin, said we were crazy to pass up a chance at using our vehicles to leap frog on sections so we could slack pack. Not carrying our winter gear helped us to put in extra miles each day. It got us to a warm hostel every night too.We hiked from gap to gap. Each day we moved cars around until we got to some horrible Forest Service Roads. The longest day was 23 miles and the shortest was 16. Sunday was miserable rain and cold. The roads got slippery for Buffalo’s Honda and my 1999 Silverado with 350,000 miles on it. Getting to Springer was very bittersweet because of the miles missed. The Smoky Mountains all the way to the Georgia/North Carolina line are shut down due to the fires. Heavy rains on the way have also made erosion the new villain in this tragedy. These sections of trails will not be opened for some time. Shelters, water bars, steps and outhouses have burned as well. The Forest Service and Park Service won’t let the ATC trail clubs in to fix the Trail until safety from damaged trees is guaranteed. The maintainers I’ve spoken with said that it may be late March or even maybe June before the Trail opens again. 2017 NOBOs will really be affected. Many of us have spoken of finishing the sections missed next summer. Life has a way of getting in the way of such plans but we’ll see. At least Buffalo and I finished our 2,000 miles. I’ll have more on my thoughts about equipment and our trek later. Thanks for the encouragement and support from everyone.","Top of Georgia Hostel

Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552441,"Gear ReviewOn buying used equipment,….DON’T DO IT! I wish I had just bought the new stuff. 2,000 miles is no place for used stuff. I replaced quite a bit.I am cold natured. As I’ve gotten older I’ve had a tough time with handling cold throughout the day and night. Buffalo never had the same problem. Some things may have worked for most people but for me they didn’t. Go Lite Quest 65 – Didn’t make it through the Whites. It tore up in the Mahoosic Notch from abrasion. The stitching was coming out everywhere. The torso adjustment kept on coming loose too. Drove me nuts If anybody wants it I left it at the AT Barn in Gorham.Osprey Atomic 60- This is an ok pack. I was in a pinch so I bought this in NH. This pack also had a torso adjustment. But this one actually worked. It also made the pack heavier. The hip belt cut me pretty good when the pack got many days of re-supply. In the end it was ok but I’d rather have the ULA that Buffalo had. Marmot Never Summer-0 bag- An epic fail. It got wet on top several times. I needed it and it failed. When I changed back to the 20 degree bag it wasn’t enough. Brrr.Western Mountaineering Alpinlite-20 Sleeping bag- It was used and I never knew if it had all the down it needed nor if it had been cleaned. I got cold when the temps got into the 20’s. I froze when it got colder than 20 even with much clothing on.Kelty Never Cosmic 20- Worked for me from ME to VA (June-October) . In Maine and the Whites it got into the 40’s and I stayed warm. This bag worked for me and I switched up because thought I needed too. It was too small for me too.Sea to Summit Thermo Reactor- I used this liner the whole way. Don’t know think it helped me stay warm but worked great as a sheet/liner.Sea to Summit Pillow- Worked great. Bad neck due to wrestling injury as a kid made it a necessity. Merril Moab boots- I had the worst blisters in Maine I’ve ever had in my life. The soles on these boots are pretty soft. The rocks beat up my feet. Never had a problem after I switched to Vasques.Vasque Breeze GTX Boots- Very comfortable and a known commodity to me. I could put them on right out of the box. They don’t hold up though. I had the soles on 4 pairs of boots chip off on some of the rockier sections. Pennsylvania ate one pair up alone. Around Dragons Tooth a pair less than a week old had a large section fall tear off of the sole.Komperdell Poles- Were broken by the time I reached Rangely. Bought a set of Leki’s and broke one within a week because I fell quite a bit. Made the finish with one of my older Leki’s from the 90’s and one of the new ones.Stove- Started with Pocket Rockets and finished with an MSR International gas stove. We could cook/simmer Pasta Sides better to maintain our personal weights. I lost 30 pounds and was far from fat when I left.Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 2- was an ok tent. Very light and held up for the most part. My only complaint was it didn't vent very well. It rained in my tent several times especially when camped near a body of water. Some of the poles got cracked but I fixed them quick with tape and wire ties. In the end I could find protection from the rain when I needed too. I used my tent much more than using shelters. Montbell UL Down Jacket- The only thing I'm real happy about. It kept me warm when I needed it. I only used it once during the day so that I wouldn'tget overheated.I'll have more to go over. Got to get back to work.","salisbury

Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552518,"More gear reviewsThermarest X Lite Air Mattress- Gotta tell you, I loved this thing. After a long day on the trail I found my mattress to be my refuge. Although used and bought off a gear swap page, the thing never let me down. Only when it got cold did it deflate a little. It is a necessity for the older hiker. The young kids looked at me blowing the mattress up and roll their eyes as they lay down on their cut to torso length foam pads. Not this fat boy! Arcterrex Shirt- Dried out much faster than the silky synthetic stuff. Ball Cap- Couldn’t keep the sweat from running down to my eyes. Hiked most of the trail in a dew rag. The ball cap worked great in the morning or evening when the sun was low in the sky and would blind me. REI Dry Bag- In the end I had all my stuff in these green stuff sacks. In a hard rain it was what kept my stuff dry. Even when some gas came out of my MSR stove it never penetrated the bag. Mountain Hardware and Etowah Gear pack covers. Neither kept the water out of my pack if it rained hard. I wound up putting a trash bag over my pack and then the pack cover.Cabela’s Rainy River Gore Tex rain jacket- We were in a drought most of the way but I can tell you that the thing never kept me real dry. Either I was sweating underneath it or the rain came through. It did protect me from the wind and never got a tear in sharp brush. By the time I got to Georgia I had to buy another rain jacket from Light Heart. It was a sauna suit. Bugle Boy Fleece shirt- My wife’s great uncle wore this while in a nursing home and I inherited it. It worked great. Although light it was a great layer under my puffy but over my long johns. I also felt honored to wear something from Uncle Thomas as he was crippled all of his life. He climbed Katahdin with me.Darn Tough Socks- I started with light weight Darn Tough and Heavier Smartwool Socks. I replaced the thinner Smartwool with heavier Darn Tough socks. Worked pretty good. I have a hole in the pair I wore the most. We’ll see if they replace it. Most outfitters wouldn’t.Sony Walkman- Yup that’s right! I carried this thing for night time use. I could drown out the snoring of fellow hikers or the coyotes yipping at night. It kind of kept me in the world no matter where I was. I listened to French Canadian radio in Maine and NPR most other places. Nothing puts you to sleep like BBC. One of my favorite nights was when Buffalo and I were camped on a pond on the NJ/NY border and saw the din of New York City while listening to an all night Sinatra tribute on WNYC. It also broke my heart to listen to the stations here at home while I walked past them. It only took 1 AAA battery for 16 hours of listening.","Home

Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552529,"WaterBecause the whole East Coast was in a drought, water was on our minds all the time. At first we carried as much as three or four liters at a time. As we went on we found that it was a little easier to find water on the trail rather than carry it. Water is the heaviest thing you will carry with food being the second heaviest item. Buffalo and I used two methods of treating water, Aqua Mira and a Sawyer Squeeze. We changed up only because we were concerned the filter may freeze.Most of the hikers we met used the Sawyer Squeeze. The Sawyer Squeeze was easy to use and could give you water immediately. Many of the younger hikers carried them atop their Smart Water bottles and treated the water as they drank it. When they got to a water source they would “Camel Up” by drinking a liter. I found this practice to work pretty good and I could get by many hours by doing this. They would also fill their bottles back up and go many miles further. Buffalo and I drank much more water than most and used the squeeze bags to fill our Smart Water and Gatorade bottles. We found the squeeze bags to be very disappointing. They would develop a leak around the spout rendering the bag useless as dirty water would drip into the bottle of treated water. Buffalo carried the two liter bags and usually they would develop leaks quicker because you put too much pressure on them. I believe you could carry the same Sawyer Squeeze for the entire trip if you took care of it. Backflushing a Sawyer is important and keeps a filter from plugging up. Buffalo developed a way of cleaning his Sawyer that worked very well. As you backflush your filter rap it on a table or something hard and it knocks loose the dirt. It got a bunch out that might have been trapped inside instead. In the end our filters were a year old when we started the trip so it became necessary to replace them. We moved to Aqua Mira when it got cold. This also coincided with the extreme drought in the Southeast. Getting water became painstaking in tiny seeps and brooks. Gathering water using cups or sandwich bags to be put in bottles, then filtering it was a very time consuming. The drops worked, were easy to use and didn’t have much aftertaste.Having a cup to dip out water is important. I used a plastic mac and cheese container Jeremiah gave me. I wanted to keep my real cup clean. We also carried a sandwich bag to lay in a seep. It took forever to fill up a bottle but the thing worked. It amazes me how hard we worked sometimes to load up on water only to find a stream a few miles further. We called this ""Water Anxiety"" or the fear of running out of water. Sometimes you just have to believe your AWOL guide or at least read between the lines. Unless something is written as a stream with a full droplet we didn't count on it. When the NOBOs quit passing us we lost a valuable asset for finding water. Guthook was great for checking water source dependability. Bu once the NOBOs dried up the latest water info also dried up. We would stop the occasional section hiker heading north and press him for water info. I was amazed how much water was left at trail crossings in New York, PA and New Jersey. It made the difference. This water dried up as we went further south and reappeared in Georgia. SOBOs are a small minority of thru hikers. Many folks don't know we're there.","Home

Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553268,"I have been asked many times since coming home as to why we started from the north and headed south and would I do it again? In a word, ""NO!""Starting at the hardest places on the Trail is especially hard on a senior hiker. I was sadly mistaken as to my condition and experience for such conditions. My feet got blisters early on in the 100 Mile Wilderness. The rough conditions of roots and rocks came right through the soft soles of my Merril Moabs. My feet weren't ready for it yet either. I pounded 18 miles the first day. Then struggled to make 10 thereafter.Its tough. You spend days trying to make good mileage on trails that are steep and sometimes the trail is straight up and hand over hand. Buffalo and I called it ""A Maine Mile"" because we could only average one mile per hour until Vermont. Again, I'm no rooky here. I thought I was ready and I wasn't. There's a great reason to start from the south. You will be ready by the time you get Maine and New Hampshire.Trail legs are a real thing. In the end you will feel cheated if you don't at least finish 18 miles a day no matter the terrain. I never felt I got the legs until we finished the Whites. I'd much rather have found them someplace else. As we started south we had a saying, ""walk like a NOBO"". This meant you eventually developed a sixth sense of stepping on the right place in the right way at the right speed. When I took my eyes off the trail in Maine I'd trip over something. The NOBO's all talked about how tough the mountains were in Georgia. By the time I got there I thought they were hills probably because I had 2000 miles before it. If I had my choice I would start in the middle in May. Its just warm enough. You get good terrain to start on. You will complain of PA but in the end its not that bad but each step you take will prepare you for New Hampshire and Maine. They are beautiful! Take the time to enjoy it.By flipping south at Harpers Ferry you can see the beauty of leaves changing in Virginia. The weather usually stays warmer into November and you are not dogged by an October 15 due date at Baxter State Park. The fires and drought sucked this year but this was unusual. By now you've probably made up your mind which way to go. For me, flip in Harpers Ferry starting in May. Good luck to all that hike this wonderful trail and take the time to enjoy it!","Home

My knee felt great and I wanted to put in some serious miles with an incoming tropical storm on Friday. After my hike up the Black Mountain Crest I figured I'd be ready to go. After just two hours of hiking with five miles and 1500' in elevation gain I stepped on a rock that tore twisted my ankle in a way God never intended. The full weight of my body and pack (with 6 days worth of food in it) twisted it so bad I could hear the bones crack. I screamed so loud I'm surprised nobody heard it.  
After regaining my composure I made a call to my son Kurtis to let somebody know my situation. He said to give it a try hiking on so I did. I've been taught enough First Aid to know I was going to have to end the hike. I also knew that nobody was going to haul me out either. I called my wife, Deb, and she immediately left work to come and meet me at Davenport Gap. So I headed back for Davenport Gap a good solid 8 miles away. After about a mile I ran into GSMNP Volunteer Tom Harrington. He was on a wild flower inventory hike and suggested hiking back out the way he came in only 5 miles away and he'd give me a ride to Davenport Gap. I took him up on the suggestion and he patiently followed me for 5 hours of painful walk out to his car. I was amazed at the number of NOBOs still making their way going past me. There were also many day hikers. 
I didn't have cell reception until Tom got me back to the road. We met Deb right where I gave told her. Within an hour we were at a motel in Bryson City. I still had to get my truck back from Fontana Dam. Fortunately I hurt my left ankle and the truck is an automatic. For first aid on the trail I tried to fashion a splint but I didn't have enough tape to finish the job. I did tighten my bootlaces very tight to restrict swelling and protect my ankle.

The usual crowd at Gooders Grove: NOBOs Sections and LASHs. Everybody had a tale and a name after 150 miles on the trail. It was good to be back in the hiker world.","Betty Creek Gap

We spent a lot of time at the Wayah Tower enjoying the views. We were pushing hard. When we got to the shelter there was no surprise when we found it full. So we set our tents atop a ridge and rode out one heck of a thunderstorm. A five year old was accompanying her mom from California on her NOBO trip. She was startled at the first sound of thunder but settled in great after that. They both beat us out of camp in the morning. That little girl was tough and so was mom.

There was a pretty good hiker crowd assembled along with a Memorial Day crowd that came in to ride the rafts down the Nantahala River. We got checked in to the bunkhouse and came back to the restaurant. Wow what a great meal! After showers and well fed we did a load of laundry. Its funny how hikers stood in the rain while others scampered for shelter. There were cars from every state in the southeast. Florida was well represented. The atmosphere was like that of a resort or cruise ship. People hanging out in the bars, stores or restaurants was a sensory overload even after only a week on the trail.","Cold Spring Shelter

Mark and I joined up with Tulsa and 2017 flipper, Bangles, for the long hike to Sassafras Gap Shelter. As we hiked we were joined by a bunch of folks with the same idea. After hearing of how much rain was on the way the four of us decided to head four miles further to Stecoah Gap and call for a hostel. Buffalo made a the call and even though the hostel in the book was full he sent us on to Wolfe Creek Hostel. We stopped at Cheoah for some awesome views. We ran into a small group that had a hiker down with beaver fever. He had drank untreated water from a spring and got very sick. They called 911 and the Robbinsville Emergency folks were on the way. We felt bad for the poor guy and thought how many times we were tempted to drink from the many pipes that brought water from the hillsides untreated. Now I'm glad we fought the urge.It was an awesome choice to go to Wolfe Creek. It was the childhood home of the owner, Lonnie, and right next to a restaurant. We ate well and enjoyed the shower and private rooms. On the Trail it always amazes me how fast you can put a plan together with people you just met.  The four of us settled in for the night with our laundry done, clean and with full bellies.

Tulsa was to finish his hike at Fontana Dam. He was looking forward to spending the night at the famous Fontana Hilton Shelter. We knew we had to shuttle our vehicles the next day. Buffalo's car was waiting for us at the Dam. We dropped off Bangles at the trailhead around 1:00 and walked on to Fontana. After a cold soda at Cable Gap boat launch we got to Fontana Hilton. Tulsa met us there and it didn't take much to get him to go back to Lonnie's place at Wolfe Creek. Hard to beat a hot meal, laundry, cable and a free shuttle.","Stecoah Gap

The weather was so crappy we got lost on the way back to Lonnie's and didn't get our car to Davenport Gap. Mark got a call from work to see if he could accompany his co-workers to visit an operation in Tennessee while there. So the next day he met his colleagues at Davenport Gap and dropped off another hiker that was staying with us at Lonnie's named Bandaid.

Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593952,"It was a little daunting entering the Great Smoky Mountain National Park again. I had broke my ankle there in 2017. It was dry and cold when I left for Thanksgiving 2016 and on fire when we returned in December 3 2016. The place has been my nemesis. But I was ready despite the floods being described on TV and the bad weather on the way. We were ready to get this place knocked out. Funny how so many folks plan their vacations around a trip here, ...and we just wanted to knock it out.
It was almost a 3000' climb out of Fontana to Mollie's Ridge. The views from Shuckstack were great despite the storm clouds gathering. On the way up Buffalo stopped me to ask if the log rolled over was evidence of bear activity. About the time I swung around to see what he was talking about when a bear 20 feet away stood up on his hind quarters to look at Buffalo. It was like a scene from a Benny Hill show. The bear just lumbered off. He was a pretty bear as black as coal with a shiny coat.
We hung all of our equipment on the bear cables just as I had been taught by Kurtis and LB four years before and settled into Mollies Ridge Shelter for the night. Then a section hiker came in around dusk and cooked his dinner in the bunk over me.  He wanted to know what all the fuss was about with bears? With 3 Shelters closed for bear activity and our close sighting all I could say was ""Yikes!"".","Fontana Dam

This leads to a very rocky surface that is making its way through the bottom of my shoes and hurts pretty good. Not big miles today but I thought we did pretty good. We managed to beat the rain to the Shelter. There we met many new folks that were Northbound and had kept together somewhat. I love when the young people get together and what they come up with. Some of the crew is: Mary Poppins ( a graduate student who is a LASH),  Sherpa (a very recent high school graduate NOBO), Mikey ( a very recent college graduate NOBO), and Narnar (a recent college graduate NOBO). A gal came in and did foot massages as trail magic. Mine were so beat up I let it go but she gave me some Lukor Tape which helped.
Later in the evening a group of ladies came in like a bunch of giggly school girls. They held reservations so we thought we'd get booted but we managed to find a place for everybody.  They were a bunch of fun and a few had never hiked before. As usual there were the jokes about farts and bears or getting lost on the way to the privy. I put in my headphones and pulled my hat over my eyes around 8:00 and when I awoke around 9:30 everybody was fast asleep. Shelters are like that most of the time.

Highway 441 is the only route that intersects with the Trail while on the AT so its the only re-supply area if you don't want to carry 6-7 days worth of food. Buffalo reached his son Joshua who was working as an intern in Johnson City and he joined us on Clingmans Dome and hiked with us some as well. Clingmans Dome is the highest point on the AT but all views were obstructed by fog. Joshua drove down to Newfound Gap and then walked up to meet us on the Trail to hike along with us. The bottom dropped out when we made it to Newfound Gap. It amazes me how dry it was in 2016 when we were set to cross the Smokies. There were fires everywhere on the road coming up from Gatlinburg. The food we packed was that Mountain House stuff that used little water. Now we have been rained on each day while here.
Joshua brought us into town for a motel stay. All of our stuff was wet. Our room smelled like a wet dog. He took us to a grocery store, laundry and then we went out for dinner. The town of Gatlinburg was nuts. It was like Myrtle Beach on a Saturday night. The streets were crowded and people were cruising the T-shirt shops, bars and restaurants. They came from everywhere.

We continued on to Tri Corner Knob Shelter only to find a bunch of the same NOBOs and Sections we left at Double Spring Shelter. Bear activity had closed the next shelter on and the constant rain had forced us all together. There were even Flip Flop hikers on their southbound hike. The place was packed so we set our tents up in the rain. The company was great but we knew  that we were going to get kicked out anyway so into the rain we went. It kept raining into the night.

Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593981,Last day on the trail to finish our Thru/Fire Miles. Today was bittersweet. It was a long hike to Mount Camerrer. The Trail was beat up due to horses and my feet took a beating. But almost like on cue the sun was out and the sky blue. I found the place where a year before I tripped and broke my ankle. It amazed us both how far I had to walk out with a broken ankle. Still can't believe I did it.It was a little melancholy to look back at Max Patch. This was the place we made the decision to get off the Trail in 2016. It took us two years to see every blaze. It was worth the wait. Instead of going to Davenport Gap we took the long cut to Big Creek Ranger Station to get Buffalo's car. We high fived and left. We had a long drive back to Wolfe Creek Hostel and then on to Fontana Dam to pick up my truck. It was over and we were glad it was over.,"Tri Corner Knob Shelter

Budget,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594880,"Buffalo and I finished 165 miles in a little more than two weeks. Some of these miles we had done before but in order to tie it all together we just did it again so that's why the counter is off some. Because the ATC had told us to go on around the fires in 2016 they went ahead and gave us our Certificates long ago. But we never felt completed until we finished every step. Now it finally feels we can take the credit for finishing even though it took us almost two years.
When we got off the Trail for Thanksgiving 2016 we thought we'd come back right away. Honestly with my body weight so low I was having trouble keeping warm. There was an excellent job opportunity I wanted to apply for as well. Buffalo was concerned about his Mom. She was battling cancer along with other problems in what turned out to be her last fight.  The fires of 2016 made the final decision for us. We got back on the trail but could only finish those sections that were left open. On December 2, 2016 140 miles were closed in the South. But we still managed to come back December 2nd to Dicks Creek and hike to Springer.
Buffalo stayed in Ohio for a year until his Mom passed away and he finished dealing with the final closing of her estate.  I made an attempt in June 2017 but broke my ankle on the second day. It took me another 6 months to be able to hike again. We knew the risk of never really finishing when we left in 2016. There is a lesson there for those who might get off the Trail, you may or may not get the chance to get back on. Its easy to get back on the conveyor belt of a normal life but its hard to get back off.
Many things changed since 2016. Both Buffalo and I put on about 30 pounds since we left in 2016. We expected to eat like we had in our 2000+ mile journey in 2016. We did not need the food. We never got that hungry. I think I put on weight this time. It was summer and we probably brought too much clothing. I constantly hit ""the wall"" on long climbs. Our mileage was pretty good for a couple of old guys but I never felt I had the stamina I did when I was a Thru. One of the days we hiked I tried to keep up with 2017 Flip Flopper, Bangles. Also as a senior hiker, she had already hiked some of the Maryland and West Virginia sections with friends this spring too. She still had her Trail Legs. I was working on getting mine back and it just about killed me. Don't know if it was the time off or the fact that I'm two years older that made the difference. I'll continue hiking to find out.
Hiking North this time we got to be a NOBO if only for a very short time. I couldn't believe the NOBOs leaving so late. Many were kids just out of school. By the time we got out of the Smokies I think many had been culled out. I believe I saw one of the AT tags on the NOBOs to be over 2700. That's 2700 people heading North. I also met several LASH hikers who were taking summers during graduate school over a period of three years to complete the Trail. I really appreciated getting a new prospective on these groups. They never took the Trail too seriously. Either they made it or not. It was refreshing from the driven SOBO I was in 2016. We had lots of fun together. I hope they make it.
Thanks to Tony Nussman who started off with us this year and helped me train for it. You are a great hiking partner.
Thank you to GSMNP volunteer Tom Harrington who walked me out of the Park when I broke my ankle.
Thanks to my former daughter in law LB for keeping up my journals in 2016. You did a great job of it. I hope you find what you are looking for out there.
Thanks again to Eric Mendoza (Godzilla 2008) and my son Kurtis (Almost Eagle 2012) for giving me the inspiration to even start on this thing. And especially Kurtis for providing support and advice through the entire hike. You can leave the Trail but it never leaves you.
Thanks to all the Trail Angels who were there for us (And there aren't many for SOBOs!), my dad for driving me back to the Trail plus staying healthy for six months, my brother Bill who picked me up twice (once for risking his life on the Palisades Parkway) and for marrying a great lady then inviting me to the wedding (It drove me hard through New England to make the wedding on time), and of course to my lovely wife who said, ""Yes"" three times as I started on this journey each time. 
Most especially thanks to my trail brother Buffalo. Who put up with me for 2200 miles. It just wouldn't have been as much fun without you my friend. 
So? Am I now a Thru hiker, LASH, or Section hiker? In the end it doesn't matter I guess. Its the journey that counts.",,A life well spent,"Jun 21, Thu",0
