Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521321,"In 1976 my brother and I hiked through Mahoosuc Notch, up over Mahoosuc Arm ending the day at Speck Pond where we met two NOBO thru hikers. They talked to us about the Appalachian Trail and about the hike that they started in Georgia at Springer Mountain. They showed a passion for the Appalachian Trail, the beauty of the Appalachian Mountain chain, the states that the trail winds through and the difficulty of a 2181 mile hike. From that moment on, I was hooked and have had a yearning to hike the AT that has only grown stronger with each passing year. 
Somewhere in my 50's, I realized that if I didn't make plans to hike the trail soon, I never would, and would look back on my life with the emptiness of a dream unfulfilled. For a number of years, my target has been 2017 at which time I would retire from a career in computer technology. This past year the company that I work for announced that it was going to be acquired by Dell. Shortly after the announcement they offered me a voluntary separation, which I prefer to think of as an Appalachian Trail support agreement. My last day at work will be March 31st.
While it's going to take me a few months to prepare for a SOBO thru hike, I look forward to taking the first step of a life long dream. On June 28, 2016 I will climb Mt Katahdin, and begin to focus my attention on the 100 mile wilderness and what lies beyond.","

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539924,"Following my last day at work on March 31st, I had great expectations on two fronts - prepare for my AT thru hike with the hope that I would be close to being in great hiking shape, and wrap up a big section of the siding project that I have been working on for a number of years. I started a training regiment earlier in the year running 4-6 miles 4-5 times a week, but got shin splints for the first time in my life (I think it was a result of the statins I was taking). That stopped my running, but I was still able to hike and walk, so I started to take Wilson and Harley on 5-6 mile walks with my fully loaded backpack. Also went on a few hikes along the way including the Lahaina-Pali Trail and a hike thru the Haleakala Crater on Maui, along with a hike up Mt St Helens. I usually gauge my hiking shape by how much jiggle I have in my butt and belly - was hoping to have close to none, but I'm still packing a whole lot of jelly butt. Tomorrow, June 28th I start my AT hike with 8 days of food to get thru the 100 mile wilderness. Will post an update after that stretch from Monson.","

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541077,"Walking on the happy side of misery
(Borrowing a phrase from Model-T)
I flew into Bangor Maine where I met The Solar Wolf at the airport. He is a flip flopper ( started In Georgia, hiked to Irwin TN, now hiking south to Irwin). Shared a taxi to hotel, shuttle next day to Baxter State Park, and stories. He asked what cell coverage I was using, said that att has the worst coverage on the trail. I told him I didn't care since I planned to use my cell in towns only.
Got to Baxter later than expected and didn't start hike up Mt Katahdin till 11:45. Started out on nice wooded trail for about a mile and half, then turns up steeply where trail is a steam when rains are heavy, eventually you get to bolder field and the climb is a slow climb pulling your self up thru the rubble of rock. At the bolder field started to get windy and in a cloud with visibility at 30-40 feet and thunder in distance. Got to table lands and eventually the summit at 4:30-5, had a snack, took photos and worked my way down. My legs felt heavy and tired from climbing Mt St Helens on Sunday, which made Mt K more difficult. Got back to camp at 7:30, warmed up cassoulet for dinner and went to sleep. Woke up to heavy rain a few times. Up at 5:30 and shuttled my stuff to a covered table to cook breakfast and pack, and to keep out of rain. Had to register at ranger station and started hiking south at 7:30 in moderate rain. Passed Muffin and She Wolf in bog putting on deet since mosquitos were bad. I stopped and did the same. Should have put on gators too but wanted to get going. Didn't put on rain gear - too hot. Got soaked hiking and fell in the river at the second ford, feet only but boots were soaked. Stopped at abol bridge for lunch and hot cocoa. 13 miles in to a 20, feet were starting to hurt along with shoulders on my way to Rainbow Lake camp. Changed socks at that point and found that my feet were getting raw. Did pass under eagle 8' up in branch above me along a river. Trail most of day was muddy rooted and rocky. Slipped on roots twice and went down. Views were lovely most of day of swamps, ponds, lakes and rivers. Sun did try to come out with no success. At camp around 6 and started to set up tent in light rain. Started downpour half way through and tent filled up with water. Had to sponge out, but still wet along with some of my stuff. Rained on and off thru the night, but the sound of the loons on the lake was beautiful. They woke me up at 1:00 am and sometimes sound like coyotes. Slept ok, packed up wet tent to clearing sky's and hiking by 7. Slippery roots and rocks for most of the day, but wild life started to come out. A lot of toads, frogs, snakes, birds. Also a lot of moose dung, but no moose yet. Midway thru day, noticed I was getting thigh chafe. Later butt chafe too and my feet were starting to really hurt. Eventually nipple chafe started too. I had been sweating so heavily that salt was collecting in my clothes. Met a few hikers who told me about White House landing, a bunk house that can be reached by boat, and owner will pick you up at dock if you call. It would make my 18 mile day into a 21, but I thought it would be worth it - shower, laundry and dry out my stuff. At 16 miles the dogs (feet) were barking. With every extra mile they got worse and at 21 they were chewing on my ankles. At dock turned on cell - no service. I was done at that point but decided to hike the extra mile to a spot across the lake from White House. Called across the lake - nothing. Did that 5 times, tried my cell again - one bar in and out and called Bill, the White House owner - voice mail. About 5 minutes later I heard a boat start and bill came across to get me. At the dock at the landing I was greated by Trapper, a big lovable 11 month old black lab. Some of you know that I love dogs, but especially labs. Trapper just wanted to lick my face, which ordinarily would be fine, but I was covered in deet and didn't want him to get sick from it. Once up on the dock, Trapper got a few minutes of belly rubs. This was a savior and a turning point for the remainder of the 100 mile wilderness. Showered, dried my stuff out, slept in a comfortable bunk, and started the day with eggs, bacon, English muffin followed by pancakes - and coffee of course. Next day's hiking were hard but glorious. The landing sits on a beautiful point on the lake. I could picture wasting a few days there just staring out at the water.","Mt Katahdin

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541573,"With a great breakfast to get me started I was ready to get started. I had hung my tent on a line to dry the previous evening, washed my hiking clothes and hung them too. Tent dry but not clothes so I moved them down to the dock in the sun while I ate breakfast. With everything dry, I was packed up and ready to go at 8:30. Bill shuttled me back to the dock on a calm flat lake. Had a chance to talk to Bill for a while and learn a little about the landing. Hiked the 2 tenths snack to the AT to a sunny morning. Bill let me know that a storm was moving in, so I wanted to stay in a lean-to if possible tonight. The trail to Cooper Brook Fallls is nice, some roots and rocks, but mostly loamy and piney trail - just what I needed. My feet and shoulders were still sore but not too bad. It was a glorious day to be hiking in the wilderness. There was some rolling up and down with one small mountain to go over and a slight up hill climb to Cooper Brook. Met a young couple about 10 miles into the day and told them about the landing. He asked how far - about 10 miles from here, weather for the business card pinned to the tree under the MATC landing sign. He replied ""we are going farther than that"". She gave him a cold look and replied "" no we are not"". Something going on there, started walking again and said have a nice day. Later met two young gals that were section hikers who started in Vermont, Fiddle Head and Fainting Goat. They were cute with a really nice smile. The were hiking in skirts and used over size cat socks with the bottoms cut off as gators to keep the trail crud from getting in your shoes - will have to remember that one. Ate lunch at a dirt road with a bridge crossing a stream. Sat on a large rock over looking the water, nice. Before Cooper Brook Falls I crossed a number of streams and saw a number of dragon flys with electric green and turquoise bodies and deep black wings that were more like butterfly wings vs the traditional dragon fly wing. They were beautiful. The last 4 miles to the lean-to were good, but my feet and shoulders were starting to ache more and was glad to get to the falls and find a spot open for me in the shelter. Got there around 4, got settled in with my pad and sleeping bag, and went for a swim in the pool at the base of the falls along with a bunch of Nobo's and a few others staying at the camp site. Got dinner ready, ate and was in my sleeping bag by 8. Hung my food on the mouse lines in the lean-to, but no mice. Almost a perfect day on the AT.","white house landing

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541674,"It rained hard during the night so I was glad to have been in a lean-to instead of my tent. Forgot to take Advil before hitting the sack and didn't sleep all that well. Hips are sore and rolled around on in my sleeping bag all night. Up at about 5:30, oatmeal and coffee for breakfast and out on the trail by 6:45. The day was looking to be nice, but showers was in the forecast. The trail was nice up to East Branch lean-to which is where I stopped for lunch. Met a father and son hiking the wilderness along the way. Dad was parched with 84 degrees and sunny at this point. I gave him a two day supply of Nuun tablets and said the he needed to replenish his electrolytes. I learned that lesson hiking the Wonderland trail a few years ago. At East Branch I met Paladin, a Nobo and talked to him for a while. Had sardines for lunch, some chapotle lime beef jerky, dried mango slices and almonds, washing it down with Nuun. I found that sardines and the chapotle jerky isn't a good combo, keep repeating spicy sardine for a few hours. Thinking about that I slipped on a root and went down. I've been falling from slippery rocks and roots about two to three times a day. It did power me up the 2500' over White Cap Mtn though. Weather started to change on my way up White Cap. This is a pretty big mountain with krumholtz at the top. Climbing White Cap was a chore with endless stone stairs for a good portion of the way. You would climb up a section and the trail would divert left or right to more stairs. This happened a gazillion times. Eventually the trees grew shorter and disappeared after a while, but as the trees transitioned away, the wind grew stronger and it was getting cold. Clouds were moving in starting to obstruct the view. It was getting late in the afternoon so I hurried down the other side of White Cap to Hagas Gulf and the Sidney Tappan camp. Two gals in there 20's were there - the swimming girls. Started to set up my tent and yes, it started to rain again. My timing hasn't been great so far for this activity. This time it remained a light rain and I was able the keep most of my stuff somewhat dry. Swapped stories with the swimming girls while I made dinner. Called it a night with the sun going down at 8:30 and slept moderately well.","Cooper Brook Falls

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/541888,"It was a little windy during the night, but no rain. My hips and feet are pretty sore so I find that I roll around a lot I my sleeping bag during the night when the ach wakes me up. I find that I wake up with the morning light which is about 4:30 and stay in my bag for another 1/2 hour or so. I had my bag and pad packed up and breakfast just about down when the swimming girls rolled out of their tent. They are fun to talk to, and ended up leaving camp a good 1/2 hour later than I planned. I had a 19 mile day planned that started out pretty easy, a 7 mile down hill to a river ford. Weather was nice, trail pretty good and that first segment went great. Before I got to the river I passed a stream with a beautiful waterfall and started to pass a lot of day hikers. Turns out that this little stretch is a popular day hike and it is the 4th of July weekend. I put in my water shoes and crossed the river, thought about pulling water since the next 12 miles were a long climb over three peaks - Chairback, Third, and Forth. Looked at the map and it showed multiple springs along the way as well as a lean-to site (which always has water). Started the uphill and the day was starting to get warm. Fortunately the black flys and mosquitos were not a problem. I've been trying to lay off the deet, the stuff works on bugs but is gross. Came to the first spring - dry, 45 minutes later the second spring - dry. Starting to get worried since I only had about a quart left and started to meter my intake. The upcoming shelter should have water - it didn't. Ok, my map shows that there is a stream that supplies a pond 3-4 miles from my destination, but that's after going over Chairback, Third and Forth peaks. I was mostly up cChairback at this point, so no issue there. Third wasn't a bad clime, but it was getting on in the afternoon and it was hot. Forth was a bear, steep, rocky and difficult. I was running out of energy and didn't want to eat anything since I didn't have enough water to wash it down. I pushed on and finally, the stream, a good strong downhill flow of water that was cold. I filled up my water containers and ate a snack. There was another couple there at the same time going north. On to Cloud Pond. 1 1/2 miles from the lean-to I came across a Nobo camped on the side of the trail. He said that he stopped by Cloud Pond and it was taken over by two youth groups hiking the 100 mile wilderness. No room for a tent or in the lean-to. My heart sank, I was ending what was a very long and hard day and might not have a place to sleep. It was getting into the early evening now and decided to go to Cloud Pond anyway. The pond is 1/4 mile off the AT down a rocky and marshy path. Got there and the place was packed. Walked up to the shelter and asked, got room in there for one more guys? The leader of the group said, make room for this hiker guys and they all moved over to give me a spot at the end of the lean-to. Set up my pad and bag, got more water to make dinner and ate sitting on my bag wearing my headlamp since it was now dark. Brushed my teeth, got in my bag and listened to the 12 year old, two kids over coughing into the misty cool air of the shelter. Hips and feet even more sore due to a long hard walk made for a lousy night sleep and every time I woke up, the kid was coughing. Great.","Sidney Tappan Campsite

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542691,"Sorry for not staying up to date on blog. My aunt is turning 95 and my cousin is throwing her a party on July 24th. Got the invite one week before I flew out to Bangor. I've been rushing and passing my days off to get to a place in New Hampshire where I can get a shuttle to Manchester to rent a car to drive to the party. Haven't seen my aunt for 20 years or so and want to make it. Got up around 5:15 at cloud pond lean-to with the kids in the shelter still cutting logs. Cooked breakfast, oatmeal and coffee, and was out by 6:30. Day starts with a climb up and over Barren Mt, which gives you a nice view looking south. The climb down Barren was steep and long and puts you into Wilson Valley where there are a number of shale ridges and a series of magnificent waterfalls. I met happy feet, a forty-fifty year old woman who is also a Sobo. We hiked on and off together and took a break in the afternoon at the last shelter before Monson. Pulled water, ate something and was ready to go. Happy Feet was talking to a Nobo at the shelter and asked me to wait for her at the road for the shuttle into Monson. I didn't say yes or no. It was getting on in the afternoon and i didn't want to get into mondo too late. This was another long 18 miles for me and I was tired. Got to the road before 7 pm and waited 15 minutes before I called Shaw's boarding hours fora shuttled ride - no Happy Feet yet. Shuttle arrived at 7:30 and when I was putting my pack in the SUV happy feet waked up - good timing. Shaw's is run but two past thru hikers - The Poet and Hippy Chick, both very nice. Showered, ate a dinner of trail food and headed for bed. Bunk room had me, Hsppy Feet, and Swiss Miss. Swiss Miss is a section Nobo and very nice gal. She talks with an Irish accent and learned English in Ireland. Swapped stories for a while and called it a night. Tomorrow would be another long day with a few chores before the trail. Throughout the wilderness, I past a lot o ponds and lakes, they were beautiful, but what made them really special was the chorus of loons and frogs every night. It was magical. There were toads everywhere and a lot of garter snakes. Every once in a while a snow hare and grouse with chicks, but no moose yet.","Cloud Pond Lean-to

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542703,"Got up around 6 am and got ready for a hugh breakfast of coffee, eggs, home fries, bacon, and an endless supply of blueberry pancakes. It was great and a lot of fun chowing down with a bunch of thru hikers. Out to the post office to pick up my mail drop after doing the laundry packed up and was ready to shuttle back to the trail before 10:30. Shaw's is a thruhikers staple coming into and leaving the 100 mile wilderness. Weather was good and trail looke somewhat level with moderate climbs to Moxie Bald, so I was intent on the 18 miles. Powered by the breakfast I was moving pretty well until I hit a few sections with endless round boulders. They were ankle busters and really had on my feet. Picked up my first blister here, a big painfull one on my left heel. Had a river ford along the way where I pulled water and met Mr Potato Head, a 61 year old Sobo with the same birthday as mine. He is a tall thin man and decided that he does' like hiking alone. He also fishes along the way and has been eating fresh caught trout. Got to the shelter at 6:30 so it ended being a fast 18. Set up my gear in the lean-to, cooked dinner and carried it down to the lake, which was absolutely gorgeous. Powder Puff and Hunger Pains were there soaking there feet. I did the same looking out over the Lilly pads on the lake edge. There were a number of flat rocks right there perfect for sitting and enjoying the view. While eating dinner a beaver swam by munching on the Lilly pads, another special moment on the AT. Saw a frog eat a moth as the sun set and called it a night. At this shelter, the mice were active and acrobatic. Watched them try to navigate the mouse sheild contraptions in the shelter during the night. My food bag was ok, but one mouse got to Hunger Pains bag. I sent him 20 feet by smacking him with my headlamp. Not a great night sleep, but a great day. On to Caratunk tomorrow.","Monson

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542708,"Didn't sleep well due to the active mice. There was a channel 6 inches from my head that was a mouse highway and kept waking to the scratching noise they make. Up with the light and ready to hit the trail by 6:45. Checked the lake one more time and saw Powder Puff and Hunger Pains still sawing logs in there tents. Just before leaving met two retired marines, hiking with no shirts, very fit and covered with tattoos. talked for a few minutes and the took off. They are much faster then me, but take a number of breaks. Ran into them in and off thru the day. Started the day with a climb over Moxie Bald, a 1500' climb which was not bad first thing in the morning. Down the other side of Moxie, saw the marines at a river crossing. The bright turquoise dragon flies with the black butterfly wings were there, and I stopped to camel up. It was a hot muggy day and I was drinking a lot of water. Next was a climb up to pleasant pond, which rolls up a series of five sholes and seemed to go on forever, for another 1500'. The initial downhill was steep and was hard on my knees and legs. Had lunch just past the top on the downward side which wasand saw the marines again. 7 miles to Caratunk mostly downhill with some good trail. I was moving pretty well but tired 4 miles out and caught my right boot toe on a root growing over a rock. Before I knew what was going on, I was flying through the air head firsts until a big mossy rock stopped me. Laid there for a minute to figure out if I was hurt or ok. Slight bump and scrap on my forehead, and a very stiff neck, but ok. This was my worst fall yet, which seems to happen about twice a day - slippery rock or root and you are down. Pushed on a fairly level trail to Caratunk which is right on the trail. Walking into town stopped at the first B&B run by Paul, a past thru hiker who hiked the AT and the PCT multiple times. Paul is a soft spoken man and a great conversationalist. He made me feel right at home. His B&B was filled with a ton of things that he collected over the years and was really cozy. Showered and got ready for a drive out to a restaurant for dinner with a few other Sobos. A young couple was taking a lazy hike south with the goal to complete the AT in 365 days - wow, I plan on 4 1/2 months. Dinner was a big burger, frys and a big green salad - fantastic. Back to the B&B by 8:30, bought a few Good-to-go bars (which I love, the apricot nut especially) did a few chores and went to bed. I had been feeling worn out during the day and understood why when I started coughing during the night. The curse of the 12 year old at cloud pond lean-to.","Moxie Bald Lean-to

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542719,"Paul made a great breakfast of eggs, bacon, hash browns and French toast with fresh ground coffee made with a press. It was fantastic. Breakfast was at 7 which timed really well to catch the ferry across the Kennebec River which was just a 10 minute walk from Paul's. The Kennebec is a river just too deep to ford, so the ATC hires a local to ferry hikers back and forth with a canoe. Ferry time is 9-11 until later in July when more Nobos are coming through, then it expands in the afternoon from 1-4. I was at the ferry right at 9 with one other hiker at the river already on the north side. The south side was piled up with about 10 Nobo's, but I would be on the first ride going south. It was raining which persisted throughout the day with patches of calm, heavy rain and thunder. The trail for the day was a mild uphill climb but due to the rain it was really slippery. There were a series of cascading waterfalls to the left of the trail for most of the first 4 miles and they kept pulling me off trail a few tenths of a mile to see. Really nice. I stopped for lunch at a pond during a dry period in the day just before passing a beautiful sand beach on the lake. I got to Carry Pond Lean-to around 4 and had a lot of time to horse around. Eric, another Sobo that stayed at Paul's B&B got in at 5:45, which about when I was making dinner. In the bag around 8 with a chest cold coming on pretty strong. Feeling really tired. Didn't sleep well due to coughing fits I would have through the night and got up the next day tired. Tomorrow would be a really hard day with big climbs up and over the Bigalows.","Caratunk

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542732,"It rained hard throughout the evening on and off with a hard rattling on the metal roof of the lean-to. There was a beautiful chorus all night of the loons and the frogs that would start up during the periods of calm. Since I was awake from time to time, I could see the mice going for the food bags on the mice hangers, with no success. I wake with the light in the morning and the first call of the birds which is about 4:15 or so and snooze a little longer until 5:30. More coughing during the night and feeling really sluggish. I think that I may be running a low grade fever. Out hiking at 6:45, but moving slow. Start out with a 500' easy climb over Roundtop Mtn, down and up over another mound on my way to Little Bigelow Mtn. Little Bigelow is a 2000' climb and it was wearing on me. I met Gary a Nobo in his fifties along the way and he said that he just slacked packed the section of trail between Stratton and Rangeley. I hadn't planned on stopping in Stratton but a slack pack was sounding pretty good to me. With a slack pack, you work with a hiker hostel where they drop you off at one location at the start of the day and pick you up at a designated location at day end, you estimate how long it will take and meet at that time. They lend you a day pack so you only carry what you need for the day and leave your tent, sleeping bag and other stuff behind. It's the difference between carrying 10 lbs vs 40. So, my mind was made up, into Stratton tomorrow to the Stratton Motel. Ate lunch half way up Little Biggelow at a lean-to. That spot had a beautiful stream with a series of small waterfalls and pools between them - perfect for a swim, but I had to press on. The climb up the remainder of Little Biggelow was ok, but once on top it rolled up and down for almost two miles. Finally down the other side to Stafford Notch. Are a snack there and then started up Avery Peak. This climb was beautiful with large angular rocks moss covered held in the tight grasp by roots of pine trees. The moss was a magnificent emerald green and I felt like I was approaching the hall of a mountain King. The climb up Avery was a steep 2000' and relentless. The top was in a cloud so no view, but the stunted trees and bushes at the top were beautiful in the mist of the cloud. Avery is the east peak of Bigelow Mtn and the camp was a steep 250' climb down a pile of rock slabs. Very slow and tricky when wet. At the camp finally and went to the care takers hut - locked up, so I set up my stove in a short alcove in the front of the building and planned to leave most of my gear there. Walked down the hill to the tent sites and set up on a wooden platform next to Alex and Clara, a young couple in there early 30's from Switzerland. We talked for a while and then called it a night. I coughed all night long and found I was loosing my voice. In bed at 8:20 to a cold and dripping rain. I slept ok, but my hips and legs were sore from the climbs. Would wake up sore and role a bit to get more comfortable. At 4 had to pee really bad so I slipped out in the rain for a minute. Back in the bag, slept in until 6 am. Still dripping rain.","West Carry Pond Lean-to

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542756,"It is a common practice for thru hikers to sleep in you wet clothes, it drys them out so you start with dry clothes for the day. I had been ding this for the past number of days and it works pretty well. Going back to the second day of my hike, I developed bruises and open sores on my shoulders from my pack straps rubbing against the top of my shoulder. Since I hadn't taken off my shirt for awhile I didn't know what was going on with the wounds. Getting up, I noticed that my shirt was stuck to my left shoulder and decided to figure out what was going on when I got to Stratton. The Swiss couple on the next platform over were up before me, packed up and left quickly. They has a large dog with them, which was quit sweet. I got up, hiked up the hill 100 yards to the caretaker cabin, boiled water for oatmeal and coffee and went back down to pack up my tent. The base tent was fairly dry, but the fly was soaking wet. I tied the fly to the outside of my pack after eating breakfast and started to hike up and over the West Peak of Bigelow Mtn. I was still in a cloud going down the steep 1/2 mile climb down toHorns Pond lean-to and found Alex and Clara in the day use lean-to eating breakfast trying to keep out of the rain. I stopped for a break and talked to them for about 20 minutes. Clara grew up in Texas and traveled/worked all over the world including Tacoma WA. We both love Mt Rainier. I was still hunger and ate a Good-Togo bar. My legs were really tired today and heavy from the hard climb the previous day and started the steep hike down with Alex and Clara. They don't have a phone and we're hoping that I would help them get a shuttle ride to the Stratton Motel. The climb down was steep, slippery and slow, but I ended up going much faster than Alex and Clara. I made it to the road before noon, dumped my pack on the ground and called Ben at the Motel for a ride. Ten minutes later I was headed into town. I told Ben that Alex and Clara were behind me, had a dog and needed a ride. He said that he would go back to pick them up after dropping me off. The Stratton Motel was full for the night but I made plans with them to slack pack the section between Stratton and Rangeley, and wold stay at the motel the next night after the first segment of three slack pack days. I stayed at the Inn next door, dryer out my tent, did laundry at a laundromat and took a good look at my shoulder. Two sores on my left shoulder was infected and there was a flap of skin still attached at one end on one wound. Washed it well, treated it with am antibiotic cream and put bandages on them. Went downstairs in the inn and had an Elk burger and a salad - not bad, worked at drying out my stuff and called it a day.","Avery Memorial Camp

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543025,"On the agenda for today is a slack pack of Crocker Mtn, which has a profile similar to Mt Si in Washington, 3500' of elevation gain and close to that in elevation loss over a span of 8 miles. I was up around 5:30 and started to pull my gear together since I spread it all over the room the previous day to dry everything out. The plan is to carry my gear over to the Stratton Motel and leave it with Ben and his crew while I use a day pack to hike Crocker Mtn. A room would be available by the time I get back from the hike. My tent and other equipment dried out nicely and when packing everything up I realized that my camera was missing. I tore my pack apart, no camera. I tore the room apart, no camera. I moved the beds, it wasn't there. I was pannicked and getting sick to my stomach. I stepped outside the room and realized that I didn't operate the lock on my room properly, bumped into the cleaning woman and asked her if anything ever disappears from the rooms. She said that she has worked there for years and nothing has ever disappeared. My images of the start of my thruhike were gone. In an act of desperation, I found Ben from the Stratton Motel and asked him if I happened to drop my camera when I put my pack down in his office when I registered for the slack pack yesterday. He said no, but he did go back to pick up Alex and Clara at the trailhead yesterday and they found a camera at the trailhead and think it's Wilson Wilson's. They looked thru some of the images and Clara recognized Mt Rainier in the first few and told Alex, I think this is Wilson Wilson's camera. At that point Alex came out of his room, went back in to get the camera and gave it to me. I was elated thanked him a dozen times and gave him a hug. Clara was in the common room in the hostel, I found her and gave her a hug too. I told them that we should have dinner together that night, packed up what I needed for the day hike and was off to the trailhead with Ben. The day was dripping rain, but with a light pack, the climb seemed easy to the first of the double peaked Crocker Mtn. About half the way up the first climb, I was thinking about an unfortunate situation with my family, and the fact that my brother would not be going to my Aunt's 95th party. I was thinking about my Aunt, my cousins and my brother and was overcome with grief. My chest tightened, I stopped walking, my breathing got difficult, and the I could not breath. Not a wheeze, nothing. I thought, relax, started to see dots, leaned forward on my poles, relax... And was able to take a straigned breath, followed by another and then finally a full breath. Well, that was something new - had never experienced that before, and said to myself, no more thinking about the family, focus on the trail and something more cheerful. I don't know if it was the emotion of the day, a reaction to the medication I was taking for my chest cold or what, but I did not want to go through that again. I hiked on to the top of the north peak, pushed on to the south peak and ran into a troop of French Canadian girls around 12 years old, out for 3-4 days of hiking in Maine. They were in the process of crossing a stream when I saw them and realized that one of them fell in the attempt and got banged up a little. I talked to them for about 5 minutes and was off to the South peak and lunch. I made it down the south side of Crocker in 1 1/2 hours to the pickup point which was early so I continued to hike down the dirt road. After a mile or so, I saw Ben driving up the road and had a nice ride back to the motel. I looked for Alex and Clara, asked about dinner and found that a group of hikers were cooking in at the kitchen in the hostel. I said that I make a good Caesar and would be glad to whip that up if I could join the group. The all agreed and the dinner crew changed from 4 to 5 people. Bought the groceries across the street at the market, made the salad and had a dinner of stuffed peppers, mashed potatoes, asparagus and a Caesar salad. After dinner, I did laundry again, showered and went to bed. What a day.","Stratton

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543341,"The bandages on my shoulder seem to help hiking, but I remove them at night to let the sore air out and dry. I noticed that I'm leaving a little blood and yellow residue on my pillow case in the morning. The bandage does help with the pack strap though. Ben dropped me off at Caribou Valley Road around 8 and I walked the 1 mile dirt road back to the trail where I left off yesterday. The road was a nice warm up. My cough seems to be getting better although it's still there. From the dirt road, the trail dips down a very short rock scramble to the Carrabassett River, crosses it and then goes to a steep 1100' climb over a distance of about 3/4 of a mile up the north side of Spaulding Mountain. The trail then levels off some and rolls up and down for 3 miles to the base of a short steep climb to the summit of Spaulding. Halfway on the 3 mile stretch is a side trail to the Sugarloaf Mountain summit and gondola, which is running and will take you down to the base of the ski area for lunch. I didn't take that side trip opting for another later in the day. I was moving pretty well up and over the summit and down 800' to the Spaulding Mtn lean-to, which is where I had lunch. Carrying a light day pack makes a really big difference on the steep ups and downs, and I was having a blast cruising along, so I decided to take the side trail that climbs Mt Abraham, which is an out and back adding 3.4 miles to the 9 official AT miles, the 2 dirt road miles getting to the trail and back to my pick up point for the day,. So my total for the day would be just short of 15 miles. The blue blaze trail up Mt Abraham starts out fairly level and then climbs up through pine forest to an alpine layer of forest and then finally to a rocky skree field on the shoulder of Mt Abraham. From there you start to get a good view of the area and a look at the rocky summit. Not sure why, but I went off trail through the rocks for a short distance an noticed that an animal had cleared out two 3' by 4' areas where tree and plant growth met the skree. Looked like it might be a bedding area for something big. Scrambled back through the rocks and up to the summit and was rewarded with a spectacular 360 degree view of the surrounding mountains. My Abraham looked to be a little taller than Spaulding, and certainly was more spectacular. It was getting late for my pick so I hurried back down to the AT junction over to the summit of Lone Mtn where I called the Shaw's, owners of The Farmhouse Hostel to let them know that I might be 30-40 mins late for my pickup. The climb down Lone Mtn was a little steep and slow, but I was moving well with a light pack. Got to the dirt road and went into a hikers gallop, a fast 3 1/2 mile pace. I saw two guys walking up the trail after about 1/2 mile. It was Shawn the owner of the Farmhouse and his son Shane. They didn't get my message, drove up to the pick up point and started to walk up to the trail head. I felt bad about that and explained that I took the side trip up Mt Abraham since it was a lovely day. Shawn didn't seem to mind. The drive to the Farmhouse was a good hour long drive down a series of dirt and the paved roads. Shawn and Stacey are new owners of the hostel and a very nice family. They moved out from Colorado a few years ago leaving a construction business with the idea that the hostel would give Shawn more time with his kids. The Farmhouse itself, is just that, an old farmhouse with a big extension built on. The original farmhouse is the hiker hostel with bunk rooms and a hiker kitchen. It was really comfortable and homey. The newer addition is where the Shaw's live. Shawn has been putting a lot of repair work into the building during the off season and had a work in progress. Took a shower and realized that my shoulder was still looking nasty, so I washed it out well and applied more antibiotic cream and bandages. Cough seems to act up more at night when I lie down, but fortunately was in a room by myself so I wouldn't infect anyone else. Stacy agreed to pick up my mail drop box at the post office the following day, which would save me some time. Went into Rangely for dinner at a local pub - burger, fries and a salad washed down with a beer. Sat with a few other AT hikers - Bear Bait, a big guy around 40 who was retired army, and Sunny Daz, a jovial 50 something year old who had enough of the corporate life and left it all behind. Back to the Farmhouse and looked over the map to see what the hike would be like tomorrow and hit the sack.","Caribou Valley Road
",Perham Stream Road,"Jul 11, Mon",0
Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543360,"We were up and out on the road to the Perham Stream road between 6:30 and 7. Got to drop off point just before 8 and had a nice talk with Shawn during the drive. He told me a few stories about people who got in trouble in the Saddlebacks and also said that one of the nice things about them is that you can see where you are going next. From Penham Stream, the trail is level down for about 1/2 mile then drops steeply following a stream down to sorbet on Stream. On the way almost to the stream I got a strong smell of creosote and thought that was weird. A half mile later it was obvious, the trail crosses a railroad track and the rail company had laid out new ties that it was installing on the tracks. One thing I noticed since hiking the trail was that my sense of smell seemed to become more acute. All of the different plants had there own aroma with the pines and ferns being especially fragrant. After the tracks there is a steep rocky scramble to Oberton Stream following by a nice 1500' climb up to Poplar Ridge. On most of the mountains in Maine you are in what seems to be an endless green tunnel. The tunnel has a lot of variation but it typically doesn't give you a view of the mountain you are climbing. I've grown to recognize approximately where I am by the type of tree cover and under brush. The valleys are dominated by hardwood and disciduous trees. As you climb they transition to large pines and eventually there are only pines. As you climb and get closer to the alpine zone the pines grow shorter with an under cover of huckleberry bushes. When you reach an area where the ridge is exposed more to harsh wind and weather, the pines look gnarled and thin at times often with a base of brilliant green moss or a boggy thin marsh. I love these areas. Usually if you get a view from this zone at a rocky ledge it is territorial looking away from the peak you are driving to. This was the case climbing up Poplar Ridge to Poplar Ridge lean-to , where I met the young Canadian French gals again. They really were a fun group and had stopped for a break and some spice cake, which they offered to me. From the lean-to there is a steep up and over Saddlebacks Junior. From here you can see the entire ridge line on both sides, north and south and the extent of the climb ahead of you over the Horn and finally over Saddleback Mtn. Following that ridge was a blast and was beautiful with outstanding views for the 4 miles from Saddleback Junior. Climbing the ridge seemed to build to a crachendo at the top of Saddlebach, which was a massive mountain with a broad 1 mile long rocky top. It was spectacular. I called the Shaw's from the last ridge to let them know that I was on time for a 5 pm pick up at the trail head at Rt 4 and started down a very steep 1 mile stretch dropping 1500'. I worked my way Dow carefully to Eddy Pond where the trail starts to level out a little for another 2 miles. It was in this stretch that I started to feel light headed. I ignored it at first, but finally realized that my sense of balance was off and I needed to figure out what was going on. I was hungry and ate some jerky, peanuts, dried mango and a few dried peach halves. Hmmm.... That seemed to fix it, I must have had low blood sugar. I'll pay attention to that going forward. One thing that I have found is that my metabolism has changed. What normally would be a breakfast that woul hold me until noon now burns off by 9 or 10 o'clock. I realized that I was turning into a habit. My feet were getting bigger and I was eating 5-6 meals a day and still loosing weight. Beyond Ethel Pond the trail was level down and I was cruising. I was expecting to reach the trail head well before 5. About a half mile before the road I saw Shawn with two of his younger kids and apologized to him for being late again. He said, you aren't late, it's 4:30. We just got to the trail head early and decided to hike a little. Shawns daughter is about 8-9 years old and is enthralled with hikers. She sleeps in a tent in her room. And will only were trail runner shoes. I collapsed one of my poles and gave it to her to use and showed her how I hikers use poles to maintain balance and momentum goin up and down. The last 1/2 mile went a little slower since we were moving at the pace of the kids. Back at the car and then at the Farmhouse I looked back on a great day. I was thinking about picking up a few groceries and making crispy skinned chicken thighs with cannilini beans sautéed in a garlic, shallots and chicken stock reduction, with a side of asparagus, but Bear Bait had the stove completely occupied cooking a layered affair with a spicy meat sauce, home fries and macaroni salad heavy in mayo. I hate mayo with a passion, so it sounded disgusting to me. Ended up eating one of my freeze dried dinners while sorting out my mail drop. It seemed that I had too much food for the next stretch so I gave 2 days worth to Magoo, a friendly Nobo about 60 years old. He wears glasses and has eyes that are constantly shifting back and forth. Took a shower, washing out my shoulder again. I also had been taping a blister and sore spot on my left heal. This seems to be working since I haven't had any pain from it for the past few days and the blister was healing. To bed with an an early wake up at 5 to prep for the next day and section of trail between Rangeley Maine and Gorham NH.","Perham Stream Road

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543368,"Got up early at 5 am after an ok nights sleep. Still coughing at night some and it wakes me up. Boiled water and ate a two days helping of oatmeal and knocked down two Starbucks Via's with sugar and I was ready to go. My pack was heavy with 6 days of food weighing in at just over 41 lbs. Really, that's too heavy for a thru hiker and I'm going to have to figure out how to cut some of the weight. Strapped on my boots and noticed that they are starting to feel like an extension of my feet now, although my feet are always slightly sore now. The bottoms are starting to feel leathery. On the trail walking at 7 for an initial 13 miles of rolling up and down. Shawn told me to look for the sand beach on Long Pond about 10 miles in and targeted that spot for lunch. Past a number of Nobo's along the way, some you talk to, some you don't. I did stop to talk to Don Quoxite and Chatterbox for a while. They are a couple in there 60's from England section hiking up to Mt Katahdin. I tried to end the conversation a few times and Chatterbox would pull me back in to another topic until Don Quoxite slapped her hiking poll with his and said to his wife, let the man go. With that I said happy trails and was off. A few miles after I came across Froggy Pete sitting on the side of the trail. He is in his early 70's and I asked him if he was ok. He said yes, just St takes a lot of breaks. He hikes a section of the AT every year after completing a thru hike at the age of 63. Hmmmm.... That's how old I am. After talking to Froggy Pete for a respectful period of time I was off again and getting hungry. I past the Sabbath Day Pond lean-to and started to look for the sand beach. Found it in about another 1/2 mile and stopped for lunch around noon. The MATC built a nice wooden bench on that spot just for hikers like me needing a break. Shortly after a mom and daughter team came down from the ridge to the south and stopped too for a bite to eat and a swim in the lake. They had a very friendly dig with them who also went in for a dip. Lunch over I drank some Nuun, said happy trails and continued south first over a moderately steep but short Bates Ledge, followed by a lovely Moxie Pond, Spruce Mtn and then a climb down to Rt 17. The MATC put another bench on the south side of the highway looking over a breathtaking view of a series of lakes and waterways. Stopped there for2 mins to soak it in and was off again down the steep decent to Bemis Stream. Crossed it and started up a very steep climb of about 1500' over First Peak then Second Peak and and finally a final 1 1/2 to Bemis Mtn lean-to, home for the night. The Nuun and lunch helped me power up the climb. I met a few Nobos climbing First Peak, both friendly young guys in there 20's. One was from England and clearly was suffering from a summer cold and had an inch long bugger hanging from his nose. He pressed the other nostril blew and a huge wet bugger flew through the air and landed in his shoe on the outer side just where your sock meets your shoe. He looked at me and said, ewh, that's disgusting. I just smiled and thought yep, but better your shoe than mine. Back on the climb up the balding rocky ledge and on to the lean-to. The top of First and Second Peaks was lovely with alpine zone pines, huckleberry interspersed with Boggs, but the last 1 1/2 miles seemed really long. Saw Sunny Daz, Creature (another Sobo, cute female blond in her 20's) and Jack & Jill, a young Nobo couple. We talked for a while ate dinner and called it a night. Jack & Jill told me about a slack pack out of Gorham for 21 miles through the Wild Cats, and I decided then that I was going to do that. One thing that is characteristic about thru hikers in Maine is that there legs are filthy with mud and blood from minor cuts and abrasions. There are almost no exceptions to this, Maine is brutal on your legs. I normally wash my legs off in a stream or shower (when available) at the end of the day. Jack & Jill didn't and there legs were filthy, I found that odd. Will that be me after I hike 2000 miles?","Rt 4 and Rangeley

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543827,"Sorry for not posting in a while. I don't have access to the Internet very often and I'm really behind with updates. For example, I currently am in Glencliff NH and have just walked over the last of the White Mtns. Looking at the map, I thought, ok, some rolling up and down, two decent sand two climbs, but it's only 13 miles, how hard could it be? The Sobos were calling this section the W, and it's brutal. I was the last to leave camp but thought, it's only 13 miles, no problem. All of the others in the lean-to were hiking over Bemis Mtn, up and over Old Blue, down to South Arm Rd and into Andover for a resupply. Creature was going into town for a couple of phone interviews. My shoulder has been improving since I've been using bandages. I still have a cough, but it's improving. The day started warm hiking up and over Bemis and I was feeling a little worn out so I took a slow pace going over Bemis and Elephant Head. At 9:30, breakfast had burned off and I stopped for 2nd breakfast at a spring, pulled some water and made Nuun. There is a steep 700' climb over Old Blue followed by a steep 2200' decent to Black Brook Notch. It was a knee buster and a slow decent. At the bottom I stopped at Black Brook, had lunch of sardines, dried mango and nuts. Drank some Nuun and started up over Moody Mtn, the middle section of the W. I pulled a muscle in my left thigh going down Old Blue and was sweeting like a beast. It was now hot and humid. Moody is a steep 1000' climb followed by a short level walk along the ridge and finally a very steep 1300' down to Sawyer Notch. My knees and feet were screaming at me and I was hot. The climb up Wyman Mtn to Hall Mtn lean-to was a very steep 1500' climb over 1 1/2 miles. I was working on my second quart of Nuun at this point and noticed that a thunder storm was moving in. Please let me get to the lean-to before the rain hits. I stumbled into the shelter around 5:30 and immediately got water for dinner. Back at the shelter, the sky got really dark and then the skies let loose. It was pouring rain. Made Chili Mac for dinner, ate and called it a day at 8 pm. Today was brutal.","Bemis Mtn lean-to

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543834,"Awake with the light and out of my bag at 5:30. Cooked oatmeal and made coffee and walking at 7:00. Started with a mild 400' climb up Wyman Mtn filled by a nice 5-6 mile downhill over light bogg to Surplus Pond. It rained throughout the night, so it the trail was wet and squishy with a lot of roots and rocks, but I made good time to the pond. There was a short 200' climb after the pond followed by a steady but mild 2 1/2 mile decent to Dunn Notch. Got water at a stream at the notch and had a nice rolling 1700' climb up and over Surplus Mtn. The day started out muggy, but got nicer as the day developed. Up and over Surplus and down to Frye Notch Lean-to at 1:30 and stopped for lunch. I passed a number of Nobos along the way stopping to talk to a few. Next was a 2 mile 1300' climb. This was steep and I slipped a few times going up and over the twin peaks of Baldplate Mtn. Along the way I met Future Dad, a Nobo who tells really bad corny jokes. Good natured though. The 3/4 mile 1000' decent from Baldplate West Peak was difficult and slow, and I was glad to get to the shelter at 5:30. Sunny Daz was there along with Kremlin, a Sobo in her late 20's, a few day hikers and Hana Solo, a tall cute blond in her 20s. There was a group of French Canadian boys in there teens at the shelter and they had a fire going in the fire ring in front of the shelter. While eating Thai Curry for dinner I mentioned that today was my birthday. The French Canadian group looked up and immediately started singing happy birthday in French. There was a mother daughter combo who were cowboy camping out side the shelter, so when it started to rain at 11:30, they came racing back into the lean-to making a ruckus. It rain d pretty had for about 45 minutes and then calmed down. That's about all I remember until the next morning. Overall, a good day.","Hall Mtn Lean-to

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543872,"The day started with a nice 3/4 mile warm up hike from Baldplate followed by a moderately steep 1000' decent to Rt 26. Somewhere around the bottom of the downhill I caught up to Sunny Daz who was out of the shelter before me. We hiked together for the rest of the day. After crossing the road, we started a 3 1/2 mile 2500' climb up to the peak of Old Spec Mtn. This was hard and my legs felt tired from the previous day and I was generally worn out. By noon when I was up and over Old Spec and walked into Spec Pond Shelter for a break and something to eat. At the shelter I met Goldie Lox, Lumberjack, Top3, and Ramen King, all Sobos in there 20s. Speck Pond Shelter sits at the south end of Mahoosuc Arm and the Mahoosuc Notch, and is the place where my brother and I met two Nobo thruhikers back in my early 20s. There was a guy and a gal now in Maine ready to complete there AT thruhike. I talked to the gal for a while and she told me about the AT, the states that it passes, what life is like on the trail and what she liked most about the hike. I remember being in awe of someone doing an epic hike, and it was at that moment that the dream to hike the AT was kindled. Here is a woman who I met briefly for maybe 20 minutes, who changed the course of my life. Back to the present, Mahoosuc Arm is a very steep 1500' decent to Mahoosuc Notch over 1 1/2 miles. We had been hearing for the Nobos how brutal the arm was and took the decent slow and steady. Talking to Sunny Daz, we agreed that it wasn't any worse then previous descents we have already done and before we knew it we were at the notch. The Mahoosuc Notch is a mile long Boulder field wedged between two steep cliffs following a stream bed. The boulders are large and the path through them is a twisted and contorted scramble. We were warned to pack our polls away which we did using our hands in the scramble. The trip through the notch was a blast and took us about 1 hour to complete. Unfortunately, halfway through my Nalgene bottle stuffed in a side pocket of my pack fell out and down a 12' whole. It was gone which was a problem. My water filter attaches to a Nalgene bottle and I use it to fill my water bladder. I'll have to get a new one in Gorham coming up. Following the notch, the trail turns up and south, climbs 1200' up and over Fulling Mill Mtn to full Goose Shelter and actually wasn't that bad for a late day climb. The top of Fulling Mill was beautiful with a number of alpine bogs. We got to the shelter around 5 and met Grey Blaze and Grizzley Adams, both fifty something Nobo's. It was a nice evening and this was my first shelter that had a bear box and bear whistles in the shelter. Made dinner, ate and called it a day around 8:30. Got up at 5:20 the next morning to a wet landscape. It had started to rain in the evening and continued into the morning as light rain.","Bald Plate Lean-to

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543899,"Woke up at 4 and out of my bag at 5:30. Ate the last of my oatmeal, some nuts and knocked down two Via coffees. Which got me flying. I was hiking by 6:30 with light persistent rain and cloud hovering over the mountain tops. I felt good and strong and I think that I was getting my hiking legs. The shelter that I started from sits in a knoll along a mountain ridge, and the morning would be a roller coaster going over Goose Eye Mtn north peak, east peak and Mt Carlo with a lot of rolling up and down. The ridge is a patch work of bare rock interspersed with bogs and some alpine forest (low stunted trees and bushes). I really loved this type of terrain and had a blast for the three hours it took me to hike the 4 1/2 miles to Carlo Col Shelter where I stopped for second breakfast. Let's talk gear for a bit. Hiking out west with groomed trails with switchbacks, I normally hike with one pole which is how I started out in Maine. Hiking in Maine though is a full body experience and somewhere along the way I started using two poles and also found that I slipped and fell down less. With two poles your arms become part of the hiking machine for powering up inclines and for maintaining balance. My backpack is a 20 year old Gregory which has been a great pack, but found that it is the wrong pack for the AT. Weight is key on long hikes like this and my pack is heavy and absorbs water staying damp for a long time. There are a new generation of lightweight packs that a lot of the Nobos were using and started to show up with the Sobos. I had come to realize that the extra weight that I was carrying was hard on my knees and ankles, and started to look at replacing my backpack. I also started to determine what I really needed in my pack and what I could send home. Somethings would be replaced with a lighter version of the same. Also my shoes. I wear Scarpa hiking boots. They have been great but the inside seam of my right boot delaminated and it leaks when I step in something wet, so I've been hiking with a slightly wet right foot for the last 100 miles. Back to the trail. Met the Ramen King and his crew by the Carlo Col shelter just before a really steep rock slab scramble that is a single file affair. There was a group of three 60-70 year old folks coming thru that area and we had to wait about ten minutes for them. As soon as they were through a went on. The Ramen King clan passed me after a while but I saw them again in a short while at the Maine/New Hampshire border sign. I was through Maine and had completed my first state, a milestone. After the border it was a 2 mile climb up to Mt Success. The weather was clearing and I had cell service at the top, so I called White Mountain Lodge and reserved 3 nights planning on a 21 mile slack pack through the Wild Cats and my first zero (day off). I had 15 miles left for the day, 2 1/2 miles to Gentian Pond Shelter which would be another food stop and where I would refill my water bladder. Since I lost my Nalgene, I had to borrow someone's Nalgene bottle to fill my water bladder. I left the shelter at 2:15 and had 12 miles left, but was getting tired. After the shelter there was rolling up and down over Wocket Ledge, down into Trident Col, up and over Cascade Mtn, up and over Mt Hayes which is a beautiful rocky knoll with 2 1/2 miles left. My legs were tired, my back was sore and the dogs were barking. From the ledge I could see the road for Gorham and it looked like I still had a lot of elevation to hike down. Also the sun was going down. Back in the forest it was getting dark and I waned to avoid having to use my headlamp going down a steep grade. I raced down the trail as fast as I could. Also, I hadn't had anything to eat in a while and feeling hunger pains. I broke out of the woods sometime after 8 pm to a dirt road. Which way do I go. Looked at my map, nothing conclusive there. A white blaze right, no. A white blaze left, no. Anything on the other side of the road, no. Ok, any clues here? The angle of the trailhead sign if I was going north was angled for people coming from the left, go that way, 1/4 mile down the dirt road, I saw a blaze, a quarter mile further, a sign at a road junction pointing to turn right. Straight up the road, passing the dam on the right I saw a house with a sign out front and the lights on, the White Mountain Hostel. It was 8:30, 14 hours after starting my hike for the day and I was home. Checked into the hostel, ate a left over slice of pizza and a breakfast burrito, showered and called it a day. I'm taking a zero tomorrow, my first day off.","Full Goose Shelter

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544350,"After a really hard day yesterday, my feet are swollen and sore, my knees ache and I feel really tired. I didn't sleep well, not sure why, but I'm up at 6:30 and ready for breakfast at 7. It's fun at the hostel with so many other hikers. Weighed in when I checked in last night - lost 18 lbs in 20 days. I've lost a lot of my stomach fat and feel thinner overall. I'd like to drop maybe another 5 lbs to get to 147 or so and try to hold it there. Big breakfast of burrito, hash browns, sausage, muffin, OJ and coffee. After breakfast a flurry of activity with hikers flying around going north, south, and a few like me taking a day off. Need some resupply in town - a new Nalgene bottle and maybe some shoe goo to try to patch up my shoes. Will try to get some journal updates in. As of this writing, I am 2 weeks behind. Ok, my thoughts on Maine and my first 20 days. Maine for me was really difficult. It was the hardest sustained effort for 20 days that I can remember looking back on my 63 years. Maine is a true wilderness experience, it's rough and wild, but immensely beautiful. The lakes and ponds may have been my favorite aspect of Maine with the chorus of loons and frogs playing into the early morning, it was magical. The mountains from a distance look round and easy, but that is the total opposite of what they are, they are rugged and brutally difficult. Not as an individual climb/decent, but as a combined effort. They wear you down. The views from the mountain tops give you a view into the endless forest and wilderness that is Maine. The ridges and mountain tops are a beautiful combination of rocky ledges, alpine forest and boggs. The ridges often would have a beautiful combination of krummholz and brilliant green and yellow mosses. Walking along a ridge in the morning with the mountain in a cloud with the sun struggling to break through was another favorite of mine. The blooming bunchberry that carpeted the side of the trail with a white carpet was beautiful too and always made me smile. The forest was littered with brown toads and an occasional brown snake, ribbon snake, garter snake and northern black snake, and occasionally on a ridge I would see a grouse with an explosion of activity from the chicks as I wandered by. The occasional snowshoe hare. One thru hiker told me that he heard birds but never saw any. Birds were everywhere along the trail, although I did hear more than I saw. The wood peckers were especially interesting with a slow and deliberate tat-tat-tat in the valleys. The chatter of birds in the early morning and at the end of the day was like an orchestra warming up, uncoordinated but a joy to listen to. I loved the smell of the evergreen trees and the spicy aroma of the ferns, along with the sound of the wind blowing through there branches. In spite of the fact that there was moose droppings everywhere I was disappointed that I didn't see a moose in Maine. I expect that if I slowed down and lingered around the ponds and lakes in the early evening my chances would have been better. At the start of the hike, I knew that I needed more conditioning. I'm not sure that any thing I could have done would have prepared me for my first state. Leaving it though and crossing over into New Hampshire I feel stronger, lighter and more prepared for the rest of my hike.","White Mountain Hostel, Gorham NH

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544685,"Today I'm slacking the Wildcats, but in reverse. Will get a shuttle to Pinkham Notch and hike back to the hostel. Breakfast is at 7 am of hash browns, breakfast burrito, sausage, a muffin and coffee. The shuttle left at 7:30 and started hiking back to the hostel by 8:15. The trail starts level past Lost Pond then starts to climb steeply for 1000' levels off some for 500' and finished with another 500' is steep acent. It was windy with low cloud cover on the ridge with darker clouds blowing in, but it wasn't clear how far into the Wildcat Mtns the rain clouds would blow. For now they were brushing the south edge of the mountain chain. There is a wearied of 5 Wildcat peaks, A through E. I had climbed E and was rolling up and over the chain in reverse. At D I met a brother and sister Nobo pair from Scotland. Since I was carrying a daypack I was moving a bit quicker than them and left them behind. As I rolled up and over the remaining peaks, the day seemed to be clearing with sun breaking through the trees. It was still nice and cool. The trail had decent footing, but was sloppy with a lot of muddy patches. Somewhere along this tract I met Mickey and Minnie, a Sobo couple in there late 20s early 30's. After Wildcat A there was a steep descent of 1000' to Carter Notch Hut where I stopped for water and a pancake that the had leftover from breakfast. The setting for the hut is beautiful. Nestled between two shear cliffs and sitting beside a pair of picturesque Lilly ponds - really a nice spot. Couldn't linger too long and started the 1500' ascent up Carter Dome. I met Bright Eyes, on my way up Carter Dome, a cute retired Air Force blond with brilliant grey/blue eyes. Talked for a few more minutes and was off again. The Carter's roll down Zeta Pass, up South Carter, Middle Carter and then North Carter. Took a lunch break along the way and met 4-5 other Sobos on a rocky ledge with a beautiful view. From the smell of it they had toked up pretty well and had melted into the sunny ledge. Standing there I said ""this is a beautiful view"". A guy to my left responded by pushing out a ten second fart into the rocks which amplified and modified the tone. I said ""nice reverberation on that one"". His response was to push out anther five second blast. My response "" on that note I'll be off, happy trails"". I had 8 miles left now and it was about 4:30 at this point. Took off to climb the last climb up Mt Moriah and strarted to feel tired. I stuffed some nuts and mango down my gullet and washed it down with some Nuun. 3 other Sobos caught up to me and we hiked down the steepest section together. They took a break with 3 miles left and I kept on moving. The last 3-4 miles was fast easy trail and I went into a hiker gallop moving at a 3 1/2 mile pace and got to the hostel at 7:30. I was done with the Wildcat slack in just over 11 hours. I put my sweaty clothes in the laundry, made Thai curry for dinner along with a can of sardines, showered and was done. Sunny Daz had come into the hostel that day and I talked to him for a little while. He was taking a zero coming up the next day. In the shower I noticed that the day pack rubbed against a section of my back just above my pant line and rubbed a strip of skin raw. Before I called it a day, I started to research light weight packs thinking that my 20 year old backpack was the wrong pack for the AT. It was worn out and I found that I had to constantly readjust the straps, especially after a downhill. Not sure if I mentioned it in the previous note, but I weighed in at the hostel. I lost 18 lbs in 20 days, gained back three by eating enough for 2-3 people over the duration of my stay at the hostel. I lost most of my belly fat and do look thinner but still have a few more pounds to go.","White Mountain Hostel, Gorham NH

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545342,"Up at 5:30 after a pretty good nights rest. Packed up my gear since I was heading out today into the Presidential Mtns. Hugh breakfast again and ready for the shuttle to Pinkham Notch leaving before 8. Stopped in at the visitor center for batteries for my headlamp and the spot. Met Gumby, a Sobo outside the visitor center. He was trying to get organized with all of his stuff scattered around him on the ground. Weighed my pack on a pack scale before heading out - 41 lbs with 7 days of food and 2 quarts of water, way too heavy. Started walking before 10 am. The trail starts out level and nice with a 1000' climb over Lowes Bald and got to Osgood Camp 5 miles in around 11:15. Ate a snack, camel'd up, made Nuun, and talked to a family out for the day. The climb up to Mt Madison starts steep for 2000' with the next 1000' rolling up and over six rocky shoulders on the ledge leading to the summit. The trail up to the ridge was strenuous, but my legs felt strong and the trail was much nicer vs what I normally saw in Maine on a big climb. The transition was the same though, hardwoods at lower elevations transitioning to pines and eventually krummholz in the alpine zone. I had worked up a pretty good sweat on the way up but cooled off fast once in the krummholz, it was windy and getting cold as I got closer to the top. On the ridge I met a woman in her fifties out for a day hike and talked for a while. We both love Mt Madison. My affection goes back to the first real backpacking trip that I went on. I was 19 and my brother asked if I would like to join him and a few friends on a hike into the Great Gulf Wilderness in NH. It was sometime during August of that year and a number of things happened that changed the course of my life. I don't remember if Madison was the first or second peak that we climbed, but I remember how much I struggled to climb to the top. The summit was in a cloud as we got there and we all sat down on the rocks looking out at whatever we could see with 40' of visibility. Our route was up past the Madison Hut nestled between Mt Adams and Madison with a final 500' climb to the summit. While sitting at the top, up came and old couple donning full packs and parkas can an old couple, probably as old as I am now. They came bouncing over the rocks and I remember being so impressed that I vowed to be like them, strong hikers when I was that old. Shortly after they came over the crest of the peak, the cloud we were in blew away and what I saw was breath taking, the Presidentials with a canopy of high spotty clouds. At that instant, I fell in love with big mountains. After a while, another cloud blew in and we were back to 40' of visibility. A few other things were memorable from that trip. A big rain storm blew through while we were in the Wilderness and all of the hikers piled into Hermit Lake shelter. We were packed in like sardines. Among the hikers were two sweet young gals from NYC. One of them slept next to me and was the first to get up in the morning. I felt her get out of her bag looked up and there standing next to me was a very cute buck naked young woman - oooohhhh, I love hiking in the wilderness. Lastly, when we entered the Wilderness for our hike, Richard Nixon was the President. When we left, he had resigned. Now, back to the present. At the summit it was really windy and freezing cold. I shared the summit with a family of four, mom and dad maybe 50 or so, and their two young children, a girl maybe 8 or 9 and a boy about 5. The boy was whining about being cold, so mom went down to the hut with him. Dad and his daughter ducked out of the wind behind a big rock to enjoy the view of Presidentials. I stayed for a while to soak up the view and headed down to the hut half frozen. I got to Madison Hut around 3:30 and asked for a work for stay, and was the first of four to get the privalage for the night. The AMC cru at the huts allow a small number of thru hikers to eat and sleep at the hut in exchange for an hour or so of work. You eat what is left over after the paying guests and the cru eats and you sleep on the floor in the dining galley - it's a great deal and a lot of fun. Splash, a thirty year old Sobo was one of the other 4 and was tasked with telling the guests about the life of a thru hikers. She did a great job and I was able to pitch in and add to her dialog. The work that I did for the cru was to clean out a giant pot that they used to cook a mound of oatmeal. Since the windows in the hut were open a crack all night long, it was cold in the hut and I was glad to have my 15 degree sleeping bag. Lights out at 9:30-10 and I went off to sleep almost immediately.","NH 16 - Pinkham Notch

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545352,"Today was going to be an easy day since I had only 8 miles and no big climbs for the day outside of the final 1500' ascent to the Mt Washington summit. The cru got us up just after 5 am to prepare for the guests. At that point, work for stays wait until breakfast is over to eat and complete our morning task. Breakfast was coffee, pancakes, eggs, oatmeal and 1 piece of bacon. Thru hikers have high appetites and normally devour any food that they are offered, which we did. After breakfast I cleaned the oatmeal pot and was free to go. The AT in the Presidentials doesn't go up and over every peak (which was the case in Maine, if there was a summit to climb, we went over it) and skirted along the side of Mt Adams, Jefferson and Clay until it turns to go up and over Mt Washington. Yesterday, Washington was in a cloud, today was clear and glorious. The entire section of trail I was on was in the alpine zone above tree line with no growth but a few bushes and krummholz here and there along with some ground cover eeking out an existence here and there. With the ground cover were clusters of tiny white, yellow and green flowers no more than 1/2 inch from the ground. I had been seeing them since sometime in Maine and they always filled my heart with joy. In the breeze, they would quiver as if to say hello as I walked past. They grew everywhere in the crevices in the rocks and I made a point not to step on the as I walked. The trail meets up with the cog railway, a train that goes up and down to the summit with tourists, and turns up along the side of the rail to the Washington summit. It's confusing though because the cairns that we were following continue under the cog rail and around to the Westside Trail. At the summit I stopped first in the gift shop to buy a green pen with Mt Washington State Park etched into it, and for lunch of bean chili, potato chips and a coke followed by a Hersey almond bar. I lingered there for a while and then headed down towards the Lake of the Clouds hut. Approaching the trail junction of the Westside Trail and the AT that I was on was Mickey and Minnie. Mickey was animated and steaming, and barking at Minnie. He stormed away, up the trail I had just come down. I stopped next to Minnie and asked her if she was ok. She nodded yes, but I could see she was close to tears. They had mistakenly hiked the Westside Trail and had missed a segment of the AT. Mickey was off to complete that segment. I left her and headed down to the hut. Got there around 3:30 and asked for another work for stay. Again, I was first to ask and got it. My job this time would be to do dishes after dinner, which worked out great. Hiking over the rocks during the past days I had twisted my right ankle and it had been acting up all day. I don't trust it now since a wrong step omit will buckle my right leg. Dinner was bean burrito with no burrito, salad, fresh rolls, and a few bowls of beef barley soup. Sometime before dinner, Mickey and Minnie showed up looking more like there smiling happy selves. Waiting for dinner I sat next to a retired army Sobo with an extremely small and light pack. We talked gear and about his approach to the hike. He had no stove but very calorie dense food. He allocated food by 25 mile segments alloying some number of calories per 25-30 mile segment. He had previously hiked the PCT and use a Katabatic Helious 40 on that trip. He recommended it to me. It was also one of the packs that I had bee looking at and was made out of cuben fiber. The not popular packs from what I could see on the AT, were ULAs, Zpacks, and Osprey, with the envy of the trail the Hyperlite cuben fiber pack. I decided to buy one of the Katabatic packs which looked like the Hyperlite except that it has a breathable back panel that rests against your back and replace my 20 year old Gregory Palasades pack.

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545359,"Got up at 5:10 with the kitchen crew starting to make noise. Still somewhat dark, I started to organize and pack up my stuff sitting on a hallway bench nursing a cup of Starbucks Via with a packet of sugar. I had my coffee sitting next to me when a 12 year old came by, put his pack on the bench next to my coffee and walked away. It promptly fell over, hit my coffee which got my hat, pants, shirt and pack. He was very apologetic but the damage was done and I felt that I had to get out of there tied my shoes and left. My left shoe lace broke at the bottom putting on my gaiters but I ignored it for about a mile until my left boot started to get really sloppy. It was 6:10 or so and I stopped to fix the laces and realized that there is a cloth loop at the toe that the laces go through making a very small area for the gaiters to grab. I undid the loop on both boots, tied and fixed the left lace and was on my way again. There was a light wind and I could see dark cloud cover on Mt Washington with grey sky's in my direction. The morning hike follows a rolling down with a few mild climbs up and over Mt Monroe, Franklin, past Eisenhower, over Clinton and finally down to Mizpah Spring Hut. On the way down to Mizpah, I passed a train of hikers with day packs and I knew that breakfast was over at the hut. Stopped in Mizpah and devoured the last of there oatmeal with plenty of cinnamon and sugar. The morning walk had cheered me up and had offered outstanding views of the White Mountain National Forest. After Mizpah, I continued down the rolling descent over Mt Jackson and Webster to Webster cliffs with a steep overlook of Crawford Notch. At this point the trail takes a sharp turn to the left to run parallel to US 302 following the ridge down to the road over a 2 mile stretch. Some of it was very steep dropping 2200' in two miles. I took it slow and was careful with my right ankle, but still managed to tweak it a few times. At the road, I crossed to the other side to figure out where the trail picked up, walked back to the road, took out my phone to find the name of the campground that I had reserved for the night, got ready to hitch a ride when AT trail angel pulled up and asked if I needed a ride. She offered me an apple and grapes, which I accepted and devoured while she shuttled me the 6 miles to the campsite. I expressed my thanks for her generosity during the ride and when she dropped me off, and went in to check into the camp. My tent site was halfway into the camp, went there, set up my tent, and headed back to the main building to charge my phone, buy some chips and grape aide, shower, write in my journal and back to camp. Ate dinner at 5:30 under darkening skies. Was in my sleeping bag at 8 pm and fell asleep to the storm blowing in.

The trail starts with a moderate 2 mile 1700' climb up to an easy 5-6 mile level walk to Zealand Hut. It was a nice day and I was cruising over nice trail. Along the way, I came up to Cucumber, his son and his daughter Hummingbird. I had met them at the White Mountain hostel. A day after leaving the hostel I realized that I had two identical ExOfficio bugs away long sleeve T's. As I approached them I said, ""Cucumber is that you? - yes - did you loose a bugs away T? - yes, well my son did, but we aren't sure where we lost it - well I have it, accidentally picked it up from the laundry since I have an identical shirt, are you stopping at the Zealand Falls Hut? - yes - good, we can make the exchange there."" Cucumber is a 55 year old who just retired from A technology career at Target. Hummingbird is a very fit cute gal who just graduated from college and wanted to hike the trail before starting her career in material and clothes design. I think that Cucumber was hiking the trail with her to keep the pink blazers off her. Hummingbird and I hiked together to the Zealand Falls Hut and left dad and brother behind. The hut is located next to a spectacular cascading water fall that goes on for a good distance. At the hut I gave her the shirt and stopped in for a bowl of potato leek soup and a lemonade. I camel'd up at the hut and headed out for the final 4 1/2 miles of my day. The trail after the hut follows the falls up for a while. I saw GoldieLox, Top3, Lumberjack and Creature just before leaving and talked to them for a few minutes. The 4 miles above the hut was really sloppy trail and wore me out. About 2 1/2 miles up going over a rocky ledge interspersed with some alpine marsh, I heard a scream up ahead. About 1 minute later passed a dude with a fanny pack (ok, no problem there), carrying a large SLR (ok, heavy but it's his business) wearing a T that was just a little too tight (still no problem). As I passed him he said ""your poles on the rocks freaked me out man."" He screamed because of the noise that my poles made - that's it, he's a girly man. Any one or two things alone were fine, but wth that girly scream - girly man. Left him behind shaking my head and was ready for the day to end. Got to the trail junction for Guyot at 5 and rushed down the .6 miles to the shelter to get settled. My feet were sore and I was glad to get out of my boots. There was a troop of scouts at the shelter along with a mix of Nobos. Top3 and his crew came in after an hour or so. Ate dinner and talked to the other hikers until it was dark and time to call it a night. A few of the hikers were talking about slacking the Kingsman stretch from a motel in Lincoln with the owner Paul who shuttles thru hikers if you stay at his motel.

The descent was an ankle and knee buster and I took it slow. The ascent up Garfield was a steep 1000' climb but was rewarded with great views of Mt Lafayette and the trail up ahead. I tried to order my 40 degree bag from Garfield since I had 3 bars of 3G service. Got up to the point of entering my credit card and then nothing, no internet service, couldn't make a call, but still showed 3 bars - maddening. It was cold in Garfield and a little windy and my fingers were frozen and decided to give it up and handle it later. The next 7 mile stretch along the Franconia Ridge was spectacular. Even with the high points in a cloud it was the most beautiful ridge I had ever walked on. It was cold and windy, my fingers were white and frozen, but I loved every minute of it.

It was hard work but I was drinking plenty of Nuun to keep me going. I met two gals from Maine at the rocky top of South Kinsman and talked to them for 20 mins or so.

I told them they were some of the best berries I've had. Infused with the power of the berries I was off to climb the 300-400' up to North Kinsman where I stopped for another snack. On my way, I saw Mickey and Minnie and talked to them for 15 minutes. They said that they cowboy camped at the top of Mt Garfield two days earlier under a bright canopy of stars.

I was walking before 8 but knew I had a short mile day. The trail starts out steep following a stream with an endless cascading water fall. I took it slow with steady progress but was passed by a trail angel with his chocolate lab headed up to the summit of Moosilauke with OJ and donuts for thru hikers. I worked my way up to a moderate pace and was feeling better. The north side of Moosilauke is known for being steep and treacherous, but I thought that there was good footing going up and I was starting to feel strong as I worked through the 1 1/2 mile steep section. Climbing up to a shoulder on the side of the mountain I stopped to talk to a number of Nobos and the pressed on towards the summit. The top of Moosilauke is a high bald unlike all of the other white mountains that I climbed. It was very round at the top void of any trees. Just short of the top I saw the angle again and got a glass of OJ from him for a shot of sugar to get me over the final 10 minute push to the top. Saw GoldieLox and Top3 at the top, stopped for lunch and learned that Lumberjack's wallet was stollen while he was swimming in the pool at the motel and is now off trail. There was a large crowd at the summit and I didn't linger too long heading down the nice grade on the north side of the mountain. It started out rocky for a short distance but the converted to smooth packed loam sprinkled with moose pellets. 3/4 of a mile from the summit there was an adolescent moose standing in a bare patch just 10' feet off the trail. I stopped, looked at the moose, talked to it, at which point it looked my way. It didn't move, it just stood there and I thought that was really strange. I later learned that the moose is most likely ill with Lyme disease or brain worm (not sure what that is) which is why the moose is so docile. The hike down was rocky but pretty good trail eventually leveling off for an easy descent to the road. In the steep section I saw a handsome couple in their early 30's powering up the hill with a bull terrier. I stepped to the side of the trail to let them pass (trail eddicate - people on the up hill climb have the right of way) and asked what their dogs name was - nothing, no response, not even a look or a nod. I realized that they both were wearing earbuds and didn't hear me, but still normally the people on the ascent would give you a nod, a thank you or some recognition, but nothing. I said louder, WHAT IS THE NAME OF YOUR DOG? The gal finally looked at me, took out one bud and said WHAT - Margot, followed by a looked of distain. This was a couple that was focused on themselves and nothing but themselves. Leaving them behind, I reached an easy patch of trail winding through mature white birch and hardwoods, it was beautiful. When I reached the road I started walking on the road without looking at the map. It was the wrong road but did take me into Glencliff with and extra mile of road walking. I will have to go back in the morning and walk the patch of trail that I missed. I walked up to the front of the post office to get my mail drop and learned that the post office was only open for a few hours each day and I was lucky to get there during that window. With my mail drop box, I walked across the street to the Hiker Welcome Hostel, home for the night. There were a number of Nobos and Sobos there including Bright Eyes. As it turns out, she just moved to Seattle to the same neighborhood that I live in. With the climb up and over Mt Moosilauke, I had completed the AT section through the White Mountains.

I passed Captain Red in this manner but commented on his hat ""nice hat"" - ""thank you"". His hat was a sea captains hat made out of white birch bark with a RED painted on one side in the front in red paint. I later learned that Captain Red had a birthday a few days earlier and a few Nobo gals made the hat for him. He was wearing it with pride and distinction. Breakfast held me until 2 pm (which is 4 hours longer than normal for me on the trail, must have been the extra bacon bits. Stopped for water, Nuun, nuts, dates and apricots, which kept me coining until camp at Hexacuba. This stretch of trail didn't have many water sources so I needed enough for the 12 miles up and over Mt Cube and down to the shelter. It was a 1000' climb up Mt Cube that seemed to take a lot of effort. My Cube though is mostly made of Quartz with a beautiful rocky summit and approach with nice views. I lingered up there, took a bunch of photos, saw a snake or two, and then started down the 1 1/2 miles to Hexacuba. Got in at 4:40 to an empty shelter and started my routine of getting my pad and sleeping bag ready, getting set up to make dinner and sat back to record the day in my paper journal. One hour later Top3 and GoldieLox came in and set up their tents. A few Nobos came in after them and we exchanged information about the trail north and south. The sun was down at 8:30 which is bed time for most thruhikers. It was a good day.","Kinsnan Notch to Glencliff

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545972,"I didn't sleep well. My sleeping bag is too warm for this stretch of trail and I need to swap it out. Up at 5 am, ate two oatmeal breakfast packets that I prepared for my mail drops, Starbucks Via French Roast, and was hiking by 6:30. We learned from the Nobos that water was scarce going south but there was a good water source 22 miles south at the foot bridge which also had a good tenting site. The only two water sources in between Hexacuba Abe's the foot bridge was at Lyme-Dorchester Rd, 10 miles from Hexacuba and 12 from the footbridge. The day started with an immediate 500' climb up and over Eastman Ledges followed by a 4 mile climb up a gradual slope to the summit of Smarts Mtn. The slope of the climb was gradual and was using my calf muscles and hamstrings instead of my quads. 4 miles felt like 6 or 8. At the top of Smarts, there was no view except from the fire tower (which I climbed). There was a shelter up their which I stopped at for 2nd breakfast. Top3 and GoldieLox caught me at the top as I was starting down the other side. The initial descent takes you partly down Smarts before a climb up and over Lambert Ridge before the final descent to Lyme -Dorchester Rd and the last good water source (well there was another 3/4 of a mile past Lyme-Dorchester but not quite as good as the cold clear stream that I stopped at to camel up and eat another small meal. On the way down just after passing through the first oak and sycamore tree forest, I met White Top and Braids, a couple that is in there late 60's. They are world travelers, had sailed around the globe and had stopped in Port Townsand WA along the way. I noticed that they carried recorders, a flute like instrument and asked if they played them at camp. They said that they normally play them in less populated places, like mountain tops. I bet it would be lovely to hear them play. Down at the road, I pulled 3 1/2 quarts and ate some beef jerky, dried papaya, apricots and washed it down with Nuun. Just when I was ready to leave again, Top3 and GoldieLox came by again. I left them at the stream and started up a forested Winslow Ledge passing a few Nobos at a stream 3/4 of a mile from the stream I just stopped at. This would be the last water source for the next 12 miles. It was a warm day and I needed to meter my water usage. It was a three mile climb up and over Holt's Ledge, a nice rocky ledge which did have a few good lookouts. On the way down I passed a number of Nobos who told me that there was trail magic at Goose Pond Rd, just a mile away. I started chanting to myself ""Pick a pack of firecrackers sis-boom-ba, trail magic trail magic, ra-ra-ra"" over and over again until I got to the road and met a generous New Hampshire couple in there early fifties roasting hotdogs in a grill with cokes in a cooler. When you are walking hungry like most thru hikers, coming to something like this is like finding an oasis in a desert. I talked to them for a few minutes and then scarfed down two dogs with mustard, and washed it down with a cold coke. Just when I was ready to leave, yes, Top3 and GoldieLox showed up hungry for a few dogs themselves. I was ready for the last six miles of the day and the 1500' climb up and over the North and South Peak of Moose Mtn. For some reason this climb seemed to take forever. I think I was getting tired. From the South Peak it was 2 1/2 miles to the footbridge and the end of the day. I got there 20-30 minutes before Top3 and GoldieLox and started to set up my tent. Putting together the main tent pole, I realize that the metal sleeve that I glued into each pole segment had not been glued properly by MSR and had pushed into the pole at the middle of the pole. I wasn't able to connect the pole together to make a continuous pole. Top3 had some gorilla tape which I used to jimmy rig the pole for the night. It made for a wired looking tent, but worked for the evening. GoldieLox started a fire to chase the bugs away and we had a nice evening. In bed at 9, didn't sleep well because it was too hot and was up at 4 to pee. It was Saturday, and I suspected that I would have to wait until Monday to talk to MSR customer service.","Hexacuba Shelter

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546041,"I was up at 5:45 and boiled water for breakfast of shepards meat pie and coffee. The shepards meat pie is one of my dinner options, but I like it for breakfast instead - potatoes, ground beef and peas. I was up and out of camp at 6:45 and left to GoldieLox stirring in his tent. No privy at the stealth site so I had to dig a cathode out in the woods. Not my favorite thing to do, but part of the thru hiking package. It started to drizzle shortly after I started to walk and I stopped to put my pack cover on and change the battery in my camera. I was moving a little slow, but walking through a really nice forest and saw maybe 6-8 white tailed deer 20 minutes out of camp. 2-3 miles out of camp I noticed that a large group of trees were strung together with plastic tubing and realized that this was a maple syrup farm out in the forest. The 8 miles into Hanover was a really nice walk through the forest of rolling up and down with an overall downward trend. GoldieLox and Top3 passed by at the 4 mile halfway point, but I caught them at the Velvet Rock Shelter 2 miles later and we hiked into Hanover together. In town, the guys went off to the library where there was a list of contacts in town who would support thru hikers. I sat in the Starbucks to charge my phone, drink a grande americano, find a place to stay as well as a shuttle service. With my tent out of order, I decided to slack the 22 miles just after Hanover walking back into Hanover north from the shuttle drop off location. I found the Sunset Motel and reserved two nights as well as a shuttle service scheduling a 7 am pickup for tomorrow morning. I also made reservations at the Greenbrier Inn for the night after leaving the Sunset. That would give me a 22 mile slack back to Hanover followed by a 20 mile day to the Greenbrier just before the climb up and over Killington Peak in Vermont. Top3 and GoldieLox found me at the Starbucks after an hour or so and said that there was a freshman orientation going on at Dartmouth College in Hanover and all of the hiker support people were out of town. It was now about 11:30 and the three of us walked over to the local pizza place for a free beer and slice of pizza. I ate 3 slices and took a photo of Top3 and Goldie Lox at our table. After about 30 minutes eating lunch, I hit the head for a pee and walked out with Top3 and GoldieLox. Top3 was off to spend a few days with an uncle who lived near town. GoldieLox didn't have a place to stay and was picking up new shoes shipped into the post office the following day so I offered to let him share my room. He thanked me and took me up on my offer and we split up to get a desperate set of chores done. I stopped at the local drug store for a few things and then got a ride the 2-3 miles down to the motel. The motel owners were very nice and did my laundry while I showered and got my gear ready for the next days hike. GoldieLox came in an hour or so later and we hitched a ride into the town south of Hanover where there was an outfitter that GoldieLox wanted to go to and to eat dinner. We got there after the camping outfitter store had closed, and had dinner at a local Italian restaurant. We tried hitching back to the motel, no luck, so I called a taxi for the ride back. At this point it was pushing 9:30 and I was ready to call it a day.","Foot bridge stealth tenting site north of Hanover

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546696,"Slept well and up at 5:45 to get ready for a shuttle pickup at 7 am. GoldieLox was still sawing logs so I tried to be quiet. I hydrated my oatmeal overnight in a Talenti ice cream container, a trick I picked up from GoldieLox. Made coffee the night before too using my Nalgene bottle. This is a practice that I will use moving forward so I don't have to use my stove in the morning. Ate breakfast and got the few things together that I would need for the day, since I would be hiking north from VT 12 back to Hanover today. Picking up my pack I realized that my camera was missing again. This time the case I carry it in was still on my pack, the camera just wasn't in it. Thinking back, I realized that I left it in the pizza restaurant on the previous day. I used it to take a photo of top3 and GoldieLox, ate lunch, hit the rest room and walked out without going back to the table we were sitting at. I prayed that the restaurant found it. GoldieLox was waking up as I was ready to leave the room and I mentioned to him that I left my camera at the puzza place. It opens at 11:30, so I didn't think they would be taking calls until later in the morning. I walked out of the room worried and got my pick up shortly after 7 am. I told Steve, my shuttle driver about the camera and he looked up the phone number of Ramunto's, the pizza place, for me. My drop off point was a 35 minute drive and was walking some time before 8. There were two Nobos at the trailhead taking a break, talked to them for two seconds and started my hike north up Dana Hill for a 600' for 3/4 of a mile. The two Nobos passed me going up the hill and I caught them going down. Up Bartlet Brook and I lost the two again. About 4 miles in I was walking down through a farm pasture in light rain towards South Pomfret Rd and stopped under a tree to call Ramunto's. A gal answered the phone and I asked if they found a camera at a table near the men's room the previous day. She said, ""you lost a hammer?"", ""no I left my Fuji Xpro2 camera yesterday"", ""ok, let me check"". She put the phone down and was gone for a minute. Back, ""what kind of camera?"", ""a black Fuji Xpro2 SLR"", ""yes we have it, looks expensive, I'll put it in the safe and let the manager know that you will come by to pick it up"", ""Praise the lord, I'm hiking today and will be in this evening to pick it up, thank you"". The aprehention that I was feeling was vanished and I was ready to take on the rest of the day. 100' further down the hill I met a Sobo hiker at a cooler with water and bananas. He asked if I wanted to split a banana, ""sure"" and I picked out one that looked like it was in decent shape, pealed it, offered him the top half and ate the bottom half. The banana was over ripe and under normal circumstances I wouldn't eat it, but my hiker hungry had a grip on me and I scoffed it down. We looked at each other and both said ""juicy"". With that I took off with a greating of happy trails and a light heart. The day would be a series of 200' to 800' rolling up and downs. Somewhere between the next climb up DuPuis Hill and it started to rain hard. I got totally soaked including my shoes which started to make squishy noises as I walked. Before coming to the shelter I crossed a patch of blackberries and raspberries, and stopped to eat a few. I crossed paths with Bright Eyes again (seems always when I'm slacking north) and we talked for a few minutes. A few miles later I stopped at Thistle Hill Shelter for 2nd breakfast where I met YooHoo, an interesting guy with a well worn western style cowboy hat. There was a second Nobo with his rain gear who stopped because he was wet and freezing, and was trying to warm up. There was also 2 other in there sleeping bags who never said a word. It was just after 10:30 now with 7.8 miles into my 22 for the day with my next milestone at VT 14 and the White River crossing. This was a 5 mile stretch with rolling up and down over blackberry/raspberry fields separated by patches of pine and maple forest. The trail was a muddy mess. I was pushing to make time and fell down a few times slipping on rocks or roots or a slick hill side. On my way to the White River, I passed a beautiful stretch of lodge poll pines, but spent most of the time zombie hiking. Crisis the the bridge over the White River is Ted and Linda's house, a couple that supports hikers with some hot coffee, food, a dry porch and a portopotty. I saw GoldieLox there and the two Nobos that I saw at the start of the day. Stopped in for a rest and ended up eating a fresh cucumber, hard boiled egg, scrambled eggs with bacon and peppers, and finished it off with coffee and a donut. Linda was a really nice woman, very encouraging to the hikers. I left after my 40 minute break with just under 10 miles left in the day. I had about another 1500' of climbing over the next 3 miles followed by a steady downhill for the rest. On my way up Griggs Mtn I met BigFace, another Sobo and exchanged greetings before zooming off. It was dark in the woods and raining hard again, and I wanted the day to be over. I was hoping to make it to Hanover by 6 pm. I reached Norwich 2-3 miles from my end point and started the last leg of my day, road walking through town to the Connecticut River and the Vermont/NH boarder and then finally the last mile into Hanover in NH. I had officially finished my second state and made a beeline to Ramuntos to get my camera eat dinner and get back to the motel to shower and dry off. Dinner of pizza, beer and a caprese salad, and the off to hitch a ride to the motel. My ride was a nice young gal who told me that I was her first hitch hiker pickup. She thought that I didn't look creepy and made a split decision to pick me up. I thanked her and talked about the AT for the duration of the short ride. It was just before 8 when I got to the motel, showered, packed my gear up for the next morning, got my oatmeal and coffee ready and called it a day.","Hanover

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546749,"Up at 5:45, finished my journal entry for Aug 1st, oatmeal and coffee and packed up for an 8 an pickup and was at the trail just before 9 am. This was the same drop off point as yesterday, I would just be going in the other direction. I had booked a room at the Greenbrier Inn near Killington VT for the night, so I knew I had a comfortable place to stay at the end of the day. The hike started with a 1500' climb up to Don's Rock over 4 1/2 miles. It started through a wet and overgrown meadow wet from the previous day's rain. Somewhere in the meadow was a wooden bridge that was slanted just where Sobos would naturally step. It was wet and slick and I went down hard landing on my left hip - ouch. The stretch after Don's Rock looked somewhat level on the map, but it was a 7 mile stretch of short ups and downs and it was grueling. This days hike wasn't as pleasant as the previous day, but there were beautiful sections of lodge pole pines, pines, birches, maples, oaks and sycamore trees. That with the moss and lichen covered rocks was lovely. After 11 miles there is a 1000' descent to Notown Clearing followed by an immediate 1500' climb up Quimby Mtn. Quimby has a 2 1/2 mile forested ridge of ups and downs to add to the hard day followed by a 1200' descent to an un remarkable Thundering Falls, .1 off the trail. Into the home stretch of 2 1/2 miles I was tired and the 300' climb up to a few miles of level grade seemed difficult. I was moving slow and felt worn out. I did stop for lunch somewhere along the way, and had been munching on bags of peanuts which I started to carry in my pant packets now. If I felt my blood sugar get low I would stop and eat some nuts before I started to feel light headed. I got to VT 100 around 6:30 and hitched a ride to the Inn, which turned out to be just 1/4 mile down the road. GoldieLox was across the street waiting for me and didn't have a place to stay. I checked into the Greenbrier and asked for a room with two beds to help him out. Showered and tried to hitch a ride to an Italian restaurant just under a mile away - no luck and ended up walking there. A nice dinner of steak, a salad, pasta and a lot of bread, and washed it down with a Bud. We were about the last customers to leave the restaurant and was offered a ride back to the hotel by one of the waiters. We had been talking to the staff about the trail and some of the challenges we were facing. They were very kind and offered us a ride knowing we had to walk back. Got to bed around 11 which is too late for a thru hiker.","VT 12

Packed up and walked out to the lobby for the 7:30 breakfast included with the room rate. Had my gear and left it just outside the front entrance. Breakfast of coffee, English muffin, cuissant with butter and jelly, OJ, strudel, melon, banana and Raisin Bran (I ate every thing they offered I think). 3/4 of the way through breakfast GoldieLox showed up and quickly ate a few things. I left full to walk back to the trail head and start the 1000' climb up through Gifford Woods State park. I was pacing GoldieLox for a while, but he is 18 and a lot faster than me. About 4-5 miles in, he zoomed off as I started the climb up Mt Killingington. Passing through hill sides of tall open maples with boggy slope of a bright green ground cover no taller tan 2-3', the trail we really nice. I was having a low energy day mostly likely from not getting enough sleep, or maybe just from walking 20's on the previous day's. I noticed that my butt muscles and hamstrings were tired. The angle of the climb for Killington was different from the previous climbs and I was using different muscles, so I just took a slower pace. I stopped halfway up Killington for a quick bite and met My Other Brother, a retired air force guy in his 50's with a first name of Daryl. I smiled when he told me his name and said, you should get the humor in my name, I'm Wilson Wilson. We talked trail for a while and parted after about 15 minutes of exchanging stories. 4 miles from the top of Killington the trail is pretty level and fast and I quickened my pace to get to Cooper Lodge at the top and my lunch spot. There was a good spring there, which was good since I was out of water. A number of Nobos passed by while I was there along with a few Sobos. I was starting to catch up with a number of Sobos who had started their hike earlier in June. I had 9-10 miles left of a gradual 2500' descent followed by a 500' up and over Beacon Hill before getting to the shelter. I was welcomed there by a group 60 year old guys and a fire out front of the shelter. It was 6:30, I was hungry, made dinner and got breakfast ready, and had a fun time listening to the stories of the old guys at the shelter. It got dark at 8:45, I was tired and called it a day to a warm evening. Too hot with my 15 degree bag, I didn't sleep well.","VT 100 - Greenbrier Inn

The old guy crew was entertaining and spaced out all of my morning prep for the day. I started out with a 1 mile downhill for 500' followed by a 500' climb up to Airport Lookout (yes looks out over a local airport), 2 miles of rolling up and down and an 800' climb over Bear Mtn. I met a chatty day hiker along the way and talked for about 20 minutes. The forest was a beautiful combination of big maples and oaks. It as a nice day. Before the top of Bear Mtn, I met a Nobo who wanted to know about hiking in Maine and New Hampshire. 30 minutes later I was off again for the top ridge of Bear Mtn. From the ledge I called Plans Too Much, a local shuttle driver who I had called to from Hanover while planning out the next few days. He told me where to meet him by VT 140 and I headed down the 1100' to my pick up point. I made it down quickly and got there before the shuttle and was confused about where he told me to meet. I ended up in the wrong spot, but had asked Nobos going by if the saw a shuttle driver waiting for me. 20 minutes later, an SUV came screaming up the dirt road, stopped with the window rolled down and the driver barking at me, ""what part of meet me by the foot bridge over the stream don't you understand?"". I thought he told me to pass over the foot bridge, but he wanted me to wait before the footbridge. I got in the car, apologized and he drove me to the Wallingford post office where I picked up my mail drop, a new back pack, a 40 degree sleeping bag and dirty girl gaiters. I was hoping to put my old pack in the box that my new pack shipped in, but it didn't fit and I only succeeded to annoy Plans Too Much even more. With my stuff out of my backpack we threw everything into the plastic bag and box that my new pack came in along, through everything into the back of the SUV and we were off driving to Rutland and the Yellow Deli Hostel. It was an uncomfortable 15-20 minute drive. At the hostel, I talked to Ash, the guy who runs the hostel, got a bunk for the night, got organized packing up my stuff in my new Katabatic back pack and sorted out which gear I would send home. I included my tent in the box I was shipping home, my 15 degree sleeping bag and a number of misc other stuff. I walked over to the post office with my ship and mailed the box home. My old back pack didn't fit in the box I had so I left it at the hostel. I stopped by the local Walmart for a few bags of nuts and walked back to the yellow deli to eat dinner at 5 of a corned beef sandwich, chips and a salad. Up in the hostel I saw Bright Eyes again, talked to the other hikers for a while and called Plans Too Much to see if he could shuttle me back to the trail in the morning. This was an awkward call. He said no, but his wife could and would be by the hostel at 9 am. I put in a few journal updates, talked to other hikers and went to bed with the sun going down. The room was warm with fans blowing and an ice machine or some other machine making noise, and I didn't sleep all that well.

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546795,"Up at 5:45 and removed the bedding and put on new sheets as per the rules of the hostel. Worked on my blog for a while before breakfast at 7:30 served down at the deli next door. Breakfast of eggs, rice with diced tomatoes, and a bran English muffin with peanut butter and honey. I was hungry and had two helpings. Breakfast was fun since there were about 20-25 hikers and we were all sitting together. Nice light discussion between the hikers stuffing ourselves. Talking to Bright Eyes I learned that she lives in the same neighborhood that I do in West Seattle. I was taking my time getting ready to head out and got a call from the shuttle that was going to pick me up. They were 10-15 minutes away and I had to rush to finish packing my new backpack. The shuttle arrived at 9 or so and I was off on a 25 minute ride to the trail head. The hike started with a 3 mile climb up White Rocks Mtn and I noticed that my new pack wasn't as comfortable as my old Gregory. I fiddled with the adjustment straps to make it more comfortable, but it seemed as though it was digging into my lower back. I tried to ignore it. Along the top of White Rocks Mtn, there were two stacked cairn forests that were beautiful and were day hike destinations for locals. Met a group of 50 and 60 year old's and had a nice conversation for 15 minutes or so. The grade going up wasn't bad and it was followed by a 7 mile rolling down to Big Branch Shelter. This was an easy walk and I was lost in thought about projects that I would be working on next year. I'm planning on gutting one of our rental houses for a major remodel including a few additions to the house along with changes to the roof line. The forest I was walking through was a beautiful mix of maples, sycamore, birch and pines. It was a sunny day and a beautiful day to hike. I stopped for lunch at Big Branch shelter and talked to a troop of Girl Scouts there. Taking off my pack, I realized that in my haste at the hostel, I failed to buckle up a strap that goes up and over the top of my pack. The plastic buckle had been pressed up against the small of my back and had created a welt and open sore. Foolish of me since this would go on to plague me on an ongoing basis. Leaving the shelter I met a dad and his son out for a day hike. I was the first thru hiker they had met and took photos of themselves with me. I was honored. After the shelter there is a 3 1/2 mile climb up Baker Peak for 1300'. On my way up I met two separate guys with really large and overstuffed packs. The first was carrying 65 lbs and was training to take his 3 young daughters out for a weekend camping trip. He was carrying everything he would need for that trip. The second guy was had been picking up Psilocybin mushrooms. He said he was carrying 15 lbs of them at the moment and had been burying them near parking lots along the trail with the plan of going back to pick them up later. The far point of Baker Peak was a rocky ledge with a nice view and I took a break there, ate some nuts, finished my Nuun and now had jut 2 1/2 miles to Peru Peak shelter. There were a lot of trail gremlins on the way down and I kept stumbling along the way. My hiking boots were good and dry at this point, but I noticed that the insoles for my left boot was starting to fall apart and that shoe was getting uncomfortable at the end of each day. At Griffith Lake, .5-.75 before the shelter the walk was mostly board walk and nice. I got into the shelter at 6, pulled 3 1/2 quarts or water for dinner and breakfast and made Thai Curry for dinner, my favorite of the freeze dried dinners I carry. Peru Peak is a $5 pay shelter, and there was a fun group there including a number of thru hikers and Vermont Long Trail hikers. Lively and fun.","VT 140 and Wallingford

Darado, a long trail hiker was up stoking the fire he nurtured through the night to heat up his pot to make breakfast. We talked for a while as the rest of the shelter group got up and I was ready and out hiking at 6:45. I was walking at the edge of a cloud which got denser as I climbed the 1 mile 1000' ascent up Peru Peak. At the top there was a 2 mile roll up and down to Styles Peak. Styles had a nice rocky ledge but there was only about 30-40' of visibility. There was a 2 mile 1000' descent to Mad Tom Notch Rd followed by an immediate climb up Bromley for 800'. I didn't see any other hikers until I was half way up Bromley. At the top I stopped at the ski patrol cabin for 2nd breakfast at 10 am and looked over my map to see what was in store for the rest of the day. My backpack was much more comfortable now that I had secured the top clip, but the sore spot was still there and acted up every time I stumbled. Also, the sore that I developed on my left shoulder on day 2 of my AT hike was still there and the pack strap dug into it from time to time. Not a big deal, but it was an annoyance. On the way down the 1500' descent from Bromley to VT 11 I passed a number of day hikers followed by a string of Nobos. I talked to a retired marine going north and we traded trail news north and south. It was raining lightly on Bromley, but as I got down into the valley the clouds started to break with some sun coming through. The trail was muddy from the rain as I climbed up to Spruce Peak Shelter where I stopped for lunch at 1 pm. Had sardines, dried papaya and nuts and washed it down with Nuun. The trail was full of gremlins and muddy for the remaining 7-8 miles to Stratton Pond. Along the way I met a group of three hikers in there late 50's-60. One was named Me Too, and he told me that there were 50-60 Nobos ahead of me. They asked me when I started, ""June 28th"", and thought that I was making good time compared to the Sobos in front of me who mostly started around June 1st. I said ""well old guys can still get it done"". Me Too and his buddies lit up and said you bet. Leaving them behind, I reached the shelter at 5:30 and thought, today was a pretty good day. At the shelter a family of weekend hikers had dinners they couldn't finish and offered them to me - Phad Thai first followed by mushroom risotto. I scarfed them down and ate my dinner too.

The day started with a mile of level terrain followed by a 2 mile 1500' ascent up Stratton Mtn. Just starting the climb, I met Optimist and Purplemist, a Nobo couple in there 20's. We talked trail for 5-10 minutes until a very sleepy looking Butterfly (another Nobo) came by. Her appearance broke the conversation and I was off again on the climb up Stratton. Like the other mountains in Vermont, the trail up Stratton was well graded and pretty easy. Compared to the mountains in Maine and New Hampshire, Vermont was proving to have mountain trails that were nicely graded and well kept. I think that I may start putting in longer miles. At the top of Stratton there is a fire tower, which I climbed (nice view) before moving on the the 5 mile rolling descent and 2 mile easy 700' climb up to Story Spring Shelter, the next leg of the day. I had been feeling really empty for a while and ate lunch at the shelter. The last 7-8 miles had been a lovely walk through a mature forest of oaks, maples and sycamore trees. along the way I passed a string of a dozen Nobos in a 10 minute period, an indication that I was getting close to a shelter. At Story Spring Shelter I looked at what I had left in my lunch reserves and realized that I didn't have enough lunch supplies to get me to Dalton, my next mail drop. I was going to have to meter my daytime provisions. When I initially planned my food drops, I judged what I would need based on my normal appetite not realizing that it would change as dramatically as it had. I find that I need to eat something every few hours now. What was a normal breakfast of oatmeal would keep me going until lunchtime (11:30-12) normally. I burn through that in two hours now and find that I'm hungry and feeling empty by 8-9. I left Story Spring still hungry and realized that I would be walking hungry into Dalton. I would need to buy extra provisions in the mail drop towns moving forward. Leaving the shelter, I had 8-9 miles left with three rolling climbs up and over Glastenbury Mtn and down to Goddard Shelter. The afternoon was a nice walk through big birches, sycamores and maples with an occasional patch of oaks. I passed a few marshes along the way and did a little off trail exploring to see if I could get a few good photographs and found a patch of purple pitcher plants in bloom, a few clusters of them - beautiful. Moving on I passed Kid Gore Shelter with 4.5 miles left and was feeling really hungry. I drank the rest of my Nuun hoping that it would hold me for the remaining miles. I felt a little weak on the final climb up Glastenbury Mtn, stopped to climb the fire tower at the top and then moved on down the short distance to Goddard Shelter. Once there, I looked at my maps - 3 days to Dalton, and looked through my food supplies again. I was good on breakfast and dinner, but lunch and daytime snacks would be an issue. Avalon, a sweet Nobo at the shelter asked me what I was doing. I told her that I was short on calories for my lunch provisions. She said that she bought a bag of cashews that were unsalted and didn't like them, offered them to me. I was moved and accepted here offer. Wanted to give her a hug, but didn't want to come across as a creepy old guy at the shelter. I thanked her a few times. This was a good size bag of cashews would go a long way to solve my daytime calorie dilemma. My new backpack has expandable pockets on the hip belt which is perfect for daytime snacks and that's where I stuffed the nuts. With the sun going down (thru hikers call it hikers midnight) I called it a day and was asleep by 8:30.","Stratton Pond Shelter

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547535,"Entry written on Sept 1st from PA. The temperature cooled down over night and I had a good nights sleep. I forgot to mention that I swapped my 15 degree sleeping bag for a 40 degree bay back at the Yellow Deli Hiker Hostel in Rutland. That was a help along with the cooler night. I don't do well in hot humid weather and have been a little concerned about that coming up to NY and NJ in August. It was actually on the cold side eating breakfast and getting packed up to head out for the day. I left my long pants and shirt on until I was just ready to leave and put my cold sweaty shorts and shirt on at the last minute - burr... I was out walking by 6:30 starting with a pleasant descent for 2 miles of maybe 1000'. Along the way I met Red and Blaze a really happy Nobo couple in there 20's from Virginia. Talked to them for 10-15 minutes, and then met Feather and Sky, a second young couple. It was still cold for a good part of the morning but warmed up as we got into late morning, but still had a nice cool forest that I was walking through on my way up and over Little Pond Mtn followed by Porcupine Lookout. On one of the slight uphill climbs I met Blade (one of the many Nobo hottie's that I've passed) and Scout, her German Shepard dog. We talked for a little while too. I was curious about her name but didn't ask. We talked about trail north and south and then went our separate ways. About 9 miles into the day, I stopped to camel up at a stream just down from Maple Hill and on my way down an 1100' descent to VT 9. Crossing a foot bridge over a stream just before the VT 9 was a Nobo looking ratty and a little desperate. He told me that he have been red flagged (this means that you have been vulgar or rude or drunk at a hiker hostel and they are now shunning you), lost his credit card and was out of food. Wanted to know if I could help him out - my reply ""No, sorry I barely have enough to get me to Dalton, my next resupply"", but thought, hell no, I'm not going to help out an idiot who doesn't deserve to be a thru hiker. Leaving him behind, I crossed the road and immediately started the climb up Harmon Hill where I stopped for a lunch break. I took the time to divide the lunch food that I had left into equal portions for the days that I had remaining before my next resupply at Dalton, Massachusetts. I wanted to make sure that I didn't leave myself with nothing to eat for lunch on the day I would be going into Dalton. The nuts that I got from Avalon were a big help but didn't completely fill the void and I was still walking hungry. I did eat a Shepard's Meat Pie dinner with my usual oatmeal breakfast today and that kept me going pretty well until lunch. But not that was burned off and I still had 10 miles left to hike today. Along the way I passed a few unmarked beaver ponds (which I love) along with Sucker Pond (which is on my map). Passing Sucker Pond I saw a blue heron, who didn't like me being withing 50' or so and took off flying up the pond as I was standing there taking a few photos. With 4+ miles left in the day I had a 600-700' climb up Consultation Peak and Scrub Hill and was feeling tired and really hungry. I got to Seth Warner Shelter at 5:30 and met Sue there. Sue is a retired medical Dr in her 50's hiking the Long Trail north. Very nice and a good conversationalist. I set up my sleeping pad and bag, walked down .4 miles to the stream for water to camel up, made dinner and ended what was a good day if not a hungry one. Asleep at hiker midnight.","Goddard Shelter

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547544,"Entry written on Sept 1st from PA. Slept well again with another cold night and was up at 5:30-45, a little late for me. Had just oatmeal and coffee today for breakfast. My shorts and t-shirt were cold and clammy again this morning changing into them from my long pants and shirt, but warmed up right away with a short climb of 200' immediately after leaving the shelter. I was 3 miles from the Vermont/Mass boarder and met Feather and Sky, another nice young couple from Virginia and talked to them for awhile. This was getting to be a routine now for that past few days, meeting a lovely young couple hiking north shortly after staring my days hike. A nice way to start the day. After crossing the boarder into Massachusetts I started seeing my first rhododendron bushes and noted that the soil had changed. It had been somewhat dry as I hiked through Vermont, but it was still muddy with thick black gooey mud which left your legs filthy at the end of the day. I would always wash my legs off at the end of the day to get the dried goo off. Approaching Eph's Lookout I passed a patch of blueberry bushes on the side of the trail, a few with berries that were ripe - small, but not bad with a slightly woody flavor. From the Lookout I had a 3 mile descent for 1500', would cross Mass 2, and immediately climb 2000' up Mt Prospect for 2 miles. At the bottom of the valley, I crossed through a town. I walked over a metal foot bridge to pass over a large Hoosic River and got to Mass Rt 2. Looking to my right I realized that there was a shopping center 1/4 of a mile away with a Stop n'Shop - I was saved. I made a beeline for the grocery store, bought a jar of peanut butter, flatbread, honey, trail mix, a bottle of Gatorade and pre-cut watermelon. I parked myself out in front of the store on a bench and ate a big lunch. I was finally full, a feeling that I last when I ate the three dinners a few days back. It was a beautiful sunny day, I was feeling good and was looking at a combined 3000' climb up Mt Prospect and Mt Greylock combined. I didn't care and powered up the 2 mile 2000' climb up Mt Prospect first followed by Mt Williams. The Mt Greylock summit was just under 3 miles away with another 700' to climb and it was getting hot. I was sweating like a beast feeling pretty hot from the climb when I pass a white trash bag on the side of the trail. I looked inside and found that some lovely person had frozen Gatorade overnight and left them on the trail for thru hikers. By the time I got there, they were perfectly slushy and freezing cold. I grabbed one, poured it down my gullet, and immediately got brain freeze - I was refreshed and happy. I took off with a smile on my face with less than 3 miles to the summit of Greylock. At the top, there is a large monument (which was in the process of being restored) and a lodge. There is a road leading to the summit with a bar, restaurant, bathrooms and a nice view. Walking by I thought, ""why not"" and stopped in for a cheese burger, fries and a grapefruit San Pellegrino. There were a number of other people in the restaurant and they were curious about my hike. They peppered me with questions about thru hiking, which I was happy to answer. This went on for about 30-40 minutes. Getting ready to leave, I thanked the cook for a great cheese burger. They asked me if I would like a lemon bar that they had just baked for my journey which I graciously accepted. I was on my way with 3 1/2 miles left out of 16 1/2 and had my best food day yet on the trail. I had gone from being hungry to nicely stuffed. At the shelter, I watered up, yes, made dinner and was in bed at hikers midnight. It was a great day and the trail had provided me with a beautiful sunny day along with a full tummy. Tomorrow I would hike into Dalton Mass for my next food drop.","Seth Warner Shelter

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547554,"Entry written on Sept 1st from PA. The shelter I was in had a group of section hikers going north and a Nobo German thru hiker. The section hikers were very nice, but got up at 4 to hike to the summit of Mt Greylock to watch the sunrise. At 5-5:15 or so it started to rain hard with a storm that continued into the afternoon. Instead of getting a nice sunrise from the summit the group most likely got drenched before they reached the lodge. So, it was just the German Nobo and me at the shelter. He was very nice, extremely thin and a chain smoker. We both got up around the same time, maybe 5:40 or so. 20 minutes later, Sphagnum PI came by bundled up in her rain gear. She was a cute Nobo who had tented nearby and was looking to get out of the rain to eat breakfast and pack up her gear. She was a botanist (hence the name), so I asked her if she liked pitcher pants - she lit up and said yes and I showed her on the map where I saw the cluster of plants two days prior at Sucker Pond. Eating breakfast, I talked to the two Nobos for about 30 minutes, packed up and was on the trail by 7:30. Late, but it was still raining hard and I left the shelter wearing my rain jacket. I had only 14 miles to hike into Dalton and I decided to take my time hiking at a medium pace. I had a 2000' descent down through Cheshire followed by a 1200' climb up and over Crystal Mtn and finally a 900' descent to Dalton. With the hard rain, a number of sections of the trail had turned into a stream, but since the soil was somewhat sandy, it drained well, markedly different from Vermont. If I was still in Vermont, I would be walking through a black muddy soup of a trail. Walking along, the forest was pretty dark from the tree cover and cloud cover, but I was lost in thought and none of it seemed to affect me in anyway. I passed a few young Nobo guys on my way down into Cheshire and they let me know that they left a pile of beers on the trail just short of the first road getting into town. I thanked them, and passed on by the beer when I got that that spot moving on into town. Cheshire was a nice small town. A few of the streets had be decorated with American flags hanging from street lamp posts and it was quaint. It was still raining lightly when I was passing the town post office, and I stopped in to take off my rain jacket. It was too warm wearing it and the rain appeared to be letting up. The walk from Cheshire to Dalton is a 9 mile up and over The Cobbles followed by Crystal Mtn for about 1200' and a 1000' descent into Dalton. The grade was gradual on both sides and it was a pleasant walk through a dull forest. I did pass a nice beaver pond along the way, a lovely forest nymph named Tinker day hiking north with bare feet. She said that she hiked the trail north a few years back and liked coming back to hike sections here and there. The forest at this point was predominately beech trees and there was a spicy, earthy smell of decomposing beech leaves which covered the forest floor. Just before getting into Dalton, I passed another Sobo on the trail - Bent, a 35 year old who would later become one of my Sobo hiking friends. Walking down through the last patch of forest before getting into Dalton, I heard a crack followed by a thud, just 20' behind me. A branch had broken off and fallen on the trail just where I had walked. I turned around and said ""well, good afternoon to you too"" speaking to the tree. In Dalton there is about 1 1/2 miles of road walk. I was headed to Tom Levard's place, a local who reportedly supported thru hikers. By the time I got to Tom's house the rain had stopped and it was getting steaming with the sun starting to take command of the afternoon. I found Tom to be unfriendly, didn't feel welcome at his place and decided to find another place to stay.   There was a local motel close to the post office where I had my mail drop pickup and called them to make reservations for two nights. I was planning on a zero tomorrow. The gal running the Shamrock Inn was named Laura and was very nice and helpful. The walk over was about 1/2 mile back into town and was greeted by her noisy little dog when I got to the motel. I got there in time before the post office closed and picked up my mail drop for the next leg of my journey along with another pair of shoes that Signe sent me. This next pair were low ankle shoes and would breath better in the warm weather. There were a few other hikers at the motel too, we talked for short while before I walked over to a nearby tavern for dinner - a cheese burger with fries and a cold beer. Leaving the tavern with a little sunlight left in the day, I was tired and ready to call it a day.","Mark Noepel Shelter

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547555,"It was nice to sleep in a bed again. Feeling hungry for a traditional breakfast of eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast, I found a local diner less than a mile away, walked up and stuffed myself. Following breakfast I spent the day updating Trailjournal entries, packed up my new supplies and got ready to hike out the next morning to Upper Goose Pond Shelter.","Dalton Mass

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547556,"I got another good nights rest at the motel and was up before 5. Breakfast of oatmeal, peanut butter and honey on flatbread with coffee to wash it down. I was out walking by 6:10 with a mile long walk through Dalton to the forest and slight 500' climb up Day Mtn, a 300' slight down past Kay Wood Shelter, a mild 500' climb over Tully Mtn followed by 8-9 miles of mild rolling level out to Bald Top. Throughout this stretch of forest there was the constant drone of some kind of motorized vehicle going by somewhere within ear shot. I stopped at October Mtn Shelter for lunch 12 miles into the day. Somewhere before the shelter, I met Mama Bear and Cub, a 40 year old mom and her 10 year old daughter out for a few days of backpacking. It was clear to me that Cub was loving the time with her mom out on the trail. Up past Tully Mtn you are walking through thin corridors of land that has been stitched together by the ATC. Past that point you enter October Mtn State Forest, a much larger plot of land and a nicer forest. Before that, the forest seemed dingy and wasn't an especially fun walk. Couple that with the drone of automobiles and you have a walk in the woods without the experience of the forest. Just past lunch at Kay Wood Shelter I crossed paths with a few Nobos putting on their pack covers. Turing around I could see why. Behind be was a large dark cloud that was moving in our direction and it was moving fast. I stopped, pulled out my rain parka and draped it over my pack and put the parka hood up and over my hat. I started walking a few steps and the rain came. A few big drops at first but quickly turned into a deluge. The trail turned into a series of pools separated by thin corridors of wet dirt. I was soaked, my shoes were soaked and the hot spot on my left foot inner heel was screaming at me. I was in agony. I had tried to put tape on my foot earlier during lunch, but the tape would not stick once my foot got wet. The tape started to move around which made the rubbing worse. 4 miles past the shelter I walked past Finery Pond and saw another blue heron during a short break in the rain which added a little joy to my day. Besides that I was a walking zombie just wanting to get to the shelter.   1 1/2 miles before the shelter the sun came out for an hour or so as I crossed over the Mass Turnpike climbing up and over a hill walking through a beautiful dense growth of rhododendron lining the trail. With 1 mile left in the day I was ready stop for the day and was looking for the shelter rounding every corner until finally it was there. Upper Goose Cabin is a two story shelter with the bunk house on the second floor. There is an open porch out front on the first floor with a common room just behind the porch in the middle of the first floor and a kitchen behind that. Peggy is the caretaker for the shelter. She was sitting on the porch as I walked up. She said, go up stairs and claim a bunk while you can, come down and go for a swim in the lake to wash off - that's a requirement, not an invitation, you cook dinner out back behind the building, and you must use the bear box to store your food. The privy is a two seat arrangement with one seat used for solids and the seat next to it used for liquids (it was obvious which was which). There were about 20 1 gallon jugs of unfiltered water on the porch which we could use as our water source. I laid out my bedding on one of the lower bunks, filtered my 4 liters of water, went out back to prep for dinner since it had started to rain again hoping to wait out the rain before I went down for my swim. There was an area out back that was covered and a crowd of us were clustered under it getting dinner going. During a lull in the rain, I went down to the lake for my swim, stripped down to my underwear and waded in to the lake on a sandy shallow beach. The water was warm and lovely. It felt great and it was nice to swim around for 5-10 minutes. I dried myself off with a hiking hand towel I carry and went back up to eat the dinner that had been sitting and hydrating during my swim. Mexican Buddha was there with his guitar and was singing songs. He is a delightful guy who I first met out side of Stratton Maine. He was on the other side of the road eating ice cream waiting for a shuttle with a hiking buddy when I came out of the forest on my way to Stratton. He had 1/8 of the quart left when the shuttle came offered me what was left. I graciously accepted it and wolfed down the ice cream that was left in the container. He loves to sing and knows a lot of songs - amazing really, but sings badly out of tune. He doesn't seem to care and blasts out one song after another. Will take a 1/2 hour break and be right back at it. This went on until hiker midnight and again the next morning. It rained on and off through the night but the morning broke with patchy clouds and the prospect for a clearing day. Still, there was high humidity and nothing dried during the evening, including my feet.","Dalton Mass

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/547590,"I was up at 5:30, packed up and went downstairs for coffee and blueberry pancakes at 6:30. Ate with the other hikers and got ready to go with Mexican Buddha belting out a few more songs. It was humid and nothing dried over night. My shoes were still soaking wet. I tried to tape my left heal but the tape wasn't sticking very well. I was off and walking at 7:30 over a nice patch of trail that followed the lake initially and would transition to rolling ups and downs passing through patches of forest and farm pasture. It was warm and muggy at 7 and got worse 1-2 hours into the day with temperatures reaching 90-100 degrees. In addition, my backpack felt heavy still and was rubbing on the sore swollen spot on my lower back as well as the sore on my left shoulder. Salt from my sweat was getting into the sores and it was a constant irritation. I was miserable and my heal hurt so much I couldn't stand it. To make matters worse, my camera lens had fogged up inside the lens and I wasn't able to take any photos. I was worried that the lens was ruined. 7 miles into the day I put my camp shoe on my left foot, a light weight Merrell sneaker not designed for hiking. It was a relief for my heal though and allowed me to walk somewhat pain free, just with very little support on that foot. With my foot feeling better, my day started looking up. Passing Benedict Pond I noticed that the heat of the day cleared up my camera lens somewhat and took a few photos as another blue heron uncomfortable with my presence, stretched out it's wings, took off and flew to the other side of the Pond. A few miles later, I crossed Blue Hill Rd and found a cooler with fresh water and watermelon slices. I devoured a slice, filled up with water, wrote a short note of thanks in the cooler log and moved on. I was a sweaty mess, but heard that there was a danger of thunder showers from 4:30 on. Not wanting to get caught in the rain, I pushed myself through the day. Crossing paths with a few Nobos, I learned that there was a cooler of cold Pepsi and beer at the next road a few miles away. Reaching the cooler I drank a Pepsi, thought what the heck and drank a beer too. That cooled me off some a reduced the misery index by a few notches - what started out as a miserable day was looking up. Feeling pretty good, I picked up my pace and got to the Wilcox North Shelter at 3:30. There is the Wilcox South Slelter 1 1/2 miles south and halfway there I saw my first black bear. I was walking fast following the trail as it curved around the side of a mild hill, I heard a rustle, looked up to see a side view of a 200 lb bear 30' away. It was me before I saw it and was just starting to run back up over the hill to my right. In a few seconds there was a bear butt disappearing over the hill. I passed Wilcox south at 4 and decided to press on to the Tom Leonard Shelter, just past the Gorge, 7 miles out. I washed down a few nuts with some Nuun and was off. I passed the Gorge, a beautiful rocky area off to the left of the trail at 6 or so and got to the shelter at 6:30. What started out as a miserable day turned out to be outstanding in spite of the heat and humidity. At the shelter I talked to a Nobo there (who was tenting), pulled water from a spring down a steep ravine, made dinner and was in bed at 8:30. Shortly after that there was thunder and lightning and the sky's open up with heavy winds and rain. With that, the Nobo moved into the shelter, the temperature cooled and I slept pretty well.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549559,"Awake at 5 and up at 5:30. There were owls calling on and off through the early morning and snoozed listening to them. I love owls. It's getting light later now, like 5:45 making it a little harder to get up. My usual breakfast of oatmeal and coffee that I make the night before, privy stop and out by 6:45. The day started out humid and tape will still not stick to my foot so I'm wearing my camp shoe on my left foot to ease the pain caused by my new shoes. The first 3 miles is rolling along a ledge which is beautiful, but my camera lens is still fogged from the humidity so photos aren' t possible. Next is a 2 mile downhill to the Housitonic River followed by 5 1/2 - 6 miles across farmland dotted with patches of forest. It's hot and muggy, especially in the sun, but I'm seeing quite a few goldfinches, which are beautiful. There is something really cheery about goldfinches. I ate lunch just before a 1 mile 800' climb up to Jug End, which was a rocky but fun climb offering nice territorial views. 3 miles left of rolling uphill to the Hemlocks Shelter. The hike along the ledges was beautiful with the forest along the ledge mostly stunted oak trees with hawks soaring on the updraft along the ledge. The next shelter past Hemlocks is 8+ miles away and I didn't want to risk it with rain threatening. I would get in after 7:39 if I hiked on and didn't want to do that. Bent is at Hemlocks with Birthday Girl, a cute 30 year old red head from TN. With the high humidity, I was a sweetly mess getting into the shelter. I did have cell service and asked Signe to send my 35mm lens to the next mail drop town. This was an early day for me stopping around 3:30, but Bent and Birthday Girl are both a lot of fun. There was a 4th person at the shelter who was walking around shirtless. He was pretty thin and seemed a bit odd to me, not sure why though. I set up my bedding, filtered 3 liters of water, recorded the day in my journal, and made dinner. Spent the rest of the evening talking to Bent and Birthday Girl who seem to be hiking together. Overall, a very good day.","Tom Leonard Shelter

Birthday Girl in the bunk below him with Bent in the bunk below me. I also had an upper bunk and none of us slept very well thanks to shirtless guy. I was as up at 5:40, had my oatmeal and coffee, and talked to Yardsale, a cute Nobo for a while. Bent and Birthday Girl were out before me, and I learned later that shirtless guy creeped them out. The day started with a 700' rocky climb up Mt Everett - nice climb and fun, and was followed by a steep 800' descent to a rocky ridge. The ridge was beautiful rolling for 3 miles with rocky ledges, krummholz of pines and twisted oaks. The ridge was followed by a 1 1/2 mile descent to Sage Ravine and the Mass/Connecticut boarder. I caught up to Bent and Birthday Girl on the ridge and we hiked together to the ravine. The ravine was a beautiful string of mossy pools and cascading water falls. Birthday Girl and Bent stopped to swim in one of the pools and I kept on going to climb Bear Mtn, steep, but fun. Stopped for lunch at the top with 10 miles left on the day at 11:30. After lunch I had a 700' steep descent followed by a 2 1/2 mile level down to Lions Head with good views. A three mile easy downhill crossing US44 and a short walk through Salisbury. Back in the forest I had 3 1/2 miles of an ugly walk up to the shelter turn off. Birthday Girl and Bent caught up to me here and we walked the steep 1/2 mile down to the shelter together. The shelter felt remote and it was nice to have company for the night. Before we called it a night, Birthday Girl said that she would be getting up early and was going to hike 32 miles the next day to meet a prior thru hiker that she was lusting over.

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549889,"As of this writing I am in Daleville VA with 730 miles left to hike. To stay on my schedule to finish the week before Thanksgiving I haven't taken as many days off as planned and have not had the extra time needed to update trailjournals. Back to Connecticut. I set my phone alarm for 4:40 to get up and out early. Birthday Girl was up and out before Bent and me so that she could meet a guy in Boston in a day or two. Bent and I were on trail at 5:40 climbing the 1/2 mile out of the ravine and back to the trail. We hiked up and over Prospect Mtn (which was a fun climb) followed by a 1 mile descent and a 4 1/2 mile walk passing Salisbury and a power plant that had an outdoor shower and a garbage can where we left our trash - nice! It always feels great to get rid of your trash. After that it was up 800' into the Housatonic State Forest and 10 miles of rolling up and down but felt like it was all up hill. It wasn't difficult but wore me out. We had a short break and snack just after the power plant and stopped for lunch at Pine Swamp Shelter at 10:45 with 11.5 miles behind us. I left Bent to call his mom after the lunch stop. Shortly after lunch I passed through the Connecticut lemon squeezer, a rock formation that you had to squeeze yourself through, followed by a downhill to Carse Brook. There was a group of 5-6 Nobo's there goofing off at the brook one of which announced ""Sobo coming, hide your stuff, or he will steal your sole"". I thought, what an idiot, that doesn't even make sense. He then said that the most beautiful red head had passed by a little earlier. My reply, ""oh, that would be Birthday Girl"". Mind you there was a really cute blonde in her 20's with the Nobo group, I wonder how she felt about the comments. 4 climbs and 4 1/2 miles later I was at CT 4, the road into Cornwall Bridge and walked the .8 into town to get my mail drop which included new lightweight stuff sacks and a new light weight tent. I ordered 8 tent stakes with the tent, they sent 1 and this tent required stakes to set up. I walked across the street to a deli and ordered a corned beef sandwich to eat while I sorted out my food drop and the tent. Next to the post office there was a Fly Fishing shop, I went in there to see if they had tent stakes, they did, but they were these big plastic yellow things. Bought them and met a nice guy there who volunteered to shuttle me back to the trail which started with a 500' climb up and over Silver Hill and down to a nice flat walk along the Housatonic River for 3 miles to the shelter. I got there just after 5 and met Bent there and Birthday Girl. She took a break there and was just ready to head out to do another 9-10 miles. I still needed to sort out my tent and decided to make a stop in Kent, a town that the trail passed by tomorrow. The day was a hard day, but a good one. The temperature was hot, but nice and it was sunny all day long. It was good to get off my feet and out of my hiking boots.","Limestone Spring Shelter

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550182,"I'm skipping ahead with my journal so that it is more current. I'll go back and update the missing section later when I have time, but for now will talk about my current status in southern Virginia with 620 miles remaining. I'm staying at a hostel in Pearisburg VA, which is one of my scheduled mail drop towns. Axl Rose is the caretaker here as well as a shuttle driver. I've been hiking with Curry, a 22 year old college grad from Virginia and Pretty Boy, an 18 year old from Georgia who is trying to figure out what he is going to do with his life. Axl is a thru hiker too, but is taking some time off trail to work at the hostel. I woke up at 5:30, sleeping on the porch of the hostel, a trailer home converted to hiker hostel. In the kitchen boiled water for coffee and oatmeal getting ready for a 7 am shuttle ride south to Dismal Falls and a 25 mile slack pack hike north back to Pearisburg. Pretty Boy and Curry slept outside in a shelter on the hostel property and came inside 45 minutes before our scheduled departure. We were ready at 7 to leave but didn't get out until 7:15 waiting on Axl. It is a cold damp morning and we have a 30 minute drive to the trail head. It turned out that Axl wasn't sure how to get there and the 30 minutes turned into 45 using the Guthook app on my phone to locate the trail. Guthook is an app that uses gps to locate you in relation to the Appalachian Trail and all of the milestones along the trail - shelters, tent sites, streams, springs, lakes/ponds, Mtn tops, ledges, anything of consequence. The falls are .4 from the trailhead and .2 from the AT. They are a beautiful cascading flow of water running over an angular slate shelf. We spent a few minutes at the falls before starting our walk back to Pearisburg. We started out with Curry leading followed by me and Pretty Boy behind. He is the fastest of us normally walking a 3-3 1/2 mile pace. The first 7-8 miles is rolling flat with a slight elevation gain passing through numerous rosy groves/tunnels, streams, sparse beech, oak, maple, and hickory forest. We passed an occasional stand of pines too, but they are few and far between. We stopped for our first break 5 miles in at Dismal Creek for a snack and 10 minutes rest. The flat continued after the break for 2 1/2 miles followed by a 1500' ascent for the next 2 1/2 miles to the top of Sugar Run Mtn. From Sugar Run the terrain rolls along between 3500-4000' for 11 miles along to Angel Rock, crossing Big Horse Gap, Sugar Run Gap, Rock Cliff Overlook and finally Pearis Mtn. Pretty Boy passed us on the climb up Sugar Run Mtn and was gone for the day until we found him at the parking lot at trail end in Pearisburg. Curry and I hiked together until Sugar Run Gap where we stopped for lunch and a 20 minute break. I left 5 minutes before Curry and didn't see her until the final climb up Pearisburg Mtn. The 11 mile ridge passed through a pleasant forest with an occasional patch of Rody's, chestnut trees, but mostly oaks, maples, beech and hickory. The day was cold with fog on the ridge backing off late in the afternoon. Approaching Angel Rocks, there was a nice ledge looking south with a good territorial view. Angel Rocks was a jumble of house size sedimentary rock - interesting and fun. From there it is 2 miles down to the edge of Pearisburg with 2300' of descent and another 1 1/2 miles of rolling down to the parking lot at trail head at VA 100 where I met Pretty Boy. Curry was 5-10 minutes behind. We tried to call for a shuttle ride into town with no luck. We hitched/walked for 1/2 miles and had two cars stop at the same time, one with one seat open with Seeker driving, and the other car with two seats open. What are the chances? Seeker and Next Step are two retired marines that I first met in Maine just north of Caratunk. Before it got cold, they would hike without shirts and were really tan. They are both covered with tattoos and my own name for them was the tattoo gallery. Seeker is a great guy and I always look forward to seeing him. We got a drop off at the Chinese all you came eat buffet in town and ate 3 plates of food for dinner. Stuffed, we walked the 1/2 mile back to the shelter after dinner, watched a movie eating ice cream and called it a day at 11:30. I slept on the porch again and din't get up till 6:30. Tomorrow is a planned zero.","Dismal Falls

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550347,"Took a zero today. A storm moved in over night brought on by the hurricane off the coast and I didn't want to risk getting soaking wet with another 3 days before a resupply in Atkins. Slept pretty well on the poach, got up and walked over to the Dairy Queen for breakfast. Spent a few hours there catching up to n email, Facebook and looking at investments. On the way back towards the hostel I passed Curry and Pretty Boy headed for the DQ. Walking down towards the grocery store a woman pulled up next to me driving a minivan, rolled down her window and asked if I knew where the food bank was. Her friend was scheduled to volunteer today and was ill, so she was taking her place. She said it was on the hill behind the DQ somewhere but couldn't find it. I pulled up maps on my phone and found a church back there and gave here the directions. Before I finished she started to cry, and said that she was sorry, but someone shot her dog down in the gully near her house. It's hunting season and her dog, a terrier, normally runs away from gun fire. I touched her shoulder and told her that I was so sorry. I love dogs and would be heart broken if that happened to my dog. She sobbed more and I told her that it was best for her to be around loving people today and helping out at the church might help. I said that I don't understand how some people can be so cruel and mean. People like that aren't worth the skin that they occupy. She drove off and I headed over to the grocery store for apples and lunch meat. What makes a person so cruel? I spent the rest of the day eating, doing laundry and other chores. Curry was picked up in the afternoon to go off to a wedding, leaving the hostel with just Pretty Boy and me.","VA 100 Pearisburg

Wilson Wilson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550487,"Slept on the floor of the shelter at Angels Rest Hostel. It was taking all night but the temperature was nice and cool. I was asleep at 10:30, a few hours late normally for a full hiking day and woke up on and off from the sounds of the storm. I was up at 5:45 thinking about our 7 am departure back to Dismal Falls. Made oatmeal with fresh raspberries I bought from the grocery store and washed it down with 2 cups of joe. Walked out to the shelter to make sure that Pretty Boy was up then packed up to get ready to go. Pretty Boy wasn't ready until 7:30 and Axl, our driver was asleep on the sofa. Woke him up and we were on our way, almost. Had a o stop for gas and Axl's breakfast of jerky and cigarettes. We got to the Dismal Falls trailhead at 8:45 and the falls sounded loud. The rain from the previous 24 hours had the Falls swollen making the ford of the stream a lot harder. I did manage to get across without falling in, but since it was raining for most of the day ended up wet anyway with shoes that were saturated and squishy. I was off on the trail first, but Pretty Boy passed me within 5 miles. The trail was wet which brings out the box turtles which will park right in the middle of the trail, not sure why. Also saw a few white tailed deer, which has become a daily occurance in Virginia. Now that hunting season was here, the deer were a lot more cautious. There were gusty winds throughout the day and a lot of falling branches, more than usual. A few fell just a few feet from me on the trail. The terrain was rolling nice trail with a 1000' climb up Bushy Mtn ridge and a second at 900'. There were a lot of short ups and downs. Everything was wet, so if you brushed up against something on the trail you would get a good soaking. It was a day that I was glad to get to the shelter early, 4 pm in this case and went to work setting up my bedding, filtering 3 long tees of water and dinner. By this time the rain had stopped and the forecast called for clearing skies. I spent some time texting Signe and coordinating wit Bent on where we might cross paths again. Worked on my journal and was in bed at 7:30. Dark came at 7:15.","Dismal Falls
