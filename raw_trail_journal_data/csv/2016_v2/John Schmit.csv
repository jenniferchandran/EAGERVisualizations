We made it,but learned how much more training we should have done.Sounds like tomorrow may be a little more downhill.Ready for that.","

John Schmit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534498,"We woke up at the Wolf's Pen Hostel in Success, GA and it was raining. One of our fellow travelers, which I will refer to as Tear Drop (for lack of his real name and his tear dropped tattoo) was awake early despite drinking since 3 pm the previous day. I dont think he made it out of the room that day though. Then: More rain. And more. All day.We hiked nine miles through the fog and falling sky to Jarrard Gap, where there was no shelter. The rain could then be called torrential. Old Testament Noah would have shit a brick.According to our map there was a State Park a mile west of the trail. We thought ""picnic shelter"" and other dry thoughts (moisture-wise I mean, nothing droll humor. We were not feeling humorous). What was there, we found after a half hour hike, was a bathroom. A measly park bathroom, and we hunkered under its eaves for hours. We were also in a cell phone dead spot. Lacking any better place we made coffee in the bathroom shower. But to our good fortune, after an eternity our good Samaritans arrived. The park managers,who not only didn't mind us being there without a reservation, also directed us to a lakesixe Pavillion, where we set up tent under and stayed dry the rest of the night.John calls this ""trail magic,"" where as I think of it more as a vagrants kind of good luck. In any case, that showerroom coffee was good and the night didn't end in misery.Yours Truly,Dysentery Dan","Gooch Gap

A ""slave driver to old men"" I am called.Pish posh.Take a look around these mountains and take count of the hipsters, hippies, retirees and born again Christians, and we are the the creme of the crop (suprisingly). Do our knees feel like they're full of broken glass and swept up diner salt, Sure. But we're on track for Harper's Farry. The rest of these guys are just waiting for Pish to come through town or writing letters of protest to bring Nick at Night back. Meanwhile we'll be checking out dead John Brown in W Virginia come July. Long as we keep up this average.Yours truly,Dysentery Dan and Slow Trek","Budget Inn Hotel

To you,rain means your car gets dirty,you can't mow the lawn,maybe your hair gets frizzy.To a long distance Hiker rain means you put on raingear and keep goingProblem is since it is waterproof and you are climbing mountains,in a few minutes you are sweating so much you are just as wet as if you were not wearing it.Then the water runs down your legs into the tops of your ""waterproof"" boots. At the same time,the trail has turned into s mini river.All part of the fun,will leave the details to Ian.","

But in all we've run into the same people again and again - some going to Hot Springs and some hoping to get to Maine - so we must be doing as well or better than average.N. Carolina though, well let's just say we have our complaints. You say great weather, I say Storm Bonnie. You say Myrtle Beach I say rip tide infested drowning fest. Wright Brothers?

John Schmit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/537236,"So the tropical storm in the news has made an impression on us.What that meant was 28 hours of nonstop rain.The fun goes out of hiking when water squirts out of your boots with every step. Then there is the nonstop whining-for example ""it's cold"","" it's too steep"",""my feet are wet"",""I'm hungry"",and so on.I have got to stop saying these athings,because I am sure Ian is tired of hearing it. We have made it to Gatlinburg,TN,a chance for showers and resupply.A little more than 200 miles done , all going well.","NOC

John Schmit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538799,"Turns out rattlesnakes sound just like they do in the movies. I learned this by almost stepping on one yesterday. Luckily,a quick retreat and giving him plenty of room solved the problem. Looked to be about 12 feet long and the size of a telephone pole in diameter. In reality more like 2 feet long,but that was big enough. Right at 350 miles done so far , should be in Virginia in about 10 days,where we will be for almost all of the remainder of the hike.","Springer Mountain

John Schmit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540592,"The bear had ate my hand. He was chewing the dismembered digits as the other two beasts took hold of my bleeding stump and my opposite leg and proceeded to pull me like a prisoner on the rack. I watched in horror as the lead bear dropped the remainder of my left hand down his stinking gullet. He had one eye, and the sob was smiling at me.As I was being ripped apart I remembered what was at stake. With my one good hand I reached, and reached, and finally grabbed the spork that had been laying just out of grasp. As the one eyed rabid Maneater moved in for the kill I said my prayers and declared, ""You will not have the last FUN SIZED MILKY WAY BAR!!!!"", and then thrust the spork right into his remaining eye.Blinded, he let out a scream like Goldilocks had ate his porridge and liked in his bowl. The other bears, lost without their alpha, fled like Yogi and Boo. I rose above the bleeding bear, looked at my bleeding stump, took out the Fun Sized Milky Way candy bar, ate it, and reveled in its Carmel goodness. I had only two words:""Worth it."" ...Nah, mostly we've just been doing lots of hiking. In Atkins VA now with 500 some miles down, and staying in a really crawly hotel. Probably gonna wear bug spray to bed. Update again soon.-Dysentery Dan","Partnership Shelter

It is 1022.5 miles from Springer Mountain,Georgia , and the end of our hike. We have hiked a lot,met some cool people,and some downright strange people.We saw a lot of incredible views , climbed more mountains than I knew existed. Endured rain,heat,bugs,and a general lack of food. And it was all worth it.Turns out dreams can come true , you just have to get up and make them happen.","Springer Mountain

I'm sorry I didn't tell you all sooner but I've been consoling myself in Atlantic City for the past couple weeks. Unfortunately now the money has run out and I kinda forgot where he keeled over. I feel pretty sure tho if you all could send some money we could kill a local coyote and feel generally confident some of him is in there, and we can stick that in a hole somewhere (I also need money for the memorial services... I'm thinking of hiring a full choir). I promise not to spend this on the slots and sluts here in A City, but there's no need to attend the services. That coyote knew what he meant to you. Nah, just kidding. We're in the economic wasteland that is Southern PA and John is alive, if not well. Lot of mountains, lot of miles, lot of smelly and interesting people, raccoons got in our food, and we pooped in the woods a few times. There's more but I'll leave some for later.Sorry we didn't post sooner but I thought i'd be at the black jack table by now. But guess we're going to New Jersey on foot. Damn.","Harpers Ferry
