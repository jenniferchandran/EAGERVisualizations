Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552286,"Back in 2012 I stayed the night at the 4 Pines Hostel. Needing to get to the Post Office, I hitched there and decided to just go on from that point. Therefore I skipped 5.9 miles of the trail.So now I'm back to get it in. I drove up from Florida yesterday. It is nice to be back. There is a good crowd here. Joe seems do be doing well.","Va. 624, North Mtn Trail (4 pines hostel)

Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552288,"Now here is the backstory... in 2012, due to a complete lack of water, 100 degree temperatures, and the fact that basically, I a lousy hiker, I skipped from Palmerton, PA to Fox Gap.
Back in May of '14 I did a ""warm-up"" hike that consisted of half of New York, all of New Jersey, and most of PA. During that hike, I actually again skipped 5 miles of the Superfund Site near Palmerton for the same poor excuses above except that it wasn't even hot weather.
So really, I skipped 5 miles of the AT two times!
(Even worse, I've done this more than once. See 9/12/2016 entry later on)
Anyway, it was a really nice hike. The rock climb out of Palmerton reminded me of some of the tougher parts of New Hampshire. The best part of the day though was when I hitched back to my car, which I'd left at the Palmerton trail head. Once again, lots of men in pick-up trucks sped right by me and after an hour, a nice young woman with a 4-year old child gave me a lift into town. They were so nice. She took me past her destination and right to my car!
This completes the southern part of the 2016 Mop-up tour. I've driven my car from Tampa, Florida to Palmerton, PA to pick up 20.6 miles of trail. Good fun!","Pa. 248 Palmerton, PA

Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552289,"It has been exactly one year and one day since I reached the summit of Mount Katahdin. Yesterday I flew from Tampa, Florida to Albany, New York. I then took a bus from the airport to downtown Albany and walked to the river to tour the USS Slater. The Slater is a WWII Destroyer Escort. She is the only one in the world, and is considered to be the best restoration of a WWII ship. She has been very nearly restored to the exact same condition that she was in at the end of the war.After the tour, I walked back to the bus station and caught a bus to Lee, MA and walked to a local hotel and got a room for the night.I have chosen to start the northern section of the 2016 Mop-up tour here because it is here that I next skipped a section of the trail.What happened was I hitched into town back in 2012 to resupply. When I hitched back to the trail, the guy that picked me up took me up a different road than t he one I'd used to get into town. I skipped 0.9 miles. So today I bagged it and a few more as I went on to the October Mtn Lean-to.Unlike the southern section, this hike is going to cover more ground as I'm using Massachusetts and Vermont as a warm-up to prepare for the last stretch of the trail - The Wildcats/Carter/Moriah stretch of the Whites. More on that later.","U.S. 20 Lee, MA

I was supposed to do many more miles, but I just couldn't pass up staying at the Shamrock Village Inn again. I was walking by it to go to the convenience store and a thru-hiker yells out to me ""You're in luck, there is one room left"". That was all it took. I love town.","Kay Wood Lean-to

The last time I was here it was all fogged in.On the top were three young ladies that were spending the day hiking. We got to talking, and it turns out one of them had just moved back to New England from Tampa. She is a Lightning fan! Too funny.In town I stayed at the same church I'd stayed at in 2012. It is really a funny feeling remembering all the steps taken before and knowing what is to come. Some of the people are the same, which is nice. Like the lady who runs the hotel yesterday. I remembered her, but of course she didn't remember me.","Dalton, MA

Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552330,"What a fun day it was today. Breakfast at the Yellow Deli, and then a 10:30 bus ride to Hanover, NH. In Hanover, I walked to NH 120 and started hitch-hiking to my next destination; N.H. 25A Wentworth, NH.I stuck my thumb out and the very first car stopped for me! It was from this woman that I was given the sad news that Bill Ackerly, ""The Ice Cream Man"" has passed away. How very sad to hear. I've met Bill two times at his home along side the trail. He was the sweetest, most gentle person I've met.She took me up the road about 5 miles.From there, the very first car stopped for me too, only this was a pickup truck. The driver was the support team for a group of cyclists. He took me into Lyme Center, where I walked a few hundred yards and started hitching again from the shade of a church.A couple came from the church and offered me a ride. They took me all the way to N.H. 25A and dropped me off at the trail head. I didn't know until they turned around to go back, that they had gone miles out of their way to get me there. I then hiked the 4.8 miles I'd missed TWICE before. I skipped this in '13 by accident when I slack packed it and got off on the wrong road, and again in '15 because I wanted so badly to get into town and get a shower. I'd promised myself I'd hitch back, but didn't. I went on to the Hikers Welcome Hostel, where I again me Legion, the guy who runs the place.So now I've bagged the missing miles. Glad I did too. It was nice to see the ""Welcome to the Whites"" sign.","Rutland, VT (The Yellow Deli) 
","Hikers Welcome Hostel in Glencliff, NH","Sep 11, Sun",4.80
Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552331,"So the plan now is to get from Glencliff, NH to Gorham, NH. I don't have a real firm plan for doing this, which I usually do. I've been out here tossing my fate to the wind so many times that I pretty much just have faith it's all going to work out somehow. I figured I'd be OK today as long as I got to Lincoln, because I could always crash at Chet's Place and shuttle up to Gorham.
With this in mind, I started hitching from in the Hikers Welcome hostel. Once again I got a lift from the very first car to come along. This woman was a local and was driving up to Mt. Moosilauke for a walk. She dropped me off at the forest road.
I was stuck here a while until I got a ride from a woman who worked at the Hostel. What luck again! 
As soon as I got to the gas/bus station in Lincoln I was told that the local bus service does not go to Gorham. So now what to do? At that moment, the AMC shuttle bus pulled in. I talked to the driver and sure enough, for $19 I'm on my way to Gorham, NH. 
Along the way, the bus stopped at Crawford Notch (good memories of last year's stay) and again at the Gale River trail head where I started my 2015 final push. Great memories. So lucky to see it again.
The AMC bus dropped me off in Gorham. I call the White Mountain Hostel to see if I can get picked up this evening when they do their food run. They said they would send someone for me as soon as they could. So I walked to a convenience store to get a coke. As I'm going through the parking lot, another hiker asks me if I want a ride to the hostel! He was being picked up by the hostel shuttle. Things really do work out well most of the time.
I even got to go on the evening Wal-Mart run and get food for the Wildcats tomorrow. Sitting outside waiting for the driver to come out, I watched the moon rise above the mountains.
I love the AT.","Hikers Welcome Hostel in Glencliff, NH

Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552332,"The White Mountains Hostel offers a daily shuttle to Pinkham Notch. Now I was there and ready to once again tackle the Whites.The back-story on this one is that in 2013, when I crossed the Presidential Range, by the time I got down Madison, I was spent. I could not even walk. I stayed at the White Mountains Hostel for 3 days healing up.During those three days, a lot of hikers came into the hostel and told horror stories about the Wildcats and how steep and slippery they were. I decided that I would rather move on and tackle the rest of the the trail rather than risk injury. It had only been 6 months since my knee replacement surgery. I figured I could always come back... and now here I am.The views today were magnificent! I'm so glad I'm doing this stretch. You can see over Pinkham Notch to the entire Presidential range. The pictures can't come close to capturing the wonder of these mountains.Most all of today was an uphill climb. Starting at 2000' at Pinkham Notch up to 4500' feet at Wildcat Peak A. Followed by a 1000' drop into Carter Notch. Do take a look at the photos. I only met one hiker all day. This was Friendly Nate. A local who has hiked here all his life.When I got to the Carter Notch Hut, I was the second and final guest for the day. That was different!   Dinner was great. It was one of the last meals served for the season, and the cook went out of her way to make a great Indian meal.Before bedtime I got to watch the moon rise above the mountains.","N.H. 16, Pinkham Notch

Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552333,"The croo made a nice breakfast and I was soon on my way. Going out of Carter Notch is a 1500' climb. Pretty steep too. Looking back down on the hut was quite a view.Got the first rain of the trip today. It wasn't much and didn't last very long. It did get cold though. According to the AMC, freezing weather is expected for tonight.Yesterday I hiked the Wildcats (A - D). Today is the Carter Range, which consists of:    Carter Notch at 3350'    Carter Dome at 4832'    Zeta Pass at 3890'    South Carter Mtn at 4458'    Middle Carter Mtn at 4610'    North Carter Mtn at         4539'    and then down to the Imp Shelter/Campsite at 3250'I started out at 8:00 AM and got into the shelter at 4:00 PM. Here I met Craig Jackson. I nice young man who recently finished a stint in the US Navy. I got a laugh when I asked if he had a trail name and he said he had not but was thrilled just be be called Craig instead of Jackson.","Carter Notch Hut

Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552334,"An easier hike today. The only hill was Mt. Moriah, a mere 800' elevation gain. After that it was all downhill. The Rattle River stretch is beautiful and the last two miles out to US 2 is some of the nicest trail ever. What a great way to finish the out the year. When I touched the stop sign with the double white blazes at North Road, I knew I'd finally finished the entire trail.When I did my summit of Katahdin last year it was a fabulous event in my life, but I knew there were still parts of the trail I'd not seen. Even though I've done much of the trail more than once, I just wanted to see every little bit.It is with great contentment that I head home. I'm sure I'll be back again.Thanks for following along,","Imp Shelter/Campsite
