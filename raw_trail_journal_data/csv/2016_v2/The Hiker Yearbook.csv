The Hiker Yearbook,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527895,"Hello my name is Odie I am a class of 2013 hiker and the driver of a yellow school bus named ""Chug-a-Lug"". After months of preparing well converting this old church bus into a mobile hiker living room I am finally on trail.Waking up the first day in this converted School Bus at Gooch Gap parked on trail waiting for hikers was a time of sheer excitement! Most of the hikers had stayed up at gooch shelter which was a mile and a half of Trail, so around 745 hiker started walking in. I can only imagine what was going through their minds when they saw a bright yellow school bus and a bearded man offering them free crackers and freshwater. At this point, most of the hikers are 3 to 5 days into their hike and most of them don't even know what trail magic magic is. It was really cool seeing the first hikers of the year actually on trail I enjoyed getting to know a few of them. At this point most of them don't even have Trail names.I spent the second day at Woody Gap giving hikers a ride back and forth to Suches GA. Most of the hikers were still talking about which brands of gear they had why they were hiking the trail and what they thought so far. We pulled into Wolf Pen Gap Country Store and the hikers died with excitement because they knew behind those doors was beer and pizza, hot pizza made by somebody else. Pizza oh my God they have pizza!After only a couple days at Woody Gap I decided to move forward to Neel Gap. The Outfitter there only hires former thru hikers and this is the first place for the hikers to get professional advice. Most of them drop several pounds in their backpack at this point. Hikers were pouring in one after the other, anywhere from 15 to 20 hikers a day saying they were attempting to hike the entire Trail. All of those hikers were more than happy to sit on a soft couch in a yellow school bus.While on a shuttle down to booger Hollow, ""Chug-a-Lug"" blew an exhaust manifold plug. It kind of sounded like driving a shotgun that was firing off every 2 - 3 seconds. The smell of exhaust filled the interior of the cabin quickly. Luckily I have 9 windows, so I put every window down and limped back up to Neel Gap. Being this was Saturday afternoon I had to wait at the Gap until Monday for a place to open in order to get a new plug. So here I sit in McDonald's soaking up free Wi-Fi waiting on the Old Yeller School Bus to get fixed up again. The plan is to make it to Harpers Ferry for the flip flop Festival by Thursday at 11 miles per gallon and a top speed of 50 miles per hour let the journey begin!","Gooch Gap

The Hiker Yearbook,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528027,"I had a great time in Damascus even though I pulled an nero. I drove into town in the early evening contacted a few locals and was able to give a yearbook to a person who's striving to complete this Trail. One of my favorite things to do is give these books away. I know I have to sell them to make money but I've never cared much about money.I pulled the bus in front of Crazy Larry's Hostel, opened the doors, and threw an open house party with fresh water, cookies, and crackers for all the hikers walking by. While the radio played in the background, this season's hikers had some really cool stories to tell. Around 3:30 that afternoon I decided I needed to get moving loaded up the bus and yellow blazed out of town.I fully intended on pulling into Waynesboro, Virginia for the night but instead I slept at a dirt road along Interstate 81. Waking up to the realization that I now live in this bus full time was both blissful and a little concerning. I've really started priding myself and making sure this bus is always ready to host hikers and make them feel comfortable. I started giving rides to hikers to and from the grocery store so they can resupply. I never asked for any money, but of the two rides I gave yesterday the hikers gave me nearly $9. This bus can't run on love alone but it simply won't run without it.I pulled out of my stealth testing site and set my navigation towards Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. It was before noon that I pulled in to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, so excited to get the buses picture in front of that famous sign! I went inside and got a warm welcome from ATC members and volunteers. I was surprised to find that already 23 hikers had registered a thru-hike coming out of Georgia two of them were at the Conservancy I was able to talk to them for a while before they grabbed their packs and headed up Trail.Last night I drove to Hi Harpers Ferry Hostel intending to park in the parking lot there but then found that they don't even open until May 1st. So I left the parking lot in search of a place to park a bus. This seems to be the fun game I get to play, where to hide a school bus every night. I ended up deciding on a church parking lot knowing this would be a safe place to stay. At around 2 A.M. I gotta knock on the door by a State Trooper. He said that some members of the church were driving by saw the bus and knew it didn't belong to the church and wanted him to check it out. I turned the lights on and invited the officer inside, he said there was no need for that, I've done a great job with renovating the bus and I'm obviously not a bad individual so I could go ahead and sleep for the rest of the night. He said I chose well going to a church parking lot. He knew about the flip flop festival and asked if that's why I was in town I smiled ear-to-ear and said why yes it is I am flipping excited about the Harpers Ferry Flip Flop Festival.So here I sit, on a Friday at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy filled with excitement to meet this year's class of flip floppers. I even get to do a talk on in town hiker etiquette alongside Heather Brave who will be talking about hiker help and Trail Magic. At 11 miles per gallon and a max speed of 50 miles per hour old ""Chug-a-Lug"" is hanging in there and enjoying every mile of Trail even though she has to take it by roadside.","Damascus

The Hiker Yearbook,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528752,"I'm in my bus sitting in the parking lot of some hotel. I gave two hikers a ride from the trail to the hotel and told them I would just sleep in the parking lot so they would have a ride back in the morning. Works fine for me because I am just worn out after the annual Flip Flop Festival in Harpers Ferry this past weekend. The Flip Flop Festival this weekend was great! One thru hiker named Sporky even decided to pull a couple zeros to help the ATC setup and to help with parking the following day. It was just as much fun setting up for the festival as the festival was itself, the comradery out here on the trail is something that's second to none.The ATC highly organized this event with several talks, raffles and vendors. I was able to set up the school bus to show people my tiny home and tell them how I'm driving up and down the Appalachian Trail photographing thru-hikers and long distance section hikers to produce The Hiker Yearbook. I even sold 4 books!Sunday morning they had a breakfast that was cooked by the local Boy Scouts and then the official send-off for the 2016 flip floppers. I tell you it was quite an event. The plan now is to drive south. I have to make it back to Hot Springs soon. Then comes the Big Festival, the Great Festival, the Mega Festival, the TRAIL DAYS FESTIVAL!So at 11 miles per gallon and a max speed of 50 miles per hour, Hikers Hike!","

The Hiker Yearbook,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/530360,"There I was in Hot Springs, North Carolina loading up the bus and getting ready to pull out. I had spent the last two hours hanging out at the Hiker Ridge Ministries. They had a lot of hikers there and Queen Diva was busy making cookies and coffee. Just as I was putting the bus and drive a hiker came around the corner and said to me ""What are we supposed to do the trail is on fire?""So I walked out into the middle of the street and could see the mountains just north of Hot Springs were ablaze! I went down to the laundromat and picked up Miss Janet and she and I drove to the top of the mountain to sit and wait for hikers that would surely be flushed out from all the smoke. We ran into a ranger at the top and explained to them that there were definitely hikers on trail and that trail was currently on fire, they had a plan and sent a ranger in to flush all the hikers out. About 30 hikers emerged from the woods southbound into Hot Springs, each one of them wide-eyed and staring at those three mountains that were just simply on fire.It wasn't long before we heard the Choppers coming in. They had their big water reservoirs and were dipping them into the river and spraying down the fire as if they've been trained to do so a thousand times over. It sure was impressive to watch but I'll tell you this, the fire was winning and by a lot. It wasn't too much longer before the helicopter landed and about 10 men between the ages of 18 and 23 got out on the ground and started putting on their fire gear. I was able to snap a quick photo of them with the fire in the background just before they jumped back on the helicopter to get dropped off right there in that fire.I then was standing on the streets of Hot Springs, on the Appalachian Trail itself and I was just watching the trail burn. It's one thing to see this on TV but actually hear the roar, smell the smoke, and watch the horror play out right there before your very eyes, I teared up a little. It was a tough thing to watch. It was a heartbreaking thing to watch.The fire had only been burning for about 6 hours and at that point it was completely out of control. They sent in the big dogs. A huge plane flew right over town and we knew that was the plane that was going to drop that red dust that seems to put fire out. After one fly by he squared himself off and drop that fire retardant in a perfect line behind this cabin that they were trying to protect. They were successful I'd say, that cabin is still standing on that Hillside today but that mountain sure is burnt up behind it.I went to the police chief and said, ""All the hostel are filling up hotels too, you got about 50 or 60 extra hikers in town, do you mind if I run around and try to find some places for them to stay?"" He was appreciative of the help. I went down to talk to Dollar General and the restaurant and was able to get free tenting for the hikers in the field behind there. Hiker Ridge Ministries also gave a stretch of land for hikers to put their tents on. Hot Springs Spa immediately dropped their prices from $20 all the way down to $6 for their tent sites which came with a free shower.I was extremely impressed the way the trail community came together and how the community of Hot Springs seemed to be very well prepared. Not a single hiker was burned or injured in any way thanks to these professionals in uniform.After that I drove down to Fontana Dam and was able to hike 6 miles into the Smokies. Ran into some friends doing Troll Magic and then I left up to Erwin where I had the bus fixed. Turned out to be only $58! It wasn't switching out of first gear so I thought it was going to be the transmission. Thank God for the little things, the $58 things.At 11 miles per gallon and 50 miles per hour Hikers Hike!","Hot Springs

The Hiker Yearbook,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/531734,"Well old Chug-a-lug has gone all the way from Harpers Ferry, back down to Georgia, up to Damascus, back down to Fontana Dam, and back to where I sit once again in Hot Springs North Carolina. I do have to say, Hot Springs has always been one of my favorite trail towns.Think I've spent most of my time in Erwin, Tennessee at Uncle Johnny's over this last week. He had a good old southern shrimp boil! There must have been close to a hundred hikers there and believe it or not there was at least one or two bowls of leftover shrimp. Hikers started pouring off the trail 2 to 3 days before the party in anticipation for what was to come. I pitched in and began running the shuttles for Uncle Johnny. I must have had over one hundred hikers inside this bus in less than three days, traveling back and forth between the Walmart and the grocery store and the local diners.Once I had a few hikers in the bus I would tell him about The Hiker Yearbook and they would get excited. Then I would begin to tell him about how much free stuff I had to give away at Trail Days and their eyes would light up with the idea of upgrading their gear for free!Uncle Johnny's party was as always pretty Epic he had a talent show free gear giveaway and even a live band. Mr. Fix It came down and offered to fix anyone who had torn and worn out gear for free he worked for about 10 hours fix an over 20 hikers stuff. He was so in this and replacing buckles on Old worn-out gear that had seen over 300 miles of Trail.I decided I'd run through a couple Trail towns and show off the yearbook and get people excited about Trail Days, so I left early and drove down to Standing Bear Hostel and Farm. Maria was warm and inviting gave The Hiker Yearbook a place to park the school bus for the night and showers. I may be traveling this Trail in a bus but I know the value of a good shower. From there I went back to Hot Springs. Seems like there's a bubble of hikers here. Hikers this far back on trail are all deciding if they're going to hitchhike forward to get to Trail Days or if they're just going to hike on. That seems to be the question on everybody's mind, am I going to Trail Days?I've spent most of my down time trying to talk to Outfitters and stores along the trail to get donated gear to give away at Trail Days. One of my favorite things to do is give stuff away. Won't be long now and I'll take this bus up to Damascus where it will be parked and waiting for that Holy party, that insane party, that once-in-a-lifetime experience where the town of Damascus turns into the event Trail Days!","Erwin
