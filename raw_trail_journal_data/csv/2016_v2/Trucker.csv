Trucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/154968,"A month ago my family and I had a chance encounter with a man at the base of Clingmans dome lookout in the GSMNP. He told us he had been hiking for 3 months and was on his way to Georgia. I knew of the Appalachian Trail but didn't know the extent of how long it stretched. Anyway, Bailee and Cody were complaining about walking up the steep grade on the paved trail to the top of the dome. They were slowing down and Carla was trying to convince them to keep moving. We were spending our first camping trip here in the Smokies. It rained the night before and almost all that day. We got to the top of Clingmans Dome and couldn't see a damn thing. I was frustrated that the day had become such a bomb for fun for the kids. This was the first real vacation we had ever taken with the kids. Syndey was the only true happy one on the trip. She got to ride daddy's shoulders to the top of the mountain.The following few weeks I spent thinking about that man at the base of the lookout. He was around 65 years young. I started thinking that I might be able to complete something of this nature some day. Being tied to my job and supporting my family I can't just take off and decide to do something like this.Alot of this thinking was aided by the very recent memory of me having surgery to repair my esophagus. I had a true brush with death and one that was very vivid in my mind. I have always thought that life would be safe and easy. I have position in the military that I have enjoyed for 11 years now. What am I doing thinking of the future at a point in my life when I was lucky to have survived the very recent past.I had promised Carla that I wouldn't retire until Cody graduated from high school. That would be my time to relax and have a second go at life. Yesterday I told her the thoughts that have been on my mind for the past few weeks. I told her that within a year of my retirement, I will hike the AT. I didn't ask her if I could do this. I didn't want her to think that it was a decision that I needed help in making. My mind was already made up.Cody is 7 and in the 2nd grade this year. I guess I have some planning and practicing to do for the next 10+ years. But I will be checking in now and then to tell everyone of my plans and my pre-dream experiences.",,The Beginning of my dreams,"Aug 30, Wed",0
Trucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/155877,"Well it's been a week or so since my last entry. I've read and re-read a few of the 2003 journals on here and it's done nothing but entice me even more to take off on my trip. Excitement is not entirely and understatement. I've done research into the trail, the towns along the trail and alot of the hiking ins and outs. In the last few days I have asked myself why am I so hung up on this idea? Why do I want to do this so much? Is it worth it? In a way I don't know that I'll ever be able to answer any of these questions. I know one thing though. That if I don't tell a soul about my dream adventure I will have no reason to complete it. I want to do this so much that I have made this journal to be my reason to take this chance.More about me. I am Jason Robinson. Father of three very bright and beautiful kids. Bailee, Daniel (Cody), and Sydney. My wife Carla and I met in 1997 at Barksdale AFB. We worked together at the Vehicle Operations Flight in the 2nd Transportation Squadron. We married in 1998 and moved in 2001 to North Carolina. Carla has since gotten out of the active duty service and is now a reservist. I am still a vehicle operator for the Air Force. I have been in the service since 1995 and plan to retire in 11 years or so. (I say 11 years or so because of an agreement I made with my family. Retire only after Cody graduates high school.)Since my hike of the AT is not to happen for quite a few more years I will be able to sit back and read the journals of those who go before me. This only makes me more excited to take my trip. For now I am going to sit back and read a few of those journals. I'll write more later.","The Beginning of my dreams

Trucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/212463,"Well folks. I've spent the past 226 days away from my family. I haven't been on a hike. But I have been making some miles. I'm about to be homeward bound from Kuwait. I've been driving convoys in Iraq. It has been a long time since I saw my family. I left home on April 14, 2007 to come over here and do this. Now that it is over, all I want is to see my kids and my wife. When I left home my little one, Sydney, wasn't talking. She would say a word here and there but not really talking. Now Carla says she won't shut up. And I can hear her when I am on the phone with Carla. It's like a non-stop chatter box. Carla says she will drive me nuts when I get home. I so don't think so. I would give anything to be able to here that little girl right now.For those of you who have never spent time away from family like this before, I have one tip for you. I made my first deployment to Southwest Asia in 1997. I made the mistake back then of counting the days away from home and the days until I got home. Doing that made me miss my loved ones so much. Yes it will still feel long even if you don't count. 226 days and counting is a long time. But it makes you focus less on what you are missing out on, and helps you realize your true goal of making it to the next day and the next and the next. Stay on target and make your miles.","Kuwait

Trucker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/239119,"I've been back into getting myself in shape for a change. I'm in the middle of quitting smoking right now. If that's not hard enough, I am fighting keeping off extra weight for the first time in my life. I've never tipped 200 lbs before now. So after months of doing my daily 2 mile run, occasionally opting for 3 miles, I gave a shot a double digits. My shop got the idea to do a 12 mile fun run. I didn't run all the way. (There wasn't no way in hell I'd do that.) But I did complete the whole 12 miles. 2 hours and 43 minutes for 12 miles wasnt' too bad. But consider this has nothing on AT conditioning. I wasn't carrying a pack. It was all FLAT. When I walked I walked a super fast pace and ended up pulling a muscle in the back of my left knee. All in all though I felt great after that ""run"". We'll see just how far I can make it next time I try doing this.
Good luck to the Class of 2008 out there on the trail right now. I'm watching you all and hope you all make it as far a you have planned too.","Seymour Johnson AFB Perimeter Road
