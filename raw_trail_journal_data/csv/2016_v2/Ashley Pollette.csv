Ashley Pollette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479486,"My name is Ashley and I plan to start my hike May 1, 2016, from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, to Katahdin. I will then return to Harpers Ferry and head toward Springer and home. I like people and a March start at Springer was my plan until recently. Work and family responsibility has interfered and the truth is, I am not a wealthy person and I have had to work hard to achieve my present status. The good news is I will have the funds and a loving wife who will support my hike.",,WHY HEAD-START: MAY,"Dec 28, Sun",0
Ashley Pollette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479487,"I have followed several journals on this forum. Many of them are very well done and my top three are Left Turn, Forest, and Trail Pilgrim. I am nowhere close to having the writing skills of these three people, but I do think I will have something to offer for those who follow me. Which will mostly be family and friends. Trail Pilgrim has been giving expert advice, while Left Turn and Forest wrote about their experiences on the trail. Both of these writers were able to hold my attention to every stream, rock and mountain they trekked. They were also able to give you insight to their psychic. People you have never met are able to explain the trail and the people they met in a fashion that you could not wait for the next installment.",,Journals I Followed ,"Dec 28, Sun",0
Ashley Pollette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479489,"Garden of Eden Trail & two trails at Torreya State Park with their high bluffs overlooking the Apalachicola River make Torreya and Garden of Eden one of Florida's most scenic areas. Torreya is named for an extremely rare species of Torreya tree that only grows on the bluffs along the Apalachicola River. Torreya State Park and the Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve where the Garden of Eden trail is located give you a feel of what hiking the AT will be. The trails are short, but offer many ups and downs with the bluffs and ravines (gulley to us country folks) providing the only place I know in Florida which comes close to conditions on the AT. I have had several folks make fun of me on Whiteblaze.net when I have posted information about testing gear and doing practice hikes at Torreya. I recently tested hammock camping in 40 degree weather at Torreya and found it very enjoyable. I have hiked the trail several times, but never camped. I will be back through the winter and spring months. No one can stand the summer months.",,Garden of Eden & Torreya State Park,"Dec 28, Sun",0
Ashley Pollette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479490,"Last year (2013) a friend, his 14 year old son, and my two 14 year old grandsons hiked from Amicalola Falls State Park to Neel Gap. We were rain soaked from the start. Not until the third day when we reached Preacher’s Rock on Big Cedar Mountain did the skies clear. We had the most beautiful view from Preacher’s Rock and we camped in the area. We prepared our dinner meal and sat on the rock and watched pieces of cloud move through the trees and rise from the mountains. This reminded all of us of the Smokey Mountains. The rains returned that night in a grand electrical storm and stayed with us until we reached the base of Blood Mountain. Up and over the mountain with the mist and clouds giving the stone house at the top an eerie look and feel. We finally arrived at Neel Gap for a wonderful hot shower at Mountain Crossings. Three young men were introduced to the trail and even though they walked the distance in cold July rain, they now have a dream of a through hike of the AT. I think the one beautiful view of the Georgia Mountains from Preacher’s Rock was enough to plant a seed. This trip was a test for myself and I passed. I knew from the time I came off of Blood Mountain I still had time and strength to make the hike.",,A Few Seeds & a Test,"Dec 28, Sun",0
Ashley Pollette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479499,"Before I initiate my hike I have so many concerns to work out about equipment. The Big 3 of backpacking includes pack, shelter, and sleeping system. If you add a cooking system then you actually have the Big 4 to be concern about. Lots of folks are concerned about weight, but I have found that if you need something and it works for you, then maybe the trade for a few ounces is worth it. 
Let’s look at cooking systems. I presently own a Jetboil Flash, Solo wood burner and an Alcohol stove. I have used the Flash and the Solo stove on several overnight or multiday trips and found they both work well for Freezer Bag Cooking (FBC) or for Mountain House type meals. I have prepared several meals at home testing the alcohol stove and found it certainly meets most of my needs for heating water. The alcohol stove certainly is lighter than the Jetboils with their canisters of fuel. The only problem I have is I like to cook regular type meals. Now Jetboil has come out with the MiniMo which allows you to simmer on low heat as well as boil water. This opens a lot more options for a camp cook especially if you want to do more than boil water.
I have not decided which stove I will take on my hike, but I have 16 months to work this out. I plan to do at least one overnighter each moth and/or a multiday hike in the North Georgia between now and May 1, 2016, to test the different options I have. I will look at ease of use, weight, and how easy it is to obtain fuel. I hope those of you who are already on the trail will share information on your system. Until next time.

Ashley Pollette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479544,"It is amazing the number of hikers I have ran into who do not realize a great deal of the forest boarding the trail is second growth forest, but even more do not realize the lands along the AT once held communities, homes, and cabins of many early settlers. Many of their descendants continued to live in some of these areas until the middle of the twentieth century. It is hard to see where gardens, fields, and vineyards were located, but they were there. Right at the start the northbound hiker is walking along sites of long gone grist mills, churches, and schools. In the haste of counting miles per day we sometimes miss the beauty of the forest around us, not to mention the history of the people who once lived on the lands the trail occupies.",,People Were Here Before the Trail ,"Dec 29, Mon",0
Ashley Pollette,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480295,"Last Wednesday morning Wanda and I decided on the spur to head for North Carolina for a few days of waterfalls and short trails. Wednesday night I pulled up Trailjournals.com to check on the progress of Subman and to our delight he was in Franklin as well, and looking for a ride to Winding Stair Gap. After a few messages and phone calls we were set. Wanda and I picked Subman up at his motel and were on our way up to the gap early Thursday morning. I had the chance to ask about his equipment and how he was doing on the trail. He gave me a few pointers, but mostly we talked about the trail. At the trailhead we took a few photos and said our goodbyes. Later Subman sent us a gift (see picture above). I wish him good luck and pray for a safe hike.","
