Skip ahead if you want to get to the hike which starts in May 2015. I'm back!]A number of people have been asking if I have an online journal.

Carbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/339566,"Been having doubts about this, afterall I am 64 and not in the greatest shape. This past winter was nasty and difficult to get out even for a short walk. The past 3 weeks I have been doing short hikes in some hills for about an hour+ nearly every day. Still nowhere near the 6-10, or more, hours I expect to do on the AT each day.Then there are all the things and responsibilities I will be leaving behind. I'm probably overestimating the things that I take care of, but still there are things I do at home that, if not taken care of, will become bigger problems later.Sitting on top of all this is the fact that time passes so quickly as I get older. One, three, five years will pass so quickly. If I don't do this now I'm afraid I will lose the chance, and in five years I will be 69! I want to have at least one thing that stands out in my life as a unique accomplishment that ""takes my breath away"" when I reflect back upon it.",,Preparation at Home,"Mar 22, Tue",0
Carbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/339694,"Miserable weather this morning. Snow, rain, ice pellets and 38 degrees, but I still did the hour-plus training walk in the hills. By AT standards, these are tiny hills, but good enough to give the heart and legs a fair workout. I was also checking out my rain gear (again). The rain jacket is good for about an hour then gets clammy and cold on the inner surface. With two layers under the jacket I was ok, but started to sweat near the end and got cold when I stopped.Can't imagine being out on the trail in these conditions for hours, then trying to set up a tent and getting dry and warm, let alone eating and sleeping. The lesson I've learned over and over is to keep the sleeping bag and a 1 set of clothes dry - ALWAYS! Anyway, the warm shower at home felt good and made me think about how I must be insane to consider doing this.Been thinking about starting from GA instead of further north. Surgery is scheduled for April 12, I think I could start by April 20th at Springer and still be near other hikers.Thanks to those who made entries in the guest book.

Finally getting this surgery over in two days, I just hope it heals quickly so I can get on with things.Training hikes are going well. I can get through them without much effort compared to a month ago. The weather, although wet, is warming up enough for shorts and lighter upper layers. It's supposed to be in the upper 70’s at the DWG (Delaware Water Gap) and I will do a final day-hike up there tomorrow.During the next week I will be getting an itinerary together. The thing about doing this solo is that I have the flexibility to change plans to suit the moment. Other than myself, my main concern is the well-being of my wife while I’m away. I know she will appreciate her time to herself while I am off on this dream, but my plans will always be in tune with concern for her. I’ve been thinking maybe the best thing to do is not think. When I woke up this morning, I was thinking how can I give up this nice soft bed for attempting to sleep on the ground? Later, while drinking coffee I was thinking how can I give up this nice cushy chair for sitting on some damp log? Damn, I’m about to walk all day with 30+ lbs on my back, be cold, hot, tired, sore, thirsty, wet, dirty, stinking, hungry, and whatever else goes with this for 6 months! Why does this appeal to me?

The last hike I did was up at the DWG about two weeks ago, just to Sunfish Pond and back. Knew something was wrong since I had no energy on the return leg and had to stop a few times to rest. Anyway, feeling better and positive about the coming summer. Still looking forward to a few good section hikes. I figure with everyone getting a one-year notice, I should have a bit more support from the family for the thru starting next April (or sooner).I've been reading Big Dog's journal (we met last year on an AMC sponsored event at Mohican Outdoor Center), he's doing quite well and I'm amazed by the positive change I see in him through the photos he posted. We are about the same age so he is giving me great inspiration.Learning through failure and set-back hurts, but I'm allowing myself to take chances. Life has been patient with me, now it's my turn.

Carbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350081,The second round of surgery went ok. This is the second attempt in same area on my cheek to remove a melanoma. I’ve been doing some reading about this and getting a bit concerned. A few weeks ago I knew something was not right. I felt real tired from an easy hike and had to cut it short. A couple days later I came down with a case of shingles which can be brought on by a weakened immune system. Somehow I think all this is related. Anyway the shingles are gone and the 2nd surgery is done. Still waiting for the lab report. I’m thinking I should do this hike sooner rather than waiting until next April.I will head back up to the DWG later this week for a test day-hike just to see how I feel.

Carbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/355284,"It's been a while! Training has intensified and I've shifted into the hot-humid weather conditioning. For the past few weeks been doing local hikes in the smaller hills around here, about 4-5 miles per day. About 1-2 times a week I'm up on the AT doing either day hikes or an overnighter. Feeling much stronger, the heat doesn't bother me once I work up a good sweat and I'm actually losing some weight without much change in diet.I've resigned myself to the idea that the thru is not going to take place this year, so this all is preparation for a 2012 thru. Tomorrow I will be on the AT for yet another day-hike and hope to meet up with a friend who is doing his thru now and is coming north through NJ.In the next week or so I plan on leaving from High Point and heading north. I'll start off with a 3-day supply of food and just go from there. No schedule, just want to get a good feel for at least several days on the trail.

Hiked about 5 mi to the overlook where there is a pile of rocks, there is nearly a 360 degree view of the horizon. Today it was just a hot, humid haze with the temp in the lower 90's. The heat conditioning has kicked in because I felt reasonably comfortable once I was soaked in sweat. The wicking effect of the shirt, shorts, etc. kept my body temp in check. Carried 4 liters of water since this would be 10 dry mi, out and back, at a temp of 90+. Good hike, heat was not a big problem, glad I had the water though!","2012 Preparation

I figure if I start with a good bit of extra weight, and in reasonable condition, it will be a great way to come down to my recommended weight while being a little more comfortable with the start of the thru. Heck if I can just lose 30lb, that will cancel out the weight of my pack and I can effectively slack-pack the trail!Dream on...","2012 Preparation - MOC

Staying in shape has been a problem, but in moments of daydreaming I still go back to the AT.On a long weekend (March 24), I drove the 900 miles to Springer. I got to see a few hikers starting out on their journey. Stayed at the Lodge at Amicalola Falls, which is a great deal for $88. It included dinner and breakfast. I drove up the ""preferred"" northern route, a winding dirt road, to the parking area near the summit and hiked the mile to the start of the trail. Even picked up a pebble as if I were starting out on the hike to Katahdin.Overall a great experience. I still have the pebble. One day I will drop it off on Katahdin.

Carbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479607,"Planning on doing a flip, starting at Harpers Ferry NOBO in early May. Just got back from a road trip with my wife. We visited HF and spent the day walking around the area. Very historic and worth the 4 hour trip. We hiked a small portion of the trail leading north out of the town on a rail bridge with walkway, then on for a mile or so. Seeing the white blazes and imagining that in a few months I would be actually hiking the trail made me think I must be nuts. There is no way that I am underestimating the difficulty of this. Prep work is in progress. I'm walking about 4-5 mi nearly every day in the local hills with 30+ lbs. in my pack, not easy. Breaking in new boots for a backup.

In the past few months had a nasty winter with one snow storm after another, a melanoma surgery, followed by a ruptured tendon in my arm, but still on schedule to start the thru in a little more than 4 weeks, the first week of May 2015. Nearly gave up when I popped the tendon, but the docs said I should be ok with another month of physical therapy.Starting a flip-flop from Harpers Ferry heading north seems like a good way to avoid the crowd starting from Springer. At least I'll be closer to home if I need to bail out.My gear is all set to go. I managed to stay reasonably fit in spite of the recent problems. The support is there from my wife and family.

The plan is to start the hike going shelter to shelter, or not much more than 6 miles per day for the first couple weeks. My arm with the ruptured tendon is not a problem. Just can't imagine why there is no pain and still have good strength. Got to get this hike going before something else breaks! Four more weeks to go before hitting the trail in Harpers Ferry.I'll be using my 30+ year old external frame pack. I got a brand new Osprey 65 Liter internal frame with the ""Anti Gravity"" suspension, but returned it to REI when I ruptured the tendon... I never thought I would be hiking this year. Although the Osprey pack was very comfortable I had difficulty getting everything to fit. The external frame lets me hang the sleeping bag and tent outside the pack giving plenty of room inside for other stuff. I also like all the external zippered compartments that I didn't have with the Osprey. The old one squeaks and rattles a lot... good for giving the bears fair warning!","Ready to Go! Again

Fortunately I got to the shelter before the worst of it, but everything was damp, even my 'dry clothes' tucked in a plastic bag. The shelter was full and Ed arrived soaked. Somehow we were able to squeeze him in. Sleeping wasn't bad because the sound of the rain drowned out everyone's snoring and I was totally exhausted. Next morning Ed, who is usually the first one up, was still asleep as others were leaving. When he woke up he said something was wrong and he hadn't pee'd in two days. He looked like crap.

Last year's attempt (2015) turned into more of a good shake-down hike than a successful thru-hike.I never returned to continue the hike after leaving the 501 shelter in PA. While home I just got lazy. After a month or so the desire to return took hold and I have been prepping for this since then. Physically I'm in better shape, dropped about 20lbs and now have a better idea of what to expect with the mental and physical challenge and I'm ready for both. Only down-side is being a year older.

Carbo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526317,"I just wanted to note a few changes for this thru attempt based on what I learned last year:1) Switched to a free standing, Hubba NX 1, tent. Lighter than my older Zoid1 by 6 oz, provides quicker setup and gives me more head room.2) Carrying less water 2.0L vs 3.0L which will reduce weight by another 2+ lbs. I found plenty of water along the trail last year and always filter or treat all.3) Carrying less food, 4-day supply vs 5. Most resupply points were within the 4 day range.4) Not pushing as hard in the beginning to make the next shelter. Rest is more important than pushing for the miles.5) Weight down from 215 to 195lbs and in better overall condition than last year.Overall objective is to reduce pack weight (30lbs this year vs 37lbs last year fully loaded), provide easier setup and tear down for camp, and be in better physical condition BEFORE starting and just take it slow.

Mike has a phenomenal memory of the trails in the dozen parks where we hike and keeps us from getting lost. This, along with other daily hikes, has been my training regimen of about 35 miles a week for the past several months.
