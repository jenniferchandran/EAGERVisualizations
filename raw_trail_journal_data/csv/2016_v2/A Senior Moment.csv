A Senior Moment,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/515547,"You may be wondering, ""What's with the A Senior Moment trail name?""Well, please allow me to put it in the simplest terms possible with an explanation and a definition.As you know, just about everyone who hikes the AT has a trail name. They usually give themselves their own trail name, something that fits their psyche.Then again some hikers arrive on the AT without a trail name. They are eventually given one by other hikers. I don't want to risk anyone giving me a trail name given my idiosyncrasies or, worse my age. I could just imagine fellow hikers giving me the trail name, ""Bag of Bones"" or maybe ""Never Make It"" or God forbid, ""What a Laugh;"" then again, perhaps something more appropriate like, ""Older than Dirt!"" So, I came up with my own trail name: A Senior Moment. Here's the definition of A Senior Moment:A Senior Moment (def.) - noun (informal):A temporary mental lapse (humorously attributed to the gradual loss of one's mental faculties as one grows older)So there you have it - A Senior Moment - Hiking the Appalachian Trail!I must be crazy to want to hike the AT, especially with all those black bears around! Not to mention it's always raining on the AT. And there are ticks that carry Lyme's disease. It gets below freezing in the Smokies and hotter than blazes in Virginia. And there are mosquitoes and wild boars. And two-legged critters. Loads of feet-crunching stones in Pennsylvania. Pooping in the woods. Sleeping alone in the wild. And lightning storms on top of mountain balds. Did I mention there are bears? Perhaps I am crazy and having a temporary mental lapse. No matter. I enjoy the wild, and I'm always ready for one more adventure.Whether I hike 50, 100, 1000 miles or do the whole darned thing, nearly 2200 miles of it, I can always blame the idea of hiking the AT and everything that goes haywire on ""A Senior Moment"" ... right?",,View Entry,"Oct 10, Sat",0
A Senior Moment,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516312,More gear arrived in the mail today! Climbing carabiners to connect my Hennessy Hammock to the webbing straps (using a new technique); plus a wind shield for my alcohol stove. So far my pack w/o water is about 28lbs. Need to get it down a bit more.,,View Entry,"Oct 23, Fri",0
A Senior Moment,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516313,"Okay. Ordered another pair of trail shoes and have been breaking in a pair I bought a year ago. I had wanted to hike last year; however, with my daughter graduating from boot camp and my other two navy sons transferring from one duty station to another, I had to delay my 2015 hike.But I did have a memorable time taking AMTRAK cross country on two occasions and driving with my son to his new duty station in San Diego. All that was after he and I drove from Nashville, Tennessee to Seattle. Washington, his intermediate duty station.As a (I guess you can say ""former"") single parent of 5 children (over a 15-year period), I'm pretty proud of my navy offspring and my eldest son and daughter. (Yes, you read that correctly - single parent of ""five."")I've been scouring David Miller's AT Trail Guide (2015) version like there's no tomorrow. Can't wait until he puts out the 2016 version, so I can scour through it as well. Then it's time to annotate the new version using the notes from the 2015 version.Plus, I've been reading and re-reading books that focus on the AT and cruising the Internet for even more information. You would think that I had this all down pat by now. Nope. There's always more to learn.Had the pleasure of following lapoo99 on Instagram today. She completed her thru hike. Congrats! She - like so many others who have completed that Herculean achievement - are awesome! Lapoo99 you are my heroine! Indeed",,View Entry,"Oct 25, Sun",0
A Senior Moment,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516315,"As you can well imagine, along with my fellow 2016 AT hikers, I'm pretty excited about this upcoming adventure! That said, I plan to have a different approach when it comes to, as the saying goes, hiking my ""own"" hike.As a single dad of five turned author, my imagination tends to soar incessantly with absurdity; most of it fiction with a hint of facts from time to time. I publish my novels and short stories under a pseudonym. (No, it's not ""A Senior Moment."" The fact that I've written a few things is unimportant. What is important is this. As I trudge along with my fellow hikers I plan to take in the ""sights,"" for lack of a better word, as best that I can. And I hope to document things for prosperity and retell them in some fashion.Indeed, I'll have my share of struggles, probably more than others given my age. There's no denying it. And certainly I'll have ""a senior moment"" more often than not. It's inevitable. More importantly, I'll try to stay humble and upbeat. The AT deserves nothing less.Yet, what we do, my fellow AT hikers and I, as we hike the AT and share our experiences, trials, tribulations, and successes, will certainly warrant special recognition. After all, we will be sharing our lives from day to day, week to week, and month after month as we meander along the trail.Some of us will become friends, if only for a brief period of time, perhaps only overnight at a shelter. We will say hello, then goodbye, ""See you along the trail,"" then maybe hello once again as we hike our own hike at our own pace. We will see each other in town. Perhaps some of us will even share a bunk at a hostel, or maybe a round of drinks at a pit stop. All this despite our differences in ages, upbringing, culture, religion (or none), and the reason we're hiking in the first place - the list goes on.Yet, we will be one and the same. We will be AT hikers.I was in the Navy for 28 years. Saw and did a plethora of cool things and, for sure, saw and did things that weren't so cool. Catapulted off aircraft carriers and was lowered/raised from helicopters. Manged millions of dollars of stuff and hundreds of people. And, as I mentioned, I raised five kids over a fifteen-year period.Yet, despite my Navy experiences and single-parenting challenges, I guarantee you this: Those were nothing when compared to what I'm about to face along the trail, physically, mentally, and emotionally. I kid you not. What has come and gone before doesn't make a lick of a difference when it comes to hiking the AT.No matter. There's going to be much to learn, plenty to see, lots to hear, a bunch of laughs, and yes, undoubtedly some sad moments. In short, there's going be on helluva story to tell when it's all said and done.Should be interesting.",,View Entry,"Oct 26, Mon",0
A Senior Moment,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516395,"To be honest, I did not plan on posting anything today. I had planned to bring things up to date at the end of the week.On the other hand, I would be dreadfully remiss if I did not mention something notable.   In the brief span of less than one full day, five gracious people – virtual strangers mind you – took the time to post a note of support on my guest book.I thank Mamzy, JoAnn (and her husband), and my Navy shipmates, Jim, Shutterbug (and her retired Navy husband)...and a Marine (didn’t catch his name); for their heartening words.   Their kindness just goes to show how amazing the world in which we live.It was a wet one today, sandwiched between a constant drizzle and intermittent downpours. So, I thought, “What better time to test out a few of my precipitation essentials?”I donned a long-sleeve Dri-Duke™ moisture wicking shirt. It was an overkill I know (temperature was a balmy 58 degrees); however, I had never worn it and simply had to give it a go. I put on a lightweight fleece jacket on top of that and pulled on my rain jacket as the outer cover. Then I slipped into my rain pants. It was, in every respect, too much of a good thing. After twenty-five minutes I was perspiring, unsurprisingly I might add. But I put on a good show.Traveling eyes in passing cars on the country road must have thought me a bit crazy – if they happened to look up at my hill that is…a strange-looking man in a blue full-body cocoon traipsing up and down a water-logged hill in a deluge, seemingly with no purpose but to get wet. But what the hey – it’s me.I hiked up and down my hilly acreage for the better part of an hour. I also (deliberately) positioned my protected body beneath a cascading torrent of water on two occasions. I stayed as dry and cozy as a puppy in a child’s endearing embrace the whole time.More importantly, I had to give my right knee and my left hip joint a tryout. I intentionally have not exercised my lower extremities for two months, other than walking of course. The reason is simple enough. I was a professional floor guard at a local rink – skated upwards of 13, sometimes 18 hours a weekend; oftentimes 20 – 30 hours a week. I did this over a six-year period (with a break in 2014 to write my first novel).Not surprisingly, my knee and hip took a beating, I kid you not. So, I had to quit skating two months ago to see if that was the cause of my problems. Now (regrettably) all I have to do with roller skating is administering two roller skating rinks’ three each media sites. I miss the fun and the young people.“So, what’s the verdict?” you ask. “How goes the knee and hip joint?” Success! No pain, no problem, all’s good to go. A Senior Moment is ready for the AT! Hooyah!In closing: to those whom I mention above, and as I’ve stated in print on more than one occasion as a tribute to two wonderful youngsters in my life, I leave you with these touching words of wisdom:“Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive.” Dalai Lama XIVPlease have a good week … stay safe.",,View Entry,"Oct 27, Tue",0
A Senior Moment,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/517011,"Greetings! Another busy period. Still researching gear, particularly sleeping bags and backpacks. I have a 10-30-degree rated bag (depends on which side is up), but it's way too heavy. I also have a durable backpack, but that is also way too heavy (five pounds). Then again, they're already paid for, right?Purchased some additional cookware to go with my Trangia alcohol stove. Figured a couple of titanium goodies would go well with my plan to ""hike my own hike"" in style (i.e., comforts of home when it comes to eating hot meals). Also purchased an Esbit solid fuel tablet stove as a backup to my alcohol setup.More importantly, I now have my Hennessy Hammock 4-Season Super Shelter. It's designed as an undercover for my Explorer Deluxe Zip hammock. I intend to get the over cover and maybe a hex tarp this week. As I mentioned above, need some comforts of home (in this case - warmth!) especially when sleeping. I've been freezing cold many times before - even in my birthday suit; and it ain't much fun, I kid you not!Might go with an ENO underbelly gear sling, once I find out how much the rascal weighs. If anyone out there has used such a thing, please give me a shout with pros & cons & maybe ""what you think."" Thanks!A final note. A fellow hiker asked me to tell an occasional sea story. Okay. Speaking of being freezing cold in my birthday suit. My aircraft carrier was in Pusan, Korea for a port call. The temps outside (considering wind chill factor): less than 32 degrees. After we left Hawaii, the XO (second in command of the ship) said over the 1MC (intercom), ""We will not turn on the heat while in Pusan, except in berthing spaces. If we do, it will take weeks before we will be able to get the ship's air conditioners working properly for out next port-of-call, which is Singapore (1.3 degrees north of the Equator). So 'tough it up' as they say, and prepare for some freezing butt-cold showers for the next week.""I kid you not. Coming out of the shower stall in my birthday suit twice a day over a seven-day period - I saw my breath like it was winter. Popped goose bumps by the gazillions. Froze my unbending toes. Squealed like crazy. Jumped up and down while toweling. Ran like the dickens to my rack to hide (and thaw) beneath the covers for the longest time.The temperature inside the cold-conducting steel ship shower stalls was 39 degrees chilly! Added to that was the requirement to take a ""navy shower."" Get wet - turn off water. Lather while shaking. Then rinse, all while holding with panicky hands a push button shower gizmo to turn on/off the water!Yup - I've been shivering cold before, perhaps even close to hypodermic (well, at least it felt like it). Hence, I want to be warm in my cozy hammock. And sleep like a baby...","

A Senior Moment,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520234,"Like everyone else (hopefully), in training.Still undecided on my primary cooking method. I have a Trangia alcohol stove that's served me well over the years. Then again...My backup (emergency) cooking system consists of Esbit tabs on an Esbit .5oz titanium stove. Looking at JetBoil since it's all contained in one system. However, a bit concerned about the weight. Any suggestions out there?Gotta get a move-on - the AT awaits!",,View Entry,"Jan 26, Tue",0
A Senior Moment,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520454,"Okay - I tried it. Honestly. And I didn't like it one bit. So back to REI went my Osprey Exos 58. And welcome to Papa Osprey Atmos 65Yes, I know what some of you ultralights may be thinking. ""Ouch! It's heavy!"" Maybe, but it fits and it's comfortable - unlike the Exos 58 that hung on my behind. Bounce, slip, pull straps, etc, every 50 feet for 7 miles. Ugh!Also, bought a PocketRocket AND a JetBoil. So, let's take a vote. PocketRocket with my Ti pot, cup and w/Esbit .5oz Ti stove as a backup. Or, should we go with JetBoil (with its handy dandy coffee press ... I love coffee.) and Esbit stuff as backup? Any opinions? I hope so. I value them all (novice AT hiker I be).Before I close, a shout out is in order to Jeff from Virginia (USMC - Hoorah!). Don't cringe with the choice of my backpack, Jeff. Work with me *smiles*And a shout out to John from Syracuse, NY (I'm from Buffalo NY originally). And least we forget David from Kodiak, AK (A Triple Crowner! - way to go David). And Lee from Waynesville, NC.And a special shout out to SKC/SS (US Navy) Subman and Subs. And yes! To Spirit who did his thru hike at the young age of 63 four years ago! I'll be! And last but not least a special shout out to Cherre and her hubby, both retired Navy!Thanks for dropping me a line ya'll (That's southern talk ya'll).Later, and Happy Trails!",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Sat",0
A Senior Moment,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520476,"It's settled! I'm going with the Jet Boil. Many thanks for all the opinions and trail trusted-true reasons why! I value each and every one of your comments.I came up with a really cool way to use my Jet Boil w/o soiling its interior. (Pot clean up on the AT - hysterical cringe! I did enough of that - 1000's of times - while raising my five beloved rug-rats!). I'll share my ""style"" a bit later. Anyway...I was looking through some AT pamphlets the other day, when someone asked me if I was a thru-hiker. My typical response as a guy who never bites off more than (I'm certain) I can chew, I said, ""I'm hiking till I'm through.""Chagrin! ""Why bother then?"" came the retort from lips on a bewildered-looking face, its brow wrinkled sky high, nose and lips puckered in a squeamish pinch, dark blue eyes as big as tennis balls in a mindless sky.""After all, everyone knows Katahdin is the ultimate goal! Anything less is, like, why bother man? Not going from Georgia to Maine on the AT is so, well - it's so totally stupid!""Not wanting to go there, I simply replied, ""Yup,"" and strode out of the store with my hiking goodies in hand. As I did, a famous quote came to mind: ""Stupid is as stupid does."" Stupy-doo!Yes, Mount Katahdin may be the ultimate goal. For many, including me. But it's not necessarily the rule of thumb in all cases.The AT section hiker is but one exception to Stupy-doo's misguided decree. A determined thru-hiker wannabe who only made it so far, and had to opt out for one reason or the other (funds, injury, work/school, family) is another exception.Sure, I'll be ecstatic if I make all the way ""thru."" Who wouldn't be? What an accomplishment! Especially for an old codger like me. (In your face Stupy-doo!)While I'm optimistic I have what it takes, mentally, physically, and emotionally, I'm not going to lose focus on reality. Hiking thru is a definite challenge. Some make it. Many more do not. Hats off to those who do. Hats off to those who tried.I plan on taking in the scenery, shooting the breeze, snapping pics, living in the wild, interacting with wildlife, making friends, sort of ambling along in my own way - hiking my own hike as they say.I'll take it slow. Fast enough mind you, hopefully with ever-increasing footsteps per day, to get me to Baxter State Park before it closes for the winter. But only if that's in the cards. Frankly, if it stops being fun I'll need to slow my pace.Yes, you can bet there'll be no sprinting as fast as these wobbly, arthritic knees can travel. No records to conquer. No 25-mile ""Hey everybody - look what I did"" days. And, if I don't make it all the way, I'm not going to be disappointed.After all, I'm hiking the AT to experience a senior moment or two, hopefully many more. I'm hiking the AT till I'm through.","
