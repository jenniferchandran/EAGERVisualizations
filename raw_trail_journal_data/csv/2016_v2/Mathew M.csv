Mathew M,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524454,"“You are going to do what!?I am going to hike the Appalachian Trail. The whole thing.Why?...”I hear the question every time I tell someone what I am planning. Why? It is much easier to ask the question than answer it. Why hike for 6 months though the woods after selling or giving away a bunch of belongings so I can fit everything in a 10' x 15' storage unit? The answer... I need to get away for a while. Reset and recharge, find out who I am and what do I really want out of life. Not easy questions for almost anyone to answer but they are important questions to ask or we will end up following a path in life that is not fulfilling or happy.",,Why?,"Mar 22, Tue",0
Mathew M,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534274,"I often get the question ""Aren't you worried about bears?"" The answer to that question is quite simple. No. The chances I will have an interaction with a bear less than 50 ft from me is rather low. Most bears don't like humans and will run away into the brush. Many hikers see very little of bears. Now there are some things that greatly increase your chances of meeting one face to face. Not being careful of where you are placing your food scraps, food bag, trash, or are foolish enough to bring some midnight snacks into your shelter. So if I can avoid doing those things, the likelihood of a bear encounter is rather low.",,Bears,"May 21, Sat",0
Mathew M,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/534275,This should be an interesting night to see who will be at the party today. I have been fortunate to be able to see many of favourite customers that don’t come in very often. So I raise my glass to the great people I have met over the last two and a half years and hope to see you again in the future!,,Going away party,"May 21, Sat",0
Mathew M,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539223,"Katahdin... It is a crazy mountain to start your hike with. It rises to 5268ft and the 5.2 miles up the mountain don't count towards the mileage of the first day on trail. Katahdin was especially challenging for me due to the fact that we (Hellen, Morning Glory, Mosie Rosie, Breeze, and Mr. Clean (me)) tried to summit on the previous day. We were forced to turn around due to extremely dangerous weather on top of the mountain. The conditions were a constant 30 mph wind, 50+ mph gusts, rain, and rather chilly temperatures at the base of the mountain. The calculations for the wind chill showed that it was about 14 degrees at the beginning of the boulder scramble and close to 5 to 7 on top of the mountain. The people who were successful with their summit were coming down with ice in their beards, hair, and backpacks. One person had to pee on his hands to defrost them on top of the mountain because he had lost all feeling in them. We turned around before we got into a situation that serious but it was really emotionally crushing to have made it almost to the halfway point only to be forced to turn around and hike back down the mountain. Shockingly the next day was slightly better weather and we made our second attempt at Katahdin. It was a very long hard scramble up the mountain. I had rolled my left ankle the previous day and smashed my knee into a rock as well. I was incredibly sore and did not at all think I was going to make it up that monster. With the help of Mosie Rosie and Breeze, I was able to keep trudging up the mountain towards the summit. The climb just never seamed to end. There was never an end to the tree line, then the boulder scramble, then the false plateau up top, then more climbing... It is the mountain that never ends! Finally after about six hours of climbing I finally reached the summit!!!! It was in the clouds and there was no view to be seen. I made it ahead of Mosie and Breeze and enjoyed the summit to myself for about five minutes. They finally emerged from the fog and I was able to tell them that they were finally here! We were able to celebrate on top of the mountain for about 30 minutes before the weather started to chase us off the summit and turn our decent from challenging to rather dangerous. We did get trail magic at the summit. We met a climber who what climbing all the highest points in the United States. Potato chips, crispy M&Ms, and packs of trail mix were offered and graciously accepted! The climb down included much more sliding and scooting than walking. The boulder scramble on the way down the mountain was especially terrifying with an inability to see the hand and foot holds it was quite challenging. We nevertheless made it down the mountain and completed the first 5.2 miles of the Appalachian Trail! A time of 12 hours from start to finish hiking Katahdin... one CRAZY mountain!Mr. Clean","Northern Terminus of the Appalachian Trail

Mathew M,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539233,"Today was a really hard day for me. Up to this point I had never really been away from loved ones for very long. I think back and can't think of a period of time longer than three days when I didn't see my family, friends, or dog. Today was going to be officially the longest I had every been away from the people and dog that I love dearly. I was missing home hard and it was about to push me off trail when I got to Abol Bridge. I was just looking for a phone with signal to call home and talk to my family. I was so distracted while walking that I fell fording a river and landed on my left hip right onto the SPOT gps tracker my family wanted me to take and bruised my hip quite bad. I fell really hard on the boulder after a slightly misplaced foot rock hopping across the river. The injury did not help my spirits and just compounded with my injuries from Katahdin. I was really fortunate to run into Got Away that was hiking a bit faster than me and stopped her to ask some advice about the trail. She had some good advice to offer me about home, the trail, and trail life. She is super positive even though she fell down a mountain and tore something in her knee so she flip flopped to go southbound and give herself more time to finish the trail. She is a wonderful person to have met on the trail and she kept me from getting off by being super encouraging and giving great advice about the hardships that happen at the beginning of the trail.Mr. Clean","Katahdin Stream Campground

Mathew M,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539742,"The 100 mile wilderness... It is quite a place to be. Very rarely do you pass any type of road and never a paved road. It is really strange and disconcerting to transition from my old life to the new woods life. Everything is different. As soon as you get out of your warm hammock or sleeping bag you are assaulted by the shocking and surprising cold and are left thinking ""Damn it is cold this morning!"" There is no shower in the morning to help you wake up and get going for the day. There are no showers unless you are willing to brave the very cold mountain stream or the slightly but not much warmer ponds and lakes. Your stink stays with you day in and day out, each day getting worse as you pour sweat out during the accent of each mountain trying desperately to not drink all the water you have been carrying up the mountain so you have some for the decent. The trails are rocks, roots, and muddy with a few spots of nice trail thrown in there to give you a shadow of hope. 
The 100 Mile had a number of challenges for me that really put into question whether I wanted to stay on trail. The first and perhaps most important is that I was missing home pretty darn bad. I am very much not accustomed to being so far (1100+ miles) from home and being away for more than three days at a time. I felt a severe ache to go home and be with my family and friends. I can't really put into words just how low and depressed I was feeling. But it is part of the challenges that come with taking a six month adventure far from home. The second challenge was my food drop that wasn't where it was supposed to be and I couldn't find it at all. I was pushing a longer day to try and hit a shelter so I could have a shorter hike the following day. The food drop that I got was through Old Man at the Appalachian Trail Lodge and was setup to be at mile 63 SOBO just past Crawford Pond at Kokadjo-B Pond Rd (which is not called that on the Maine maps that some guys had). So I spent about an hour looking for my food drop, reading and rereading the directions over and over again to make sure there was no way that I could be getting the directions wrong. I searched and searched the entire area through the woods looking in any possible place it could be hidden. No success. I had no cell phone signal so I couldn't call or text Ole Man. I was having quite the hard time with it. I was down to about two days of food and there was no way I would be able to make it through the next 50 miles with the food that I had with me. Fortunately there happened to be a truck that was driving down the gravel road and I kinda did the please stop dance almost in the middle of the road and they were kind and stopped. They had a map of the roads and we spent about 10 minutes discussing the fact that the directions don't make sense because B-pond Rd was not even close to where we were standing. They offered to give me a ride to their fishing lodge where they have a cell phone signal booster that I could use to try and get a call to Ole Man. So I climbed into the bed of the pickup and we headed a couple miles down the road. When I got to the Lodge I met Barry and his wife the couple that manages the lodge since the cabins are all privately owned. They were very kind and understanding of my situation. I was unable to get a call or text though my phone using their booster but there phone worked and I gave Ole Man a call and got the correct directions to my food drop and gave him a talking to about getting rid of the bad directions that he was giving out and making sure anyone with the wrong directions would be notified where the food drop was auctualy located. So now that I had correct directions it was back to the trail to see if the directions were accurate this time. Barry the manager gave me a ride back to the trail but not before getting a whole bunch of trail magic! Four bananas, two apples, two clementines, four chocolate chip cookies, and the truely special item, a beer from the guys who picked me up originaly!!! That was some wonderful trail magic in addition to being able to contacts Ole Man and find my food. 
To be finished typing. Had to walk away to take care of resupply. Will finish soon.
