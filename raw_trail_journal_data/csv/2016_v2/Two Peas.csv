Two Peas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520002,"Down to 22 days tomorrow....today we worked on trail prep; as we have been doing for several months. I spent some time weighing new arrivals and I also put a few stitches to our mircofiber trail towels, so they don't fray away(very large, so we cut them in half and to cut weight) Big Cypress worked on his pack, testing equipment and starting to load boxes for mailing to ourselves. We've been reading the journal of SlipKnot, he started hiking north already. We wonder if we will see him along the way?! Praying he's prepared for this big blizzard getting ready to hit the east coast. As a matter a fact, hopefully WE are prepared well enough for a very snowman-esque hike?! We've planned and planned and re-planned, and Farmers Almanac says above normal precipitation for the east coast in 2016....we will soon find out!

They are sleeping in the tent tonight, and will attempt to put their sleeping bags together tonight to keep warm. It is very overcast and hard to see. Moonbeam said it is freezing mist. Sunday they started at 9:05 and made it to shelter by 2pm. Today they left around 9:15 and made it to shelter by 3pm so they are making good time.

Two Peas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521314,"Today we got up after a good sleep in rain. Hiked a good hard hike up and over Blood Mountain. We even tested our crampons/spikes on the snowie ice on rocks on the mountain. They worked great, no slipping, grip like Velcro. It was absolutely gorgeous up there and had our lunch snack in the sparkling trees with Frozen mist on them. Near the summit is we're the snow was in plenty, but the sun was shining and melting it. Highest point in GA today, 4457 feet. That's the picture for today. We were going to camp about a mile past Neel Gap, but once we went to the Mountain Crossings Hostel, we decided to get warm, get clean and sleep in a bed, but mostly shower. There's a mom, son & daughter from Indiana. Holden (giftshop) said he was going to be the first autistic teen to thru hike. Then while we were getting showers, who shows up, Pete & Jackie now with trail names. Rabbit & Snot. Cuz he's really fast & she's got runny nose. Nick is now 4K cuz of video equipment.

Two Peas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521529,"We were the first group to fill the Mountain Crossing Hostel for the season last night. Pretzel was pretty happy & even helped me with a pack adjustment. We bought candy, soda and a head lamp. Slept really well considering, snoring hikers. I wore ear plugs. We slept in bunk beds, Big Cypress took top bunk. Dried our gear. Left the hostel at Neel Gap, US 19 in Georgia @ 7:35 am. I was not feeling well & grouchy, we met Rooster, Alex on side of the road resting feet. Then Rabbit & Snot arrived, we hiked a brutal zig zag switch back after the stop then we all took lunch/snack break and stopped to filter water @ noon. Streams are 2 inches deep some times so a challenge to collect. Continued on straight ups & downs to finish, after meeting local day hiker Gaphopper @ Low Gap Shelter at 3:30 pm. The gangs all here, some in shelter, some in tents. We hiked 11.5 and I fell after lunch, didn't pick my foot up high enough over a log at water spot (still on the blue blaze), but no injuries, sticks and the log & pack saved me. At camp now, owl is hooting to neighbor owl. Made a camp fire for hot water for cheesy rice meal. Foot care done, all food bags hanging and @ 6:57 we are all tucked into our home (tent) sleeping with our hiking clothes at the bottom of our bags for warmth and to keep the stink away from our faces. That's even after a shower at the hostel yesterday. Plus, sleeping with your clothes helps them dry for tomorrow. 
The weather was amazing today. About 50 degrees and some snow patches on the colder sides of mountains. Lots of mud along the trail. Gotta watch for slippage.
Good night.","Neel Gap

Two Peas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521530,"Feb 19Started at Low Gap Shelter this morning, left 9:20 am. The ""family"" (our hiking family) was all there last night. Rabbit, Snot, Rooster, 4K, Slipper & Tripper. Along with T to the R, and his Son & Dog, Baily.Beautiful day, bright sunshine & blue sky. Chilly, but still cold in parts. Depends on what side of the mountain we are on. Hiked in Light Weight long sleeve merino wool and still very sweaty with temps in the 30's.Trail was icy in areas, that was scary, but as long as we rock hopped it was ok. Just about to the Blue Mtn Shelter was our water source, a trickle but it worked. The young ones of our family were at the shelter and everyone but us decided to stay. It was @ 3880 ft elevation & windy. We decided to press on to a stream and stealth camp there. Wow, we got a work out in that 3 miles. A lot of steep ups and downs. We saw several day hikers, including 2014 thru hiker, Wild Child she high fived Big Cypress and cheered us on. Stealth camping near the stream, arriving at 4:30 pm it was beautiful, but with no level ground in site, we kinda slept in a ditch and on a slant. Feet first, kept sliding off our pads all night. But, since we were in the ditch we stayed very snuggled to each other and warm. Serenaded by the stream under the almost full moon. We saw a lot of moss today and green tree tunnels.Critters we heard Owls. Saw Blue Jays, a Gray Squirrel, 2 lil spiders crossing the trail and a crazy looking caterpillar thing. It was black with 3 or 4 reddish orange half circles along its sides.Total miles today 10.5","Low Gap Shelter

Two Peas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521531,"Started at the stream this morning at 8:35 am. Our first 5 miles were challenging, but not bad with gradual ups & downs. No views at all, as we walked in the foggy mist ALL day. Stopped on the trail a few steps from Tray Mountain Shelter, where we were out of the wind and had lunch. Well, we packed real full blown lunches, but haven't eaten one. Instead, having our snacks and a stretch and moving on. Right as we were putting our packs on after our break, a group of about 6 women day hiking, stopped to chat. Everyone usually asks, when you meet someone along the way, ""how far ya going?"" We say Maine or all the way. They were excited for us & talked about GA being the hardest of the 14 states, cuz of the Ups & Downs!! Second 5 miles for the day, some straight-aways, where we could just zoom, then some gradual ups & downs again. Met, Tuna Splatter, a previous attempted thru hiker from last year. He was very inspiring. Very overweight, from seditary life since he had to be rescued by 27 people when he fell & break his foot on the AT. He has all sorts of metal in there now, but still chugging along. Then, we met a trail maintainer. Told him we loved him and he was very much appreciated for all his hard work.Arrived at Sassafras Camping spot @ 3:30 pm. It's flat !!!! Yah, sliding off our pads. Set up our house, Big Cypress got water from the very bottom of a deep ravine, so with drinking water set, we decided to eat more snacks & skip real meal dinner. So, we don't have to get more water for boiling. Save it for breakfast. Rabbit, Snot, Rooster & 4K all showed up, we chatted. ""They were worried they wouldn't see us again."" ""They like us."" They thought we got so far ahead they wouldn't catch us. Well, they are much younger & faster. So....They decided to press on to Deep Gap Shelter. Then we are all going into the town of Hiawassee, after stopping in at Top of Georgia Hiking Center. To stay in a hotel for a couple nights.","Stream

Our son Patrick is our trail boss, so when we called him, he told us that Big Cypress dad had a heart attack. He's currently in the hospital & preparing for a quadruple bypass, on Wednesday. We spoke to dad today, as we are in Hiawassee GA for two nights, with Okay cell reception. He's in good spirits and didn't want us to know, fearing we would leave the trail and go home. We are very thankful to Patrick & Amanda for telling us!! So.....Prayers are appreciated for dad, mom and our families. Thank you all so very much. Events for today. We woke at Sassafras Gap at 63.3 miles in, on our journey. It was very misty & damp. We packed up and had our trail super charged oatmeal, hit the trail at 7:45 am. We went from 3500' elevation to 4126' in a short & abrupt run @ Kelly Knob and skirt the summit. It was hard going.... We try & ""take it down a gear"" & take baby steps, and just keep chugging along. It's slow but at least forward movement! Attempted to beat the impending rainstorms expected at 11. Only rain & it started at about 12:15!! We made it, yippy!! 6.3 miles today & Bodies in need of a break.We arrived at Noon @ Top of Georgia Hostel. We were greeted by Vanilla, Buttercup and Owner Bob, AKA Sir Packs A Lot. Visited with Chris & Ella. Tuna Splatter & his buddy were there already, as well as Rooster, Rabbit, Snot & 4K (but they were at the grocery in town already). Bob shuttled us to our Mull's Motel at about 2 pm. We wanted a private bath & bed. Miss Darlene said there was a couple excited to meet us, as she told them Two Peas was staying the night also. It was Subman & Suds. She knocked on their door & we chatted & made a Daniel's dinner date. Also, Connecticut thru-hiker Rabbit suggested eating at Daniel's AYCE. He passed us on Kelly Knob this morning. We called home, got a few items at the grocery, one being Epsom Salts....oh glorious heaven, soaking & getting un-stinky!! Subman & Suds headed to eats & left us a note (see pic). Visited with them & Rabbit. Very nice folks, we exchanged numbers. As they are getting off the trail for couple days, tending to boo boo finger on Rabbit & blistered toes on Suds.

Purged about a medium flat rate box. We arrived with about 3 days of last weeks food, so that went to the hiker box. We also donated another couple days of food to the box, we aren't eating lunch, no reason to carry it around.Jason from TOG hostel picked up our packs, took them to the hostel, as we are staying there tonight. We walked around town, looking for headlamp, scotch guard, seamstress to add Velcro to our sleeping quilts. She wanted a $1.50 an inch. That's would have cost as much as just buying new bags that zip together! So, we got roll Velcro at Hiawassee Hardware, sewing stuff at Ingles Grocery, they even had a hand held battery opp Singer ""machine"". So, several hours later, our bags can become one, without the big air vents we had before. All that while our laundry got done. $5 a load, wash n dry for you. While we wear scrubs provided!!

We slept pretty good last night, it was cold and frosty. Ready to go and breakfast in tummy by 8 am. While we were eating, Highland Dave walked up! We shared our good morning grits with him, because he hasn't eaten a hot meal for few days. Cold foo/snacks get old after a while I'm sure. We called into Franklin & Zen picked us up at Rock Gap road at about 10 am. While we were waiting Tyler walked up so the four of us jammed ourselves & our packs into Zen's little hatchback car!! Warm & Dry!! Our gear has been wet from Bly Gap, then 2 more days of rain & snow!! And the fact we have had a tent venting issue. We keep getting condensation inside. We know that we need to Vent more!! Zen ran us & Dave to AYCE Chinese Buffet. It was delicious! We were still stinky hikers, but nobody passed out when we walked by.(Tyler walked to McDonald's). I ate 2 plates & then ate one full plate of fruit & it was perfectly ripe!! Then we walked across the parking lot to the Wal-Mart. Zen has been doing our laundry and we are drying our gear. Got Nice Hot Showers & then Mending our sleeping bags. The Velcro we ""stitched"" in is not holding, so we are hand whip stitching. So we can stay warm when it fridgade temps. Zen then also ran us up to Outdoor 76. We got hand warmers & a new cook stove. The water is just taking too long to heat in these cold temps. So we are using a lot of fuel to get warm not hot water. So....hopefully this system will work better.So....6:12 pm now, pizza on the table, stories being told and nice time being had. Oh yes, and puppy love too. Zen has 3 dogs!! Ok I know this is a long post, but I forgot to add. We walked past Rock Gap Shelter, it's Closed!! Tree fell on it 2 nights ago. Five hikers were in it & ALL ok.

Two Peas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522173,"Woke at 7 am after a glorious night sleep at Gooder Grove Hostel, Franklin NC. Visited with Zen (owner of the hostel), Highland Dave, Tyler aka Rusty (last name Potts, he said his dad wanted that to be his given name and his mom said no way, so he's using it for trail name). Had breakfast, Cocoa Pebbles and Orange Juice & coffee. Big Cypress did up the sink full dishes for Zen. We got showers and packed up. Then the male bonding began. Zen, is a martial arts guy and he and Big Cypress were showing some basic techniques to Dave & Tyler. We all wanted to hang out longer, but we needed to get on the trail. We really feel that Zen is the nicest & is greatest host, we've met so far!! Right before hitting the road, Teardrop walked up. We met him at Top of Georgia, working for Bob. Anyway, we dropped Highland Dave at breakfast joint. Then on the way to our start spot, picked up Going Postal. He was needing a ride from Winding Stair Gap & in need of a hostel. Packs on and walking, after pictures for Zen @ 10:30 am. Mile 106.1 Rock Gap. Today's hike was a lot of straight ups and elevation changes. TOUGH! But we had a good day. Met some day hikers and trail maintainers From Nantahala Hiking Club. They care for 68 miles of trail. They took our picture and we moved on at about 5:15 pm. Insteaded on staying at a campsite with water, but somehow missed it. (that seems to be a problem for us in NC) so.....pressing on we came in Hot to the Wayah Bald Shelter at dark (about 7 pm), had to use headlamps to set up our ""house""!!   We did think that God had it all planned out, cuz Wayah Bald Stone building had an amazing glow of pinks & purples at sunset we stopped for two seconds to enjoy & take a couple pics!! No other people in sight there or at the shelter. Big Cypress got water, I set up the tent. He had more excitement, while getting water the coyotes were whimpering and scurrying around the water source area where he was!! I forgot to mention I saw a field mouse or shrew scurry across the snow the other day and also saw bunny prints that day! Tummies are full with Chicken Veg Curry Couscous, hot cocoa and peanut M&M's. Left the empty candy bag open & tucked under my shoe, the mouse wasted no time investigating it. 14.7 miles today and we were only really planning 9. Happen this way for a reason, wondering if we'll know why. Kinda like sleeping at Glassmine Gap. Didn't plan that, didn't plan on seeing Highland Dave that morning or Rusty, didn't plan on going into Franklin or staying in a hostel there, but....We did & have great new friends & memories from it.","Rock Gap

They woke extra early to see view from Wayah and then press on. We got on trail at 8:55 and had an ups & downs kinda day. High peaks and straight ups. Beautiful views! Big Cypress even saw Clingmans Dome From the Wesser Bald tower, so clear you could see the Smokie Mountains. I on the other hand, didn't climb the tower, I was recovering from the step climb and low blood sugar/hunger. I hit a wall and really struggled. I told Big Cypress, I felt as though I have never hiked, ever!! So, while Big Cypress, Rabbit, Suds & Subman enjoyed the view I had a cliff bar and water. Plus, called for private room at the NOC tomorrow night. We met some day hikers today. As well as our first SOBO hiker, Rookie. He started July 14 at Kathadin. He's from Maine and is going back to summit July 14, 2016 to celebrate the one year anniversary. He was sporting a 7 month, length beard, it was impressive!! Decided to go to the last shelter right before the Natahala Outdoor Center. It's A Rufus Morgan Shelter at mile 136.3, only 1 mile to the NOC tomorrow. Pleasant evening for camping and nobody else at the shelter, so......We had lunch snack at Cold Spring Shelter, it's right On The Trail. No extra hiking in or out!! So, nice!!Rabbit, Subman & Suds were there also. Rabbit took our picture. We signed the book. Yesterday, 4K, Rabbit (Michigan), Rooster and couple others were there. They signed it the ""near miss"" group. They were the ones in the Rock Gap Shelter, when the trees fell on it!! Hope we see them tomorrow!! No critters today, only heard some crows as we got near our camp for the night!! Bodies are sore!! Feet complaining and knees too, we went from highest elevation of the day 5080' down to 2184' at this shelter tonight. But.....there were a lot of ups & downs, the knees hate the downs!! We just got a shelter mate, Mustard. At 8:18 pm, he did some headlamp hiking. Going to the NOC tomorrow for few days.

Pacemaker is working and heading home today. His Dr. told him that he lost him on the table during operation, but was able to recover. Dr. said he hasn't lost a patient in 30 years!! Praise the Lord dad wasn't the first!!We woke with the light of a new morning!! 6:45-ish!! Nice to see Mustard's face. He arrived at dark, so we couldn't see his face and we were already tucked in, only a voice in the dark. Left camp at 8 am, hiked only 1 mile into the campus of the Nantahala Outdoor Center. Nice jaunt over several streams & footbridges. We reserved a private room at the hostel for tonight. Hanging out in the restaurant, until we can check in. We hit the restaurant by 9 am. Got the Class V breakfast. Three eggs, toast, homefries, bacon, French toast/pancakes.....you betcha ....We ate it ALL! We've been waiting for our ""hiker appetites"" to kick in. Big Cypress's started yesterday, mine is still hiding. The NOC is a very pretty area. @ crossroads of US 19 & 74. The Nantahala River flows right thru campus. They have lots of activities here. Kayak, rafting, zip line etc....10am, Rabbit (from Connecticut) and Subman & Suds just arrived for breakfast. They aren't staying, gonna continue to Stecoah Gap. Then taking a break.Well, we realize we didn't make a big deal on our journal, over crossing over into NC & 100 mile mark. We did take a picture...but we were pressed for time & daylight, missed the shelter we planned to stay at and was fighting the cold of the evening. That's our biggest obstacle as of this entry. COLD!! Hard to set up or pack up camp with frozen fingers!! Couple mornings we had to breath hot breath on our tent pole connections, cuz they were stuck together!!

We took some pictures, half the scene was snow covered peaks, that were at a lower elevation. I even took a panorama pic. But, not a pretty sight on the way there!! Moonbeam....had a very rough, emotional day!! Yes, tears involved, but not for long, as falling or tripping likely. The struggle was those darn false summits and the relentless straight ups!!! I needed oxygen and I wanted my body to work harder, but it wouldn't cooperate. I was just a darn hard day and my mind was telling me I'm not ready for the Smokies and its just not the case.We saw Going Postal today. He caught us at a yucky rock scramble and continued on.

We stopped for a snack and rest a moment at a road crossing and Mustard showed up. He threw some trash away, as there was a bear proof trash container and also had a snack & moved on. We didn't pitch trash, as we didn't have much and it was packed up....not worth digging it out. Whenever we cross a road or go into a gap, which the later is OFTEN, we have to get out of the gap....that means UP! Sometimes with switch backs, that make it a lil easier, sometimes not. Today was a not kinda day. We climbed something called Jacob's Ladder. We survived it and something I've been saying along the way once we passed a really hard or yucky spot, thank God for getting us thru it and thank God we never have to do that ever again!! We arrived at Cable Gap Shelter at about 4:30. Passing by Mustard hunkered down at Cody Gap flat camp spot. He set up camp there. I had been praying all day for Jesus to allow us to make it to Cable and set up the tent Before the rain!! See today was supposed to be 90% rain and 48°. Nonetheless of that happen. It was around freezing all day and no rain only snow!! Snowed about a half inch. But.....guess what no rain and tent set up in No Rain!! Thank you Jesus!! We know we will be setting up our tent in the rain in this several months long journey, but the more we can avoid it, the better!! The water source was very close to shelter/camp. We like that, makes life better. Sometimes water is half mile away (one way). We dined on Clam Chowder and Mediterranean Couscous. Thanks to our two cookbooks & the wonderful recipes, we used to meal prep at home. We are finally getting more of an appetite. All tucked in and ready for sleeps and it starts raining!!

It had to have been a whole army of mice. Lots of noise from them scurrying around and poop....oh yah lots of poop! Yucky!!We had eggs for breakfast, packed up and on the move by 9 am. Hiking was slightly easier, mild ups and downs. One biggish climb and long downs into Fontana Dam area. The downs are hard on the knees, trek poles help with that, but only to a degree. We arrived at the Fontana Marina road crossing and shuttle spot at about noon. Going Postal and couple other hikers were there! They just got dropped off and were urging us to hurry, get the shuttle while he's still there!! The next 1.1 miles to Fontana Shelter is up up and more up and tough, they said. ""Take the shuttle to Fontana Village, stay at the Lodge and rest up for the Smokey Mountains. The lodge has restaurant and good food."" So...We did!! Here we are!! Nice room and good eats and laundry clean by 4:30. We went to the Pit Stop gas station. Met up with Capt. Ahab, Medic/Squeakers and Fiber (all from FL). We were all the NOC together, but they moved on before we did. So...since its still early in the season some things are not open or available. We needed to pick up some hand/foot warmers and C2032 batteries for Big Cypress Petzel headlamp. We struck out on both.....almost! Fiber and a gentleman named Paul that asked us about the phone service earlier, both hooked this lil Moonbeam up with the toe warmers!!! Yippy Hurray!!! Battery will have to wait I guess.

Especially since the weather called for Tstorms.    At the shelter tonight - the 3 of us, 38, Candle Maker, Capt Underpants, Ally and her friend (name withheld)""Patient Zero""-first one to get the Spewmagedon 2016, Steady & Teach (are shelter adjacent, camping few steps from trail in tent area across from shelter) and some section hikers.Ok What We've Learned1. If your pole doesn't move, Stop!! Or Snap!! & Hiking Poles are helpful in preventing falls!!2. Sleep with Saywer to prevent freezing and illness. We switched to Pool shock to sanitize our water. 6-7 granules to 1 liter. Then add Electrolytes. Same or easier than Aquamira.3. Crampons worked great when snow & ice on trail. Helps us move faster. Switching to Yak Traks for Mtn Ranges north of Smokies. Due to weight reasons.4. Baby steps or half steps when going up hill, especially in early days of starting to hike. Focus on breathing too!!5. Ladies....the pee spout is amazing!! More discreet and no pack removal needed!! Especially easier on knees, as no bending necessary!6. Knees...use the poles when going down hill to help save your knees.7. Vent vent vent....your tent!! Prevents condensation on bag & tent walls. We leave half front wide open and complete foot area open. With both sides vented to max.8. Baseball Cap....keeps Sun out of eyes and rain!! Especially the rain!!9. Start out hiking Cold (in cold weather) as you WILL be sweating in matter of minutes. 10. Handkerchief...for sweat and noses and under baseball cap to block Sun from ears & neck.11. Rocks, expect it to Move or Be Slippery!! 12. Walk in your same clothes & socks wet or dry. Sleep in DRY clothes & socks only (best to have 1 set to hike - 1 set to sleep). 13. Thank God for....Gold Bond, mini roll on Warm FX (like icy hot), K Tape, Ibuprofen, EmergenC, Cliff Bars, Babywipes & Dr Bronner's soap.14. Select a Size Paper Towel, (packed with daily meals)one per day for Privy calls. Followed by hand cleaning with baby wipe! 15. Norovirus NOT killed by Hand Sanitizer!!! Only Soap & Friction!!16. Breakfast & Dinners warm - lunch - snacks all day, every couple hours is best.17. Don't touch the shelter pen when signing the shelter book. Risk Norovirus, bring your own pen.18. ALWAYS check hiker boxes!!19. Tenting is warmer than the shelter, in cold temps!20. Wright Socks are great for preventing blisters!!21. Compression Bags are amazing!! We bought Granite Gear brand two weeks in....l o v e them!22. In cold temps Mittens can be put on feet for added warmth, yes we did! 23. In cold temps Toe Warmers are amazing and Much lighter than Hand Warmers.24. In cold...blocking the wind is or more effective to keep you warm. Even in the teen temps we hiked with merino wool long under wear and REI full zip wind/rain pant and comfortable!! 25. Balaclava's are great upside down when undecided about temps from one mountain side to other. In cold temps to cover ears, chin & nose then just neck.26. Ticks are out All Year!! Check check check. Use sit pad instead of right on the ground!! Advice From Miss Heather Brave. 27. Foot Care daily checks are necessary!! K Tape must be smooth or will cause friction on healthy next door neighbor toes.28. Trail Meals - variety is better - you will get bored!29. Put your damp clothes in sleeping bag with you at night for dry or dry-ish clothes in morning.30. Hang your food & toiletries, NOT to protect your food, but to protect the bears!!!! Nuisance bears Do Get Euthanized!! 31. Unzip your zippers, the mice Will Chew holes just to take a look or for crumbs!! Especially Shelter Sleeping.32. Merino wool clothes stink way less than synthetic!!Critters: Squirrels and various birds - the usual suspects AND butterflies that were attracted to Fiber's pack when we stopped to water/snack and soak feet in spring. Butterflies were ""licking"" the salt and minerals off pack straps!! Yes they were!!

We ALL had breakfast at the Smoky Mountain Diner. Steady and Teach (Angela & Zack) arrived first, as they got an earlier start and a good morning surprise by a skunk. No stinky problems, but too close for comfort! 38 and Candle Maker, Fiber had a table with us and we really packed it in!! Food that is!! Fiber ordered double breakfast, thought he couldn't manage to eat it.....but didn't have that problem and I actually finished my meal before Big Cypress, that never happens!!PS I like being in the ""bible belt""....bathroom has bible open to Psalm. Hotel rooms have bible out on table, not tucked in the drawer. Scripture written on the walls of businesses!!! Nice and refreshing!!After breakfast we walked the AT Thru the town of Hot Springs, permanent metal AT emblem embedded in the sidewalks here as trail goes right thru town. Checked in to our sleeps for next couple nights at Iron Horse Station & Restaurant. Ray, got us into a jacuzzi room for tonight....at this posting 9:40 pm, we've taken 4 soaks and Fiber, who's room is next to our bathroom (shares a door), took a soak. We unlocked the door so he could soak and then just let us know when he was done so we could lock our bathroom door backup. Thanks to Suds & Subman, who we also saw today and visited with for a while off & on, we took Epsom Salt soak, as they had a lot extra and are heading out tomorrow.Met up with Suds & Subman and even Steady & Teach showed up, at the art gallery/ice cream shop, right next door to the Inn. We had Mint chocolate ice cream and ....wine!! Had a nice time, Then.....We all shopped at the Bluff Mountain Outfitters, they really have what ya need!! And then some!! Big Cypress got new gloves, his wool liners are wearing holes, as are mine, but I love them and didn't find a suitable replacement. We sent home our micro spikes for snow & ice and replaced with lighter Yak Trax....just in case. We've heard there is snow in mountains 50 miles from here. Not sure if these warm temps are at 5500-6000 feet elevation also. But....for $20 and very little added weight, worth the piece of mind. I got a compression sak for my clothes, my bag that my quilt came in has been working, but I'm really giving it a work out and the seam looks like it might say ""uncle"". Not intended as a heavy duty stuff sak, only a feather quilt bag, so I understand. I also got a knee support brace, highly recommended by Suds & Subman. My left knee is really hurting on the downs. They each have same problem, used the support and no issues after few days. So....praying it works!!Got all our laundry done, it's so convenient....directly across the street. Had a pizza cooked in brick oven at Spring Creek Tavern. Delicious!! Dinner at Iron Horse we ribs, steak & sweet muscadine wine from Duplin Winery, right here in NC. Again....Delicious!!Update trail journals and thank you everyone for prayers, guest book signing and encouragement!! Extra special thanks to Miss Beth ""Neon"", who warned me about staying hydrated with electrolytes and hitting the wall....I'm/we're doing much better and can't thank you enough for sending us care packages at our next few stops!! Looking forward to them!! (Our mail drops are listed on our journal site).Well, the Iron Horse just went by......Yeppers, the Inn is directly next to the tracks. It is a historic lil town and this Inn used to be a boarding house in the way back. Pretty cool. Except for the train whistle....but all part of the package or get the full affect!!

We decided to hike to the first shelter, Spring Mountain Shelter and then decide to stay or press to next, depending on time, weather and mainly, body condition. We arrived at about 1 pm, Mustard was there having lunch. We signed the log book, stretched, ate and wrote Fiber a note that we hoped to see him at the Little Laurel Shelter. Along the way we saw/met John Miles from Oregon, and Rocket & Ace. They were at the shelter tonight also. We arrived at 6:30 pm.I fell again today. On a down hill, that had a well worn deep V and it was very wide and deep with leaf liter. I stepped on a good size hidden root and slipped because of the leaves. No injuries and no cause for alarm!! Hiking Poles really help prevent most falls, but no All falls!!Exciting Critter Report today.Big Cypress shewed, a little tiny grey snake off the trail. Then we saw a doe on our left just standing on the hillside, watching very intently us walk by.

Sometimes it was sticks down and easier to use hands, but not a bad hike, just slower pace. We met some trail maintainers having lunch on the bald ridge, it was narrow & rocky!

We were hungry enough and got half way at a good time, so we decided it was a good idea. We were greeted at the shelter by a park ranger or forest service ranger. Sadly we should have checked better and gotten his name. He was from the area of Sams Gap and even offered us a ride to town if we needed or wanted. We asked about trash cans at Sams Gap, they have been removed....locals took advantage. So....he offered to take our trash with him!! Amazing and wonderful!!

Hopefully he will read this and sign our Guest Book!! Today was a bad day....mentally and physically!! Bodies are struggling and in pain. Big Cypress said he spent couple hours talking himself into staying on the trail. This is something we all go through!! Sometimes daily!! It's not easy out here. The younger people and their long days and high miles make it seem easy. Night recovery comes easier to them we believe. We have each other as support to stick it out, plus we're so stubborn and came all this way already, how can we stop now!?! We are planning on cutting back on the 20 mile days...sticking with 12 to under 20, for few reasons....to enjoy the views, take more breaks, and not be in such a gotta go gotta go mentality, to be better to our bodies!!

We pit stopped at the first shelter we came to, Curley Maple Gap, after I thought I saw it well before it was actually there!! Guess I had a in the woods mirage!?!?

He had camp chairs to sit & visit. It was nice!! Climbed Unaka Mountain @ 5180'.It was gorgeous up there, it snowed on Sunday and the top is a dense spruce forest.

We met Recycle, a local section hiker. He camped near by us last night. We first came upon a sign indicating we were in Big Foot Sanctuary and also a sign we entering habitat for endangered Yellow Side Warbler. Guess which one was legit?!? LOL    Then Big Cypress....Saw something when we round the bend.....Big and Black....a bear or a dog?? Not sure, it had a collar, but still not sure, they do put collars on bears to track them. We wondered for several minutes....until we stopped for a drink of water, leaves rustling....We stop moving, waiting....a big black hound dog pops out. He was shocked to see us!! He just stood there and didn't move. It was funny!! Finally, he put nose to the ground and continued on. We saw another dog, brown one with his family. Several picture spots today. One spot was a garden bench, seemingly random, but placed facing a lovely view. We had Lots of waterfalls. We even took lunch break at one to celebrate hitting the Over 400 miles mark and soaked our feet. Big Cypress had a mini widow maker fall on his shoulder. Not a big branch, but a small twiggy branch that scared us, but didn't hurt!! We had a couple more mishaps. Fiber kept twisting his ankle. Big Cypress almost left his hat on a rock from a break. Fiber also dropped one of his poles, tricky to get but at least we weren't on a cliff ledge.

He had questions and likes to talk with hikers, as he'd like to thru hike some day.It was a very rough day for some reason. Not really sure why. We didn't eat poorly and we slept decent, so that wasn't the problem as it was in the past. There were a lot of up hills and this morning they were really steep. We usually say, ""they want us up this hill/mountain fast."" We stopped for lunch snack and break at about noon. This is our usual plan for each day, hike half our miles for the day by 11:30 to Noon, then continue on, to reach camp/shelter anywhere from 4 to 6-6:30.   We planned on hiking to the first shelter to sleep tonight, so lunch was a flat camping spot at a stream, which would be our half way miles of hiking today. SUNSHINE and TEARS!!! I struggled with the steep climbs this morning and they got to me. When we arrived at lunch I broke.

He told us that Steady and Teach were with Spirit of 76 at Relax Inn and not sure if they moved on to hike or still in Atkins.

We ran the ridge line most of the day, which means....no water source. We knew there was one after the Chestnut Shelter, but we Never saw it!! That meant about 7 miles, of no water to refill...only going with what we have left. We made it to about 3 miles away....When we got to the water source, a stream, we filled all our containers. I was SOOO thirsty, that I couldn't wait the 30 minutes to drink the treated water and just drank some.... we've heard of others not treating and just drinking from the source...so - I did.

We've been craving cold cereal, so....Fruity Pebbles it was. The younger hikers thought it was cool, that we were eating that for breakfast! Too funny! We had plenty, so Fiber had some too. Then we had fried eggs, since the cereal wouldn't last long in the tummies. After breakfast Big Cypress visited with Moonwatcher.Our hike today was hot, dry and filled with day hikers. We passed the Johns Spring shelter, as the water was unreliable. Hit the Catawba Mountain shelter, water was also unreliable, but it was flowing enough to fill our bottles. We then pressed on to McAfee Knob. It was about 2:30-3 pm, so people were heading back down the trail, so...less people to contend with for the picture spot. The knob is a big rock that jets out and has excellent views, a photo must for AT hikers. We got our pics and pressed on to Tinker Cliffs. I was nervous about the cliff, being afraid of heights. Well.....it wasn't as scary as the name, it was beautiful and our new favorite part of the trail. Don't get me wrong, it was a cliff and the trail did run very close to the edge, but....focus on the trail and not the edge....it's ok. Plus, watching your step is still necessary, rocks and roots a plenty, as not to trip.We arrived Lamberts Meadow Shelter at about 6:45 pm, completely pooped out. Fiber got a camp fire going for us this night. The shelter was full, we camped down by the stream. Crash, Rabbit and Leopard camped near us also, along with Lucky Duck (he hammocks).   Big Cypress is starting to get a chest cold, so he went to bed right after eating our dinner. Fiber hung his and our bear bags and then we sat around the fire and visited with Seam and Puzzles. Puzzles is a fellow Michigan girl, from Petosky. It was a nice evening and Big Cypress would chime in once and a while from our tent. Definitely a late night, we stayed up till almost 11 pm. Critters: 2 deer on the super steep hill above our stream & camp spot. They were just walking around, then one took off like a bullet and the other followed. Something must have scared them. Later, we know what spooked them....coyotes were close and howling and making all sorts of crazy sounds.","Four Pines Hostel

The shelter gang got an early start and were got out of camp about 8:30 am. The trail was extremely nice for a while and we made great time, about 2 1/2 miles per hour, maybe more. Then.....not!! Rocks, boulders and hills oh my. Not bad, just slows us down. Puzzles passed us this morning, shortly after .....WE SAW OUR FIRST BEAR!!   Fiber was in the lead, I in the middle and Big bringing up the end. We stop, Fiber points and whispers ""a bear"" at our 3 o'clock, down a hill about 200-250 yards. We initially just see a big black mass, which is not uncommon and not a bear. But....it's moving and looks at us....it is a bear!! We watch and it moves away from us, then.....two lil tiny cubs. They were so very small, they must have been newly born. We were thrilled to see them!!The weather has been amazing, hot, dry and sunny. Today was about 80°. We ran the ridge most of the late morning and then switch backs down the mountain opened to a flat nice side walk like trail. As we got closer to the road and Daleville/Troutville, the trail ran through newly bloomed trees and trees with flowers, blooming Dogwoods and wildflowers and it smelled amazing!! Big Cypress was struggling, we didn't take our normal breaks today, as we just wanted to get to town!! The heat and his congestion, sinuses and body aches were wearing on him. We finally had the trail open at highway 220. We turned right and headed to Howard Johnson Express. Big Cypress and Fiber rested outside and I asked Miss Missy if I could see a room. Room 103, close to the lobby, as we were exhausted. Done....We are staying. Fiber was going on to the Motel 6, he has his resupply box and meeting his Uncle there. I did Big Cypress laundry while he soaked in the bathtub. Then I walked over to the gas station next door and got drinks and snacks. Then I soaked and Big Cypress did my laundry. It's about 3:30 and we call the taxi, $15 to take us up to the Troutville Post Office. Then, we called Homer Witcher, A fellow thru hiker (2002) and trail maintainer. He wanted no money....and wouldn't take any!! We can't thank him enough!! The post office was very happy we picked up our boxes, we had a few boxes and we were taking up too much space, they said. We walked over to the Outdoor Trails outfitters. Got fuel and socks for Big. Then had a delicious meal, with real fabric napkins, at Three Lil Pigs BBQ. Boy was it good! They even give thru hikers a free banana pudding dessert!!! After dinner we stopped at Kroger for few things. Our room has lil fridge and microwave, so....lunch will be a big salad we got to go from the BBQ and dinner will be Bob Evans Mac n Cheese and Korean Beef Bulgogi. On our walk back we saw Rabbit, Leopard and Crash with Crash's dad. T B was shocked at Big Cypress weight loss, as he noticed right away. Later, TB took me up to CVS for KT Tape for muscles and blister prevention. Thanks Bunches!!Have to say....We miss Fiber!! He was toying with the idea of moving over here tomorrow, as the Ho Jo is basically right next to the trailhead.","Lamberts Meadow Shelter

We had hot pizza grits with Gold Fish crackers, snickers and mozzarella wrapped with salami (we packed out from a Kroger stop in Daleville).It's (usually) always hard to get back on the trail from a stop, for one reason or another.

Then the trail was very pleasant. We talked about pressing on to Harpers Ferry, if we made good time and could arrive before 5 pm, when the ATC (Appalachian Trail Conservancy) closes.

Big Cypress had 3 falls today, although he said only 2; since one his rear was close to a rock anyway and when he lost footing, he just ""sat down"". One spill was a fall into a good tree, causing elbow & forearm scrape! The other fall was on a slick rock, serious enough that it could have been hike ending!!

So...We visited with mom a little bit before she headed home and we just rested and watched some CBS Sunday Morning program. Around 10, the 4 of us headed to the closest REI store, only about 30 miles away. Big Cypress was having toe pain from the past 200 miles, in his Vasque Breeze. I also had some issues with my Keen Logan Low's. I was wearing the Merrell Ventilator and they did well for 800+ miles, just wore out in some places on the inside cushion. I decided to try Keen, for the wider toe box. They feel more like a firm boot and my ball of my feet really hurt more in the Keen, due to less cushioning.

Arrived at the Scott Farm Trail ATC Crew HQ for lunch. Joined by North Star, who we met in the Shenandoah's, A & E, Patchy and Unknown. Arrived at a nice spot by stream, instead of the Cove Mountain Shelter. There was a section hiker from FL already set up and then Slug, a fellow NOBO from FL also. Had nice chats with both.We saw our very first wild strawberry fruit, tiny but red. We are seeing TONS of wild berry blossoms and they smell wonderful.

Lunch at the Doyle in Duncannon PA. (Fiber advised us not to sleep there, we weren't anyway) We must say the food was great! I had a cheese burger n fries, Big Cypress had homemade Spaghetti and meatballs!! We had a tough day with the tent worms and inch worms repelling from their threads and getting on us ALL day!! Eewww yucky!! An all out invasion!! We had to pick them off each other. The trail is now living up to the hype....Pennsylvania Rocks or Rocksylvania. Boulders and smallish toe, foot and ankle hurtful ones. We tented next to Shao and Oh So. Big Cypress took the massive job of getting water (as he always does). Today though at this shelter it's down 300 boulder steps! Not pleasant by any means!! Also....nobody slept in the shelter as it's covered in black soot.

Didn't turn into the shelter as it was .3 off trail, tented across the AT at the big stream. Delightful!! Rained on us around midnight, but didn't last all night!!Critters: loads of chipmunks, tons of birds, 3 pm a rattle snake, 4 pm two Black snakes happily entwined! We pretended we didn't see them doing it and continued on. Watched a big black wood ant drag the queen, I think it was the queen, by her mandible and sometimes wing. Not sure where it was taking her, but worked very hard at it. The ""queen"" only moved her antenna. Pretty wild! Ok....I know I didn't give details about rattle snake. So......there we were....cruising along. Come to a note that says. ""saw rattle snake 5/26/16 @ 1 pm"" (Shao saw/wrote it). So, we were extra vigilant!! Not enough though. I saw out of the corner of my left eye a coiled snake. I was only about a foot away from it when I saw it. It was relaxed, with head resting on its body, but coiled, not relaxed in MY mind, but ready to GET me!!!! I stop dead in my tracks, start going backwards FAST, Big Cypress has no idea what's going on. Finally he realized, snake! I said if I could have jumped into his arms, I would've!! So, no rattle, no movement, nothing from the rattle snake chillin' in the sun.

I didn't even ask, he just offered!! Water was an issue today. We missed a source and came upon another just when we realized we HAVE to get it, because no water for almost 10 miles. Plus, it's hot!!

So...maybe not as humid.Rocks were more plentiful today, but not as bad as we keep expecting!! We did learn from a couple of locals, that the Hiking Club deliberately moved the trail for more rockyness to have less trail maintenance needed. Amazing and believable, since you can see where the trail used to be and where we walk now.....in the rocks. (rocks = less erosion).Arrived at 5, Shao, Rocket Cat were already there. Unknown caught us about 2 miles out from the shelter and hiked in with us. We decided to tent closer to the AT, closer to the water and very nice tent spots. Mustard Seed, we saw again this morning, after not seeing since before the Roller Coaster, and he's here too! The calzone was delicious today, we ate it at lunch and again later as a lil snack, one piece each left for snacking. Oh yeah, we got trail magic at the 183 road crossing....ice cold soda in a cooler and a cooler with ice cold water to fill our water bottles. Thank you so very much to the families that provided that for hot thirsty hikers!! Critters: Lots of baby toads and big ones too. So many chipmunks and some aren't afraid to get close to you.

We hit the trail this morning at 7:40 am. It was pretty rocky, as we expected! (small pointed ones, hidden under leaves or just hard to avoid at all and big boulders, those move under your feet and Big Cypress almost fell hard) Not happy about it, but not a surprise. We leapfrogged the morning with Mustard Seed, Shao, Rocky Cat (not Rocket as I thought), Burning Leaf and Unknown. After a EXTREMELY Steep trail going down into Port Clinton we popped out of the woods at a bit after 11. Headed for Hwy 61 toward Hamburg, as we have reservations at Microtel. Stuck our thumbs out. Oops, first vehicle way far away looks like it is a police suv. So....no thumbs!! Just walking. We aren't sure of the laws about hitching in PA. So....yes, it was a State Trooper. We walk and wait, then thumbs out again.....nothing! Then, we see the trooper turning around. I say, ""well we are about to get a ride or a ticket"". Trooper Hillbish pulled over and asked Big Cypress, where are you going? He said Hamburg. Where in Hamburg? Big replied, the Microtel. He said would you like a ride? Thank you Jesus, Yes!! The hotel was less than 2 miles away, but 61 is a 4 lane divided highway and very busy! Plus, it's sunny and hot/humid. So.....there we were getting a ride!! My first time in a police car!! Interesting!! Trooper Hillbish didn't even lecture us. (we Googled the law and yes, it's illegal) We learned that our Trail Angel Hillbish is an 5 year active duty Army veteran and in the National Guard now. We pulled up to the hotel and I tried to get out.....daaa.... My Polish-ness was showing, can't let myself out, I'm in a police car LOL!! We thanked him profusely and checked in at noon. Got a picture from Unknown, Shao, Rocky Cat and Burning Leaf. They are staying at the Port Clinton Hotel and aren't very happy about it!! But, holiday weekend, choices are limited!! We booked a week ahead for fear of not getting a room. The usual chores...laundry, soaking in tub, cleaning and gear maintenance. Then we walked to Cracker Barrel for Linner (lunch/dinner). Then across the highway to Cabela's and Wal-Mart. We saw the 4 guys while we were walking. The got a ride from a gentleman, while walking, not even trying to get a ride. We ended up getting a few things at both places and then the guys went to Pappy T's restaurant/pub in our hotel and asked us to join them. So we did!! I talked to our son Shawn for about a hour, while I soaked my feet. He asked for a dinner with his brothers for his birthday, so he wanted to tell us and we wanted to hear all about it!! Can't believe Shawn is 20!! Wowwie!! Big worked on figuring out where our resupply boxes are!!! We called Port Clinton post office to get boxes sent to the hotel, since Monday is holiday, so we didn't have to wait until Tuesday for PO to open!! Well.....now the boxes are Not here and MIA. We think we might get food at Wal-Mart and have Microtel do a return to sender. So....???? Crazy!! Well, God has His hands all over us. We really were supposed to be out for 7 sleeps. I sent family that we were out for 6. We pushed miles a couple days, to get into town on Sunday, only because the trail was ok enough to do longer miles, which made it 6 sleeps and God made it happen!! Plus, there's a yucky Tropical Storm/Depression lurking about to bring bad weather and.....We are safe and indoors now!! Critters: Black Racer Snake with an attitude!

Hit the breakfast at the hotel lobby. Rested and soaked in Epsom salts a few times. Read some of Rabbit's (Rob from Connecticut) trail journal. Wondering how the next 76 miles of trail looked, how long his days were and so on. Found very helpful information, thank you Rabbit. Hard to believe we had dinner together back in Hiawasee and now he's 2 weeks ahead of us. We sent texts to fellow hikers.

They came to the hotel, with Steady's folks. They are off the trail for a few days, because they are close to home and can chill a bit for free. We finally met Spirit of 76 and saw The Roman Noodles. We haven't seen them since signing in at Springer Mountain GA on Feb 13. Nice to sit outside and visit at the picnic table here at hotel. We also have Stealth, from Indiana here also. Haven't seen him since right before Harpers Ferry.Steady & his dad ran us up to Walmart. We got our foods for 4 sleeps out & Caesar Salads for dinner tonight.

Oh yes....I have been meaning to tell you, that local couple we met couple days ago, is Richard & Heather. Richard is Ecologist & Biologist. They talked with us about the trail, maintenance of it, bugs, plants and trees. Even pointing out the American Chestnut tree. Longish oblong leaf with bread knife like ""serrated"" edges.

Now our earliest start!! Today was our longest day in terms of miles. We skipped a hot lunch, snacked all day. Trail was tricky....and slow!! It's not just a walk in the woods, it's rock climbing too and that was one of those days!! Big Cypress was a great cheerleader and help, as I struggled with the no poles kind of climbing....actually climbing rocks!! Finding little niches for fingers and toes. Even a rebar ladder we had to climb, in the side of a flat faced boulder....but.....We made it safely!! That wasn't as bad as the crack I clung to while laying on my right side and scooting while trying not to slide down it, to a spot on the right side of this boulder that I could actually then climb down. Big took a different way that was more difficult....steeper with a couple big drops to get down. Glad we never have to climb those buggers ever again, although others lie ahead. We entered NY today. We met Hail again, he was at the church hostel. Unknown popped out of the woods right where we saw a Copperhead snake....We warned him to avoid getting bit!! Just in the knick of time. Nice to see him again and sporting his new Osprey pack, like Big switched to. AK also leapfrogged us....not sure the last time we saw him. He saw another copperhead and stayed near the spot till we arrived to warn us. Tough, long day of rocks and boulders. But....not anything like Pennsylvania rocks....those are sharp and or pointy! These here are more like rounded ones and boulders the size of houses and cars.Matt from Anton's on the Lake hotel was getting other hikers, so suggested we get ice cream at the Bellville Creamery. He picked us up at 7:15. We stopped at CVS for snacks n stuff for trail. Had Italian delivery....delicious and tons of food, enough for tomorrow.","Pochuck Mountain Shelter

Laundry is included in our stay and he is willing to shuttle you for free to town, which is really only half mile away or less, depending on the business you want to visit. We rested, after Big walked to the post office and Subway for lunch. I soaked my toe and we soaked bodies in Epsom salts a few times today.We called our boys, our folks and I spoke to both my sisters and my Aunt Sally. Text some of our trail family, like Suds & Subman, Fiber, and the Near Miss (Rabbit, Leopard & Crash). Everyone is doing well. Fiber is about 40 miles ahead and Suds/Sub are 76 miles behind.

We have to say that Matt is a great business owner and very accommodating!! We were back on the trail @ 7:30 with big muffins and OJ compliments of Matt!! I wasn't feeling well this morning, I believe the antibiotics for my toe was to blame. The threat of severe thunderstorms probably didn't help my uneasyness either!!We hit the Eastern Pinnacles pretty quick....they were a challenge for Moonbeam, but again....I survived! Big Cypress rock hops like a mountain goat....I'm more like a scaredy cat!! Having trouble finding my inner goat!!We met Clementine from OH and Quicksand from FL. We were blessed by trail magic from a special trail angel Paddy-O, Mr Patrick O. Lynch. He was on the trail going south and hiked back north to give us great stories, and.....Gatorade and Honeybuns. He told us about the endangered Cricket frog and we actually heard it later, while hiking. Paddy-O said they sound like hiking poles hitting together. We got squeezed, big time by the Lemon Squeezer at mile 1385.6 It really was a tiny sliver to get thru two eminence boulders. Ok....so it never rained, or even looked like it was going to!! Praise the Lord!! Not good for water sources that thirsty hikers need to survive though. With that being said we got water at Surebridge Brook and hiked with all containers filled, 10 liters in all, up a 350 foot climb to the shelter that has an unreliable water source.

Dry....and a serious problem for hikers!!Critters: squirrels, chipmunks, crows, doves, blue jays, robins, cardinals, birds I can't identify by their call, but wish I could!! 4 point buck in velvet that was very photogenic.

Then we hiked around Hessian Lake, BBQ's and lots of people enjoying the sunny breezy day. We stopped for a soda and couple hotdogs from a vendor.

I want to finish, but I don't want to hike anymore! It's a difficult mix, not wanting to be a person that quits but on the same hand not wanting to hike anymore! Well....We still continue to tell people we meet along the way that they can follow our journey at this website. Today we met two ladies from Massachusetts, we talked for a few minutes. They said we must go to Upper Goose Pond, it's beautiful! We asked about water availability at the shelter, since it's listed as unreliable. They said it's there, just not a strong flow. We sat for a break & took several pictures at Nuclear Lake. The moon was out & flowers blooming....very pretty!!We tented on a flat-ish spot. Sparks arrived and sheltered with a section hiker, Chardonnay tented right next to us. BaBa was going to press on, but decided to stay instead. He found a flat spot on a high spot above the shelter. Our spot was down wind from the privy, only a slight breeze off & on, so...not too stinky. There was also a couple in hammocks, they looked like hikers out for a few days. Tinkerbell said she really was wanting a egg sandwich and the trail provides, really God provides! Just like we heard about the hiker that had something in his eye & couldn't get it out. At camp that night was an eye Dr. that had things necessary to remove the item from his eye and treat it.

Two Peas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/540740,"Congdon Shelter to Goddard Shelter   - God had other plans for us !!We woke with the songs of the birds. (God's alarm clock) We weren't in a big hurry to get going this morning, laid there until about 5:30-5:45. It's a butterfly morning, warm & sunny. Breakfast was our eggs, tomatoes & mushrooms with cheese. We ate the eggs, but prefer the oatmeal! We both are very sore this morning. Feet and legs. Moonbeam has been caring for a sore IT band. Massage & Icy Hot rub. We hit the trail a bit before 7 am. Crossing over Stage Coach Rd and then .2 north of the road Moonbeam slipped on a tree root and fell to the right. The area was flattish, but Vermont is notorious for mud and we did trudge thru mud prior to the fall. So....the fall! I heard a crack mid fall and started screaming....and my leg was bent under me and my left leg. Big Cypress started to calm me down by telling me I may not have broke a bone, it could have been a muscle or tendon. We gingerly moved the R leg out from under the left. The pain was excruciating, but subsided quickly. I never broke a bone before, but saw one and bones were broken through the skin and that's NOT what I had. So....I believed Big that it may not be broken and since the pain let up....We laid there a lil bit. Babbit came upon us, asked if we needed help and we assured him we were ok and he moved on. After about a hour, we decided to see if I could move. Nope!! Not without screaming bloody murder!! So.....now it's time for professional help. Big called 911 after getting our GPS coordinates. The emergency crew had a hard time finding us, only until two men, Jeremiah & Shawn, out for a ATV ride, and knows the area helped the crew find us. Big also went to the road .2 miles south and put a big stick and stick arrows on the ground. We put my rain jacket under me and Big Cypress pulled his down bag out and covered me. I started shivering and Big was scared I was going into shock. I also took a couple sips of water and ate 2 Snickers bars, while we waited.Jeremiah & Shawn, the local guys arrived first. At 11:19 am, Phillip, Kyle & Glen arrived right behind them. The helicopter flew over us a few times. I said ""that better not be for us"", thinking, it's not broken and a helicopter & crew are coming and all I have is a sprain or something!! Phillip & Kyle said that my femur was fractured! I asked how they knew that?!? Since Big had said it wasn't and again, bones weren't sticking out. They said ""it's obviously deformed"". From my position, my thigh just looked swollen. So....come to find out, Big knew it was most likely broken, but was trying to keep me calm and avoiding going into shock. Well, pain meds were given to me. Then the painful pulling & traction rod placed on my leg! The, as my sister called them, knights in shining armor carried me down the wet, muddy, root & rock trail. Through a small stream too! For what seemed forever. I was put into an ambulance for a 5-10 drive to the helicopter. Where Dwayne & Scott & the pilot with the big mustache took me to Albany Medical Center in Albany NY, after a 12 minute flight. I was lying down, so couldn't see a thing. I'm still thanking God for holding back the rain. It started to rain just as I was being put into the helicopter. Big was taken to the fire station, where he was offered, food, shower, bed to sleep if needed. Then, they asked him if he wanted to sit & wait until they could get him to the hospital or if he wanted to run errands/calls. He went with the later. The fire chief ended up bringing Big to the hospital and arriving just about 10-15 minutes before my surgery. The Dr said he was going to make 2 or 3 small incisions ( knee & hip ) and put a steel rod into my femur. Yes...Inside of it!! So after 2 sleeps in the hospital, I was released and on a plane homeward bound on Wednesday night. Thank you so very much to: the Bennington Rural Fire Department, Bennington Rescue Squad, Glenn, Phillip, Kyle, Jeremiah, & Shawn, the Helicopter crew, Dwayne, Scott, and the pilot (we didn't catch his name) and everyone that assisted and/or was on the scene and helped us!! Thank you to everyone at Albany Medical Center, Dr. Czajka, my surgeon, Nurse Will and all the ER staff that cared for me.

Back pack - from ULA Circuit to Osprey Atmos 65 (reason - ULA held up, but was uncomfortable with the weight of our food. As Big carried all our food for 7 days)2. Sleeping Pad - REI AirRail 1.5 to Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite Mattress (reason - lighter weight & the valve on AirRail was sticking and wouldn't stay closed when rolled)3. Ursack Bear Bags to a SeaSummit Dry Sack for Food (reason - Ursak too heavy and not waterproof) although we did have something chew a hole in the SeaSummit in June, that wouldn't have happened with Ursak.4. Osprey Pack Cover5. Sea to Summit Aeros Ultralight Pillow 6. Footwear - Oboz Saw Tooth to Vasquez to Solomon Quest 4D II (reason - wore out Oboz, did cause blisters. Happiest with Solomon's)7. Petzel E+lite Headlamps (not advised for night hiking, but we didn't hike in dark, so the brightness was great for packing in the morning predawn)8. Silk sleeping bag liner held up for most part. Some holes, but didn't affect function.9. Columbia pants - both pair held up, with some minor trail mending.10. IceBreaker camo short sleeve kept/sent long sleeve home when warmer weather hit/replaced with Ultra lightweight wool IceBreaker Tshirt.11.

We did have to buy a new bag for the main tent, as the one that came with it ripped beyond repair. Pole & stake bags still ok.15. Orthotics - sent Happy Feet home.

Vargo Alcohol stove system w/Denatured fuel to Snow Peak LiteMax w/canister fuel (reason - took to long to heat water for 2 people, especially in cold temps) Canister fuel easy to get and lighter weight.

Healing is going great, we have a follow up appointment with the orthopedic surgeon on Monday, after that we are hitting the road, destination Vermont AT NOBO mile 1607. We've been preparing for this for several weeks, we just didn't journal about it until we were SURE we were going!! 
Big Cypress needs/wants to complete his hike and will be accompanied by our youngest son, Shawn, (Trail name is yet TBD). I will be involved in the completion as much as I can. I will be providing trail support for the 582 miles. My still healing femur won't be in hiking condition for a year and ideally 2 years. So...knowing this and not sure I really want to finish, we have decided to press on Now!! 
We hope you will follow our journey again and resume prayers....Thank you to those who have reached out to us since my fall and all thoughts & prayers, since June 27, they have very much appreciated!!

So, just a freak accident, nothing to do with my physical condition or health!! We got the ok to travel, so....off to VT, NH & Maine!!

Big Cypress & Shawn we walking off into the woods at just about 11 am. I was a little emotional...worried about their safety! Wondering if God really wanted us back on the trail?!? (Well, not Moonbeam....as I'm not able!) Big Cypress assured me, He (God)would've stopped us before now. Thoughts are racing in my mind. Maybe I, Moonbeam, needed off trail so that Father & Son can hike, bond, make memories, grow and mature! His Devine plan!! He's in control!! He will guide their feet, make them swift and keep them safe!! For whatever His reason is. Well...Oliver, our Jack Russel Terrier, and I took a spin thru Bennington. My Knights in Shining Armour are volunteers & not at the Rescue Station. So, I was unable to go see them and thank them once again! We spent a few hours at Stewart's Shop (convenience store/gas station). Sat outside, had our lunch, brought from home and visited with a couple older gents. Funny thing, when mentioned I fell in June here in VT they new about me...David aka Bear has a radio that gets the rescue or police calls & knew all about my injury. I didn't get the older gents name, he was very nice & Oliver really took to him. He headed home and then Ed sat down to visit. I found out we didn't get Big Cypress & Shawn to the closest spot or the same spot that is. David informed me and Big confirmed by sending me a text stating they didn't hike as far today, as they had to hike 3 or 4 miles to the AT spot where I fell. So, they were a little off plan, but doing well. I told our parents we were here & safe! I chatted with my mom a bit, but service isn't very good, so dropped the call.I headed out to the road crossing I'm meeting them at tomorrow. I arrived at 3:30, Kelley Stand Rd & Statton Arlington Rd. Nice gravel road. It was about 10 miles give or take, to the Parking area. Journey & Ducky were getting water when u arrived. They moved on going south. Then I was quickly greeted by Bumblebee from Maine. She's a AT class of 2011 alum and attempting a SOBO this time. We visited for hours! We also were joined, only briefly by, Chipolte from Arkansas, Twinkle from Denver and a couple other hikers, names slipped my mind. I welcomed them to leave trash with me & to help themselves to some filtered water! We came with a 7 Gallon container.Bumblebee tented near by at a nice camp site she passed coming south. Oliver and I packed ourselves in the cozy accommodations of the back of the Tundra and eavesdropped on some very young & loud SOBO thru hikers. It's 8:04 pm. Praying all is well with my men this first night out!

Big Cypress & Shawn arrived at about 4. I was sharing some soda with Casper a FlipFlopper & Terry SOBO thru. I wasn't planning trail magic for more than my guys, so after Casper & Terry left I commenced to cooking!! They had stayed to chat only a bit and decided it was time to press on. Big & Shawn were super excited about dinner. They made 9 burgers disappear in no time. I had one. (Not hiking, so needing to be vigilant on my consumption of calories). After our meal, foot soaks were had, yes we brought our footbath and epsom salts for weary feet. We have often ""car/truck"" camped in the past, so Big decked out our Tundra with an inverter hooked directly to battery, so we can make coffee, charge cell phones and plug in the footbath sent from heaven!!

We navigated our way around the farmers market road closure to park right out front of the Yellow Deli. Andrew and many hikers greeted us. We got our shower & laundry tour, I got Oliver situated on the back deck area and he was soon being loved up by hikers, many who miss their own pupies! Jane, from Ohio, with a love for Michigan (even had a necklace charm of the mitten & lakes, pretty sweet) helped me get our clothes washing, she was more than happy to let us wash or items with hers, as she was just about to start it. We walked to Gill's Deli. Not our intended eating spot, we were going to pizza place, but the line was SO long at the deli, we had to go here. All those people must know something! Yep!! Delicious!! Big & I shared a Giant size grinder of 100% Maine Crab meat. Shawn had hot & boiled ham grinder. We walked back toward the YD, SJ went to be with Oliver, we stopped at Walmart for couple things. One being 2 rolls of KT Tape for blisters & foot issues. Its not in pharmacy, but sporting goods area, who knew all this time. Paying 5 bucks more per roll at CVS. WoW!! At Yellow Deli we chatted a bit, had a couple slices of watermelon, while our clothes finished drying and then head out to trail head, where I met them this morning and we had a campfire, got water and went to sleep early, as tomorrow is planned for big miles day, so early start.Critter Report Robert had close encounter with a black bear. So, close he said it's coat was black as coal and very shiny!

We woke this morning at 5:10 got up and started pancakes as requested!! My guys were into the woods and the ""green tunnel"" by 630am.Oliver and I went into Rutland to Walmart again, for a second camp chair for us and a Elk Antler for Oliver to chew. He's pretending to be a porcupine or other woodland Critter that naws on them. I then used the Irving gas station WiFi after we gased up and iced up our cooler. I mainly did trip planning, for me to park & meet them on the trail that lay ahead. Did some banking, got water and some family communication. Even texted Sooner or Later to let him know we weren't in position to attend church with him this morning at his church in Randolph VT, He's pastor at. We were 40 miles one way from here.Unfortunately spent so much time with trail plans I forgot to journal. Since time was getting late, 230pm, I head out to Hwy 4, arrived about 3:30, my hikers arriving at about 6pm. The parking area is very busy and I got lots of looks, as my camp spread look as though I'm homeless. We finally ate our dehydrated trail meals tonight. It was hard not to surprise them with pizza tonight. Shawn ate 2 meals of chicken, stuffing and gravy. Big Cypress had pesto tortellini and I had veg, chicken ramen. They had 2 good climbs today, of 2500 feet, one was first thing this morning and the second Killington. AWOL doesn't say it, but the sign on the Mtn does. Killington had a good boulder scramble for Shawn to ""practice"" on. As many many more are up ahead. They were tired but in good spirits. Shawn had a toe nail cut into its neighbor toe, little bloody but cleaned it up and will wrap with KTape in the morning. Big soaked his feet in Epsom salt till pack prep time before going to bed. We were in bed by 7:20pm. Critter Report:Big Cypress treed a porcupine, not on purpose, but the lil guy got scared, quills went up and he hurried up the tree. Big stayed to video it and watched as it made its way down the tree. Porcupines climb down exactly the same path they went up and do it going butt first. Yes, they climb down backwards or in reverse. I learned that years ago in Michigan at a porcupine sanctuary. Pretty funny & cute to watch!","VT 140 Road Crossing

Happy Labor Day! 
US 4 to VT12/Barnard Rd for 23.7 miles
I've been thinking about a trail name for Shawn. I really think Animal is appropriate!! He's keeping up with his dad and doing big miles. I believe today will make 3 or 4 Twenty Plus days. My cousin Nancy said that the Tour D'France guys were Animals, when we drove through the super high mountains and part of the race area. So...that's what made me think of this name for Shawn. No longer being passed by over weight grandma's, but coming into his own & doing it!! Becoming a hiker! Still struggling to breath on the ups, but doing great!
Yesterday they ran into a hiker that personally knows one of our TJ readers and he writes his own blog, Rowdy! She even wanted a picture of Big & Animal, as she read about our accident & falling on his blog and was excited to tell Rowdy she met us, or at least one of the Peas!!
Today they will summit Quimby Mountain at 2515 feet. 
Hopefully they make good time today so they can get ice cream at On The Edge Farm. They close at 5:30pm. Good motivation to hike at good pace. The farm is .2 west off the trail and Animal said ""just get the ice cream for us, I don't care if it's melted!"" 
I arrived at the meeting spot at about 11. Passed the parking spot & ended up at The Edge Farm store. I bought a pack of bacon for morning, homemade garlic/parm sausage and an apple crisp pie. Back to the parking spot....no space left!! Back to the store! She suggested hiker friendly, Daniel's barn/hostel adjacent the trail head & filled parking spot. White pickup in drive, score, he's home! Love to have us, suggested I leave Big a note to come here, even though its almost within sight. The barn is but not ours truck. Daniel said its by donation, there's an outside shower & we can put a tent up in the barn!... Nice! Oliver & I walked to leave a note, it's less than .1 of mile. Oliver, I mean Pumpkin, and I met Foxy a NOBO when we were leaving the note for Big. He went straight to the store for ice cream. We also met Scooch a FF from NH, she's hiking with broken arm, she got while hiking AT. She bunked at Daniel's barn last night. He must have had a lot of hikers, because he mowed a big patch of tall grass down, next to the barn! Flat & tent perfect! 
Oliver met cows for the first time! He was very apprehensive, but the girls were very inquisitive & he settled a lil bit...but stil not thrilled! Did i also mention that Oliver didn't want to walk up the stairs at Yellow Deli. He is a FL flatlander & it was a full flight up & I don't think he ever encountered a stairwell.
I keep forgetting to mention how extremely blessed we've been with beautiful weather! God is certainly smiling upon us with sun and puffy white clouds speckled here & there!
I've been thinking about Shawn's trail name....maybe even Beast, instead of Animal. I'll run it by him tonight. Big Cypress thinks it should be 580, since hes hiking 582 miles.
They arrived at 530pm. Well Big did and shawn was half hour behind.
We visited with Crash Pad & his wife (forgot name), they are hiking with Ontario & a big group.

Olivers trail name wish bone! On our first day out, a couple of hikers called him Wish Bone. A PBS show for kids a few years back. So...I couldn't remember what they called him. Didn't write it down. Then yesterday Ontario & few other hikers called him Wish Bone! Done!! 
So...we slept well at Daniel's barn last night! Shawn slept in the loft of the barn. Ontario's group with TuneUp both military vets are hiking in a group like 30 plus strong. They all crashed at the barn. Some even slept in the flatbed trailer parked next to our truck! I took a picture!!
Bacon & Eggs with Tortillas in loo of toast. And my guys were off at 625am. Daniel came out to visit. Everyone started to rise and visiting commenced! I met TuneUp...he's excited to meet Big Cypress. He's a Marine that got out, then wanted in, so since he has a family went back in, but into the Coast Guard.
I helped Crash Pad & his wife slack pack. Also, gave Caveman, Pyro and TuneUp rides into Hanover. Dropped them off at the post office, in the heart of Dartmouth College. Went and got our room at Sunset Motor Inn. Then Pyro called me. Needed a ride to hotel. So....when I got back to the post office, they all piled back in & I dropped Caveman & TuneUp at the ball field for the college. They allow parking & stealth tenting (in woods near by). Pyro had reserved room about 4 miles past our sleep spot. I dropped him. Realized I missed a call from Big, by 30 minutes. 
I called Big back, he said Animal hurt his knee & needed to get off it, elevated & ice! I went to near where Big said he was & Animal was 15 minutes behind. No sign of them. So i went to Podunk Rd. Nope, not there. So...I drove the road walk they had to do, as the AT walks thru towns today. There's my Big Cypress. I stop, he refills his water and a van pulls up. It's Miss Bobbi!! She's been reading our journals & we've been in touch via email along our early AT journey. It was so nice to meet her. Big hiked on, Miss Bobbi & I went to where Animal would come out of the woods. Just as I get turned around, there he is. Animal sat on the tailgate & we chatted with Miss Bobbi, aka The Hat Lady. She said she shuttled Subman & Suds to the Sunset Motor Inn, where we r staying tonight. Miss Bobbi also helped us get in touch with Sooner or Later. He's coming here to see us in the morning!! 
So, showers, clean clothes, pizza from Ramunto's, in bellies, all before 6:55 pm. The Sunset Motor Inn, nice and reasonably priced for college town where tuition is 50k plus. 
Shawn's trail name...Animal it is! Plus, as Animal from Muppets...its also appropriate!!
He's planning on more hiking with his friends in the future. He likes it!! He said!!","VT 12 / Barnard Gulf Rd

I heard about her, as she is hiking with a broken rib. She was one of the three of us, of broken bone discussion at Daniel's Red Barn, along with me and Scooch with broken arm.My hikers were on the trail by 6:05 am. The normally busy Post Office area of Main St & Lebanon St., was still sleeing! It was a calm beginning to the day. Cool & Cloudy at 64°. WishBone & I stopped to gas up & clean the back window, then head back to the motel. We rested until a little after 8, when the included breakfast was ready. After breakfast, we finished packing up, got a shower, and called my folks to tell them all is well. In case no cell service at next road crossing/meeting spot. We head out about 10:30 am. Arrived at 11:30 & no phone service. Todays hike consists of Moose Mountain, highest peak of 2293 feet. Also, Holts Ledge, described in AWOL as precipitous drop-off, with views.So, Bill Ackerly used to open his home & yard to hikers. He also had ice cream...a hiker treat! Unfortunately, Bill passed away in May & the family rented out the property and it's no longer open to hikers, confirmed by a sign posted at the end of the driveway. So, on this word TURNPIKE. Grafton Turnpike is not what we all invision. Its a sleepy lil road, yes paved, maybe a ""turnpike"" in the 17 or 18 hundreds, but not what we all see in our minds eye in 2016. It's a little 2 lane country road & Dorchester is dirt. There is a very large parking area and very near the Dartmouth Ski lift area, guess its overflow parking area, perfect for hiker drop & pick up.They met me very early, a few minutes before 2 pm. So, they had a sandwich, as we visited with Crash Pad & wife, 2Pak. Then we moved on the additional 2 miles. Arriving at about 3, with Sasquat 2 minutes ahead of them. He moved on up the trail.Critter Report: WishBone & I took the smaller roads to the Grafton spot.

Got nice shady spot #13, qent to the pool for swim & then to Jane's for dinner. My Hikers had AYCE Fish & I had Patty Melt. After a hassle with my phone & calling Sprint yesterday, getting NO where! Using WiFi at Jane's and searching the Internet, it seems our new Samsung Galaxy S7 phones have an issue connecting to Data while Roaming. My phone doesn't even show it as an option, like Big's. Nobody is sure how to fix it, so....we are out of luck. Frustrating!! It is a problem with Samsung phones I guess, somebody even got rid of S5 for S7 & found it to have same problem!! So, after dinner we went to Moose Scoops for ice cream and back to camp, feet soaking for Big Cypress and bed!! PS water or lack of it has been an issue on many sections of trail near here. Hiker, ""digging"" thru mud for water was even seen! I'm loaded down with it, so I can give it out if needed!!Something I learned today while listening to an audio book. A secret to a successful marriage, not having a Plan B. It distracts from Plan A, which all commitment should be focused.

The trail surprised Big today. Harder than he anticipated and came upon a rock wall that required hand over hand climbing of roots & smaller rocks on the ""side"" of the rock face.

I sat at the visitor center until about 1:30, when the phone rang, adjacent to my sitting spot.

So....they didn't know I was on my way! Then the ""pleasant"" gift shop lady, relayed my message that I was there & couldn't walk to that building they were in. The man that relayed the message to Big said nothing about me/wife, not anything about them calling for help or ride. Just that the gift shop lady needs Big Cypress in the gift shop.

Directly to White Mountains Hostel. Where we see Fiber and drop Shawn off! We then go to the Royalty Inn, dog friendly, clean and recommended!! All is well!! Thank you Jesus for protecting Big & Animal and giving Big good judgment to not continue on hiking that mountain range! While at the summit the man that spoke to Big said....""see that list of names on the wall, they all thought they would be ok too!"" ""If you leave, you do want your name to be on that list."" Thank you God, for relaying that message to my husband. He and Animal did go out to start hiking....yes.....he admitted thinking ""we will be fine"", then immediately turned around!!

Two Peas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548847,"Start Mt Washington Summit @ mile 1856.2 and a much improved & SUNNY day!! to Pinkham Notch Visitor Center mile 1869.7 for 13.5 miles.
We arrived at the Mt Washington Auto Road shuttle area building at 8:15 am. Looked around the gift shop, used to potty, paid the 26 pp (military rate)for one way shuttle back to the top! The weather at 9 am, was temp of 41° with windchill at 34°. Winds at 10 mph. Like a night & day difference from last summit, 2 days ago.
Turtle was at the visitor center when I arrived at 10. We visited for few hours. I sat at a table and chatted with 3 thru hikers, Highfive from New Orleans,
Johnny B from Lebanon TN, and Two Soles from Hattiesburg MS. Sharon & Robert Greenfield Park Quebec talked with Oliver and I for over an hour. Then about 5pm, I met Ladybug from LA & Phoenix, he saw Big & Animal not long ago and then Carrot from Wisconsin, confirmed the same. They both leapfrogged them. 
So...at 5:50 I see my husbands smiling face!! Yippy...hurray!! Animal is bringing up the rear. They would have been in sooner, but Big fell a few times. One being very precarious....lower half of his body hanging off a twenty foot drop off. He is a little banged up, but not too bad. Hurt his wrist pretty good, but not broken. Plus, Big said they would have been sooner not only did they both fall today, they got off on the wrong trail for about half n hour!! Oops!!
The hike today was ok they said. Mt Washington was a little cloudy. The ride up was clear blue skies. Big said the driver pulled 6 inches from the cliff edge to show them the glacial lake. Big said ""it went straight down"" & was creepy!! He said, ""you would have crapped my pants!"" It was very sketchy, as there was no ""side of the road, it just was the road & then right down!"" I'm so glad we opted for the shuttle up for them!! Big took some video up top, but not a lot for the day. He spoke about the shuttle trip a lot and falling. We are all so happy that the big looming W is done!!
We went 3.1 miles to a car pull off spot near the Mt Wash. auto road, Animal stealth camped & we slept in the back of the truck. In our sleeping position by 7:15pm. Our dinner was various sandwich meats, fruit and PB Brownie. Animal had fruit, a trail meal of ramen, chicken & saurkraut and a brownie.","Mt Washington Summit

The leaves have kicked it up a notch and the reds are really starting to change more. We are pretty excited!!The original plan for today was to AMC's Imp Campsite .2 off the trail & 10 dollars per person. Animal asked to slack instead of full gear and shorter miles. So...he said he'd much rather go more miles with less to carry. This also is a very popular spot to slack pack, so...its doable & not out of the ordinary. Hike highlights: the notch start at 2050' elevation then 3 mile climb to Wildcat Mountain peak E at 4066'. Then peak C at 4278', then peak A 4422' and an additional 2 miles from peak E to C. Later its Carter Dome at 4832' the highest point of the day, then Mt Hight at 4653'. Then bouncing ups & downs and then down down down to 780' for road crossing & sleep. Saw Carrot at about 4 pm, she was on her way to White Mtn Hostel. Visited with Chupacabra from San Diego and Wildfire from Knoxville TN.My hikers arrived @ 7pm. Animal came in yelling, ""I beat the old man, I beat the old mam."" Big was close behind. Food was hot and ready. I had a slight heads up from other hikers & figured they'd be starving! Big had tortellini with left over rotisserie chicken. Animal had Chicken Veggie Ramen.I forgot to mention we heard a crazy loud animal call last night. Yep....a moose! Crazy loud & crazy weird sound!! Praying that I get to see one of those behemoths!! Today, Big & Animal saw huge moose tracks in the mud! Big went on & on about how big they were, he just couldn't believe it!! Oh man....I can't wait!!The Struggle is real!! Wildcat Mountain was a doisey!! It really took all they had!! Hard hiking day.

Big Cypress & Animal slept in the shelter because they arrived late, 8 pm. Plus the weather was expected to be rainy tonight. They switched roles, Big got sleep things ready and Animal got water. They ate & went to bed by 9.
Highlights of today's hike. (As tough as the whites, from other hiker reports) Mt Hayes @2555', Page Pond, Dream Lake, Mt Success @ 3565'
Great at 58 (Bob)& his wife JoAnn and son Bobby, left their RV at our parking spot last night. They slept at the White Mtn Hostel next door. I chatted with them for a few minutes. It had been almost 3 weeks since we saw Great at 58. He wasn't with his family then, so it was nice to put it all together now!!
I saw Sasquat before leaving Gorham at about 11:30am. He was on McDonald's mission. So we didn't visit long. I spent the morning learning how to set GPS Coordinates in truck navigation. After much struggle, I realized I could put the AWOL guide GPS location #'s in Google & it would convert it to lat & longitude degree #'s I need to put into the truck navigation. I don't know why there is different #'s or how it converts from one system to the other, but....it works!! So, now I have all the AWOL guide parking locations loaded into the truck navigation! Would've been nice to figure it out back in VT, but....at least God granted me patience to figure it out this morning. Till this morning, I was using Google & Guthook App to drop a pin on a location, that I guessed was the spot, in some cases following curves in the road & guessing. It worked for VT & NH, just took a long time. 
After a stop in Bethel ME for gas, water refills & block ice at Dunkin Donuts/gas station...yes I admit a donut & egg & cheese croissant too. Oliver & I stopped at the Mother Walker waterfall. Took a very short walk, didn't see much, went the other direction, seeing a sign. It's marking an old stage coach road. I got Pictures & Oliver got to mark trees! We passed the pull off for the Moose Cave. I'd rather skip it, I believe steps are involved, plus I'd rather wait to experience these things with my best friend, Big Cypress. We (WishBone)& I arrived at the parking spot at about 3. No cell phone service! Several cars & RV. So...we take a walk, take some pictures, meet Ruth, driving the RV. She's from Jacksonville FL and we spent the rest of our day & evening talking! We gave trail magic to,
Safety Pin from Austin TX and
Whitenoise from Norwich, Norfolk about 100 miles from London. They have been hiking together since The Smokies. Not sure if it's a trail romance, but I'd like to think so! Coffee/cocoa, Ruth gave them bananas, ice cream & sodas. We took their trash too! The cars slowly left. Ruth & I moved our vehicles closer to the trail head. Ruth invited me for chili! It was delicious & we talked until a bit after 7. Ruth is trailmom, per Turtle. She is trail supporting her daughter, Chasing freedom & boyfriend, Hipbelt. Except for a little needed RV repair, that took her off trail support for a couple weeks, she's been there since GA!! That's great! They reported it took them 2 1/2 hours to do The Mahoosuc Notch, it was wet & slippery. Fiber said for about 2 hours! But, that's tomorrow's adventure!
8:22pm, I'm the only vehicle left in the parking lot. This is a first! Usually there are other cars left behind, with people off hiking. I just heard an owl. Its far away, because it was very faint. I also hear a rodent, assuming mouse, crawling around on the underside of the truck. This isn't the first time! Usually nightly...I just keep forgetting to mention it. The are fond of peanut butter. So...those type things are locked in the cooler. They have nibbled on a Cliff Bar here & there. They don't eat much & have been fond of the paper towels, just taking a little bit for nest building.","US 2 Gorham NH

""The most difficult OR fun mile of the AT"" ""Make your way through jumbled pit of boulders."" At 2165'. Big & Animal say yes to both. ""Difficult at the time, but yet fun!"" Then they went on to Mahoosuc Arm at 3770'. Big commented that the trail went off a cliff, yes a cliff! To the shelter last night. They both thought...""that can't be the way"", but it was. (I forgot to mention that yesterday). After the arm came Speck pond and then the Eyebrow. I met trail maintenance volunteers, that are currently building new trail with over 500 rock steps on Eyebrow trail. Today I met, Quiet from Norfolk VA and Foxy from Tallahassee FL. With them was GI Joe, who needed some booboo care. So, I gave him some wipes & hydrogen peroxide for his head and leg gashes. They all had coffee and cell phone charges.WishBone & I met a Tour Group that hiked a mile to Table Top trail & back. WishBone got some love from the ladies, even a treat from one lady with dog cookies in her pocket. Bluejay, Blister & Trout did hello & goodbye pitstop. Not in need of anything except trash dump and this park offers a can, so...easy peasy! Carrot arrived in need of a water bottle. She was going to dig one out of the trash, but I gave her our small Sawyer bag, when we see her she can return it, but it's ok if we never see it. Not the end of the world and she doesn't have to get one from the trash can!! She did look though lol. Thankful she didn't have to.Boobytrap and Gandolph had coffee with Carrot, then the 3 were off again. Babushka W/ husband Spudnik from Philly arrived early evening and visited and had coffee. Then, I finally met Liz. She is trail supporting, Jay, her husband & Katie 18 yr old daughter. We sat and visited for several hours!! A delight!! We had just called it a night at about 7:30, moments later I hear voices & see head lamps, from North & South directions. Our hikers arrived at the same exact time! It's a God thing, Liz exclaimed!! Definitely, I agree!!We got dinner, foot care, pie from Jo & Frank. They are from FL & big hikers! Even gave us DVD's of their hikes. From all over the place. Jo even hiked from Key West to Newfoundland!! Astonishing!! They shared a pie, they bought on the side of the road. Yes, instead of a fruit or vegetable stand it was pies & woopie pies. With a leave your money, honesty box! The pie was blueberry & blackberry and Animal loved it. I didn't worry that Big wouldn't like it, he likes everything! Except grape jelly! Several times today Big Cypress & Animal heard...you can't or you shouldn't do the notch & arm on the same day. Well, hind sight, they wouldn't, but they did and lived to tell the tale. Several falls were taken. Animal thought for sure dad was gonna need a helicopter off the trail. But....after 5 minutes rest, and MUCH surprise by both, nothing broken and off they went!! Big said, ""God took care of me on that one, cuz I knowI should've been all broken.""I had found a decent stealth spot for Animal and helped him set up his tent. Big & I talked for a longer than usual time tonight, not really getting to sleep until after 10 pm. ""It's so good to be here with you, I really miss you on the trail"", Big expressed & to sleep we went.","Carlo Col Shelter

Slept in until about 6:30. Pancakes, coffee & visit with Liz as Jay & Katie were off before I could meet them. Big Cypress & Animal hit the trail about 9am. I didn't look. Just as I was about to leave to head to Liz's campsite, Wildfire showed up. He was asking about Andover & what direction it was. Well....I was heading that direction, so cleared the front seat & off we went to Little Red Hen Diner & Bakery. We had breakfast & used WiFi. Miss Hunter, our server was a delight & I had the best omelette in my life!! Yes...I'm serious!! It was a Greek omelette, but out of feta cheese, so I said just whatever cheese will do. So basically it was a veggie omelette. Perfect!! Not greasy, not wet, veggies not soggy!! Plus, homemade bread! I had a grilled homemade english muffin. That's a thing I noticed few states back...grilled toast, instead of toaster toasted. L o v e it!! I gassed up at the General Store and while pumping, there's Ruth, arriving at the corner. She pulled in and we chatted a minute. She's at South Arm Campground tonight. Chasing Freedom & Hipbelt are a day ahead of us. The campground is listed as open until Oct 1, but they are closing today, but letting Ruth stay there, On the cheap, because they are turning of the water & electric. Ruth has water & generator, so is fine with that.I saw Bob/Great at 58, pop out of the woods near the meeting spot for today. He's done 10 miles by 1-ish and 10 more to go today. I asked him to tell Liz, I'm sorry I didn't show up at her camp this morning. (If he sees her before I do) I feel bad I told her I was coming for water & shower, but unplanned trip with Wildfire and in the opposite direction from her camp spot.Now 2:09 pm. Hot water made for foot soaking. Visit with Sarah/Lil Scooby, an off the grid homesteader, that gives rides to hikers from this parking spot to the hostel in Andover. She checks the parking spot daily, while she gets multiple buckets of water for home. Her husband is a disabled retired Marine, 29 years old and they have a 1 & 2 year old. Their dream is to off the grid homestead in Alaska, but he's born & raised here, so.... She stayed only a few minutes and was off like a gust of wind. It's great meeting so many interesting people!! I love it!!Big Cypress saw Omega and Omega recognized Big and he blurted out ""Big Cypress, what are you doing here??"" We last saw him in Massachusetts. Wow!! Crazy!!Drove back into Andover. After Big Cypress took a dip in a pool of a stream flowing next yo the trail and calling his name! He walked back to the trail after dropping his pack with me. We had an amazing Lobstah Roll at the General Store and a everything pizza. Animal had a Double Double Burger and a slice of our pizza. We saw Spuknik and Babushka, then Quiet and Chupacabra. Walked back aross the street to our sleep spot at Little Red Hen's back yard. Hiker friendly, let's hikers sleep in the back yard. Shower in morning $5, laundry $5 a load. We'll have breakfast there in the morning!! My guys loved the pumpkin whoopie pies I got them from LRH's bakery. Critter Report: Lots of Turkey and Northern Flickers, spotted by Moonbeam.

We did some internet things, like Banking & ordering Big new pants for delivery in Stratton. He had the seam give out in the butt, praying the sewing holds.Conversation at breakfast...Big had a bit of a friction issue yesterday, he had to hike with his hand as a sport cup for the last two miles.

Oliver & I got daddy the bodyglide & I bought a AT baseball cap. Then we were off to IGA for some treats. Then the Farmhouse Inn, to talk to Miss Stacey. She's going to advise me on the local roads (gravel & dirt). As we were questioning Barnjam Rd. Stacey said it is under some construction and had some tricky turns & easy to get lost. So....we are going to avoid that scenario! Meeting them at ME4 for lunch then skipping Barnjam Rd, they will sleep in the woods, I in a cozy parking area on the trail. Back to Miss Stacey & husband Shane, they offered a shower & laundry, if I needed. They have owned the property for 2 years. Doing lots of construction and its an amazing home & Inn. Lovely, just lovely, couple & home/Inn. I filled our water reservoirs and was on my way. The drive was nice, short & lots of signs warning of Moose. Haven't seen one yet, unfortunately!!When I arrived at the parking area for AT, Miss Ruth's camper with Chasing Freedom & Hipbelt were there. I visited with them, in the warmth and dryness of the camper. Later, I spotted Gandolph & Boobytrap. A few minutes after they got a hitch into town, I met Skibow from South Carolina. He had some coffee with me, when Big Cypress & Animal arrived at about 1:15 pm. I snagged them a Huge sandwich, I should've taken a picture of it. It was as wide as long, cut in half & my hungry hikers made it disappear quickly. They sat & removed wet boots & equally wet socks. A smell, that indescribable, hangs over our area as we eat & visit. Wet hiker is a smell that's worse than the plain ol' few days of no shower hiker. So....after a quick lunch & loading of complete gear, as a night in the woods is their plan tonight. Rain stopped today about noon, cold front is here.I arrived at ME 27 about 3:30-4 pm. No privy as described on Guthook App. I walked WishBone & had my dinner of Ramen Pad Thai (I love that trail meal, you add peanut butter right before eating). Then we got snug & warm in the back of the truck. I'm currently listening to A Walk in the Woods, about the AT by Bill Bryson. It's much better than the movie of 2015. 5:30 pm, A motor.... pausing by WishBone & I, I peak up, it's Liz! She was curious if I wad in the back or out on a walk. We chatted a bit, getting chilled at about 630, we called it a night! She slept in the back of her white Honda van, next to our white Tundra truck. It's going to be a cold night.

The drive was a little precarious, as the water is only inches from the roadside and not wide enough in most places for two vehicles to get passed each other. But....we made it without incident!! My hikers arrived at about 330, in good spirits and both wanting a foot bath tonight. We had a small campfire and dinner of chicken sausage with red onion & green pepper, Velveeta Shells & cheese and Animal added a dehydrated trail meal after his first dinner.Walking before bed to snap a couple pics we met, Bear Keeper & her lil Bear (Yorky dog, thru hiking mostly by puppy pack). We also saw NoName at 443pm, he's the hiker that helped save Animal the other night, when he got lost getting water.Critter Report:Loon and lots of little birds I couldn't see well enough to ID.","Otter Pond Rd

Two Peas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549866,"Moxie Pond 2049.8 to Lake Hebron parking area 2071.3 for 21.5 miles today.
Highlights: Moxie Bald Mountain at 2629' and several stream & the East Branch of the Piscatiquis River. Supposed to ford this river, but all hikers have said it's a rock hop, as water levels are crazy low. (Not enough snow melt & rain, drought conditions out here)
32 degrees this morning! Nuff said! We did enjoy eggs with onion & green pepper left-over from last night. Bacon we've been carrying since VT & The Edge Farm stand. I also took a hand from the this neck of the woods playbook, toast....grilled or toasted?! Since we now have butter and no toaster, grilled toast it was. Delicious!!
Big & Animal were on trail by 7 am. I was on my side of the trail via gravel chatter bump roads. Well.....even the paved roads are pretty bumpy, due to the freezing and thawing that helps that process happen. I took some cool fog pictures this morning, I bet Big did too! 
Pit stop at Kingsbury Lake, 4 Loon were swimming in the morning light & fog drifting on the lake top. Gorgeous!! 
Stopped in Monson at the Irving gas station, I fill up every town stop, as I'm clueless as to how far towns are with an open gas station. Most are the old handle flip style & they don't make you pay first - they actually trust you to come in and pay after you pump. (Oh the good ol' days). Then to Shaws Hostel for road talk. They know the 100 Mile Wilderness area, which starts here and the ins & outs of road conditions & accessibility. We will be going onto private roads that have gates with a toll shack. Looks as though it'll cost an average of $20 a road. We have 4 planned stops in the 100 MW. After using the WiFi to update our journal, WishBone & I ran the 2 miles to our sleep spot. Then, I realized I forgot to check the weather report, so back to Shaws. Friendly Nate & Delicious needed a ride to the ME 15 trail head. So...weather checked & hikers loaded & dropped. Delicious is a fellow Michigander....from Petoskey, currently living in Ann Arbor area. 
3:35 pm, at our sleep spot & birds are tweeting, every so often a Loon will call. I love that call! WishBone on the other hand does NOT! Barks every time!! Goodness sake!! Greeted by Kerri & Carol, they stopped n chatted. I walked with them to the trail head. They were sprucing up an AT sign and a few minutes later....there's my guys!! 4 pm just as I suspected!! They would've arrived sooner, but saw Turtle Tracks again and received trail magic of cheeseburgers & soda. (Saw him right by Height of Land). He needs prayers, as he will be having brain tumor surgery on Oct 11. He's told its non cancerous and we will definitely pray that's the case.

After a 4 pancake breakfast whipped up by yours truly, Moonbeam. WishBone & I had a nice easy drive of 2 miles to Shaws Hostel. Where I got a shower and did our laundry. While sitting & visiting with other hikers, like NoName, Liz walked in. We chatted about roads & caught up on things. One being, going to register at ATC office in Monson, at the Community Center. While there I can also make our camping reservations for Baxter. The center didn't open until noon, so Liz went on her way and I stuck around town to meet up with Ruth. She & I text this morning and made plans to go out to lunch. So...about 11:45 Ruth arrived & to Pete's we headed. Open face, 1 slice bread fancy grilled cheese. It was delicious!! We checked out the resupply room they have, got Little Debbie Nutty Bars, Goldfish crackers as a stand in for Cheezits, as Animal is craving & wanting to summit with. I'm to hide (as he requested)a bag from him, to have at Katahdin, so he doesn't devour all beforehand. Lol After lunch, Ruth & I head to the Community Center, met Miss Patty. Very very helpful!! Got everything all taken care of. We will be camping at Baxter tent spot #21. Liz & fam are in a lean-to spot #10. You can't put a tent up on their site, or we were going to share! Darn! I even made WishBones arrangements for Katahdin Kritters. No pets on Baxter property. Baxter is like Ft Knox, maybe more strict! It's not really a State Park, even though it has that title. They can't have any improvements made to the wilderness of it. So, no electricity, no water, no improvements at all. When the land was Trust to the state this was one of the rules. The rangers are like moms, they have eyes in the back of their heads and know Everything (underscore for dramatic effect)that is going on with people and hikers in the park. The park & wilderness are the priority, NOT the visitors.This visit to the Community center was difficult...I didn't realize I would have this reaction....yep....I got a bit emotional! Didn't expect it really and it didn't happen right away. It happen when I looked at the calendar with Big Cypress & Animals names in the box for Oct 6. It made it real, that my name wasn't there! VERY BIG S i g h......So, I arrived at meeting spot at 3:40 or so, then get to my ""chores"", make hot water, make hot coffee, set up camp chairs, camp table if needed, etc...Today, with my late arrival I barely had time, as I heard my hikers voices at 4:30. Snacks, foot soaking, peanut butter & jelly sandwiches were on thr menu while our dehydrated meals rehydrated (Bean Stew/Spicy shrimp Ramen/Tuna casserole Ramen). We also had Canadian Donuts and some various Little Debbie snacks. Bed by 6 pm. Hard to believe we are under 100 miles left, 99.2 to be exact.Critter Report: Animal met with an angry group of ground nesting yellow jackets. Big Cypress had to help save Animal from further stings. He's fine, but suffered about a dozen stings. Anti itch cream & anti histamine to the rescue from his MacGyver (like the TV show), meaning Moonbeam to the rescue. The boys, when younger, said I had everything one would need in any situation, either in my purse or glove box or somewhere in the vehicle. Yep....95% of the time, I/we do (Big Cypress is also well prepared). Just like Max Lucado said in Traveling Light, from a time long ago when I raised my three right hand fingers. (Girlscouts & Boyscouts....always be prepared). Crisis averted, no serious harm to our Animal!! I forgot to mention I saw an otter a couple days ago. It was on the side of the road and darted off as I approached.","Lake Hebron parking spot

Two Peas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549951,"Picture sent this morning. Journal to come later.
Otter Pond 2089.9 to Katahdin Ironworks Rd (aka K I road) 2104.4 for 14.5 miles.
Highlights for today: Barren Ledges 2017', Barren Mtn. 2660', Fourth Mtn. 2380', Mt Three and a Half ( I'm not making up these names ) at 1958', Third Mtn. 2097', Columbus Mtn. 2325', and Chairback Mtn. 2180'
Rain off and on last night. More like sprinkles, but any case wetness coming down. It wasn't rainy when we got up at 6. So, we had toast of the french. Big Cypress had 6, Animal 4 and I had 2 and the tiny end. Quick like bunnies, they were off at a few minutes after 7. 
Coffee ""trailmagic"" for Sunshine from TN and Fremont from near Seattle WA. 
Animal arrived at 2:15, I had only been there 30 minutes, rough gravel roads of many more miles than they hiked today. Plus, the roads are privately owned, in this area, so you must stop at the office & the Caretaker asks you the pertinent questions, fills out your permission form, which you carry with you & return upon exiting, and pay your fee. Our fee was $12 for me & the truck. For today only. Leave & return, you pay again! Craziness!! The gentleman for my first gate experience was super nice, like a grandpa, that sounded like Sean Connery-the actor. He was also very chatty & I was anxious....didn't want them to arrive before me. 
Big Cypress arrived about 30 minutes later. Animal was ""tailgating"" him & in a trip incident Big Cypress went backwards to try & catch himself, but was snafood by the closeness & down he went, Big...not Animal. So....Animal went on ahead of daddy, to prevent further incidents! 
The usual PB&J's were had, along with various snacks & such. We all had our dehydrated trail meal, we aren't fond of (good, but Big & I have grown tired of them). Animal had Chicken Couscous, I had Tuna Casserole Ramen & Big Cypress had clam chowder. We were going to have tacos, but full tummies after dinner #1...we rested and then too tired to get ourselves up to eat again, so....taco day tomorrow!! Something to look forward to!! Animal got our water from the brook tonight & found his tent spot there too. Right next to the AT on the right, nice flat spot, his tent not the first to claim the real estate. 
Critter Report: 7:33am, 1 doe in a field near our sleep spot last night. 2 more Doe on the side of Elliotsville Rd. A Northern Flicker and one female grouse. Turkey Mama & babies. Great blue heron. A big fluffy, deep red, Fox. It's tail looked as though it was dipped in paint! It crossed the road in front of the truck, very close, but too quick for a picture!! Just a snapshot in my minds eye!","Otter Pond

Only about in the 50's for high temp.We got up to tinkle at 1 am. Greeted by what seemed to be fireflies, and Many of them. It's chilly at night & I don't know much about them, thought they were a summer bug. So....I need to Google that. If not fireflies, some other bug with bioluminescence abilities, just like fireflies. Goldenboy had a thought about them, he said they were the last ones to find mates for the season and the dimness of their glow was them running out of juice to find mates! Funny, and maybe true! Snap from NJ, start Feb 27 hikescameraadventure is his Instagram name. Then came,Goldenboy from CA March 5, traveling with Finch from Germany start date March 7. Then SOBO - no trail name yet, real name Eddie. No time for coffee, just took our bags of trail mix (aka-""nut bags"") and asked if I've seen many SOBO's as he's lonely! I arrived at Jo-Mary Rd. Paid $12 for me & truck, plus $10 for 2 nights sleep out on the roads in the area. On my way in, I see a big orange tent...White Honda van....It's Liz!! WishBone & I stop for a visit for couple hours. We look at road maps, talk story and Liz gives us some oatmeal we forgot about the other day. We will see them again on Wednesday at Baxter. WishBone took me for a little walk on the N side of the AT crossing, very smooth so doable for this Moonbeam, still very much healing! 2:27 pm now, taco meat prepared, journaling and I hear woodpeckers, Squirrels and brightly colored autumn leaves that can no longer hang on to their trees, hitting the ground!! I LOVE AUTUMN!!So, this is not our sleep spot, at Kokadjo/B Pond Rd. It's our road crossing 7.1 miles before our planned sleep spot. It was suggested to us to add those miles to tomorrow, as the trail is flat & a bed of pine needles. That would mean 30 mile day tomorrow. So....with the knee incident of yesterday, I came here, just in case pressing the last 7 was too much. We shall see!!?? They arrived about 3:15 pm, ate sandwiches and continued on. Animal went without his pack & sticks, just a bottle of water, leaving at 3:40. Big carried his pack & used sticks as always, leaving at 4. They arrived at sleep spot at 5:30-ish, almost before me!! FYI the suggestion that the trail, the last 50 or 60 miles to Katahdin is ""flat"" & ""easy"" and ""a bed of pine needles"".....yes, it's somewhat easier, but nothing what we were told or heard.....as usual!! Perspective!!Critter Report:WoodduckSalamander - brown with black pin stripe down the sides. The Fireflies Woodpecker, a little brown bird larger than sparrow but smaller than Robin.

Second morning waking to drivers side rear tire at only 10 pounds of pressure. Quick-ish fill with our mini jump starter/air compressor and off we went!! Headlights on highbeam, since it's just barely getting light. I see a big dark mass on up ahead on the right, where road meets trees. But there's a bend in the road, oh man...can it be? Driving closer to the bend, yes....yes it's a moose. I see her hind end and she prances down the road a second or two and off into the woods she went. I yelled out ""Oliver...its a moose, mommy sees a moose...hurry look, a moose, Oliver its a moose!"" Yahhh!!! Thank you Lord for my moose sighting!! It's been 10 years since my great Michigan, moose expedition (camping in U.P.-Sept/Oct) of 2006. With no luck at all, barely saw deer, for Pete sake!! So, almost two and half hours to get off the roads via Jo-Mary Rd and out of the 100 Mile Wilderness. Let's just say, chatter bumps are of Satan!! Ridiculous!! We dropped off our road pass paper at the guard shack, gentlemen says, ""you must be Ruth."" ""Nope, but I know her and glad she's here and ok!"" I sent her a text and told her I was going to Millinocket, then Baxter, hope to see her later. So, I hit the Hannaford grocery. Then gas station, then a lead on a garage to fix the tire and here I sit. Gettin'r fixed!! 11:05 am, done!! Next chore was a load of laundry, mainly mine, but Big's night clothes and one pair of socks. I had a nice chat with a lady prepping for her winter trip to Arkansas to be with her daughter & grand children. Then, I head to Katahdin Kritters, to drop WishBone at doggie day care for the night. No dogs allowed at Baxter!! He was playing with some puppies, so adjusting well and when I left he was getting love from Miss Kelly. I'm sad he'll miss the grand finale!! We got texts from Rabbit and Unknown. They must have sensed us getting close. I then text Subman & Suds, Fiber, Steady & Teach, Crash and Rabbit and Unknown ...our families too....to let the know that tomorrow is the big day!! It's 35 miles from camp spot at Baxter to the doggy day care. It took me a almost 2 hours to get there. One pit stop for water at the campground we are staying at tomorrow night, Wilderness Edge Campground. Miss Wendy was super helpful today. Let me shower & camel up, super great!! I arrived at a few minutes before 4, and Liz, Jay & Katie are here. Along with, Friendly Nate, Huckleberry, TwoSoles. I visited with Liz for a few minutes after getting wood for a fire, while setting Animals tent up & we hear treking poles...its Big & Animal!! They made it in awesome time, even stopped fir double scoop of ice cream at Abol Bridge store. We visited with hikers and I made burgers for dinner, we feasted and then to bed! 7 pm. Hiker midnight!!Big Cypress was in Baxter near a waterfall and was officially greeted to Maine by the local Indian Chief, Fred Moore. Tribe name means - Where the Land Meets the Water. The tribes main way to make a living, back in the day, was speer fishing. Now its mainly as fishing guides. The chief was so excited to meet a thru hiker, he asked to get a picture with Big Cypress. We will have to Google him to get in touch with him, once we are home. Big Cypress said he took a selfie, Animal was behind a bit, at the mile 21 marker. He started to walk away & then it just hit him, he started crying, a laughing kinda cry, he said. In awe of it all!! He said God is Good All the time!! Even in the bad to us, He is Good!! The trail was very pretty woods and lots of rivers & streams, waterfalls & ponds. It was a water kinda day!

Big said he didn't sleep well, I slept ok. But, I was up at 3:30 and never went back to sleep. I put on a warmer fleece layer over my sleep clothes and made quick work of my morning trail support jobs. Eggs and oatmeal were on the menu, oatmeal was off menu quickly as donuts were put in its place. We had breakfast around the campfire, nice & warm! Tent stayed up to dry out, and that helped Animal to be ready when Big was!! First time, since Aug 30 in VT. Animal & morning don't get along!! They were on trail at 6 am. Our tent site is on the trail, so easy peasy! Site 21 is awesome!! I went to the ranger station at 7 to get them checked in. As I missed it last night, shut the door at 5, oops. So...Animal was #1087 and Big Cypress #1088. Liz went to our site and got worried because I wasn't there. She met me on the path to ranger office. We visited, had coffee and joined for coffee by Huckleberry's dad and granddad. Sat around the fire to stay warm. In the 30's maybe 40 degrees this morning. Close to or about 70 high for today. Clear & Sunny & Gorgeous!! Liz packed up camp. Ladybug joined me for coffee and waited for his ride. Liz head out to Abol Campground about 11 am. I went for a walk up the trail toward the summit. Its pretty nice trail, not too many roots & rocks! I left some hearts made with red maple leaves and a couple with yellow leaves, not sure tree make or model. I also found some twigs on the ground and fashioned Two Peas, in a couple places on trail edge. I can't believe we are here! It's 12:42 now, Big thought they would be back by 1. I told him not to rush, take his time & be safe! The Lord has watched over us and walked/hiked/climbed, and drove with us!! He isn't going to stop now! I did hear the helicopter this morning, can't bear to walk to the rangers office to check. Yesterday 2 day hikers needed rescued off the mountain, the ranger told me this morning when I was checking them in. PS, the rangers have been nothing but amazing! Don't believe what you may hear. I guess sometimes your bad experience, could be Your Bad experience!For the accomplishment, Animal gets a special card for completing his 582 miles, Big does too for his Thru Hike, along with the paperwork to get his 2,000 Miler Certificate. I believe the card is mainly for the 100 Mile Wilderness or as Liz says, the 100 Acre Woods!!1:30 pm, Big Cypress logged n the trail register that party of two returned from the summit. Even though Animal had stayed behind to help an older injured hiker, down to the tree line. Two other hikers took over for Animal and cared for the gentleman. Animal arrived at about 2 pm. So....when I saw a brown hat & blue shirt through the trees, I knew it was Big. I started walking towards him and I completely lost it, I was a blubbering mess. Just about hysterical!! We hugged for several minutes and I regained my composer. We sat & talked & Big Cypress ate, while we waited for Animal. When Animal finally arrived, I greeted him up the trail with a fist bump and congratulations!! Ok, so Big and I were talking about this last 5 miles. ""If I didn't have to go up there in order to finish I wouldn't have, I would have turned around & went down."" ""It's a dangerous mountain & precarious edges."" Hats Off and DEEP bow to those who have reached the sign for that famous finish picture and Conquered their fear of heights etc....Friendly Nate met them while they were up on the mountain, they were coming down and Friendly Nate going up. Bam....Friendly Nate grabbed Big Cypress in a bear hug and said Congratulations!! Big Cypress knows now how he got his trail name. They also saw Jay & Katie, on the Table area of summit, Jay said ""that was interesting"" pause for effect ""in a facetious way."" Then they parted ways, saying ""we will see you later."" The summit was littered with Day hikers aka Filthy Hikers, as they don't care for the environment as much as thru hikers (in our hiker family experience) as one hiker put it, we live in the woods and you don't poop in your living room! We left Baxter and head for the campground for showers and snack/sandwich. Then into town to wash our stinky clothing and sleep gear. Hannaford's grocery for two whole rotisserie chickens, one for each. I had a little wrap with some lunch meat. In camp at 7pm, bed by 7:20pm. Texting the family and our hiker family, until my folks & Suds had me in tears. My parents had to say goodbye to their beloved kitty, Chloe. She was very sick. Then Suds was blubbering at my texts, which made me even more emotional. A long journey comes to an end. Not as we had envisioned, but still an experience we won't ever forget, an experience that changed us in ways we see now and ones that won't show themselves until later. It was a big mental challenge, along with the beatings our bodies took after hiking daily day in and day out. Not to mention the broken femur!! We made our network of hiking family bigger and that know the Struggle Was Real!! Thank you Jesus for keeping us safe and hiking beside us. Thank you Animal for relaying this journey, taking over the 582 miles I/ Moonbeam couldn't complete. God saw that you needed to spend time with your dad and made it all happen! Thankfulness flows from this momma's heart!
